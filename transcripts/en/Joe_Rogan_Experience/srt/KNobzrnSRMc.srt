1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,970
B,
two,

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,470
one.
Hello,

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,730
Steven.
Hello Joe.

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:06,780
Welcome.
Thank you.

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,471
Thanks for coming,
man.

6
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:08,850
I really appreciate it.
Thanks for having me.

7
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,560
I've enjoyed a bunch of your shit 
online,

8
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,394
man.
You've got some really fucking cool 

9
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:15,390
articles and some great ideas.
And uh,

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,020
we were talking about,
um,

11
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,890
the other day,
a friend of mine,

12
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:20,724
we're talking about creativity and the 
source of creativity and how to 

13
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,264
cultivate creativity and I stumbled 
across something that you had on your 

14
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,314
website about creativity,
about different methods or different 

15
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:36,741
ways to try to inspire your creativity 
or shock your system into creativity.

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,870
I'm always really impressed with people 
who take things that I've always like,

17
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,440
man,
I wonder why or when my ideas come from.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,393
And then I go,
oh,

19
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,830
check out this guy.
He actually kind of broke this shit down

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,190
and tried to figure out what was the 
source of.

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,220
A lot of these ideas is aware where 
these,

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,630
these groovy moments of spontaneous,
you know,

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,170
just just like a blossoming of ideas 
where they come from.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,220
My mechanistic,
I like to know how the shit works.

25
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,910
Yeah,
I've seen that by talking to you just in

26
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:12,390
the past 10 minutes.
You've got like order,

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,200
so it's a show,
but thank you.

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,870
But you have like,
you know,

29
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:20,940
like when I was talking about you want 
cream in your coffee,

30
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:24,900
like no drink should have one thing,
scotch neat.

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,160
You know,
coffee,

32
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,630
black,
you've got,

33
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,420
you've got order or opinions.
Yes.

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,060
But in your mind there it's very rigid,
right?

35
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,360
I mean it there liberating structures to
me.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,540
I do everything like that.
I do six things in my life I've ever.

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,430
If it doesn't fall into those 
categories,

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,950
I don't do it.
You know,

39
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,063
I mostly just at discovered years ago 
that the only stuff I've failed at was 

40
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:50,550
the stuff when I was too over extended 
and I was quitting,

41
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,700
I would give up half way,
but if I could stick to it always led to

42
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,150
success.

43
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,691
So I was like,
okay,

44
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:56,680
let's pare it down to essential.
Well,

45
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,210
and whenever life gets crazy for me,
my first instinct is go small,

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,073
get small.
One of the hardest things I think about 

47
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,870
being married and running an animal 
sanctuary,

48
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:06,000
my wife is.
There's so many dependents on me now.

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,610
When stuff gets difficult,
I can no longer get small.

50
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,670
You can't minimalize and get down to a 
duffle bag.

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,560
I have a friend of mine,
Steve Maxwell,

52
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,920
he literally lives out of a,
like a dry sack,

53
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,023
you know,
one of those dry socks that you could 

54
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,450
just throw in the river and that's like,
here's a Duffel bag.

55
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,990
That's his whole thing.
He Lives Hotel to hotel travels all over

56
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,824
the world,
teaching people a strength and 

57
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:30,120
conditioning routines and wellness and 
health.

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,490
That's all he does.
He just,

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,330
he has nothing.
He has no items.

60
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,420
He has a like a ipad and he's got a 
watch.

61
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,303
When I was writing my first book,
it was right out of college before I 

62
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,670
went to Grad school.
Uh,

63
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,880
I lived in a place called anti matters,
one of the largest performance and video

64
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:49,881
gallery video galleries in the world.
It was in San Francisco and huge space.

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,680
20 people living there.
But I lived above the tool room on a,

66
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,383
a plank of wood,
the size of a Volkswagen microbus you 

67
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,773
like,
crawled over my bed to get to my desk 

68
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,053
and my clothes were on one side and 
there were books on the other that was 

69
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,190
it.
And it was small and tiny and you know,

70
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,810
crazy.
But it was a great,

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,673
you know,
I got to spend a couple of years there 

72
00:03:09,461 --> 00:03:10,294
and it where I started writing my first 
novel and it was just wonderful owning 

73
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,144
nothing and being that free.
That seems like one of those things 

74
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,680
where it sounds like a really good idea 
if you don't have to do it forever.

75
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
Like if someone said,
uh,

76
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,680
this is how I'm going to live for 
awhile,

77
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:21,400
you be like,
Ooh,

78
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,050
cool.
But if you said this is how I'm going to

79
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,460
live for the rest of my life,
and be like,

80
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:25,061
oh,
that poor,

81
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:27,200
fuck weird.
Right?

82
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,840
Yeah.
It's always a good thing to do.

83
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,830
When I was 18,
19,

84
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,760
20,
whatever it was,

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,050
now you know,
I,

86
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,320
you know,
come back and see my crib,

87
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,510
honey.
It's,

88
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,540
yeah,
that wouldn't work.

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,990
But like this idea that you have of like
coffee black,

90
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,630
but do you,
do you vacillate at all?

91
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,980
Do you vary?
I do.

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,420
Every now and again I'm down.
I got to go from starbucks or something.

93
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,440
No,
I actually would like,

94
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,720
I have an urge to punch people and they 
ordered that crap.

95
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,580
Really?
Why?

96
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,360
I just cause it's Yummy.
Delicious.

97
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,410
I believe you do believe you.
I do know I'll be an asshole.

98
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:04,060
I get that.
But no,

99
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:04,894
it just like I walk in,
I'm like he takes them 17 minutes to 

100
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:09,220
order their coffee and 20 minutes to,
you know,

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,113
make their coffee and I'm sitting there 
and I just want like a small cup of 

102
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,084
coffee,
black place.

103
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,983
But let's be honest,
if you're ordering coffee from 

104
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:17,110
starbucks,
you have shitty tasting coffee anyway.

105
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,550
Their coffee tastes terrible.
True.

106
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,250
That if you're going to,
you're going to get burnt coffee for the

107
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,084
most part.
The thing about starbucks is it's 

108
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,720
convenient and consistent,
but it's not good.

109
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,590
Right?
What are you measuring against?

110
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,080
Are you measuring,
install their other copy?

111
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,510
Are you talking about what was there 
before starbucks?

112
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,261
We,
yeah.

113
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,150
Well,
well you can get diner coffee,

114
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,170
which is even worse.
Right.

115
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,140
One thing that starbucks does have is 
that weird machine.

116
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:45,310
What the fuck is that called?
Is a compressed clover clover?

117
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,443
Yeah.
It's like a.

118
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,790
it's ridiculously expensive machine.
I think it might cost 50 or $60,000.

119
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:52,803
It might be even more than that.
And starbucks bought up the patent for 

120
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:58,780
them and the guys who invented it,
some series geniuses,

121
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,940
dis.
They were coffee dorks and they said,

122
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:01,774
okay,
let us find out what is the exact 

123
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,204
correct temperature for each individual 
being program a bruce cycle where you 

124
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:12,790
brew it for the exact correct time for 
each individual being.

125
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:15,670
Obviously it's subjective,
but they got it down to a science,

126
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,820
so inside starbucks is almost the anti 
starbucks,

127
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:19,743
so you have your regular starbucks drip,
which is almost always burnt to a crisp 

128
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,150
and tastes bitter and then they have 
this machine.

129
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,863
It'll come on a second.
This machine that clover and it's a 

130
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,770
digitally programmed a poor.
That stuff in there,

131
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,500
you could only get it at starbucks.
Now the water comes out.

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,930
It's heated to the exact correct 
temperature.

133
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:38,764
They stir it with a whisk and then it 
works on a vacuum and as it goes down 

134
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,214
and presses this thing it the grinds 
come up to the top and you have like 

135
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,410
this hockey puck of grinds,
so like it'll brew it for the exact,

136
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,880
you know,
one minute,

137
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:59,881
15 seconds that this program,
Ethiopian coffee should be brewed for.

138
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,490
Or if you have some sort of Colombian or
some,

139
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,740
you know,
whatever the coffee is,

140
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,390
does,
does it know like you're throwing in.

141
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,840
Yes.
You program it like you,

142
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,070
you know,
you whatever coffee it is,

143
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:13,904
whatever type of coffee.
It has a different individual settings 

144
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,634
for that type of coffee.
So then it brews it and then when the 

145
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:21,800
six seconds is up,
see it lifts up like this and that's the

146
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,634
grinds it or the grounds rather.
And then the coffee comes out and it is 

147
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:33,341
really good and the coffee comes out the
perfect coffee cup size and then the top

148
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:35,600
thing when it comes up,
it's like this.

149
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,570
A hockey puck have used up coffee 
grounds.

150
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,533
Do we know why it's called the clover?
That's a weird name for a coffee 

151
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:43,290
machine.
It is weird,

152
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,183
I don't know,
maybe someone just really likes clovers 

153
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:47,220
and they invented it,
but then you use a little squeegee,

154
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,810
clean that sucker off and that's a wrap 
and you know,

155
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,190
soon there'll be homeless guys cleaning 
off the coffee for you.

156
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,073
Do you think.
So it's a new market for the squeegee 

157
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:56,244
men.
Oh,

158
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,660
squeegee thing.
Yeah.

159
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,440
Nobody knows about that.
La doesn't have the squeegee people.

160
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,023
Too many guns to anything.
I think after the dire wolf wolf 

161
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:08,640
incident,
when the first freeway killer,

162
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,040
I think people got dire wolf.
That's what they called them.

163
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,140
There was a grateful dead song called 
dire wolf,

164
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,360
but it was one of the early freeway 
shooters.

165
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,051
Oh,
out here.

166
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:18,510
Out here.
And I think that sort of like in la,

167
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,550
like we don't want anybody coming.

168
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,580
There are cars because was there one 
freeway shooter?

169
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,180
Was there more than one or more than 
one?

170
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,240
A friend of mine,
uh,

171
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,170
um,
it did a little story about him as a pro

172
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:30,540
skier and he got,
he was driving through the Sierra Nevada

173
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,610
mountains is 20 years ago,
25 years ago.

174
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,693
And somebody,
some snipers perched up on a bridge and 

175
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:35,904
put a bullet into his heart.
Craziest part is he pulled off the 

176
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:40,224
highway,
found a fire station and like walked in 

177
00:07:42,571 --> 00:07:45,000
and like collapsed on a table and had 
been shot in the heart.

178
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,280
Just dropped.
Holy Shit.

179
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,250
Did they catch the guy?
I don't think they ever caught him.

180
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,860
What a crazy impulse

181
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,173
to just decide you're going to make your
life more exciting in this moment by 

182
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,800
taking another person's life.

183
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,520
Very,
very strange,

184
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,120
strange thing.
Thing that happens every now and again.

185
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,690
I mean that's a reoccurring phenomenon.
It's super,

186
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:11,390
super rare,
which is why the people with guns get so

187
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,420
frustrated when someone does something 
like that because they say,

188
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:15,254
well,
the access to guns is not what causes 

189
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:17,444
this.
Someone has to be sick in the head in 

190
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,424
order to do this in the first place and 
you have millions and millions and 

191
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,873
millions of legal gun owners who 
wouldn't even consider doing something 

192
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,154
like this,
but every now and then someone gets on 

193
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:28,844
top of a rock and puts those cross hairs
on a person just for whatever fucking 

194
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:36,080
reason.
Some strange chemical imbalance,

195
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,243
some strange combination of a fucked up 
childhood and very depressing life and 

196
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,010
neurochemistries all out of whack.

197
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,550
You gotta.
I mean I don't.

198
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,830
It's five percent or 10 percent of the 
number.

199
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:51,180
I can't remember which one it is,
but it's psychotic.

200
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:51,890
Just,
you know,

201
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:52,723
just happens.
So if you've got that portion of the 

202
00:08:55,111 --> 00:08:56,130
population that you know

203
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,963
is crazy and doesn't feel empathy,
makes you wonder if we should have guns 

204
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,880
or not.
Well it definitely does,

205
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:04,200
but then it makes you wonder,
well,

206
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,034
they're not going to follow the rules.
Maybe we should have guns just for them 

207
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,340
fuckers.
Fair point.

208
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,473
You never know.
There's like many things in life to 

209
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:15,660
really is no ultimate answer.
Have so many variables going on there.

210
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,950
That is true.
That's why black coffee's not always the

211
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,784
way to go.
Sometimes throw a little cream in that 

212
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:23,040
thing,
man.

213
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,840
Just mix it up a little Stevia.
No,

214
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:28,370
it's got.
I get it.

215
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,640
A little like Ave,
you know,

216
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,250
jack and coke occasionally.
You know,

217
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,580
I understand just every now and okay.
Then we'll go out later.

218
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,200
We'll have pina coladas.
That'd be fine.

219
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,940
There'll be blended,
there'll be frothy.

220
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,560
You'll have an umbrella to become mine.
Umbrellas.

221
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:40,990
Dude,
I'm,

222
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,810
I'm comfortable with my own masculinity.

223
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,940
I will.
I will drink a cosmopolitan boat.

224
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,120
Drinks.
Who drinks here?

225
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:49,020
There's something about those that are 
very unmanly.

226
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:54,021
You're not supposed to be enjoying the 
actual taste of a sugary sweet things if

227
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,350
you're a manly.
No,

228
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:57,300
absolutely not.
Especially not if they have alcohol.

229
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,310
You don't kick ass and drink strawberry 
Daiquiris.

230
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:00,144
It's a contradiction in term.
It seems like you could do it if you 

231
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,750
were like the rock though.
Yeah,

232
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,584
I mean,
who's going to have Mike Tyson once 

233
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,780
daughter Strawberry Daiquiri on backing 
him up.

234
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,783
Yeah.
If like you get to a certain level of 

235
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,074
manliness,
you could just take it completely the 

236
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:12,090
other way.
Absolutely.

237
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:14,490
Wearing clogs.
You just go off,

238
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,440
wear a kilt.
Nobody gives a fuck.

239
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,723
So,
um,

240
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,713
this,
this article that he wrote about 

241
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,510
creativity,
do you remember which one was called?

242
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,190
Which one of you're looking at him?
I do not know the.

243
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,190
You had a bunch of different things 
listed as a various things that people,

244
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,600
you know,
do northern.

245
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,700
It was long haul creativity and that was
it,

246
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,563
so I was looking at kind of a strange 
topic because it turns out very few 

247
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:37,224
people have looked at it and I wasn't.
So there's a lot of work that's been 

248
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:39,954
done.
We can talk about it.

249
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,170
I'm on,
how do I be more creative in the moment?

250
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,510
Right now I'm working on this project,
whatever it is,

251
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,910
but I started getting curious about,
well,

252
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:48,744
what does it take to be super creative 
over the course of a career over 10 

253
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:52,230
years,
20 years,

254
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,250
30 years,
40 years.

255
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,383
And I started to realize that there's a 
lot of kind of points in the life of a 

256
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,124
creative that nobody talks about.
Places we get creative ended up getting 

257
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,930
derailed roadblocks.
I wanted to start taking a look at that.

258
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,580
It may be my next book,
not sure,

259
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,270
but something I've been poking at.
Do you?

260
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,104
Uh,
do you follow Stephen King it all the 

261
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:14,274
writer?
Yeah.

262
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,293
Every now and then.
And I like his book on writing a book 

263
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,541
and reading.
Yeah,

264
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:20,700
that's a really interesting one because 
he kind of,

265
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,713
you know,
a lot of those people that are super 

266
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:24,024
successful and very,
I mean he's probably one of the most 

267
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,220
prolific writers ever.
They have this sort of like just show up

268
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,143
mentality like that.
You people have all these ideas of what 

269
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,000
needs to be in place in order for them 
to be creative.

270
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,930
And Stephen King in a lot of ways is 
saying just fucking do it.

271
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,720
Just sit down every day and do it and 
this is what you do.

272
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,650
You are a writer and this is what you do
and you sit down,

273
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,493
you don't make excuses.
And he went over all the different 

274
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,330
authors that had 19 kids and you know,
put out 50 books and it's just got to do

275
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:54,160
it.

276
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,993
And we have,
have you read the war of Art Steve 

277
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,223
Pressfield's book,
which is amazing in that regard too 

278
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:02,320
because he kind of breaks down.
It's a very small book.

279
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:04,210
It's an easy read for anybody who's 
interested in it,

280
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,403
but he breaks down all the different 
variables that come into play where you 

281
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:10,114
give yourself out and excuses.
And he calls it resistance and beating 

282
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:16,690
that resistance and forcing yourself to 
show up.

283
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:21,691
And then the rewards come for me,
it's wake up at 3:34

284
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,593
AM and I like to be.
I like to be writing before my brain is 

285
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,800
even awake.
I want to be writing within four minutes

286
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:29,600
of getting out of bed because I don't 
want,

287
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,610
you know,
when you sleep,

288
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,980
your brainwaves dropped down kind of to 
the Alpha Theta,

289
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:36,070
borderline alphas,
creative state.

290
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:36,904
And if you wake all the way up,
your brain waves are going to jump all 

291
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,640
the way back up to Beta.

292
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,773
So I don't want that to happen.
I want to keep my brainwaves in that 

293
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,710
kind of create a face.
So I don't.

294
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,040
I never check email first,
never do any of that stuff.

295
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,950
I want to immediately get out of bed,
get to my office,

296
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:53,470
have the coffee brewing,
and then be writing instantly.

297
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,890
That is a very.
That's a very interesting choice.

298
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,660
I like it.
It's very smart.

299
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,650
Trust.
But God damn dude,

300
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:00,490
3:30
AM.

301
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,220
I don't think it's every,
every writer,

302
00:13:03,221 --> 00:13:04,660
every writer.
I don't want to say ever writer.

303
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:09,220
Most of the writers I know tend to find 
time to write when nobody else is awake.

304
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,970
Either they do it late night or I just 
happen to do it early because I.

305
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,193
it's an old habit.
When I was living in San Francisco and 

306
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:18,160
coming up and I was starting as a 
journalist,

307
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:21,250
I was writing my books also Edward who 
is young and hungry.

308
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,220
I had editors in New York would start 
to,

309
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,433
you know,
they were in their twenties to and they 

310
00:13:25,061 --> 00:13:25,721
were,
you know,

311
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,610
they'd get in,
they'd start calling me at 8:30

312
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:30,550
in the morning their time,
which in California was 5:30

313
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,380
in the morning.
The minute an editor called me and said,

314
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,520
hey,
I need you to do this.

315
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:34,810
I was young.
I was hungry.

316
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:35,644
I was poor.
I one of the work with the answer was 

317
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:37,240
yes,
I'm going.

318
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,100
So I wanted to be able to write my books
before that,

319
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,590
so I just started getting up earlier and
earlier.

320
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,043
That's a.
it's probably the best way to do it 

321
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:47,890
because I do the opposite.
I do it when my kids are asleep,

322
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,630
my wife's asleep when everybody's 
asleep,

323
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:52,900
that's when I hit the bong and then go 
crazy,

324
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:57,901
but oftentimes I'll be five,
six hours in and then it'll be 5:00

325
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:59,194
in the morning and then I stopped and 
then I'm freaked out and I just lay in 

326
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,200
bed with my eyes open,
going over all the different things that

327
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:06,034
I just wrote.

328
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:06,850
Well,
that's the.

329
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,790
That's the other reason if I'm,
you know it.

330
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,933
The good news is my.
Most of my writing has probably done at 

331
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,940
least by noon,
right.

332
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:14,290
I'll right from four to 8:00
AM.

333
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,360
Then I get some exercise,
I'll come back,

334
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,310
I'll do another session,
I'll get some more exercise,

335
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,910
but at the end of the day I can shut it 
down because I feel like,

336
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,830
okay,
I thought everything through.

337
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:24,664
I've done everything I possibly can so I
can actually like get some sleep and 

338
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:30,510
started again.
I've heard a lot of people say that like

339
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,160
they'll take a break and then they'll go
for like a long hike,

340
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,300
like,
or they'll do some,

341
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,420
some something that's only mildly 
exerting.

342
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,640
So there's again,
back to creativity,

343
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:40,474
so you know,
I do some work on flow states being in 

344
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:43,144
the zone.
Optimals definitely want to talk to you 

345
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:48,841
about that.
And one of the things we know is there's

346
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,280
something called exercise induced 
transient hypofrontality.

347
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,973
Ooh,
I like the fancy term transient 

348
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,140
hypofrontality.
So when we're in flow,

349
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,873
one of the things that causes it is,
and this is why your sense of self sort 

350
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:03,920
of disappears in flow and why time 
passes strangely,

351
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:04,754
is your prefrontal Cortex,
the part of your brain that right back 

352
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:08,840
here that governs most of your higher 
cognitive functions,

353
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,640
executive functions,
sense of morality since,

354
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,050
uh,
will complex planning,

355
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:13,280
long term decision making,
blah,

356
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:14,060
blah,
blah.

357
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,040
Turns off,
inflow shuts down.

358
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,330
That portion of the brain shuts down.
Transient meaning temporary hypo.

359
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,730
Hypo is the opposite of hyper.
H.

360
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,880
Ypo means to slow down,
to shut down in front prefrontal Cortex,

361
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,760
a transient hypofrontality when you 
exercise,

362
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,740
right?
You've low grade physical exercise,

363
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:32,030
you're walking,
going for a hike,

364
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,530
25 minutes.
And you know this feeling,

365
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:35,030
you're brain gets quiet,
right?

366
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,223
Everything starts to sit down.
That's exercise induced transient 

367
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,504
hypofrontality.
So you can sort of walk yourself into a 

368
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,360
low grade flow state.
So it's really,

369
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:44,194
it's a great reset if you've been doing 
something creative and you didn't get 

370
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:47,024
into flow and it was frustrating.
This is a way to sort of reset your 

371
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,174
brain and start over and if you did get 
into flow and as a really vibrant 

372
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,154
writing session,
here's another way to chill it out and 

373
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,063
start over.

374
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,470
Now this area of the brain that quiets 
down because you're.

375
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:06,330
You're no longer second guessing 
yourself.

376
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:09,150
You no longer thinking about the,
you know,

377
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,070
whether this is the right thing to do or
that,

378
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,920
that does that have to,
does that have,

379
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,700
do you have to be doing something that 
you've done many,

380
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,534
many times?
We've carved these sorts of paths of 

381
00:16:20,221 --> 00:16:21,054
recognition,
like say like if you were a guy who is 

382
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:24,324
really into running and you run all the 
time and like this is like once you 

383
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,310
start running is your body's like,
hey,

384
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,680
we run and this is what we did.
We already know how to do this.

385
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,040
And so then you can get into that sort 
of strange flow state.

386
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,113
Is that what it is?

387
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,430
So there's a couple of different answers
to that and probably the truthful answer

388
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:44,560
is we're not 100 percent certain,
but here's what we know.

389
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,590
Usually flow is what happens when you've
let.

390
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,640
You've automatized a whole bunch of 
skills,

391
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,533
right?
And they come together for the first 

392
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:54,860
time.
Automatize means you've just passed them

393
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,490
to your conscious mind,
your subconscious,

394
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:58,860
so you now know how to do them,
right?

395
00:16:58,861 --> 00:16:59,694
You no longer learning the skills.
Usually what happens with flow is when 

396
00:17:01,801 --> 00:17:05,280
you take like three or four of those 
automized skills and bring them together

397
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:07,800
for the first time and everything sort 
of levels up.

398
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,023
So that's typically how it happens.
But you see things with like action 

399
00:17:11,851 --> 00:17:12,301
sports,
right?

400
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:13,134
People go snowboarding for the first 
time and you know the first couple of 

401
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:17,160
hours where they don't know what they're
doing.

402
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,960
It's awful.
They're falling all over the place,

403
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,003
but by the end of the day,
because snowboarding's a fairly easy 

404
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:22,644
sport to get down,
like the first time you can actually 

405
00:17:24,601 --> 00:17:26,700
start gliding down the mountain.
By the end of the day,

406
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,150
you'll see people get into flow that you
know and they'll have these really deep,

407
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:30,984
powerful flow states.
One of the reasons is because risk is a 

408
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:36,030
flow trigger risk spikes dumpmen in the 
brain which drives focus,

409
00:17:36,031 --> 00:17:39,600
which helps kick you into flow.
One of the things that'll get you there.

410
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,790
And so that shows up with the 
snowboarding with the action sports.

411
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,624
So I think there are certain things that
you can get into flow along the way 

412
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,160
earlier on,
but as general rule,

413
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,280
it's skills that you've already 
automatized and you're really,

414
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,450
really good at.
Yeah,

415
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:56,310
that's why I was asking because,
um,

416
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:59,040
I've achieved those states,
um,

417
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,870
with uh,
like playing pool.

418
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,650
It's called being in stroke or being a 
dead stroke.

419
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,890
And when you get,
when you play pool,

420
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:10,050
especially if you play for hours and 
hours at a time,

421
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,840
you get to this place and sometimes it 
doesn't last.

422
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,970
Sometimes it only lasts for a few games 
at a time.

423
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,133
But you get to this place where you can 
put that ball exactly where you wanted 

424
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,903
to go.
And you know exactly where the ball's 

425
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,203
going to reflect off that ball and 
bounce to the next rail and being in a 

426
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:29,010
perfect position on the next ball and 
you get into this flow,

427
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:32,160
this dead stroke stage,
and when you're there,

428
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,540
you're almost like a partition or almost
like rather a passenger.

429
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,270
You're almost sitting back and watching 
this play out.

430
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,510
And the key to maintaining that state is
to never recognize the state.

431
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:47,100
Never acknowledged the state,
never go,

432
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:49,050
Holy Shit,
I'm in dead punch right now.

433
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,003
Because if you do that,
then you'll start thinking and then 

434
00:18:51,451 --> 00:18:53,550
you'll start.
You'll bring your prefrontal cortex back

435
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:56,070
online and it'll kick you out of that 
state.

436
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,360
Exactly.
So let me ask you a question.

437
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,253
You were talking earlier and you're 
talking about fighting and how 

438
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,760
everything fits together in that moment.
Did you find more flow as a fighter,

439
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:07,980
as a comic?
Will the explain to people?

440
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:08,814
What we were talking about,
we're talking about is that I'm 

441
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,053
preparing for an martial.
Arts in general can be very psychedelic 

442
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,823
because there's such an intense 
introspective aspect to training where 

443
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,534
you have to examine your skills so 
closely and you have to be so acutely 

444
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:25,614
aware of your strengths and weaknesses 
and you cannot have any delusion about 

445
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:28,644
it because once the moment funnels down,
all this pressure builds to this one 

446
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,650
event where you have to actually 
compete.

447
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,040
That event is if you do not have all 
your ducks in a row,

448
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,874
if you have not examined all aspects and
prepared for all aspects of this 

449
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:45,840
competition,
like 100 percent honest,

450
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,900
you're gonna fuck up and you're going to
be scared and you're going to be nervous

451
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,420
and you're going to be nervous anyway,
but you're going to really be nervous if

452
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:53,940
you haven't done your work.
So it'd be you.

453
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,740
There's a selflessness that gets sort of
exposed when you're doing that.

454
00:19:58,741 --> 00:20:01,250
Not Selflessness rather,
but the,

455
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,173
you step outside of yourself to examine 
yourself almost as if you're looking at 

456
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,570
yourself as a mathematical program 
rather than as a person.

457
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,840
Um,
and then when you're,

458
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,840
when you're fighting and all and it's,
if it's going well,

459
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,950
which is,
you know,

460
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,650
not always happening,
but if it is going well,

461
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,620
sometimes things happen.
Like sometimes you'll hit people and you

462
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,080
had no idea how you did it,
like you,

463
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,110
like you're so it's so programmed in you
that you have to figure out how to quiet

464
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,060
everything down and just react.

465
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,740
But that only happens through intense 
training for so long that you have these

466
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:41,880
pathways carved.
Like you'll see it in a fight with floyd

467
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:42,714
mayweather is a great example.
Someone will throw a punch at him and 

468
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:48,640
you will literally see his eyes open as 
the glove comes to his face.

469
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,380
He moves just out of the way and it 
counters any counter so quickly.

470
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:55,990
There's no way he could have thought of.
He's not even thinking.

471
00:20:55,991 --> 00:20:59,500
It's just he's his patterns recognize,
oh,

472
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:00,334
there's this and then that comes after 
this and there's not even a thought 

473
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:04,870
process behind it.
He just does.

474
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,950
He just flows with it.
It's when you can be,

475
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:13,150
when you have actual space to be 
creative inside that are right,

476
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,090
when it's not,
when you're just not reacting in a fight

477
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:17,290
and whatever.
When you actually,

478
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,770
you know when,
when the flow is peaking,

479
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,623
you really can make any decision you 
want to and it doesn't actually feel 

480
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:23,540
like you're.

481
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,490
You're making this decision,
feels like you're,

482
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,490
you're watching somebody else make that 
decision.

483
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:30,340
You're a passenger.
And the way I described finding,

484
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:35,341
I say fighting is extreme problem 
solving with dire physical consequences.

485
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,830
That's what it is.
That's,

486
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,500
I mean,
that's why I like action sports as well.

487
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,620
It's the same thing.
Yeah.

488
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,640
When you see someone doing like 15 flips
with a bmx bike,

489
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,770
Ooh,
if you don't land on your tires,

490
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:49,090
you got a real problem there,
Fella.

491
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,303
Yeah.
There's something superintendent to it 

492
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,080
now in fighting add on that.
It's not just the air and the ground,

493
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,153
but another person who's just like you 
just as trained as you and is trying to 

494
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,340
do to you what you're trying to do to 
them.

495
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:06,340
So you're solving this puzzle that's 
alive,

496
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,060
human being with all these preprogrammed
variables that they have.

497
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,883
So your question was like,
where do you experience the flow state 

498
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:14,920
more fighting or comedy?

499
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,753
I think probably comedy.
It's easier because there's not as many 

500
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:22,750
consequences and you also,
you develop a routine or like you'll um,

501
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,840
the way I do it and a lot of guys do it 
the same way.

502
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,003
You put together a special and then you 
film it and then you abandoned it and 

503
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:35,410
then you start from scratch.
So that I just did one and it just aired

504
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,053
October 21st.
So now I'm in this like new material 

505
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:42,170
acquisition mode which takes,
uh,

506
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,083
takes a while.
So there's very little flow going on 

507
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:46,024
while I'm on stage.
It's a lot of its calculation and 

508
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:49,600
thinking and remembering all the new 
stuff.

509
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,830
But then after a few months of that,
then you get to this point where,

510
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,683
Oh,
I know that bit and then there's this 

511
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:56,584
bit and this.
And then you get into this comfortable 

512
00:22:57,581 --> 00:22:59,770
zone and then it starts to flow again.

513
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,840
And then you just got to figure out,
okay,

514
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,033
this is what we got,
like an hour and 20 minutes of this 

515
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:05,224
here,
let this simmer this down to 60 bad ass 

516
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:09,700
minutes and wrap it up.
And then I start all over again.

517
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,670
It's usually like a two year,
two year presses.

518
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,880
Yeah,
two year cycle.

519
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,240
Do you know when you're developing a 
good bit?

520
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,883
Sometimes.
Sometimes you think it's good and it 

521
00:23:19,061 --> 00:23:19,894
sucks.
Sometimes you think it sucks and it 

522
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:23,200
turns out to be your best one.
You know?

523
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,034
And sometimes you're onstage and then in
the moment a new idea pops in your head 

524
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:29,830
that makes it way better than it was 
before.

525
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:30,783
And it's one of the only art forms I 
think we have to do it in front of a 

526
00:23:33,341 --> 00:23:35,860
crowd to develop it.
He like,

527
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:38,800
you could write the dopest song ever by 
herself.

528
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:39,903
You know,
there's a lot of people that have wrote 

529
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:41,494
some written,
some amazing songs and there was no one 

530
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:46,040
in the room and they wrote it and they 
programmed the music and

531
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,431
then go,
hey,

532
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:47,870
check this out.
There's a song I wrote and you're like,

533
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,580
Holy Shit,
this is incredible.

534
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,450
They didn't need anybody for that.
They came up with it in,

535
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:58,000
in like in their own personal head and 
sat down with comedy.

536
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,560
You kind kinda have to have an audience.
You have the idea,

537
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,753
you write things out,
but it doesn't really come fully 

538
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:04,360
together,
doesn't.

539
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,193
It?
Doesn't cure unless the audience is 

540
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,560
there,
if that makes sense.

541
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,413
That totally makes sense.
Different kinds of jokes for different 

542
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:13,370
audiences as well.
I'm sure.

543
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:14,690
Sort of.
Yeah,

544
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:17,990
but you can't see those people change.
You can't worry about them.

545
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,020
You know,
you're,

546
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,853
you're got to do things that you think 
are funny because the problem with 

547
00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:24,410
comedy also is that there's only one 
genre,

548
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,580
but there's not,
there's many,

549
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:27,330
many genres of comedy.
Like,

550
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:28,670
you know,
comedy is comedy,

551
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,990
but who the fuck goes to see live music,
you know,

552
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,943
and you go to see live music.
It's Johnny Cash fall by the Wu Tang 

553
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:36,710
clan.
That doesn't make any sense.

554
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,900
You know,
you would go see rap,

555
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,820
you'd go to see country,
you go see rock.

556
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,390
You would likely go to see the kind of 
music that you're really into,

557
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,703
whereas comedies,
just one universal generic term for a 

558
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:49,940
bunch of

559
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,020
go see Steven,
right.

560
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,290
Followed by Dave Chappelle or radically

561
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:54,261
I would.
Yeah,

562
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,094
sure.
Yeah.

563
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,370
But some people like only squeaky clean,
like Brian Regan type comedy and if they

564
00:25:01,971 --> 00:25:04,430
went to see doug,
Stan hope they would leave and disgust,

565
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,923
you know?
Yeah.

566
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,190
That makes sense.
Yeah.

567
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,170
It's interesting.
Yeah.

568
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:12,320
Well it's weird because there is,
I mean there's a bunch of different ways

569
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:13,940
to do it,
but it only has one name,

570
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,980
you know,
where it's like,

571
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:16,491
you know,
he said,

572
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:17,930
well,
and what kind of music do you do?

573
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,123
Just,
you know,

574
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,510
so we need new names.
I mean,

575
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:22,600
it's no problem.
No,

576
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,020
no,
it's fine.

577
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
You're the one who started it,
man,

578
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,200
tried to back you up.
Just thinking about it too much.

579
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,240
Overthinking,
overthinking a I think is a,

580
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,670
that's.
You've talked about that many times with

581
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:38,504
flow state,
that the second guessing and that part 

582
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:42,104
of your mind,
that doubts is really the enemy of that 

583
00:25:44,121 --> 00:25:44,890
state.

584
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,910
It's twofold.
One,

585
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,590
you're activating your prefrontal 
Cortex,

586
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:48,424
right?
The party of brand that's doing that 

587
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:51,880
overthinking and whenever you get 
stressed,

588
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,980
obviously the brand starts releasing 
cortisol.

589
00:25:53,981 --> 00:25:55,590
Norepinephrine,
your stress hormones,

590
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:58,240
right?
There's so flow exists.

591
00:25:58,241 --> 00:26:00,730
One flow exists,
they call it the flow channel,

592
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,743
and the idea basically is that one of 
the easiest ways to trigger flow is to 

593
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,390
is what's called the challenge skills 
balance,

594
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,523
so flow shows up best when the challenge
of the task at hand slightly exceeds 

595
00:26:13,421 --> 00:26:14,254
your skillset,
so you want to stretch but not snap and 

596
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:19,030
there's nothing fancy or flow follows 
focus,

597
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,660
so everything that triggers flow is a 
way of driving intention.

598
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,523
The present moment.
So if I was to what this emotionally I 

599
00:26:26,441 --> 00:26:31,180
would say flow exists sort of not on but
near the midpoint between boredom.

600
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,500
Hey,
there's not enough stimulation here.

601
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:34,360
I'm not paying any attention and 
anxiety.

602
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:36,040
Whoa,
way too much stimulation.

603
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm overburdened that anxiety,
norepinephrine and cortisol.

604
00:26:39,701 --> 00:26:40,534
You get up in your head,
you're producing norepinephrine and 

605
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,280
cortisol.
You're knocking yourself

606
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:49,310
out of that sweet spot and why does 
norepinephrine knock you out of it?

607
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:54,030
Isn't that like a like one of those feel
good hormones?

608
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,650
It.
It can be as well.

609
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,200
It can be a feel good.
It's essentially right.

610
00:26:58,201 --> 00:27:03,201
It's the internal indogenous version of 
speed with the external substances.

611
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:06,600
Same chemical.
Basically a little bit.

612
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:09,060
Wakes you up,
drives focus too much.

613
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,820
You're jittery and freaking out.
Okay.

614
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,170
That makes sense.
And there's got to be a spectrum as well

615
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,370
to the toes date,
right?

616
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:20,480
So a bunch of different ones.
But a check sent me jaime high chicks at

617
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:20,851
me.
Hi.

618
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:23,720
Who's sort of the godfather of flow 
psychology was that he says his name.

619
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,460
Mihai chick sent me.
Hi.

620
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,110
That's his whole name.
That's how you.

621
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:28,561
That?
Yeah,

622
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:29,850
he's Hungarian.
That's high.

623
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,150
Chicks set me.
Hi Me hot chicks sent me high and by the

624
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,650
way,
funny story about how I.

625
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,513
So I was on NPR after my second book,
which was the first time I wrote about 

626
00:27:38,131 --> 00:27:42,210
him and I slaughtered his name.
I mean just slaughtered,

627
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,280
destroyed it.
And the phone rings.

628
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:45,750
It was live.
I think it was in Cleveland.

629
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:48,050
I think that's where I was.
And the color comes,

630
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,610
gets on like how can we help you?
What can you do?

631
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,250
Tell them moron sitting next to you.
It's me.

632
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,710
Hi.
Chick sent me hi.

633
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,320
Chick sent me high and he did like four 
times.

634
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:59,010
We're out.
I was like,

635
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,210
okay,
I've been schooled.

636
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:01,044
I got it.

637
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,710
I was kind of a moron.
Oh boy.

638
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:05,544
You really?
Or that guy just looking to get some 

639
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:09,600
fucking Brownie points because he knew 
the name.

640
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,070
Okay,
so that too.

641
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,110
Yeah,
I think that guy's an asshole.

642
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,020
Don't moron.
Moron.

643
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,023
Because you don't know the craziest 
fucking name than anybody's ever put on 

644
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:21,630
a kid.
It's true.

645
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,850
That isn't a poor kid in school.
Me,

646
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:25,140
hi.
Chuck sent me hide.

647
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:26,490
The whole class was like,
what?

648
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,130
Where did we,
how did we even get to him?

649
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,233
A flow state spectrum spectrum.
So a check sent me high up in the 

650
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:36,241
seventies,
sixties,

651
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:38,730
seventies and eighties.
Discovered a bunch of things about flow.

652
00:28:38,731 --> 00:28:39,564
That kind of fundamental.
First thing he discovered is that 

653
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:42,624
there's.
He came up with 10 characteristics that 

654
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:45,534
define the state.
I think he actually sort of mashed up 

655
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:49,590
three triggers with seven 
characteristics,

656
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:53,190
but these are things like uninterrupted 
concentration,

657
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,820
your sense of self vanishing time 
passing strangely.

658
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,350
Uh,
and the reason,

659
00:28:58,351 --> 00:29:00,240
by the way this happens,
why does self vanished?

660
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:01,590
But as time pass,
so strangely,

661
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:05,820
inflow self and time are both 
calculations performed in the prefrontal

662
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,470
cortex.
So for example,

663
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:09,780
time is calculated all over the 
prefrontal cortex.

664
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,580
This is David Eagleman is work from 
Stanford,

665
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,653
used to be at Baylor,
and when parts of the brain start to 

666
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:17,040
wink out,
when part of the prefrontal cortex start

667
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,710
to shut down,
as you move into flow,

668
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,753
your brain can no longer perform the 
calculation so you can no longer 

669
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:23,634
separate past from present future and 
you're plunged into a deep now are 

670
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,753
internal present.
So that's some of where that comes from 

671
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,920
is the deactivation of the prefrontal 
cortex.

672
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,173
But anyways,
he figured out there were these seven 

673
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,304
characteristics of flow and there's 
micro flow states when a couple of them 

674
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:39,114
show up.
So like you're at work and you're 

675
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:41,990
talking to,
you

676
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,690
know,
you bump into a colleague in the hallway

677
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:46,450
and you fall into a conversation,
gets sucks.

678
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,490
You in an hour goes by and you don't 
notice.

679
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,960
That's microflow macro flow.
When all the conditions show up at once.

680
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,990
For the first 70 years we were looking 
at the experience people thought we were

681
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:58,150
looking at a full blown mystical 
experience.

682
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,460
They didn't know what it was because 
everything can happen.

683
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:03,490
You can have out of body experiences,
you can have really strange,

684
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,520
you know,
phenomena as a consciousness show up.

685
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,443
So macro,
micro flow to macro flow and it's a 

686
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:12,490
spectrum experience.
It's one of those words are one of those

687
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:13,660
terms rather flow

688
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,050
state where there's a lot of woo 
attached to that sort of state.

689
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:19,840
Like a lot of people almost want to call
bullshit automatically.

690
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,770
Like,
Oh,

691
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,210
you're in a flow state.

692
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,281
They stayed there.
Well,

693
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:24,530
there's reasons for that.
And then,

694
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,820
so the flow genome project,
which is my organization,

695
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,760
our whole goal when I started with my 
partner,

696
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,594
Jamie wheal,
was to grab flow back from the new age 

697
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,090
and put it on a hard science footing and
sort of what happened.

698
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:37,410
There were a number of things that 
happened,

699
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,244
but,
uh,

700
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,830
who do I kill?
Which is actually a woman's name,

701
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,500
another person with a crazy name.
H U,

702
00:30:43,501 --> 00:30:46,950
D A,
I think it's a k I l she was the world's

703
00:30:46,951 --> 00:30:47,784
leading endorphin expert.
She's with the University of Michigan 

704
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:50,843
and she was president,
the American Society for neuroscience 

705
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,530
and back in,
I want to say 99 or 2000.

706
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,960
Gina Kolata was a science writer for the
New York Times,

707
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,350
asked,
uh,

708
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,233
who do I kill about endorphins,
which everybody had thought were one of 

709
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,324
the reasons,
one of the things that causes flow and 

710
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,070
they were having a really hard time 
measuring endorphins in the brain.

711
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,900
So there's that kill said,
told the New York Times,

712
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,880
this is a total fantasy of the pop 
culture.

713
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:15,060
It's bullshit doesn't exist.
She was totally wrong,

714
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,110
but it wasn't until 2007,
2008 that are technology got good enough

715
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,300
to actually visualize the endorphins in 
the brain.

716
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,373
But at that moment,
flow research in America kept going in 

717
00:31:24,871 --> 00:31:27,750
Europe and other places in America 
basically it went to a dead stop.

718
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:31,470
Nobody else was gonna fund it and I 
think the new age came in and went,

719
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,820
oh,
flow.

720
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,120
It's such a great term working.
And that's what happened.

721
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,313
So a lot of,
a lot of what I tried to do at the flow 

722
00:31:39,421 --> 00:31:43,920
genome project and what we've tried to 
do is just put it back on a hard science

723
00:31:43,921 --> 00:31:44,754
footing because there's 150 years of 
science behind flow flow science dates 

724
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:48,564
back almost to the 18 seventies to 
almost the beginning of cognitive 

725
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:54,930
neuroscience and cognitive psychology.
The research goes all the way back.

726
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:58,200
William James was looking at this stuff 
at Harvard and the turn of the century.

727
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,070
There's a 100 years of research.
I mean ultimate human performance,

728
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,110
optimal performance.
Of course we want to study it.

729
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,630
No,
it's funny because skeptical people will

730
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:07,464
rally against it in a weird way.
Like I had a conversation with Sam 

731
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,853
Harris about it.
We were saying that when you look at it 

732
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:14,550
statistically,
when people are in the zone,

733
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,570
they are not more accurate in basketball
than they are outside of it.

734
00:32:18,571 --> 00:32:21,540
That it's an anomaly and then it's a.
it's an illusion.

735
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:24,690
It's an illusion of the state of mind 
where you're achieving this.

736
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:26,460
And I was like,
I don't know what you're talking about,

737
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,140
man.
I just don't know how.

738
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:30,480
First of all,
how often that's been measured where you

739
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:32,990
can say this because he was really 
adamant about it.

740
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,133
It sounds like a super hyper skeptic.
Sam's talking specifically about streak 

741
00:32:38,431 --> 00:32:39,020
shooting,
right?

742
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,970
That's what they're looking at.

743
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,500
Yes.
And which is a funny and he's right.

744
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:44,510
His,
his dad is absolutely correct.

745
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,460
Let me give you,
just give you a counterpoint from my own

746
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:47,690
life.
So I have a book,

747
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,150
my third book called a small furry 
prayer,

748
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,223
uh,
which is about the relationship between 

749
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:52,874
humans and animals and sort of on the 
work that I do with dogs and my wife 

750
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:58,560
does with dogs.
And I wrote the first half of them.

751
00:32:58,561 --> 00:33:01,450
It's been a 300 page book.
I wrote the first half of the fourth.

752
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,660
The whole thing turned it in and my 
agent called me up and she said,

753
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,400
or my editor called me up and she said,
look,

754
00:33:07,401 --> 00:33:09,170
the first hundred and 10 pages are 
pretty good.

755
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:10,004
You got to Redo it.
But like everything from that point on 

756
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:13,130
sucks,
I need you to rewrite it.

757
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,503
And she was totally right.
So I sat down to rewrite it and I sort 

758
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:21,830
of polished the first hundred and 10 
pages and couldn't,

759
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:23,060
got stuck,
couldn't write,

760
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:25,400
couldn't write months,
go by closing,

761
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:27,350
and my deadline,
I go downhill,

762
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:28,184
mountain biking the very first time in 
my life and it just kicks me into this 

763
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,270
down if you know how to ride a bike,
you can get downhill,

764
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,790
might have found biking pretty quickly.

765
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,033
Um,
and it just kicked me into an amazingly 

766
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:37,874
deep flow state.
I went home and I started writing and I 

767
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:42,050
didn't stop for about two weeks 
straight.

768
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,050
I went to sleep and things like that,
but it was a nonstop flow state.

769
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,980
Finished the book,
wrote 160 pages in like two weeks,

770
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:49,814
which is incredible and bizarre.
And talk about feeling like a passenger 

771
00:33:52,401 --> 00:33:55,520
earlier.
I have no idea who wrote the second half

772
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:56,650
of that book.
No idea,

773
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,430
just flowed out of me,
pardon the Pun.

774
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,653
But when I turned it in,
my editor came back to me and they had 

775
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:05,270
the first hundred and 10 pages.
The part I had written outside of flow,

776
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,104
there were still lots of errors and can 
change this and fix this and this from 

777
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:10,400
page one,
10 to the end of the book,

778
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:11,623
not one change.
She was happy with everything I'd 

779
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,600
written.

780
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,790
Book was a bestseller,
is nominated for a Pulitzer prize.

781
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,920
So obviously I did something right along
the way.

782
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,240
Second half happened totally in flow,
you know,

783
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,700
that's the counter to Samsung argument.
What was the subject of this like?

784
00:34:25,701 --> 00:34:28,130
Well that's interesting,
but what was the subject to the,

785
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:28,964
uh,
of the second half of the whole book is 

786
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,790
about the relationship between humans 
and animals and about animal welfare and

787
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,820
running a dog sanctuary and in where 
empathy and altruism comes from and what

788
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,870
it has to do with evolution.
Things along those lines.

789
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,203
Uh,
the second half had a lot to do with 

790
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:48,350
sort of a little bit to do with animals 
and spirituality and why we have this.

791
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,710
What is that,
you know,

792
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,713
non we.
What do we mean by like the spiritual 

793
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:53,534
relationship to nature.
If you strip out the woo what's 

794
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,700
underneath that now?
When you were on the bike,

795
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,340
do you remember the thought?
Do you remember what it was?

796
00:35:01,341 --> 00:35:02,420
What the catalyst was?

797
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,323
The catalyst was Bob Dylan's going to 
occupy local this song and it wasn't 

798
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:12,080
even his.
It was a,

799
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,333
I don't remember the movie that where 
they did all the Bob Dylan songs over 

800
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:20,240
again a couple years ago and was so 
somebody's version of that and something

801
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:22,430
about the first couple lines to that 
song.

802
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,670
It got the tone right.
It was like the.

803
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,673
There was something really kind of 
bittersweet and raw in that song that I 

804
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:31,430
needed in my book and that's what it 
was.

805
00:35:31,431 --> 00:35:32,264
Somehow I came home with the salt,
with that lyric in my head and I just 

806
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,350
started writing and that's what it was.
Why?

807
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,420
By the way,
that's probably the.

808
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,780
You happen to pick the one thing where I
could have given you the cause.

809
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:43,614
Any other book.
I'm probably going to whiff on that 

810
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:46,800
question,
but that's the one I remember.

811
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,163
Is there

812
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,143
weird how certain songs will trigger 
like some sort of inspirational 

813
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,410
creativity inside of you?
And I've always wondered what that is.

814
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,373
I,
I learned this from Hunter Thompson and 

815
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:00,364
I've done it many times myself where 
I'll take a song and I'll put it on 

816
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:06,830
replay replay and the same song.
Like I flew from the south.

817
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,900
I'm from San Francisco to New York once 
and the entire flight actually la,

818
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,553
La and New York.
The entire flight I listened to Ozzy 

819
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,073
Osborne,
crazy train the entire flight while I 

820
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:19,314
was writing.

821
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,183
Just I just kept playing it over and 
over and over again and do it with a 

822
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,514
fixed playlist.
I usually pick about seven to 10 songs 

823
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:29,280
and for her book and I usually.
It's usually two different playlists for

824
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,114
the first half of the book will be one 
playlist and then they'll start to fail 

825
00:36:32,641 --> 00:36:33,474
and I can sort of feel like the Jews to 
go on and I'll have to find a whole 

826
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:41,190
bunch to the woo woo magic.
Yeah.

827
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:41,950
There's something

828
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,783
about songs to where sometimes I'm 
listening to music when I'm writing and 

829
00:36:45,071 --> 00:36:47,380
I'm like,
I'm listening to this music too much.

830
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,260
I can't pay attention to what I'm doing 
and I've got to shut it off.

831
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,390
And then I can get,
uh,

832
00:36:52,391 --> 00:36:55,130
get into a state sometimes where I'm not
even hearing the words,

833
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,180
like the music is almost just like,
like a,

834
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,800
like a fuel or something or like a,
a,

835
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,500
like some sort of a motivating factor 
that's not really totally taking in.

836
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,020
Like I'm aware of it,
but I'm not addressing it.

837
00:37:08,021 --> 00:37:08,854
I'm not really focusing on the lyrics.
I'm just sorta like riding the head dod 

838
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:16,150
and the beat is kind of driving me in 
some sort of a weird way.

839
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,380
Also find my latest book stealing fire.
The one that's out in February,

840
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,840
most of the writing that I had a 
partner.

841
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,480
So he did something,
something.

842
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,960
But most of that book was written to 
Amanda Palmer's cover of Nick Cave's the

843
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:32,330
ship song over and over and over again.
I know.

844
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,060
I don't know who Amanda Palmer is.
I don't know who nick cave is either.

845
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,020
My,
a bad person.

846
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,480
I was at work.
I don't think you're a bad person.

847
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,270
Who is Amanda Palmer?
Uh,

848
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,620
no.
She uh,

849
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,670
married to Neil Gaiman,
the writer.

850
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,140
I know that guy is seen him on twitter.
Amanda's on twitter too.

851
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,300
She's just a singer,
songwriter,

852
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,600
psychoactive substances or anything that
people do that could enhance creativity.

853
00:38:00,841 --> 00:38:01,674
Is there like a proven thing that Keith 
or enhanced flow state or enhanced 

854
00:38:05,101 --> 00:38:05,934
creativity?

855
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:09,980
So there's a couple different ways to 
answer this question.

856
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,980
Um,
for sure.

857
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,300
So neurobiologically we know for 
example,

858
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,610
so let's.
First of all,

859
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:21,790
creative is a really fricking fuzzy 
words,

860
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:22,624
so let's,
let's put some meat around it for 

861
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:24,884
starters.
There are lots of different styles of 

862
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:28,640
creativity,
types of creativity,

863
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:29,391
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

864
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:33,530
but usually not 100 percent,
but usually what you're talking about is

865
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:36,400
the brain taking in more or different

866
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,233
information per second.
And then finding connections between 

867
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:43,180
this new incoming information and older 
ideas.

868
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,670
Right?
So you've got information acquisition on

869
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:46,504
the front end and you've got pattern 
recognition which is closely related 

870
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,134
ideas,
finding connections with lateral 

871
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:54,340
thinking,
which is far flung ideas.

872
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,580
And then on the back end,
usually you have to.

873
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,830
Creativity involves making it public,
right?

874
00:38:59,831 --> 00:39:00,664
You gotta have some courage and some 
bravery on the back and we got to take 

875
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:06,070
it out into the world.
So to me,

876
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:08,500
when we talk about creativity,
that's the process.

877
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:10,840
So if you want to tell you about 
amplifying creativity,

878
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,920
will you have a bunch of different 
places you can intercept in the chain?

879
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:15,754
Right?
So when we have norepinephrine and 

880
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,590
dopamine in our system,
so it internally,

881
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,410
we get nor up effort and dopamine,
they're focusing chemicals.

882
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,770
Dope means shows up whenever we link 
patterns together also.

883
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,603
So you've done a crossword puzzle,
you don't get an answer to that little 

884
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,240
rush of pleasure,
that's dopamine,

885
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,010
I'm more norepinephrine and dopamine.
Not only do you take in more information

886
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:41,250
per second when they're in your system,
you also,

887
00:39:41,251 --> 00:39:42,084
they also amplify pattern recognition.
They lower signal to noise ratios is 

888
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:46,354
what they do.
So we notice more patterns and mine 

889
00:39:48,671 --> 00:39:50,890
which is the psychoactive inside of 
marijuana,

890
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,780
amplifies lateral thinking,
long distance connections,

891
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:56,614
right?
And then there's a bunch of different 

892
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,800
chemicals that will show up and help you
take risks.

893
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:00,903
All these chemicals can produce,
can be produced internally or dodge if 

894
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:06,490
you want.
Like I always say,

895
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,710
I'm not,
you know,

896
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,233
only you,
I guess there are more states you can 

897
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:14,500
now do this in.
But a really cheap flow hack is an won't

898
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,230
work over time,
but if you go for a 20 minute,

899
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,330
25 minute run,
low grade Ron,

900
00:40:19,331 --> 00:40:21,730
you're inducing exercise induced 
transient hypofrontality,

901
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:24,070
we talked about that,
followed by a cup of coffee,

902
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,073
followed by a joint and you're going to 
essentially mimic the majority of the 

903
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:31,840
neurochemistry that shows up in a flow 
state.

904
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,320
So it's an artificial flow state.
So you can,

905
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,820
you can do it that way.
You can do it with a,

906
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,440
you know,
go for a run and you know,

907
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:39,274
do it that way.
I can do the same thing if you go for 

908
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,290
I'll do something and I do this,
my dogs,

909
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:45,124
the dog sanctuary,
I want to put them in flow because all 

910
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:47,134
these same neurochemicals boost your 
immune system and reset your nervous 

911
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:52,030
system a little bit.
So we work with very,

912
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:55,400
very sick animals and so flow is really 
beneficial.

913
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,234
That really extend pet lifespan.
We've discovered we do this thing where 

914
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:00,034
we'll hike for like half an hour or so 
again to get to the point where low 

915
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:04,114
grade exercise induced just handwritten 
hypofrontality and then we will sprint 

916
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:07,923
up a cliff or up a hill,
something like a five to seven minutes 

917
00:41:10,771 --> 00:41:13,840
sprint just long enough to get the 
endorphins going.

918
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,490
Right?
So you get that pain relief.

919
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,950
You sort of know you've gotten there 
when you get in the pain relief,

920
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:18,784
so the cycle gets you sort of end to the
low grade flow state and then you're 

921
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:23,224
going to add endorphins in by pushing 
yourself physically for like five to 

922
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:28,810
seven minutes and then I turn around 
from the top of the cliff and I run back

923
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:29,644
down the cliff face,
which is a big risk and gets a bunch of 

924
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:35,120
dopamine into your system.
And usually by the time I hit the bottom

925
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:36,980
of that cliff,
I'm in a flow state.

926
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:40,970
So like if I'm trying to solve a puzzle,
a writing puzzle and I can't solve it,

927
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,470
I will get.
I call it a flow hike.

928
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:43,304
I won't go out and do this exact format.
And usually by the time mom hiking home 

929
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,910
with the dogs,
the answers are starting to come.

930
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,343
Hello.

931
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,543
Now we.
I think we'd be remiss if we didn't go 

932
00:41:54,531 --> 00:41:58,640
back to what Sam was talking about where
he was talking about his streak shooting

933
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,980
and comparing streaks to shooting just 
flow state,

934
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,530
which I think is kind of very different,
right?

935
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:07,160
Because street shooting has some pretty 
definitive results.

936
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,940
If you,
if it's very repeatable or you're,

937
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,720
you're doing the same thing over and 
over again.

938
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,170
He's shooting a ball into a net and it's
not an easy thing to do.

939
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,200
And statistically when someone's in a 
flow state,

940
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,190
they're not more successful or

941
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,370
they think is a flow state or in the 
zone.

942
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,010
That's the thing that I was going to 
point out and I like,

943
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,253
you know,
I've seen that same data and I have a 

944
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:29,204
hard time believing it.
Like it doesn't actually make a whole 

945
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:32,990
lot of sense to me.
It's not anomalous finding.

946
00:42:32,991 --> 00:42:35,390
It's interesting for that reason.
We know people go on streaks,

947
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,224
right?
I just want what I like when I talk 

948
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:38,570
about flow.
Right.

949
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,733
Everybody's got what I mean we can.
It's defined as an optimal state of 

950
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:44,060
consciousness where we feel our best and
perform our best.

951
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,590
There's more words we can layer under 
it,

952
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:49,550
but what I'm talking about specifically 
is specific changes in brain function.

953
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:52,100
You're getting prefrontal cortex is 
turning down.

954
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:52,934
You're getting five or six 
neurochemicals that tend to show up in 

955
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:55,934
your brainwaves,
dropped down to the Alpha Theta 

956
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,220
borderline.

957
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,950
So when somebody tells me they're in the
zone,

958
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,290
we don't have a biophysical based flow 
detector yet.

959
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:08,000
There's we're working on one.
Adam Gozali at CCSF is working alone,

960
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:10,250
but it doesn't exist yet.
So right now if I want to know if you're

961
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:11,084
in flow,
I have to give you a subjective 

962
00:43:12,111 --> 00:43:14,090
questionnaire is extremely well 
validated.

963
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,060
We've got like 50 years of research 
around it works,

964
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:18,283
but it's still.
There's no way to like look at that and 

965
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:22,860
say okay,
this person is in deep flow or not,

966
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:23,783
so we don't have that way to do it yet.
So I don't don't quite know how we do 

967
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:29,570
this research yet,
but it's something that's interesting.

968
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,530
So

969
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,363
do they know what a flow state is?
You're saying that they don't have the 

970
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:37,520
exact ability to test it,
but would it,

971
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,700
what would they use with the use f MRI 
or some sort of a new technology?

972
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:44,640
People have done it 100 different ways 
and this is stuff I talk about in,

973
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,510
in rise of superman primarily,
but um,

974
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,823
so there's Eg work,
right where they're looking at brain 

975
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,920
waves that sort of goes back to the,
to the sixties.

976
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,793
Um,
and it was at that point they just 

977
00:43:57,081 --> 00:43:57,914
thought it was alpha waves.
So when you're quick primer on 

978
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:03,860
brainwaves,
normal waking consciousness,

979
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:05,590
where are we right now?
Beta?

980
00:44:05,591 --> 00:44:08,570
It's a fast moving wave.
It just means that we're talking,

981
00:44:08,571 --> 00:44:10,880
we're thinking we're engaged.
Alpha,

982
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,400
which is right below that is daydreaming
mode.

983
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,120
It's where you sort of flitting from 
thought to thought without much internal

984
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,210
resistance.
Theta is below that data.

985
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,240
We only tend to drop into in rem sleep 
or say hypnagogic state or which is when

986
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:28,430
you're falling asleep,
right?

987
00:44:28,431 --> 00:44:30,380
That weird state where you're falling 
asleep and you think,

988
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,190
oh,
that looks like a gray elephant.

989
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,023
And then turns into a grey sweater and 
then it turns into a great camry pub a 

990
00:44:36,031 --> 00:44:37,320
lot that's happening.
Goget state,

991
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,750
that's data as a general rule.
Um,

992
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,320
so flow takes place.
They used to think it was just alpha.

993
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:45,810
Now they think it's the borderline 
between Alpha Theta.

994
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,140
But we've gotten very,
very precise with Eg.

995
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,033
Eg was one of these things we thought we
could sort of measure it for a long 

996
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:52,974
time.
But in the past 10 years it's gotten 

997
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:54,930
very,
very robust.

998
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:57,600
We have a pretty good look at,
you know,

999
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,430
what people's brands are doing in flow.
They've also used FMRI.

1000
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,020
The best work.
The cool work is Charles Limb,

1001
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,920
he's at Johns Hopkins and uh,
he's got all kinds of talks.

1002
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:09,310
You can find them online.
Um,

1003
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,110
executive a Ted talk about this work.
He did something really cool he took,

1004
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:13,944
he started with jazz musicians and he 
built a keyboard with no metal in it so 

1005
00:45:17,251 --> 00:45:19,080
they can put it inside the f Mri.

1006
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,250
And then he visualized the difference 
between the brain of a professional jazz

1007
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:24,084
musician playing a standard,
playing the same notes over and over 

1008
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,323
versus improvising in a flow state.
So we got to start to see what the 

1009
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:31,374
differences are.
This work has sort of been extended a 

1010
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:36,540
little bit by a guy named Judd brewer at
Yale.

1011
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,320
He's also worked on this.
Um,

1012
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:39,203
he's looked at flow and meditation.
He's found some slightly different 

1013
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:43,530
things than Charles limb,
but.

1014
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,050
So it's a combination,
but we'll keep really,

1015
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:46,884
really need to know.
It's the neurochemistry that I think is 

1016
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:52,860
going to unlock this puzzle.
And a lot of that stuff takes place deep

1017
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:55,410
in the brain.
It's really our imaging technology isn't

1018
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:56,244
quite there yet.
It's starting to get there and probably 

1019
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:58,970
will be there him,
you know,

1020
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,530
three to four years because this stuff 
is advancing so quickly.

1021
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,420
But we haven't put the whole puzzle 
together.

1022
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:04,254
So for example,
I can tell you these five or six 

1023
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:06,864
neurochemicals show up in flow states.
Can I tell you the order that they show 

1024
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:10,790
up?
Can I tell it?

1025
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,700
Do we know if the order that you drop 
into flow versus how I drop in?

1026
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,260
Are they the same?
Are they the different.

1027
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,510
We have no idea.
That's so fascinating.

1028
00:46:18,511 --> 00:46:19,344
It's almost like we're looking at 
something that's taking place behind a 

1029
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,490
wall and we know what's going on over 
there,

1030
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:25,620
but we just don't know exactly what it 
is.

1031
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,530
I think that's one of the things I've 
often,

1032
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,090
I've discovered about science and I 
just,

1033
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,023
you know,
I sort of learned this the hard way 

1034
00:46:31,861 --> 00:46:32,694
coming up as a science writer is I'm 
always stunned by how much we don't 

1035
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:40,430
know,
like really basic basics.

1036
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,720
A lot of really basic,
simple questions.

1037
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,630
Nobody's even thought to ask them yet 
and it's really,

1038
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:47,700
it's really astounding to me how,
you know,

1039
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:49,980
how little we know,
how much more we need to know,

1040
00:46:49,981 --> 00:46:51,360
but,
but really with stuff that,

1041
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,710
you know,
people speak very,

1042
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:54,750
very learned Lee and authoritatively 
about,

1043
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,040
and you start poking and you're like,
look,

1044
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,850
we don't even know the very basics here.
What are you talking about?

1045
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,950
Yeah.
Like what is consciousness?

1046
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,570
We know if you're conscious one,
right?

1047
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,673
I mean that isn't that the big one.
What separates people from almost 

1048
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:12,900
anything else is that they're aware of 
what's going on and they can communicate

1049
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:15,060
it and they're here.
They're conscious,

1050
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,490
they're.
They're not just conscious,

1051
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:18,683
but they're somehow or another.
I'm imparting my consciousness in your 

1052
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:22,884
head and you're imparting yours into 
mine and I'm bouncing your thoughts 

1053
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:26,400
around and try.
Okay.

1054
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:27,540
I see where he's coming from.
Okay.

1055
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:29,160
I see where he's kind of like,
what,

1056
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,260
where?
Where's

1057
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,290
that coming from?
You talking about theory of mind,

1058
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,383
which is interesting because they're 
starting to believe that a lot of a lot 

1059
00:47:36,681 --> 00:47:37,514
of mammals,
health also have theory of mind is not 

1060
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:39,520
just humans,
right?

1061
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:44,521
The dividing line between like what is 
distinctly human at this point is really

1062
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:45,574
thin.
We've only found a couple of things 

1063
00:47:47,201 --> 00:47:48,034
right now.
Robert Sapolsky at Stanford talks about 

1064
00:47:50,021 --> 00:47:51,190
this a lot.
He's great.

1065
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,460
He thinks the only two things that 
separate humans that lower species can't

1066
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:57,994
do what is distinctly human is our 
ability to delay gratification super 

1067
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:04,630
longterm.
Like we have religion,

1068
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,880
right?
You we're willing to delay gratification

1069
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:08,830
until after I'm dead,
right?

1070
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,870
This life socks and then you're going to
go to heaven.

1071
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:13,050
So we're willing to do that.
And we also have,

1072
00:48:13,051 --> 00:48:13,884
uh,
the ability to synthesize opposing 

1073
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:17,021
ideas,
right?

1074
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:17,854
They can galleon dialectic.
I can take this thing over here on this 

1075
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,034
side,
this thing over here on this and put it 

1076
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:26,350
together and synthesize new ideas,
which most animals don't seem to be able

1077
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:27,040
to do.

1078
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,080
But everything else,
we pretty much found.

1079
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,513
Well,
isn't language one of the big ones 

1080
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,080
because with the law,
I mean I think most animals are,

1081
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,200
even if they're aware and their 
consciousness and even if they have some

1082
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:39,034
sort of a crude form of communication,
what they really lack is the ability to 

1083
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:42,964
understand how the other person thinks 
like you're talking to me and this is 

1084
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:47,740
the first time we've met and we're 
talking and I'm,

1085
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:52,270
I'm getting inside your head even from 
the whole coffee should be black,

1086
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:53,303
you know,
and you have your methodology for the 

1087
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:56,830
rest of my life.
I'm drinking black coffee.

1088
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,260
I'm fine.
Alright,

1089
00:48:58,470 --> 00:48:58,850
what?
I mean,

1090
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,740
but it's like I'm,
I'm,

1091
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,660
I'm seeing how you think and what I do.
What I try to do,

1092
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:05,494
at least is when I'm talking to someone,
I try to sort of empty my head out and 

1093
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:10,930
let them,
let them get in my head.

1094
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,090
Like I would try to think like you're 
thinking.

1095
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,253
Um,
and when I think I've always said that 

1096
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:17,164
that's what's happening in an audience 
when someone's on stage and they're 

1097
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:21,850
killing when a comedian is on stage.
Like if someone,

1098
00:49:21,851 --> 00:49:22,684
if uh,
if I'm watching someone I think is 

1099
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:24,910
really funny,
like bill burr or something like that,

1100
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,590
I give my brain to him.
I get like,

1101
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:30,310
like go ahead and take me on a ride.
And so when,

1102
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,173
when he's on stage and he's killing,
I'm sort of like letting him think for 

1103
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:36,034
me and I'm not questioning or taking 
things down other paths or allowing 

1104
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:46,390
myself to also think about my bills or I
got to get gas before I go home.

1105
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,240
I'm just thinking what he's providing 
me,

1106
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,453
you know,
there's this and that ability is 

1107
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:53,164
uniquely human.
The ability to try to understand how 

1108
00:49:55,841 --> 00:49:57,700
another person is communicating and 
thinking.

1109
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,500
And then I started taking it into 
variables.

1110
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:00,420
Okay.
Like W,

1111
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,340
especially now that I'm a father over 
the last,

1112
00:50:03,341 --> 00:50:04,174
this last quarter of my life,
I've really concentrated on the concept 

1113
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:11,560
of everybody used to be a baby.
Like when I was young and single.

1114
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:15,580
That was everyone was static.
That old lady's always been an old lady.

1115
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,890
That'll do.
That's always been an old dude.

1116
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,500
Now once I had a kid,
once,

1117
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,633
you know from,
from then on when I'm raising my 

1118
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:28,040
children,
people now are babies that grew up.

1119
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,233
Everyone's a baby that became an adult.
I see some crazy old man with a big 

1120
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:34,340
fucking WC fields knows and he's 
drinking and like,

1121
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:36,350
oh,
that guy was a baby at one point in time

1122
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,320
and I've forced myself to go down that 
sort of a path.

1123
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,760
So I think that the ability to,
to,

1124
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,800
to think how other people think and to 
sort of commiserate with each other in a

1125
00:50:47,901 --> 00:50:51,470
very broad and expansive way.
I think that's a very uniquely human.

1126
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,500
I'm not sure.
I think we need to under.

1127
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,960
I mean the more we figure out about like
whale language,

1128
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:58,190
Dolphin language,
right?

1129
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:59,840
There's really,
Jamie,

1130
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:01,790
if you look,
you might be able to dig it up.

1131
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:02,624
There's a,
there's a guy I want to say is that 

1132
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:06,350
northern Arizona University who worked 
on prairie dog language.

1133
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,810
Have you heard about this?
This is crazy research,

1134
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:13,040
so one of the reasons we've never been 
able to study animal communication,

1135
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:13,874
and I could screw this up,
but we'll try it is we couldn't talk 

1136
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:18,230
back,
right?

1137
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,063
We couldn't talk to them.
So what he did is he recorded a ton of 

1138
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,833
prairie dog communication and then 
started sort of decoding what little 

1139
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:30,470
things mean and but used a computer to 
play it back to them.

1140
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:34,790
So what he discovered is prairie dogs,
which you don't think of as particularly

1141
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,624
intelligent.
When they'd started decoding their 

1142
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:37,604
language,
they started to realize that prairie 

1143
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:41,300
dogs routinely say things like,
Hey,

1144
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,253
be careful of that right path over there
because there's a fat guy in a purple 

1145
00:51:45,351 --> 00:51:46,184
sweater coming this way.
That detailed like in the beginning of 

1146
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:49,610
the.
Yeah,

1147
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,510
they used to think animals only sort of 
communicated in like nouns and verbs.

1148
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,240
Present tense nouns and verbs,
right?

1149
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,540
Snake,
the,

1150
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,573
you know,
there are some certain calls that are 

1151
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,690
monkeys,
monkeys right now,

1152
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:04,610
the three calls now they're starting to 
realize they've got adjectives,

1153
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,653
they've got tenses.
They can think in the for a while they 

1154
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:09,620
thought animals lived in a perpetual 
pleasant,

1155
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:10,513
present,
right?

1156
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,600
Like the argument was all animals are 
always in flow bright,

1157
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:15,434
which is the effort focused.
Everything in the now it turns out 

1158
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:18,790
that's not the case at all.
They have passed,

1159
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,633
they have futures.
We asked this question a lot running an 

1160
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:25,340
animal sanctuary because if we,
if we're caring for a dog,

1161
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:28,520
it's not just older special needs,
it's compromise shelter.

1162
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:29,354
It was on death row is probably if it's 
ended up with us because we work with 

1163
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,890
the worst of the worst of the worst.
It's been very,

1164
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:35,350
very badly abused,
et Cetera,

1165
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:36,184
et cetera.
And the question my wife and I always 

1166
00:52:37,581 --> 00:52:40,520
used to talk about was do they know?
Do they like,

1167
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,620
do they feel grateful to us?
Do they,

1168
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,080
can they remember their past enough to 
know that you know,

1169
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,290
the president is different and we were,
we were.

1170
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,570
What was different?
Like those kinds of questions and after,

1171
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,381
you know,
10,

1172
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,390
12 years of doing this work,
hard core,

1173
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:55,640
I think they really know and I think,
you know,

1174
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:57,890
they live in a,
in a timescale that's a lot broader than

1175
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:58,724
we've given them credit for now.
This work that's been done on prairie 

1176
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:03,830
dogs is.
It had been done on any other animals.

1177
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,780
He knew language,
discover,

1178
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:08,480
prairie doggies.
It's a radio lab episode.

1179
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:11,720
Nice.
Powerful radiolab from 2011.

1180
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,010
Radial abs.
Fucking awesome.

1181
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:15,043
By the way,
if you haven't listened to that podcast 

1182
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,800
as folks,
that's one of my all time favorites.

1183
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:21,830
I've learned so much from that show,
but that's incredible.

1184
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:24,170
They can tell you the color of the 
clothes.

1185
00:53:24,171 --> 00:53:26,070
They have a noise for the color.

1186
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,620
Fuck nate.
Right.

1187
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,513
It's incredible.
And it changes the way you think about 

1188
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,730
animals.
Oh yeah,

1189
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:33,600
for sure.
You know?

1190
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:37,260
Well the dolphin one is really weird.
Dolphins.

1191
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:41,580
I've found out recently that the babies 
come up with their own names.

1192
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,773
They come up with names for each other,
like the mother will say something to 

1193
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:47,000
them and then the baby will say 
something that.

1194
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,843
And then the mother will repeat that and
the baby will choose that as a name 

1195
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,370
Dolphin's name themselves.
Yeah.

1196
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:55,560
They named themselves baby's name 
themselves.

1197
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:57,900
Could you imagine if we like human 
babies named themselves again?

1198
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,240
Yeah.
Well I mean,

1199
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,920
dolphins all sound like babies,

1200
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:04,983
you know?
I mean,

1201
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,350
they don't really have.
It's sort of like eating,

1202
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:10,010
right?
Yeah.

1203
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,370
Well,
Dolphin cognitive chairman sounds.

1204
00:54:12,371 --> 00:54:13,041
Yeah.
I mean,

1205
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:14,030
you know what I mean?
There's such.

1206
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,073
That's one of the weirdest things about 
people's that distinctly different 

1207
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:19,280
sounds that we have geographically.
You know,

1208
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:24,281
Middle Eastern has a German,
has a lot of the guttural sort of.

1209
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,430
And then you know,
South America is that flow sort of,

1210
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,593
you know,
the beautiful Latin sounds to a lot of 

1211
00:54:31,401 --> 00:54:32,630
their,
the way they speak.

1212
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:33,863
Yeah.
You don't really see too much of that 

1213
00:54:35,151 --> 00:54:36,920
with dolphins,
but you do see some of it.

1214
00:54:36,921 --> 00:54:39,050
You definitely see some dialects and 
some,

1215
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:42,860
some variables.
That's always the most fascinating thing

1216
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:45,110
to me is that we really don't know what 
the fuck.

1217
00:54:45,111 --> 00:54:46,700
They're soft.
They're saying adult.

1218
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:47,683
Yeah.
And we've been studying it forever and 

1219
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:50,601
there's a lot of.
I mean,

1220
00:54:50,601 --> 00:54:50,960
you've got it.

1221
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,200
There's a lot of human arrogance,
right in the way.

1222
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,380
There's a lot of us being full of 
ourselves and what I mean,

1223
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:58,900
you know,
we,

1224
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:00,130
we want to believe in it.
You know,

1225
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,790
they put it in the Bible where the 
master of Earth Week and you know we,

1226
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:05,053
and that's a hell of a lot easier to be 
if other species aren't conscious and 

1227
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:12,590
aren't communicating and aren't feeling 
well.

1228
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:13,483
What's interesting to me is that they've
determined now at least the people that 

1229
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:18,254
are studying a great,
great apes that chimps have moved into 

1230
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:21,763
stone age.
They believe that chimps are now at the 

1231
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:24,734
beginning stages of the stone age and if
chimps continue to evolve the way they 

1232
00:55:29,091 --> 00:55:33,050
have and the way supposedly we have in a
million years from now,

1233
00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:34,123
chimps might have fucking houses and 
tools and cars and they might be some 

1234
00:55:38,151 --> 00:55:40,250
totally new,
completely different thing.

1235
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,013
There's some kind of Charlton Heston 
joke here just waiting to happen for 

1236
00:55:44,631 --> 00:55:45,710
sure.
Can't get to,

1237
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:49,490
but I mean it makes sense.
If we did at one point in time,

1238
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,740
if we.
Obviously we weren't,

1239
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,700
unless you believe in creationism,
we weren't born as human beings,

1240
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:58,550
we weren't invented and there wasn't an 
anatomy in eve.

1241
00:55:58,850 --> 00:55:59,683
There was some sort of hominid that 
eventually got smarter and through 

1242
00:56:03,681 --> 00:56:07,400
natural selection and through the 
genetic mutations,

1243
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,283
diet choice,
all the different variables that they 

1244
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:13,070
think contributed to the human being 
becoming a human being,

1245
00:56:13,071 --> 00:56:16,070
but it wasn't always that.
So if a chimp,

1246
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,840
like right now,
if we can,

1247
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,810
like,
we observed the meeting tools of,

1248
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,773
I'm sure you've seen the famous photo of
the rang Tang that's holding onto the 

1249
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:25,270
branch spear fishing.
Yes.

1250
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:28,510
Fucking a man.
That one's a mindblower you like,

1251
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:31,330
he's got a tool.
So here's the interesting question,

1252
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:33,340
of course,
because we're probably,

1253
00:56:33,341 --> 00:56:34,174
I mean,
we've already accelerated evolution 

1254
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:36,250
among humans.

1255
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:40,210
We probably can accelerate it among 
other species if we want to.

1256
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,710
Oh yeah,
that's interesting.

1257
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,723
Well,
don't you think it's happening amongst 

1258
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:46,150
humans right now at a spectacular rate 
to.

1259
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:47,680
Oh yeah.
I mean that's all,

1260
00:56:47,830 --> 00:56:48,663
you know,
technical physio evolution is a Robert 

1261
00:56:52,271 --> 00:56:53,750
Fogle's term from timbers.
No,

1262
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:56,680
physio evolution.
He came out of the University of Chicago

1263
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,480
still.
He's an economist.

1264
00:56:58,730 --> 00:56:59,850
Um,
and tech,

1265
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:00,684
the physio evolution is his term for the
fact that we've massively sped up 

1266
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,860
evolution.
Um,

1267
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,813
and it,
you know,

1268
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,830
it's interesting because if you look at 
his work,

1269
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:10,930
it's again,
nothing fancy.

1270
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:11,764
It was sanitation systems and a cleaner 
water and slightly better food and 

1271
00:57:17,111 --> 00:57:18,190
slightly better,
but you know,

1272
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,083
suddenly our lifespan has doubled.
Now when he's talking about techno 

1273
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,570
physio,
he's only talking about using technology

1274
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,433
in terms of like the health benefits of 
it medicine or is he talking about are 

1275
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:32,590
interfacing with technology.

1276
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:36,550
But our interface and we see that to me 
is one of the most bizarre ones.

1277
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,653
Talked about this yesterday,
but I was watching another teen movie 

1278
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:41,080
the other night,
which is just,

1279
00:57:41,081 --> 00:57:42,850
it was,
I was writing and sometimes our right to

1280
00:57:42,851 --> 00:57:47,851
keep the TV on just for a goof.
And it was so unbelievably bad and weird

1281
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:49,603
as I'm moving from 2001 and it was like 
a time capsule and I'm watching this 

1282
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:58,810
thing and I'm like culturally we are so 
far removed that you could not make this

1283
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:01,210
movie today if you made another teen 
movie.

1284
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02,044
It's failed with racism and sexism and 
people get a guy punches a woman in the 

1285
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:07,294
face and it's like a punchline.
I mean there's a lot of crazy fucked up 

1286
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:13,540
shit in this movie and obviously it's a 
comedy and it's parody,

1287
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:17,290
so I'm supposed to be taken literally,
but you can't even do comedies like that

1288
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:18,010
anymore.

1289
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:20,170
Like you watched that movie and you go,
wow,

1290
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:21,004
this is a sign of a time before people 
could communicate instantaneously 

1291
00:58:23,531 --> 00:58:24,364
online.
What would happen if you released 

1292
00:58:25,871 --> 00:58:28,060
blazing saddles today?
Holy Shit.

1293
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,700
Holy Shit.
It's.

1294
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,480
So let me ask you a question since you 
brought it up.

1295
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:34,690
It's totally off topic,
but why doesn't comedy age?

1296
00:58:34,691 --> 00:58:36,730
Well,
it's a very good question.

1297
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,773
You know my,
I think if you want to look at like the 

1298
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,550
all time,
most important comedians,

1299
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,163
I feel like I've always felt like number
one is lenny bruce because lenny bruce 

1300
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:49,600
was getting arrested back when you can't
arrest me.

1301
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:50,710
I didn't.
Haven't said Cock sucker.

1302
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,720
Yeah,
exactly.

1303
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:53,823
He had cultural.
I mean we had cultural blinders on and 

1304
00:58:56,831 --> 00:59:00,970
we had these notions of things you could
and could not say,

1305
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:03,850
and he shattered those.
And one of the ways he did his but going

1306
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:04,684
to jail,
but what he was doing was he was 

1307
00:59:07,721 --> 00:59:12,210
interfacing with a society and a culture
that was infantile.

1308
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:16,060
We were childish back then and we are no
longer like that.

1309
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:16,983
So the things that he was saying that 
were naughty and funny are so 

1310
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:21,240
commonplace.
There's,

1311
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:26,150
there's nothing funny about it.
He did have some lines though that still

1312
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:29,420
to this day hold up.
Like one of them was about gay people.

1313
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,310
He was like,
let me get this straight.

1314
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:34,070
See if you're gaining.
It's illegal.

1315
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,080
So they do is if you have sex with a 
man,

1316
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,680
they put you in jail where men want to 
have sex with you.

1317
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,120
I mean this guy fucking nailed that in 
like 1960.

1318
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,490
It's like,
what in the fuck are you doing?

1319
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,830
I mean people have inadvertently stolen 
that bit.

1320
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,840
Like reinvented it themselves.
I got a friend,

1321
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,550
it was a really funny comic who did that
bit.

1322
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:56,384
And I go,
hey man,

1323
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,060
you need to know Lenny Lenny Bruce did 
that night,

1324
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,050
Mr.
Sixty two.

1325
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:01,070
And he's like,
no fucking way.

1326
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:01,880
I'm like,
yeah.

1327
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,390
He's like,
I thought it was too obvious.

1328
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:05,330
It's too obvious.
That's pretty funny,

1329
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,980
but he,
some of the stuff,

1330
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:08,660
I mean,
you know Robin Williams,

1331
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:11,630
a lot of it's not funny,
but what he can do with his face,

1332
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,750
Jim Carrey,
Sam,

1333
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:16,160
like some of the physical stuff seem to 
hold up because it's still amazing.

1334
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:17,390
You're like,
how the fuck did you do that?

1335
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:21,380
But you know,
interestingly Steve Martin's still holds

1336
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:22,214
up.
Like if you listen to like let's get 

1337
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:24,980
small leg,
it's still holds.

1338
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:28,040
It's so silly and a lot of his stuff was
very physical too.

1339
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,880
We do the balloon animals on his head 
and shit like that when things.

1340
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:32,843
A lot of Richard Pryor hangs in there.
A lot of Richard Pryor still holds up 

1341
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:40,340
some of the standup seems to last a hell
of a lot better than the funny movies.

1342
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:41,900
Like go back and try to watch some of 
the.

1343
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:47,290
My wife had a very strange childhood so 
I didn't see everything I saw coming up,

1344
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:48,464
so I showed her everything,
including all the like Bill Murray 

1345
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:51,913
Movies,
stripes and all that stuff from back 

1346
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:56,810
when stripes now is a really sad movie 
about war.

1347
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,023
Right.
I mean at the time I remember like 

1348
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,370
falling off my chair and being under the
seat.

1349
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,223
Couldn't even breathe.
I was laughing so hard and now I watch 

1350
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:06,440
with my wife and she's looking at me.
She's like,

1351
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,470
you sure man,
this is supposed to be funny.

1352
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,201
I'm like,
no,

1353
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:10,034
no,
this is.

1354
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,480
It's coming.
It's coming.

1355
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,250
And it never comes.
Yeah,

1356
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:16,940
I mean I think that movies are in a lot 
of ways like a slide,

1357
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,190
like a slide for a microscope.
Well,

1358
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:21,110
we can look at a culture,
you know,

1359
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,730
from a time period like,
oh,

1360
01:01:22,731 --> 01:01:26,570
this is 2001 another teen movie.
Let's look at this under the microscope.

1361
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:28,760
And you can check out aspects of the 
culture.

1362
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:29,960
I mean,
watch,

1363
01:01:29,961 --> 01:01:34,190
try to watch a father knows best.
It becomes a comedy,

1364
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:39,080
like it's sort of kind of a comedy when 
it came out and then it becomes lame and

1365
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:42,680
now at the comedy again because really,
because now you watch it and you go,

1366
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:45,150
what in the fuck are they talking about?
It's,

1367
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:50,260
it's almost like some sort of a weird 
sketchy on some television show.

1368
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:52,760
Similarly it's to,
it's a different thing.

1369
01:01:52,761 --> 01:01:55,220
So my wife was,
my wife's a writer also and uh,

1370
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,083
she was working on a project that didn't
end up going when everybody was a TV 

1371
01:01:58,281 --> 01:02:00,860
series based around the women in the 
Manson family.

1372
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:04,670
So I ended up reading everything I could
possibly,

1373
01:02:04,671 --> 01:02:05,504
you know,
to help her out,

1374
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:06,403
learn about the mansons.
And the most interesting thing is how 

1375
01:02:10,071 --> 01:02:12,140
they talk to each other about emotions,
right?

1376
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:12,974
Like whatever else you want to say about
the map Manson at that point they 

1377
01:02:15,471 --> 01:02:20,100
thought they were doing the deepest shit
out there in terms of before things

1378
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,933
got crazy right when it,
when it was just like a psychological 

1379
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,540
calls before it got totally nuts.
But you listen to how they.

1380
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:27,810
They talk about psychedelic things,
our emotions,

1381
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,350
and it's you.
She had one of the problems.

1382
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,410
You ran into it.
She was like,

1383
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:34,650
I don't know what to do here because I 
can't use their dialogue.

1384
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,200
They sound like absolute morons all the 
time.

1385
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,110
There's nothing like his pages of look 
into my.

1386
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:40,944
I know you look into my.
I know you look into my eyes and be 

1387
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,000
like,
holy crap.

1388
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,040
This really like,
it's that dumb.

1389
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,940
Yeah.
I'm always interested in and I've looked

1390
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,530
at it and I can't.
I can't really,

1391
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,920
but I'm interested in how the language 
has changed.

1392
01:02:55,921 --> 01:02:56,940
I always thought that,
you know,

1393
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,640
in the sixties we had no language for a 
lot of,

1394
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,610
a lot of these ideas by the seventies 
with the me generation,

1395
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:03,683
we started to put a little more language
around psychological states and what 

1396
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:07,914
that it was by the eighties,
it got a little farmer and around the 

1397
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:11,214
nineties is when it cut a normalized and
suddenly like guys could talk about 

1398
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:15,810
having emotions for the first time.

1399
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:17,820
People don't talk about this back in the
eighties,

1400
01:03:17,821 --> 01:03:18,654
but like the most rebellious thing a guy
could do in the early eighties was have 

1401
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,600
feelings which nobody.
Now you'd be like,

1402
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:27,480
what really are you kidding?
But that's,

1403
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,343
you know,
I thought that was really interesting 

1404
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:30,083
and you can see it in the language and 
how we talk about things like emotions 

1405
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:34,200
and psychological problems evolve.
Yeah.

1406
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:38,190
He didn't cry in the sixties right after
day.

1407
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,730
No,
not definitely.

1408
01:03:39,731 --> 01:03:40,564
Not In the fifties.

1409
01:03:41,170 --> 01:03:43,360
Definitely not in the fifties.
There was the strong silent.

1410
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:43,840
I mean,
you know,

1411
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:45,490
obviously it's a stereotype so it's not 
real,

1412
01:03:45,491 --> 01:03:47,770
but it was the strong silent type.
We know that's what people wanted.

1413
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,260
They wanted that

1414
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:51,350
John Wayne guy or counselor.
Yeah.

1415
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,420
Yeah.
That's interesting.

1416
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,080
I,
I,

1417
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:54,913
you know,
I mean maybe that's just a sign of the 

1418
01:03:55,611 --> 01:03:56,444
times because the world was hard and 
you're coming off of the depression and 

1419
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:00,614
from the depression,
you grow up and you're living in the 19 

1420
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:03,014
fifties now.
Does those are the adults that grew up 

1421
01:04:05,661 --> 01:04:07,120
during that time,
you know,

1422
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,760
you're in your late thirties or early 
forties and your,

1423
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:13,070
you know,
you're dealing with the ramifications of

1424
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:14,443
all the shit that you had to go through 
and what society was going through when 

1425
01:04:17,031 --> 01:04:19,250
you were a kid and it was hard,
hard times.

1426
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,810
W no room for pussies.

1427
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,930
You asked my grandmother what life was 
like in Russia before she died.

1428
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:24,823
She only had it.
She would never tell us which had one 

1429
01:04:25,971 --> 01:04:27,590
answer,
which was we ate potatoes.

1430
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:28,840
Whoa.
What was,

1431
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:29,840
what was Russia like?
Grandma,

1432
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,990
we ate potatoes.
So it was Russia.

1433
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,230
Difficult.
We ate potatoes.

1434
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,430
Yeah.
My Grandmother,

1435
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:38,070
when she died,
had money stashed all around the house.

1436
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,203
She'd take money and put it in coffee 
cans and Tuck it under a floorboard or 

1437
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:45,120
stick it behind book somewhere like they
had.

1438
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:48,170
She had stashed things everywhere.
She was always worried that it was going

1439
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:51,120
to fall apart again because she had 
grown as a depression baby.

1440
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,513
She had grown up in the heat of it and 
it was just people not knowing if there 

1441
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:58,650
was going to be any food.
And wondering,

1442
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,660
you know,
if they were ever going to get a job,

1443
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,310
if they're ever going to get out of this
whole,

1444
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,700
yeah,
we're soft as fuck right now.

1445
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,534
So we concern ourselves with the 78 
different gender pronouns that they've 

1446
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,680
decided exist and all the other 
different.

1447
01:05:11,681 --> 01:05:12,860
Is that a real number?
We make a.

1448
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:13,800
no,
it's real now.

1449
01:05:13,801 --> 01:05:16,200
It's apparently it's deep into the 
seventies.

1450
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,190
And you're supposed to recognize them.

1451
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,150
Yeah.
No,

1452
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:19,983
not kidding.
I'm Jordan Peterson coming on in a 

1453
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:22,503
couple of weeks and talk about this.
He's a professor at the University of 

1454
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:29,440
Toronto and I'm in Toronto.
Canada has different laws and they don't

1455
01:05:29,441 --> 01:05:31,210
really.
They have censorship,

1456
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,073
they have legitimate censorship and they
have a human rights council and the 

1457
01:05:35,291 --> 01:05:36,124
human rights council can determine 
whether or not you are insensitive to 

1458
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,650
someone else's belief systems.
And if you are,

1459
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:45,130
you can be charged so you can.
You can go to jail,

1460
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:45,964
you can be brought in front of a court.
You could be fined if you don't use the 

1461
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:52,480
correct gender pronouns that they have 
decided.

1462
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,360
I mean right now it's just theoretical.
It hasn't been,

1463
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,250
you know.
No one's at straight out of orwell.

1464
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:58,720
Well,
it's also in New York City.

1465
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,183
I don't know if you know this,
but New York City now has new laws were 

1466
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:03,214
31 different gender pronouns are 
recognized and if you are either an 

1467
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:07,414
employer or if you are a landlord and 
you choose to miss gender someone and 

1468
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:16,390
not use the appropriate gender pronoun 
that they prefer,

1469
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:19,450
you can be fined $250,000.

1470
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:21,603
That has not happened yet,
but that is a real law that has been 

1471
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:27,880
passed to try to stop transgender 
discrimination.

1472
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,090
But how would you know in advance which 
you have to ask?

1473
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:33,220
What pronouns do you prefer?
I see,

1474
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:36,100
so everybody gets to be special without 
doing anything special.

1475
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:37,323
Why?
Because it's easy to get food and 

1476
01:06:39,191 --> 01:06:40,024
there's nothing.
Nothing does nothing dangerous on the 

1477
01:06:41,951 --> 01:06:42,784
horizon.
So we look for problems and these are 

1478
01:06:45,641 --> 01:06:46,474
one of the problems that people look for
and what's really fascinating is that 

1479
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:49,503
it's not really.
It's not transgender people that really 

1480
01:06:51,821 --> 01:06:52,654
want this.
It's Weirdos because transgender people 

1481
01:06:55,331 --> 01:06:57,400
want to be either.
If it's a man,

1482
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,590
they want to be a woman and they'd 
prefer to be,

1483
01:06:59,830 --> 01:07:03,310
for the most part,
prefer to be called a she or her and use

1484
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:06,060
the female gender pronouns.
And for females to male,

1485
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:06,894
it's the opposite.

1486
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:08,043
It's these people that want to be a z or
a here or a bunch of different fucking 

1487
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,960
weird ones that they've invented.
They're just,

1488
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,180
they're playing a game.
They're like,

1489
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,710
they're,
they're in Narnia.

1490
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:18,611
I mean,
they're,

1491
01:07:18,611 --> 01:07:20,170
they're playing dress up.
I mean,

1492
01:07:20,171 --> 01:07:21,520
it's just weird,
bizarre thing.

1493
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:22,383
I've,
I'm now I'm making up names for what I 

1494
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:25,090
am.
I'm a Fox.

1495
01:07:25,091 --> 01:07:26,690
Can you know what I mean?
Uh,

1496
01:07:26,691 --> 01:07:27,301
you know,
I've,

1497
01:07:27,301 --> 01:07:28,260
I've,
you know,

1498
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,580
you look a little like a fuck.
Thank you.

1499
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:30,423
Just thinking that when I came in,
I mean this is exactly the same kind of 

1500
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:33,364
thinking that's behind it.
It's like this is not an 

1501
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,720
antidiscrimination problem.
It's a,

1502
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:40,460
it's a self indulgence problem more than
anything.

1503
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,550
And,
and you know,

1504
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,150
what passes for creative self 
expression,

1505
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:47,440
like gut and do something in the world 
and go do something.

1506
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:49,390
Yeah.
What do you do when they have time to be

1507
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,670
coming up with 78 different gender 
pronouns?

1508
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,970
Fuck doing right.
Let's examine what's going on here.

1509
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,930
Tinder updates including 37 new gender 
identity options,

1510
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,930
37 new ones,
new ones,

1511
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:03,423
37 new ones.
We're going to look back at this time 

1512
01:08:06,581 --> 01:08:07,414
and we're going to fucking laugh the way
we don't laugh at old comedies were 

1513
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:11,973
going to laugh at the actual historical 
documents that show how fucking 

1514
01:08:16,341 --> 01:08:17,174
ridiculous people in 2016,
where we're going to look at people 50 

1515
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:20,610
years from now,
we're gonna.

1516
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:21,443
Look back and go,
what in the fuck were they doing before 

1517
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,050
the asteroid hit?
Right?

1518
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:28,040
They were going crazy that it's almost 
like Rome before the fall,

1519
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:28,874
right?
We're all just going crazy and just 

1520
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:36,670
completely obsessed with nonsense,
but I think that that also speaks to the

1521
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:38,864
desire or the the requirement that human
beings have for a certain amount of 

1522
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,520
engagement in their environment and a 
certain amount of drama and conflict.

1523
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:54,050
I think we're wired for it.
I think we're wired for a certain amount

1524
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:54,884
of conflict and resolution and problem 
solving and I think that's one of the 

1525
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:00,800
reasons why people really like doing 
things that are difficult.

1526
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:01,634
I've been writing about this lately 
because I've become obsessed with yoga 

1527
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:07,820
over the last couple of years and I suck
at it.

1528
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:12,290
I'm not very good at it,
but as I do it and continue to do it and

1529
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:13,124
get better at it,
I feel like it's making everything else 

1530
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:17,010
in my life better.
I don't think there's any way that girl.

1531
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:18,770
There's an athlete without yoga.
It doesn't.

1532
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,070
It doesn't work.
You just break too many things.

1533
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:21,923
I think you're totally right and I think
it has a negative connotation because 

1534
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:30,140
people think of it as like being soccer 
moms and it's fucking hard.

1535
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,003
Oh yeah.
The first time.

1536
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,100
So I put about 65 hairline fractures and
my legs.

1537
01:09:34,101 --> 01:09:38,630
I shattered my legs and I'm 65 hairline 
all in one.

1538
01:09:39,370 --> 01:09:40,330
Okay.
Longer story.

1539
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:42,730
Okay.
When I was a 16,

1540
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:45,600
skied off a cliff in Switzerland,
split my.

1541
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,473
Didn't see it,
the nose there and split my Patellas so 

1542
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:52,930
my knees never folded right.
So when I started,

1543
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:53,783
but when you say split my Patella,
I mean I cracked my kneecaps and back 

1544
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,760
then they couldn't do anything for it.
They couldn't.

1545
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:05,890
So they just let it heal and my legs 
didn't fold quite right.

1546
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,530
So the angle was off.
So I,

1547
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,413
you know,
when I came up I started out as a 

1548
01:10:10,781 --> 01:10:11,614
journalist.
One of the action and adventure sports 

1549
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:13,654
were starting out.
It was the early nineties and you could 

1550
01:10:15,251 --> 01:10:19,810
ski and ride or surfing right,
or rock climbing or there was work and I

1551
01:10:19,811 --> 01:10:21,550
couldn't do any of those things very,
very well.

1552
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,384
But I lied to my editors because I 
wanted the work and I was really 

1553
01:10:24,101 --> 01:10:24,820
fascinated with.

1554
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,653
So I spent about five or six years 
chasing athletes around mountains and I 

1555
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:28,714
broke a lot of bones along the way.
What happened was every time I impacted 

1556
01:10:33,761 --> 01:10:34,594
right ever.
So if skiing bumps dropped off a little 

1557
01:10:36,281 --> 01:10:37,114
something,
I would put microfracture in my legs a 

1558
01:10:39,461 --> 01:10:41,470
little one.
And then as of your nice structures,

1559
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:44,110
they weren't told it wasn't folding.
Right?

1560
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:46,810
So the shock absorbers was working,
working.

1561
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,340
And so,
you know,

1562
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:49,263
one day they all turned into bigger 
fractures and I sort of collapsed and 

1563
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,393
you know,
I remember when I was at the Cleveland 

1564
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,040
Clinic and the doc walked out holding up
my extra and he was like,

1565
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,030
the cube.
He's like,

1566
01:11:01,031 --> 01:11:02,830
how do you even walk in here,
man?

1567
01:11:02,831 --> 01:11:04,270
And I was like,
what are you talking about?

1568
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:05,540
He's like,
yeah man,

1569
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,570
you're days of skiing or running.
He's like,

1570
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,160
that's over.
And I was like,

1571
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,750
fuck,
if it's over,

1572
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:11,890
you're out of your mind.

1573
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,700
It was like 20 or something like that.
No.

1574
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:16,500
And I,
for whatever,

1575
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:17,860
I don't even remember what tricked me 
into it.

1576
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:20,560
I started doing the yoga and the reason 
I,

1577
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:21,630
I mean I like,
I went,

1578
01:11:21,631 --> 01:11:23,730
I was like,
maybe I needed more flexibility.

1579
01:11:23,731 --> 01:11:25,460
Maybe that was the key.
Um,

1580
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,640
but I remember the first time I went 
into the yoga class and you know,

1581
01:11:28,641 --> 01:11:29,474
you sort of like,
you look to your right and there's a 75 

1582
01:11:31,891 --> 01:11:35,450
year old woman who's doing stuff that 
like I can't even begin to do.

1583
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:36,450
And I like,
it hurt so much.

1584
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:37,284
I've got tears rolling down my feet to 
try to like get in that position and I 

1585
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:40,800
was like,
fuck that.

1586
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:44,790
There's no way I'm going to be 
fascinated by that and I just stuck with

1587
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:46,740
it because I know I'm competitive and I 
was like,

1588
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,450
she can do it.
I can do it.

1589
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,230
Yeah.
This is one old woman.

1590
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,050
I hate calling her old woman.
She's a nice lady.

1591
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,373
I don't want to use any pejorative,
but she's a probably deep into her 

1592
01:11:57,611 --> 01:12:00,640
sixties I would imagine she's there 
every time I'm there.

1593
01:12:00,641 --> 01:12:01,474
I don't know how often she goes,
but she's there almost every time I'm 

1594
01:12:03,671 --> 01:12:04,504
there.
That lady busts her ass every class and 

1595
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:12,910
she walks out of there smiling and happy
and I'm like,

1596
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:13,744
how many people that are in her age 
group have that kind of energy and that 

1597
01:12:17,231 --> 01:12:20,830
kind of vitality to get through a 90 
minute hot yoga class.

1598
01:12:20,831 --> 01:12:23,230
It'd be smiling and chipper when it's 
all over.

1599
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:25,300
It's awesome.
It's awesome.

1600
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,780
It's.
But my point was that the.

1601
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,280
I really think that doing difficult 
things.

1602
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,131
Oh yeah.
Totally.

1603
01:12:31,131 --> 01:12:32,510
Very important.
Will you also,

1604
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:33,463
you know,
we were talking about earlier like flow 

1605
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,920
shows up when our skills are stretched 
to the Max and we know,

1606
01:12:39,921 --> 01:12:41,790
and this is go back to chicks at me.
Hi.

1607
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,420
Um,
but there's massive data on this at this

1608
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:46,670
point.
The people who are happiest,

1609
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,863
the people who have score off the charts
for overall life satisfaction and 

1610
01:12:50,391 --> 01:12:52,850
wellbeing or the people with the most 
flow in their lives.

1611
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,073
So people the most flown their lives are
people who are constantly challenging 

1612
01:12:57,171 --> 01:12:59,900
themselves,
are constantly pushing all the time.

1613
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,530
That totally makes sense to me.
I'm,

1614
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:07,410
I'm absolutely at my most happy when I'm
involved in difficult activities.

1615
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,700
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1616
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:09,903
And in you know,
and also like shitty results sometimes 

1617
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:13,434
too.
We don't feel good and then you just 

1618
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:15,924
rebuild and figure out what went wrong 
and then bounce back from those shitty 

1619
01:13:18,631 --> 01:13:21,450
results and then achieve something that 
you had achieved before.

1620
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:24,630
And then you get this giant boost of 
happiness and satisfaction.

1621
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,033
And it's also,
I feel energized and engaged as long as 

1622
01:13:28,561 --> 01:13:29,394
I'm doing difficult things all the time.
Whether it's archery or martial arts or 

1623
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:36,580
yoga or something difficult things for 
whatever reason when I'm doing them,

1624
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:39,690
my brain is in a good state.
You know,

1625
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:42,990
it's one of the reasons why I've been so
fascinated with your work and these,

1626
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:43,853
these concepts of flow is because I feel
like there's a whole bunch of different 

1627
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:53,511
variables that or different states that 
you achieve in the mind.

1628
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:54,773
Like there's a,
there's a momentum state that I feel 

1629
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:57,054
like I get when I'm doing all the stuff 
I'm supposed to do when I'm writing a 

1630
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:01,284
lot.
I'm exercising a lot and I'm eating 

1631
01:14:01,981 --> 01:14:02,814
healthy a lot.
I have this momentum state and that 

1632
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:08,040
momentum state is a different state than
the flow state.

1633
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:09,920
It's like this,
um,

1634
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:10,560
it,
it,

1635
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:15,560
it success or it propagates the concept 
of a continuing to improve [inaudible] I

1636
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:19,310
know what you're talking about.
And it's,

1637
01:14:19,870 --> 01:14:22,550
I tend to notice,
let's call it the momentum stage.

1638
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,630
When I'm getting into flow fairly 
frequently,

1639
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,790
that tends to show up at other times.
And I,

1640
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:29,973
you know,
I,

1641
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:35,640
I always,
I always think like when that feeling is

1642
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:38,410
really present,
that's when you make big bets.

1643
01:14:38,411 --> 01:14:40,570
That's when you really go because you've
got,

1644
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:43,150
you know,
wind in your sails driving you.

1645
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:43,984
If I'm not feeling that,
I mean I will always be willing to take 

1646
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:49,120
a big risk and challenge myself and 
whatever,

1647
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:49,954
but I'm much more comfortable doing it 
when I'm feeling that momentum because 

1648
01:14:52,151 --> 01:14:52,810
then I,
you know,

1649
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:55,150
I know I've at least I got a shot at it 
for sure.

1650
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:57,300
One hundred percent.
And that exists with a.

1651
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:59,950
it's a big one with martial artists.
It's a big one with fighters.

1652
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:02,830
You see that with fighters when they 
have a bad result,

1653
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:04,113
they have this rebuilding period.
We're oftentimes they are on shaky legs 

1654
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,820
and then sometimes they never come back 
from it.

1655
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:10,953
You know,
sometimes one bad result for a fighter 

1656
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:15,730
in their careers essentially over there 
ghost of themselves.

1657
01:15:16,030 --> 01:15:16,863
But up until that moment,
there's fighters have these dates that 

1658
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:22,900
they achieve.
A perfect example is Anderson Silva,

1659
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:25,750
when he was in his prime,
Anderson Silva was widely recognized,

1660
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,593
is if not number one,
certainly in the top two or three best 

1661
01:15:29,651 --> 01:15:33,430
fighters of all time and UFC considers 
them the best of all time,

1662
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:34,503
but he had achieved this state of mind 
and of performance when he was at the 

1663
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:40,533
end of his reign is the middleweight 
champion when he was almost in the 

1664
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:42,934
matrix,
I mean he would fight guys and stand 

1665
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:45,310
right in front of them.

1666
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,143
They would throw punches and he would 
just slide out of the way effortlessly 

1667
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:49,623
and then knocked him out and drop them.
There's this famous fight that he had 

1668
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:53,570
with forrest griffin for the,
um,

1669
01:15:53,930 --> 01:15:54,763
well it was one of his first fights at 
light heavyweight when he was the 

1670
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:57,874
middleweight champion.
So he's fighting 20 pounds above his 

1671
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,870
weight class against,
uh,

1672
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:02,170
a really like,
watch this,

1673
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,510
look at this.
This is a look at this.

1674
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:07,210
Watch how he's standing right in front 
of them.

1675
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:10,780
And it just moves out of the way.
Every time for us tries to punch him.

1676
01:16:10,781 --> 01:16:13,600
He's not there.
And then watch this being.

1677
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,240
It just cracks him.
I mean it's,

1678
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,230
it's,
it's watching it live.

1679
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:19,720
I was like,
this guy is a fucking wizard.

1680
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,340
I mean,
it's really strange.

1681
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:23,410
I mean he was standing in front of them 
like,

1682
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:24,843
like he saw everything coming in slow 
motion and forrest is a world class 

1683
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:30,214
fighter.

1684
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,113
He,
I mean there's a bunch of videos of 

1685
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:35,290
Anderson like that being in the matrix.
He stood with his back.

1686
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:36,124
He fought this guy,
Stephan Bonner stood with his back 

1687
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:39,070
against the cages,
stood there,

1688
01:16:39,071 --> 01:16:42,660
dropped his hands and invited the guy to
just throw punches and kicks Adam.

1689
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:43,683
And then when the guy tried to attack 
you just slip right out of the way and 

1690
01:16:46,241 --> 01:16:47,710
then he went right back to the spot and 
he goes,

1691
01:16:47,711 --> 01:16:48,550
come on,
let's do it again.

1692
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,500
And the guy who was,
he was like,

1693
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:52,330
what in the fuck is happening to me 
here?

1694
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,380
Because he was being humiliated is 
embarrassing as hell.

1695
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,273
Fifteen seconds later he smashes him 
with Anita stomach and knocks him 

1696
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:02,530
unconscious.
And I mean it was just,

1697
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,590
he,
he had achieved this weird state because

1698
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:08,470
of the momentum of his success,
his confidence.

1699
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:09,913
And you also had this weird aura about 
him when he was at the top where 

1700
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:13,184
everyone was terrified of him because he
could do things like that and you had a 

1701
01:17:16,161 --> 01:17:16,994
feeling that maybe he's going to put his
back up against the cage with you and 

1702
01:17:19,191 --> 01:17:19,970
humiliate you.

1703
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:22,940
So you were almost training in vain,
like training,

1704
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:25,630
thinking that like one day I'm going to 
get in there with this guy and I'm going

1705
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,170
to get fucked up.
Like everybody else.

1706
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:28,011
Be like,
well,

1707
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:29,220
I'll tell my friend.
Yeah,

1708
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:33,170
well he was like water for a long time.
But the thing that got him,

1709
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,510
well father time got him for sure.
But he had.

1710
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,640
He got knocked out by this Guy Chris 
Weidman.

1711
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:38,474
He got knocked out doing that.
He got knocked out like joking around 

1712
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:46,010
and putting his hands down and Weidman 
just judged where he was going to be and

1713
01:17:46,011 --> 01:17:47,960
faked him out and caught him with a big 
punch.

1714
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,330
Knocked unconscious.
And he's never been the same again now.

1715
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:51,290
That's interesting.
Yeah,

1716
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:53,300
just all stopped right there.

1717
01:17:54,190 --> 01:17:55,340
I did not.
I have noticed,

1718
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,253
and I think it's one of the more 
interesting things about kind of 

1719
01:17:58,700 --> 01:17:59,533
breaking bones as an athlete is it 
doesn't matter consciously how brave I 

1720
01:18:04,641 --> 01:18:07,850
want to be.
Like a couple years ago I did this and I

1721
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:10,340
basically nearly severed my hand from 
my.

1722
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,263
What's going on in there?
I was at 25 foot cliff that I swear I 

1723
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,083
ordered a 35 foot cliff at.
I under jumped it and I basically went 

1724
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,910
wrist.
I flipped upside down,

1725
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:21,300
rates went down,
um,

1726
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:27,580
but for a year and a half after it,
whenever I was above exposed rock.

1727
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:33,770
So which happens as a skier,
a downhill mountain bike or all the top,

1728
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,633
you're always,
I would have an immediate fight or 

1729
01:18:36,321 --> 01:18:37,154
flight response.
It would freeze and just start shaking 

1730
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:41,120
and I couldn't.
There was nothing.

1731
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:41,954
I mean that I just had to kind of expose
myself to it over and it took about a 

1732
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:47,143
year to like calm down.
I've discovered that after a big 

1733
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:52,040
accident,
like a broken bone,

1734
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,540
torn rotator cuffs,
something like that.

1735
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,093
It's going to take me six to eight 
months at to just like get my 

1736
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:03,080
unconscious back and ready to kind of 
take risks again.

1737
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:04,370
It doesn't matter.
You know,

1738
01:19:04,371 --> 01:19:05,204
I could be healed from the injury.
I could be in better shape than I was 

1739
01:19:07,491 --> 01:19:08,840
before the injury,
whatever.

1740
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:10,123
It's gonna take like six or eight months
from my subconscious to like get all 

1741
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:16,370
that fear out and actually reset towards
normal.

1742
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:18,060
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1743
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:20,120
And when fighters lose,
there's a,

1744
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:22,770
there's a physical aspect of it to the 
injury.

1745
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:23,663
Like if they get knocked out,
especially they're worried about taking 

1746
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:26,694
a punch and sometimes that takes a long 
time before they can feel confident 

1747
01:19:30,001 --> 01:19:32,600
enough to take a blow again.
But there's also this,

1748
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,434
uh,
there's an illusion of invulnerability 

1749
01:19:35,641 --> 01:19:37,710
that they achieve when they're at the 
very best.

1750
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:40,110
And that illusion is shattered when they
realized like,

1751
01:19:40,111 --> 01:19:41,670
Oh,
well now I'm the nail.

1752
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,010
I used to be the hammer,
but today I'm the nail.

1753
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,020
How,
how do you deal with being the nail?

1754
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,153
And that's,
I think probably one of the biggest 

1755
01:19:49,111 --> 01:19:51,620
psychological barriers that a fighter 
can overcome.

1756
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:52,980
Their own mortality

1757
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:56,520
was your answer to that problem in what?
Which one?

1758
01:19:56,521 --> 01:19:58,170
How do you come back from becoming an 
ale

1759
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,420
ends on the person?
Depends on where you are in your career.

1760
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,583
For some fighters they have to recognize
that because of the amount of damage 

1761
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:08,030
that they've taken,
I'm like,

1762
01:20:08,031 --> 01:20:08,864
you have what?
The way I always like to describe it is 

1763
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:13,980
like you have a ticket and there's a 
certain amount of holes you can punch on

1764
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:16,950
that ticket and when you punch too many 
holes on that ticket,

1765
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:18,930
you don't get those back.
That's it.

1766
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:19,883
It's over and you have to really be 
aware of that because if you start 

1767
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:23,814
getting delusional or new started having
this ridiculous idea that you're 

1768
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:28,584
different than everybody else had been 
there before you and even though you've 

1769
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:31,314
been getting knocked out regularly and 
training because your Chin's gone that 

1770
01:20:34,771 --> 01:20:36,270
somehow now they're going to be able to 
put it together.

1771
01:20:36,271 --> 01:20:39,150
When the fight comes,
you can only take so many shots.

1772
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:40,313
You know,
you can only take so much trauma 

1773
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,520
particularly in the brain,
but I'm sure in the body as well.

1774
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,470
I mean,
I don't know how much work has been done

1775
01:20:46,471 --> 01:20:47,304
studying body trauma,
but I can only imagine the amount of 

1776
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,500
scar tissue that you build up.
I getting kicked in the liver,

1777
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,150
you know,
camp after camp,

1778
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:54,984
fight after fight.
I mean it cannot be good for your 

1779
01:20:56,911 --> 01:20:58,290
kidneys.
Get abused,

1780
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,463
your,
your internal organs get smashed by 

1781
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:05,550
kicks and punches on a regular basis.
Your body only has so much resilience,

1782
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,683
so if someone is there because someone's
in a bad state because they're 22 years 

1783
01:21:11,281 --> 01:21:13,410
old and they fought someone that got 
knocked out,

1784
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:14,273
I would say they just need to take some 
time off rest of the brain because 

1785
01:21:17,791 --> 01:21:18,624
that's very important.
It's one thing that a lot of fighters 

1786
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:23,490
fuck up on as they try to get right back
in there and you're vulnerable.

1787
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:25,430
You're much more vulnerable than you 
were before when you were.

1788
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:26,273
You've been knocked out.
Have you been knocked completely 

1789
01:21:27,811 --> 01:21:28,644
unconscious and flatlined.
It is way easier for you to be knocked 

1790
01:21:30,721 --> 01:21:31,250
out again.
Well,

1791
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:31,880
that's.
Well,

1792
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,540
that's all the Tbi stuff,
right?

1793
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:35,370
Like that's why there's concussion 
protocols.

1794
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,213
Yeah.
You've got gotta wait super vulnerable 

1795
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:41,610
right afterwards.
I remember like it was a car accident,

1796
01:21:41,611 --> 01:21:42,444
concussion,
but I remember going rock climbing and 

1797
01:21:44,101 --> 01:21:46,380
it was two,
three weeks after and I was,

1798
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,503
you know,
500 feet up on the wall as vertigo or 

1799
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:52,050
something.
All kinds of craziness.

1800
01:21:52,051 --> 01:21:55,290
Like legos started sweating.
Thing started like it was,

1801
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:58,650
my brain just was like,
Jesus Christ handle this at all.

1802
01:21:58,651 --> 01:21:59,484
It was fine.
There was lots of ropes and protection 

1803
01:22:00,311 --> 01:22:02,010
and my friend just got me off the wall.
It wasn't,

1804
01:22:02,011 --> 01:22:02,844
it wasn't a big deal,
but I remember at the time and I was 

1805
01:22:04,621 --> 01:22:05,431
like,
you know,

1806
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:08,970
I'm looking for a hole that was looking 
for a cold and a crack or something like

1807
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,240
that were like three cracks.

1808
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,073
And I was like,
wait a minute.

1809
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,740
There were not three cracks here a 
second ago.

1810
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:18,120
What the hell just happened?
Have brain trauma is no joke.

1811
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:22,140
So I think for fighters there would be 
the physical aspect of it and the mental

1812
01:22:22,141 --> 01:22:22,974
aspect of it,
both of them are very difficult to 

1813
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:25,710
overcome.
I think if you're younger,

1814
01:22:25,711 --> 01:22:29,580
the physical aspect is easier to resolve
and you just need time.

1815
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,400
And uh,
the psychological aspect,

1816
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,283
you know what I mean?
Some people get over it better than 

1817
01:22:34,021 --> 01:22:34,854
others.
Some people have a more honest 

1818
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:38,870
assessment of themselves as a human and 
as a,

1819
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:40,130
as a competitor,
and they,

1820
01:22:40,131 --> 01:22:43,440
they understand that this is just a 
really difficult thing they're doing and

1821
01:22:43,441 --> 01:22:45,480
sometimes it's going to work out and 
sometimes it's not.

1822
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:49,590
And other people to just think I am the 
baddest motherfucker that's ever lived.

1823
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:51,180
And then boom,
something happens.

1824
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:51,781
They're like,
oh my God,

1825
01:22:51,781 --> 01:22:52,860
I'm just,
I'm normal.

1826
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:55,170
And that's really hard for them.
It's a mindset thing,

1827
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:56,004
right?
The difference between a fixed and a 

1828
01:22:56,461 --> 01:22:57,900
growth mindset.
Yeah,

1829
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,340
it is.
And it's also,

1830
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:00,373
it's a,
it's a difference between someone who's 

1831
01:23:01,950 --> 01:23:02,783
been lucky and understands that they've 
been lucky and someone who's been lucky 

1832
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:09,760
and it feels like they've been blessed 
by the gods.

1833
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,450
And then all of a sudden the gods have 
rescinded their program and they say,

1834
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:14,520
look,
they're fickle that way.

1835
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:16,420
You're just normal.
You're mortal.

1836
01:23:16,690 --> 01:23:18,910
It's,
there's so many variables.

1837
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:19,744
And it's like how it happened to you.
Was it a lucky shot that you got hit 

1838
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:24,430
with?
Was it a prolonged beating?

1839
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:28,060
Which is oftentimes the worst when a guy
really gets beat up,

1840
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:29,223
it's really hard for them to come back 
because what you see inside the octagon 

1841
01:23:33,311 --> 01:23:36,040
with when a person gets beaten up is 
just the beginning of it.

1842
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,353
What really happens after that is 
ringing in the ears for weeks with 

1843
01:23:41,421 --> 01:23:42,254
Vertigo.
Fucking horrible bruises all over your 

1844
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:50,101
face and your body and aching and in 
terrible pain for a long time.

1845
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,960
When you see a guy get the fuck beat out
of him.

1846
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:54,760
That's just the beginning of his 
struggle.

1847
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:57,070
You know what?
What you see,

1848
01:23:57,071 --> 01:24:00,370
especially a really bad knockout.
You our entire.

1849
01:24:00,371 --> 01:24:03,100
It's entirely possible you're seeing 
someone will never be the same again.

1850
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:05,560
That's heavy.
Yeah,

1851
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:08,590
change.
It changes the way you watch fighting.

1852
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:09,850
Well,
my good friend Dr.

1853
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:12,890
Mark Gordon is a specialist in traumatic
brain injuries.

1854
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:13,980
I know mark.
Yeah.

1855
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:15,090
Palladium.
Yes.

1856
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:18,160
Yes.
He's helped me when I had lyme disease.

1857
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,720
Oh,
did he really did that?

1858
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,070
That guy's awesome.
I love him.

1859
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:22,233
But he's worked with so many football 
players and soldiers and now he's 

1860
01:24:24,881 --> 01:24:26,470
working.
He's done some work with fighters too,

1861
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:29,620
but you know,
he's adamant about it.

1862
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:32,650
He's like,
once you start ringing that bell,

1863
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:33,731
you know,
you,

1864
01:24:33,731 --> 01:24:34,564
you gotta do everything you can to heal 
that thing up and you cannot just jump 

1865
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:39,304
right back into it.
So when you see these football players 

1866
01:24:41,111 --> 01:24:41,944
that are getting fucking cracked and 
then two periods later they're jumping 

1867
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:45,910
back in,
you know,

1868
01:24:45,911 --> 01:24:48,550
that's crazy.
You're doing a crazy thing.

1869
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:49,384
You got flat lined and then you're 
jumping back in the game three quarters 

1870
01:24:52,841 --> 01:24:54,550
later or two quarters later.
That's crazy.

1871
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,710
Yeah,
and it's common.

1872
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,080
It's common wealth.
I mean,

1873
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,630
you know,
try to tell anybody anything when you're

1874
01:25:01,631 --> 01:25:02,620
22,
23,

1875
01:25:02,621 --> 01:25:03,454
24,
you know,

1876
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:05,590
at that age,
especially at.

1877
01:25:05,591 --> 01:25:06,424
But if you're a professional athlete and
you've trained yourself to be fiercely 

1878
01:25:09,191 --> 01:25:11,170
competitive in that ferocious and 
everything else,

1879
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:12,543
it's hard to dial that back was just 
such a scary thing though because 

1880
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:16,054
compromising the ability to think 
correctly to me is one of the scariest 

1881
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:20,590
things that could happen to you.

1882
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:23,650
That was,
I had lyme disease and one of the,

1883
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:26,190
and I spent three years in bed,
but the worst part about lyme disease,

1884
01:25:26,500 --> 01:25:28,300
I was really sick.
Jesus Christ.

1885
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,550
That's where the research came from.
Yeah.

1886
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,463
I pulled myself out of it through 
surfing and these crazy altered states 

1887
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:38,170
that was happening while I was surfing.
And my first question was,

1888
01:25:38,171 --> 01:25:39,190
what the fuck is gold?
Right.

1889
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:40,024
Surfing is not.
I've known carol for chronic autoimmune 

1890
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:43,540
conditions.
And why was it having,

1891
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:46,590
having these crazy altered state of 
consciousness experiences while surfing?

1892
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:48,040
That's where it started for me.
Um,

1893
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,560
but with lyme,
I mean,

1894
01:25:51,630 --> 01:25:54,250
you'd go crazy.
You become extremely paranoid.

1895
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:57,730
The most common misdiagnosis for lyme is
paranoid schizophrenia.

1896
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:58,973
So you become extremely paranoid.
I was hallucinating short term memory 

1897
01:26:02,261 --> 01:26:03,750
gone,
longterm memory gone.

1898
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,490
Been dyslexic.

1899
01:26:04,490 --> 01:26:06,590
I couldn't write.
I couldn't even read because I would get

1900
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:08,390
to the end of a sentence.
I couldn't remember the beginning of the

1901
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:11,660
sentence that I read,
but it's like watching yourself go mad.

1902
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:12,793
I don't know of any.
I don't have been through a lot of 

1903
01:26:14,511 --> 01:26:15,344
physical pain.
I've been through a lot of different 

1904
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:16,874
illnesses.
Whatever.

1905
01:26:16,970 --> 01:26:19,040
Nothing is worse than watching yourself 
go crazy.

1906
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:20,060
Wow.
Terrifying.

1907
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:21,800
That.
My good friend,

1908
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:22,634
Tommy,
his girlfriend just this past weekend 

1909
01:26:23,781 --> 01:26:26,870
was telling me about she had lyme and 
she was misdiagnosed.

1910
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:27,943
She had to go to more than a,
I think she said more than a dozen 

1911
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:33,590
different doctors before somebody 
finally listened to her.

1912
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:36,050
If you find,
if my second book west of Jesus,

1913
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:38,240
which is the book I write about this,
this is very early,

1914
01:26:38,241 --> 01:26:43,241
it's the first couple of pages.
I have a list of all the diseases that I

1915
01:26:44,181 --> 01:26:47,840
was told I had before they actually 
discovered was lime and it's,

1916
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:49,980
you know,
it's half a page of diseases.

1917
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:50,813
It's just,
I'm so confused by that because lyme is 

1918
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,820
common.
So first of all I was,

1919
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,050
I had it,
uh,

1920
01:26:57,110 --> 01:26:59,690
I got it on the east coast,
but I was here.

1921
01:26:59,691 --> 01:27:02,660
I was living in California.
I was living in La at the time were they

1922
01:27:02,661 --> 01:27:04,340
hadn't really.
Now they've seen it,

1923
01:27:04,341 --> 01:27:08,060
but at that time nobody had really seen 
it and they didn't believe it was a west

1924
01:27:08,061 --> 01:27:09,360
coast disease and it,
you know,

1925
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:13,610
it's still this point that diagnostics 
are not fantastic for lyme.

1926
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,500
But what I was saying,
my friend Katie,

1927
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:16,880
my friend,
Tommy's girlfriend,

1928
01:27:16,881 --> 01:27:17,714
Katie,
she lives in New Jersey or Connecticut 

1929
01:27:19,461 --> 01:27:21,410
rather,
where it's really common.

1930
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,320
I mean,
line Connecticut is where it came from,

1931
01:27:24,321 --> 01:27:26,990
so they live in a place where it's 
really common and the doctor's like,

1932
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:29,210
nap time.
She was like a thing.

1933
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,770
It might be lime,
not lying.

1934
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,900
You're going crazy.
I went in,

1935
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:35,420
I don't know if I can talk about this.

1936
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,860
I can't talk about this a little bit,
but.

1937
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:37,903
So we'll keep names out of it.
So the first time I walked into see my 

1938
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:43,100
doctor,
um,

1939
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:43,934
I've been sick for awhile and I just 
moved to La so it didn't have or a 

1940
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:49,130
regular practitioner.
I finally got one and I've been sick for

1941
01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:49,964
a while,
so a lot of my friends had been trying 

1942
01:27:50,811 --> 01:27:52,430
to figure out what the hell was going on
me.

1943
01:27:52,431 --> 01:27:54,230
And one of my editors said,
Hey,

1944
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:55,303
I've been doing research.
I think I think we have and go ask your 

1945
01:27:57,081 --> 01:27:59,540
doctor.
And I remember walking into the doctor's

1946
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,580
first time I'd seen him and I was like,
hey man,

1947
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:02,001
I,
you know,

1948
01:28:02,001 --> 01:28:03,170
Blah Blah Blah.
This was going on.

1949
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,970
Uh,
I think I have lyme.

1950
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:05,570
And he's like,
no,

1951
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:06,380
no,
you don't have lyme,

1952
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:09,230
you have aids.
Which by the way,

1953
01:28:09,470 --> 01:28:10,680
like,
you know,

1954
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:11,563
I was like,
are you sure because decided you were 

1955
01:28:13,401 --> 01:28:14,750
gay,
know I looked at him,

1956
01:28:14,751 --> 01:28:15,710
I was like,
are you sure?

1957
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,610
Because my mother was one of the very 
first AIDS activists in Ohio.

1958
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,180
So like I've been having protected sex 
my whole life,

1959
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:28,210
or baby have true that heterosexual,
no intervenous drug use at that time and

1960
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:32,040
you know,
just any dudes,

1961
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:33,020
nothing,
nothing,

1962
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:33,620
nothing,
nothing,

1963
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:34,760
nothing,
nothing at that point.

1964
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:35,594
And you know,
I'm willing to learn if you'll send me 

1965
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:38,160
someplace special.
But uh,

1966
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:42,300
so this guy decided,
this guy just looks at me and the work.

1967
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:43,370
You're gay?
No,

1968
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:45,110
I thought I was like,
I was like,

1969
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:45,944
buddy,
I'm not like I haven't add homosexual 

1970
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:49,490
sex.
I've never used Ivy.

1971
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:56,300
That was what happened.
And the worst thing is like I go home to

1972
01:28:56,301 --> 01:28:58,160
your girlfriend who you're living with.
And she's like,

1973
01:28:58,161 --> 01:29:00,370
how was the doctor honey?
MMM.

1974
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,063
Yeah.

1975
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,220
Did he test you before he tested?
He tested.

1976
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,900
That's just,
that won the lawsuit.

1977
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,961
Oh,
I know.

1978
01:29:07,961 --> 01:29:10,290
By the time it was all said and I'm holy
Shit,

1979
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:11,790
you have to assume,
wow.

1980
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,863
It got really obnoxious,
I mean they wouldn't test me for 

1981
01:29:15,361 --> 01:29:16,194
anything and it dragged on and on and on
that because they're worried that if 

1982
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:20,664
they do test you for something and they 
confirmed that they were incorrect and 

1983
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,730
it sets them up for malpractice so 
they're trying to drag it out and it was

1984
01:29:26,731 --> 01:29:27,460
an Hmo.
Thanks.

1985
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:31,890
So insurance has changed,
but back in this was early $2,000

1986
01:29:31,891 --> 01:29:33,190
a year.
Ninety nine,

1987
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:34,043
98.
I paid my premium was hmo coverage was 

1988
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:38,664
like,
let's say at the time it was like a 

1989
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:42,240
couple of hundred bucks a month of that 
200 bucks a month,

1990
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:46,300
$7 went to the doctor for testing the 
restaurant,

1991
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,010
went to the insurance company,
the doctor got $7 a month to treat me.

1992
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:53,640
Somehow incentivized are that are run a 
bunch of big expensive tests.

1993
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:56,190
So it looks at anybody on an Hmo is like
aids.

1994
01:29:57,100 --> 01:29:58,290
You got a,
you get aids,

1995
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:00,833
get them to run out of my office.
Hopefully the goal just do drugs and 

1996
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:05,460
die,
which is drink himself to death.

1997
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:06,750
It was ugly.
Wow,

1998
01:30:06,751 --> 01:30:07,584
that's crazy.
So this was a long time ago when line 

1999
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:11,573
wasn't nearly as prevalent.
Now with lyme is a God damn scary 

2000
01:30:15,301 --> 01:30:16,134
disease because I don't know when it 
originated and they just started sorta 

2001
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:21,450
treating people for it over the last few
decades.

2002
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:22,320
Right.
I don't,

2003
01:30:22,370 --> 01:30:24,270
um,
I don't know if this is still true,

2004
01:30:24,271 --> 01:30:25,104
but there was a period of time where it 
was the first or the second biggest 

2005
01:30:29,701 --> 01:30:32,880
communicable disease,
your viral diseases in the world.

2006
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,200
I,
it was second to AIDS.

2007
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:35,700
Well,
one of the things I studied,

2008
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,270
I did this show called the Joe Rogan 
questions.

2009
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:40,103
Everything for Psi Phi and one of the 
things that we looked into with 

2010
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:43,473
something called more jealous,
do you know what more jealous or Jones 

2011
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:47,124
is a very controversial disease where 
people feel like they have fibers 

2012
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:53,320
growing out of their skin and they 
scratched themselves and develop these,

2013
01:30:53,321 --> 01:30:54,154
like open sores from itching and then 
they think that they'll get like carpet 

2014
01:30:58,741 --> 01:30:59,574
fibers and their skin.
They'll think it's coming out of their 

2015
01:31:01,021 --> 01:31:01,854
body like they have like fibers from 
their clothes that they'll detect on 

2016
01:31:05,341 --> 01:31:06,174
their skin.
And so it has this sort of weird 

2017
01:31:07,981 --> 01:31:08,814
psychological aspect to it.
What's interesting about it is a 

2018
01:31:11,191 --> 01:31:12,024
disproportionate number of people who 
have more gentleman's or believed they 

2019
01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:17,670
haven't tested positive for lyme 
disease.

2020
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:20,790
So I was talking to a doctor who had 
more jealous,

2021
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:21,624
who also has lyme.
And he was very candid and honest about 

2022
01:31:24,361 --> 01:31:25,194
it.
He and he thinks that there's a direct 

2023
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:28,740
risk,
there's something going on,

2024
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:29,603
there's a neurotoxic effect that's 
happening with the lyme disease that's 

2025
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:35,310
twisting his mind doesn't.

2026
01:31:35,380 --> 01:31:37,740
I mean I went crazy.
I'll tell you I was at.

2027
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:40,620
That's why I wanted to talk to them 
about Fairfax and sunset.

2028
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:42,480
I was driving my car.
It was just stick.

2029
01:31:42,481 --> 01:31:44,100
And it was,
I was coming back from the doctors.

2030
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:47,040
This was a typical lyme.
What happens to your brain?

2031
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:51,330
And I'm the light's red and it's rush 
hour.

2032
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:54,170
You know what Fairfax in sunset is like 
at rush hour and uh,

2033
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:58,740
the light turns from red to green.
And I no longer know what green means.

2034
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,690
My brain is just like.
And I'm like,

2035
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:03,160
what am I supposed to do?
What am I supposed to do?

2036
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:06,430
People are flocking and hugging and 
finally I'm like,

2037
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:08,830
Oh crap.
Green means go,

2038
01:32:09,010 --> 01:32:09,843
and I looked down to the stick shift and
I no longer had not remember how to 

2039
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:12,874
drive stick.
I had to literally get out and people 

2040
01:32:14,471 --> 01:32:15,304
had to push my car into whatever that 
little grocery store is right there to 

2041
01:32:18,671 --> 01:32:19,090
the bar.

2042
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:20,740
You crazy.
So like,

2043
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:21,953
you know,
fundamental skills that I'd had since I 

2044
01:32:22,961 --> 01:32:25,390
was 16 years old.
And you know,

2045
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:27,070
the ability to go when the light turns 
green.

2046
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:30,820
I mean you watch yourself go crazy.
Wow.

2047
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:34,090
That must be insane.
But you knew how to walk.

2048
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:36,550
You knew how to talk.
You knew to say there's something wrong.

2049
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,593
You had full access to the language that
had full access to land that couldn't 

2050
01:32:40,271 --> 01:32:43,240
write.
I started developing like scrabble words

2051
01:32:43,241 --> 01:32:45,400
up when I was writing,
but I could talk.

2052
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:48,490
I don't think I ever lost my powers of 
speech that I remember.

2053
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:51,040
What a scary little fucking disease.
Lyme is,

2054
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,180
was weird,
scary,

2055
01:32:52,181 --> 01:32:53,770
creepy disease.
Well,

2056
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:56,350
this doctor,
he was absolutely convinced that the two

2057
01:32:56,351 --> 01:32:57,184
of them were correlated.
He said that there's something going on 

2058
01:32:58,691 --> 01:32:59,524
with lyme disease that produces this 
thing where you start seeing these 

2059
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:05,620
fibers coming out of your body and uh,
you know,

2060
01:33:05,621 --> 01:33:06,454
we had a ton of people like the sending 
videos and show us images and they had 

2061
01:33:10,511 --> 01:33:12,130
slides that they had prepared.

2062
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:12,963
They were convinced these fibers were 
coming out of their skin and so doctors 

2063
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,920
oftentimes just completely label it as a
psychosomatic disorder.

2064
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,053
But this one doctor who had it said,
I believe that the correlation is lyme 

2065
01:33:25,511 --> 01:33:28,690
disease and it completely makes sense.
Listen to what you're saying.

2066
01:33:29,650 --> 01:33:32,560
The other thing is everything has a 
psychosomatic disease,

2067
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:33,341
right?
I mean,

2068
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:36,440
there's not a wealth of mine.
All I was saying is,

2069
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:40,443
I don't mean it.
That was kind of funny now because it's 

2070
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:45,100
a,
it's like you could kind of avoid.

2071
01:33:45,101 --> 01:33:47,380
It used to be,
we were all worried everybody's going to

2072
01:33:47,381 --> 01:33:49,840
die.
Like you can joke around about aids now,

2073
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:51,570
which is rare,
you know,

2074
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:56,050
if you look at like the time when Magic 
Johnson came out as HIV positive,

2075
01:33:56,051 --> 01:33:57,910
everybody was terrified we're all going 
to die.

2076
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:58,833
You know,
I lost a lot of friends during that 

2077
01:34:00,371 --> 01:34:00,610
period.

2078
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:02,080
I'm sure you,
because they thought you had aids.

2079
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:02,993
No,
because I might have lost some friends 

2080
01:34:06,551 --> 01:34:07,920
that way too.
But uh,

2081
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:09,820
because of the.
Yeah,

2082
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:13,360
yeah.
I mean it was a death sentence for a lot

2083
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:14,560
of people,
you know.

2084
01:34:14,561 --> 01:34:17,320
Um,
I had a guy on who,

2085
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:20,710
um,
is a super controversial character.

2086
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:22,750
He's a biologist at the University of 
California,

2087
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:24,220
Berkeley.
And have you ever heard of him?

2088
01:34:24,221 --> 01:34:27,520
His name's Peter Duesberg.
He's a weird guy,

2089
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:28,410
man,
because I'm,

2090
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:30,220
he's,
first of all,

2091
01:34:30,221 --> 01:34:31,054
his credentials are rock solid.
He's done some amazing work with cancer 

2092
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:35,430
research.
He's in me.

2093
01:34:35,480 --> 01:34:37,910
He's a legitimate tenured biologist.
Right.

2094
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:42,400
And he believes that HIV does not cause 
aids.

2095
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:43,473
He believes that AIDS is,
cause he believes that it's not a 

2096
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:47,884
communicable disease that is caused by 
rampant drug abuse and that people 

2097
01:34:52,151 --> 01:34:53,960
taking crystal meth and,
uh,

2098
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:54,853
amyl nitrate and that in the gay 
community there's so much partying that 

2099
01:34:58,281 --> 01:34:59,930
they're destroying their immune system.

2100
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:00,793
And that's why HIV is showing up.
He believes that HIV is a very weak 

2101
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:04,844
virus and it only shows up in the,
in the immune systems are in the bodies 

2102
01:35:08,031 --> 01:35:10,460
of people who have compromised immune 
systems already,

2103
01:35:10,461 --> 01:35:12,200
that it's not the cause of the immune 
system,

2104
01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:14,960
but it's a symptom of a compromised 
immune system.

2105
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,840
It can't just be because like abuse 
obviously,

2106
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:21,890
because there's tons of people who have 
aids who never used drugs in their life,

2107
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,671
right?
Like Africa,

2108
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:23,930
right?
Yeah.

2109
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:25,310
Right.
Here's what's weird about that.

2110
01:35:25,311 --> 01:35:26,144
They don't test them for HIV.
When you get money from AIDS 

2111
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:29,640
organizations,
um,

2112
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,441
they,
they're not,

2113
01:35:30,441 --> 01:35:33,320
they're not spending a ton of money to 
test people for HIV.

2114
01:35:33,321 --> 01:35:34,760
They're just looking at their t cell 
count.

2115
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,680
They're looking at people with 
compromised immune systems.

2116
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:39,380
Aids meaning acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome.

2117
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:42,560
So they're seeing these people that have
obviously compromised immune systems and

2118
01:35:42,561 --> 01:35:43,460
they look at the t cell count.

2119
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:44,570
Oh yeah,
you have aids,

2120
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,900
but it doesn't mean they have HIV and 
what he.

2121
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:48,763
I mean,
he's fucking super controversial and no 

2122
01:35:51,021 --> 01:35:51,854
one agrees with them and no one wants to
debate him either because I had him on 

2123
01:35:54,351 --> 01:35:55,184
it.
People were really angry with me for 

2124
01:35:55,611 --> 01:35:56,421
having a lawn like,
Hey,

2125
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:57,254
I have zero background in biology.
This guy's a fucking professor at the 

2126
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:01,520
University of California,
Berkeley.

2127
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,930
He's written all these articles about 
it.

2128
01:36:02,931 --> 01:36:04,250
He's talked to all these people about 
it.

2129
01:36:04,251 --> 01:36:07,880
I want to hear what he has to say.
People are so angry at all,

2130
01:36:07,940 --> 01:36:10,550
but as you look into it deeper and 
deeper,

2131
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:13,940
it demands that someone shot them down 
like some.

2132
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:18,410
Some biologist should have a debate with
them and show step by step wise,

2133
01:36:18,411 --> 01:36:20,210
wrong,
because if he's just running around,

2134
01:36:20,211 --> 01:36:22,490
they're saying that and everybody avoids
him.

2135
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:24,710
A lot of people gonna get sucked into 
that rabbit hole.

2136
01:36:25,130 --> 01:36:25,690
You know?
I don't.

2137
01:36:25,690 --> 01:36:27,320
I don't obviously don't know who's 
right.

2138
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:29,120
I doubt he's right.
I highly,

2139
01:36:29,121 --> 01:36:29,954
highly,
highly doubt that all those other 

2140
01:36:31,971 --> 01:36:34,520
biologists are wrong.
And this one guy is correct,

2141
01:36:34,970 --> 01:36:35,803
but it might be both.
It might be that HIV does cause aids at 

2142
01:36:39,441 --> 01:36:44,120
AIDS is a communicable disease and also 
that drug abuse accentuates it.

2143
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:46,310
That makes it much worse.
So instead,

2144
01:36:46,540 --> 01:36:47,373
you know,
he's looking at this one factor when 

2145
01:36:48,951 --> 01:36:49,784
this one factor,
which absolutely everybody knows when 

2146
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:54,770
you're doing crystal meth and you're 
doing a meal nitrate and all these crazy

2147
01:36:54,771 --> 01:36:55,604
drugs,
these people are doing anybody doing 

2148
01:36:57,021 --> 01:36:58,820
that stuff,
you're going to have a fucked up body.

2149
01:36:59,110 --> 01:37:00,610
Like it's going to compromise your 
immune system.

2150
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,660
You drink every night,
it compromises your immune system.

2151
01:37:02,661 --> 01:37:03,494
Any drug abuse is not good.
So if that drug abuse is going on and 

2152
01:37:08,130 --> 01:37:10,880
it's coinciding with an infectious 
disease,

2153
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:13,010
it just makes sense that it would 
accentuate it.

2154
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:16,040
That's what I probably think it is.
But his path,

2155
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:21,340
the path that he's chosen to pursue is 
just extremely controversial.

2156
01:37:21,470 --> 01:37:22,303
And you know,
people think that he's antisemitic and 

2157
01:37:24,001 --> 01:37:27,320
then he's anti gay anti this and anti 
that because of it.

2158
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:28,154
So a lot of,
a lot of weird stuff gets tossed around 

2159
01:37:30,730 --> 01:37:32,640
a crazy.
Yeah.

2160
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:33,561
Interesting.
Yeah.

2161
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:35,260
I'm sure he's wrong.
Dunno.

2162
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:36,163
Fuck.
Do I know.

2163
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:37,123
But for you,
what did they have to do to you to get 

2164
01:37:39,441 --> 01:37:43,370
you off the lyme disease and isn't lyme 
something you keep semi-permanently?

2165
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,440
So I mean,
I,

2166
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,730
you know,
I was in bed for three,

2167
01:37:46,731 --> 01:37:47,564
I mean I'll tell you,
the year it was in bed for about three 

2168
01:37:48,951 --> 01:37:49,784
years,
they had to pull me off antibiotics 

2169
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:53,300
because my stomach lining started 
bleeding out.

2170
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:55,940
There was nothing else maybe you could 
for me and

2171
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:59,820
just tell you the full story and I was 
going to end my life.

2172
01:37:59,821 --> 01:38:01,920
I like,
I was at that point I was functional but

2173
01:38:02,040 --> 01:38:02,873
10 percent of the time,
maybe like an hour a day I couldn't 

2174
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:05,724
work.
The only thing I was going to be was 

2175
01:38:07,171 --> 01:38:09,660
burdening my friends and my family and I
was just like,

2176
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:10,680
alright,
at the time,

2177
01:38:10,710 --> 01:38:14,570
30 m and a in the middle of this,
I was,

2178
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:15,603
it was,
it was when I was still living in Los 

2179
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:17,723
Angeles,
a friend of mine showed up my door and 

2180
01:38:18,631 --> 01:38:21,360
said,
we're going surfing your fucking mind.

2181
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:24,450
I can't walk across the room.
I mean I literally,

2182
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:28,020
I couldn't do it and she wouldn't shut 
up and wouldn't leave,

2183
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:28,953
wouldn't leave and wouldn't leave.
And after like it just hard to make 

2184
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:32,703
compliant.
It's going to drown me four hours of 

2185
01:38:34,861 --> 01:38:36,480
this or three hours.
I was like,

2186
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:38,880
fuck it,
let's go surfing today.

2187
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,560
I mean,
what's the worst that can happen?

2188
01:38:40,561 --> 01:38:41,394
Right?
I'll always kill myself tomorrow and a 

2189
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:44,543
drag matt to sunset beach and they 
literally sort of had to walk me to the 

2190
01:38:47,971 --> 01:38:48,480
car,
right.

2191
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,610
Take you by the shoulders because I was 
really weak and you know,

2192
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:54,000
they gave me a board the size of a 
Cadillac and the bigger the board,

2193
01:38:54,001 --> 01:38:56,850
the easier it is to serve and this was 
enormous and it was a tiny day.

2194
01:38:56,851 --> 01:39:00,210
Like waves were like two feet at best 
and it was so crappy.

2195
01:39:00,211 --> 01:39:01,044
Nobody was even out,
but the water was warm and they sort of 

2196
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:03,744
like,
they took me by the elbow and they 

2197
01:39:03,961 --> 01:39:04,794
walked me out to the break and I was out
there and I knew how to surf a little 

2198
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:09,060
bit.
Had been a long time side surfed at that

2199
01:39:09,061 --> 01:39:12,170
point,
but 30 seconds later a wave came in.

2200
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:13,320
You know,
I don't know what happened.

2201
01:39:13,321 --> 01:39:14,430
Muscle memory took over,
whatever.

2202
01:39:14,431 --> 01:39:17,040
But I spun my board.
I paddled a couple of times and I popped

2203
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:20,400
up and I just popped up in a dimension I
didn't even know existed.

2204
01:39:20,401 --> 01:39:21,234
Right.
So in the eye panoramic vision I felt 

2205
01:39:22,711 --> 01:39:27,680
like I could see out of the back of my 
head and I felt amazing.

2206
01:39:28,030 --> 01:39:31,920
Felt like that kind of full throttle of 
lifetime and slowed down.

2207
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:34,200
None of it made any sense.
It felt so good.

2208
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:37,310
I caught like four more waves that day 
and by the fifth wave I was,

2209
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:40,680
I was disassembled it Kinda put me back 
into the car and drove me home.

2210
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:45,040
And uh,
I was so sick after that that I was,

2211
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:45,933
I got into bed and people had to bring 
me food for like two weeks because I 

2212
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:51,810
couldn't walk to my kitchen which is 
like 60 feet away and I was exhausted.

2213
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:56,130
But on the Fifteenth Day,
which the day I could walk again,

2214
01:39:56,910 --> 01:40:00,690
caught another ride back to the beach 
and I did it again and again.

2215
01:40:00,691 --> 01:40:03,600
I had this crazy altered state of 
consciousness experience.

2216
01:40:03,601 --> 01:40:04,710
And you know,
again,

2217
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:05,544
I was disassembled this time.
Maybe it was like 13 days that I was in 

2218
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:11,230
bed and I did it again and over the 
course of about six to eight months with

2219
01:40:11,231 --> 01:40:13,650
the only thing I was doing differently 
in my life was surfing.

2220
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:14,843
I went from about 10 percent 
functionality to about 80 percent 

2221
01:40:17,311 --> 01:40:18,144
functionality.
So my first question is the fuck is 

2222
01:40:20,611 --> 01:40:21,361
going on,
right?

2223
01:40:21,361 --> 01:40:22,194
Like as I said earlier,
surfing is not a known cure for chronic 

2224
01:40:25,261 --> 01:40:26,310
autoimmune.
Right?

2225
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:27,653
So I laid out on a John Question.
The other thing was I backgrounds is a 

2226
01:40:31,531 --> 01:40:32,364
science writer,
so like I don't have quasi mystical 

2227
01:40:35,371 --> 01:40:38,250
experiences and I sure as hell don't 
have them while surfing,

2228
01:40:38,251 --> 01:40:41,130
which has got to be the flakest thing 
ever.

2229
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:45,120
And I'm so.
I really believed that even though I was

2230
01:40:45,121 --> 01:40:45,954
feeling better lives,
only fatal if it gets into your brain 

2231
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:50,730
and I was.
I was pretty sure that even though I was

2232
01:40:50,731 --> 01:40:51,564
starting to feel physically better that 
the disease had crept into my brain 

2233
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:57,220
because why else would I be having these
mystical experiences?

2234
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:00,220
I must be totally losing my mind about 
to die.

2235
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:04,660
And I lit out on a giant quest beer.
At what the hell happened and you know,

2236
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:08,260
very quickly discovered that these 
states of consciousness have names.

2237
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:09,094
We called them flow states and the 
version of what happened to me health 

2238
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:13,174
wise,
and this is her Benson did some of the 

2239
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:17,650
work on the neurobiology of this.
He's at Harvard,

2240
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:19,810
he wrote about it in his book,
the breakout principle,

2241
01:41:19,811 --> 01:41:20,644
but uh,
all the neurochemicals that show up in 

2242
01:41:23,871 --> 01:41:25,030
flow to things happen.

2243
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:27,160
So one,
when you move into flow,

2244
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,320
there's a global release of nitric 
oxide.

2245
01:41:29,321 --> 01:41:31,570
It's a gas as signaling molecules 
anywhere in the body.

2246
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:32,433
What it does is it flushes all the 
stress hormones out of your system and 

2247
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:37,960
it pumps you full of these kind of feel 
good performance.

2248
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:42,980
Tangent line is an essentially any 
autoimmune conditions you nervous system

2249
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:46,060
gone haywire.
So when you go into flow,

2250
01:41:46,061 --> 01:41:47,620
it resets.
Your nervous system,

2251
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:50,950
calms everything down.
It gets rid of all the stress hormones,

2252
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,960
all that stuff and it.
And when.

2253
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:56,170
The worst part about lyme is you don't 
even know what normal is.

2254
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:59,560
Like it has been so long since you have 
felt normal,

2255
01:41:59,561 --> 01:42:01,540
like you don't even.
You can't even find it on a map,

2256
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,400
so suddenly like I was like,
oh,

2257
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:05,410
this is what normal feels like.
Again,

2258
01:42:05,411 --> 01:42:06,820
the other thing is,
you know,

2259
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:09,510
the positive neurochemicals that show up
and float dopamine,

2260
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:12,190
Serotonin and Nanda [inaudible] see 
towson.

2261
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:15,040
Those are all immune system boosters.
I mean they do a ton of other stuff,

2262
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:16,540
enhance cognitive performance and 
whatever,

2263
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:19,930
but her Benson at Harvard,
and I think this may be overstretching,

2264
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:20,773
it will have a budget,
but he has kind of gone on record and 

2265
01:42:23,741 --> 01:42:28,741
said he thinks most cases of so called 
spontaneous healing actually have a flow

2266
01:42:29,231 --> 01:42:31,960
state at their heart and it's this 
particular process that's doing it.

2267
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:34,270
Wow.
It almost.

2268
01:42:34,410 --> 01:42:37,080
It makes sense if you look at it,
look at the opposite,

2269
01:42:37,081 --> 01:42:37,530
right?
What?

2270
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:40,590
What is the big diminisher of people's 
health?

2271
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:42,600
It's stress,
right?

2272
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:46,560
It's stress and depression,
bad feelings,

2273
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:50,850
and it's always followed by degrading of
the immune system.

2274
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,060
Health goes poor.
That totally makes sense.

2275
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:55,103
If you're happy and either achieve that.
That's what I meant earlier when I said 

2276
01:42:57,151 --> 01:42:58,800
every disease is psychosomatic,
right?

2277
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:00,990
Like I'm not saying there aren't 
physical causes,

2278
01:43:01,290 --> 01:43:02,210
but like,
you know,

2279
01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:02,780
whatever

2280
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:06,650
I used to think about the mind body 
split is absolute complete nonsense,

2281
01:43:06,651 --> 01:43:08,930
right?
We now know that there's as many kind of

2282
01:43:08,931 --> 01:43:11,770
neurons in your heart and your stomach 
as you had in your brain until

2283
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,330
body system.
Yeah.

2284
01:43:13,340 --> 01:43:14,173
I'm sure you have concentrated on 
probiotics and the probiotics have 

2285
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:21,980
unconsciousness and the way you feel way
I feel.

2286
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,810
Yes.
Consciousness.

2287
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,060
How they think it even forms your 
personality.

2288
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:27,770
That's interesting.
The microbiome.

2289
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:28,240
Yeah.

2290
01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,020
Well,
one thing.

2291
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:31,320
So you know,
candy,

2292
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,120
which is another one of those diseases 
nobody believes you have.

2293
01:43:34,320 --> 01:43:35,153
Um,
when you're on antibiotics for three 

2294
01:43:36,701 --> 01:43:37,534
years,
you've totally throw off the human 

2295
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:41,960
microbiome.
And one of the things that happens when,

2296
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:44,350
when candidate,
when you get overrun by yeast,

2297
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:46,840
right,
is you get extremely,

2298
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:49,210
extremely anxious and paranoid.
Why?

2299
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:52,370
Because yeast feeds on sugar,
which is fast

2300
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:53,203
energy.
So if I make you super anxious and 

2301
01:43:54,531 --> 01:43:55,364
paranoid,
you're gonna want to eat sugar because 

2302
01:43:57,111 --> 01:43:57,944
you're going to want the fast energy 
because you might have to fight or do 

2303
01:43:59,811 --> 01:44:00,644
something so you can get taken over.
It's a chemical imbalance and it makes 

2304
01:44:05,001 --> 01:44:08,810
you paranoid and anxious.
And what it really is is is the east set

2305
01:44:08,811 --> 01:44:09,644
craving sugar,
but it totally takes over your 

2306
01:44:11,691 --> 01:44:12,524
consciousness and I always thought that 
was interesting because if you were to 

2307
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:16,190
really poke at people and you're like,
well,

2308
01:44:16,191 --> 01:44:17,960
what is really you?
What is the,

2309
01:44:17,990 --> 01:44:18,823
what do you see?
They're gunna often come back to their 

2310
01:44:21,111 --> 01:44:23,090
emotions.
Will I am my emotions?

2311
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:24,103
Right?
And here's this tilting your microbiome 

2312
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:26,983
with.
The first thing that happens is they 

2313
01:44:27,381 --> 01:44:29,240
hijack your emotions,
right?

2314
01:44:29,241 --> 01:44:30,074
So it can get the food at once,
but you're definitely not completely in 

2315
01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:34,340
control of your emotions.

2316
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:36,140
What's so difficult?
When we look in the mirror,

2317
01:44:36,141 --> 01:44:38,330
we see an individual,
we see a unique thing,

2318
01:44:38,331 --> 01:44:40,240
but what we are is we're not.
Yeah,

2319
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:41,120
you're a hybrid.
Yeah.

2320
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:41,631
Yeah,
I will.

2321
01:44:41,631 --> 01:44:43,550
I mean,
so one of the questions,

2322
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:44,780
and nobody has an answer to this 
question,

2323
01:44:44,781 --> 01:44:45,920
but I think it's really,
really neat,

2324
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:48,410
so if you study flow,
if you study optimal performance,

2325
01:44:48,590 --> 01:44:49,970
and I've been asking people this 
question,

2326
01:44:49,971 --> 01:44:50,781
well,
okay,

2327
01:44:50,781 --> 01:44:54,170
I can tell you how it works in the brain
for sure and some of the body,

2328
01:44:54,171 --> 01:44:58,280
but like if I'm going to drop into flow,
does my microbiome help?

2329
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:02,240
Is it's a collective experience or if 
it's optimal performance,

2330
01:45:02,241 --> 01:45:03,074
is it everything in the system?
Nobody can even start to poke at those 

2331
01:45:06,111 --> 01:45:06,944
questions but would super interesting to
me if they think it affects your 

2332
01:45:08,751 --> 01:45:09,584
personality and they think it affects 
your moods and it they think it effects 

2333
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,720
your intelligence level,
your Iq level.

2334
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:15,553
I mean there's,
there's all these new things are 

2335
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:20,420
constantly correlating on a daily basis 
with your gut biome,

2336
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:23,960
the mean and,
and taking in probiotics.

2337
01:45:24,230 --> 01:45:25,063
For me it's,
it's vastly improved my sick to healthy 

2338
01:45:28,671 --> 01:45:29,380
days.
Oh yeah.

2339
01:45:29,380 --> 01:45:33,020
That for sure that for sure without yet 
without a question.

2340
01:45:33,230 --> 01:45:36,440
No question whatsoever.
Once I started eating Kimchi,

2341
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:38,780
the Kimchi is a big one for me.
I eat that stuff all the time.

2342
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:42,290
I drink Kombucha daily every day.
I drink that stuff.

2343
01:45:42,291 --> 01:45:47,291
I eat a lot of yogurt and I'm constantly
taking in different kinds of probiotics.

2344
01:45:47,730 --> 01:45:48,563
Once I started,
they also did this thing called total 

2345
01:45:50,841 --> 01:45:52,210
gut health.
It's an audit,

2346
01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:53,113
a thing that we sell.
I just try to get as many different 

2347
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:56,864
forms of probiotics and as possible and 
because of that I'm fucking constantly 

2348
01:45:59,991 --> 01:46:01,400
traveling.
I travel constantly.

2349
01:46:01,401 --> 01:46:02,234
I rarely get sick and if I do it's like 
a day or two and then it's gone and I 

2350
01:46:06,331 --> 01:46:06,780
really.

2351
01:46:06,780 --> 01:46:08,690
I credit.
I think it's the probiotics.

2352
01:46:08,691 --> 01:46:12,080
I think it's Kimchi and Kombucha.
I think those are two big ones.

2353
01:46:12,140 --> 01:46:15,860
I also noticed in this could we meet 
talking about but because there might be

2354
01:46:15,861 --> 01:46:16,694
no science here,
but I stopped once I started taking 

2355
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,680
probiotics regularly.
I stopped tearing things as much,

2356
01:46:21,681 --> 01:46:25,460
tearing muscles for whatever reason,
and I could be done to the core of that.

2357
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:27,620
I've never read anything about it,
but it's one thing that I noticed.

2358
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,820
Maybe you're just not doing stupid shit.
Maybe you're not as anxious.

2359
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:32,930
Oh No,
I'm doing stupid shit.

2360
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:35,630
That doesn't stop.
Yeah.

2361
01:46:35,631 --> 01:46:36,464
I wonder,
man,

2362
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:37,460
I just,
it's,

2363
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,130
it is incredible to think of yourself as
a community.

2364
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:43,370
It's incredible to think of yourself as 
some sort of a weird ecosystem.

2365
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:44,810
I read an article.
I think you could.

2366
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:46,200
I think it's unfair.
Yeah.

2367
01:46:46,220 --> 01:46:48,980
I think it's on Forbes that I wrote a 
called you or not you.

2368
01:46:49,260 --> 01:46:50,190
Is that on your website

2369
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,590
now?
But it was an article I wrote for my,

2370
01:46:52,591 --> 01:46:53,790
for my blog.
So if you go to,

2371
01:46:53,791 --> 01:46:57,060
I wrote a blog for Forbes for like four 
or five years called far from tears.

2372
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,273
Um,
and I think the piece is called you are 

2373
01:47:00,330 --> 01:47:03,210
not you,
but it wasn't until recently that we had

2374
01:47:03,211 --> 01:47:04,044
the knowledge to understand this and 
also the time to actually sit down and 

2375
01:47:07,201 --> 01:47:09,930
contemplate it.
Most people for the last,

2376
01:47:09,931 --> 01:47:11,040
you know,
whatever,

2377
01:47:11,041 --> 01:47:12,780
100,000
years people have been people.

2378
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:18,290
It's been a fucking tooth and nail claw,
the struggle to stay alive.

2379
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:21,360
You haven't had time to contemplate on 
your gut biome,

2380
01:47:21,780 --> 01:47:22,613
you know,
this is all like really new stuff to 

2381
01:47:23,851 --> 01:47:25,830
human beings for us to be even 
considering.

2382
01:47:25,831 --> 01:47:26,664
So are cemented observations and ideas 
of who we are now being challenged by 

2383
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:32,544
this notion that no,
there's a community of fucking weird 

2384
01:47:35,281 --> 01:47:37,350
bacteria that you need.

2385
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:40,980
Like that's the thing that kills you the
most about those antibiotics.

2386
01:47:40,981 --> 01:47:42,850
Right?
It kills all the good stuff too.

2387
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:45,490
Like you feel like,
well that was A.

2388
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:46,051
Yeah.
No,

2389
01:47:46,051 --> 01:47:46,884
I mean I,
I often think that one of the hardest 

2390
01:47:48,601 --> 01:47:49,434
parts,
I'm sure this happens with a lot of 

2391
01:47:50,101 --> 01:47:50,934
other diseases,
but I've noticed it with lime and I've 

2392
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:57,180
talked to a lot of other lyme patients,
is the antibiotics fuck you up so much.

2393
01:47:57,181 --> 01:48:00,780
And they mimic when your microbiome gets
that scurry,

2394
01:48:00,781 --> 01:48:05,781
it mimics the symptoms of lyme.
So sometimes you can't even tell you the

2395
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:07,980
antibiotics actually might be making you
feel better,

2396
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:10,590
but you can't tell the lie.
Maybe dying not,

2397
01:48:10,591 --> 01:48:11,424
but you still feel so crappy because of 
what the antibiotics have done to your 

2398
01:48:13,621 --> 01:48:16,170
symptoms and it feels like the same kind
of ailment.

2399
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,393
Whoa,

2400
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:19,763
wow.
I had staff a few years back and I took 

2401
01:48:21,511 --> 01:48:24,520
a really strong antibiotic for it.
And uh,

2402
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,030
the first thing I felt like was a light 
headed.

2403
01:48:27,031 --> 01:48:28,500
And weak,
I was like,

2404
01:48:28,501 --> 01:48:32,640
this is a weird feeling.
I just felt really like,

2405
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:35,430
how long were you on antibiotics?
I don't remember.

2406
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,620
It wasn't that long because I caught it 
really early.

2407
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:39,510
My friend take caught it.
I was super lucky.

2408
01:48:39,511 --> 01:48:40,344
We were at the airport and I was wearing
shorts and he just looked down at my 

2409
01:48:42,031 --> 01:48:43,950
calf and he's like,
what's that on your leg?

2410
01:48:44,130 --> 01:48:44,963
And I go,
no.

2411
01:48:45,250 --> 01:48:46,800
And he goes,
it got a little zip seals,

2412
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:47,491
little zits.
I go,

2413
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:47,941
yeah.
He goes,

2414
01:48:47,941 --> 01:48:50,070
I think you have staff like,
are you fucking serious?

2415
01:48:50,420 --> 01:48:51,660
I go,
it's just like little zits.

2416
01:48:51,661 --> 01:48:52,560
He's like,
go get it.

2417
01:48:52,561 --> 01:48:53,700
Checked out.
It checked out.

2418
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:54,990
Yep.
Staff immediately,

2419
01:48:55,020 --> 01:48:55,853
boom.
Antibiotics and when it was gone pretty 

2420
01:48:58,771 --> 01:48:59,730
far pretty quickly.

2421
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,420
But I remember feeling like a shell for 
four weeks.

2422
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:05,790
I just felt like,
like there was like,

2423
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:06,983
I was probably down to like 50 or 60 
percent of what I used to be until it 

2424
01:49:10,081 --> 01:49:13,860
all sort of built back up.
But luckily I was super on the ball when

2425
01:49:13,861 --> 01:49:14,694
it comes to probiotics and replenishing 
my gut biome because I know some people 

2426
01:49:18,181 --> 01:49:21,480
that just don't know.
They just sort of try to keep on keeping

2427
01:49:21,481 --> 01:49:22,314
on and you know,
you're eating cheeseburgers and fries 

2428
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:25,374
and you don't ever get probiotics in 
your system and your gut biome suffers 

2429
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:29,603
and you know,
you go on this sort of spiral of 

2430
01:49:31,801 --> 01:49:33,870
deterioration because of that.
Health wise

2431
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:36,950
it's critical.
We did that.

2432
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:38,053
So why did your lyme gets so bad?
Like I've never heard of anybody having 

2433
01:49:42,221 --> 01:49:44,710
it for three years like that.
Well it took them,

2434
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:48,610
I don't know,
so it took them almost a year

2435
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:51,010
to find it.
So that's really what it is.

2436
01:49:51,011 --> 01:49:53,020
It's how long do you have it before you 
get there?

2437
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:55,390
So it took them,
you know,

2438
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:57,880
I,
I was tested for everything because they

2439
01:49:57,881 --> 01:49:58,900
just didn't like the guy,
you know,

2440
01:49:59,000 --> 01:49:59,833
the guy didn't believe I have line.
Nobody believed that I had lyme since 

2441
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:02,710
the AIDS guy.
The same guy.

2442
01:50:02,711 --> 01:50:04,540
Same Guy.
You didn't get a second opinion.

2443
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:05,750
I was,
it was,

2444
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:07,840
was 30.
I was poor.

2445
01:50:07,841 --> 01:50:08,780
I didn't have,
I always say this,

2446
01:50:08,830 --> 01:50:10,240
my healthcare,
this was my doctor that,

2447
01:50:10,241 --> 01:50:11,770
you know,
fuck.

2448
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:15,100
Wow.
So because of that,

2449
01:50:15,130 --> 01:50:17,350
because by the way I did when I finally 
was like,

2450
01:50:17,351 --> 01:50:19,330
okay,
I gotta like just go out and network and

2451
01:50:19,331 --> 01:50:21,760
find infectious disease doctor.
I remember walking in,

2452
01:50:21,761 --> 01:50:23,110
I told him all my symptoms and I was 
like,

2453
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:25,770
you don't think I'm crazy,
do you like I,

2454
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:27,490
I'm certainly wondering my 
hypochondriac.

2455
01:50:27,490 --> 01:50:28,780
Am I making this shit up?
Like,

2456
01:50:28,781 --> 01:50:30,490
what's going on?
He looked right at me and said,

2457
01:50:30,491 --> 01:50:31,480
no,
I don't think you're making it up.

2458
01:50:31,481 --> 01:50:33,010
I think you have lyme.
Let's test you for it.

2459
01:50:33,110 --> 01:50:35,680
And sure enough.
So did you call the other guy up and go,

2460
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:36,520
hey,
fuck face,

2461
01:50:36,521 --> 01:50:39,130
I don't have aids.
Something like that.

2462
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:41,640
I'd be so mad.
Yeah.

2463
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:44,230
I mean the incentive of someone getting 
$77,

2464
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:45,730
$7 to treat you,
you know,

2465
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:48,310
not a lot.
So they put you on.

2466
01:50:48,311 --> 01:50:49,144
Yeah,
I blame the insurance company is much 

2467
01:50:49,901 --> 01:50:51,850
more than the doctors on that one.
I'm sure.

2468
01:50:52,540 --> 01:50:54,580
So they put you on these hardcore 
antibiotics.

2469
01:50:54,830 --> 01:50:55,663
Um,
and I mean how is that how one year 

2470
01:50:58,601 --> 01:51:00,940
without diagnosing become two years of 
treatment?

2471
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:02,550
Well,
it,

2472
01:51:03,820 --> 01:51:07,150
I couldn't get better.
I just was not getting better.

2473
01:51:07,151 --> 01:51:07,541
I,
in fact,

2474
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:09,370
I got,
even after they found it,

2475
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:10,000
I,
you know,

2476
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:10,833
it took me a long,
I was probably on the antibiotics for 

2477
01:51:13,601 --> 01:51:14,434
like four or five months before I even 
started getting made it to the better 

2478
01:51:19,541 --> 01:51:21,310
and then yeah,
it was just a long,

2479
01:51:21,311 --> 01:51:23,650
slow process that scares the shit out of
me.

2480
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:25,450
That's all coming from a tick.

2481
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:28,750
A buddy of mine,
his,

2482
01:51:28,751 --> 01:51:30,130
um,
his son got it.

2483
01:51:30,131 --> 01:51:32,380
And is the same thing.
Took him to a pediatrician.

2484
01:51:32,381 --> 01:51:33,460
Not,
I don't think so.

2485
01:51:33,461 --> 01:51:36,310
I don't think it's long and he starts 
getting bell's Palsy.

2486
01:51:36,311 --> 01:51:40,420
We're half his face was paralyzed and 
then finally they test them for it.

2487
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:42,260
It's interesting.
I met a,

2488
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:43,440
a uh,
uh,

2489
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:45,070
uh,
I guess this happens,

2490
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:47,560
you know,
it produces really bad arthritis,

2491
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,830
right?
Um,

2492
01:51:49,330 --> 01:51:50,163
but,
and I guess it can go either it gets 

2493
01:51:51,611 --> 01:51:52,444
into your,
it goes either towards your brain or in 

2494
01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:55,414
that direction.
But I'm,

2495
01:51:55,450 --> 01:51:57,250
I met a woman.
Beautiful,

2496
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:58,420
beautiful,
beautiful.

2497
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,020
Probably late twenties.
But if you looked at her hands,

2498
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:04,360
look like they had the hands of like a 
hundred year old woman.

2499
01:52:04,361 --> 01:52:07,360
Her fingers had literally twisted almost
into circles.

2500
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:10,120
I'd never seen anything like it.
It was insane.

2501
01:52:10,480 --> 01:52:11,900
And again it was,
it was,

2502
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:14,740
it was live.
It was really a strange thing.

2503
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:17,380
How long did she have it before the same
kind of thing.

2504
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:19,733
God Damn.
So now you don't suffer any 

2505
01:52:20,561 --> 01:52:21,670
repercussions?
No,

2506
01:52:21,671 --> 01:52:26,080
I'm one of the,
I've totally back to normal.

2507
01:52:26,081 --> 01:52:26,531
I,
you know,

2508
01:52:26,531 --> 01:52:28,170
a lot of people,
um,

2509
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:30,080
don't ever recover.
I,

2510
01:52:30,100 --> 01:52:30,933
it took me,
so it was the surfing and the flow and 

2511
01:52:33,011 --> 01:52:35,500
all that.
All that work got me back to about 80.

2512
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:40,740
It took a long time to go from 80 all 
the way to 100 percent and I worked with

2513
01:52:41,861 --> 01:52:43,260
Mark Gordon then.
So we,

2514
01:52:43,290 --> 01:52:43,990
we,
we,

2515
01:52:43,990 --> 01:52:44,680
you know,
I always,

2516
01:52:44,680 --> 01:52:46,070
people always ask,
what did you

2517
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,760
do to,
to caroline,

2518
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,080
can I use your protocol?
And I'm like,

2519
01:52:48,081 --> 01:52:49,580
you won't do it.
And people like,

2520
01:52:49,581 --> 01:52:50,271
what do you mean?
I was like,

2521
01:52:50,271 --> 01:52:52,370
well,
I used action sports and flow states.

2522
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:53,923
I took steroids and medical marijuana 
and those were the three things that 

2523
01:52:57,590 --> 01:52:59,900
really worked for me.
So steroids,

2524
01:52:59,901 --> 01:53:03,410
pot and action sports,
that's like a party man.

2525
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:06,170
Magic healing protocol for lyme.
Um,

2526
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,530
so what other,
was it just the surfing or what other,

2527
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,060
um,
action sports.

2528
01:53:11,061 --> 01:53:14,330
Did you engage in the put in the truck 
at the time it was mostly,

2529
01:53:14,331 --> 01:53:16,550
it was mostly surfing though.
I was doing,

2530
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:17,021
uh,
uh,

2531
01:53:17,021 --> 01:53:17,854
you know,
as I was recovering after like the 

2532
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:20,654
surfing was what I was doing and it 
would knock me on my ass for a long 

2533
01:53:22,611 --> 01:53:24,650
time,
but after I started to get a little more

2534
01:53:25,070 --> 01:53:26,090
physical,
I started,

2535
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:27,440
um,
you know,

2536
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:28,274
I was,
I would do long hikes with my dog 

2537
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:31,633
through the woods,
which to me will produce a low grade 

2538
01:53:33,201 --> 01:53:34,220
flow state for sure.

2539
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:37,190
Being out in nature obviously does that 
to me a lot.

2540
01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:39,620
Um,
and being with being with my dog at that

2541
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:41,750
time did it.
So there was that also,

2542
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:47,390
once I got enough of my brain back and I
started writing at that point it was,

2543
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:49,370
I was writing the west to Jesus when my 
second book,

2544
01:53:49,371 --> 01:53:51,050
which was the book that sort of covered 
this,

2545
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:54,920
a little bit of this stuff that started 
producing massive amounts of flow.

2546
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:57,680
One of the things about flow is the more
flow you have,

2547
01:53:57,681 --> 01:53:58,514
the more flow you haven't float will 
cross domains if you end up with a lot 

2548
01:54:01,191 --> 01:54:03,830
of flow while surfing or fighting or 
whatever,

2549
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:08,330
it'll start bleeding into your other 
work because it's just a focusing skill,

2550
01:54:08,331 --> 01:54:09,164
right?
It's training the brain to focus in a 

2551
01:54:10,131 --> 01:54:13,970
particular way and you can train it up 
so the more flow you have,

2552
01:54:13,971 --> 01:54:14,990
the more flow you have.

2553
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:16,123
So those used boots and performance that
you start getting in surfing will start 

2554
01:54:18,351 --> 01:54:20,330
bleeding into your writing.
And suddenly,

2555
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:21,353
you know,
everything in my life just started 

2556
01:54:22,161 --> 01:54:24,800
clicking in the writing started 
producing a lot of flow.

2557
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:25,853
Um,
and eventually I started skiing has 

2558
01:54:30,111 --> 01:54:31,220
always been my,
my,

2559
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,113
my core deep sport.
But that it took a while till I was 

2560
01:54:35,151 --> 01:54:35,984
strong enough.
It's a hell of a lot easier to ride a 

2561
01:54:37,630 --> 01:54:38,463
long board in the waves and it is to try
to go hurdling down a mountain on skis 

2562
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:42,553
really isn't for me.
It was for me in terms of energy 

2563
01:54:44,481 --> 01:54:45,980
expenditure.
I can't speak for everybody else,

2564
01:54:45,981 --> 01:54:47,120
but for me,
um,

2565
01:54:47,330 --> 01:54:48,163
because I already knew how to surf.
I didn't have to learn how to surf and 

2566
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:51,920
once you know how to surf,
riding a long board,

2567
01:54:51,921 --> 01:54:54,880
especially if you're writing super 
friendly wave,

2568
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:56,870
sunset or Malibu,
places like that.

2569
01:54:57,230 --> 01:54:57,920
Not

2570
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:00,590
severely taxing.
I've never served,

2571
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:04,580
but have always been compelled or just 
there's something about it being on that

2572
01:55:04,581 --> 01:55:06,980
water and it's grieving and its own 
thing,

2573
01:55:06,981 --> 01:55:09,590
but the whole monsters in the water 
thing.

2574
01:55:09,890 --> 01:55:10,723
I can't get over that to everybody.
It's amazing how many people have this 

2575
01:55:14,061 --> 01:55:16,770
phobia.
It is astounding how many people are.

2576
01:55:16,771 --> 01:55:20,000
We're afraid of sharks.
Where do you think that comes from?

2577
01:55:20,030 --> 01:55:21,260
The fucking sharks,
man.

2578
01:55:21,261 --> 01:55:23,810
That's what it comes from.
This is millions of them.

2579
01:55:23,811 --> 01:55:25,010
They're out there fucking swimming 
around.

2580
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:30,020
You're getting hit by lightening are 
greater than getting eaten by a shark.

2581
01:55:30,381 --> 01:55:31,214
Next time you say that to someone,
I want you to recognize that your 

2582
01:55:33,201 --> 01:55:35,480
chances of getting eaten by a shark or 
zero,

2583
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:37,550
if you don't go in the ocean,
zero,

2584
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:40,520
zero percent,
it will never fucking happened,

2585
01:55:40,521 --> 01:55:42,770
but that's one thing you never have to 
worry about.

2586
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,070
Very few things

2587
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:49,050
on this planet that feel as good or as 
uniquely good as surfing.

2588
01:55:49,051 --> 01:55:53,250
Believe you and you'll never get that 
experience for an experience junkie such

2589
01:55:53,251 --> 01:55:54,780
as yourself.
I don't know about that,

2590
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:56,460
man.
I think you're missing something.

2591
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:58,410
Might be right.
You might be right,

2592
01:55:58,411 --> 01:56:01,020
but I ain't skydiving.
I have a buddy of mine who's a fucking.

2593
01:56:01,021 --> 01:56:03,300
He does one of those squirrel suits from
Andy.

2594
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:05,340
He's always sending me videos.
Is Crazy.

2595
01:56:05,341 --> 01:56:06,480
Fuck.
He's like,

2596
01:56:06,481 --> 01:56:07,314
he holds the world record.
Doesn't hold the world record for like 

2597
01:56:08,521 --> 01:56:11,700
the longest.
A squirrel fucking flying squirrel.

2598
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:14,280
Suit jumping.
He's crazy.

2599
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:16,900
I think that's the official term to 
fucking squirrels.

2600
01:56:17,370 --> 01:56:19,520
But he's a.
he's a legit wildman.

2601
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:23,150
What's Sandy's last name?
Stump former navy seal and you know,

2602
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:24,083
he,
he's just super type a Alpha needs that 

2603
01:56:27,571 --> 01:56:31,320
risk and he sends me videos of him with 
a gopro looking down.

2604
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,420
What does this area.
Yeah,

2605
01:56:34,100 --> 01:56:35,200
18 miles.
Yeah.

2606
01:56:35,460 --> 01:56:37,410
What in the fuck.
Eighteen miles.

2607
01:56:37,411 --> 01:56:39,810
Come on son.
That's awesome.

2608
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:44,760
He sent me a video the other day of him 
like looking over the edge of a cliff,

2609
01:56:44,761 --> 01:56:48,630
like from his perspective,
and then he just slowly tips forward and

2610
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:51,300
jumps off of it and starts flying.
You're like,

2611
01:56:51,301 --> 01:56:53,670
fuck that.
I threw my phone across the room,

2612
01:56:53,671 --> 01:56:55,080
like,
I don't even want to look at that man.

2613
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,880
Like,
why do you do that?

2614
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,270
You know,
it must be fun.

2615
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,770
Must Be.
Well,

2616
01:57:01,771 --> 01:57:02,604
it's.
I mean,

2617
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:03,970
you know,
Dean Potter before it,

2618
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:06,120
before he died,
he was a climber and a,

2619
01:57:06,121 --> 01:57:08,340
uh,
another wind suit guy and he,

2620
01:57:08,450 --> 01:57:09,220
you know,
he died.

2621
01:57:09,220 --> 01:57:10,890
See the guy that slammed into the 
bridge,

2622
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:12,150
not the bridge.
Oh,

2623
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:15,360
body slamming into a notch,
a notch and rock.

2624
01:57:15,361 --> 01:57:17,670
And he was flying.
It was a new cemetery.

2625
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:20,820
He slammed into a cliff called lost 
brother.

2626
01:57:20,821 --> 01:57:25,590
I want to say fast.
Were you going terminal velocity?

2627
01:57:25,770 --> 01:57:28,740
So 30,
3,140

2628
01:57:28,830 --> 01:57:32,310
miles an hour is coming to holy shit.
Wrong.

2629
01:57:32,311 --> 01:57:34,980
Why they call it terminal velocity 
because everybody dies.

2630
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:38,490
Is that what they call a terminal?
That maximum that you can.

2631
01:57:38,590 --> 01:57:40,470
You can hit it.
Oh,

2632
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:43,050
if you're not a pair of Jean Falcon.
Exactly.

2633
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:45,680
Is this handy?
Fucking crazy asshole.

2634
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:46,583
Look at this.

2635
01:57:48,330 --> 01:57:50,370
God Damn.
That must be fun though,

2636
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:51,530
right?
Would you that?

2637
01:57:52,430 --> 01:57:53,490
Yeah,
I've skydived before.

2638
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:56,550
What'd you do this?
A hesitation.

2639
01:57:57,330 --> 01:57:58,163
The hesitation.
So it's only because I'm married and I 

2640
01:58:02,911 --> 01:58:07,040
run a dog that like when I get cancer.
Hail,

2641
01:58:07,041 --> 01:58:09,330
yes,
you won't just cure it with flow state.

2642
01:58:09,460 --> 01:58:11,280
I May,
but you're not going to give that.

2643
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:14,940
And by the way,
if you know that's a beaut flow trigger.

2644
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:15,953
Oh,
I want to flip one like crazy when 

2645
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:20,430
you're flying 18 miles and a squirrel 
suit,

2646
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:24,410
we now know there we think there are,
we know of 20 flow triggers right there.

2647
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:25,420
Probably would.
Are there.

2648
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,880
Can you list them off?
No,

2649
01:58:26,881 --> 01:58:27,714
but I can list off some of them.
I mean I could probably list them all 

2650
01:58:29,311 --> 01:58:30,320
but it would give me a couple of,
uh,

2651
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,340
so,
but think about all these ones that.

2652
01:58:32,410 --> 01:58:33,243
So these are all things that grab hold 
of your attention and sort of drive it 

2653
01:58:35,371 --> 01:58:35,700
into the now.

2654
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:38,460
So risk.
And it's not just physical risk,

2655
01:58:38,461 --> 01:58:40,740
right?
You emotional or a spiritual risk.

2656
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:43,330
Arrests.
Social risk is phenomenal.

2657
01:58:43,331 --> 01:58:44,164
Your social risks,
your brain can't tell the difference 

2658
01:58:46,151 --> 01:58:49,660
between social fear and physical fear.
So when people have unsafe sex,

2659
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:52,030
when they have sent some strangers that 
flow state thing,

2660
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:54,490
maybe flip some Weirdo at a bar and just
come on,

2661
01:58:54,491 --> 01:58:56,710
let's do it.
Take them back to your house,

2662
01:58:56,711 --> 01:58:58,060
you anything.
Now they know where you live.

2663
01:58:58,061 --> 01:58:59,140
Oh,
I don't even know you.

2664
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:00,970
I like how your role.
Yeah.

2665
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:02,530
No.
Uh,

2666
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,330
that's not,
that's not a flow state.

2667
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,660
It may be,
it may be.

2668
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:09,583
Um,
no,

2669
01:59:09,600 --> 01:59:12,070
I was just talking about this with 
somebody a couple days ago.

2670
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:12,933
We haven't,
I mean obviously there's all kinds of 

2671
01:59:14,351 --> 01:59:17,350
sexual flow triggers because obviously 
sex grabs hold of your attention.

2672
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:18,970
We just haven't.
It hasn't been looked at,

2673
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,810
but novelty,
complexity,

2674
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:24,970
unpredictability,
a deep embodiment,

2675
01:59:24,971 --> 01:59:27,700
which is when you're paying attention to
multiple sensory streams.

2676
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:28,950
One,
so not just like,

2677
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,063
you know,
a head on a stick looking at a computer 

2678
01:59:31,121 --> 01:59:31,910
screen,
but you're,

2679
01:59:31,910 --> 01:59:34,480
you know,
instead of learning through that way,

2680
01:59:34,481 --> 01:59:37,750
you're learning through doing so often.
Give you an example.

2681
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:38,763
Montessori education,
when they went looking for nonsports 

2682
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:44,590
examples of really high flow 
environments,

2683
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,440
a Montessori education is very high on 
the list.

2684
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:49,200
Um,
and uh,

2685
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,493
one of the reasons is Montessori 
education is often talked about is 

2686
01:59:53,110 --> 01:59:57,070
embodied education and they emphasize 
learning through doing.

2687
01:59:57,071 --> 01:59:57,904
So don't just read about the windmill.
Go out and build one when you're going 

2688
02:00:00,851 --> 02:00:01,684
out and building one,
you're engaging multiple sensory 

2689
02:00:02,861 --> 02:00:04,450
streams.
You're working with your hands,

2690
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:05,560
working with your eyes.
Obviously.

2691
02:00:06,010 --> 02:00:08,140
Drive attention into the now tends to 
drive flow.

2692
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:09,483
Yeah.
A lot of like super successful and 

2693
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:12,370
creative people came from Montessori 
education.

2694
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,233
Yeah.
There was a Wall Street Journal article 

2695
02:00:14,591 --> 02:00:15,424
about the Montessori Mafia,
but all the ceos in Silicon Valley were 

2696
02:00:18,611 --> 02:00:19,600
Montessori educated.

2697
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,233
Wow.
That's.

2698
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:25,150
My friend went.
He took his son to Montessori,

2699
02:00:25,151 --> 02:00:25,984
but who's like,
why is my kid like who's six in school 

2700
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:31,990
with a bunch of 14 year olds?
They're all in the same class.

2701
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:33,303
He's like the,
they have different age kids all hang 

2702
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:36,720
out together.
Yeah,

2703
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:38,470
because it's self directed learning.
Yeah.

2704
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,280
He didn't like that.
Makes Sense.

2705
02:00:42,940 --> 02:00:43,773
I mean,
it makes sense that,

2706
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:44,883
look,
I would imagine that having all these 

2707
02:00:47,261 --> 02:00:48,820
different things,
examples of,

2708
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:49,683
you know,
oh,

2709
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:52,000
that's what a 16 year old girls like,
you know,

2710
02:00:52,001 --> 02:00:55,360
when you're six,
that's what a 12 year old boys like,

2711
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:56,590
you know,
the greatest.

2712
02:00:56,600 --> 02:00:57,250
I mean,
for me,

2713
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,390
I mean,
I don't know about six,

2714
02:00:58,391 --> 02:01:02,530
but I was a 10 on.
I was a magician.

2715
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:05,380
That was my first job.
I was pressed to digitor.

2716
02:01:05,381 --> 02:01:08,170
I did birthday parties and misses and 
yeah.

2717
02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:10,140
And uh,
um,

2718
02:01:10,570 --> 02:01:11,500
you got hired.

2719
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,450
Yeah,
I know.

2720
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:15,700
11.
Arthur Benjamin,

2721
02:01:15,701 --> 02:01:17,980
who lived a crazy.
If I have lived a crazy life.

2722
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:21,310
This guy was Arthur Benjamin who became 
a mathematics genius.

2723
02:01:21,311 --> 02:01:22,144
He's the guy.
He's got a Ted famous Ted talk where he 

2724
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:25,690
squares numbers faster than calculators 
and whatever.

2725
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,580
I knew him.
He was from Cleveland,

2726
02:01:27,581 --> 02:01:29,770
Ohio with me.
And he was a magician.

2727
02:01:29,771 --> 02:01:30,604
He hit the ground round restaurant.
He was doing birthday parties on 

2728
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:36,410
Saturday and Sunday.
He went to college and he,

2729
02:01:36,430 --> 02:01:37,960
I was one of the only other magicians he
knew.

2730
02:01:37,961 --> 02:01:41,030
So he gave me the job.
I was 11 or 12 at the time.

2731
02:01:41,390 --> 02:01:42,160
So I,
you know,

2732
02:01:42,160 --> 02:01:44,510
I was every weekend I was,
you know,

2733
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:46,820
and I was making a ton of cash for it,
like an 11,

2734
02:01:46,821 --> 02:01:47,654
12 year old.
I was making 40 bucks a day for doing 

2735
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:51,320
like three birthday parties on Saturday 
and three on Sunday.

2736
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:52,633
Tiny money for her kid.
I think I bought a car in cash when I 

2737
02:01:54,411 --> 02:01:58,280
was 16 with it,
which they bought a bunch of it,

2738
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:59,143
the most obnoxious thing of the world,
the 16 year old kid walking in with a 

2739
02:02:01,671 --> 02:02:02,504
big role.
But I don't know how we got in to the 

2740
02:02:05,601 --> 02:02:07,190
magic word restart.
I don't know.

2741
02:02:08,090 --> 02:02:12,710
Close date risks.
How do we get the Magicians Jamie?

2742
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:15,060
First job.
There's no,

2743
02:02:15,450 --> 02:02:18,560
we're still not getting back there.
I don't know.

2744
02:02:18,561 --> 02:02:19,394
Okay.
So interesting tidbit about Steven that 

2745
02:02:20,661 --> 02:02:23,570
not many people now now they do to,
we'll call it,

2746
02:02:23,571 --> 02:02:24,404
that we're discussing is all the various
flow triggers and we're talking about 

2747
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:28,940
unsafe sex.
Maybe that's what it is.

2748
02:02:28,941 --> 02:02:30,230
You're having unsafe sex,
sex.

2749
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:32,780
He wrote lots of lots of.
I'm going to leave that one alone.

2750
02:02:32,790 --> 02:02:33,623
Those other.
I'm not going there with you pulling 

2751
02:02:35,631 --> 02:02:40,631
rabbits out of your hat and found me 
out.

2752
02:02:44,360 --> 02:02:46,790
So when,
when you document all these years,

2753
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,360
various flow states,
you know,

2754
02:02:48,361 --> 02:02:50,010
whether they're social flow state,
you know,

2755
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:51,750
what,
whatever it is or triggers rather social

2756
02:02:51,751 --> 02:02:54,510
triggers,
environmental danger,

2757
02:02:54,511 --> 02:02:55,344
risk.
You were talking about a bunch of 

2758
02:02:57,151 --> 02:03:01,710
different stimuli that's happening 
simultaneously.

2759
02:03:01,711 --> 02:03:05,790
You were talking about not just one form
of information coming at you,

2760
02:03:05,791 --> 02:03:07,950
but several.
And that's when he started talking about

2761
02:03:08,190 --> 02:03:10,290
the being a magician,
wasn't it?

2762
02:03:10,860 --> 02:03:11,693
Am I?
Right.

2763
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:13,770
Thanks.
So I think so.

2764
02:03:13,950 --> 02:03:14,820
Yeah.
That was it.

2765
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:16,100
Uh,
yeah.

2766
02:03:16,100 --> 02:03:17,570
I'm not going to be able to rewind it 
back.

2767
02:03:17,630 --> 02:03:19,130
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter to magic.

2768
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:19,983
Sorry.
Not.

2769
02:03:20,210 --> 02:03:25,010
There's all these different factors and 
all these different forms of stimulation

2770
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:29,960
that can sort of trigger this optimal 
state,

2771
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:34,130
its optimal state of consciousness.
And you've sort of documented cities and

2772
02:03:34,131 --> 02:03:37,670
studied these.
And what is your take out of it?

2773
02:03:37,671 --> 02:03:38,640
Like what,
what,

2774
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:39,583
what is like when you step back and you 
look at the book you wrote and you look 

2775
02:03:43,701 --> 02:03:44,534
at all the research that you've done,
you look at all the talks you've given 

2776
02:03:46,371 --> 02:03:48,050
and all the conversations that you've 
had about it.

2777
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:49,213
What can you impart on people that would
allow them to sort of be able to absorb 

2778
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:58,040
some of this into their life?
Does that make sense?

2779
02:03:58,610 --> 02:03:59,443
Meaning what can average people do?
What can the average person do to sort 

2780
02:04:01,941 --> 02:04:04,910
of.
I feel like most things require a step.

2781
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:06,163
Most things require like a little 
dipping your toe into the water as it 

2782
02:04:09,201 --> 02:04:10,034
were to sort of get,
get stimulated or get excited about 

2783
02:04:13,671 --> 02:04:14,504
doing something like this.
What do you think like the average 

2784
02:04:16,011 --> 02:04:21,011
person should do just to try to feel 
what a flow state could be?

2785
02:04:22,490 --> 02:04:23,510
Is there any one thing?
Yeah,

2786
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:24,950
that's an interesting question.
It's kind of a.

2787
02:04:25,100 --> 02:04:26,390
it's a.
it's a great question.

2788
02:04:26,391 --> 02:04:28,160
I think there's lots of stuff.

2789
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:31,473
How do you.

2790
02:04:33,430 --> 02:04:36,130
I mean yoga is a pretty good one,
right?

2791
02:04:36,160 --> 02:04:37,000
Yeah.
A lot of,

2792
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:37,980
a lot of people can

2793
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,460
use yoga as a great kind of gateway into
flow.

2794
02:04:41,461 --> 02:04:44,040
It's really easy because it,
it combines,

2795
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:45,031
you know,
a lot of,

2796
02:04:45,031 --> 02:04:48,420
like we'll do really simple things when 
we start working with people.

2797
02:04:48,421 --> 02:04:51,450
Like if we're working in a corporate 
environment,

2798
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:52,440
for example,
people,

2799
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:53,333
you know,
Mckinsey did a 10 year study and they 

2800
02:04:54,301 --> 02:04:55,134
found that top executives in flow are 
five times more productive than out of 

2801
02:04:58,561 --> 02:05:00,030
flow.
So that's 500 percent more.

2802
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:02,690
How do they decide that you're in 
Florida?

2803
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:04,410
They were,
this was a survey.

2804
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:05,303
They surveyed thousands of top 
executives and just ask them how much 

2805
02:05:08,311 --> 02:05:10,200
more productive are you in flow?
Um,

2806
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:11,183
but you,
there are psychological questionnaires 

2807
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:15,050
is kind of a sampling bias there though,
because the people that are successful,

2808
02:05:15,051 --> 02:05:15,291
like,
yeah,

2809
02:05:15,291 --> 02:05:16,124
it was flowing,
bro.

2810
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:18,660
It might be you,
you might be right about that.

2811
02:05:18,661 --> 02:05:20,970
I haven't,
I haven't dug deep enough into that.

2812
02:05:21,180 --> 02:05:23,010
That's an interesting point.
Okay.

2813
02:05:23,011 --> 02:05:24,150
So this may be,
maybe,

2814
02:05:24,170 --> 02:05:25,230
maybe it's not that,
right?

2815
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:26,633
That said,
first thing we do when we start working 

2816
02:05:29,671 --> 02:05:33,740
with corporations is tell people that 
you don't turn off your cellphone.

2817
02:05:33,810 --> 02:05:35,080
Turn off,
he like flower quarters,

2818
02:05:35,081 --> 02:05:36,430
I don't know.
No concentration.

2819
02:05:36,431 --> 02:05:39,030
So shut everything off,
you know,

2820
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:40,770
have you.
If you can't,

2821
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:42,480
you know,
you can't.

2822
02:05:42,481 --> 02:05:45,450
It's hard to sort of tack flow onto your
life.

2823
02:05:45,451 --> 02:05:47,850
You sort of got to put it the center of 
what you do.

2824
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:50,940
And for most people that seems like the 
state is,

2825
02:05:50,941 --> 02:05:53,370
there's so much creativity,
there's so much motivation,

2826
02:05:53,371 --> 02:05:55,050
there's learning,
accelerates,

2827
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:57,350
all the,
all that stuff to the upside is,

2828
02:05:57,520 --> 02:05:58,353
is worth it,
that people will start to build their 

2829
02:05:59,311 --> 02:06:01,590
lives around the state.
Um,

2830
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:02,760
you know,
I.

2831
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:05,310
Yoga is a pretty easy way in.
I think it,

2832
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:08,310
I think a lot of people can kind of 
taste it that way.

2833
02:06:08,550 --> 02:06:09,540
Um,
you know,

2834
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:10,660
it's interesting.
So in,

2835
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:11,503
in stealing fire in my,
in my next book and the book that comes 

2836
02:06:13,111 --> 02:06:15,720
out.
And what is it about worry word stealing

2837
02:06:15,721 --> 02:06:19,860
fire is a,
bout a $4,000,000,000,000

2838
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:24,950
underground revolution in altered states
of consciousness that is,

2839
02:06:25,330 --> 02:06:26,163
you know,
involves kind of the top performance 

2840
02:06:27,811 --> 02:06:30,540
from pretty much every domain and no 
one's talking about it.

2841
02:06:30,990 --> 02:06:33,930
And yet if you know where to look,
it's everywhere you look.

2842
02:06:34,350 --> 02:06:35,183
So it's a book about a revolution and 
people utilizing altered states of 

2843
02:06:37,831 --> 02:06:38,664
consciousness.
I'm to massively drive performance and 

2844
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:45,600
across all different kinds of altered 
states.

2845
02:06:45,960 --> 02:06:48,330
Wow.
Did that piece of shit crash again?

2846
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:52,700
How dare you try castor?
Whoever the fuck is making the tricaster

2847
02:06:53,480 --> 02:06:56,690
you fucking mutts.
Your machine sucks.

2848
02:06:56,810 --> 02:06:59,330
What is it goes down every time.
It's the video switcher.

2849
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:02,030
So now we're still.
We're still recording,

2850
02:07:02,060 --> 02:07:02,893
but the audio version,
Jamie will have to splice the audio 

2851
02:07:04,911 --> 02:07:05,744
recording into the video recording now 
and we're going to have to a yell at 

2852
02:07:10,581 --> 02:07:11,414
these tricaster people.
This has been happening on a regular 

2853
02:07:13,011 --> 02:07:13,844
basis.
Now.

2854
02:07:15,230 --> 02:07:16,063
Only the best thing you can buy.
It's only the best fucking piece of 

2855
02:07:18,111 --> 02:07:21,230
equipment you could buy anyway.
This,

2856
02:07:21,590 --> 02:07:22,470
this,
um,

2857
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:25,070
altered states of consciousness 
research,

2858
02:07:25,071 --> 02:07:27,440
like what are they concentrating on?
All the different,

2859
02:07:27,441 --> 02:07:29,720
various altered states of consciousness.
So what

2860
02:07:30,750 --> 02:07:35,750
one of the interesting things is,
and we talk about this in stealing fire,

2861
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,720
is a lot of.
We use the term Iq status.

2862
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:44,470
It's a,
it's a Greek term and it's what ecstatic

2863
02:07:44,471 --> 02:07:45,960
comes from ecstasy from,
from.

2864
02:07:46,030 --> 02:07:48,940
But it originally means if you go back 
to Plato,

2865
02:07:48,941 --> 02:07:52,810
it means estate beyond your normal sense
of self,

2866
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:56,440
where you tend to be filled with 
information and inspiration or intuition

2867
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:59,320
like.
So that was the classic Greek definition

2868
02:07:59,321 --> 02:08:00,154
of extensive if you.
So we are interested in those altered 

2869
02:08:03,611 --> 02:08:04,444
states that tend to produce this,
this particular experience and that's 

2870
02:08:06,941 --> 02:08:10,840
everything from contemplated and 
mystical states flow states of,

2871
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:15,350
of all kinds of psychedelic states fall 
into this category as well in the.

2872
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:16,233
I mean the interesting thing is we've 
been talking a lot about the 

2873
02:08:18,101 --> 02:08:19,360
neurobiology of flow,
right?

2874
02:08:19,361 --> 02:08:21,820
What goes on under the hood.
But the interesting thing,

2875
02:08:21,821 --> 02:08:24,070
and this is what sort of like,
if you go back 100 years,

2876
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,233
William James,
who kind of early Harvard psychologists 

2877
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:29,360
you know,
bought,

2878
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:30,370
you know,
flow states,

2879
02:08:30,371 --> 02:08:32,860
mystical experiences,
contemplate of experiences,

2880
02:08:32,890 --> 02:08:34,100
psychedelic experiences.

2881
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:35,770
He thought they were all the same thing,
right?

2882
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:39,070
They weren't split apart over the course
of the past hundred years.

2883
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:40,413
We split those things apart.
But what's happening now is we can look 

2884
02:08:44,081 --> 02:08:48,340
under the hood and when you look under 
the hood and you look at flow versus say

2885
02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:51,910
a near death experiences versus a 
psychedelic state,

2886
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:54,190
very,
very similar things are happening in the

2887
02:08:54,191 --> 02:08:57,610
brain in all these states,
prefrontal Cortex,

2888
02:08:57,820 --> 02:09:00,370
parts of the brain,
or deactivating and get the same five or

2889
02:09:00,371 --> 02:09:01,204
six neurochemicals.
You have brainwave moving towards Alpha 

2890
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:04,570
Theta.
They're all very similar.

2891
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:07,870
They may get you there in different ways
like psychedelics,

2892
02:09:07,871 --> 02:09:10,110
for example,
a inflow.

2893
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:12,130
It's an efficiency exchange,
right?

2894
02:09:12,131 --> 02:09:17,080
So what happens is we trade and our 
brain has a fixed energy budget.

2895
02:09:17,081 --> 02:09:18,430
It's an energy hog,
right?

2896
02:09:18,431 --> 02:09:22,270
Uses about 25 percent of your energy,
yet two percent of your mass,

2897
02:09:22,271 --> 02:09:23,620
20,
25 percent of your energy.

2898
02:09:23,830 --> 02:09:24,663
It's got a fixed energy budget.
So what happens in flow is we allocate 

2899
02:09:28,331 --> 02:09:30,910
more and more energy for focus and 
attention,

2900
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:34,690
and then the brain starts shutting down 
noncritical structures,

2901
02:09:34,870 --> 02:09:35,860
right?
That's what happens.

2902
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:37,690
That's why your sense of self 
disappears.

2903
02:09:37,870 --> 02:09:40,630
That's why time passes strangely.
It's that efficiency exchange.

2904
02:09:40,930 --> 02:09:44,500
Psychedelics also downregulate the 
prefrontal cortex.

2905
02:09:44,650 --> 02:09:46,360
They do it by overwhelming,
right?

2906
02:09:46,361 --> 02:09:50,920
They let in so much stimuli that you can
no longer process it with your conscious

2907
02:09:50,921 --> 02:09:51,754
mind.
It sort of kicks things over to the 

2908
02:09:52,301 --> 02:09:55,390
subconscious,
but the end result is the same.

2909
02:09:55,391 --> 02:09:58,060
You get this sense of selflessness and 
timelessness,

2910
02:09:58,180 --> 02:10:01,900
effortlessness and information richness 
that shows up in all these states.

2911
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:04,480
All these states,
they have different names,

2912
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:07,570
but you look under the hood and the 
neurobiology is the same.

2913
02:10:07,571 --> 02:10:10,960
And the experience like how we feel in 
the estates,

2914
02:10:11,230 --> 02:10:12,063
well,
we feel like our sense of self has 

2915
02:10:13,091 --> 02:10:13,480
disappeared.

2916
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:16,600
We feel like time is passing strangely.
There all effortless effort.

2917
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:18,100
Like when you're in flow,
every decision,

2918
02:10:18,101 --> 02:10:20,410
every action follows seamlessly,
fluidly,

2919
02:10:20,411 --> 02:10:23,170
perfectly from the next.
That's sort of the definition of flow.

2920
02:10:23,470 --> 02:10:26,560
And they're all information rich states.
So we tend to think.

2921
02:10:26,561 --> 02:10:28,690
I tend to think about these things I'm 
saying we,

2922
02:10:28,691 --> 02:10:30,910
because I co wrote this book with my 
partner Jamie Wheal,

2923
02:10:30,911 --> 02:10:32,490
who I started the flow genome project 
with.

2924
02:10:32,740 --> 02:10:33,573
Um,
I tend to think of all these states is 

2925
02:10:34,681 --> 02:10:35,514
sort of like big data for the mind to 
access to a much more information 

2926
02:10:38,451 --> 02:10:39,284
inspiration,
but they seem to be all the same 

2927
02:10:40,731 --> 02:10:41,564
experience under the hood.
So what this means is why is this giant 

2928
02:10:45,081 --> 02:10:45,914
revolution will cause.
There's all these different subcultures 

2929
02:10:48,050 --> 02:10:49,580
that are doing different things and it's
not,

2930
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:50,593
you know,
you can get the same effects 

2931
02:10:51,081 --> 02:10:53,600
technologically transcranial 
stimulation.

2932
02:10:53,601 --> 02:10:54,180
You can,
you,

2933
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:57,920
you can use weak magnetic pulses to 
knock out the prefrontal cortex.

2934
02:10:58,280 --> 02:10:59,640
And they're now doing that.
I don't like,

2935
02:10:59,650 --> 02:11:01,320
I don't know if you're following this,
but um,

2936
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,181
you know,
in,

2937
02:11:02,181 --> 02:11:04,030
in stealing fire we did a lot of work 
with,

2938
02:11:04,280 --> 02:11:05,113
with the Navy seals and you know,
if you dig under the hood with seal 

2939
02:11:08,661 --> 02:11:09,890
training,
they'll tell you that,

2940
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:11,023
you know,
obviously there's levels of physical 

2941
02:11:12,471 --> 02:11:15,320
skills and you know,
tactical sales that you have to have.

2942
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:16,393
But most everything else that we think 
of as seal training is a giant group 

2943
02:11:19,341 --> 02:11:21,830
flow filtration system.
So they can get,

2944
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:22,753
you know,
the screening for people who can drop 

2945
02:11:24,291 --> 02:11:27,440
into glue group flow together at the 
click of a hat.

2946
02:11:27,441 --> 02:11:29,930
Because it's how you work best work at a
team,

2947
02:11:31,990 --> 02:11:32,823
you see the same kind of things across 
the boards and all of these high 

2948
02:11:35,451 --> 02:11:36,284
performing groups,
but the seals don't think of themselves 

2949
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:40,340
in the same way that the yoga moms think
of themselves.

2950
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:42,890
They would never say we're doing the 
same thing,

2951
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:43,993
or you know,
the hippies and Ravers who were taken 

2952
02:11:46,241 --> 02:11:47,074
acts or drive.
You would never think that these people 

2953
02:11:49,101 --> 02:11:49,934
are involved in the same revolution they
were in this world than say moon is 

2954
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:53,713
absolutely the same thing.
They're seeking the same ability to 

2955
02:11:56,241 --> 02:11:57,074
change the channel.
And the reason is there are certain 

2956
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:03,800
quote unquote skills.
Twenty first century skills,

2957
02:12:03,801 --> 02:12:05,530
whether it's healing,
massive trauma,

2958
02:12:05,560 --> 02:12:06,910
anxiety,
um,

2959
02:12:07,310 --> 02:12:08,143
or creativity,
cooperation in these kinds of things 

2960
02:12:10,490 --> 02:12:11,323
were the way we've been built from an 
evolutionary standpoint to optimize 

2961
02:12:14,511 --> 02:12:15,344
those things is through altered states,
is through changing the channel and 

2962
02:12:17,841 --> 02:12:20,300
utilizing non ordinary states of 
consciousness.

2963
02:12:20,301 --> 02:12:24,030
So the book is about getting the giant 
revolution that's going on with this and

2964
02:12:24,070 --> 02:12:24,903
kind of four emerging forces that are 
driving this forward and making it go 

2965
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:29,714
faster and wider.
Have you concentrated on holotropic 

2966
02:12:32,271 --> 02:12:34,520
breathing or meditation practices?

2967
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:37,100
Are Kundalini or any of those things?
We focus on.

2968
02:12:37,120 --> 02:12:37,953
We looked at,
we looked at all that stuff and 

2969
02:12:39,081 --> 02:12:40,670
obviously,
you know,

2970
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:41,743
respiration breathing stuff is easiest 
possible way in the world that change 

2971
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:47,360
your consciousness.
Right?

2972
02:12:47,750 --> 02:12:49,550
And I mean in everybody,
you know,

2973
02:12:49,610 --> 02:12:53,690
whether it's on the vm off side with his
kind of crazy version of,

2974
02:12:53,720 --> 02:12:54,770
of breath,
of fire,

2975
02:12:54,771 --> 02:12:57,200
which has a long history in yoga,
you know,

2976
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:58,183
everybody sort or whether it's,
you know what Laird Hamilton and Brian 

2977
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:02,200
Mackenzie are doing,
you know,

2978
02:13:02,260 --> 02:13:04,040
what are they doing on the pool 
training?

2979
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:06,740
They're just a different version they're
using.

2980
02:13:06,741 --> 02:13:07,574
It's different versions of apnea 
training where they're using various 

2981
02:13:10,281 --> 02:13:14,830
breath holds and things along those 
lines to alter consciousness in abet.

2982
02:13:14,870 --> 02:13:18,050
Performance seems to be kind of going on
across the boards everywhere.

2983
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:19,670
Well,
the respiration stuff,

2984
02:13:19,730 --> 02:13:20,563
Hixon Gracie,
who's probably the greatest Jujitsu 

2985
02:13:23,481 --> 02:13:26,150
practitioner of all time,
at least he certainly wasn't his era,

2986
02:13:26,210 --> 02:13:28,550
recognized by everyone as being the 
best,

2987
02:13:28,551 --> 02:13:32,040
was a massive yoga practitioner who is a
Yogi and one

2988
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,873
of the things that he was really deeply,
deeply invested in his breath work and 

2989
02:13:36,571 --> 02:13:37,404
he would do that crazy shit where he 
sucks his stomach up deep into his rib 

2990
02:13:40,441 --> 02:13:41,610
cage.
Have you ever seen,

2991
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:43,860
I know extent do that.
When he does it,

2992
02:13:43,861 --> 02:13:44,694
it's super bizarre because he's got 
amazing control so his stomach is like 

2993
02:13:47,491 --> 02:13:51,210
going in and also the people say it's 
the secret.

2994
02:13:51,211 --> 02:13:54,600
If you want the lower kind of add band,
you have to learn to suck it in.

2995
02:13:54,601 --> 02:13:55,434
I don't know.
I never really played with lots of 

2996
02:13:56,700 --> 02:13:57,533
static.
I mean it is aesthetic thing he's not 

2997
02:14:00,841 --> 02:14:03,960
doing.
I mean he's trying to do is achieve this

2998
02:14:03,961 --> 02:14:04,794
complete control of the breath for sure.
And in Jujitsu that's really important 

2999
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:11,800
because there's many times where you're 
locked up on something and you're,

3000
02:14:11,801 --> 02:14:14,400
you're panicking and when you're 
panicking,

3001
02:14:14,401 --> 02:14:15,234
you're heartbeats too fast.
You need more oxygen and you can't 

3002
02:14:17,821 --> 02:14:18,654
breathe and you freak out,
and the ability to stay calm and 

3003
02:14:20,881 --> 02:14:23,760
controlled is directly related to your 
ability to control your breathing.

3004
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:27,240
One of the first things you know we 
train people to do is,

3005
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:30,570
so if you,
if your exhale is about seven seconds or

3006
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:31,800
longer,
you probably know this.

3007
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:35,340
You can't have a fight or flight 
response because your brain goes,

3008
02:14:35,610 --> 02:14:36,750
oh,
look at this long,

3009
02:14:36,751 --> 02:14:41,160
luxurious exhale.
You must be calm so you won't panic.

3010
02:14:41,490 --> 02:14:42,480
So one of the,
you know,

3011
02:14:42,481 --> 02:14:45,710
with when working with action sport 
athletes or people you know,

3012
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:47,040
I guess you could do with fighters as 
well,

3013
02:14:47,041 --> 02:14:47,874
we've done it with some of the,
some of the special forces guys just 

3014
02:14:50,491 --> 02:14:51,324
really slowing down the breathing,
the exhale a little bit in most 

3015
02:14:54,601 --> 02:14:56,970
situations,
probably couldn't do it mid fight,

3016
02:14:57,420 --> 02:14:59,640
probably certain sports situation can't 
do it,

3017
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:00,683
but you can always usually get like a 
three second inhale and a seven second 

3018
02:15:03,901 --> 02:15:07,330
exhale and you know,
you do about three of those and you will

3019
02:15:07,770 --> 02:15:10,740
really calm down your central nervous 
system really quickly.

3020
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:12,293
That's really interesting.
There's a thing that happens in a 

3021
02:15:14,180 --> 02:15:17,990
bowhunting they called target panic and 
it's the dealing,

3022
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:21,450
the difference between a closed loop 
system and an open loop system,

3023
02:15:21,810 --> 02:15:22,643
meaning when you are in the middle of 
doing something and you're when you're 

3024
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:29,093
drawing back on an animal,
you panic and you just slam the trigger 

3025
02:15:31,651 --> 02:15:33,590
and you freak out and your emotions and 
your,

3026
02:15:33,591 --> 02:15:36,210
your,
your anxiety gets carried away with you,

3027
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:37,313
but if you follow a certain protocol and
pay attention to all your movements and 

3028
02:15:41,641 --> 02:15:46,090
have everything in a row,
then your concentration on your movement

3029
02:15:46,091 --> 02:15:46,924
sort of overtakes your anxiety and all 
the issues that you would have and it 

3030
02:15:50,611 --> 02:15:51,444
allows you to carry through with this 
very difficult thing in this very 

3031
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:58,170
intense and sort of like pressure field 
filled situation.

3032
02:15:58,420 --> 02:15:59,850
That makes sense.
Did it go down again?

3033
02:16:00,550 --> 02:16:03,610
It's completely acting way up.
I can't even look.

3034
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:06,540
Click on anything right now.
I've tried to reset it five times so.

3035
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:08,183
Well.
Well we'll splice in the audio to the 

3036
02:16:09,331 --> 02:16:11,940
video.
This fucking piece of shit.

3037
02:16:12,410 --> 02:16:14,900
Um,
when you guys went,

3038
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:17,160
you know,
concentrating on these different altered

3039
02:16:17,161 --> 02:16:20,880
states of consciousness,
do you have like a hierarchy of them?

3040
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:21,541
Do you just,
uh,

3041
02:16:21,541 --> 02:16:22,374
examine all of them?
Are some of them more beneficial than 

3042
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:25,460
others?
So let me get it.

3043
02:16:25,461 --> 02:16:26,330
Let's get it.
Let's talk about,

3044
02:16:26,331 --> 02:16:28,650
let's,
let's look at trauma for example.

3045
02:16:28,680 --> 02:16:29,513
Okay.
So what

3046
02:16:30,730 --> 02:16:33,220
they all seem to do the same thing.
It's timescale.

3047
02:16:33,221 --> 02:16:34,054
So we know Michael Mithoefer hoffer's 
work used mgma for to treat ptsd in 

3048
02:16:39,221 --> 02:16:40,054
victims of child abuse and sexual abuse 
and trauma from the wars in Iraq and 

3049
02:16:45,881 --> 02:16:46,541
Afghanistan.
Right?

3050
02:16:46,541 --> 02:16:47,374
This is the work that went down in South
Carolina that lead right there was the 

3051
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:52,930
foundational work.
And what they discovered,

3052
02:16:52,931 --> 02:16:53,764
what he's discovered is one to three 
sessions with Mtma therapy is enough to 

3053
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:05,980
significantly reduce or completely 
remove ptsd symptoms.

3054
02:17:05,981 --> 02:17:08,080
Right?
And they've done a lot of this.

3055
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:09,333
So they redid that at Camp Pendleton 
with about a thousand soldiers and 

3056
02:17:13,751 --> 02:17:16,960
instead of Mtma,
they replaced it with flow.

3057
02:17:16,961 --> 02:17:20,650
They used surfing as a flow trigger and 
talk therapy.

3058
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:22,930
And they've done this with about a 
thousand soldiers this,

3059
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:24,190
this point.
So.

3060
02:17:24,191 --> 02:17:25,840
And they're getting the same end 
results,

3061
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:29,290
but it takes about five weeks of surfing
and talk therapy.

3062
02:17:29,291 --> 02:17:34,270
So the MTMA get to these results in 
about one to three sessions,

3063
02:17:34,271 --> 02:17:37,780
so three days tops,
five weeks with the surfing,

3064
02:17:38,620 --> 02:17:40,150
with the surfing and talk therapy.

3065
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:40,983
And then they redid it again,
different different scientists with 

3066
02:17:43,121 --> 02:17:48,121
meditation and it takes about 12 weeks 
with meditation and they can't get it.

3067
02:17:48,700 --> 02:17:49,533
I don't think they've gotten a total 
reduction of ptsd symptoms with 

3068
02:17:52,480 --> 02:17:55,990
meditation,
but for sure people's with meds drop.

3069
02:17:56,170 --> 02:18:00,010
So it's the same sort of result,
different timescales.

3070
02:18:00,220 --> 02:18:01,053
Right.
So it's the interventions are doing the 

3071
02:18:02,681 --> 02:18:05,360
same thing inside the brain,
right?

3072
02:18:05,390 --> 02:18:09,250
The same thing as sort of happening.
It's a question and it's really how much

3073
02:18:09,251 --> 02:18:10,084
risk you want to take Mtma.
Well you got to put an amphetamine into 

3074
02:18:12,251 --> 02:18:15,190
your system surfing.
There's a little bit of risk out there.

3075
02:18:15,191 --> 02:18:17,830
And the waves,
not particularly dangerous meditation.

3076
02:18:17,831 --> 02:18:19,810
There's almost no risk.
So where,

3077
02:18:19,870 --> 02:18:22,750
where are your risk tolerances?
How much time do you have?

3078
02:18:22,990 --> 02:18:26,470
Those are the kinds of questions you can
ask around this.

3079
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:30,520
It sounds like the MTMA also would be 
way easier for it to be effective,

3080
02:18:30,521 --> 02:18:32,770
whereas with surfing or something like 
that,

3081
02:18:32,771 --> 02:18:35,470
you'd have to really stick to some sort 
of a protocol here.

3082
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:37,150
Have stick.
They're constantly doing it.

3083
02:18:37,151 --> 02:18:40,570
Really getting involved in staying 
engaged in it where if you do ecstasy,

3084
02:18:40,571 --> 02:18:41,404
you kind of have to be engaged.
So just takes what hunter said right by 

3085
02:18:43,841 --> 02:18:44,860
the ticket.
Take the ride.

3086
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:46,420
Yeah,
it just takes you.

3087
02:18:46,520 --> 02:18:47,380
Look,
here we go.

3088
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:48,220
Come on.
Come on.

3089
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:50,260
Let me write that.
When I talk about effortlessness,

3090
02:18:50,261 --> 02:18:51,220
right?
With flow,

3091
02:18:51,221 --> 02:18:53,590
it's every action,
every decision leads seamlessly,

3092
02:18:53,591 --> 02:18:54,311
perfectly.
The next one,

3093
02:18:54,311 --> 02:18:57,160
you talking about the effortlessness of 
a psychedelic experience,

3094
02:18:57,460 --> 02:18:59,860
you know,
drop the pill,

3095
02:18:59,861 --> 02:19:00,694
take the hit,
and you are effortlessly in another 

3096
02:19:03,191 --> 02:19:04,390
altar.
You know what I mean?

3097
02:19:04,391 --> 02:19:05,440
You're there.
Well,

3098
02:19:05,441 --> 02:19:06,274
I'm.
I'm really excited about the fact that 

3099
02:19:07,391 --> 02:19:08,224
marijuana has been legalized in 
California and now I hopefully I hope 

3100
02:19:12,550 --> 02:19:13,383
we're going to start to see some headway
being moved into other psychedelic 

3101
02:19:16,631 --> 02:19:18,580
drugs,
whether it's mushrooms or Lsd.

3102
02:19:19,030 --> 02:19:22,870
I think there's a lot of drugs that 
could be incredibly beneficial to people

3103
02:19:23,110 --> 02:19:25,380
that aren't being utilized where it's 
Ibogaine.

3104
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:26,980
I believe we were talking about that 
before the.

3105
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:28,010
We were talking

3106
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:33,010
about animals that target various,
various ways of altering their states of

3107
02:19:33,081 --> 02:19:34,160
consciousness.
You know,

3108
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:38,600
I know dolphins find puffer fish and get
high upper fish puff,

3109
02:19:38,601 --> 02:19:43,280
puff pass our goats,
gobble,

3110
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:47,950
gobble,
locoweed loco,

3111
02:19:47,951 --> 02:19:49,840
loco loco.
We'd is cows.

3112
02:19:50,120 --> 02:19:52,570
Cats are catnip.
Baboons,

3113
02:19:52,580 --> 02:19:54,850
as we talked about where I boga,
um,

3114
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,330
the reindeer obviously are going after 
the mushrooms,

3115
02:19:58,350 --> 02:20:00,800
many to ms Dot Kara.
Dogs are gone for silicide.

3116
02:20:00,810 --> 02:20:02,780
Been is what they found.
But there are probably other things.

3117
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:03,673
Elephants pretty much at any animals 
found a way to alter their 

3118
02:20:05,811 --> 02:20:06,644
consciousness.
Elephants will drink fermented bog 

3119
02:20:07,761 --> 02:20:11,150
water.
There's otters if they can't,

3120
02:20:11,151 --> 02:20:13,010
and I can't remember what their drug of 
choice is,

3121
02:20:13,190 --> 02:20:15,590
but if they can't find it,
they will actually hit themselves in the

3122
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:17,960
head with a rock to alter their 
consciousness.

3123
02:20:18,220 --> 02:20:20,100
Right?
Oh my God,

3124
02:20:20,101 --> 02:20:21,180
I've done that personally on,
uh,

3125
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:22,790
on occasion a couple of times.

3126
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:24,200
You know,
you know what,

3127
02:20:24,201 --> 02:20:26,720
I'm going to be hard outs,
but I watched a hotter kill a monkey the

3128
02:20:26,721 --> 02:20:29,540
other day online.
Otter drowned a monkey.

3129
02:20:29,650 --> 02:20:30,483
It was fucking crazy.
Like in the other markets to trying to 

3130
02:20:32,241 --> 02:20:33,440
rescue them,
the monkey.

3131
02:20:33,441 --> 02:20:34,460
And he's like,
fuck you.

3132
02:20:34,461 --> 02:20:37,880
And the audit took the monkey and was 
holding on him when drowning them.

3133
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,290
Wow.
Yeah.

3134
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:41,600
Otters are murderers.
I had no idea.

3135
02:20:41,601 --> 02:20:42,780
I had no idea.
Yeah.

3136
02:20:42,870 --> 02:20:44,210
Um,
I had no idea the,

3137
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:46,040
yeah,
they're uh,

3138
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:46,953
they're crazy little animals.
But you were listing before the podcast 

3139
02:20:49,551 --> 02:20:50,384
started all the various animals that 
have found some way to alter their 

3140
02:20:53,901 --> 02:20:56,000
consciousness and it's almost all of 
them.

3141
02:20:56,150 --> 02:20:57,740
Yeah.
So this is not.

3142
02:20:57,800 --> 02:20:59,750
This is the guy who did this original 
work.

3143
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:02,330
Let's give credit where credit is due.
It's Ronald K Siegel.

3144
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:03,433
He's at Ucla.
And if you really want to read the 

3145
02:21:04,700 --> 02:21:07,100
cortext on this,
it's a book called intoxication.

3146
02:21:07,550 --> 02:21:08,383
And it covers kind of everything.
But at this point they believe that 

3147
02:21:11,841 --> 02:21:13,460
pretty much every,
you know,

3148
02:21:13,461 --> 02:21:15,590
at least mammalian species and earth,
the birds do it.

3149
02:21:15,591 --> 02:21:18,650
Two birds will go crazy for marijuana 
seeds if they can get them,

3150
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:22,980
has found a way to alter their 
consciousness and there's very few,

3151
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,610
we were talking about this earlier,
but there's very good reasons for it and

3152
02:21:25,611 --> 02:21:29,720
it's animals,
like humans get stuck in ruts and they,

3153
02:21:29,950 --> 02:21:30,580
you know,
you,

3154
02:21:30,580 --> 02:21:31,413
you keep doing the same pattern over and
over and you're getting no results and 

3155
02:21:33,681 --> 02:21:35,660
you have to be to kind of shift your 
state,

3156
02:21:35,661 --> 02:21:40,100
changed the channel.
And so using the Edward Edward de Bono,

3157
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:40,963
uh,
talks about psychedelics in these kinds 

3158
02:21:42,351 --> 02:21:44,810
of substances,
d patterning instruments,

3159
02:21:44,990 --> 02:21:49,010
they allow us to break out of our 
patterns and they allow us to innovate.

3160
02:21:49,011 --> 02:21:50,270
Basically they put us in,
you know,

3161
02:21:50,271 --> 02:21:53,630
innovative Switzerland,
which for survival is critical.

3162
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:54,463
So every species seems to have found one
way or the other to alter their 

3163
02:21:58,281 --> 02:22:02,030
consciousness to upc kind of cognitive 
performance and creativity.

3164
02:22:02,510 --> 02:22:03,343
Problem solve.
This is fascinating that these animals 

3165
02:22:05,091 --> 02:22:05,924
would want that.
You would think that what they would 

3166
02:22:07,131 --> 02:22:08,760
want is to be constantly,
hey,

3167
02:22:08,761 --> 02:22:09,650
look at that.
We're on TV,

3168
02:22:10,380 --> 02:22:12,020
we're back up.
No,

3169
02:22:12,290 --> 02:22:13,123
you would think that these animals would
want to be constantly aware of their 

3170
02:22:15,531 --> 02:22:17,610
surroundings and constantly alert.
Yes.

3171
02:22:17,620 --> 02:22:18,590
So that was the question,
right?

3172
02:22:18,591 --> 02:22:19,424
That was the big question that they 
started to ask is like with the fuck 

3173
02:22:22,101 --> 02:22:23,720
with this come from like how if,
if,

3174
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:26,180
if it's red in tooth and claw

3175
02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:28,380
out there,
why would you possibly,

3176
02:22:28,610 --> 02:22:29,443
you know,
want to take a psychedelic like Iboga 

3177
02:22:31,441 --> 02:22:32,274
where you're talking about the Jaguars 
taking Iowasca where the effects are 

3178
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:38,190
significant and long lasting.
So,

3179
02:22:38,191 --> 02:22:39,420
and the,
the,

3180
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:40,283
the answer seems to be that the creative
problem solving boost you get from 

3181
02:22:45,301 --> 02:22:46,134
psychedelics is worth.
It could just be that the highfields so 

3182
02:22:48,811 --> 02:22:51,000
good that everybody wants it.
But yeah.

3183
02:22:51,001 --> 02:22:55,320
Well it also could be like some sort of 
a stress alleviation mechanism for a lot

3184
02:22:55,321 --> 02:22:56,154
of these animals that are dealing with 
the Tooth Fang and clogs assistance of 

3185
02:22:58,601 --> 02:23:01,290
being a wild animal.
It just distress if at all.

3186
02:23:01,291 --> 02:23:03,060
Like sometimes I just need a little 
break,

3187
02:23:03,930 --> 02:23:04,763
so drink some fermented fruit,
fermented Bhagwat water whacked out and 

3188
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:09,023
chill out.
For Awhile we were talking about the 

3189
02:23:09,841 --> 02:23:14,340
Jaguars that take a dmt rich plants is.
So here's the thing I don't understand,

3190
02:23:14,341 --> 02:23:16,920
isn't Ios is a blend of two different 
plants.

3191
02:23:16,920 --> 02:23:19,920
Right.
So how did the Jaguars get both?

3192
02:23:20,020 --> 02:23:21,000
That's a good question.
Well,

3193
02:23:21,001 --> 02:23:21,834
the question would be whether or not 
Jaguars have monoamine oxidase and your 

3194
02:23:24,570 --> 02:23:25,403
stomach.
Okay.

3195
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:26,273
Yeah,
that's the exact question that they 

3196
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:28,410
don't.
That would make sense.

3197
02:23:28,411 --> 02:23:30,540
Yeah.
So what if they don't?

3198
02:23:30,570 --> 02:23:32,830
That means that it's active to them.
Right.

3199
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:33,721
So we,
you know,

3200
02:23:33,721 --> 02:23:37,230
we eat plants and we meet,
we're omnivores.

3201
02:23:37,231 --> 02:23:40,410
They are obligate predators so they 
don't need any plants.

3202
02:23:40,650 --> 02:23:43,200
So when they do eat plants,
they're just eating them for a goof.

3203
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:44,453
So if they do eat them,
they probably don't have the 

3204
02:23:46,260 --> 02:23:50,670
compensatory mechanisms in their system 
to process the DMT rich plants.

3205
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:51,760
And we do,
you know,

3206
02:23:51,761 --> 02:23:56,130
that's what model amy knock stays does.
That's why Mao inhibitors or you know,

3207
02:23:56,190 --> 02:23:58,560
they use harming,
they mix it up with the.

3208
02:23:59,250 --> 02:24:04,250
But people that have taken actual,
like pharmaceutical grade Mao inhibitors

3209
02:24:04,591 --> 02:24:06,270
to have horrible experiences.

3210
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:08,630
Like if you,
if you try to use an,

3211
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:09,623
a real Mao inhibitor,
like from a pharmaceutical company and 

3212
02:24:12,211 --> 02:24:16,860
then throw some dmt in there as well.
Apparently it's a real bad time.

3213
02:24:17,060 --> 02:24:17,920
Oh Wow.
Yeah,

3214
02:24:17,921 --> 02:24:21,990
and it's super dangerous and you know,
you could break your fucking brain.

3215
02:24:22,410 --> 02:24:26,070
There's some would story,
some horror stories.

3216
02:24:26,071 --> 02:24:26,904
It might be or what it might be some 
other website where the people were 

3217
02:24:28,330 --> 02:24:30,780
documenting trips.
Hyperspace lexicon.

3218
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:32,340
Yeah.
And they were just saying,

3219
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:35,670
hey,
don't do this important safety tip.

3220
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:39,900
I've also heard horrible experiences of 
people mixing mushrooms and DMT.

3221
02:24:40,410 --> 02:24:43,710
I've heard really bad experiences with 
that as well.

3222
02:24:44,030 --> 02:24:44,863
That's interesting.
And it seems like it has a habit not to 

3223
02:24:48,421 --> 02:24:49,254
get metaphysical about DMT,
but it has a habit of smacking down 

3224
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:54,113
certain users.
A lot of people tell those stories that 

3225
02:24:56,510 --> 02:24:59,880
something about the substance doesn't 
allow itself to be abused.

3226
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,300
You find that a lot in our wood and the 
hyperspace lexicon,

3227
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:04,950
places like that.
That sort of gets to a point and then it

3228
02:25:04,951 --> 02:25:07,710
warns you and cutting out the other.
Interesting.

3229
02:25:07,711 --> 02:25:09,690
I don't have any idea what the hell that
means,

3230
02:25:09,691 --> 02:25:11,550
and I just said it,
but like it's interesting.

3231
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:12,523
That's the exact description of a 
tattooist that I know who had done it 

3232
02:25:15,031 --> 02:25:20,031
like 100 days in a row and then finally 
he said like literally when he tripped,

3233
02:25:20,221 --> 02:25:21,830
he went into this dimension and they 
were,

3234
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:23,680
they were kicking them.
They were like,

3235
02:25:23,690 --> 02:25:25,210
listen,
you fuck you gotta.

3236
02:25:25,211 --> 02:25:26,710
Stop doing this.
They were very adamant,

3237
02:25:27,790 --> 02:25:31,550
damaged,
exact story happened to a friend of mine

3238
02:25:31,610 --> 02:25:33,200
who was just.
He was told he was,

3239
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:33,740
you know,
whatever.

3240
02:25:33,740 --> 02:25:36,920
He's tripping balls and they were like,
you're not to do this again.

3241
02:25:37,460 --> 02:25:38,420
Wow,
okay.

3242
02:25:38,820 --> 02:25:41,000
That completely makes sense.
I mean,

3243
02:25:41,001 --> 02:25:41,834
if it seems to me like something that 
you can only really handle in small 

3244
02:25:45,471 --> 02:25:47,600
doses.
Occasionally he'd go in,

3245
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:49,970
you get your brains blown out and he 
come back,

3246
02:25:49,971 --> 02:25:52,190
sort of regroup.
Try to assess what,

3247
02:25:52,191 --> 02:25:54,350
if anything you could take out of that 
and learn,

3248
02:25:54,680 --> 02:25:55,513
get humbled by the fact that this exists
at all and then sort of try to reassess 

3249
02:25:59,571 --> 02:26:00,310
your life.

3250
02:26:00,310 --> 02:26:02,160
We talk about that a lot in stealing 
fire in that,

3251
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:03,910
in the book that's coming out in 
February,

3252
02:26:03,911 --> 02:26:08,911
whereas it seems like if you've never 
had any experiences with altered states,

3253
02:26:09,281 --> 02:26:09,730
with,
you know,

3254
02:26:09,730 --> 02:26:11,540
any of these flow states or you know,
whatever,

3255
02:26:12,610 --> 02:26:13,443
you need,
some kind of reality shattering first 

3256
02:26:16,271 --> 02:26:18,070
experience.
So just so you know,

3257
02:26:18,071 --> 02:26:18,904
that this domain exists and maybe go 
skydiving and have that kind of a flow 

3258
02:26:22,571 --> 02:26:23,404
state experience or you know,
do a psycho and then you need it less 

3259
02:26:26,141 --> 02:26:26,974
and less and less than you can get a lot
farther with less and there seems to be 

3260
02:26:32,081 --> 02:26:34,780
some something there with that.
What about

3261
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:37,780
the idea of mixing up a bunch of 
different modalities?

3262
02:26:37,781 --> 02:26:39,110
I mean,
is there any benefit in.

3263
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:39,810
Yeah,
that's.

3264
02:26:39,810 --> 02:26:41,450
So that's,
you're right.

3265
02:26:41,810 --> 02:26:45,290
What's interesting,
and this is when I'm really happy about,

3266
02:26:45,350 --> 02:26:46,580
and uh,
you know,

3267
02:26:46,581 --> 02:26:51,581
I was talking to a Rick Doblin if you 
had a longtime friend of mine.

3268
02:26:51,801 --> 02:26:53,750
I've known him for awhile.
He is so important.

3269
02:26:53,751 --> 02:26:54,531
Is Awesome.
Yeah,

3270
02:26:54,531 --> 02:26:55,460
he's a great,
great girl.

3271
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:57,740
He's dealing with maps is just so 
wonderful.

3272
02:26:57,750 --> 02:27:01,130
So huge.
So we were talking about,

3273
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:02,953
you know,
a psychedelic medicine at this point is 

3274
02:27:04,491 --> 02:27:05,240
kind of,
you know,

3275
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:06,800
everybody knows it's gone on,
but uh,

3276
02:27:06,801 --> 02:27:07,634
you know,
what's interesting going on at the 

3277
02:27:08,361 --> 02:27:10,940
cutting edge and it's so basic,
it's almost stupid.

3278
02:27:10,941 --> 02:27:13,490
You can't even believe this,
but lo and behold,

3279
02:27:13,491 --> 02:27:14,324
they're discovering that if you combine 
the occasional mtma session with 

3280
02:27:18,771 --> 02:27:21,770
meditation,
occasionally you get farther,

3281
02:27:21,771 --> 02:27:23,720
faster,
big surprise,

3282
02:27:23,721 --> 02:27:24,380
right?
Yeah.

3283
02:27:24,380 --> 02:27:25,970
I'm this and,
and,

3284
02:27:25,971 --> 02:27:28,760
and you know,
the truth of the matter is once you move

3285
02:27:28,761 --> 02:27:29,594
into these cultures effort,
he's blending state changing 

3286
02:27:32,091 --> 02:27:32,924
technologies.
You're using your martial arts for flow 

3287
02:27:34,971 --> 02:27:35,804
states.
You're using your yoga breathing 

3288
02:27:36,921 --> 02:27:39,170
techniques,
you're having the occasional psychedelic

3289
02:27:39,171 --> 02:27:42,230
experience at burning man.
Maybe you're smoking pot,

3290
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:42,830
blah,
blah.

3291
02:27:42,830 --> 02:27:43,663
I mean,
everybody's blending all this stuff 

3292
02:27:44,271 --> 02:27:45,104
together.
It's very rare that you find somebody 

3293
02:27:48,231 --> 02:27:48,921
who's like,
okay,

3294
02:27:48,921 --> 02:27:49,720
I,
I,

3295
02:27:49,720 --> 02:27:52,280
I only do one thing.
You know,

3296
02:27:52,460 --> 02:27:53,400
that they do.

3297
02:27:53,410 --> 02:27:56,340
If they're so rigid and they're probably
not getting the same benefits out of it,

3298
02:27:56,341 --> 02:27:59,120
that they would if they were just more 
open and loose about it.

3299
02:27:59,121 --> 02:27:59,954
I think that's probably true too.
I think there's so many different ways 

3300
02:28:02,071 --> 02:28:02,904
to endogenously a trigger,
these chemicals that I think we need to 

3301
02:28:09,751 --> 02:28:10,584
explore more and one of the ones that 
I've been talking about for so long and 

3302
02:28:13,881 --> 02:28:15,510
I've really never get off my ass and do 
it.

3303
02:28:15,930 --> 02:28:19,290
I've talked to so many people that get 
into Kundalini,

3304
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:21,830
couldn't any of that and that Kundalini 
Yoga,

3305
02:28:21,831 --> 02:28:25,160
once you practice it for long periods of
time and once you get really good at it,

3306
02:28:25,161 --> 02:28:25,994
you figure out a way or your brain 
figures out a way to access these 

3307
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:30,853
dimensions that you would normally only 
achieve if you were on psychedelic 

3308
02:28:33,981 --> 02:28:34,814
drugs.
States of minds that were very similar 

3309
02:28:37,821 --> 02:28:40,910
to the DMT state and you can do it 
through Kundalini Yoga,

3310
02:28:40,940 --> 02:28:45,560
but it 45 minutes of intense practice 
for long periods of time.

3311
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:46,700
Many,
many weeks in a row.

3312
02:28:46,701 --> 02:28:47,534
And then you can kind of get there.
I will say that in talking to a Brian 

3313
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:54,590
Mackenzie and layered with about their 
kind of what they're doing and it's this

3314
02:28:54,591 --> 02:28:55,424
blend of a kind of like box breathing 
coupled by sort of like the Wim Hoff 

3315
02:28:59,391 --> 02:29:02,400
protocol for the breathing protocol.
But they've,

3316
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:03,253
they've developed into a system,
they claim that they're getting full on 

3317
02:29:07,611 --> 02:29:08,444
dmt experiences.
Laird Hamilton's tripping balls lot 

3318
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:13,730
through the,
through the breath holding work.

3319
02:29:13,740 --> 02:29:14,573
Yeah.
I don't know if he said,

3320
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:16,820
I don't think he's doing the substance.
It doesn't have to.

3321
02:29:16,821 --> 02:29:17,654
I mean the brain produces the.
Which was one of the most fascinating 

3322
02:29:20,361 --> 02:29:21,194
thing about it,
the most potent psychedelic drug known 

3323
02:29:22,911 --> 02:29:24,710
to man.
And it's made in the body.

3324
02:29:25,450 --> 02:29:27,500
It's in pretty much every cell in your 
body.

3325
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:29,190
What it,
uh,

3326
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:34,840
maybe it was Mckenna.
He was probably was Dennis Dennis,

3327
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:35,713
who I think he pointed out that every 
one of us is walking around with enough 

3328
02:29:39,891 --> 02:29:42,290
of an illegal substance in our system to
go to jail forever.

3329
02:29:42,290 --> 02:29:44,890
You go buy an orange.
Yeah,

3330
02:29:44,960 --> 02:29:47,240
right.
There's enough dmt and an orange to send

3331
02:29:47,241 --> 02:29:49,220
you to jail for the rest of your life.
Is it real?

3332
02:29:49,221 --> 02:29:50,054
It's everywhere in orange.
I didn't even know they hadn't been 

3333
02:29:52,130 --> 02:29:53,420
oranges.
That's amazing.

3334
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:55,740
Yeah.
It's a weird drug when your whole.

3335
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:56,663
I mean,
it's like making saliva illegal or 

3336
02:29:57,771 --> 02:29:58,890
water.
It's,

3337
02:29:59,130 --> 02:30:01,190
it's so common.
It's very,

3338
02:30:01,191 --> 02:30:02,024
very strange.
But the fact that you can make your 

3339
02:30:04,101 --> 02:30:08,420
brain produce large dumps of it,
that you can figure out a way.

3340
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:11,060
And apparently Kundalini Yoga is the big
one.

3341
02:30:11,210 --> 02:30:13,730
That's interesting.
My wife practices Kundalini Yoga.

3342
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:15,320
I've never asked her.
She's tripping.

3343
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:16,513
No,
she hasn't.

3344
02:30:16,520 --> 02:30:18,900
She hasn't reported it.
She,

3345
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:21,110
I mean,
she certainly gets her into flow states.

3346
02:30:21,111 --> 02:30:22,750
Right story of my life.
Yeah,

3347
02:30:23,390 --> 02:30:25,030
it is a,
it.

3348
02:30:25,070 --> 02:30:27,890
I think what,
what we're saying before about marijuana

3349
02:30:27,891 --> 02:30:32,891
being legalized and the fact that it 
took until 2016 in California.

3350
02:30:33,410 --> 02:30:36,440
It's hilarious.
Really filled with folly.

3351
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:37,513
I really hope that this opens up the 
door to all these other non toxic drugs 

3352
02:30:41,481 --> 02:30:43,580
like,
like psilocybin,

3353
02:30:43,581 --> 02:30:44,414
which has this ridiculously high ld 50 
rate where you would literally have to 

3354
02:30:47,061 --> 02:30:49,780
eat pounds of it to die.
And I'm,

3355
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:50,623
I'm really hoping that we're going to 
get more and more research and more and 

3356
02:30:53,691 --> 02:30:54,524
more understanding things like I began 
that we were talking about before the 

3357
02:30:56,901 --> 02:30:58,640
podcast where,
um,

3358
02:30:58,700 --> 02:31:01,580
my friend Ed,
who has a center down in Mexico,

3359
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,780
he was hooked on pills and he got one to
Mexico,

3360
02:31:05,930 --> 02:31:06,763
took an,
uh,

3361
02:31:06,860 --> 02:31:10,220
went on Ibogaine trip,
completely cured him of his addiction to

3362
02:31:10,221 --> 02:31:11,054
opiates and now he runs the center and 
so many people that have had these 

3363
02:31:15,171 --> 02:31:16,004
problems with pills,
which is a gigantic problem in our 

3364
02:31:17,541 --> 02:31:19,250
culture today because they're so 
prevalent.

3365
02:31:19,710 --> 02:31:20,070
I think

3366
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:22,260
so much of that could be cured with 
Ibogaine,

3367
02:31:23,310 --> 02:31:24,550
the Ibogaine hair,
you know,

3368
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,640
opiate addiction research,
you know,

3369
02:31:26,641 --> 02:31:28,710
that's where the,
how the drug got interesting.

3370
02:31:28,711 --> 02:31:29,830
If people in the first place,
right?

3371
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:30,673
They going all called the movie back to 
the fifties or sixties when they first 

3372
02:31:33,601 --> 02:31:37,110
started realizing it.
I'm certainly,

3373
02:31:37,111 --> 02:31:37,944
I,
you know,

3374
02:31:38,550 --> 02:31:41,340
I just,
there's so many great questions that you

3375
02:31:41,341 --> 02:31:42,174
can start asking.
You can ask when we talk about 

3376
02:31:43,801 --> 02:31:45,150
consciousness earlier,
right there.

3377
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:48,950
These are phenomenally good tools.
And you know,

3378
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:49,990
I'm really,
uh,

3379
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:52,890
in stealing fire where you write about 
the work of Robin Card Harris,

3380
02:31:52,891 --> 02:31:53,724
who is the first person to use f Mri to 
do visualizations of the brain on 

3381
02:31:58,681 --> 02:32:00,510
psychedelics.
So we now know what the brain looks like

3382
02:32:00,511 --> 02:32:02,340
on Lsd.
We know what the world looks like on,

3383
02:32:02,750 --> 02:32:04,020
you know,
psilocybin as he says,

3384
02:32:04,290 --> 02:32:04,951
we're,
you know,

3385
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:08,160
we're starting to understand where all 
this mind expansion is coming from.

3386
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:09,230
And we actually,
you know,

3387
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:11,430
the heightened creativity that we've 
been talking about,

3388
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:14,550
we now know what that looks like and why
that happens.

3389
02:32:14,790 --> 02:32:15,623
I think we're at the front edge of 
starting to ask the interesting 

3390
02:32:18,211 --> 02:32:19,320
questions,
right?

3391
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:22,290
A lot of what we've done in,
in kind of psychedelic research,

3392
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:23,333
you know,
in this renaissance that we're going 

3393
02:32:24,061 --> 02:32:24,894
through is rerun all the experiments 
they ran back in the sixties and 

3394
02:32:28,351 --> 02:32:29,184
fifties,
right?

3395
02:32:29,310 --> 02:32:32,220
Because nobody trusts those damn hippies
in their research.

3396
02:32:32,510 --> 02:32:35,400
So we've just done a lot of that work.
Yes,

3397
02:32:35,401 --> 02:32:38,070
we've done it more rigorously and was 
slightly better tools.

3398
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:39,690
But if you think about,
you know,

3399
02:32:39,750 --> 02:32:43,320
the classic suicide instead of the Good 
Friday experiment,

3400
02:32:43,660 --> 02:32:44,493
you know,
it was done in the marsh chapel in 1962 

3401
02:32:49,650 --> 02:32:51,810
and this was,
this was the first study that said,

3402
02:32:51,811 --> 02:32:52,644
hey,
do psychedelics produce valid quote 

3403
02:32:55,171 --> 02:32:57,330
unquote mystical experiences.
Right.

3404
02:32:57,331 --> 02:32:57,940
And the and the,
the,

3405
02:32:57,940 --> 02:32:58,773
the study and then Rick Doblin redid it 
and then Roland Griffith at Johns 

3406
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:04,253
Hopkins read it and then it's been.
So this one study has been redone four 

3407
02:33:09,181 --> 02:33:10,014
times to get the exact same result 
because nobody wants to believe it 

3408
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:13,703
because they don't trust me because 
these substances are so volatile and 

3409
02:33:15,511 --> 02:33:17,310
scare,
scare us so much.

3410
02:33:17,950 --> 02:33:18,783
Well not in.
Here's one thing I think also to suck 

3411
02:33:20,830 --> 02:33:21,663
the concentrate on not just substances 
but also states of mind that can be 

3412
02:33:24,491 --> 02:33:26,590
achieved consciously,
like on purpose,

3413
02:33:26,591 --> 02:33:27,424
like mindfulness,
like concentrating on being in the 

3414
02:33:30,191 --> 02:33:33,910
moment like that.
You can alter the way you view the world

3415
02:33:34,090 --> 02:33:37,290
by the way you concentrate on the actual
moment that you,

3416
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:38,530
you're existing in right now.

3417
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:40,353
Her.
Sure.

3418
02:33:40,480 --> 02:33:41,313
It also,
the combination of stuff as you brought 

3419
02:33:43,631 --> 02:33:46,450
up is where also this is going to start 
to get interesting when you,

3420
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:50,260
when we start really figuring out how to
skillfully blend these things together,

3421
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:53,380
turn them into protocols to that stuff.
A little bit of

3422
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:55,050
Dma,
a little bit of meditation.

3423
02:33:56,470 --> 02:33:57,303
Yeah.
A little bit of this for flow a little 

3424
02:33:59,351 --> 02:33:59,640
bit.
Uh,

3425
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:01,330
you know,
and the other thing is,

3426
02:34:01,390 --> 02:34:02,223
you know,
psychedelics are the technology we're 

3427
02:34:05,411 --> 02:34:06,244
talking about most now,
but most of these things are achievable 

3428
02:34:08,411 --> 02:34:10,500
with actual technology,
right?

3429
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:11,413
Do you know,
different than.

3430
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:15,250
And we're going to get more of that.
For example,

3431
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:18,700
there's a company called Palo Alto 
Neuroscience,

3432
02:34:18,970 --> 02:34:20,200
Palo Alto,
neuroscience,

3433
02:34:20,201 --> 02:34:22,570
and this is early stages,
so we're not there yet,

3434
02:34:22,571 --> 02:34:26,990
but what they're working towards 
figuring out is say you are a trained to

3435
02:34:26,991 --> 02:34:31,080
Benton Lama and you can meditate and 
drop your brain down to that Alpha Theta

3436
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:35,120
borderline.
They can record various biomarkers,

3437
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:36,690
galvanic skin response,
you know,

3438
02:34:36,730 --> 02:34:37,563
a couple of these,
a bunch of other things while you're in 

3439
02:34:40,271 --> 02:34:41,104
that meditative state.
And then they can take that recording 

3440
02:34:43,630 --> 02:34:44,463
and an egg,
put it on somebody who's an absolute 

3441
02:34:46,481 --> 02:34:51,481
novice and use that as neurofeedback to 
guide somebody else into your state,

3442
02:34:52,660 --> 02:34:53,860
into the state you were in.

3443
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:56,590
This is worth the front edge of that.
Right?

3444
02:34:56,890 --> 02:34:57,723
But more and more,
this is really starting to come some of 

3445
02:35:02,081 --> 02:35:03,130
this stuff with,
you know,

3446
02:35:03,131 --> 02:35:03,964
with flow states.
We've got use neurofeedback to drive 

3447
02:35:07,271 --> 02:35:08,104
people in the flow.
That's all the work that Chris Burkard 

3448
02:35:09,361 --> 02:35:12,790
did it advanced brain monitoring and I 
don't know if you've seen her ted talk.

3449
02:35:13,670 --> 02:35:14,503
She's got a great ted talk.
She did a lot of work with the navy on 

3450
02:35:16,331 --> 02:35:17,230
it.
So you know,

3451
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:18,093
we're using,
we've got technology that'll drive you 

3452
02:35:19,481 --> 02:35:21,490
into flow.
We've got technology that is going to be

3453
02:35:21,491 --> 02:35:23,020
able to mimic.
So I mean,

3454
02:35:23,021 --> 02:35:24,940
you know,
right now today,

3455
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:29,040
2016,
we're talking about psychedelics and you

3456
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:31,810
know,
these pills that affect these molecules.

3457
02:35:31,811 --> 02:35:33,640
But we've got technology coming that's 
coming,

3458
02:35:33,641 --> 02:35:34,540
that's letting us,
you know,

3459
02:35:34,541 --> 02:35:36,310
just to interface directly with the 
brain.

3460
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:40,240
And that's coming.
So I'm a little confused.

3461
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:44,410
How are you experiencing someone else's 
flow state?

3462
02:35:44,470 --> 02:35:49,000
What is the mechanism like if someone,
if they're recording something.

3463
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:49,893
Oh,
I'm sorry,

3464
02:35:50,090 --> 02:35:52,330
a,
what would Chris Burke and what the guys

3465
02:35:52,331 --> 02:35:55,020
did it.
Advanced brain monitoring is there.

3466
02:35:55,070 --> 02:35:57,220
We're working with archers for example,
marksman,

3467
02:35:57,440 --> 02:35:58,273
um,
but they will record kind of what is 

3468
02:36:00,431 --> 02:36:01,264
going on in the brain of an expert 
marksman as at the moment they're drawn 

3469
02:36:04,750 --> 02:36:05,890
and firing,
right?

3470
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:06,993
And then they're using neurofeedback 
with other participants to drive them 

3471
02:36:12,011 --> 02:36:12,844
toward that same brain wave state.
And what they've done is they've cut 

3472
02:36:15,761 --> 02:36:18,910
learning times in half.
So let me do it.

3473
02:36:18,970 --> 02:36:21,700
They can,
you can train up an APP.

3474
02:36:21,701 --> 02:36:22,534
They've managed to train up absolute 
novices to expert performance and 50 

3475
02:36:26,171 --> 02:36:31,171
percent less time using using this and,
but what are the novices experiencing?

3476
02:36:31,960 --> 02:36:34,300
Like what,
what are they doing to them?

3477
02:36:35,110 --> 02:36:38,050
They're novices are just using 
neurofeedback,

3478
02:36:38,051 --> 02:36:38,350
right?

3479
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:40,900
So what does that mean though?
A neurofeedback means,

3480
02:36:41,440 --> 02:36:42,273
I don't know how our system.
I can't remember exactly how our system 

3481
02:36:45,161 --> 02:36:46,600
works.
We will have to pull up the ted talks so

3482
02:36:46,601 --> 02:36:48,310
I can see it again.
But uh,

3483
02:36:49,030 --> 02:36:50,410
let's say it's a tone,
right?

3484
02:36:50,411 --> 02:36:51,244
Let's like let's say expert performance 
takes place at this borderline Alpha 

3485
02:36:55,240 --> 02:36:56,073
Theta borderline brainwave wise.
There's a whole bunch of other things 

3486
02:36:57,431 --> 02:36:59,920
going on and being just crunching it 
down,

3487
02:36:59,921 --> 02:37:00,754
but you know when you're closer to there
you hear a low pitch sound and when 

3488
02:37:05,861 --> 02:37:06,694
you're farther away,
the pitch gets higher and higher and 

3489
02:37:08,141 --> 02:37:09,370
higher,
so you just,

3490
02:37:09,550 --> 02:37:11,580
you don't know what you're aiming for.
Ed's brainwaves,

3491
02:37:11,590 --> 02:37:13,750
you can't control your brainwaves 
consciously,

3492
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:16,320
but just by providing the feedback and 
none,

3493
02:37:16,321 --> 02:37:17,600
oh,
this is the wrong state of this,

3494
02:37:17,601 --> 02:37:20,090
is the right to your brain will start to
learn.

3495
02:37:20,091 --> 02:37:22,790
That's how neurofeedback works with 
trains.

3496
02:37:22,791 --> 02:37:27,791
You just trains your brain to move to 
this brainwave state just by giving it a

3497
02:37:28,041 --> 02:37:30,080
little bit of a little feedback loop to 
playoff

3498
02:37:30,390 --> 02:37:31,223
and doing this during the actual 
activity itself is what accentuates the 

3499
02:37:34,861 --> 02:37:37,470
learning.
So are they doing the archery themselves

3500
02:37:37,471 --> 02:37:40,560
while they're being inundated with these
tones?

3501
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:42,240
Yes.
Wow,

3502
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:43,583
that's fascinating.
So they're not even consciously 

3503
02:37:45,541 --> 02:37:47,880
thinking.
What I've always wondered,

3504
02:37:47,970 --> 02:37:49,890
and this is why I'm bringing this up,
I've always wondered,

3505
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:53,160
how far away are we from actually 
recording memories?

3506
02:37:53,310 --> 02:37:54,143
Like you say,
if you decided to get on your snowboard 

3507
02:37:57,540 --> 02:37:58,373
and go down a mountain and you're 
wearing some sort of a device or some 

3508
02:38:02,190 --> 02:38:03,023
you're interfacing with some sort of 
device that can record all of your 

3509
02:38:05,731 --> 02:38:07,410
physical experiences,
your emotions,

3510
02:38:07,411 --> 02:38:08,900
your nerves,
your immune.

3511
02:38:08,940 --> 02:38:11,270
You might slip a little bit and have a 
little little,

3512
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:12,113
little,
little scary moment and that that also 

3513
02:38:14,761 --> 02:38:15,594
can be related and those memories and 
then someone else going to be sitting 

3514
02:38:17,971 --> 02:38:18,804
here.
You can put your whatever device it is 

3515
02:38:21,601 --> 02:38:22,434
on them and they can interface with your
memory and they could experience your 

3516
02:38:26,281 --> 02:38:27,180
memory.
I mean,

3517
02:38:27,181 --> 02:38:28,970
how far away are we from doing 
something?

3518
02:38:29,020 --> 02:38:29,853
I feel like that I don't know.
My friend Selena smell and he does this 

3519
02:38:32,441 --> 02:38:33,274
in a speech he gave a and I'm going to.
I'm blanking the name of the company 

3520
02:38:37,151 --> 02:38:41,440
that's doing this,
but they are trying to figure out how to

3521
02:38:41,441 --> 02:38:45,370
record what goes on in the visual cortex
while you dream.

3522
02:38:45,730 --> 02:38:46,563
Oh,
so their ultimate goal is to be able to 

3523
02:38:47,651 --> 02:38:48,484
play your dreams but get arrested.
What if you get arrested for your 

3524
02:38:50,441 --> 02:38:51,274
dreams?
If you're doing horrible shit and your 

3525
02:38:52,181 --> 02:38:53,014
dreams,
this is precog right where you were in 

3526
02:38:55,451 --> 02:38:57,250
minority report.
It's happening.

3527
02:38:58,720 --> 02:38:59,560
Well,
we've got,

3528
02:38:59,620 --> 02:39:02,710
you know,
you can now go to jail in what should be

3529
02:39:02,711 --> 02:39:06,790
fined $250,000
in New York for using the wrong pronoun.

3530
02:39:08,200 --> 02:39:09,910
So that's probably coming to.
Yeah,

3531
02:39:10,310 --> 02:39:11,780
I would imagine.
I mean,

3532
02:39:11,900 --> 02:39:12,733
if you really can find the people who 
have a higher propensity for violence 

3533
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:15,921
and they,
you know,

3534
02:39:15,921 --> 02:39:16,754
they're,
they're closer to committing violent 

3535
02:39:17,751 --> 02:39:19,760
crimes.
They haven't done it yet,

3536
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:21,570
but they're pretty close.
Well,

3537
02:39:21,580 --> 02:39:23,130
what do you mean?
We talked about this earlier,

3538
02:39:23,180 --> 02:39:27,170
what do you do with the five percent of 
the population that is sociopathic?

3539
02:39:27,200 --> 02:39:28,160
Yeah.
What do you do?

3540
02:39:28,460 --> 02:39:31,100
It's a good question.
Hitler had a couple of ideas.

3541
02:39:31,680 --> 02:39:32,580
I don't think,
uh,

3542
02:39:32,810 --> 02:39:34,010
I don't think that's the way we should 
go.

3543
02:39:34,460 --> 02:39:35,160
I think

3544
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:36,900
maybe there's a way to fix them.
I mean,

3545
02:39:36,901 --> 02:39:37,734
maybe a cognitive research is going to 
lead down past where you can understand 

3546
02:39:41,431 --> 02:39:44,130
how to,
how to increase empathy.

3547
02:39:44,190 --> 02:39:44,611
Well,
yeah.

3548
02:39:44,611 --> 02:39:47,190
I was going to say how to cause it,
you know,

3549
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:51,450
how to actually unlock it.
Maybe there's some sort of a biochemical

3550
02:39:51,451 --> 02:39:52,284
roadblock in the mind and they can 
figure out how to unleash that and make 

3551
02:39:55,441 --> 02:39:59,910
people understand what it is that their 
actions do to other people and have them

3552
02:39:59,911 --> 02:40:01,070
feel it.
You know,

3553
02:40:01,080 --> 02:40:03,420
for whatever reason,
if someone doesn't feel empathy,

3554
02:40:03,440 --> 02:40:05,850
it doesn't have any feelings for anybody
else other than themselves.

3555
02:40:06,120 --> 02:40:06,953
There's a lot of people amongst us that 
they believe are just acting like they 

3556
02:40:10,081 --> 02:40:10,914
care.
Like they're mimicking actual emotions 

3557
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:14,040
and I think we've been around.

3558
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:16,380
I think you've probably been around 
people like that and it's weird,

3559
02:40:16,440 --> 02:40:17,171
you know,
like you'll,

3560
02:40:17,171 --> 02:40:21,090
they'll talk about something,
some horrible tragedy and they have some

3561
02:40:21,091 --> 02:40:21,924
weird sort of disingenuous take on it 
and it's just very awkward and you're 

3562
02:40:26,701 --> 02:40:27,031
like,
well,

3563
02:40:27,031 --> 02:40:28,260
I think that guy's a robot.
You know?

3564
02:40:28,261 --> 02:40:29,580
And then you get out of there and you're
like,

3565
02:40:29,581 --> 02:40:31,400
I think we might've been around a 
sociopath.

3566
02:40:31,840 --> 02:40:34,170
You know,
that someone doesn't feel it.

3567
02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:35,093
They just don't feel it.
Maybe there's something in the brain 

3568
02:40:36,241 --> 02:40:38,460
that can be unlocked and we could 
eliminate that.

3569
02:40:38,560 --> 02:40:40,830
It might be as simple as,
you know,

3570
02:40:40,831 --> 02:40:45,270
like some people have asberger's,
some people have Alzheimer's,

3571
02:40:45,280 --> 02:40:46,113
some,
maybe some people have a lack of 

3572
02:40:47,401 --> 02:40:48,930
empathy.
Maybe there's a doorway.

3573
02:40:48,970 --> 02:40:49,890
Well,
for sure they've,

3574
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:52,610
they're having some success.
You know,

3575
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:53,453
this is anybody on the spectrum of 
autism and asperger's empathy's in 

3576
02:40:57,320 --> 02:40:57,990
issue,
right?

3577
02:40:57,990 --> 02:40:58,801
Yeah.
Um,

3578
02:40:58,801 --> 02:40:59,311
and it,
you know,

3579
02:40:59,311 --> 02:41:02,070
a lot of that is their mirror neurons 
aren't mirror owings,

3580
02:41:02,130 --> 02:41:03,610
so they're not,
um,

3581
02:41:03,940 --> 02:41:04,773
that.
The last time I said that out loud in 

3582
02:41:05,731 --> 02:41:07,710
public,
I got screamed at for a very,

3583
02:41:07,711 --> 02:41:08,544
very long time.
Somebody screamed at you seems to be 

3584
02:41:09,931 --> 02:41:10,930
fairly well established.
I was,

3585
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:11,873
well,
I wrote a little bit about autism in a 

3586
02:41:12,840 --> 02:41:13,673
small,
furry prayer and people whose people 

3587
02:41:15,361 --> 02:41:18,660
really got upset when I,
when I said,

3588
02:41:18,710 --> 02:41:19,543
you know,
one of the things is going on with 

3589
02:41:20,101 --> 02:41:20,934
autism,
whether we think is that your mirror 

3590
02:41:21,781 --> 02:41:24,830
neurons are mirroring,
you can't,

3591
02:41:24,920 --> 02:41:25,753
you're not reading facial expressions 
and emotions in people in that 

3592
02:41:28,741 --> 02:41:30,270
community.
Got very upset with me.

3593
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:31,620
Why?
I don't know.

3594
02:41:31,790 --> 02:41:35,490
But it was this established science 
pretty much at this point.

3595
02:41:35,491 --> 02:41:38,220
Yeah.
Sexual was baron cone and you know,

3596
02:41:38,240 --> 02:41:39,450
he's,
he's a smart dude.

3597
02:41:39,730 --> 02:41:41,580
Um,
their take was,

3598
02:41:41,581 --> 02:41:43,920
I was wrong and I shouldn't be talking 
about it in public.

3599
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:45,990
Sacha Baron Cohen,
the not,

3600
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:46,531
not,
no,

3601
02:41:46,531 --> 02:41:46,981
no,
no.

3602
02:41:46,981 --> 02:41:49,140
He's a.
no,

3603
02:41:49,141 --> 02:41:50,670
not boring.
Same name.

3604
02:41:51,390 --> 02:41:53,520
Neuroscientists.
So he was upset at you?

3605
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:54,360
No,
no.

3606
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:55,193
He was the guy who did the research and 
so he feels no people in the people in 

3607
02:41:59,341 --> 02:42:00,930
that community.
I got,

3608
02:42:01,650 --> 02:42:05,760
I got letters and email and things along
those lines.

3609
02:42:05,761 --> 02:42:08,580
People posted stuff online.
They were offended that I had.

3610
02:42:08,670 --> 02:42:11,310
I had written about their disease 
apparently.

3611
02:42:11,820 --> 02:42:14,460
Just because you had written about it 
and you don't suffer from it.

3612
02:42:14,610 --> 02:42:14,980
Yeah,
I,

3613
02:42:14,980 --> 02:42:15,720
I,
I,

3614
02:42:15,720 --> 02:42:16,553
I,
you're asking big why questions and I 

3615
02:42:18,351 --> 02:42:20,430
can answer them,
but I don't know.

3616
02:42:22,530 --> 02:42:24,030
That's weird.
I thought so too.

3617
02:42:24,060 --> 02:42:24,940
Yeah.
Because if,

3618
02:42:24,970 --> 02:42:25,803
if some established neuroscientists has 
made some sort of a connection between 

3619
02:42:28,951 --> 02:42:31,800
that issue and you know,
you're not allowed to discuss it.

3620
02:42:31,801 --> 02:42:33,880
That seems really bizarre.
There's a,

3621
02:42:34,160 --> 02:42:36,030
there's a lot of that garden room.
Yeah.

3622
02:42:36,031 --> 02:42:40,050
There's a lot of that going around it.
I think there's also a,

3623
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:42,620
obviously they call it the spectrum.
You know,

3624
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:43,690
for a reason,
you know,

3625
02:42:43,710 --> 02:42:44,543
when you say someone's on the spectrum,
I mean I know people that are probably 

3626
02:42:47,461 --> 02:42:48,294
mildly autistic,
that I know some folks that are just 

3627
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:52,860
Gonzo full blown,
you know,

3628
02:42:53,430 --> 02:42:54,880
so the prop,
you know,

3629
02:42:55,110 --> 02:42:55,943
it's some people that were,
they don't recognize that in themselves 

3630
02:42:58,081 --> 02:43:01,370
or maybe they don't want to admit it.
You know,

3631
02:43:01,380 --> 02:43:04,550
I spent a lot of time in silicon valley 
where there's a lot of that,

3632
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:05,800
a lot of that.
And you know,

3633
02:43:05,820 --> 02:43:09,440
in fact normally used to be,
you know,

3634
02:43:09,450 --> 02:43:11,320
if you were on the spectrum,
you weren't

3635
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:13,750
procreating as much.
Right.

3636
02:43:14,080 --> 02:43:16,420
But in Silicon Valley they're rich,
they're rich,

3637
02:43:16,450 --> 02:43:20,280
they're on the spectrum and they're 
banging hot up there.

3638
02:43:20,330 --> 02:43:21,163
A couple of nuts.
So it's one autistic people are having 

3639
02:43:22,691 --> 02:43:25,960
sex with other autistic animals.
One of the places we're looking at their

3640
02:43:25,961 --> 02:43:28,000
phone.
It's an interesting question because one

3641
02:43:28,001 --> 02:43:28,420
of the,
I mean,

3642
02:43:28,420 --> 02:43:32,530
one of the questions that this raises is
will it start to splinter the species?

3643
02:43:32,531 --> 02:43:34,420
Are we looking when that starts 
happening,

3644
02:43:34,450 --> 02:43:35,283
are you looking at a new that like the 
first step towards something because 

3645
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,570
there's definitely something going on 
differently in their brains.

3646
02:43:43,571 --> 02:43:44,404
They can.
There's all kinds of superpowers and 

3647
02:43:45,701 --> 02:43:48,160
there's all kinds of limitations right 
on.

3648
02:43:48,840 --> 02:43:49,540
It's,
you know,

3649
02:43:49,540 --> 02:43:52,300
it doesn't take much to start 
speciation.

3650
02:43:52,520 --> 02:43:53,353
Hm.
Well,

3651
02:43:53,750 --> 02:43:55,850
totally a good point because if you 
think about it,

3652
02:43:55,851 --> 02:43:56,684
at one point in time we had to develop 
emotions and empathy in order to unite 

3653
02:44:00,741 --> 02:44:03,500
ourselves and to stayed together 
connected in the community.

3654
02:44:03,830 --> 02:44:05,780
But uh,
other animals don't have that.

3655
02:44:05,781 --> 02:44:07,750
Like ants don't have.
That was the,

3656
02:44:07,790 --> 02:44:08,830
as far as we know,
right.

3657
02:44:08,900 --> 02:44:09,650
You know,
they,

3658
02:44:09,650 --> 02:44:10,483
they seem to be pretty robotic and they 
also don't have any free will 

3659
02:44:12,831 --> 02:44:13,664
whatsoever,
which is why they have those crazy aunt 

3660
02:44:15,261 --> 02:44:18,020
spirals where they never seen the ant 
death spiral.

3661
02:44:18,270 --> 02:44:21,380
Never seen that.
What happens is the female,

3662
02:44:21,440 --> 02:44:22,273
somehow or another we'll get separated 
from the rest of the colony and the 

3663
02:44:26,151 --> 02:44:30,620
males are still trying to follow the 
female scent and they can't follow it.

3664
02:44:30,621 --> 02:44:31,454
So they're following each other and they
follow each other and what looks like a 

3665
02:44:33,561 --> 02:44:37,190
hurricane where there's an eye of a 
hurricane and the center and it's an ant

3666
02:44:37,191 --> 02:44:39,050
death spiral.
See that right there.

3667
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:40,613
See though they're spinning around in a 
circle and they will do that until they 

3668
02:44:42,981 --> 02:44:44,660
die.
Wow.

3669
02:44:44,750 --> 02:44:45,583
Yeah.
They can't find the female for the 

3670
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:47,233
Queen.
They can't find the queen and they're 

3671
02:44:48,621 --> 02:44:51,530
confused.
There's some sort of a disruption in the

3672
02:44:51,531 --> 02:44:53,390
signal that they get the pheromones that
they've.

3673
02:44:53,960 --> 02:44:56,630
They're getting and they're just 
wandering around all fucking crazy.

3674
02:44:56,930 --> 02:44:59,010
And the ones in that center,
I mean that.

3675
02:44:59,160 --> 02:45:02,780
That mimics exactly what a hurricane 
looks like.

3676
02:45:02,820 --> 02:45:03,653
Yeah.

3677
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:06,280
Nuts.
That's interesting.

3678
02:45:06,480 --> 02:45:08,200
Yeah.
Non Empathetic.

3679
02:45:08,201 --> 02:45:11,830
Little no fucking free will have in 
bitches who do you to circle?

3680
02:45:11,890 --> 02:45:13,540
Nothing.
They're important here in an hater.

3681
02:45:13,780 --> 02:45:16,420
I'm a lover of ants because without them
we wouldn't be alive.

3682
02:45:16,421 --> 02:45:17,254
I'm just joking around.
There's as much biomass of ants as all 

3683
02:45:20,921 --> 02:45:22,780
the other animals combined.
It's awesome,

3684
02:45:22,781 --> 02:45:23,770
right?
Think of that.

3685
02:45:24,460 --> 02:45:25,820
Yeah.
Are.

3686
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:28,600
It's a weird animal,
but they exist alongside us,

3687
02:45:28,601 --> 02:45:30,700
but they have completely different rules
of engagement.

3688
02:45:31,300 --> 02:45:31,961
You know,
their,

3689
02:45:31,961 --> 02:45:36,280
their world is very strange and almost 
almost like mechanical.

3690
02:45:36,550 --> 02:45:40,270
They're almost like some weird bio 
mechanisms,

3691
02:45:40,300 --> 02:45:42,070
you know,
she was like,

3692
02:45:42,290 --> 02:45:43,900
it's a collective consciousness,
right?

3693
02:45:43,901 --> 02:45:46,770
It's a shared consciousness,
which,

3694
02:45:46,830 --> 02:45:47,663
you know,

3695
02:45:49,110 --> 02:45:51,330
how do you even Grok that?
How do you get your head around that?

3696
02:45:51,960 --> 02:45:53,520
Well,
in our little world,

3697
02:45:53,521 --> 02:45:55,380
I don't think we have,
you know,

3698
02:45:55,381 --> 02:45:56,970
but we step on them.
We don't mind,

3699
02:45:57,330 --> 02:45:57,871
you know,
they're,

3700
02:45:57,871 --> 02:45:59,560
there's so little.
We don't mind squishing them.

3701
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:03,030
Like you can squish them in your kitchen
and you just brush them off your pants.

3702
02:46:03,300 --> 02:46:05,610
Like if you kill an ant on your pants 
and your kitchen,

3703
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:08,910
like most people don't pick that fucker 
up and he just let it drop to the,

3704
02:46:10,580 --> 02:46:12,590
to the proper burial you think?
Yeah.

3705
02:46:12,591 --> 02:46:13,424
You don't dig a hole and say your 
prayers and light a candle and put up a 

3706
02:46:16,461 --> 02:46:18,070
picture of the amt before it died.
No,

3707
02:46:18,260 --> 02:46:20,150
be weird if I did that too.
It would.

3708
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:22,730
But there's a certain size,
like if you,

3709
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:27,380
if you kill the tiniest little Gnat,
you're not really gonna do anything with

3710
02:46:27,381 --> 02:46:29,570
the body.
But if you stop a rat,

3711
02:46:29,940 --> 02:46:31,580
he had to clean that up.
You can dispose it.

3712
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:32,301
Yeah.
We,

3713
02:46:32,301 --> 02:46:33,134
we,
you know,

3714
02:46:33,770 --> 02:46:35,060
there's a line.
Yeah,

3715
02:46:35,061 --> 02:46:35,894
there's lines is a biomass line where 
animals become like super significant 

3716
02:46:40,071 --> 02:46:40,970
and important to us.

3717
02:46:42,610 --> 02:46:46,720
That's interesting.
You think it's totally size related?

3718
02:46:46,780 --> 02:46:50,410
It's some of it's size related,
but it's also a appearance.

3719
02:46:50,870 --> 02:46:55,030
We like little cute mice more than we 
like big fucking scary spiders.

3720
02:46:55,440 --> 02:46:58,180
Is he a big scary spider?
Crush that fucker with a hammer.

3721
02:46:58,340 --> 02:47:00,120
And I really liked spiders.
Oh yeah.

3722
02:47:00,430 --> 02:47:02,830
One of those weird guys.
Yeah.

3723
02:47:02,920 --> 02:47:03,753
I mean most people don't.
Most people suffer from at least some 

3724
02:47:06,041 --> 02:47:06,874
form of Arachnophobia where they see 
some creepy spider walking tours and be 

3725
02:47:09,421 --> 02:47:10,254
like,
ah,

3726
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:12,160
because not a lot of spiders will kill 
you.

3727
02:47:12,460 --> 02:47:13,293
It's true.
We go specifically out hunting for like 

3728
02:47:15,641 --> 02:47:19,170
the Tarantula migrations in New Mexico.
Do you really know when that's going on?

3729
02:47:19,280 --> 02:47:21,250
It's really cool if you've never seen 
it,

3730
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:23,470
you can see if you go to pinnacle's 
National Monument,

3731
02:47:23,471 --> 02:47:26,350
which is up kind of around Gilroy,
um,

3732
02:47:26,590 --> 02:47:28,720
you can see them.
They have trashed on migrations up there

3733
02:47:28,721 --> 02:47:29,620
too.
And it's amazing.

3734
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:33,160
Just huge column.
How many of them?

3735
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:35,500
Hundreds.
Hundreds of Tarantulas.

3736
02:47:36,730 --> 02:47:39,460
You freaking out.
Jamie has got a rack to phobia.

3737
02:47:39,461 --> 02:47:40,880
Look at him.
He's covered his mouth through.

3738
02:47:40,900 --> 02:47:43,740
Throw up who that he's like,
like you've seen a vampire.

3739
02:47:43,780 --> 02:47:45,720
Did you pull up?
You pull up a tranche.

3740
02:47:45,730 --> 02:47:48,910
The migration.
He's terrified.

3741
02:47:48,940 --> 02:47:49,773
Look at him.
He's literally covering his mouth like 

3742
02:47:51,191 --> 02:47:52,360
they're pulling out.
Cross on them.

3743
02:47:55,080 --> 02:47:57,180
My favorite spiders,
that Brazilian wondering spider.

3744
02:47:57,181 --> 02:48:00,510
You don't want that one.
It bites you.

3745
02:48:00,820 --> 02:48:01,653
It stings you,
and it gives you a raging hard on that 

3746
02:48:05,161 --> 02:48:07,800
will kill you and if it doesn't kill 
you,

3747
02:48:07,830 --> 02:48:11,790
your Dick is broken.
You'll it will break your sexuality will

3748
02:48:11,791 --> 02:48:14,860
literally wreck your Dick like a fucking
ballpark,

3749
02:48:14,880 --> 02:48:17,250
frank,
that you left on a on a,

3750
02:48:17,790 --> 02:48:19,830
on a grill for too long.
You know they plump.

3751
02:48:19,831 --> 02:48:20,970
When you cook them,
then they pop.

3752
02:48:21,330 --> 02:48:22,410
Yeah,
that's your Dick.

3753
02:48:22,740 --> 02:48:23,573
It literally,
it makes your body somehow or another 

3754
02:48:25,801 --> 02:48:30,040
through it's injection of venom,
makes your body have this overflowing.

3755
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:32,790
What is the name of the alien wandering 
spider?

3756
02:48:33,160 --> 02:48:37,050
Why it's doing that?
Why does it have a scarier name?

3757
02:48:37,150 --> 02:48:37,471
No,
no.

3758
02:48:37,471 --> 02:48:38,550
Right?
That's what I'm saying.

3759
02:48:38,630 --> 02:48:40,290
It's scary looking,
but um,

3760
02:48:40,410 --> 02:48:41,243
they're looking at it for a,
an erectile dysfunction drug because 

3761
02:48:44,371 --> 02:48:45,204
it's a,
it's so fucking potent and it makes 

3762
02:48:47,340 --> 02:48:48,930
Viagra like a joke.

3763
02:48:49,090 --> 02:48:49,990
Jesus.
Yeah.

3764
02:48:49,991 --> 02:48:51,390
That's interesting.
Fascinating.

3765
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:52,313
Yeah.
And it apparently does it to all the 

3766
02:48:53,731 --> 02:48:54,564
muscles in your body.
It's something to do with everything 

3767
02:48:56,131 --> 02:48:56,860
goes Richard.
Yeah.

3768
02:48:56,860 --> 02:48:59,300
Something to do with nitric oxide,
nitric,

3769
02:48:59,550 --> 02:49:03,270
nitric or nitrix one of those and did a,
you know,

3770
02:49:03,271 --> 02:49:06,150
the same sort of stuff that exists in,
you know,

3771
02:49:06,151 --> 02:49:06,984
like,
um,

3772
02:49:07,040 --> 02:49:07,740
those,
uh,

3773
02:49:07,740 --> 02:49:10,680
pump up workout pre,
pre workout formulas.

3774
02:49:10,681 --> 02:49:12,760
It give people all this energy and pump 
your muscles up.

3775
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:14,093
Yeah,
it does.

3776
02:49:14,100 --> 02:49:18,900
That nitric oxide has some sort of an 
effect on muscles and it's also the same

3777
02:49:18,901 --> 02:49:21,090
sort of an effect that you get from 
taking a Viagra,

3778
02:49:21,091 --> 02:49:24,360
which is why those vasodilators are 
illegal in the Olympics.

3779
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:29,100
You can't take Viagra has a performance 
enhancing effect on muscular.

3780
02:49:29,250 --> 02:49:30,720
Like I did not know that.
Muscular.

3781
02:49:30,760 --> 02:49:31,890
That's important.
Yeah.

3782
02:49:32,100 --> 02:49:34,540
It's illegal in the Olympics.
I had no idea.

3783
02:49:34,600 --> 02:49:35,580
Yeah.
I'm by Agra.

3784
02:49:35,581 --> 02:49:36,414
It actually enhances endurance.
That's the reason why you get so much 

3785
02:49:39,030 --> 02:49:41,560
blood flow to your penis is because you 
know,

3786
02:49:41,630 --> 02:49:44,280
you just got this crazy blood flow 
throughout all your muscles,

3787
02:49:44,281 --> 02:49:46,290
so it gives you more strength and more 
endurance.

3788
02:49:46,760 --> 02:49:47,593
Uh,
I don't know how much of it is digital 

3789
02:49:48,641 --> 02:49:50,490
boost energy?
It's a good question.

3790
02:49:50,590 --> 02:49:52,800
It's a good question.
I'd have to look into it.

3791
02:49:52,890 --> 02:49:57,170
But this Brazilian wondering spider 
apparently that times a fucking thousand

3792
02:49:57,690 --> 02:49:58,523
and 11.

3793
02:49:58,910 --> 02:50:00,180
Funny,
funny story.

3794
02:50:00,760 --> 02:50:03,710
I did some work with a woman named 
Patricia Wright.

3795
02:50:03,711 --> 02:50:06,170
She's a macarthur genius award winning 
conservationists.

3796
02:50:06,490 --> 02:50:07,323
She helped start a to on a national park
in Madagascar and they had these huge 

3797
02:50:12,700 --> 02:50:15,370
hairy spiders in moment.
I found a national park.

3798
02:50:15,400 --> 02:50:18,400
How big you are showing me like a 
football.

3799
02:50:18,430 --> 02:50:21,730
I'm showing this like this big.
Oh my God.

3800
02:50:21,790 --> 02:50:23,860
They're big.
They're huge and bigger than a softball.

3801
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:29,080
Big trenchless like big translates big 
crabs.

3802
02:50:29,650 --> 02:50:30,700
Not Quite,
but yes,

3803
02:50:30,701 --> 02:50:33,310
we're in the right vicinity.
They're harmless though.

3804
02:50:33,430 --> 02:50:36,370
There's no docks in two minutes.
I'm gonna kill him.

3805
02:50:36,371 --> 02:50:38,120
Anyway,
she was dumped on them.

3806
02:50:39,170 --> 02:50:40,420
There was a researcher,
she was at,

3807
02:50:40,450 --> 02:50:41,283
I want to say she was at Duke at the 
time and one of the researchers there 

3808
02:50:43,871 --> 02:50:45,140
asked if she would,
you know,

3809
02:50:45,160 --> 02:50:50,160
kind of bring these spiders back for her
to do some research on and a hat,

3810
02:50:52,050 --> 02:50:55,150
kind of fill the container with it and 
it was under her seat on the airplane.

3811
02:50:55,180 --> 02:50:56,013
Oh my God.
And she's wearing a skirt and she 

3812
02:50:57,231 --> 02:50:58,064
sitting on the airplane and she suddenly
starts to feel something walking up her 

3813
02:51:02,471 --> 02:51:05,710
skirt and she's not.
She looks down.

3814
02:51:05,720 --> 02:51:06,760
She was like,
Whoa,

3815
02:51:06,761 --> 02:51:08,920
crap.
And they're all over the first class.

3816
02:51:09,130 --> 02:51:12,040
Oh my God.
It was literally spiders.

3817
02:51:13,150 --> 02:51:15,190
Spiders on the played.
Did she get arrested?

3818
02:51:15,210 --> 02:51:16,450
No,
I don't think she got arrested.

3819
02:51:16,600 --> 02:51:18,490
She got it.
She got them all back in.

3820
02:51:19,250 --> 02:51:20,990
Think it was like eight.
Oh,

3821
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:24,250
eight.
I could have the number I need to ask as

3822
02:51:24,340 --> 02:51:25,300
scientists.
Lady,

3823
02:51:25,301 --> 02:51:26,930
what are you doing?
Seriously?

3824
02:51:26,931 --> 02:51:29,260
She couldn't put those things down in 
the hub or the.

3825
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:31,653
Wow.
So she had to take them like a little 

3826
02:51:33,131 --> 02:51:34,900
poodle.
Spiders on the plane.

3827
02:51:35,530 --> 02:51:37,510
What'd you got?
Huntsman spider.

3828
02:51:37,511 --> 02:51:38,770
That was going around the Internet last 
week.

3829
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:41,380
Oh God,
it's so big.

3830
02:51:41,830 --> 02:51:43,840
How big is that?
What does that thing that it's on?

3831
02:51:43,900 --> 02:51:46,360
I need something to compare that to.
What is that thing?

3832
02:51:46,500 --> 02:51:50,860
It's those babies.
It's an Australian spot.

3833
02:51:50,890 --> 02:51:53,050
Oh boy.
There's a person you get.

3834
02:51:53,240 --> 02:51:55,810
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

3835
02:51:55,811 --> 02:51:57,280
It's a crab.
That's like one of those,

3836
02:51:57,281 --> 02:51:58,660
um,
those uh,

3837
02:51:58,750 --> 02:52:01,660
crab people.
What is the deadliest catch?

3838
02:52:01,661 --> 02:52:06,070
Like a,
the thing John Carpenter

3839
02:52:06,440 --> 02:52:10,520
thing or the thing from alien.
The face hugger for the face hugger from

3840
02:52:10,521 --> 02:52:11,680
alien.
That's what I was trying to get at.

3841
02:52:11,710 --> 02:52:13,150
But similar.
The thing is the one,

3842
02:52:13,180 --> 02:52:15,630
you know that the head had the crab 
legs,

3843
02:52:15,631 --> 02:52:19,240
he came out of a fucking a man.
Boy,

3844
02:52:20,050 --> 02:52:21,760
you know,
I've always said that about insects.

3845
02:52:21,761 --> 02:52:25,540
We're so lucky they're little because if
bees was size of horses,

3846
02:52:25,870 --> 02:52:29,730
they're just flying through the air.
Just giant bees everywhere.

3847
02:52:29,940 --> 02:52:32,710
You mentioned a colony of horse size 
bees.

3848
02:52:32,860 --> 02:52:34,960
Isn't there a movie?
We're either.

3849
02:52:34,961 --> 02:52:36,850
The insects get bigger.
We get small.

3850
02:52:37,260 --> 02:52:38,093
Probably probably like some 19 fifties.
Moving 60 zap array or something that 

3851
02:52:42,311 --> 02:52:44,640
you could follow the people's shark late
night.

3852
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:45,781
Yeah,
man,

3853
02:52:45,781 --> 02:52:46,430
they,
they're,

3854
02:52:46,430 --> 02:52:48,540
they're fucking terrifying.
We're just really lucky.

3855
02:52:48,541 --> 02:52:50,790
They're little hero,
most of them.

3856
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:51,833
Yeah.

3857
02:52:52,270 --> 02:52:54,310
Anyway,
our time's almost done.

3858
02:52:54,730 --> 02:52:57,680
So a Haiti leave with leave within 
insects,

3859
02:52:58,390 --> 02:52:59,223
spiders and bugs.
Let's close it out with something 

3860
02:53:00,641 --> 02:53:02,160
exciting.
Okay.

3861
02:53:04,180 --> 02:53:06,460
I don't know.
I don't know where we're going here.

3862
02:53:07,830 --> 02:53:10,790
What is the conclusion to your book?
This,

3863
02:53:10,800 --> 02:53:12,810
this new one?
Fire where we're going with it.

3864
02:53:14,840 --> 02:53:17,300
There's obviously tremendous 
opportunities and upset.

3865
02:53:17,330 --> 02:53:20,070
There's also some dangerous for sure.
Um,

3866
02:53:20,720 --> 02:53:22,850
commercialization militarization,
hedonism.

3867
02:53:22,851 --> 02:53:25,230
These are all dangers that come with,
you know,

3868
02:53:25,320 --> 02:53:27,860
exploring aneurysm,
overindulgence over indulgence,

3869
02:53:27,861 --> 02:53:28,694
but commercialization to.
Because the same impulses can be really 

3870
02:53:31,731 --> 02:53:33,620
harnessed to sell us stuff.
Um,

3871
02:53:34,730 --> 02:53:35,450
and

3872
02:53:35,450 --> 02:53:37,760
is there also an issue in 
commercialization in the same issue that

3873
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:38,603
has been with opiates?
Opiates have a real benefit for people 

3874
02:53:40,381 --> 02:53:41,214
that are in chronic pain,
but they've been sold so many times and 

3875
02:53:44,431 --> 02:53:45,264
they're so available and so over 
prescribed that you're dealing with is 

3876
02:53:48,301 --> 02:53:50,340
massive amount of people that have 
addictions to them.

3877
02:53:50,341 --> 02:53:50,650
Now

3878
02:53:50,650 --> 02:53:52,000
we're living.
Just put it this way,

3879
02:53:52,001 --> 02:53:54,320
I.
One of the things we tell people,

3880
02:53:54,880 --> 02:53:57,190
you know,
the flow genome project is don't ever go

3881
02:53:57,191 --> 02:53:58,024
shopping in a flow state because you've 
got massively heightened pattern 

3882
02:54:01,481 --> 02:54:02,314
recognition,
information processing and everything 

3883
02:54:04,061 --> 02:54:05,300
looks great.
It's gonna,

3884
02:54:05,410 --> 02:54:08,050
you're going to write it,
it can get very,

3885
02:54:08,051 --> 02:54:10,390
very expensive like going to the 
supermarket when you're hungry,

3886
02:54:10,420 --> 02:54:11,740
right?
Same sort of thing.

3887
02:54:11,741 --> 02:54:14,980
Everything looks great on you and you 
know,

3888
02:54:14,990 --> 02:54:17,290
because it's optimal performance,
you feel great,

3889
02:54:17,291 --> 02:54:19,750
you know,
but it's in those,

3890
02:54:19,780 --> 02:54:22,510
we can abuse those for commercial ends 
for sure.

3891
02:54:22,511 --> 02:54:25,120
And um,
and you know,

3892
02:54:26,020 --> 02:54:30,550
this is not wild speculation.
A two or three years ago,

3893
02:54:30,580 --> 02:54:34,720
the flow genome project presented the 
Advertising Research Foundation,

3894
02:54:34,721 --> 02:54:35,554
which is a collection of pretty much 
every major media and ad company in the 

3895
02:54:39,881 --> 02:54:40,714
world and they brought us in to talk 
about kind of flow and advertising and 

3896
02:54:44,861 --> 02:54:48,450
could you start to harness non ordinary 
states of consciousness as to,

3897
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:49,840
you know,
drive buying behavior.

3898
02:54:49,840 --> 02:54:51,580
And the answer is yes,
for sure.

3899
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:53,440
Um,
so they're,

3900
02:54:53,590 --> 02:54:54,250
you know,
they're,

3901
02:54:54,250 --> 02:54:57,400
this stuff requires a massive amount of 
responsibility.

3902
02:54:57,401 --> 02:55:02,401
We feel that open source in the research
and open sourcing the exploration is,

3903
02:55:03,100 --> 02:55:07,190
is the best way to kind of keep it free 
and tamp down those impulses.

3904
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:09,170
So,
but ultimately I,

3905
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:11,570
you know,
where do I think it's going is I,

3906
02:55:11,571 --> 02:55:12,404
you know,
I think most of the skills that we need 

3907
02:55:15,171 --> 02:55:17,930
in the 21st century,
whether it's kind of,

3908
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:19,460
as I said earlier,
dealing with trauma,

3909
02:55:19,461 --> 02:55:20,294
anxiety,
those kinds of things or create the 

3910
02:55:22,251 --> 02:55:25,820
heights of creativity and cooperation 
and all that stuff.

3911
02:55:26,360 --> 02:55:27,193
Those are best accessed through altered 
states of consciousness during non 

3912
02:55:30,771 --> 02:55:32,480
ordinary states of consciousness.
In a sense.

3913
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:36,980
These are the tools evolution gave us 
for ultimate performance and I think,

3914
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:38,390
you know,
whether it's,

3915
02:55:38,720 --> 02:55:40,490
you know,
sometimes for a long time we didn't have

3916
02:55:40,491 --> 02:55:42,500
the science to understand what was all 
going on with.

3917
02:55:42,500 --> 02:55:45,530
There's a whole bunch of kind of moral 
issues that got layered on top of it.

3918
02:55:45,800 --> 02:55:48,860
I think some of the moral issues are 
getting kind of peeled back in.

3919
02:55:48,861 --> 02:55:49,694
The science is showing up.
So I think we're gonna see a huge kind 

3920
02:55:52,900 --> 02:55:55,760
of revolution in this stuff.
And you look at the numbers,

3921
02:55:55,761 --> 02:55:57,980
just,
just talking about flow,

3922
02:55:58,310 --> 02:55:59,360
um,
depending on,

3923
02:56:00,260 --> 02:56:02,360
we talked about this crazy boost and 
learning,

3924
02:56:02,361 --> 02:56:03,194
you know,
that that Darpa and advanced brain 

3925
02:56:04,521 --> 02:56:05,354
monitoring achieved with it with the 
military 400 to $400 or 230 to 500 

3926
02:56:10,911 --> 02:56:13,160
percent increase in accelerated 
learning.

3927
02:56:13,460 --> 02:56:17,060
You see a similar spike in motivation.
You see a similar spike in creativity.

3928
02:56:17,380 --> 02:56:19,460
Um,
this,

3929
02:56:19,490 --> 02:56:21,710
these are huge step functions 
difference,

3930
02:56:21,711 --> 02:56:22,544
right?
If you're in self help and I can get a 

3931
02:56:24,081 --> 02:56:27,500
five percent improvement over like six 
months and it'll stick.

3932
02:56:27,740 --> 02:56:29,180
Oh my God,
it's a miracle.

3933
02:56:29,181 --> 02:56:30,040
It's giant,
right?

3934
02:56:30,050 --> 02:56:31,820
It's giant.
And you're talking about,

3935
02:56:32,030 --> 02:56:34,490
you know,
creativity spiking 400 percent.

3936
02:56:34,491 --> 02:56:35,324
And it's not even just in the moment.
Teresa Amabile at Harvard discovered 

3937
02:56:38,061 --> 02:56:41,510
that the heightened creativity that 
shows up in a flow state can outlast the

3938
02:56:41,511 --> 02:56:43,130
flow state by a day,
sometimes two days,

3939
02:56:43,131 --> 02:56:45,140
and it suggests more research needs to 
be done.

3940
02:56:45,410 --> 02:56:46,243
But it suggests that flow actually 
rewires the brain to think more 

3941
02:56:48,831 --> 02:56:49,664
creatively overtime,
which is amazing because it's really 

3942
02:56:51,951 --> 02:56:52,784
hard to train people up in creativity.
But we're not talking about a five 

3943
02:56:55,131 --> 02:56:55,964
percent increase,
you're talking about a to a step 

3944
02:56:57,921 --> 02:56:58,754
function worth a difference and we're 
just starting to kind of tap it into 

3945
02:57:01,251 --> 02:57:02,330
this function,
you know,

3946
02:57:02,331 --> 02:57:03,164
and I'm sure you've had similar 
conversations with the people in the 

3947
02:57:05,481 --> 02:57:06,314
high performance world about this,
but anybody you talk to has done much 

3948
02:57:09,741 --> 02:57:12,040
work on high performance,
will tell you we think we've,

3949
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:12,913
you know,
tap five percent of what we know and 

3950
02:57:14,721 --> 02:57:15,800
what's actually possible.

3951
02:57:15,800 --> 02:57:16,461
So,
you know,

3952
02:57:16,461 --> 02:57:17,294
I think what's coming is going to be 
incredibly exciting and incredibly 

3953
02:57:19,641 --> 02:57:20,670
interesting.
How's that?

3954
02:57:20,960 --> 02:57:23,510
How's that for a final test where you 
fucking nailed it,

3955
02:57:23,511 --> 02:57:24,980
dude.
Just knocked it out of the park.

3956
02:57:25,730 --> 02:57:27,880
Thank you so much for coming on here.

3961
02:57:40,670 --> 02:57:44,870
I'm Steven Underscore Kotler on twitter 
and I'm really responsive on twitter.

3962
02:57:44,871 --> 02:57:46,970
So if you want to follow me,
want to ask me questions,

3963
02:57:46,971 --> 02:57:50,000
whatever are flow,
genome project.com.

3964
02:57:50,001 --> 02:57:53,840
One resource I want to give people is if
you go to the flow genome project,

3965
02:57:54,160 --> 02:57:54,993
a.com,
there's a free flow profile of the 

3966
02:57:56,611 --> 02:58:01,070
anybody can take and it basically says 
if your trait tology says if you're this

3967
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:01,913
kind of person,
you're likely to find flow in the 

3968
02:58:04,241 --> 02:58:04,690
instruction.

3969
02:58:04,690 --> 02:58:07,500
So you asked what's the easiest entrance
place for people?

3970
02:58:07,830 --> 02:58:10,470
The flow profiles are really easy 
entrance place.

3971
02:58:10,471 --> 02:58:15,270
It'll tell you what direction to go.
And and it's actually interesting point.

3972
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:18,110
It's become one of the largest studies 
that anybody's ever run.

3973
02:58:18,111 --> 02:58:19,950
An optimal psych.
It sort of happened accidentally.

3974
02:58:19,951 --> 02:58:20,784
We didn't expect to,
but like 40 some thousand people have 

3975
02:58:22,741 --> 02:58:25,560
taken this thing.
And the weird fact that I will leave you

3976
02:58:25,561 --> 02:58:28,830
with is even though we normally 
associate flow with athletic achievement

3977
02:58:28,831 --> 02:58:31,680
or artistic achievement,
the vast majority of our respondents,

3978
02:58:31,681 --> 02:58:34,980
I think it's 47 percent of our study 
group find the most flow.

3979
02:58:34,981 --> 02:58:36,870
They fall into what we call the deep 
thinker category.

3980
02:58:36,890 --> 02:58:39,360
Essentially they're knowledge workers,
they're finding flow,

3981
02:58:39,361 --> 02:58:40,194
doing contemplate of creative tasks,
so even though we associate this with 

3982
02:58:43,231 --> 02:58:44,064
artistic athletic performance,
it seems like most people get the post 

3983
02:58:46,481 --> 02:58:49,380
flow in their lives really just working 
and things like that,

3984
02:58:49,530 --> 02:58:51,060
which is interesting.
That is awesome.

3985
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:52,860
And your book is out in February,
February.

3986

3987

3992

trump's supporter.

3995
02:59:14,550 --> 02:59:15,383
Whoa.
