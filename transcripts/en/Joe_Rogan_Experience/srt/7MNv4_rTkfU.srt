1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,690
Three,
two,

2
00:00:03,691 --> 00:00:06,090
one,
boom.

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:10,200
And we're live with happened in Joe.
What's up Mike Thompson girls in the

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:14,430
house for man minutes here by to say hi.
I can't believe you've never had a cup

5
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,390
of coffee.
Never.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,910
Do you want some know that that might
be.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,840
That might be the most outrageous thing
about you is that you've never had

8
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:23,910
coffee your whole life.
Ever had coffee.

9
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:27,060
Now did you just tea,
never coffee.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,120
No one ever offered you a cup of coffee.
He never went to starbucks?

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,070
No.
Fatigue with and donut.

12
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,990
Wow.
What about like when I was in Rehab,

13
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,480
you always got to go to starbucks
because the meetings right outside of

14
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,310
starbucks,
he always hang out at starbucks.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,430
Right,
but never for coffee.

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,290
You didn't want to try it?
Never.

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,150
Hmm.
That is that.

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,920
How about like,
like girlfriends wives?

19
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:51,960
Like none of them ever drank coffee at
home.

20
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,670
I'm sure they have.
I never really,

21
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,370
my wife drinks it and you'd just
nothing.

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,121
No,
nothing.

23
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:57,780
No.
No.

24
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,070
Well,
I'm so addicted to drugs that,

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,560
did you think coffee?
It'd be nothing.

26
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,930
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah,

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,510
that's what I'm saying.
Like it doesn't make any sense.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,810
When,
when did you first try any drugs?

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,120
Um,
kid and your kids?

30
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,290
What kind of Shit?
Smoking and drinking.

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,820
Right.
Then as I got older I tried to ask it.

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,820
How old were you when he first tried to
ask her?

33
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,580
11.
Wow.

34
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,020
Really Young.
Jesus man.

35
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,340
Wow,
that's really young.

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,600
Wow.
But when you were the champ,

37
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,000
when you were in your prime,
like when you,

38
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:36,150
when like when you beat Trevor Berbick
when you doing anything back then was

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,770
drinking a lot.
Drinking a lot.

40
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,700
Really?
Yeah.

41
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,360
That's amazing.
Well you go clean for camp or like if a

42
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:46,320
camp just for camp,
the camp outside once fights over and

43
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,030
say,
yeah,

44
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,850
you were the first guy that I ever used
as an example of a to break that old

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,820
myth that you can't have sex before
fights.

46
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,490
And I was like,
well that's out the window for sure.

47
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,260
Cause you,
you would talk about it all the time.

48
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:02,160
He'd be like,
yeah,

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,960
yeah,
I'm pretty much yet

50
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,240
your logic made sense to you?
Like I don't want to think about it.

51
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,670
I don't want to be thinking about sex.
I'll just get it out of the way.

52
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,970
Yeah.
And there's over what do,

53
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:16,800
you don't have to do it.
You have fuel for the next six weeks and

54
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:19,830
it's going to fight.
Do you think that was a myth that it

55
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,180
made you weak?
Yeah,

56
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,890
I think it's a myth.
Yeah.

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,110
It doesn't seem to make sense.
It seems odd.

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,350
Yeah.
And then whenever the spy you more so

59
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:32,340
than the synagogue too,
I would think they said that the

60
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:33,200
Olympic,
uh,

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,810
you know where the athletes stay,
it's just like fuck fest.

62
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,430
Oh yeah.
They had the boy and the girl if the

63
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,230
thing facility,
yeah.

64
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,730
We also probably want to leave.
You ate some anxiety,

65
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,260
anxiety,
freaking out.

66
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,640
You're at the Olympics,
you know,

67
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:51,000
you're 18 years old and everyone's in
amazing shape.

68
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,310
Dresses out.
Stressed out.

69
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,680
Yeah.
When you were,

70
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,080
when you were first coming up and when
you were first,

71
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,310
uh,
we,

72
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,020
you like when you were

73
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,020
a kid,
dynamite on sports illustrated.

74
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll never forget that man.
That was a,

75
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,390
that your era from like,
you know,

76
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,190
the 80s,
the late eighties,

77
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,450
that error,
like it was a big part of my youth.

78
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,643
You know,
like,

79
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,800
yeah man,
you being the chant.

80
00:03:16,801 --> 00:03:21,070
It was like,
it was a change of things because when

81
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,920
Larry Holmes was the champ,
as a boxing fan,

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,140
I loved Larry Holmes.
Like there's that cover.

83
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,750
You were 19 years old,
right?

84
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,070
It's nuts.
When Larry Holmes was the champ as a

85
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,500
boxing fan,
why you still got that stuff,

86
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:35,590
man.
You can still get those sports

87
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,700
illustrated.
It's the Internet.

88
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,650
You can find it on the Internet.
That's how Jamie got it.

89
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,640
Um,
I had that sports illustrated,

90
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,980
but when Larry Holmes was a,
a champ,

91
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,440
as a boxing fan,
I appreciated him.

92
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,010
I knew he was a great fighter.
I,

93
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,601
I,
you know,

94
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,840
we would get together with friends and
watch like the,

95
00:03:51,841 --> 00:03:54,490
the,
the Michael spinks fight with Larry

96
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,410
Holmes.
When spinks beat him for the title.

97
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,020
It was a big deal,
but it wasn't a big deal.

98
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,110
Culturally.
Yeah.

99
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,700
People didn't care as much.
But then you came around and when you

100
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,550
came around,
all this sudden everybody's watching

101
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,550
heavyweight boxing.
Heavyweight boxing wasn't,

102
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,060
it wasn't boring again.
It was the,

103
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,080
the most crazy exciting thing in sports.
When your fights would go on,

104
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,800
it would be about,
should I pay for this cause how long is

105
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,630
this going to last?
Like dad never.

106
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,300
We had people telling me about that

107
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,340
come,
they all chipped in and took a fight on

108
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,490
the phone.
I know.

109
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,650
Think about it like that,
you know,

110
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,723
sometimes

111
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,203
when it comes from out

112
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,320
realization of the situation,
I forget that I'm that guy.

113
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:37,810
I forget that train that hard and I
became a fighter and stuff.

114
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,380
Yeah,
that's what I was going to ask you.

115
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,200
Like d does it seem like a dream?

116
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,930
Yeah,
pretty much like a blur

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,050
because I,
I couldn't imagine what it would be like

118
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:52,980
to be 19 years old,
20 years old at that fucking famous.

119
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,160
It was a trip.
Who,

120
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,600
who can handle that is then,
can anybody handle that?

121
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,521
No.
It was a trip,

122
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,380
but it was just what to mind,
you know,

123
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,640
that was his blueprints and make me
teenage superstar.

124
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,870
Did he give you advice on how to handle
pressure and fame and

125
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,880
Oh,
depression,

126
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:09,714
everything,
but you know.

127
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,983
MMM.

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,090
It,
there's really no um,

129
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,990
ingredients.
We'll have a handle thing,

130
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,160
you know what I mean?
Um,

131
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,700
we have to see what,
what I'm department of fame is your

132
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,040
problem and we have to work on that
issue from there.

133
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,910
But no ones knows how to conduct
themselves under that kind of pressure.

134
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,253
No,

135
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,590
the level of fame too,
it's like there's so many,

136
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:37,591
you realize there's so many levels of
fame and then Mike's is still just

137
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,060
extraordinary where like people,
people walk away from their job,

138
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,700
like an airport.
They're supposed to be at the cash

139
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:50,670
register and they run out,
you know,

140
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,530
they leave their job to go say hi,
that's not,

141
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,970
you know,
most of the time I'd be like,

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,170
oh,
that's who that person is.

143
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,530
It's a totally thing.

144
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,953
Or where does that

145
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,280
pretty weird
confidently get used to this device to

146
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:05,690
be willing to like get the fuck away
from me,

147
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,080
man,
when you're doing creep,

148
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,230
I never knew how to conduct myself.
I might come in and take a picture,

149
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,160
take a picture of my kid,
take a picture here,

150
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,580
take a picture of it.
I love this and that.

151
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,600
And I'm like,
Whoa,

152
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:16,640
dude,
cool out.

153
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,300
You know what I mean?
But now,

154
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:20,250
you know,
I understand this is just what it is.

155
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:22,350
It is what it is and you're not going to
be able to stop it.

156
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,520
Yeah.
I've seen you at the UFC before.

157
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,160
You're very calm around people on people
grabbing at,

158
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:28,340
you want to take pictures.
He just,

159
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,610
just relax.
You got to see is awesome cause

160
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:34,340
everybody's nuts.
Yeah.

161
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,800
That's a,
it's a,

162
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:39,100
it's definitely a wild environment.
What do you think of beeps going to do

163
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:41,320
now?
But I think who could be,

164
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,050
um,
while he does whatever the fuck he wants

165
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:44,980
to do,
that's where I think,

166
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,980
I think that goes probably the best
lightweight of all time.

167
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,290
He's a monster credible.
He,

168
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,330
um,
I think he's probably gonna have some

169
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:56,740
fights at 170 pounds eventually,
if I'd imagine at 155.

170
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,820
There's,
you know,

171
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:00,490
there's good fights for him.
Tony Ferguson's a great fight for him.

172
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,270
Um,
uh,

173
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,920
really interested in seeing that.
Uh,

174
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:06,490
I'm really interested in seeing him
going up a really interesting to see him

175
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,980
fight at 170 pounds from the fight.

176
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,230
Well,
first of all,

177
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,410
tyron Woodley,
who was the champ at 170 that that would

178
00:07:14,411 --> 00:07:16,210
be an insane fight.
George St Pierre.

179
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:18,280
If he decided to come back and make a
big super fight,

180
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:21,760
that would be an insane fight.
I think 170 has a lot of opportunities

181
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,980
for them,
but I think 155 does too.

182
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,660
They just have to figure out who's going
to fight him.

183
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,810
He's an international superstar now.
You know,

184
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:30,790
could be,
especially the way he smashed connor

185
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:33,910
connor.
Such a superstar ready that the way it

186
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,450
could be one and did it so dominant.
I think he's,

187
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,700
I think he's through the roof now.
I think when people,

188
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,880
when he comes back and people see the
paper view numbers of his fights are

189
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:46,720
going to realize how huge this guy is
because he's so interesting.

190
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,330
He's very humble,
very,

191
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,430
very.
He's very polite,

192
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,220
very well spoken and very religious guy.

193
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,950
Lives with his family,
lives with his parents,

194
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,570
lives with his parents,
his family,

195
00:07:58,571 --> 00:08:00,490
I believe.
I hope I'm not speaking out of school.

196
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,340
I believe that's true.
And obviously it doesn't have to for

197
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:06,730
money and he's rich as shit now,
but he's just a monster.

198
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:08,650
The best,
best grappler I've ever seen inside the

199
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:11,020
155 pound division.
He just smashes people.

200
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,510
He's thinking about Jon Jones.
What?

201
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,970
W in what way?
And it was still his skill.

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,740
He's phenomenal.
Incredible.

203
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:21,280
The best ever it using distance.
He knows distance better than anybody.

204
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:25,120
He's a master at knowing when he can hit
you and you can't hit him with watching

205
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,110
them fight.
You know what I mean?

206
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,030
He's been fighting as much anymore.
He's back.

207
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,650
He just one,
just one the title again,

208
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,930
just fun.
Alexander Gustafson.

209
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,260
Yeah.
A couple of weeks ago.

210
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,520
Yeah.
For Bacon Peyto it was Daniel Cormier,

211
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:39,520
Aka relinquish his title and it was
like,

212
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,530
it's weird,
right?

213
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,760
Like call me a is the champ because Jon
Jones tested positive for something.

214
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:48,430
So they stripped him and then call me a,
became the champ.

215
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,953
It's,
uh,

216
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,420
you know,
I think they'll probably fight again

217
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,280
whether they fight again and heavyweight
or light heavy.

218
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:54,971
Really?
Yeah.

219
00:08:54,971 --> 00:08:56,120
I core main Jon Jones

220
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,990
and Cormier,
he wants to keep going,

221
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,820
but he says he wants to retire soon.
He's 40,

222
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,900
you know?
Yeah.

223
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,690
It feel looks good.
He looks great.

224
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,940
Especially at heavyweight and
heavyweight.

225
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,620
He's,
he doesn't have to cut weight.

226
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,680
He's got so much strength and s two so
agile,

227
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,520
he's such a unbelievable wrestler too.
I mean his wrestling skill,

228
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,920
his skill level and understanding of
wrestling so high,

229
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,460
so above most p anybody find out finally
doing John Jones?

230
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,700
He dominated.
Yeah.

231
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,820
Yeah.
That's how good John Is.

232
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,020
John's dad.
Good.

233
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,220
He's that.
I mean,

234
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,010
it just sucks that he's had so many
controversies in his life,

235
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:31,650
but I'm hoping he puts all that shit
behind him.

236
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,090
Have you ever spoken with him about
that?

237
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,330
Never been his personal life and live
when we met before and talk.

238
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,100
But you're a guy who's gone.
I mean,

239
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:41,010
when you went through legal problems
yourself,

240
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,240
you,
you overcame,

241
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:42,930
you came out of it.

242
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,420
On the other hand,
I think would think a guy like him could

243
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:49,590
benefit a lot from,
but it's just so difficult and you're

244
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,750
throwing fucking,
did they have to go through something

245
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:52,770
like that,
you know?

246
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,270
Do you think so?
Yeah.

247
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,600
[inaudible] you know,
cause sometimes people,

248
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,360
um,
they will survive situations like that

249
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,540
because they're so wild and they're
having a good time too much in the party

250
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,150
and the champ,
it has to have to come to an end.

251
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,620
That stuff,
if you don't bring it to the next club,

252
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,510
bring it could come to his own and it
might not like that way then.

253
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,760
Yeah.
So you think for a guy like him,

254
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:18,720
maybe getting in trouble was a good
thing if only if you learn from

255
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,880
experiences like that.
You know,

256
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,570
I think I was just a wild guy.
I was really a wild guy.

257
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,810
I look at myself now and I feel myself
when I spent those trips and those psych

258
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:31,830
wards and thought that,
what was that all about?

259
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,150
What,
what's wrong with me back then,

260
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,100
you know?
Yeah.

261
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,350
And I must say I was really disturbed
back then.

262
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,660
But you're somebody who got to the point
where you got like,

263
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,930
it's really fascinating because I know
you're not,

264
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,040
you're a public figure.
So I,

265
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,380
you know,
I've been able to watch you my whole

266
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,750
life.
You went through all that stuff and then

267
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:53,530
you got to this point where you are very
self reflective and you look at,

268
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,200
you are able to comment on it.
I don't think most,

269
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,080
I mean most people regardless of whether
they're famous or not,

270
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,210
just still don't get to that point where
they're able to look back and examine

271
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,590
who they were and doing wild shit and
with ruth

272
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,840
honesty.
Yeah.

273
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,560
That's what's so great reflecting itself
to discover who you really are.

274
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,620
Yeah.
When you're 20 years old and all of a

275
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:18,020
sudden you're the heavyweight champion
of the world and just a few years ago

276
00:11:18,021 --> 00:11:21,170
you were poor and now all of a sudden
you're the king of the world.

277
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,220
That's really crazy.
You're not so really crave that.

278
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,990
I was,
I was unable to handle it.

279
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,630
I wasn't expecting that.
That was a really sucker punch right

280
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:32,180
there and the real sucker punch.
Right?

281
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,920
Yeah.
I wasn't ready for that one.

282
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,320
Charlie Murphy told us a story and it's
animated.

283
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:40,670
It's on youtube now of you and him
coming over your house in a limousine

284
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,560
and you had a,
it was a lion or a tiger.

285
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,290
Tiger.
He must though the line for it the way.

286
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,220
Yeah,
the tiger.

287
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,700
It is one of the craziest fucking
stories.

288
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,010
I always win.
So for people that don't know,

289
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:55,960
I got to hang out with you at one of my
shows one time and it was a great,

290
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:57,700
I had the best time talking about
everything.

291
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,490
What made you think you could get a
tiger?

292
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,050
Like how did that even happen?

293
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,890
Hey,
I'm in.

294
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,590
Um,
and so,

295
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,780
um,
I'm in prison at the time,

296
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,410
so I'm in prison.
I'm talking to my car dealer at the time

297
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:16,010
and he has this,
he has some caused the belonged to a

298
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:19,120
friend of mine that's supposed to friend
of ours and he's discussing the fee

299
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:22,610
doesn't pay for these cars.
I'm to sell these cars to somebody and

300
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:23,930
get some horses and stuff.
I said,

301
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:26,660
well he can get a horses.
Horses are for card.

302
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,090
Cause I had a lot of cards.
I said I probably get some horses.

303
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,480
Yeah man,
you get,

304
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,200
you get cool goods.
Lions,

305
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:34,210
tigers.
I love this guy.

306
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,530
Got exactly what I see you do.
Can you get me some tigers?

307
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,750
Yeah.
And the guy told me and the guy from,

308
00:12:38,751 --> 00:12:42,020
imagine how cool that would be be cause
I had a bunch of fans because magnetic

309
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,940
man,
he'd be in the afternoon or for Rami.

310
00:12:43,941 --> 00:12:45,560
You have a tiger right next to you,
man.

311
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,300
And
I'm saying to myself why that would be

312
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:52,460
cool.
Right after he had gave me some cousin

313
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,890
and then I came home,
I had those cubs.

314
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:55,090
Right.

315
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,500
They're waiting for me.
So you raised them as cubs?

316
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,140
Yeah,
because that's,

317
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,560
that's how you work.
Because I would see footage of you like

318
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:03,770
fucking smacking them around and jumping
on one of your tires.

319
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:05,510
And I was like,
Holy Shit.

320
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:07,790
And I had my third baby and their
mother,

321
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,180
the mother babies.
Now she never gets,

322
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,570
this is a crazy picture.
You and your underwear with a tiger on a

323
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:16,760
chain that is,
that is one of the,

324
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,240
that's that's you at peak.
Crazy.

325
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,830
Yeah,
and thing.

326
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:22,710
Yeah.

327
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,720
What was going through my mind.
Yeah.

328
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,980
No,
it made me think about my friends and

329
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,550
Mike.
You can get from our from animal.

330
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,260
Nothing really are serious.
I'm going to give him a whole effort.

331
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,220
Everybody does it though.

332
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,640
So one of the things about,
uh,

333
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,070
with,
what's his face from narcos?

334
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,010
Pablo Escobar,
he got like a fucking zoo.

335
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,070
I had a whole crazy zoo.
They all do it.

336
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,810
Once you get like that rich,
you're like,

337
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:50,100
just get some animals,
some animals

338
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,240
and they throw people in there with the
Lions and tigers.

339
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,250
Real common thing that is super rich
people.

340
00:14:00,251 --> 00:14:03,870
They start getting lunch and shit.
Jacqueline had all that stuff.

341
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,860
That's right.
Michael Jackson.

342
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,240
Michael Jackson.
Yeah.

343
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,010
They had like a zoo in his backyard.
He had weird shit.

344
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:13,770
Like weird birds.
Yeah.

345
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,820
I don't think it may be at a monkey or
something.

346
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,810
He did have weird shit.
Nothing dangerous day before the playboy

347
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,510
mansion.
This is at the end of his career.

348
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:24,810
That was like whoa.
The thing years ago or something.

349
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,620
It was pretty awesome.
Yeah.

350
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:27,371
That guy,
man.

351
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:28,360
What a life.
He loved.

352
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:33,130
He'll
pajamas balls.

353
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:34,640
When you say 80 and shit,
they're like,

354
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,620
oh no.

355
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,260
Eighties deep into his eighties nineties
yeah.

356
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,950
He really,
here's the thing that dude lived the

357
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,350
lifestyle he was talking about.
You know a lot of people talk shit.

358
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,460
Yeah,
you don't really do that.

359
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,950
He was really doing it,
I thought would be dark or fucking dog.

360
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,080
You you blue wall.
That's just too much.

361
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,880
Yeah.
Much one other thing.

362
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,790
I got it cause I got to run and I wanted
that I hadn't had gone man,

363
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,620
I gotta go,
I gotta go meet the wife Man.

364
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,750
I do it.
They'll do it.

365
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,410
I read one time cause oh wait.
So for people that know I,

366
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,580
I met Mike on a flight and it was a
surreal experience,

367
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,540
you know,
like from,

368
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,530
from being a kid and thinking like this
is superman.

369
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,330
That's what I thought I was a kid.
It's just,

370
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,070
you know what I mean?
Like seeing those when you see it as a

371
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:20,300
kid too,
I think it's different.

372
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,680
Like you're just like,
whoa,

373
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:24,840
that is so nuts.
Like these 11 second knock out

374
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,710
periodically.
Even to this day,

375
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:30,290
people come up to me and talk about the
experience that they feel,

376
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:32,300
how many talked about meeting me and
through that true

377
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,020
all it takes honestly,
mostly stories that true.

378
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,280
Yeah,
mostly stories.

379
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:43,250
And it was a,
it was a surreal experience.

380
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:43,911
And,
and you know,

381
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:47,510
we spoke on the plane and then like when
I thought we were done talking,

382
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,330
you know,
I face forward and then he came back and

383
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:51,680
like tapped me on the shoulder.
I was like,

384
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:54,200
Oh shit.
Like Mike's talking to me,

385
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:56,480
I'm down here like the seatbelt,
seatbelt it in.

386
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:58,850
But then we land and he was like,
Oh,

387
00:15:58,851 --> 00:15:59,800
where's your show?
And,

388
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:00,770
and,
and I go,

389
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:01,431
oh,
it's here.

390
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,220
I gave him the number,
never expect to hear,

391
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
hits me up the next day.

392
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,250
And he's like,
we're coming to your show.

393
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,550
And I was like,
oh my God.

394
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,690
And I really did say like,
I'm amazed that you're coming.

395
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,340
And he said,
it's all love.

396
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,430
And I just said,
I love you because I didn't know how to

397
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,470
what to say.
And then that was good.

398
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,313
He was like,
cool.

399
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,371
He's like,
all right,

400
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,204
man.
And

401
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,710
I,
I remember I called the,

402
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:30,440
uh,
the Pittsburgh improv manager and I go,

403
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,490
hey man,
I just go,

404
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,280
you're not gonna believe this,
but Tyson is coming to the fight

405
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:34,911
tonight.
And he goes,

406
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,870
Mike Tyson,
I go,

407
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,490
no fucking Tyson chicken.
Yeah,

408
00:16:37,491 --> 00:16:38,840
Mike Tyson is coming tonight.
He was like,

409
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:41,690
I'll corridor off a whole thing.
And you know,

410
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,830
and I didn't know he was at the show
because the show had already started and

411
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:49,550
I didn't see him arrive.
When we go back to the green after the

412
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:53,180
show,
I walk offstage and he grabs me and he

413
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,350
goes,
let's go to the green room.

414
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,630
So he took me to my green room,
right?

415
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,070
Like he would like,
and I was like,

416
00:16:58,071 --> 00:16:58,904
fuck.
Yeah.

417
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,860
And we hung out in that green room over
an hour and just shooting the shit and

418
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,630
talking.
And when I forgot,

419
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,970
like if at the time had passed,
I opened the door,

420
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,650
the entire staff,
entire staff is lined up at the door to

421
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,320
meet him.
Like that's the effect that he has on

422
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:16,130
the group.
You know,

423
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,140
like they're waiting in a line for an
hour outside of the green room and like,

424
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,310
you know,
we talked about boxing about life.

425
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,630
It was,
it was fascinating.

426
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,390
One of the things I really appreciated
about you as a fighter was like,

427
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:32,570
that you really knew that you were
putting on a show.

428
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,310
So that,
that's something that I feel like I

429
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:35,660
miss.
You know,

430
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,400
there's,
there's no one that put on the show the

431
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,290
way you did.
Like you knew that people bought tickets

432
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,800
and paid for the paper view.
Um,

433
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,890
and then it,
you know,

434
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,420
it's still like one of my great
memories,

435
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,770
man.
It was a thrill to meet you.

436
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,150
Um,
so I just wanted to stop by and say hi

437
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:48,984
and I was like,
you're wrapping up,

438
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,130
ramping it up.

439
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,120
Yeah.
He has to go.

440
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,681
Oh,
by the way,

441
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:55,350
did you buy seven Bentley's that were
the same color?

442
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,050
No,
but I bought it around seven Bentley's

443
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:01,240
before damn near Rolls Royces.
I wanted to ask you,

444
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:03,060
you did give away one when you crashed
it,

445
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:05,190
right.
Gotten,

446
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,640
um,
I was married at the time,

447
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:10,620
the robin givens,
and we were in,

448
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,370
um,
fast food,

449
00:18:12,371 --> 00:18:13,680
January,
order the food,

450
00:18:13,681 --> 00:18:18,000
and she went in my pocket,
I guess to get some money out my pocket

451
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:20,050
to pay for it.
And she's had some fun.

452
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,200
Condoms came out and she was mad.
So she got in the car and then boom,

453
00:18:25,711 --> 00:18:30,711
she crashed the car into another car
that was just parked here.

454
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:33,660
Boom.
And she hit somebody and she hurt their

455
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:34,860
arm.
And then,

456
00:18:34,861 --> 00:18:37,760
um,
the cops came and so the cops came into

457
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,790
capsule or saying,
Hey,

458
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,380
what happened here?
Right.

459
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:40,771
And,
um,

460
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:43,170
I was afraid of they were arrest me or,
and so I said,

461
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,640
well,
nothing happened,

462
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:45,140
officer.

463
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,680
Um,
nothing.

464
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,320
He said the guy was,
and it was the guy with a broken on my

465
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:49,831
thing,
you know,

466
00:18:49,831 --> 00:18:51,720
so why don't you just take the car,
you know,

467
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:53,500
you deserve it because you've been
through doing a lot.

468
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,860
Cause I didn't want to get rent,
I didn't have rights as anything and I

469
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:58,680
didn't want my wife to get in trouble.
If you want to just take it,

470
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:01,380
you know,
it wasn't that it was around 230 at the

471
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,880
time,
so why don't you just take it?

472
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,110
It'd be okay.
And the guy said,

473
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:04,980
hey,
don't tell me that.

474
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,780
And then once he said that,
I said got him,

475
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,500
I got him.
Nothing man taking me through this man,

476
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,640
you deserve this.
Take it.

477
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,040
And they took it out.
But before that,

478
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:17,640
the guy from guy arm was broken and he,
I gave him my money as her take the

479
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:19,280
money and then he came back to the
police,

480
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,920
my army.

481
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,190
But it kept him.
Now he can get away from,

482
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,340
I'm not going to tell you to get away
from me no more because he didn't want

483
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:25,290
to mess this dealer with this car.
Cause the guy,

484
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:28,770
he's not going to get this car.
That's a little coffee.

485
00:19:28,771 --> 00:19:32,010
Don't fucking come near me again.
That hit me.

486
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,310
Larry Guy,
he's backed off and I go,

487
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:35,220
hey man,
I feel it.

488
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,500
And I took off my work.
I didn't want us to get in trouble,

489
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,910
but they made him give away the car.
Right.

490
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,520
They made it real.
He could cause I went back to my office.

491
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,950
I said,
give me my fucking car back.

492
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,784
Going to that.

493
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,210
Yeah,
he got fired.

494
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,310
He probably hearing his name.
I'm going to get that back to the title.

495
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,080
I wanted my Indian giver one of my car.

496
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,170
Oh No.
Oh Man.

497
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,090

498
00:20:05,091 --> 00:20:05,700

499
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,030
Shit.

so I had to get rid of or you know what

522
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:09,010

532
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,660
Yeah.
You,

533
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,830
you seem to be really enjoying this when
you're talking to your partners out

534
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:33,461
there.
You're,

535
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:35,440
you're having a good time with this.
Oh Man.

536
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:39,520
I never thought in a million years I'd
be able to do this and legalize.

537
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah.
When did you start like regularly

538
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,510
smoking weed?
Um,

539
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,760
since I was like 10 years old the whole
time we were fighting,

540
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:46,900
you were regular smoking weed.
Well,

541
00:21:46,901 --> 00:21:47,740
you know,
when you're a kid,

542
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,730
your mother gives you liquor and
marijuana for him.

543
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,850
He could think that you're going to go
to sleep or something.

544
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:52,750
Yeah.
Really?

545
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,760
Yeah.
That never happened in my house.

546
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,640
Never be.
Yeah,

547
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,620
I ain't no mother was alcoholic.
That's,

548
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,750
that's harsh liquor and marijuana.
See if you go to sleep.

549
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,300
Yeah.
It didn't work.

550
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,740
I don't think so.

551
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,710
Do you,
uh,

552
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:09,760
what,
what,

553
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,430
what benefits you get out of marijuana?
Like what does it do for you?

554
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,610
Hey Man.
Um,

555
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,020
if I didn't have a bad day,
yeah.

556
00:22:17,021 --> 00:22:18,580
I'm really Moody Guy Without it

557
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,910
and it just smooths me out.
So they'll take,

558
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,340
I'm a whole different person.
I'm really on top of my game.

559
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:26,960
I'm boiling.
Yeah.

560
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:29,060
I feel the same way sometimes it makes
me nicer.

561
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

562
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,540
Calms me down.
Do you,

563
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:36,020
um,
do you kind of like who I am when I

564
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:36,970
smoke?
You know what I mean?

565
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:38,090
When I'm,
when I weed,

566
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,040
I don't sometime like who I am
sometimes.

567
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,790
That's just the real something.
Yeah.

568
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,790
I don't like that guy.
Want to get away from that guy.

569
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:44,691
Well,
you know,

570
00:22:44,691 --> 00:22:48,290
I was talking to Michael Irvin once,
he was explaining it to me that when

571
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:52,460
children grow up in high stress
environments that their genes are wired

572
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,530
to,
to have a propensity towards violence,

573
00:22:54,531 --> 00:22:56,300
that if they're normal,
if it's normal,

574
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:57,960
if it's around them all the time when
they're,

575
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,750
when they're growing up and when they're
in the womb.

576
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,740
Yeah,
I agree.

577
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,740
When their mothers under extreme stress,
if they live in a bad neighborhood and

578
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,850
it's,
it's hard for some people like yourself

579
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,080
that did grow up in an environment like
that to ever reached where you're at

580
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,820
right now.
Just a place of peace.

581
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,120
And if you can do that through marijuana
or whatever it is,

582
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,260
Yoga,
meditation,

583
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,090
whatever,
whatever you do to get there,

584
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,310
like we should be happy that you could
get there.

585
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:24,940
That's what we want.
I am so grateful that um,

586
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,750
I embarked on this,
you know,

587
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:30,110
I've never been a person to this,
its magnitude at this kind of

588
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,870
relaxation.
Are you enjoying my time with you?

589
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,720
I was very uptight.
It and anytime I was with very

590
00:23:35,721 --> 00:23:38,600
uncomfortable with myself.
Did you feel any better after you worked

591
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:41,230
out when you were young like that?
Absolutely.

592
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,370
But my workout,
you know what,

593
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:47,420
I'm the best thing ever happened to me
that we tied from Barclays because of me

594
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,490
working out and meagan that was so
intense with it.

595
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,830
My whole,
my whole objective was hurting people

596
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,800
and one beat a Beth and my ego took over
and I'm like,

597
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,630
Tyson,
I'm the best to ever live and all this

598
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,360
bullshit.
And um,

599
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,870
dealing with my partner,
Rob Hickman,

600
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,120
I happened to embark on this,
um,

601
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,430
come across this thing called the toad
and he,

602
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,130
you familiar with the toe?
Yeah.

603
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:13,460
Well you're talking about it's five
methoxy dominance that fit right there.

604
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,590
Yeah.
And I came across that and I smoked

605
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:18,424
this,
um,

606
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,430
I don't know this medicine,
drug,

607
00:24:21,431 --> 00:24:22,740
wherever you want to call it.
And,

608
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,290
and um,
I've never been the same.

609
00:24:26,291 --> 00:24:29,810
I look at life different.
I look at people differently and um,

610
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,290
that you experienced that can't even
express really,

611
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,810
it's almost like dying and being real
reborn.

612
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,900
Yeah.
I had

613
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,440
the exact same experience.
That's what it felt like to me too.

614
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,740
Like you stop existing,
the five methoxy is,

615
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:44,870
uh,
there's two coming with the deal with

616
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:46,160
that.
What the Hell's going on here?

617
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,300
Five minutes is produced by your brain,
but what it is is,

618
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:53,090
uh,
it's dmt with an oxygen molecule

619
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:58,091
attached to it to so regular DMT is n n
dimethyltryptamine and then five methoxy

620
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:04,271
dimethyltryptamine dmt with like a very,
there's a very subtle change to the

621
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,910
molecule.
And that subtle change for some reason

622
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,190
takes away the visuals you've done
regular dmt to,

623
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,030
right.
Yes.

624
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,180
Regular DMT is rich with visuals.
Very strained,

625
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,260
bright,
colorful,

626
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:17,000
impossible.
Described visuals.

627
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:17,860
Yeah.
If,

628
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,840
um,
if inconceivable,

629
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,300
inconceivable is best with here
viewable.

630
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,160
But I tried to explain it to some
people,

631
00:25:24,161 --> 00:25:25,660
my wife and I use,
it's just,

632
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:28,180
I don't have the words to explain it.
That's exactly what I would say.

633
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:30,610
I've done a terrible job explaining it
to everybody.

634
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:32,770
Every time I've tried it just doesn't
work.

635
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,121
Um,
with the,

636
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:35,470
all those things,
they,

637
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:38,230
they give you perspective almost like
you're dying.

638
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,600
You have your,
your submissive,

639
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,920
you're humble,
you know what I mean?

640
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:45,310
You're vulnerable,
but you're invincible still in awe,

641
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,110
you know?
It's just that weird feeling,

642
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,990
but you feel like you're part of the
universe when you're,

643
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:52,870
you're separate from your ego.
You realize this whole thing.

644
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:55,590
You're a part of this whole thing and
this whole thing is unstoppable.

645
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,640
It's just,
it's a gigantic,

646
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,160
huge,
all encompassing,

647
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,220
almost like a living thing.
I know,

648
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,960
John,
this is where I also realize too,

649
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:08,060
I have to go into that experience.
You realize how insignificant you are

650
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:10,000
sometimes without your ego.
Yes.

651
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,460
You know you made,
why are you not really much that you

652
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:14,440
really thought you were?
Yeah,

653
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,760
you are and you aren't.

654
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,100
Obviously you are in everyday life.
I mean,

655
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:20,500
you go places,
you have a dramatic effect on people.

656
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,750
You mean a lot.
He mean a lot to those people that you

657
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:24,520
run into.
You mean a lot to the people that you

658
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:29,030
love and that love you,
but we all do and when the no one,

659
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:29,620
Stan,
no,

660
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,660
it's all,
it's all relative.

661
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,080
No one,
no one has a replaceable,

662
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:39,280
but everyone is special to someone or
something and at least to themselves,

663
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,760
but we're all the same.
We're all part of this weird,

664
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,700
crazy,
gigantic organism.

665
00:26:44,701 --> 00:26:45,690
That's the human race,

666
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,020
you know,
thought that you said it.

667
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,330
My mental cus d'amato hit objective with
the think of nothing.

668
00:26:50,331 --> 00:26:52,510
You're nothing.
Nothing is nothing but the objective,

669
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:55,370
the job.
And that was the psychological warfare.

670
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,690
You know,
nothing matters.

671
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:57,471
You're nothing,
nothing.

672
00:26:57,471 --> 00:27:00,620
My only thing that matters is the
objective and getting to accomplishing

673
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,140
that objective by going to these methods
of boxing.

674
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,950
Do you ever stop and think about how
fortunate was you ran into that guy?

675
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,530
Listen,
till this day,

676
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:11,900
I really don't understand that though.
How did this happen?

677
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,570
Because so many lives and by the time I
was born,

678
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:16,880
he was 66 years old by the time I was
born.

679
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,803
Yeah.

680
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:21,000
Crazy.
So many people could,

681
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,960
you know,
can't even explain it.

682
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:27,130
It's a magnificent individual.
He was an amazing guy,

683
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,840
amazing part of boxing and uh,
uh,

684
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,340
with uh,
unprecedented grasp of the mindset

685
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:37,960
required for combat sports.
That was the thing that,

686
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,390
that always really stood out about him.
Like he was a guy that was so,

687
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,260
he was so well versed in the mindset
that would listen to his,

688
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,390
his speeches,
that he would talk when he would talk

689
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:50,070
about you and he would talk about
boxing.

690
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:54,600
We talk about fear and about fear can be
like a fire can cook your food,

691
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,360
your food,
or it can burn your house down and you

692
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,500
have to,
you have to control it.

693
00:27:58,501 --> 00:27:59,760
And when he would describe it like it
would,

694
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,360
it would be so enlightening.
He was such a man of wisdom that when he

695
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:05,310
would describe things,
they would sink in.

696
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,000
They would,
they would,

697
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,400
they would,
somebody could say the same thing,

698
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,390
but the w w with him,
he had so much

699
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,780
life.
He was so many,

700
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,760
half of the psychiatry through the dock
to the father,

701
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:16,630
the mother,
you know,

702
00:28:16,631 --> 00:28:20,010
he was just all around that individual.
Yeah.

703
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,913
And with the,

704
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,580
an amazing knowledge of boxing.
And for guy like you,

705
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,050
it was almost like it was

706
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,630
Dane.
And I thought all we filled with meant

707
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:30,130
for me to meet this guy because I had no
way.

708
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:31,330
In a million years.
Everybody say,

709
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,070
no way.
You're gonna be champion too small.

710
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,150
Yeah.
The two,

711
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,781
sure.
No Way.

712
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:37,690
These guys are too big for you.
He says this is the greatest fight ever

713
00:28:37,691 --> 00:28:38,400
lived.
This and that.

714
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,550
The only thing is about me,
I'm like,

715
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,200
Oh God,
this guy's just swooped me up.

716
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,880
I never thought I could achieve what he
was saying and things he was saying was

717
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,880
just so,
um,

718
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,370
gigantic in my eye that,
yeah.

719
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,923
Yeah.
I mean

720
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,080
when it all happened and it turned out
that he was true and you have to absorb

721
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,630
all this when you're 20 years old,
you know,

722
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,000
it's,
I always say this about Justin Bieber

723
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,180
and I don't think Justin bieber nearly
had to deal with what you had to deal

724
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:05,700
with your,
your experience with so much crazier

725
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:08,400
because you were not just an incredibly
famous guy.

726
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:11,550
You were the baddest man on the planet.
So there was like an aura to you.

727
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:13,170
Everywhere you went,
people wanted to see you.

728
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,600
You know,
50 year old men don't give a fuck about

729
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:16,590
Justin bieber.
You know,

730
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:18,730
no disrespect.
He's a great guy,

731
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:20,430
a great singer,
but it's not.

732
00:29:20,431 --> 00:29:22,530
He's like young girls for young girls
like guys,

733
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:24,240
unbelievably famous,
but he's,

734
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,340
he's been famous since he was a little
kid.

735
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,130
I'm like,
how when people hear about them going

736
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,540
right?
Amazing.

737
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,910
When people hear about him going insane,
I'm like,

738
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:35,970
of course he's going insane.
You have no idea what it would be like

739
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:38,580
to be him.
It'll be 17 years old and girls

740
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,950
literally trying to break into his house
to throw a pussy.

741
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,150
Adam did coming

742
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,090
down.
Chimneys,

743
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,580
they're flying in on parishes are doing
anything they can.

744
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:47,950
They just want to be around them and you
want him to be normal.

745
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,730
Poor guy.
No one can handle that.

746
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,690
What kind of music you're listening to?
I listen to everything that I do.

747
00:29:58,691 --> 00:30:01,270
I listen to.
I was in a lot of classic rock for

748
00:30:01,271 --> 00:30:02,710
whatever reason.
But uh,

749
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:04,920
I've been listening to a lot of Kanye
West over the last few weeks.

750
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,760
Tell me what he talking about.
Kanye.

751
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,040
Yeah,
well he's talking about a lot of crazy

752
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,140
shit he's taught.
He actually talked about dmt in one of

753
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:13,150
his recent songs.
Think he did that before.

754
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,830
I think he did.
Oh Man.

755
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,660
Well I know he's friends with kid cuddie
kid cut.

756
00:30:17,661 --> 00:30:21,010
He'd been in here and kid cut.
He's had some psychedelic experiences.

757
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,650
Yeah.
Once you go to is just,

758
00:30:22,651 --> 00:30:24,730
um,
you didn't want to do nothing else

759
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:25,564
again.

760
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,420
Well,
it puts it all in the perspective.

761
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,250
It lets you see that,
uh,

762
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,110
as much as this thing seems to be
important is all temporary and you're a

763
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:39,880
part of forever and it also allows you
to become comfortable with death.

764
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

765
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:46,470
You know who said that?
Larry Hagman remember that Guy Dallas Jr

766
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,910
Salad?
He did an interview with CNN and I dream

767
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:49,930
of Jeannie as well.
Yeah,

768
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,390
that's right.
He sprung it on him on CNN.

769
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:54,430
Once he was talking about how he did
acid,

770
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,910
he took a big dose acid and he's never
worried about death ever again.

771
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:03,030
That it just alleviated his,
his worry about passing on as,

772
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:04,300
wow.
This if that could,

773
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:06,730
I felt the same way.
I feel I haven't doesn't matter anymore.

774
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,640
Yeah.
I think dnt even more specifically

775
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:10,860
because they think,
yeah,

776
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,820
what that does fake the mine that way.
What causes the effect of mine that way

777
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,070
they don't know.

778
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:20,170
They didn't mean Gig visioning,
visualize everything.

779
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,940
Um,
they don't totally know.

780
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,550
They know that your brain makes it.
They know that your body makes it,

781
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:27,220
they should say and they know that it's
produced in your liver and their lungs

782
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,560
and there's some evidence now cause they
found it in rats,

783
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,110
that the pineal gland produces it,
which is like,

784
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,520
that's the third eye of eastern
mysticism that Glenn actually in rats,

785
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,970
they've proven produces dmt and they
think it does so on people too.

786
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:40,820
You know,
once I did,

787
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,000
I wanted to do it again and again and
again.

788
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,340
And if they shouldn't do too much,
my wife with me,

789
00:31:45,341 --> 00:31:46,250
I got to,
you know,

790
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,370
grasp what's going on here.
Why am I feeling,

791
00:31:48,371 --> 00:31:50,650
it's like why?
Why did this in a weird way,

792
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:53,260
like humbled you?
I don't think you should listen to the

793
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:54,730
people say you shouldn't,
you know too much.

794
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,470
I think you should do it as much as you
want.

795
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,180
I thought I agree with too.
Yeah,

796
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,380
I agree.
You could handle it.

797
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,910
If you can handle being like Tyson,
you can handle doing dmt issues,

798
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,790
emt.
Yeah,

799
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,110
that's what I think I'm going,
I'm like,

800
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,700
I'm going in that direction.
Well,

801
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,590
I mean it's not something you just do
all day everyday,

802
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,710
but you can learn a lot from it.
It's the,

803
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:13,090
and it's,
it's very beneficial and very strange

804
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:15,580
that it's illegal.
You know that it's illegal.

805
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,820
Yeah.
Notice that Terence Mckenna had a joke

806
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:21,670
about it because your body's making it
so everybody's holding,

807
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,030
we all have it.
You know,

808
00:32:25,031 --> 00:32:27,130
it's illegal,
but it's like making blooded legal.

809
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,560
Everybody has.
And then why would he go to scenario

810
00:32:29,561 --> 00:32:31,810
deadly when they find these tolls?
Yeah.

811
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,630
Yeah.
I've never experienced it from the toad

812
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:39,631
of owning a television where the way
they extracted grab them and they buses

813
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,030
pimples and the busing on the class a
marrow and then take it off and he let

814
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:44,864
it harden.

815
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,251
Yeah.
Yeah.

816
00:32:45,251 --> 00:32:47,050
They,
they let it dry in the summer,

817
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,200
scrape it off with the razor blade.
I've only had it synthetically made in a

818
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,480
laboratory.
You smelled a buy it online.

819
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:56,870
Used to be able to buy like a fucking
can of it,

820
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,120
like this big enough to get like a whole
state high.

821
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,270
She's just buy it online.
It was totally legal.

822
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,140
Credible.
Yeah.

823
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:04,340
It's weird.
It's bizarre.

824
00:33:04,341 --> 00:33:06,470
That is illegal.
Well,

825
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:08,360
they would say not for human consumption
and,

826
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,770
but I don't know.
What the fuck are you doing with it if

827
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:11,660
you're not using it for human
consumption,

828
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,210
but you,
you used to be able to buy it.

829
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,140
I've never felt anything like that
before.

830
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,120
No.
Nothing like that makes me not want to

831
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,460
do anything.
Nothing else can supersede that.

832
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,540
How long ago did it happen?
I don't know.

833
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,540
Around two months ago.
Yeah.

834
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,980
Did you write down what happened after
it happened or did you record it?

835
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,970
No,
I will shut that.

836
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,450
Yeah,
we should that.

837
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,250
Yeah,
me too.

838
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,020
If you'd like,
it goes away like a dream.

839
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,730
Right.
And comes off,

840
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:35,250
you know,
you're,

841
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,680
you're so scared.
You know stuff,

842
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:37,390
stuff like that.

843
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:37,781
Like,
no,

844
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:38,614
no,
no.

845
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,220
Hey,
I want this to stop now.

846
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:46,951
And the guy was like,
hey,

847
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:48,060
you're on the ride.
And I'm like,

848
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:48,781
no,
no,

849
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:51,540
no.
I love it.

850
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,010
I love you.
I love you.

851
00:33:53,011 --> 00:33:53,844
I love you.

852
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,500
Yeah.
I love everybody.

853
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:57,000
Yeah,
so spassed out.

854
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,840
Yeah.
Did you have a hard time letting go at

855
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:03,950
the beginning of fighting me?
I don't think stop wanting to stop now.

856
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,850
Just jump.
Stop the shit now.

857
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,530
Stopping.
The guy was like,

858
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:08,631
hey,
the show.

859
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,820
I'm like,
I can do it.

860
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,310
Got to go for the ride,
dude.

861
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,830
And it was like,
whoa man.

862
00:34:13,831 --> 00:34:14,840
Fuck,
I'm dying.

863
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,220
Things are going in my film theme,
the Aztec things.

864
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,400
I'm being told I'm going to seeing weird
animal.

865
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:21,690
The thing that you're flying,
it's just,

866
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,840
it's like another chamber.
It's boom flashing food and he'd gone to

867
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:27,900
take a rocker.
You taking off foom.

868
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:30,900
Yeah.
It's beyond your imagination.

869
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,410
Yeah.
DEF is inconceivable.

870
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:36,570
Can't even explain it to no one.
Well,

871
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:37,404
I'm hoping

872
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,960
that they,
they start with psilocybin because a,

873
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,000
I know maps there.
They're doing some great work with that.

874
00:34:45,001 --> 00:34:48,420
Trying to get these things legalize
especially they're doing mtma studies

875
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,810
with veterans and people with Ptsd and
they're having great results.

876
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,230
They're moving in the civil side bend.
They would love to get silicide been

877
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:57,450
legal and it's up for ballot.
I think it was in Oregon.

878
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,750
Is that where it is?
It's up for,

879
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,610
I think Oregon is up for legalization
this year and it may be eventually in

880
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:04,160
California as well.
They may hate him.

881
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,560
Go do it.
It should be legal.

882
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,550
It doesn't kill anybody.
It should be,

883
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,590
it's not a bad thing if they regulate
it,

884
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,340
if they make it for therapeutic use and
just set up centers where experts can

885
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:16,110
show,
but they shouldn't make it prohibitive

886
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:17,880
for people to own it or even grow their
own.

887
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,390
It's not a bad idea to set up places
where people can do it.

888
00:35:21,391 --> 00:35:24,840
Under a professionals care,
a showman's care.

889
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,520
Physicians Care,
that's a good idea,

890
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,270
but making it illegal is a bad idea
because it helps a lot of people,

891
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,430
you know,
people think of it as a party drug.

892
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:35,490
They think you're going to do mushrooms
and freak out and go fucking run around

893
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:38,910
naked and La was do mushrooms.
I love mushrooms.

894
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,530
Yeah,
well psilocybin and DMT or very closely

895
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:47,040
related chemically.
All those really potent psychedelic

896
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:51,210
drugs are very closely related.
They all break down in,

897
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,220
in some similar path inside your brain
and,

898
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,230
and give you

899
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,850
that,
that weird

900
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,200
ego dissolving experience.
Yeah.

901
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,730
That's one thing.
Most of the drugs you do it,

902
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:05,310
most of them.
Um,

903
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,910
Eagle enhancing,
right?

904
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,870
Like coke.
Yeah.

905
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:12,871
He likes some of the baddest mother and
he had gone and yeah.

906
00:36:13,601 --> 00:36:14,890
You know,
you've never had coffee.

907
00:36:14,891 --> 00:36:16,300
I've never had coke.
Never,

908
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,680
never.
Oh Man.

909
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,940
No.
You didn't miss out as nothing,

910
00:36:21,941 --> 00:36:22,774
man.

911
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,660
Yeah.
That one I ducked when I was in high

912
00:36:26,661 --> 00:36:29,110
school.
My friend's cousin used to sell it and

913
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,840
he,
he,

914
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,680
he wasted away to nothing.
Knew him and his girlfriend would hang

915
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:35,510
out in the attic and never come out.
They would just sell coke and watch TV.

916
00:36:35,511 --> 00:36:38,720
It was bad.
Like it was like a vampire bit him.

917
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,970
Aw Man.
He came up once you get in that kind of

918
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,570
vicious cycle.
It's a wrap.

919
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,570
Yeah.
Yeah.

920
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,750
So I ducked it.
Adopted early,

921
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,340
never did coke man was the first time he
did coke.

922
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,000
I Dunno,
it was kid 11,

923
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,130
12.
I got involved with drug early in life.

924
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,500
Wow.
That's crazy.

925
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,360
Uh,
1112.

926
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:07,170
Yeah.
I was still living in Brownsville,

927
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,970
Brooklyn when I first did cocaine.
Wow.

928
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,950
That's a crazy,
listen,

929
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,150
I would never let my children have a 10
year old daughter and eight year olds.

930
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:20,070
I would never let them look.
The life that I live,

931
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,740
I will hate thousand away fight for her
to live with and be in an environment

932
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,020
that I grew up in.
Yeah,

933
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,120
of course.
Well,

934
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,820
you know,
you have the benefit of having gone

935
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:30,200
through it.
You know?

936
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:33,610
No one else could ever understand how,
how,

937
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,570
how difficult any of your life must've
been for you.

938
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,690
It's gotta be one of the harder things
when,

939
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,310
when you did that documentary to amazing
documentary,

940
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,720
when you're very honest,
you're very honest and you're very open

941
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,820
about all your experiences.
And the one thing I took away after

942
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:49,230
that,
like no one can understand.

943
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,330
You could,
you could hear a guy talk like this.

944
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,690
I could hear you say these things.
I could see the videos of your fights to

945
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,890
see the videos,
your experience,

946
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,650
but to understand the life that you
lived,

947
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,740
it's impossible to,
it's just a guess.

948
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,020
It's like a guest.
For someone like me from the outside,

949
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:07,040
it's just really interested in it.
Look,

950
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,970
I think about this young kid,
Brooklyn,

951
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:12,560
and you come to the cuff though tomorrow
at 1312 you know,

952
00:38:12,561 --> 00:38:15,860
and I'll something all of a sudden have
a low self esteem.

953
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:19,310
This guy gives me this big fucking ego,
you know what I mean?

954
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:20,190
I live by the,
you know,

955
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,910
I live by the rules of that ego and
that's,

956
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,100
and I have accomplished so much in a
dominator ego.

957
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,930
Yeah,
you're,

958
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,420
you're,
you're,

959
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,240
you're set.
Oh,

960
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,210
about destroying people.
Yeah.

961
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,860
Just anybody.
It could be a lawyer,

962
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,810
200 pounds.
I'm staring you down.

963
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,950
It's just weird environment up that way,

964
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,300
you know,
cause we have people,

965
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:39,820
we try to avoid fights,
you know what I mean?

966
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,960
Right.
From my instincts,

967
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:44,170
we avoid fights for all our lives and
just to be able to see what you do.

968
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:45,970
Like you UFC guy,
you're a fighter.

969
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,000
This is what you do for a job,
a lifestyle.

970
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,300
That's pretty bizarre.
You were getting positive reinforcement

971
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:54,490
from thinking like that for the first
time in your life.

972
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,530
Absolutely.
Yeah.

973
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,170
I never felt like that before.
We like taking up a big drug.

974
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,250
Elution has boomi.
It felt like get a man and then

975
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,230
everybody's telling you you're great.
Yeah.

976
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,050
You know,
for the first time in your life,

977
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,140
never understood that.
And you know what else customer I used

978
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:10,390
to do with me,
he used to take me to a hypnotist.

979
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,740
He was the hitting detention as well.
Yeah.

980
00:39:11,741 --> 00:39:15,610
They used to go in the
hypnotist motions.

981
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,000
What kind of Shit did they make you?
Do you know how they do it?

982
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,530
Yes.
You relax,

983
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:24,340
you go under,
you totally focus on blackness.

984
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:26,870
Nothing that's right.
And you go under and yes,

985
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,990
being savage,
intelligent avenue.

986
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,831
Animal,
yes.

987
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:31,000
Work.
And you're going to do this.

988
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,490
You're going to be a ferocious animal.
You're going to fight,

989
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,390
puff,
put both hands to the body,

990
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:36,141
your these,
your jab,

991
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:39,970
you to do this and ferocious fashion.
And they picked all that in me.

992
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:42,430
If I was younger and you were like 1213
years old.

993
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:44,620
Wow.
So they're putting you under and just

994
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:46,420
teaching you that mindset.
Yeah.

995
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,450
Whoa.
Did he give you any advice on how to

996
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:51,160
shut it off?
No.

997
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,250
He's probably like,
I don't have any time.

998
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,690
Let me time.
The kid is 13.

999
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:03,010
How old is because there's no time,
no time.

1000
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:04,450
I'm not going to teach them the off
switch.

1001
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:05,620
Just hit the gas.

1002
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,530
Therefore the word,
the gas destroyed,

1003
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:09,940
he's got,
he's got in our way of,

1004
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,140
you know what I mean?
Greatness.

1005
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:11,840
Glory.

1006
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,650
It's one of the hardest things that many
fighters I've,

1007
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,430
that I've watched over the years have
the problem of shutting it off.

1008
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,480
Like turning it on and living like that
and just wanting to be a dominator.

1009
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,770
But then learning how to be a father.
Learning how to be

1010
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:30,470
man,
my friend and my first lifetime with

1011
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:32,150
children and stuff,
trying to do this stuff.

1012
00:40:32,151 --> 00:40:33,170
Man,
I feel filled.

1013
00:40:33,171 --> 00:40:34,790
The disasters,
they,

1014
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,780
you know,
it's just,

1015
00:40:35,781 --> 00:40:38,900
um,
I had no idea what I was doing too.

1016
00:40:38,901 --> 00:40:41,870
I had no idea what it was,
what arena was stepping into.

1017
00:40:41,871 --> 00:40:44,220
It was just,
it was just a disaster.

1018
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,620
I find out,
uh,

1019
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,210
I spend most of my adult life now I'm
apologizing to my kids.

1020
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:51,070
You know what I mean?
Yeah,

1021
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,260
yeah.
I can imagine me a horrible father.

1022
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,150
Do you think they understand the shit
that you were going through?

1023
00:40:58,151 --> 00:40:58,820
They understand.
Yeah.

1024
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,950
I have no idea.
No.

1025
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:05,180
I don't know.
I tried to basically make sure that part

1026
00:41:05,181 --> 00:41:08,600
of my life is empty now.
The different life for my kids and

1027
00:41:08,601 --> 00:41:10,100
family now.
Yeah.

1028
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,440
Well that's beautiful.
It's beautiful that you,

1029
00:41:12,441 --> 00:41:13,250
you,
you,

1030
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,040
like Tom was saying earlier,
you have a lot of self reflection.

1031
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,940
You've,
you've managed to look at your life and,

1032
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,990
and find out what's,
what has value to you and what helps

1033
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:21,730
you.

1034
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,790
You always have to do self evaluation.
I mean,

1035
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,930
it's a strong believer in that if
somebody has to check you,

1036
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,090
you have to check yourself.

1037
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,150
I agree.
Yeah.

1038
00:41:29,151 --> 00:41:30,680
Well,
especially a guy like you who's,

1039
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,450
you know,
you're,

1040
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,650
you've been checked,
your ego's checked,

1041
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,040
your life

1042
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,760
has been checked if it's so many down
moments as well as up moments.

1043
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,910
You've had the,
the full ride of experiences.

1044
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,540
Never with Avaya with my ego being
chicken and no idea that that wasn't

1045
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,480
what it was about.
So you thought if your ego checked,

1046
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:49,760
you would go and be nothing when I,
my ego.

1047
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,620
Wow.
Yeah.

1048
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,480
Well,
I mean it makes sense when you're going

1049
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:56,540
through all that hypnosis when you're 12
and 13 years old.

1050
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,560
But that's a crazy thing to do to a kid
because it was sand.

1051
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,670
No idea.
But I wanted to do it so bad.

1052
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:04,160
I wouldn't succeed so bad.
You could tell,

1053
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,520
you know,
I watched a video of you a real

1054
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:09,620
recently,
you were about 16,

1055
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,930
16,
17 years old and you were sparring with

1056
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:15,950
some big guy who was a professional
heavyweight and you were,

1057
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,710
uh,
it was what was fascinating to me about,

1058
00:42:17,711 --> 00:42:20,450
it wasn't just watching move around when
you were young and still learning,

1059
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,720
but it was also,
you were upset at yourself after it was

1060
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:24,110
over.

1061
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,070
You didn't think it went well.
And,

1062
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:26,790
and I was like,
Oh,

1063
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,890
remember that?
You don't remember.

1064
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,120
It was,
it was an interesting video,

1065
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:29,900
man.
You were like,

1066
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,670
I didn't go well,
I could tell it didn't go well.

1067
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,000
I was a thick perfectionists.
That's what I was going to say and it

1068
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:37,400
seemed like it like you were obsessed as
my whole life.

1069
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,350
That's all I did was look at Bucklin
Watch Bach,

1070
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,220
the read about fighters and it was all
about fighting the fight of the,

1071
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,370
my God,
Fido,

1072
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,010
you know that kind of stuff.
Fight after I want to be around them and

1073
00:42:46,011 --> 00:42:49,550
be their groupie.
That's another amazing imagine that you

1074
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,520
also knew Jim Jacobs and that's fucking
fight library.

1075
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,150
That's watched films up to El hazing.
This is pre vhs,

1076
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,260
right.
Beat people at Vhs,

1077
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:01,290
but not many and there's fight.
Those fights were not vhs away mentally

1078
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:03,770
for like if you didn't,
if you missed the fight,

1079
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:04,880
you weren't going to see it again.

1080
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:05,740
Right?
Yeah.

1081
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:10,580
Paypal and Jim Jacobs,
he kept those things on like a regular

1082
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:15,350
old projector type thing.
If you listen to the voiceover on some

1083
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:17,330
of those old fights,
it's Jim Jacobs.

1084
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,030
Yeah,
it's him doing commentary on some of the

1085
00:43:20,031 --> 00:43:21,890
old fights.
It didn't have any phones study.

1086
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,020
All these guys all day and all night.
You study though.

1087
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,060
Yeah.
He was through you.

1088
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:29,300
That I learned about a lot of fighters
when you were talking about Jack Dempsey

1089
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:31,460
and talk about different fighters from
the old days.

1090
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,110
I learned about a lot of those guys from
you and went back and watched some of

1091
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:39,100
those tapes and now it's beautiful.
Now you can just get on youtube and you

1092
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,930
see whatever you want to see everything,
see all of it.

1093
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:45,290
But to go back and watch my was away
from my office in precedent.

1094
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:46,760
If you're going to feed this.
Yeah,

1095
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,460
they shout exactly.

1096
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,900
I can't wait.
I want you to come by.

1097
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,830
Um,
cause we ran two and the ranch's I'm in,

1098
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:55,130
um,
productive.

1099
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,350
It's going to be off.
So you said 2022?

1100
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,340
Yeah.
So,

1101
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,360
uh,
four year.

1102
00:43:59,361 --> 00:43:59,931
What does it,
yeah,

1103
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:01,280
four years from now,
three years from now.

1104
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,600
We pretty awesome.
Yeah.

1105
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:03,770
That's awesome.
Well,

1106
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,130
the plans look amazing.
You know how long you guys been working

1107
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:08,520
towards this a,
listen,

1108
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,840
we have seen the property and then um,
we purchased it and we were just,

1109
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,020
um,
we were just overwhelmed with this.

1110
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:16,970
It's probably what?
I don't know.

1111
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:18,640
Maybe a year ago,
maybe even that.

1112
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,110
Maybe,
maybe a year or so.

1113
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,000
You didn't have,
are you going to have a gym up there?

1114
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,380
Hey,
I never thought it,

1115
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:26,260
but we will have because we don't have
the wellness center.

1116
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:28,040
Yeah,
Dude.

1117
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,010
How great would it be if you taught like
a boxing class?

1118
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:34,800
I know about that stuff though.
We got to hang out there and work out.

1119
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:37,440
Just a fun box in class,
like hitting the heavy bag.

1120
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,270
Just something fun.
You don't have to get people beating

1121
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:41,520
each other up.
Do you know how much people would pay to

1122
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:44,930
smoke weed and come where had a box from
you smoke weed.

1123
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,990
Do you smoke weed with people?
Just regular folks.

1124
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:49,620
Yeah,
it's,

1125
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,700
look we,
yeah.

1126
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:52,410
I was trying to get my wife to smoke
with me.

1127
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:53,280
No,
she doesn't smoke.

1128
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:56,250
She smoked only at nighttime.
She can't function during the daytime.

1129
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:56,781
Oh,
right,

1130
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:57,840
right.
During the day.

1131
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,470
Well,
I would imagine if I was a mother it

1132
00:45:01,471 --> 00:45:03,510
would be very hard to get high because I
get paranoid.

1133
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,900
You know?
I'd be a lot fun.

1134
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,820
She doesn't do it during the day.
At night.

1135
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,440
It's different.
Smoke,

1136
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:10,370
a little weed,
relaxed.

1137
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:13,400
How did you ever do any fighting?
I did kickboxing and how many

1138
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,500
tournaments?
I was,

1139
00:45:15,501 --> 00:45:18,140
uh,
I was pretty good at taekwondo.

1140
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,640
I won a bunch of state championships and
won a few national.

1141
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:23,581
What did he do?
You know,

1142
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:26,640
you wanted to get physical in another
human being and do this stuff.

1143
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:27,150
Can,
you know,

1144
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,250
you can't be in the right frame of mind
and want to do this stuff.

1145
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:34,370
Got To realize that I was this stuff and
not in the right frame of mind and half

1146
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,200
dealing with fear drives you insane.
Deal with that.

1147
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,200
Drives people insane.
I was insane during my career.

1148
00:45:40,201 --> 00:45:41,970
Yes.
Madly and staying from fear.

1149
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:42,510
Yeah.

1150
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,570
Obviously I never went through anything
like the level that you went through,

1151
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:47,880
but for these full contact taekwondo
fights,

1152
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:51,510
I was always scared and uh,
but I was scared before that I was

1153
00:45:51,511 --> 00:45:53,190
bullied.
I moved around a lot.

1154
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:57,210
I was a little kid.
I was never very big and we moved from

1155
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:59,970
New Jersey to San Francisco when I was
seven,

1156
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:04,410
from San Francisco to Florida.
When I was 11 Florida to Boston when I

1157
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:09,411
was 14 or 13 so it's just always moving
a new schools always deal with new kids

1158
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:13,530
and I wasn't big and I didn't know how
to fight and I got picked on and I

1159
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:14,640
didn't like it.
So I said,

1160
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:16,710
I wanna I want to figure out how to
fight.

1161
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:20,100
And so I started getting into martial
arts and I just became obsessed with it.

1162
00:46:20,101 --> 00:46:21,600
I did it every day.
I started teaching.

1163
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,660
I was teaching at Boston University is
teaching a taekwondo course.

1164
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,280
When I was 19 I was competing from the
time I was 15 I just threw myself into

1165
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:30,600
it.
It's all I did every day I worked at the

1166
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,130
school.
I was there every day.

1167
00:46:32,131 --> 00:46:33,300
I had the keys,
I closed up,

1168
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:36,240
I opened up where I am because of you,
because of hearing about you.

1169
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:39,330
When you were running in the morning,
when you knew that everybody else was

1170
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:40,470
asleep,
that gave you an edge.

1171
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,960
I go there in the middle of the night
and open up and work out.

1172
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:45,870
I just wanted to just have an edge,
you know?

1173
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:47,280
And I've listened to what you said and I
said,

1174
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:49,800
that's a great way to have an edge.
I became obsessed with it,

1175
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,180
but there was no future in it.
And then what happened was I went from

1176
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:57,330
taekwondo to kickboxing and when I
started kickboxing,

1177
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:01,050
I started getting fucked up.
Do's are beating the shit out of me

1178
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:04,140
because I was realizing like I can't
keep people at the same distance anymore

1179
00:47:04,141 --> 00:47:05,880
cause I didn't know how to use my hands
properly.

1180
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:08,730
Like I knew how to throw some punches a
little bit from taekwondo,

1181
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:11,940
but it's not nearly sophisticated as
boxing or kickboxing.

1182
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,090
And so then I started kickboxing
training and then I started realizing

1183
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:16,860
like there's no future in it.
It's like,

1184
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:18,990
what am I doing?
I'm just getting my brains beat in,

1185
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,540
you know,
and I'm hard sparring.

1186
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:24,810
Two of the sparring was rough.
It was Boston style.

1187
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:27,180
Put the gloves on and beat the shit out
of each other.

1188
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:28,014
Figure it out as you

1189
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,090
yeah.
Ain't going shit.

1190
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:34,000
So a lot of headaches and you know,
but it was,

1191
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:36,420
um,
it was hard for me to,

1192
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:39,460
to shut that part of me off the part of
me,

1193
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:42,100
they just wanted to conquer the part of
me just wanting to win all the time to

1194
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:44,320
figure out a way to be more intense,
more driven,

1195
00:47:44,321 --> 00:47:46,720
more focused.
But when I did stop fighting,

1196
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:51,750
it was a huge relief.
Like the relief part was worth the extra

1197
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:55,300
anxiety that I got.
It was worth it just for the relief of

1198
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:58,060
not,
not thinking about fighting all the

1199
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:00,310
time,
not thinking about when's the next

1200
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,230
tournament,
when's the next event?

1201
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:04,750
When's the next thing I'm doing?
It was just,

1202
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:06,570
wait.
Well,

1203
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,550
for you it had to be way crazy because
not only is it the weight,

1204
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,410
it's the heavyweight championship of the
world.

1205
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,110
I always wanted to make my mentor happy.
Yeah.

1206
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,740
That was my goal,
to make him happy when he died.

1207
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:19,920
Was it weird not having a person like
that?

1208
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,210
My,
and it was so,

1209
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,640
man,
it was just emptiness.

1210
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,890
It was just,
and then people who we go with our

1211
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:27,670
friends and that we say we're going to
be good too.

1212
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,450
They started when he died,
they started going in for the kill.

1213
00:48:30,451 --> 00:48:32,970
You just want to grab me for means.

1214
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,380
Well it seemed like you and Kevin Rooney
had a good combination at the beginning

1215
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,880
when he died,
when,

1216
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,773
when customers,

1217
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:44,020
we didn't know what we're going to do.
They're thinking about getting rid of

1218
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,820
Kevin and said,
and I was saying I didn't want to be

1219
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:48,880
with nobody else.
I was comfortable with Kevin and the

1220
00:48:48,881 --> 00:48:50,700
style and the way we were going.
I didn't want to be in oil.

1221
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,191
So I said,
no,

1222
00:48:51,191 --> 00:48:52,210
let's just keep Kevin.

1223
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:54,570
Yeah.
And Kevin was a great training for me.

1224
00:48:54,571 --> 00:48:56,850
Very well respected trainer.
Yeah.

1225
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:00,240
It was a good relationship.
Like the way it worked in the beginning

1226
00:49:00,241 --> 00:49:02,970
it looked like,
but then like all things,

1227
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,620
you know,
Kevin used to train me and then fighting

1228
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:08,190
our finances and to call it.
Oh really?

1229
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:09,480
Yeah.
Wow.

1230
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,130
Wow.
And this was all like,

1231
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,200
was he training you um,
before,

1232
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,810
before cus died as well?
Well,

1233
00:49:18,811 --> 00:49:19,980
yeah.
How many,

1234
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:23,670
how many years before Christ died?
Was he like holding mitts for you and if

1235
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:25,530
the couple,
but he knew you well?

1236
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,680
Yes.
Did He,

1237
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,010
well,
did he watch fights with you as well?

1238
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:30,180
Did you or were you watching

1239
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:33,730
watch a fight?
The monthly arm started training with

1240
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:35,710
each other.
We started watching fights together

1241
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,800
because you're stuck.
That was the other thing to your style.

1242
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:43,670
The way you would come out was so
reminiscent of old fighters and when you

1243
00:49:43,671 --> 00:49:45,620
come out and no socks on black shoes.

1244
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,960
Wow.
That would think in my,

1245
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,450
my mind.
I think it was a lot about gladiator and

1246
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:52,690
via telephone and how another thing now
look at enough to look at I philly

1247
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:54,850
little philly kid.
Thank you.

1248
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,150
Tough.
I would think.

1249
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,100
I just can't thank you

1250
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,900
where you were tough man.
I know what you're saying.

1251
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,230
I know what you're saying.
But you were when you fought Marvis

1252
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,680
Fraser on what does the ABC,
maybe she had fight.

1253
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,560
I remember watching that fight going,
Holy Shit.

1254
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,020
Holy Shit.
It was like being locked into a ring

1255
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:15,270
with a tornado.
That was wild day.

1256
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:17,010
Yeah.
That was a tough kid.

1257
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:20,340
That was your peak.
That was when it was peak.

1258
00:50:20,341 --> 00:50:21,480
Scary.
You know,

1259
00:50:21,481 --> 00:50:23,490
you were coming up and everybody was
just terrified.

1260
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,760
It was just a wild thing to watch man.
To be a part it to be you.

1261
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,571
Yeah.
One of the,

1262
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:31,370
uh,
make my mentor happy though as my main

1263
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:32,270
goal and fighting.

1264
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,810
It's a powerful goal.
Yeah.

1265
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:40,510
Did you ever try to go back and get
hypnotized after all that's over the try

1266
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,810
to maybe calm down.
That part of your mind

1267
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:45,640
turned 'em I never did.
I had to do the toll,

1268
00:50:45,641 --> 00:50:47,610
I think helped me out the total.
Yeah,

1269
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,470
it definitely,
that stuff will help me out.

1270
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,440
Did we'd help you out at all?
I'm pretty much,

1271
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,333
yeah.
You know what I mean?

1272
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,620
But I had to do it every day.
I had to do it all the time.

1273
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,010
It all the time then yeah.
If I went to another country and I

1274
00:50:59,011 --> 00:51:01,310
didn't have my weed up at insane,
they what?

1275
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,880
No.
We're going to be here a couple of days

1276
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,140
a week.
A month.

1277
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,150
Get the hell out of here.

1278
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

1279
00:51:08,631 --> 00:51:10,490
The rest of the world will catch up
eventually.

1280
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,920
They'll catch up eventually.
It's slowly happening.

1281
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:15,710
We were talking about it before the show
started that just a few years ago,

1282
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,800
if you smoked weed you,
you felt like you were a criminal.

1283
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:20,780
Like you have to hide those.
I look around,

1284
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,840
you look around.
Who's got a cop still like that in New

1285
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,850
York?
I was in New York recently and we had a

1286
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,350
hyde weed.
That's crazy there.

1287
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,430
I'm like,
how is this New York City and

1288
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,630
antiquated,
so stupid.

1289
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,320
Just doesn't make any sense.
Especially when like we're both high

1290
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:38,270
right now then man,
the kite,

1291
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,400
it's fine.
Everything's good.

1292
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:45,170
Having a nice conversation.
I totally agree.

1293
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:49,160
How many fights did Jim Jacobs have in
that library?

1294
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:49,950
Oh,
no.

1295
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:53,640
Thousands of man.
I watch thousand guy fighting an 1890

1296
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:54,750
eighth west.
The mall.

1297
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,710
Wow.
Who were standouts for you outside of

1298
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,140
the standard,
like obviously Jack Johnson.

1299
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,780
Yeah,
he was awesome too.

1300
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:04,910
Um,
he was just amazing.

1301
00:52:04,911 --> 00:52:07,700
He was ahead of his time fighting it.
Some little guys like Tony,

1302
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:10,320
Kevin and Arie Hamdi,
Armstrong Barney Ross guy.

1303
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:13,190
It's like that Benny Leonard,
this guy that just,

1304
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,040
they evolve buckling through the level
where it can evolve too.

1305
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,260
Now they became,
they were superstars in that time.

1306
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,040
Who's that crazy middleweight who went
up to fight Jack Johnson and Charles

1307
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,060
Stanley Catcho.
That's right.

1308
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,100
He's a bad ad punch.
Yeah.

1309
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:27,020
He's a bad ass.
Then he got killed.

1310
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,480
Yeah.
I ain't got time.

1311
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,260
Yeah.
Cause cause he stole this guy's

1312
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:32,850
girlfriend and he was a tough guy.
Like what are you going to do about if

1313
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:33,411
Pete,
the guy,

1314
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:37,060
he'll be disrespected the guy and the
guy came back and shot him standing

1315
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,170
kitchen with a real wild and crazy guy.

1316
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,470
Well most of the greats were.
Yeah,

1317
00:52:41,471 --> 00:52:45,010
he was wild.
That's a new feel it then pay anyone.

1318
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,770
But when you talk about like your life
and like the way you were living,

1319
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,470
if you go back to most of the greats,
like Roberto Duran,

1320
00:52:50,471 --> 00:52:52,960
he was a wild mother fucker.
Beautiful.

1321
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,820
It was beautiful with that rhythm with
it.

1322
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,830
Yeah.
There's so many of the greats were just

1323
00:52:56,831 --> 00:52:58,030
wild,
wild people.

1324
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,890
You know?
I think that that fear that is pretty

1325
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:02,190
that out of you.
Yeah.

1326
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,560
But then there was some grades that were
just real disciplined,

1327
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:08,380
like struggling.
Marvin Hagler is my best example for

1328
00:53:08,381 --> 00:53:10,540
that.
When I was a kid growing up in Boston,

1329
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:12,190
Hagler was the middle weight champion of
the world,

1330
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,920
and I used to see,
they used to have video of him running.

1331
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,080
They played it on the news.
He was running on the,

1332
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:20,170
there was the dunes sand dunes and Cape
Cod in the winter,

1333
00:53:20,171 --> 00:53:22,300
freezing cold with a Hoodie on,
running,

1334
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:23,470
screaming war.

1335
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,560
Whoa.
Oh,

1336
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,710
it was amazing.
Marvin Hagler made you want to just get

1337
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:30,480
out of your house and go running in the
snow.

1338
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,400
You know,
he was so disciplined.

1339
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:34,710
That was the thing that I always got out
of watching him,

1340
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,890
wasn't that he was so wild.
He was so mentally strong.

1341
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,970
He had an iron chin and his discipline
was an impeccable,

1342
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:44,460
his deeds.
He was just constantly training.

1343
00:53:44,461 --> 00:53:46,860
Never add a shape,
never got fat.

1344
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:50,680
Always doing sit ups and push ups.
Some ferocious animal.

1345
00:53:50,681 --> 00:53:52,070
They through the body.
Yeah.

1346
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,190
Oh,
he was chiseled.

1347
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:55,560
He was a machine that fight with Tommy
hearns.

1348
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,630
Um,
that was one of the greatest

1349
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,600
middleweight and counters of all time
chaos.

1350
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,340
I mean it's,
we didn't know what was going to stop

1351
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,120
the fight.
The fight and Tommy hearing through,

1352
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:07,830
they'll be,
the winner is skillful.

1353
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,520
As they were,
they decided to just smash,

1354
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,930
just get into the center and fucking
foot.

1355
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,740
There was no like Tommy hearns control
to try to use his jab box in the house.

1356
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,620
Are you going to keep it?
You're not going to keep them for your

1357
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,653
dog.

1358
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,410
Try to take them out of the film with
crazy.

1359
00:54:24,411 --> 00:54:25,700
You can't back from like they,
you know,

1360
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:27,600
sugar ray Leonard did that.
They don't have,

1361
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,390
they weren't at their prime then.
Yeah.

1362
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:32,180
I wanted to see those two guys in their
prime is go at it.

1363
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,780
Yeah.
Sugar Ray Leonard.

1364
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:37,050
When especially when he fought Hagel,
he fought hygge or smart stay the fuck

1365
00:54:37,051 --> 00:54:39,540
away.
I heard the craziest rumor.

1366
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:44,541
Tell me if this is the craziest rumor
that Marvin Hagler like decided to bet

1367
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:50,841
on himself for that fight.
Didn't knew that he was going to lose.

1368
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,370
Like they had it set up and then retired
and went to Italy

1369
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,510
as a ridiculous rumor.
Right.

1370
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,190
And know what anybody did.
But on the,

1371
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:00,220
I never heard anything like that.
You never heard that one?

1372
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:01,113
No,

1373
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,300
but he's the more,
one of the most interesting end of

1374
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:04,970
careers.

1375
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:07,070
I heard a rumor that he didn't fight the
fight,

1376
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:09,030
that he should have fight that and he
should have fought.

1377
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:10,483
You know what I mean?

1378
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,290
Well,
the rumor was he went to Italy because

1379
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:13,370
the mob said everything.
Yeah.

1380
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:16,430
Something to that effect.
He went to Italy and became a giant

1381
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:19,040
movie star,
but he's the only guy that I can think

1382
00:55:19,041 --> 00:55:23,030
of in recent memory that literally went
out on top,

1383
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,390
had unbelievably close fight with sugar
ray Leonard,

1384
00:55:26,391 --> 00:55:28,010
who a lot of people think he could have
won that fight.

1385
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,410
Very close decision and then says,
that's it.

1386
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,550
See Ya,
I'm done.

1387
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:34,670
Everybody comes back.
Come back.

1388
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:39,020
Yeah.
I guess I'm at one time.

1389
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:40,510
That's your whole life.
I would think of my,

1390
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,950
I'm for prior then never came back.
That was just my whole life.

1391
00:55:42,951 --> 00:55:44,520
That was my whole identity.
Yeah.

1392
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:45,523
You know what I mean?

1393
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,600
But when you did retire and when you
retired in the ring,

1394
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:52,470
that was the most honest retirement
speech I've ever heard of box give ever.

1395
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:53,820
He's just like,
I don't,

1396
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:54,990
I don't have this in medium

1397
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,680
and once with him in the air anymore,
this is,

1398
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,440
um,
I looked pretty bizarre for myself even,

1399
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:02,230
Ya know,
cause this is what I base my life on

1400
00:56:02,231 --> 00:56:05,920
doing when I first started doing it.
If I'm a dedicate my life to this stuff.

1401
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:07,110
Okay.

1402
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,680
He gets to see that it's not even,
I'm no longer happened was pretty weird.

1403
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,840
When did you know that you didn't want
to do it anymore?

1404
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:16,530
I'm known years before that,
but I was still being very successful.

1405
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,510
Yeah.
Like when like what year?

1406
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:20,810
Like do you remember around when you
started thinking it?

1407
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,090
I don't remember.
Probably man,

1408
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,540
what?
The 2000 area.

1409
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:31,000
So by the time that that's post
holyfield yeah,

1410
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:31,834
after,
yeah.

1411
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:35,170
Then you just get it done too much.
I was just winning them.

1412
00:56:35,171 --> 00:56:36,820
You see winning beating guys,
you know,

1413
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:40,330
guys get hit with something and from to
be feel scared.

1414
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,910
Yeah.
What did,

1415
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,220
what did you have in mind?
Like that's the hardest thing,

1416
00:56:45,221 --> 00:56:47,800
right?
To to swing from that to the next thing.

1417
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,070
Like how do you take,
how do you take this crazy exciting

1418
00:56:51,071 --> 00:56:51,940
life?
Oh No,

1419
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,990
I thought I lifted.
Let me if get high for a while and

1420
00:56:55,991 --> 00:56:57,700
figured it out.
That was the plan.

1421
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,250
Yeah.
Let me party for a while to figure this

1422
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:03,580
stuff out.
What did you figure out?

1423
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:05,600
Um,
uh,

1424
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,180
I wanted to do other things.
So I started,

1425
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:12,181
my wife arranged for me to be the death
being on stage that she created the

1426
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,460
Maya.

1427
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,100
Yeah,
that's a brilliant idea because you're

1428
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,750
also the first fighter that ever did
that.

1429
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:23,380
Cause many fighters have great stories,
but very few of them we've ever,

1430
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,450
I don't think anybody besides you,
it was ever put into it.

1431
00:57:25,451 --> 00:57:27,910
And we went all over the ct do that man.
It's just amazing.

1432
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,040
We did in Monaco,
we didn't own,

1433
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:31,790
we did it,
um,

1434
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,713
uh,
uh,

1435
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:36,040
amount of various places.
And now my eighth can't believe that

1436
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:37,930
people want to see this though.
Well,

1437
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,700
like I said,
the documentary was amazing.

1438
00:57:39,701 --> 00:57:43,480
So people want to hear the live version
of you talking about it and to see you

1439
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:46,360
live in person.
Cause the first time we did it,

1440
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,800
the first time we did it,
I'm on Broadway dated,

1441
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:51,703
right.
We were really

1442
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,830
sure about how it's gonna turn out.
So we invited all of our friends.

1443
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,320
We had taken the,
gave all to our friends and people we

1444
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:00,940
love like names and we pulled them to
the show.

1445
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:03,630
And so when we started they started
laughing.

1446
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,650
But if I left,
I ran in my right wife,

1447
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:06,520
I ran,
I still got the baby.

1448
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:07,780
What's going on and listening.
Okay.

1449
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,570
Can you I,
I didn't want the show to be a comedy.

1450
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:13,810
It turned out to be a common with hard,
gritty show about a tough guy.

1451
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,580
Right.
I made it through his toughness and he

1452
00:58:15,581 --> 00:58:17,200
just came up on me.
It's talking about myself,

1453
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:18,440
how much his stomach I am,
you know,

1454
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,830
and they loved it.
Well,

1455
00:58:23,831 --> 00:58:26,080
I think that was part of it is cause
like they all,

1456
00:58:26,081 --> 00:58:30,280
everybody knew you were this tough guy,
but they didn't know that you can be so

1457
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:33,220
self deprecating and have so much fun
with it all.

1458
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,200
You know?
That's what people loved it because

1459
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,190
yeah,
they're doing the writing for my,

1460
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,640
my moving and stuff.
I haven't seen it anywhere.

1461
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,000
That's going to be pretty wild.
Who's playing you in a movie?

1462
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:47,350
I don't know various people,
but you know most likely when Jv Brown

1463
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,510
and Jamie,
Jamie Foxx to do it,

1464
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,700
he could do it.
He can do anything.

1465
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:53,120
He could do anything,
anything.

1466
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,360
That guy could be the fucking president
of United States.

1467
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:57,760
He could be a pilot that goes to the
moon.

1468
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:59,710
He could do whatever the fuck you want.
I want him to do it.

1469
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,270
Yeah.
He could do whatever he wants.

1470
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:04,000
He'll probably bulk up like crazy too to
do it.

1471
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:06,130
It's going to be really,
wow.

1472
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,720
Yeah.
Jamie could pull it off.

1473
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:12,500
Michael Jai white pulled it off.
Michael Jai white and do it like Jamie.

1474
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,050
I Dunno.
I thought it didn't do a bag.

1475
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,340
A lot of people didn't like what he did,
but I thought he did a good job.

1476
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,270
You did a good job.
He,

1477
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:21,010
I loved him and spawn.
He's a great guy.

1478
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:22,100
Do you know him well?
No.

1479
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,480
He's a great guy.
Great Guy.

1480
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:25,310
Very smart guy.
Very humble guy.

1481
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,370
Really,
really intelligent and a great martial

1482
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:29,750
artist too.
Michael Jai White.

1483
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,840
There's a kill Kachin a karate black
belt is bad.

1484
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:35,660
The fight,
the fight in the UFC now when he was

1485
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:36,980
fighting,
there was no ufc around,

1486
00:59:36,981 --> 00:59:39,920
but he did a lot of karate tournaments
and stuff is very good.

1487
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,350
I've watched him train before.
He's legit.

1488
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:44,300
Very legit.
But like I said,

1489
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:45,320
real,
real good guy.

1490
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,401
But yeah,
I agree.

1491
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:47,520
Jamie Foxx,
man.

1492
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:52,190
Jamie Foxx is on another planet.
He's just got this level of competence

1493
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:57,191
and skill and artistry in his singing
and his comedy and his acting.

1494
00:59:57,591 --> 00:59:59,570
He could do anything.
He could play you.

1495
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,580
He's going to hang out with you for
awhile.

1496
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,290
I don't know what he's,
it's gotta.

1497
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:07,520
It's gotta hang out with you
food pretty often.

1498
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,920
He's got to hang out with you got to
absorb it,

1499
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,220
right?
Yeah.

1500
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,470
To see what,
how that without,

1501
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,120
are you going to be good kids
consultant?

1502
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:15,830
You're going to be like pitch.
I would have never said that.

1503
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,600
I would like to say that.
Yeah.

1504
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:25,100
But for some reason they get them.
They have the Hollywood wave of doing

1505
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:26,150
thing.
Yeah.

1506
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,670
You know what I mean?
They make it come out of Hollywood ish

1507
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:29,603
gift.
Yeah.

1508
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:31,880
Cause some thing that I'm,
it's this,

1509
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:35,380
this is really wild.
How did they tried to switch it to

1510
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:36,530
appear?
Um,

1511
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,150
cause Annabelle,
right?

1512
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,760
Yeah.
They tried to change the story and no

1513
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:43,790
one else I realized too when Hollywood
perspective from things,

1514
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:46,790
the religious is just still
unbelievable.

1515
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,050
Yeah.
So yeah.

1516
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,450
So there really is unbelievable.
Yeah.

1517
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:52,850
Well do you know that movie Fox Catcher?
Did you know that movie?

1518
01:00:52,851 --> 01:00:55,820
They had a roughly movie,
I remember that story of the young guy.

1519
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:57,020
I remember that.
Yeah.

1520
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:01,220
That Guy Mark Schultz.
It was Dave Schultz in March lesson.

1521
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,760
Dave Schultz who got murdered.
Mark Schultz is the guy who fought in

1522
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:06,950
the UFC.
Here's what's crazy about that movie.

1523
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,870
I don't know how much of that movie's
accurate.

1524
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,850
I don't know.
I wasn't there,

1525
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:14,510
but what I do know is the one thing that
I for sure know happened,

1526
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:19,040
they changed when he fought in the UFC.
Mark only fought in UFC wants.

1527
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:21,080
He fought a guy named big daddy
goodrich.

1528
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,160
Gary big,
big black guy were karate,

1529
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:27,710
gi and then eventually got rid of the
gay later in his career,

1530
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:29,300
but he's a legend.
Big Daddy's.

1531
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,390
Imagine you didn't have it in the movie.
It's not big daddy and the movie's

1532
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:34,850
fighting some white guy.
It doesn't make any sense.

1533
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,940
They just,
they changed who he's fighting for.

1534
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:39,560
No reason.
It's a historical event.

1535
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,050
It's like if you,
for whatever reason,

1536
01:01:42,051 --> 01:01:45,860
they decided to not have you fight
Trevor Berbick you fought someone else

1537
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:47,300
like you fought Gerry Cooney for the
title.

1538
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:48,640
It's not going to be crazy.
They were like,

1539
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,810
why would you change history?
Like I hope they don't do nothing.

1540
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:52,130
I'm not going to win.
I can't want to do that.

1541
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:54,050
They do something like that.
That has to be,

1542
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:57,620
they did it with the UFC and when they
did it with foxcatcher can be by,

1543
01:01:57,621 --> 01:01:59,630
but it doesn't make it any better.
That's what's crazy.

1544
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,270
It doesn't make the movie any better to
have him fight a Russian guy.

1545
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:06,960
It doesn't make him a bed.
If I could be known right in the UFC,

1546
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:09,640
especially for people like me that are
in the audience and go,

1547
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,760
oh look,
look who's playing big daddy high.

1548
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,990
They do a big daddy,
big daddy.

1549
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,160
He's tough.
He took big daddy down at where they do

1550
01:02:16,161 --> 01:02:20,430
whatever you want it to him.
He's Mark Schultz who was a fucker of a

1551
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:23,280
wrestler.
I mean him and his brother was savages.

1552
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,010
They were savages.
They were just made out a down

1553
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:28,730
the deal with they guy.
How did they hook up with that guy?

1554
01:02:28,731 --> 01:02:30,320
What did,
he was really daily

1555
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,830
rich and there's no money in amateur
wrestling and these guys,

1556
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:36,380
a lot of them were really struggling
when they're trying to make the Olympics

1557
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:37,201
team,
I mean they're,

1558
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:39,530
they're getting by barely.
They barely have enough money for

1559
01:02:39,531 --> 01:02:42,530
healthy food and they need sponsors and
sometimes it gets sponsors,

1560
01:02:42,531 --> 01:02:45,190
like a rich guy who owns a business or
you know,

1561
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,790
he loves the Olympics,
he loves wrestling.

1562
01:02:46,791 --> 01:02:49,460
Maybe he wrestled in college and he'll
take care of them.

1563
01:02:49,461 --> 01:02:52,630
Get maybe get them some vitamins,
maybe sponsoring with the Indian,

1564
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,410
you know,
they have various people that help them

1565
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:57,140
with their training and their food.
But this guy came along and said,

1566
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,150
look,
I'm going to build a gigantic facility

1567
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:03,680
to create the best wrestling program and
pay you guys all money to come and train

1568
01:03:03,681 --> 01:03:04,910
here.
And they couldn't help it.

1569
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,100
It's like they were poor.
They didn't know what to do,

1570
01:03:07,101 --> 01:03:08,060
but I understand that.

1571
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,250
Yeah.
And he was a guy who is like a trust

1572
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:12,560
fund guy.
He got all his money from his family and

1573
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:16,190
he was just some crazy rich asshole and
he wound up shooting one of them.

1574
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,400
Yeah,
I mean that's what it is.

1575
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:20,570
I mean,
the store,

1576
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,940
like you said,
the story itself is fucking crazy

1577
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:24,170
enough.
The actual store,

1578
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,640
they didn't have to change anything of
it.

1579
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,570
So I know they changed that part of it.
So who knows what else in the movie the

1580
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:33,320
added or changed or fucked with.
They fucked with something they didn't

1581
01:03:33,321 --> 01:03:35,810
have to fuck with.
They went Hollywood with it in a way

1582
01:03:35,811 --> 01:03:38,130
that they didn't have to do.
So it makes you,

1583
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:42,160
you question all the other things that
happened in the movie and it's pretty,

1584
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,200
so for you they can't,
you can't do that.

1585
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:46,820
Your life was crazy

1586
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:49,010
in thing.
I'm no way I was saying I'm with,

1587
01:03:49,011 --> 01:03:49,670
okay,
I really,

1588
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:51,320
I really want to do this stuff,
man.

1589
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:54,290
I really want to go on the screen with
my life and be fulfilled.

1590
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,600
These people,
I think that really need that.

1591
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,070
I,
you know,

1592
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,330
I'm thinking about that recently.
They're really neat though and um,

1593
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,350
candidate has been,
this is getting ready to pop off and do

1594
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:04,380
really well.
I'm thinking,

1595
01:04:04,381 --> 01:04:05,450
I really,
I don't really,

1596
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:08,150
they're really needs this money that
hurt you.

1597
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,870
It's not going to hurt you.
It's going to help you.

1598
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,230
Anything helps you at this point.
You're so honest that anything that

1599
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:16,020
you've done in the past that you're
embarrassed about or shameful of,

1600
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,240
it just makes,
it's just better.

1601
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:21,270
It's just better for you.
It's like you made mistakes is people

1602
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:22,950
can learn from them.
These are beneficial.

1603
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:26,580
So watching someone like you talk about
your life is beneficial for people

1604
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:30,300
because you learn how you can overcome
these experiences.

1605
01:04:30,301 --> 01:04:32,520
How,
how bad things can be for you.

1606
01:04:32,521 --> 01:04:36,360
You learn how bad you can fuck up and
people need to see shit like that.

1607
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,820
It's good for,
it's good for civilizations,

1608
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:43,650
good for our culture.
I think so at plastic guy like you who

1609
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:47,760
was like I said when I was a kid,
you're the fucking man.

1610
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:53,090
I mean you were the fucking man to have
a guy like you be self deprecating

1611
01:04:53,551 --> 01:04:55,080
explaining and laughing about things.

1612
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,150
It makes it even,
it sinks in more.

1613
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:00,180
It's like you were saying,
we were saying about custom model that

1614
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:04,410
his wisdom,
it's sunk in like he was the gravel in

1615
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:08,160
his voice and the intensity in his eyes
and the wisdom in his words,

1616
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:12,360
it's sunk in.
I remembered his quotes for years

1617
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,270
afterwards because he lived so much
because he had so much,

1618
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,010
and that's the same thing with you man.
When you,

1619
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,090
when you were talking about your life
experiences,

1620
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:22,150
like people listen,
they take it in because they know you

1621
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:26,440
lived an extraordinary life,
so they better not fuck this movie out

1622
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:29,140
and it really extreme.
It's extreme as it gets.

1623
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:34,990
What's Mark Stream other than a soldier
and those are the only people that live

1624
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:37,420
a more extreme life first responder
soldiers,

1625
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:39,070
firemen,
police officers.

1626
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,403
Yeah.
That's it.

1627
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,430
I mean they,
they're seeing death and violence every

1628
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,263
day.
Other than them.

1629
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:45,460
You probably lived the most extreme life
ever.

1630
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,050
Who the fuck can relate to you?
Do you ever get together with other like

1631
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,920
worldclass pro boxers that have

1632
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:53,620
no,
but the guy that do get it and took it,

1633
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:55,090
the guy who talked about the veteran,
the,

1634
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:57,400
yeah.
Maybe telling me with the,

1635
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,400
you know,
oh man.

1636
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,140
Yeah.
Talked to seals about their time

1637
01:06:00,141 --> 01:06:02,300
deployed,
so probably they don't take themselves

1638
01:06:02,301 --> 01:06:03,530
out of that.
Those guys.

1639
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,150
Yeah.
Thanks.

1640
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:09,920
Well a lot of those guys are finding
some relief in the same things that you

1641
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:10,420
found it.

1642
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,450
Family farm or leave and,
and DMT and other psychedelics,

1643
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:15,640
mushrooms.
I think that that could be a great

1644
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:17,290
benefit to a lot of our veterans.

1645
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,680
I believe that 100% too.
I don't know why they don't want to

1646
01:06:20,681 --> 01:06:22,270
dabble in this stuff.
Yeah.

1647
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,240
What do you think would have happened to
you if you got ahold of that stuff?

1648
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:28,270
While you were in your prime.
I don't know.

1649
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:30,160
I don't think maybe I want to be a
fighter then.

1650
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,560
Yeah.
Maybe I won't want to be a fighter.

1651
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,710
Damn.
D tmt might have derailed it.

1652
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:39,080
Yeah.
I might want to love everybody.

1653
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,310
Definitely make you feel it when you
come out of it.

1654
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:43,660
You got love for you.
Yeah,

1655
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:46,080
buddy.
Yeah.

1656
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,260
Well

1657
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:51,010
my hope is that uh,
with great organizations like maps,

1658
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,910
um,
that one day people will be able to see

1659
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:58,360
things like everybody would be able to
see things the way you do and then we'll

1660
01:06:58,361 --> 01:07:00,310
all have this understanding what these
things are there.

1661
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:03,940
They're tools that can help us all these
things including marijuana.

1662
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:08,110
It's a tool to help us.
You going to use any tool you can abuse.

1663
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:10,210
Any tool there is,
you can take a hammer and hit yourself

1664
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:11,230
in the head.
If you're stupid,

1665
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:14,510
you could abuse anything,
but you could also use it in a,

1666
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,540
in a make,
build yourself a beautiful house.

1667
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:20,380
And with cannabis you can,
you could use it to make it makes you a

1668
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:22,330
nicer version.
Does makes you more,

1669
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:25,510
I've felt more vulnerable.
Have more of a sense of community.

1670
01:07:25,511 --> 01:07:27,850
I'm always hugging people when I'm high.
I want to hug everybody.

1671
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:29,340
You know,
I agree.

1672
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,460
It's a better feeling.
You know what I mean?

1673
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:34,310
It makes you,
it makes you feel kind.

1674
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,500
I agree.
I like feeling.

1675
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:38,450
Okay.
What is it like for you to,

1676
01:07:38,451 --> 01:07:40,100
uh,
to watch boxing these days?

1677
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:44,060
Isn't that in my life anymore?
You don't watch it at all?

1678
01:07:44,061 --> 01:07:45,910
It did you watch Tyson fury?
Deontay wilder.

1679
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,570
I was in the air flying when they were
fighting.

1680
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,250
Oh really?
Did you didn't watch it?

1681
01:07:51,251 --> 01:07:53,080
The highlights or anything for some of
the highlights?

1682
01:07:53,081 --> 01:07:55,200
Yeah.
How crazy is deontay?

1683
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:57,220
Wilder is power.
Good stuff.

1684
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,200
Crazy rights.
Cause he's built so strange.

1685
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:02,260
It's totally how incredible.
How incredible of titans.

1686
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,640
Chore.
Incredible.

1687
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:06,310
Incredible.
And gets up and wins the rest of the

1688
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:07,900
round.
That's what's really incredible.

1689
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,270
It's amazing.
Amazing fight.

1690
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:11,740
Yeah.
So you don't follow,

1691
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:14,030
you don't follow any of the tail with,
um,

1692
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,070
you know,
that's part of my life.

1693
01:08:16,071 --> 01:08:16,881
Um,
I'm,

1694
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:20,360
um,
I've got mixed feelings with that part

1695
01:08:20,361 --> 01:08:21,680
of my life.
Right.

1696
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,210
And I stuffed up there.
I don't like about myself and stuff.

1697
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:28,850
That is right.
I tried to forget that stuff cause I'm

1698
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:30,400
on a whole different.
Um,

1699
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,000
if I hadn't.
Yeah.

1700
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:34,670
So even watching other people by,

1701
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,430
I don't even what to,
nothing.

1702
01:08:36,431 --> 01:08:38,440
I tried to stay away much as possible.

1703
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,220
So watching other people box makes you
think about yourself when you were

1704
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:43,550
fighting reminds you of it kind of.
Yeah.

1705
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:45,200
Yeah.
I would say these guys are so much

1706
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:47,290
Nathan and I was,
you know what I mean?

1707
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:50,970
I'd be the cool guy.
Yeah.

1708
01:08:50,971 --> 01:08:52,360
Right.
Like who,

1709
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:53,250
who,
yeah.

1710
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:55,980
There's no one out here today that's got
that mean,

1711
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:58,410
vicious persona and Nice Guy.
Yeah.

1712
01:08:58,411 --> 01:09:00,660
You,
when you were in the ring doing a post

1713
01:09:00,661 --> 01:09:03,060
fight interview saying you want to eat
your children,

1714
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:05,610
you want to eat someone's children.
I remember saying that.

1715
01:09:05,611 --> 01:09:07,890
This is the craziest fucking post fight
interview.

1716
01:09:07,891 --> 01:09:09,060
It was.
It was about Lennox Lewis,

1717
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:09,391
right?
Yeah.

1718
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:11,010
If I'm mad,
maybe one of the great,

1719
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,620
what's wrong with me?
I'm just a madman.

1720
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:16,250
It was amazing.
It was amazing for,

1721
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:17,880
for the story,
for the time.

1722
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,630
I mean,
look what it was was when we saw rocky

1723
01:09:21,631 --> 01:09:22,740
three,
right.

1724
01:09:22,770 --> 01:09:25,260
And Mr t was,
it was challenging,

1725
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,840
you know,
a rocky and he would say all that crazy

1726
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:30,310
shit about what he was going to do.
My prediction pain.

1727
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:31,021
No.
Beautiful.

1728
01:09:31,021 --> 01:09:33,570
It's beautiful.
What you did is you took that and just

1729
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:37,020
cranked it up to 11 and threw gasoline
on it and lit it on fire.

1730
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:39,690
You just took that kind of ferocious
shit.

1731
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:42,270
Yeah.
I look at some of those prep conference

1732
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:43,170
in a long time.
I'm what?

1733
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,280
I'm faintly talk to anybody like that.

1734
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:48,310
That's a different world now.
My world feels different now.

1735
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:52,990
Do you feel when you watched that stuff
that you feel almost like trapped by

1736
01:09:52,991 --> 01:09:55,690
that past like that you have to
acknowledge it.

1737
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:56,980
You don't even acknowledge it anymore.

1738
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:57,740
Yeah.
For that,

1739
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,670
I'm almost a little bit like,
I don't want to be involved.

1740
01:09:59,671 --> 01:10:00,660
We stayed.
Never happened.

1741
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:01,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1742
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:04,890
But kind of had to happen for you to be
who you are.

1743
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,920
They'll know it because people,
this is the real reason that [inaudible]

1744
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,470
people,
stihl people left that guy.

1745
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:11,141
Yeah.
Yeah.

1746
01:10:11,141 --> 01:10:13,530
And then people would love that.
I didn't like that guy that much.

1747
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:17,280
So I have my own conflicting with people
that like that guy and me living my life

1748
01:10:17,281 --> 01:10:19,020
that I am living now.
Yeah.

1749
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:23,150
Well people love that guy because that
guy gave them a drug and that drug was

1750
01:10:23,151 --> 01:10:25,940
excitement.
Like you turn on the TV like,

1751
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:27,050
Oh shit,
here we go,

1752
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:28,430
Michael Spanx,
Mike Tyson.

1753
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:29,810
Here we go.
And boom.

1754
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:32,090
Oh,
that's what people wanted.

1755
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:34,730
They wanted that excitement.
They knew some crazy shit was about to

1756
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,290
go down.
Unpredictable.

1757
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,251
You can't,
you don't.

1758
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:38,600
No one knows it's going to happen at a
fight.

1759
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:41,030
Is it going to be a right or a left?
Is he going to move right is you're

1760
01:10:41,031 --> 01:10:42,620
gonna move left.
How's it going to work out?

1761
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,600
You don't know how long could spank
slas.

1762
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:47,510
You don't know.
And everybody was excited and that was,

1763
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,910
that's what you brought people.
You brought people this,

1764
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:52,910
this chaotic moment.
You slapped down the money and the paper

1765
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,200
views.
You've got at your popcorn and you

1766
01:10:54,201 --> 01:10:58,010
waited for the dirt rush.
The rush of excitement of the crazy

1767
01:10:58,010 --> 01:10:58,940
days.
Crazy days.

1768
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,653
Okay then.

1769
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,830
I hate to keep bringing your head back
to that,

1770
01:11:03,831 --> 01:11:08,360
but just for me as a kid growing up
during that time,

1771
01:11:08,361 --> 01:11:10,070
it was a big part of my,
you know,

1772
01:11:10,071 --> 01:11:13,680
my becoming an adult.
It was during your era,

1773
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:14,190
you're

1774
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,890
ever of dominance.
How we'd look at my kids and I think,

1775
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:17,660
why did you guys,
uh,

1776
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:19,400
pretty much,
um,

1777
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:23,400
um,
middle class kid,

1778
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:25,890
they live their life to do what they
wanted to go to college and everything.

1779
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,600
I W I w I would never want to put that
pressure on my son.

1780
01:11:28,601 --> 01:11:30,840
That you have to be the total best.
You have to dominate everybody.

1781
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:32,310
You're going to be the best that ever
live at this.

1782
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,820
He's put that kind of pressure on him.
That's incredible.

1783
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:36,450
Would never do that to them.
Yeah.

1784
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,670
It would never work.
Probably.

1785
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,440
I mean,
I don't think a kid that grows up in a

1786
01:11:40,441 --> 01:11:45,441
loving household would supportive boxing
for when you have nothing to boxing.

1787
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,470
When you did it had nothing.
Cause that's a lot of,

1788
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,430
um,
a lot of dedication.

1789
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,640
It's a lot of pain.
That's a lot of aggravation.

1790
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:54,474
Louder.
You know what I mean?

1791
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,351
Really?
Yes.

1792
01:11:55,351 --> 01:11:58,710
I'm discovering who you are,
but you must be able to take pride in

1793
01:11:58,711 --> 01:12:00,570
the fact that your children don't ever
have to do that.

1794
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:02,250
Oh,
and that's why I took the punches for,

1795
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:06,390
they wouldn't have to do now.
I had my first might have to send a 16.

1796
01:12:06,391 --> 01:12:07,010
He wanted to be

1797
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:09,080
box of it.
I saw you working with

1798
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:19,160
private school boxing,
[inaudible] European trips.

1799
01:12:21,661 --> 01:12:25,230
He did trips and us to vacation.
You have to be a fight and kid how to

1800
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:30,231
hear the joke.
And he's really soon.

1801
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:32,840
I think he's serious,
man.

1802
01:12:32,870 --> 01:12:35,330
I know a nobody.
He lived to good fight.

1803
01:12:35,331 --> 01:12:39,290
Some guy like me from animal can't know
when my kids go through that crap.

1804
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,050
That's the degrading from guy like that

1805
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:43,660
beating on you.
Yeah.

1806
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:47,440
That's the thing is the fuel that you
had,

1807
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:50,470
the,
the burning and ferno inside you,

1808
01:12:50,471 --> 01:12:52,630
you can't replicate that.
They don't understand that.

1809
01:12:52,631 --> 01:12:53,610
They don't,
I don't know.

1810
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:54,550
You know,
a lot of stuff.

1811
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,160
Um,
in spite shaming inspires a lot of

1812
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:58,840
success.
Yeah.

1813
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,240
You know,
they don't have to deal with that kind

1814
01:13:01,241 --> 01:13:02,090
of shame.
Right,

1815
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,850
right.
Shame,

1816
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,200
pain.
Exactly.

1817
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:08,050
Feeling of being left out,
feeling of not belonging,

1818
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,760
and you gotta write to this.
I'm going to be,

1819
01:13:09,890 --> 01:13:12,440
everybody's going to love me.
Crazy feeling.

1820
01:13:12,441 --> 01:13:14,920
It's Felix mentioned to get people
because you wouldn't be accepted so

1821
01:13:14,921 --> 01:13:16,360
badly.
Yeah.

1822
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,410
Imagine that it fully accepted people
that look at you,

1823
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,800
you know and know what kind of mindset
of that,

1824
01:13:22,801 --> 01:13:24,670
that that either want people to just
look at you.

1825
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,680
Yeah,
you're a sick fuck.

1826
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:31,500
Want me to look at me?
Look,

1827
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,140
oh mom,
man.

1828
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,460
Yeah,
but it's beautiful that you could

1829
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:37,980
describe it that way now.
Like you've stepped outside of it long

1830
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,960
enough.
Do you recognize what it was when it was

1831
01:13:39,961 --> 01:13:42,060
overcoming that?
I used to be stories.

1832
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:44,460
Alexander the great had this guy was a
god.

1833
01:13:44,610 --> 01:13:45,660
Wow,

1834
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,820
I want to be like that.
You know?

1835
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:51,130
This is crazy.
It's just crazy that you can inspire

1836
01:13:51,131 --> 01:13:51,570
them,

1837
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:55,710
that you're more than what you are.
What was also those feelings of

1838
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:58,230
conquering?
We're giving you the first success in

1839
01:13:58,231 --> 01:14:01,410
good feelings of your life and the fact
that they programmed you.

1840
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:03,030
I mean,
that's something that I don't think a

1841
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:04,500
lot of people are aware of.
The,

1842
01:14:04,501 --> 01:14:08,190
the,
the hypnotism to hypnotism and the

1843
01:14:08,220 --> 01:14:12,010
putting those thoughts into your mind,
which were hugely beneficial that you

1844
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:15,490
could tap into that mind zone right
before you competed and they may need,

1845
01:14:15,491 --> 01:14:19,150
they gave you a clear path.
They give you a clear path to use your

1846
01:14:19,151 --> 01:14:24,151
fury with this like very analytical
approach with perfect boxing technique

1847
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:27,520
and an amazing mentor with incredible
amount of knowledge.

1848
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:30,100
And they just let you loose to the
ethic.

1849
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,860
Have to do the math.
Yeah.

1850
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,510
Bad intention.
Yeah.

1851
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,340
Being bad intention and having through
the,

1852
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,740
and when you're fighting and loving
every minute of it.

1853
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:40,520
Yeah.
Look at you.

1854
01:14:40,521 --> 01:14:41,354
You getting fired up again.

1855
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:45,940
Do you work out anymore?
Nah,

1856
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,710
man.
Keep away from that stuff and they don't

1857
01:14:47,711 --> 01:14:49,120
even like a,
all that stuff,

1858
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:50,500
you know,
spin class or anything.

1859
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:51,311
No.
All that stuff.

1860
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:54,160
Um,
and reactivate to my ego.

1861
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:55,600
Oh really?
Yeah.

1862
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,790
Oh Wow.
Don't they get ripped on us today?

1863
01:14:57,810 --> 01:15:01,000
We activate it.
That's the thing about like extreme

1864
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:03,290
winters,
extreme winters that,

1865
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,280
that that ego is hard.
My Ego.

1866
01:15:06,310 --> 01:15:09,850
I'm a lose lose.
I'm losing this candidate.

1867
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:12,400
I'm gonna lose everything.
What have you let go jogging.

1868
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,270
Can you go jogging?
Nah,

1869
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,350
I can't do it.
Do My treadmill working stone treadmill.

1870
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,600
That's it.
But if I thought the thing that I'm

1871
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:20,980
specialist,
I get a glimpse,

1872
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:22,420
a glimmer of that thing for,
hey,

1873
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:23,460
whoa.
Yeah.

1874
01:15:23,461 --> 01:15:25,870
Get you you better than though.
I saw a video.

1875
01:15:25,871 --> 01:15:28,210
You're hitting the back recently.
It was like a couple of years ago,

1876
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,130
you still had the bag.

1877
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,480
He still throw some bombs partly for the
camera.

1878
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,390
Yeah,
that's what you are doing it.

1879
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:35,141
But I'm like,
damn,

1880
01:15:35,141 --> 01:15:37,210
you can still move.
You still have it in you,

1881
01:15:37,211 --> 01:15:38,570
right?
I don't know.

1882
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:40,450
It's in your body.
Have to be,

1883
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:45,180
I don't want nothing to do,
but what I was going to get to when if

1884
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,770
you were standing front of that heavy
bag and you start rattling off

1885
01:15:47,771 --> 01:15:50,170
combinations and people,
you start thinking like,

1886
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,960
Oh shit,
I'm actually Mike Tyson.

1887
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:57,070
Like I was that guy.
I am that guy who went through that.

1888
01:15:57,071 --> 01:15:59,740
I am the youngest heavyweight champion
of all time.

1889
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,810
I am that guy to destroy tyrrell bigs.
I am that guy that knocked out Larry

1890
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,560
Holmes.
I'm that guy,

1891
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,870
looked at my eyes,
can look at that guy.

1892
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:10,420
I look at,
that guy has given me a platform to help

1893
01:16:10,421 --> 01:16:12,580
me forget about that guy.
Wow.

1894
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,210
Yeah.
It's,

1895
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,150
it's beautiful that you have that,
that mindset.

1896
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,480
It is because most people who've
accomplished as much as you have,

1897
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:24,790
they don't want to ever let the past go.
Shit,

1898
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:27,000
let that go,
let it go,

1899
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,320
but do you,
do you recognize that,

1900
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:32,290
that that's a beautiful part of your
personality.

1901
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:35,170
You had one of the most successful
boxing careers ever,

1902
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:37,270
but you don't want it.
You don't want nothing to do with it.

1903
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,520
You didn't want to.
We want to acknowledge it exists.

1904
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:44,700
You wish it went away in order to
arrive to that next chapter in life.

1905
01:16:45,431 --> 01:16:49,660
You have to forget chapter that came
before you and focusing on the chapter

1906
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:50,740
ahead of you.
Yes.

1907
01:16:50,890 --> 01:16:54,010
Yes.
That's a great lesson and from coming

1908
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:56,710
from you,
that lesson I think is going to hit home

1909
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:58,220
with a lot of people think though.
Yes,

1910
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:01,900
a hundred percent a hundred percent
because you accomplished so much because

1911
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:03,910
you were the youngest heavyweight
champion of all time because you're the

1912
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:06,250
baddest man on the planet.
There's big hero for a lot of people

1913
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:09,230
like me.
When I was growing up to see you now say

1914
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,430
that's then

1915
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,360
I'm done.
Oh,

1916
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,160
nothing.
I don't to watch it.

1917
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,660
I don't work out.
I'm not,

1918
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:17,330
I'm not even a part of that anymore.
I'm concentrating them on live right now

1919
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:18,200
and I'm happy and I love it.

1920
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,410
People,
you know Joe,

1921
01:17:19,411 --> 01:17:21,420
that's really crazy,
but when you think about this,

1922
01:17:21,421 --> 01:17:22,201
listen,
you know,

1923
01:17:22,201 --> 01:17:24,720
being that person,
that guy that sent me the psych ward a

1924
01:17:24,721 --> 01:17:26,940
couple of times,
they send me to so many other places to

1925
01:17:26,941 --> 01:17:29,250
prison and they said,
why I send me places.

1926
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:32,510
That guy is a trip.
That's a trick.

1927
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:35,930
I had you in the underwear holding the
tiger on the change the trip.

1928
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:40,470
What did you go to the psych ward for?
It's freaking crazy.

1929
01:17:40,471 --> 01:17:43,990
Violent.
Probably thought about hurting myself or

1930
01:17:43,991 --> 01:17:46,830
something crazy like that.
What do they do when they take you in

1931
01:17:46,831 --> 01:17:48,120
the psych ward?
How do they treat you?

1932
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:49,500
Um,
no,

1933
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,030
he's the same way.
Everybody treat me.

1934
01:17:51,031 --> 01:17:52,150
This is Mike.
No,

1935
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,330
but I mean how do they take care of you?
What did they do for you?

1936
01:17:55,110 --> 01:17:57,430
I mean,
how do they take Mike Tyson common down

1937
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,620
fucking pills.

1938
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:04,310
The something zone you out be like,
cause I'm leaving and found me swag of

1939
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:05,370
it.
Yeah.

1940
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:07,680
Yeah.
That is what they do.

1941
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:08,514
Huh?
Yeah.

1942
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,050
Just call me down medically.
Pharmaceutically instead Zombie like if

1943
01:18:13,051 --> 01:18:14,020
I'm going to look at,
I told him,

1944
01:18:14,021 --> 01:18:16,370
you don't know what's going on.
Well you know what's going on with you

1945
01:18:16,371 --> 01:18:18,270
can react to it.
Jesus.

1946
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:20,940
And then once the got you calmed down
enough to go,

1947
01:18:20,941 --> 01:18:21,774
all right,
you can go.

1948
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:24,300
I don't know.
I don't think I ever get calmed down

1949
01:18:24,301 --> 01:18:26,490
enough.
It was time for me to go and I had to

1950
01:18:26,491 --> 01:18:30,750
go,
what is a day in the life of Mike Tyson

1951
01:18:30,751 --> 01:18:33,180
like now?
And like what does a typical day get up

1952
01:18:33,181 --> 01:18:36,390
in the morning?
I go to my office and my candidate for

1953
01:18:36,391 --> 01:18:40,110
office,
we do deals and we get investments and

1954
01:18:40,111 --> 01:18:42,930
um,
I'd come home at five o'clock and I go

1955
01:18:42,931 --> 01:18:45,690
see my kids to live 50 at the office
later and I come home and I hang out

1956
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:47,970
with my wife and my kids if the,
um,

1957
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:49,560
it really bizarre life.

1958
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,140
We stay in Newport beach now.
Oh that's not really,

1959
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:54,990
um,
it's very scale is very upscale,

1960
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:58,410
but it's very quiet and not like Las
Vegas at all.

1961
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:01,350
No one.
Then my daughter plays tennis up there,

1962
01:19:01,351 --> 01:19:03,670
so we're pretty much,
I'm situated up there.

1963
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:04,290
Not like I said,
baby,

1964
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,640
we can't,
we move to Hollywood.

1965
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:06,810
She didn't know we can't go to beverly
hills.

1966
01:19:06,811 --> 01:19:09,630
No.
Cause the tennis hall of her Tennis

1967
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:11,520
Requirement for here in Newport beach.
So we stay here.

1968
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,770
Newports nice though.
It's a good place.

1969
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,820
It's near the ocean.
It's got clean was here.

1970
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:17,690
It's um,
it's,

1971
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:19,890
it's just different for me.
I bet.

1972
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,040
Yeah.
Did you like living in Vegas though?

1973
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,850
Cause a fight today gets,
it was always crazy and everything.

1974
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:26,910
The fight did bring great parties
though.

1975
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:28,470
You call,
we get some great parties.

1976
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,970
Great.
So you've settled into this business

1977
01:19:32,971 --> 01:19:34,440
life,
it seems like pretty easily.

1978
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,060
Like you,
you seem to be enjoying yourself.

1979
01:19:36,090 --> 01:19:38,100
Hey fender,
I want to do and um,

1980
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,980
if I'm,
if this is a fresh start,

1981
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:43,020
you know what I mean?
I look,

1982
01:19:43,021 --> 01:19:44,430
um,
since doing the total,

1983
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,090
you know what I mean?
My main objective and everything I'd

1984
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,070
been embarking on and being,
um,

1985
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:53,250
involving myself with,
it's all been kind of a fresh start.

1986
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:55,740
I feel fresh,
it feels new and I feel that nothing can

1987
01:19:55,741 --> 01:19:58,590
stop in that and could be in my way and
it's just awesome feeling.

1988
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:03,720
So this is from doing that one dmt
experience just sent you until I did one

1989
01:20:03,721 --> 01:20:04,660
time,
but I did it many,

1990
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,660
many times that,
that right.

1991
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:07,321
You know?
Yeah.

1992
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:08,154
This is really,
um,

1993
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:11,760
I don't know what it is.
I'm trying to figure it out,

1994
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,710
but I've changed.
But you're still figuring out,

1995
01:20:13,711 --> 01:20:16,050
I still know how.
Yeah,

1996
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:20,760
I describe it for a lot of people.
It's like resetting a computer and you

1997
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:23,250
reset a computer.
You have a fresh new desktop and there's

1998
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,590
only one folder on the desktop and that
folder says,

1999
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:26,700
my old bullshit.

2000
01:20:26,970 --> 01:20:30,160
This is Lithonia stop and saying,
do my third way.

2001
01:20:30,161 --> 01:20:33,820
Now sometimes I'm wondering this new
feeling that I'm possessing right now,

2002
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:35,920
if it,
I'm a real feeling this stuff really

2003
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:39,130
help I am I lying to myself again till
the next moment,

2004
01:20:39,131 --> 01:20:42,640
the neck feeling come to do some drills
to be with somebody else and what's

2005
01:20:42,641 --> 01:20:44,740
really going on.
Has that feeling going to come back

2006
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:47,650
there this moment they feel,
feel like it never coming back

2007
01:20:48,240 --> 01:20:50,610
it.
It can never come back if you decide

2008
01:20:50,611 --> 01:20:53,130
that it's never coming back,
but you have to make that decision

2009
01:20:53,131 --> 01:20:55,230
pretty much every day,
but you can,

2010
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,040
you can never come back if you want or
you could slip into the old ways.

2011
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,540
That's what a lot of people do.
One of the,

2012
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:02,820
when a lot of people fall into drug
additions,

2013
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,950
relapsing,
when they relapse,

2014
01:21:04,951 --> 01:21:07,110
they're not physically addicted.
When they're relapsed,

2015
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:09,690
obviously they're clean and then he
decided to go back in.

2016
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:14,160
It's cause there's comfort in those old
patterns because this new way of life is

2017
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,690
just,
they get anxiety.

2018
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,390
They feel like it's a lot of pressure to
stay clean.

2019
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:19,330
Well,
that's explained it.

2020
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,310
I hate that.
I always hated that.

2021
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:22,830
Oh wait,
I never wanted to do,

2022
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:25,090
but then I do him again.
I never wanted,

2023
01:21:25,091 --> 01:21:26,590
I hate a thousand now.
No,

2024
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:31,871
no.
Come on.

2025
01:21:31,871 --> 01:21:33,220
You understand what I'm saying?
No,

2026
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,500
I don't want to fuck.
I don't want that.

2027
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:37,420
And then once you do that and once you
do it,

2028
01:21:37,421 --> 01:21:40,030
then he's going all out.
Now you haven't gone to liquor there.

2029
01:21:40,031 --> 01:21:41,470
The girl,
Oh man,

2030
01:21:41,471 --> 01:21:43,480
this is just a dark,
dark,

2031
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:45,310
vicious cycle.
It's real dark.

2032
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,560
It's self destructive.
It's all about ego inflating and self

2033
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,510
deprecating to stroke.

2034
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:57,860
It also alleviates you from the
responsibility of improving the hundred

2035
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,720
percent that pressure of like keeping it
together,

2036
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:03,240
staying sober,
being disciplined,

2037
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:05,100
all that stuff.
Once it's gone,

2038
01:22:05,101 --> 01:22:06,060
it's gone.
Like Ah,

2039
01:22:06,061 --> 01:22:07,590
I'm just fucking crazy.
I'm crazy.

2040
01:22:07,591 --> 01:22:08,940
This is just what I do.
I'm crazy.

2041
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,970
And it's easy to fall into that trap.
And that's what happens to a lot of

2042
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:13,140
people who relapse with drugs.

2043
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:18,690
I never want to go back to that again.
It's just a no win situation.

2044
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:23,020
That's one of the great things about
marijuana that people don't understand.

2045
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,390
They think that a drug is a drug as a
drug.

2046
01:22:25,391 --> 01:22:27,250
They're all falling under the same
category,

2047
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:32,640
but you can use marijuana and just be
peaceful and not chaotic and the

2048
01:22:33,431 --> 01:22:37,270
opposite of make you think more about
what the consequences of ruining your

2049
01:22:37,271 --> 01:22:38,104
life

2050
01:22:38,970 --> 01:22:41,800
because they sound ridiculous.
I got um,

2051
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:45,750
I got a foot in a way.
Detroit,

2052
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,700
Michigan,
one time a for Andrew Colada.

2053
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:53,510
I got 'em and tested and tested for
marijuana and they charged me 300,000

2054
01:22:55,351 --> 01:23:00,330
hours.
Jesus Christ find me $200,000.

2055
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,040
That's a lot of my,
where'd that money go?

2056
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,110
Who took it?
The commission get,

2057
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,470
yeah,
when did coke with it?

2058
01:23:07,471 --> 01:23:09,010
Yeah.
That's what they did.

2059
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:10,720
Yeah.
That's crazy.

2060
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:15,780
$300,000 for some weed in your system.
Now you're selling it legally.

2061
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:18,730
Yeah.
Miss,

2062
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:21,400
I'm just,
this is just a bizarre situation.

2063
01:23:21,401 --> 01:23:24,040
I'm just going with this bizarre world
and see what happens.

2064
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,211
It's beautiful,
man.

2065
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:27,790
Never thought you could do the sell
marijuana without being in that

2066
01:23:27,791 --> 01:23:29,860
business.
I know at this stage in my life,

2067
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:32,170
when it came at the right particular
time,

2068
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,170
I saw it online.
I saw Tyson ranch online and saw

2069
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,210
something on instagram or something and
I was like,

2070
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:38,044
that makes sense.

2071
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,700
Yeah.
Yeah.

2072
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:40,540
Why not,
man?

2073
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,550
In this day and age,
we look,

2074
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:43,180
everybody loves you.
Why not?

2075
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:45,400
Why not go into business and never
dreamt it?

2076
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:48,100
But it's just a no brainer.
People gonna want to buy your weed just

2077
01:23:48,101 --> 01:23:51,190
because they love you.
I want to distribute all over the world

2078
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:53,170
too.
That's where it gets sketchy.

2079
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,450
Yeah.
There's some spots in Asia.

2080
01:23:55,451 --> 01:23:57,850
You don't want to bring weed to know
Singapore.

2081
01:23:57,851 --> 01:23:58,930
You can get killed.
I,

2082
01:23:58,931 --> 01:23:59,430
oh yeah,
no,

2083
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:01,060
but that's the,
there's some parts of the world that

2084
01:24:01,061 --> 01:24:02,100
the,
if they checked it,

2085
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:04,540
yeah,
like I went to Europe to buy weed

2086
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:05,380
before.
I mean,

2087
01:24:05,381 --> 01:24:07,660
and it with 'em they were throwing in
the plant.

2088
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:09,650
They weren't fell into,
but there was some of the plant you have

2089
