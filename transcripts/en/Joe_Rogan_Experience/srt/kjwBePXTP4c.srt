1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,710
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,830
How'd you get involved in this?

3
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:05,664
You started,

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,870
you said 24 years ago doing
drug research on animals.

5
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:09,440
How did,

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:09,711
what,

7
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,221
what was,

8
00:00:10,221 --> 00:00:11,960
what led you to want to go down this road?

9
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,340
So I was in,

10
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:17,840
I tell the story in the book and so I
was in the air force back in the 80s,

11
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:19,670
like you mentioned about crack cocaine.

12
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:21,560
So I was in the air force over in England,

13
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,340
um,

14
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,420
86,

15
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,171
87,

16
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:29,171
88 and crack cocaine was a big deal
in the United States as you point out.

17
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:34,211
And I grew up in the hood and Miami
and Miami was a cocaine capital in the

18
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:35,511
United States.

19
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:35,830
And,

20
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,280
and so things that were happening
in my community that were not good,

21
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,050
uh,

22
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,280
high unemployment crime,

23
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:44,540
all of these kinds of things,

24
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,310
I blame crack cocaine for that.

25
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,700
And so I thought that if I go to school
and get a degree in order to study

26
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:52,311
drugs,

27
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:53,990
the effects of drugs on the brain,

28
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,820
I could solve the problems that face
my community or problems that I thought

29
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:00,080
were in the community,

30
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,180
particularly those related to drugs.

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,350
And so I began studying drugs as an
undergraduate and then went on to graduate

32
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:11,351
school to study drugs on the brains of
animals and to try to figure out the

33
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:14,750
neuro biological mechanisms that
were responsible for addiction.

34
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,980
So you just got

35
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,460
fascinated by this idea of fixing this,

36
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,940
this issue that you saw in your community
and then you just fell into a rabbit

37
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:23,630
hole.

38
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,021
Yeah.

39
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:26,960
So when I started along my journey,

40
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,561
my path,

41
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:29,810
I actually got an education and you know,

42
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:32,360
so as James Baldwin said,

43
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:32,520
a,

44
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:32,961
you know,

45
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:33,190
the,

46
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,461
the,

47
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:33,980
the,

48
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,420
the paradox of education,

49
00:01:35,421 --> 00:01:38,530
that's precisely it is as one
begins to become educated,

50
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,750
conscious one begins to question.

51
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:43,100
It's the society in which
he's being educated.

52
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:44,360
And that's what happened with me.

53
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,160
And so along the way I discovered things
like the majority of people who use

54
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,600
these drugs are not addicted.

55
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:51,860
That was one thing I discovered.

56
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,610
I discovered that many of the things that
we set about crack about crack cocaine

57
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:57,020
were just simply not true.

58
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,180
Like the cold crack baby myths.

59
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,350
And people said that when W.

60
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:01,370
Dot.

61
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,070
How generation B should
be prepared to have,

62
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,550
uh,

63
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,140
an army of kids who couldn't learn
because of being exposed to crack cocaine.

64
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,000
That just simply wasn't true when all
the data came out beginning in the mid

65
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,960
1990s,

66
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,970
we realized that that simply wasn't true.

67
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:17,870
Uh,

68
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,750
other things that I learned
that just simply wasn't true.

69
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,690
Uh,

70
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:21,980
uh,

71
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,671
things like,

72
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,000
uh,

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,320
one hit of crack cocaine,

74
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,130
you're addicted.

75
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:25,880
Not True.

76
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,250
That crack cocaine was
different from powder cocaine.

77
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,113
Not True.

78
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,820
All of these things I
discovered along the way,

79
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:32,570
but they weren't,

80
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,470
they weren't true.

81
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,910
And not only that,

82
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,610
I discovered that this wasn't new.

83
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:42,611
I went back to the early 19 hundreds
and saw the same sorta hysteria,

84
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,470
mainly race hysteria surrounding
drugs occurred even then.

85
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,180
And so I thought,

86
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:50,510
what's,

87
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,410
what's going on?

88
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,920
And then that helped me to be
more critical about my issue.

89
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,370
Is there a difference in the,

90
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:58,990
the effect of crack cocaine,

91
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,980
physical effect,

92
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,321
and,

93
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:00,670
and,

94
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,350
and cocaine and heroin?

95
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,171
So let's,

96
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:04,150
let's think about crack cocaine,

97
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,570
heroin rather vague about crack
cocaine and powder cocaine.

98
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,130
Let's just think about
the chemical structure.

99
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,940
The only difference between crack cocaine
and powder cocaine is that the powder

100
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:17,480
cocaine has this thing called the
hydrochloride salt attached to it.

101
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,180
That salt prevents it from being smoked.

102
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,850
Now you can dissolve
the powder cocaine and,

103
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,010
and water and then shooting in your arm.

104
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,590
And so you have the effects of cocaine,

105
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,513
uh,

106
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,380
onset of the effects within seconds.

107
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,170
The same is true with crack cocaine.

108
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,530
The effects or onset of a sex
effects are within seconds.

109
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,010
Now the biological activity of cocaine,

110
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,150
it's at the base,

111
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,170
not that,

112
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,180
so that hydrochloride portion on the,

113
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:44,271
uh,

114
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:46,010
on the cocaine powder,

115
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:48,770
on powder cocaine has
no biological activity.

116
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,060
Whereas so,

117
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,240
so that means that crack and
powder are the same drug.

118
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,520
They are exactly the same drug,

119
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:56,420
the same effect,

120
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,320
same drug.

121
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:57,591
Wow.

122
00:03:57,591 --> 00:03:59,630
So it's indistinguishable to the user.

123
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,680
Indistinguishable.

124
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,200
Now why is it that they
prepare it that way?

125
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,350
Like what's the benefit
of preparing it is just

126
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,420
quicker.

127
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,253
A question.

128
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,480
So one of the things that you,

129
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,080
you might recall Richard Pryor
back in the days when he got,

130
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,570
he burnt and he burned
himself with smoking.

131
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,610
So he was freebasing and so he was
removing that hydrochloride portion of the

132
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:21,570
salt off of,

133
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:24,090
off of the cocaine base so
he could actually smoke it.

134
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,580
Now he was using ether,

135
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,760
which is highly flammable
with crack cocaine,

136
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,210
you don't,

137
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,631
now,

138
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:32,190
you no longer need the ether.

139
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:37,110
You just mix it up with baking soda and
water and the cocaine and you mix it up

140
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,520
and you get rid of that salt.

141
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:41,850
So eat there is no longer need
it and is not as dangerous.

142
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:45,960
So that's one of the reasons that we
have crack cocaine as a result of that.

143
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,520
And it also,

144
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,070
it made it so you could sell them in,

145
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:53,100
in unit doses to make the
drug appear to be cheaper.

146
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:56,130
Because you also might
recall in early 1980s,

147
00:04:56,131 --> 00:04:57,120
1970s,

148
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,960
you had to buy cocaine powder and
bulk and that made it more expensive.

149
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,050
Crack cocaine made it a lot more simple,

150
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,870
simple for people to
buy it who didn't have,

151
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,350
uh,

152
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,071
the kind of,

153
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:08,520
uh,

154
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,060
uh,

155
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,280
expendable income that was
required before the mid 1980.

156
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,050
So essentially they just brought
it down to bite sized portions.

157
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,913
That's right.

158
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,401
Exactly.

159
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:17,550
What,

160
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,400
rather than selling this
whole six pack or 12 pack,

161
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,530
now you can sell one item,

162
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,850
one can have one bottle.

163
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,920
I want to talk more about this,

164
00:05:24,921 --> 00:05:28,610
but I should just clarify that Richard
Pryor changed his story as he got older

165
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,530
and actually said that
he tried to kill himself.

166
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:31,850
He lit himself on fire.

167
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:32,684
Apparently.

168
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,290
Um,

169
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,770
I'm a huge Richard Pryor fan and I know
that that was originally what he had

170
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:36,981
said,

171
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:40,250
that he got burnt doing freebase but
I think he changed his story later.

172
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,390
Um,

173
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,170
I actually worked with them a bunch
of times right before he died.

174
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,490
It was a real honor.

175
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,430
He's a real special dude as
far as standup comedians go.

176
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:49,791
Yeah.

177
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,200
Which you but that,

178
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,180
that um,

179
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:52,940
uh,

180
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,830
style of like free base was a thing that
we know is associated with people that

181
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,641
were really,

182
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,660
really fucked up.

183
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,080
Yeah.

184
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,370
Like the guys doing coke.

185
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,671
Oh,

186
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,031
well,

187
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:02,271
you know,

188
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,470
he's probably gonna mess up his life.

189
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,580
He's freebasing.

190
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,690
Oh Shit.

191
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,020
Yeah,

192
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,621
he's gone,

193
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:06,861
man.

194
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:08,390
He's based and he's a bass had.

195
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,840
Yup.

196
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,171
Right.

197
00:06:09,171 --> 00:06:11,510
Base head was the thing
before crack was bass heads.

198
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,260
Absolutely.

199
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,630
I described a couple of people in the
book from my neighborhood who got into

200
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,670
freebase thing and exactly the
same way you just talked about,

201
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,270
right?

202
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,103
Absolutely.

203
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,680
Um,

204
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,680
now everybody has this idea in their
head that crime and that everything

205
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,340
escalated and the world changed
when crack was introduced.

206
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,330
Is that a myth as well?

207
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,081
Yeah,

208
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,914
it's the myth that,

209
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,740
well,

210
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,370
let me clarify it because on the one hand,

211
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,900
so when crack hit the market,

212
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,280
it was first sort of,

213
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,120
uh,

214
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,430
talked about December,

215
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,181
1984 and the La Times,

216
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:45,710
the first time we heard a crack,

217
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,980
but it didn't become more widely known
or available until maybe the mid 19,

218
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,760
may of 1985.

219
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,360
Now once crack cocaine hit the markets,

220
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,380
what happened was that people were
fighting over various new markets and

221
00:07:00,381 --> 00:07:02,270
whenever there are new illicit markets,

222
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:02,451
yeah,

223
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:06,410
you're going to get some violent
activity until the market settles down.

224
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:09,710
That happened with any illicit market
and that's certainly happened with crack

225
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,544
cocaine.

226
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,240
Now,

227
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,740
one of the things that people,

228
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,280
there are a number of things that people
attribute to try to crack in terms of

229
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:19,940
crime and all of the sort of
downfall of certain communities.

230
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,531
Unemployment.

231
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:25,700
They said that unemployment really
rose as a result of crack cocaine being

232
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:30,701
around now 1982 the unemployment rate
in this country was about 11% of white

233
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,760
folks and it was double
that for black people.

234
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,530
That was before crack,

235
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,730
at least two,

236
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:39,770
three years before crack
even hit the market.

237
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,140
Now doing the whole crack era,

238
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,580
unemployment has never been as
high as 1982 that's number one.

239
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,590
People said things like,

240
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,130
uh,

241
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,130
people from my community did crack
cocaine was responsible for these mothers.

242
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:59,000
These grandmothers now
raising new generations of
kids because their daughters

243
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,360
were strung out on crack and so now
they have to take care of these kids.

244
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,430
That simply wasn't true.

245
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,540
It's certainly happened in,

246
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,380
in my community,

247
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:09,650
but it happened before crack
cocaine was ever on the market.

248
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,490
Certainly happened in my family long
before crack cocaine ever hit the market.

249
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,620
When we look at other communities,

250
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,300
like particularly immigrant community,

251
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,460
if you look at the Jewish community,

252
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:22,100
when they came over to
eastern European Jews,

253
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,420
when they came over in the country,

254
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,900
the early 1,908 or 18
hundreds and so forth,

255
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,591
uh,

256
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:31,370
what you see is that you had a seamless
sort of phenomenon going on and those

257
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,420
kind of communities,

258
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,080
what's his name,

259
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,411
urban,

260
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:34,244
how,

261
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:34,940
uh,

262
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,160
his great book land of our fathers,

263
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:38,390
a home of our fathers,

264
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,470
he kind of described all of
these pathological behaviors
that happened in that

265
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:43,304
community.

266
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,420
Many of those same behaviors
were attributed to crack
cocaine and black people

267
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:48,254
later,

268
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,250
but it's not it,

269
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,710
they were there long before
crack cocaine was there,

270
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,200
but crack cocaine became the scapegoat.

271
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,490
That's a fascinating scapegoat

272
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,960
because I bought into it hook,

273
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:58,621
line and sinker.

274
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,000
I really thought that there
was a difference between
the 1980s in the 1990s as

275
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,470
far as like when crack was introduced,

276
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:04,951
boom,

277
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,640
it took off.

278
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,750
It was sort of something that was just
always discussed as like common facts.

279
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,371
Yeah,

280
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:10,600
no,

281
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,530
I bought into a too and that's what
drove me to pursue my education.

282
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:15,420
And the way I did.

283
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,860
But as a result of
pursuing that education,

284
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,770
I discovered that it was not true.

285
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,140
So are these cultural myths the result
of a politician like political campaigns,

286
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:30,260
we're trying to clean up the streets
and they attributed to certain issues,

287
00:09:30,261 --> 00:09:31,094
or is it,

288
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,050
is it something more widespread?

289
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:35,930
Is it the media just to we're
running with a narrative.

290
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,711
What is it?

291
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:37,341
How'd it get started?

292
00:09:37,341 --> 00:09:37,600
Well,

293
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,810
there were multiple sort of of
factors and players involved.

294
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:42,250
So when we think about the politicians,

295
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,084
for example,

296
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,320
politicians,

297
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,150
if crack cocaine is the problem,

298
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,070
nevermind the fact that unemployment
rate was out of control before crack

299
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:51,970
cocaine hit the mark,

300
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,073
hit the market,

301
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,000
unemployment was out of control.

302
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:58,000
A number of things were already uh,

303
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,893
problematic.

304
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,150
Now you have crack cocaine.

305
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,870
If you blame crack cocaine,

306
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,440
it's really easy to simply say,

307
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,210
we'll put more law enforcement,

308
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,111
we'll hire more.

309
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:11,280
Cops will put more efforts
in controlling drugs.

310
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,850
A lot easier to say,

311
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,550
we'll lock people up
for selling these drugs,

312
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:16,870
for using these drugs.

313
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,310
In the process.

314
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:22,270
What you do is you create jobs for a
select group of people and then you don't

315
00:10:22,271 --> 00:10:24,340
have to deal with the real issues,

316
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,350
the real issues of unemployment,

317
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,790
of deprivation.

318
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,380
All of these things you
don't have to deal with.

319
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,340
There are far more complicated and
so politicians are happy to buy in.

320
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,061
Now,

321
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:38,140
one of the things about crack cocaine
is that when we think about the law that

322
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:42,070
punishes or punish crack cocaine a
hundred times more harshly than powder

323
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:42,904
cocaine,

324
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,510
and the vast majority of people who got
punished under these laws were black.

325
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:46,961
80,

326
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:48,250
85% of the people,

327
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,740
even though they don't make
up the majority of the users.

328
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,600
So people will say things like,

329
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:52,841
well,

330
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:57,010
where those laws racist and the laws
themselves weren't racist because the

331
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,780
congressional black caucus,

332
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,690
17 of the 21 members voted to uh,

333
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,790
for these laws,

334
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:07,390
for these laws that punish crack
cocaine a hundred times more harshly.

335
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,470
But the point is,

336
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,570
is that everyone bought into it.

337
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,060
Parents bought into it
because the parents,

338
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:13,871
for the parents,

339
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:18,100
what this meant is that you don't actually
have to educate your kids about this.

340
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,590
You just say that they're
bad and stay away from it.

341
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,090
No education required.

342
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,020
Um,

343
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,390
even sciences and treatment providers,

344
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,970
they all bought into it
because you got a problem,

345
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
we're going to solve your problem.

346
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:31,760
So we are needed and we are valued all.

347
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,730
So you had all of these
sort of constituencies from
society benefiting from the

348
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:39,490
vilification or to escape
goating of crack cocaine.

349
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,600
All of those things think came together
nicely and then we think about the

350
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,434
wrappers.

351
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,490
They all came into the game too
because it's like unconscious.

352
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm going to say that this is a problem
in my community and I care about my,

353
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,180
and this is the way that I can show it.

354
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,270
So everybody had a stake in this sort of.

355
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,940
Okay.

356
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,450
Wow.

357
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,400
That is absolutely fascinating.

358
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,743
You know,

359
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,010
one of the things that I've,

360
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,160
I've talked to quite a few
people about when it comes to,

361
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:07,880
uh,

362
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,300
issues like real complex
issues like drug addiction.

363
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:16,301
And violence and poverty is that
once you feed it with any organism,

364
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:21,650
whether it's that organism is law
enforcement or that organism is education,

365
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,050
whichever one you feed is
the one that's going to grow.

366
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:29,000
And once you feed the law enforcement
one and you look at this really complex

367
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,863
situation,

368
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,430
I think law enforcement is important,

369
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,420
but I think education is probably
more important to avoid future law

370
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:35,991
enforcement.

371
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:38,300
Like the more I think the
more education we have,

372
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:38,811
the the,

373
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:43,811
the more nuanced our ability to raise
children is the more we understand that

374
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:45,380
we're all in this together,

375
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,000
the less you're gonna
need law enforcement.

376
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,930
But when law enforcement becomes
this machine that lobbies against the

377
00:12:50,931 --> 00:12:52,730
legalization of certain drugs,

378
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,800
which when you start looking at the data,

379
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,570
there's only one reason to do that.

380
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:59,510
And the only reason is that
you're trying to stay alive.

381
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,680
You're trying to grow,

382
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,580
you're an organism,

383
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,180
you're trying,

384
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,250
you're trying to eat the sugar
that's trying to keep going.

385
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,240
So you're creating more jobs
by putting people in jail.

386
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,110
It's essentially,

387
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,730
no one wants to look at it like this,

388
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,870
but it's a form of slavery.

389
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:12,670
Uh,

390
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,510
I think we in the house,

391
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:15,440
I live in the film,

392
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,890
Eugene Gr direct these film that,

393
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,240
I think that's the kind of analogy
he was trying to draw in that film.

394
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:20,841
Absolutely.

395
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,674
So I,

396
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,910
I think we get it.

397
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,620
I think a number of people get that.

398
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,180
That's exactly what it is.

399
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:28,910
Okay.
