1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
Due to
a Joseph Rogan.

2
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,670
I'm good man.
How you doing?

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,960
Great to see you.
As always.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,810
My Pool game was up to snuff.
Mine wasn't either.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,730
We both sucked.
We smoked.

6
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,340
I smoked a cigar before the,
uh,

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,740
this podcast during the last one and I'm
all jittery now.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,430
Yeah,
definitely.

9
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:27,690
Like everything's firing the nicotine
Jew in hamlet.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,510
No,
but just your mouth and smoking and suck

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,240
on it.
You get a get a nicotine.

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,190
I feel like I'm left out of a certain
club.

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,060
Those guys who think it's really cool to
relax with cigar smoking,

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,330
it makes me nauseous.
Yeah,

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,930
it's a.
It doesn't make me relax.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,240
It's fun.
I like to do it,

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,180
but it's a high ever.
They're lying to themselves.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,070
That's a high.
It's a nicotine high,

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,080
late course letterman.
And those guys were into the Hay.

20
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:54,900
They get in there doing drugs.
Drugs.

21
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,410
That's crazy.

22
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,240
That's illegal,
isn't it?

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,530
God Damn drug den.
You know what's hilarious?

24
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,440
Hepped up on something Chile tell you.
But it's one of those things.

25
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:06,441
It's like so common and it's so part of
the culture that we look at that as

26
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,901
being less ridiculous and more like
reserved and intelligent than if someone

27
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:16,590
got together and in a little shack there
like a smoke shop and there was smoking

28
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:17,430
pot together.
Yeah.

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,280
Those people I guess.
Well I get older.

30
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,920
I get more of a buzz from coffee than I
do from Xanax.

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,690
You do?
Oh fuck you.

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,720
Because annex just makes me feel like
what I think a normal person feels like,

33
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,420
you know,
without the terrifying anxiety.

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,750
We talked about this before,
but like when did you,

35
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:37,260
when did you start getting anxiety?
A second grade.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,970
Really?
Wow.

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,860
Yeah.
Second Grade,

38
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,060
but I'm really doing better.
Right.

39
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,020
Dr Says in 10 years I should be ahead of
it.

40
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,000
You never had anxiety of.
Definitely anxiety.

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,190
Yeah,
but about a specific thing.

42
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,040
The worst thing is just anxiety that you
don't even know what it's from.

43
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,230
Oh yeah.
I'm in the core of your being,

44
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,890
so it's an.
It's some sort of firing error or

45
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,180
something in your brain.
Yeah,

46
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:07,710
it's definitely a chemical thing.
And does anything else help it?

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,090
Like exercise help it or like alcohol,
alcohol helps.

48
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,430
But the thing about alcohol is the
rebound is worse than the high wire if

49
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,610
you have it.
If you have three hours of a buzz for

50
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,740
alcohol,
you'll have a 12 hour hangover.

51
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,050
Yeah.
Especially as you get older.

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,760
Yeah.
The hangovers get rougher and rougher

53
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:25,620
for me pretty much every year.
Well,

54
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:29,670
I never drank when I was young,
so this is all new to me the last few

55
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,503
years.
Like how many years?

56
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,880
A eight.
And I know you,

57
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,340
uh,
you stopped for awhile.

58
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,070
We talked about.
He stopped for a while.

59
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
So good.
I couldn't believe how good it feels.

60
00:02:38,881 --> 00:02:40,720
Not that big of a hangover.
Yeah.

61
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,880
Holy Shit,
this is it.

62
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,980
But you like it?
Well,

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,190
I like the whole unit,
how they,

64
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,300
you know,
but the unbeknownst to the score and the

65
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,660
puffin laughing and throw it raise and
up,

66
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,340
like he made a big point.
I like that with alcohol,

67
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:56,970
that whole social thing.
I like to have a drink with you too

68
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,560
because it's like we're announcing
festivities,

69
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,210
like

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,660
what the time fun festivities has.
She is my friend and we,

71
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:05,510
uh,
you know,

72
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,890
we both sort of agreed that we're off on
a alcohol filled,

73
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,320
fun,
Romp Chitchat and laughter.

74
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,870
But no Duis,
no Duis.

75
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,200
That's uh,
that's,

76
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,620
that's where Uber came in and changed
the game.

77
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,960
So I can't take it with the fucking uber
anymore.

78
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,650
Can't everybody's trying to convince me
like there's something wrong with me.

79
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,670
You kind of take Uber.
I go,

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,290
I don't want to take over.
I don't want to get in the car with a

81
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,050
strange guy.
I don't want to get into his own car.

82
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,500
I wanna I want to either get a car
service or take a cab.

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,850
He's just an old school guy.
I just don't want to.

84
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,740
I mean it's like.
And the thing that's funny about Uber to

85
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,150
me is the idea like,
you know,

86
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,980
I used to drink maybe one,
two drinks tonight,

87
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,010
but now say say I drink all day because
the uber brings you got colic.

88
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,080
Now what's funny about Uber is they,
it's like the application connecting,

89
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,040
like connecting people to people that
want something and those people get all

90
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:01,990
the money I think.
And then they pay the drivers,

91
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,380
right?
It's not how it works because you it up.

92
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,400
Understand that when I moved to New
York,

93
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:08,800
they had medallions.
They have to spend thousands of dollars

94
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,800
to get them a day and to be able to
drive a commercial vehicle here.

95
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:13,090
Anybody can drive an uber.
How's that?

96
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:16,870
That's why it's really crazy.
Because they are independent contractors

97
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,340
like in New York,
used to be illegal.

98
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,990
Used to have these things called Gypsy
cabs.

99
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,970
They still do.
Do you remember that?

100
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:23,350
One year?
Um,

101
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,830
there was a,
I want to say more than 40 gypsy cab

102
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,840
drivers were murdered.
Really?

103
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,730
Yeah.
But find this out.

104
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,090
Gypsy cab driver murders in New York.
I think they would take them to like bad

105
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,800
neighborhoods and shoot them and rob
them.

106
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,260
So these cab drivers who are fucked,
you know,

107
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,420
they weren't making much money.
They had to take every fair they could

108
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,390
and they would take these guys or one
guy.

109
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:48,160
I mean,
who knows how many people actually wound

110
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:52,750
up being the people killing them.
It was just say 1990.

111
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,880
This story is from.
That sounds about right.

112
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,620
That's when I was living there.

113
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,880
Gypsy cab driver was found shot dead in
the bronx.

114
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:04,990
That's the only one.
There was a k killings are related to

115
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,710
the three,
the six one back then I want to say it

116
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,390
was some insane number,
man.

117
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,500
I really think it was more than 20.
I want to say it's 40.

118
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,990
For some reason.
Cavities didn't get a fair shake.

119
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:19,330
The oldest hookers got killed.
Got a lot of press.

120
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,000
Well they got press in New York,
but this is press in 1990 or 91 or

121
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:28,090
whatever it was where it got real bad
before the Internet.

122
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,850
Exactly.
There was a time before the Internet

123
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:32,050
now.
Exactly.

124
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I mean,
yeah,

125
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,260
we became friends before the Internet.
How about that?

126
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:39,700
We even get ahold of each other.
We call each other on the phone.

127
00:05:39,701 --> 00:05:42,580
How to catch you when you're at home
like normally it's right up early.

128
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,170
Make phone calls before you leave the
house.

129
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,430
You remember the first cell phones?
They looked like it could use it as a

130
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,350
billy club here.
This right here.

131
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,800
Driving a gypsy cabs.
One the most dangerous jobs in New York

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,480
City.
Since 1990 180 drivers average of two a

133
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,070
month had been

134
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,170
killed while on duty.
Holy Shit.

135
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,410
So it wasn't foreign and there's one 80.
I mean maybe it was or not.

136
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,770
Not a 440,
but maybe that was one 80 when they

137
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:12,740
stopped counting during the time this
article is written because this is,

138
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,800
they're talking about 1990.
I was living in New York when this was

139
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:19,190
happening and I kind of moved there
around then so it could have gotten even

140
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,780
worse.
Do you ever miss it?

141
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,650
Do me neither.
You know you get the guys from New York.

142
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,750
I like the Kennedy's stand.
How you could make it here.

143
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,090
It's awesome.
Don't get me wrong.

144
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,970
I think I could adapt.
I think if I decided to live in New York

145
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:32,930
tomorrow,
I'd love it.

146
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,380
I don't think it's bad.
I don't miss your kids and the whole

147
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,000
thing is hard,
but you know what man?

148
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,440
I mean,
kids can grow up anywhere.

149
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,110
They really can't.
I just don't know if it's ideal when

150
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,080
you're rather than being walking around
where you live.

151
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,290
Then honestly,
I think really it's better probably in a

152
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,930
non showbiz related city.
I think just being in the city,

153
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:57,860
it's probably not healthy for kids.
I think kids are better off in places

154
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:00,980
like Seattle,
which is even if it's showbiz related,

155
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:03,140
it's not television,
film related.

156
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,310
Like I feel like the television and film
world is filled with so many people out

157
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,920
here and done me wrong.
I'm not saying it's a bad business.

158
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,280
I was in it for a long time.
Not that I don't mean anything against

159
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,040
it,
but I just think that the kind of people

160
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,440
that it attracts,
not all of them,

161
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,950
but a good amount of them are really
crazy and they're real needy and they

162
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,660
value the value of certain type of fame
with it gets.

163
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,690
It gets really crazy.
It gets really crazy.

164
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,970
We were talking about last night with
the girls to come in the store and

165
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,130
Sophie,
Sophie or Sophia Africa.

166
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,510
She said to me,
she didn't want to tell me she was an

167
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,860
actress.
She was embarrassed.

168
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,560
Decision in funny because well,
you know,

169
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,920
it's like I was doing the thing on stage
the other night about we need more

170
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:49,130
actors and actresses.
If you know anybody back east that wants

171
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:50,750
to be an actor,
tell them to come out here.

172
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,010
But it's sad when you're embarrassed to
say what you want to be.

173
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,290
There's nothing wrong with doing it,
so that's the problem.

174
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,750
Like do acting itself,
does nothing wrong with it.

175
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,240
As long as the lead.
I'm saying something wrong with the

176
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,110
profession.
It's just there's a giant number of

177
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,860
people who come out here that are just
absolutely bat shit crazy.

178
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,910
I know and they want.
They just want everybody to like us.

179
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,970
The other thing too,
there's like a lack of a.

180
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,520
it's very difficult when people are
judging you,

181
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,140
it's like there's a problem with the
entire design of the audition process

182
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,390
because you're creating people that are
going to be exactly what you want them

183
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:31,310
to be because those are the people that
you're going to hire,

184
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,550
so it becomes an incredibly left wing
environment.

185
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,130
It becomes real,
which is great and a lot of ways it

186
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:40,640
balances things out.
But our culture is driven primarily from

187
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:43,820
things from the left good things that
compassionate stuff like,

188
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,850
you know,
gay rights and gay marriage and a lot of

189
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,810
other like left wing type ideas that I
agree with that I think are great.

190
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,810
But it's 100 percent driven by that.
So these people,

191
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:57,150
if they have different opinions,
it's very difficult for them to express

192
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:02,010
it and still work like so you get a lot
of people that are terrified of stepping

193
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:04,800
on anybody's toes.
So they say a bunch of nonsense.

194
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,950
Like you ever talk to people that don't
say nice to meet you because they're

195
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,850
worried they might have already met you.
Right.

196
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:10,890
You know what I mean?
So they,

197
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,450
you know what they say?
They say nice to see you.

198
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,480
Well,
you know what I covered.

199
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,110
You know what?
I never did a people.

200
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,180
I never asked him what's up or what's
going on.

201
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,190
I know that about here because people
feel guilty like they have to recite in

202
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,720
what's going on in their lives.
This whole resume.

203
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,550
And I'd rather them just say,
hey man,

204
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,640
you know,
it's good to see you.

205
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,300
And that's the end of the things like,
I don't want to put.

206
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,020
Oh,
I got a lot of irons in the sound from

207
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,490
the impractical jokers.
Yeah.

208
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,110
He was out here one night.
He goes,

209
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,570
it's before they really hit.
He goes,

210
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,590
yeah,
I got nothing going on.

211
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:41,940
I said,
never say that in Hollywood.

212
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,620
I'm fucking when we got here,
here's what you say.

213
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,630
I got a lot of irons in the fire.
I don't want to jinx it.

214
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,920
Taste better when it comes through.
Big plans in the works.

215
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,980
Check my instagram page for future
notifications.

216
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,690
When you said you're really not part of
that part of the business anymore,

217
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:59,360
it's funny that you're so busy you don't
have time to do a movie.

218
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,820
Yeah,
kind.

219
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,460
Kinda cool.
The only movies I've ever done it the

220
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,050
Kevin James Movies,
so I didn't have to audition.

221
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,650
Yeah,
of course.

222
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,350
Got Me Parts.
You shouldn't have addition edition

223
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,550
should if you want something good.
But the process itself is the problem

224
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,890
with it.
Not necessarily for me who's a

225
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,640
financially independent,
but the process for a lot of people

226
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,480
aren't who are desperately needing
something to employ them.

227
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:26,230
So they can apply their craft,
so I don't need anybody to employ me so

228
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:29,290
that I could do standup.
Neither do we just do it and we don't

229
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,660
need anybody to employ us to do this
podcast.

230
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,220
We just do it.
You just do yours.

231
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:35,260
I just do my.
We all just do our own shit.

232
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,260
And because of that you don't.
You could be you.

233
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,610
You can actually be you.
Oh,

234
00:10:39,611 --> 00:10:41,980
the suits have lost so much power in the
last 10 years.

235
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,810
Yeah.
Well we're also starting to see like

236
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:47,140
what this,
what is this world really about?

237
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,850
It's about generating income.
That's it.

238
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,790
It's not about art.
That's why reality shows took off like

239
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:52,610
crazy.

240
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,860
Well,
your generation is much better than mine

241
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,260
as far as business people.
You guys,

242
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,430
your group is smart,
you know,

243
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,380
so.
Well,

244
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,620
you know,
you learn how to use social media to

245
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,650
your advantage.
You

246
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,311
know,
Tom,

247
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,320
a lot of it was luck.
A lot of it was locked.

248
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:10,680
Some of it was copying Dane Cook to do
some of it was definitely that.

249
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,590
I was already doing stuff online,
but I wasn't doing stuff.

250
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,020
I was writing blogs and I was doing
certain things,

251
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:20,430
so just as like a little exercise like
to just to come up with ideas and just

252
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:23,970
to get my writing flowing.
So I write a write a lot of blogs back

253
00:11:23,971 --> 00:11:27,980
then and Dane Cook,
I didn't have the mind space and you

254
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,420
started using it to promote shows and it
just,

255
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,350
it was crazy how much it blew him up.
He was an early adopter and he was the

256
00:11:34,351 --> 00:11:35,570
perfect guy for it,
you know,

257
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:40,140
cute high energy girls loved him and it
was like he was like one of the first

258
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,440
comics that had like a bunch of girl
fans.

259
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,390
It was like a rock and roll guy.
Very,

260
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:47,230
very interesting times.
But it,

261
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,900
I think it woke up everybody to the
power of social media and then twitter

262
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,980
came along of course.
But

263
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,080
the podcast thing was totally lucky,
man.

264
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,760
If it wasn't for just um.
Yeah,

265
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,070
but you had to be good at a gentleman to
sell it too much.

266
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,040
I wasn't good at in the beginning.
If you go back and listen to some of

267
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,420
those early ones are fucking terrible.

268
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,020
Well remember we were talking at the
Improv Cusco and I said to you,

269
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,280
uh,
and I didn't want you to think I was

270
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:11,310
hitting,
hitting me,

271
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,010
hitting to get onto the show,
but I said,

272
00:12:14,011 --> 00:12:15,200
I said to you,
uh,

273
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,760
if you do one of your shows,
it's better than doing all the late

274
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,440
night shows in one week.
Oh,

275
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:23,020
as far as like the mosher.
Yeah.

276
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,120
I feel like I'm doing,
I'm going to Australia tomorrow and

277
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,420
those people are going to be thrilled
that I'm going,

278
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,150
that I'm on the podcast because I was in
New Zealand and people listen to you

279
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:32,860
there,
you know,

280
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,640
it's an incredible.
Nobody,

281
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,520
nobody watches the tonight show in
Australia.

282
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,800
That's crazy.
The could show.

283
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,500
Yeah.
Podcasts are nuts,

284
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:43,940
man.
It's,

285
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,610
you can get them easy.
That's the thing about it.

286
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,060
If you have to watch the tonight show to
catch you,

287
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,300
the odds of you actually being in front
of your television when that happens are

288
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:54,160
small.
The odds of you dvr in this night show

289
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,710
or also small,
you know,

290
00:12:55,711 --> 00:12:58,530
it's usually one of those things where a
lot of people look forward to it and

291
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:01,020
they watched it before they go to bed.
It's a normal ritual.

292
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,870
I only use that as an example.
We couldn't,

293
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,100
but it's a good one.
It's a good example because that's what

294
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:05,980
we always needed,
right?

295
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,390
I mean Carson was the thing back when
you were coming up,

296
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,010
if you got on Carson,
Holy Shit,

297
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:14,430
you fucking made it and then you would
see a guy like Richard January 18

298
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:18,900
carson's or something like that and you
are brilliant and just such a great

299
00:13:18,901 --> 00:13:19,500
comic.

300
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,890
And you would,
you'd see those,

301
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,680
those credits and you go,
Jesus Christ,

302
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:25,350
I got did Carson 18 times.
Then you would go see him.

303
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:30,240
And of course he was at the time when I
first saw jenny was like in the

304
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,790
eighties.
He was a master a master.

305
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,240
I remember just being in awe and there
was a bunch of other comedians that were

306
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:36,990
at the,
uh,

307
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,780
east side comedy club member,
east side in Long Island.

308
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,060
Richard Mediterranean.
Yup.

309
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,470
Richmond Vini,
me and Kevin James,

310
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,080
we're sitting around after the show and
we're shaking her head.

311
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:46,861
We're like,
God damn,

312
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:48,300
he's good.
God dammit.

313
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,750
He apparently did two different hours on
a Friday night.

314
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,500
He did two shows and eight and 10 to two
completely different hours,

315
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,370
completely top to bottom,
and they were like both of them or

316
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,830
slaughtering his.
Just a destroyer.

317
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,220
Brilliant writer.
I remember feeling like when he.

318
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,860
He could take premises that you didn't
think there was anything there and you

319
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:09,630
can turn them into like one of your
favorite bits,

320
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,140
like you did a premise about buying a
corvette and the guy trying to talk them

321
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:14,640
into all sorts of stuff in the corvette.

322
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,590
And I remember thinking while he was
doing this,

323
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,690
wow,
how's this guy going to make this funny?

324
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,180
Yeah.
Talking about buying an expensive sports

325
00:14:21,181 --> 00:14:23,340
car and he's gonna figure out how to
make this funny.

326
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,810
Remember the Rep thing?
He did.

327
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,050
I had a bunch of football.
We didn't know he had problems with him

328
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:31,680
and I and it really was because of him
and let's say,

329
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:36,681
and they couldn't because he's dead now,
but what happened was we were like

330
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,300
getting different things at the same
time,

331
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,670
you know,
with each other.

332
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,070
Well,
he was competitive with me and I think

333
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,260
because people pitted us against each
other purely because we were short

334
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,650
Italians,
the short Italian as well,

335
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,070
but you've never been nothing but
supportive and nice

336
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,030
to meet you.
Joseph,

337
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,470
you know,
one time I said to him,

338
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,890
because somebody was talking about,
I said,

339
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:59,150
why don't we go out on the road
together?

340
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,650
Oh yeah,
we'll fill up theaters.

341
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,030
And he goes,
why would I want to do that?

342
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,460
I said,
I don't know.

343
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,210
Make money to have fun.
You know,

344
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:08,450
he didn't understand the concept.
He said to me one time,

345
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,330
he goes,
Montreal comedy festival,

346
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,030
you think I should go there?
I said,

347
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,020
go with the idea that you're going to
meet beautiful girls.

348
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:18,320
Go to great restaurants and if you
happen to get a deal you do but have

349
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,011
fun.
And he goes,

350
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:20,150
fine.
He looked at me like,

351
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,890
what do you mean fun?
This isn't fun.

352
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:26,330
It's just he was tortured.
He never enjoyed it.

353
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,270
That's the saddest part of it.
He was seeing never knew how good he was

354
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:29,420
there.

355
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,300
He never enjoyed how good he was.
I first met him in Montreal.

356
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,100
Yeah.
I first met him in like,

357
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,230
well,
isn't that where I met you?

358
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,580
Yup.
Yup.

359
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,210
I met him in 94 just so we were both
passing each other and in the front

360
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,640
doors just said,
hi.

361
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,650
Hey Man.
Nice to meet you,

362
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,201
blah blah blah,
blah,

363
00:15:45,201 --> 00:15:47,420
blah.
What shows you doing that kind of thing.

364
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,350
Just,
you know,

365
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,970
and it seemed to me like he just was a,
just a brilliant,

366
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,160
brilliant mind.
Like I'm always thinking,

367
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,570
but just always,
you know,

368
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,510
someone had maybe almost too much.
I saw him on a plane.

369
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,620
I was getting.
I was flying back.

370
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,930
Remember they had three cabins and the
American notice in first class he was in

371
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,240
coach with Lenny,
Lenny Clarke.

372
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,320
No,
law clerk.

373
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,030
Linny Africanus.
Lenny Shoultz.

374
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,280
Crazy.
Lenny crazy.

375
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,440
No,
not that crazy land.

376
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,970
More pigs.
More shit later.

377
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,440
Somebody fucking Lenny's income.
But what other,

378
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,080
Lenny Dave,
Hawthorne,

379
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,700
Hawthorne's friend,
he would know them.

380
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,110
But anyway,
uh,

381
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:27,380
he spent,
I walked back to say hi and he goes,

382
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,620
I usually play first myself,
but I'm plying him.

383
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:31,510
I said,
it's okay.

384
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,120
I said,
I went,

385
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,550
it's all right.
I didn't fly.

386
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:36,650
ABC flew me and he didn't like that
either.

387
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,510
I'm thinking I didn't do that to rub it
in.

388
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,490
And then I finally said to him,
rich,

389
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:42,380
what do you want me to do?
You want my cookie?

390
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,140
I'm just in first class.
It's not a big fucking deal.

391
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,380
You guys are so Italian.
That's such a fucking

392
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:54,190
good Chalami over there.
That fucking Salamis get tonight treads.

393
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,950
Yeah.
It's um,

394
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,060
it's a tough.
It's a tough lesson for those guys that

395
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:06,230
are super competitive and loaners.
It's a tough lesson as you start getting

396
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:09,230
older that none of this shit is fun if
you don't have friends.

397
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,870
Yeah.
You know what we're talking about.

398
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:15,300
Last night we were all hanging out is
you and me,

399
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,300
crusher and Josh Martin and all the
Jessie Mae Peluso.

400
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,520
We're all hanging out.
She's great.

401
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,920
She's so great.
But we're all laughing.

402
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,090
And having a great time and you know,
we're,

403
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,260
we're all comics,
you know,

404
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,710
that's supposed to be like that.
It's supposed to be.

405
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,850
We see each other,
we hug each other,

406
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,070
I get excited.
I remember when I went to see the

407
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:38,210
premiere of a Batman,
the very first one and Jack Nicholson

408
00:17:38,211 --> 00:17:40,930
was in it and he was at the bar and just
fucking drinking.

409
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,430
It's cheers where everybody in prince
was there.

410
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,150
Just little,
little kind of faggoty.

411
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,860
Prince are you say faggoty shit

412
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,953
now.
But anyway,

413
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,130
he's sitting there.
Joe,

414
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:56,220
he's got two body guards sitting in
front of me sitting there and he's not.

415
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,600
I'm thinking,
what fun is it?

416
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,300
Why don't you talk to somebody feels
like royalty though.

417
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,300
I mean the guy named himself prints.
How shocking is that?

418
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:08,301
He wants to be treated like royalty with
giant men guarding his flesh by the way.

419
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,610
He's got to get in my car.
I have an idea.

420
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,270
He had some high heels on too.
I guess he wrote the music for that.

421
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:18,270
But anyway,
it just struck me about here's Nicholson

422
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,330
easily just as famous if not more than
him.

423
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,430
And he was like,
miserable,

424
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,920
Nicholson's all having fun.
Well yeah,

425
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,480
some people don't know me,
but it's also part of what we were

426
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:33,660
talking about earlier.
You were talking about Brian and you

427
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,880
were saying that a colby,
as he's gotten older,

428
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,210
it's become more humble and how
convenient then when he's not doing good

429
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,140
and the legs and gaining their
personality.

430
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,860
But that could be the case,
but it also could be the case,

431
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,010
couldn't it?
That he's maturing as a man and learning

432
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:54,180
and absolutely lies against mistakes and
the consequences of his actions and

433
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:59,450
maybe reflecting on his behavior and
change who he is that's being alone with

434
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:01,050
all your money.
What are you gonna do put your money in

435
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:03,840
your bed and lay on it.
But those extreme winters,

436
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,100
extreme winters are so fucking hyper
crazy competitive.

437
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,210
Like.
Well,

438
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,020
when I was talking to Lance Armstrong,
it was really sinking in because I know

439
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,270
guys like him.
I know guys like him.

440
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:16,104
Whether it's,
you know,

441
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,120
fighters for the most part like you,
you like I know guys from the UFC dark.

442
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,310
They're extreme winters.
They know how to win.

443
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,670
And one of the ways to know how to win,
you got to say fuck everybody else.

444
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,110
And those guys did say fuck everybody
else like that in the world of art,

445
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,060
you know,
comedy and things along those lines.

446
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,410
It's like,
it's not necessary.

447
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,240
It's,
it fucks up.

448
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,300
It's not basketball.
We have to intimidate your opponent.

449
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,200
Like it's better for everybody if you're
nice to each other.

450
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,530
You know?
I never felt that somebody else's

451
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,780
success diminished me.
Yeah.

452
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,780
Like when I first started out,
Eddie Murphy was at the same time he was

453
00:19:51,781 --> 00:19:53,520
getting these movies and some fucking
Guido,

454
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:54,560
because there's no,
I'm not,

455
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,560
don't bother you.
Any movers getting these movies and you

456
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,400
were here at bananas.
I go,

457
00:19:59,401 --> 00:20:00,930
what the fuck does it have to do with
me?

458
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:03,540
Do you think if he didn't get 48 hours I
would have gotten it.

459
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,433
Yeah.
You know,

460
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:06,660
that mentality is just a loser
mentality.

461
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,460
And it all it is,
is a pattern.

462
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,210
You let your brain go down that path.
There's a pattern of behavior,

463
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,490
like you recognize that somebody else
has something,

464
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:16,290
you want that something and then you'd
be upset.

465
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,640
That person has it and then you don't,
and it becomes this animal instinct

466
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:22,320
thing.
It's like a jealousy.

467
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,810
I mean,
Chimpanzees Have Horrible Jealousy,

468
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,310
dop,
real horrible jealousy.

469
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,300
That guy that got his face bit off and
it's difficult often.

470
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,160
Remember that guy I didn't remember.
I remember a woman getting her face.

471
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,920
There was a woman who did,
but before the woman who did see the

472
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:39,921
woman who did it was because her friend
had the champ and the woman who lived

473
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,510
with the champ had some weird
relationship with the champion.

474
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:44,970
She slept with it.
She gave him a Xanax and she gave him

475
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,890
red wine,
so he's fucking chimp was drunk and on

476
00:20:47,891 --> 00:20:48,670
pills

477
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,270
and he ripped this lady's face off.
So that's one chimp or had been drunk

478
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:54,070
and on pills,
that's one champ.

479
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,120
But then there was another champ with
this guy had a pet chimp and he went to

480
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:01,210
visit his pet chimp and the chimp got to
be a certain age.

481
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:04,150
They had to get rid of it cause it was
biting people and it was terrifying.

482
00:21:04,151 --> 00:21:05,920
Right?
I think a bit someone's finger off so

483
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,760
they.
Because that's what they do.

484
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,830
The grab your hand,
they bite your finger off,

485
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:13,360
they tear your finger from your hand and
they do it like almost instantly.

486
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,920
That's the move.
Um,

487
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,130
if you're lucky,
if they don't go for your face left

488
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,450
southern,
lift me then with the squirrel monkey.

489
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:21,700
Once I was,
before I was in first grade,

490
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:25,470
I was so kindergarten kid,
just me and this squirrel monkey started

491
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,470
fucking hissing at me.

492
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,300
Oh,
I was fucking terrified.

493
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,360
My grandmother had a monkey.
My grandmother had a monkey.

494
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:33,780
They lived in a base,
hit a squirrel monkey.

495
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:37,930
It was called Chichi gum chew gum.
It was like open up gum wrappers and

496
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:42,040
chew gum,
gets a monkey fucking out of their mind.

497
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,240
So anyway,
these people,

498
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,480
they went to visit their pet chimp at
the sanctuary because they still loved

499
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,350
them.
They had a relationship with this champ,

500
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,213
you know,
and they're like,

501
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,320
we can't be with you anymore,
but we're coming to visit.

502
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,260
And when they came to visit,
they dropped off cake.

503
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,840
They gave him a cake,
a birthday cake.

504
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,200
And the other chimps got furious that
this chimp got cake and that they didn't

505
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,080
and someone fucked up and left something
open and they got out and when they got

506
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:15,100
out they tore this guy apart just
because he gave cake to this one guy and

507
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,000
he didn't give it to him.

508
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,250
So they tore his dick off towards
fingers off.

509
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:20,830
But it's face off.
They just tear you apart.

510
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,570
Uh,
they bought all your fingers off.

511
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:24,250
They don't give a fuck.
They're monsters.

512
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,850
I was on one of those shows.
Pet store or one.

513
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,040
Remember that?
The way the judge,

514
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,820
different animal tricks.
No,

515
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:34,420
it's holding a baby gorilla.
I mean really young.

516
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:37,100
But I mean I thought that this thing is
going to be so fucking powerpoint.

517
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,480
It was just like a baby put his head on
my shoulder and started making out with

518
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:41,230
it.
It was nice.

519
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,520
Well,
gorillas are more peaceful,

520
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:47,200
I think a real other than chimps.
Chimps are crazy serve way more violent.

521
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,220
I mean,
they're all violent.

522
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,031
They're all vital.
I mean,

523
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:52,330
gorillas are vegetarians.
It pretty much exclusively.

524
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,180
So when you see a gorilla and those
giant fangs that they have,

525
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,380
that's just for fighting nothing else.

526
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,710
So they've definitely fight each other,
especially the males.

527
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,160
There was a video of a zoo recently.
These two males beating the shit out of

528
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:06,670
each other and some wildlife preserve
crazy.

529
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,820
See how strong they are.
It's just weird that they're like our

530
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,610
size but stronger tens.
I'm stronger with every way.

531
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:15,490
Heavier.
Full grown grown like 500 pounds or

532
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:17,680
something crazy.
I think that makes sense.

533
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,600
Yeah,
I think they get even bigger.

534
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,060
Would it?
How big is the biggest silver back

535
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:23,440
gorilla?
If you had to guess,

536
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,350
would you guys?
Seven hundred pounds.

537
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,010
Wow.
It sort of gets ruined by $400.

538
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,140
That's big.
I'm going to go with five,

539
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,330
500 pounds.
I'll take the.

540
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,240
I'll take the under.
You might be right though.

541
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,350
It might be like 800 or something.
I don't know.

542
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:44,290
I'm excited to find the results.
Oddly that Jamie,

543
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,040
I

544
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,800
found a gorilla named titus.
I'm trying to find out if it's a

545
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,400
documentary named titus,
the gorilla king.

546
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:53,540
I'm trying to find the size.

547
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,350
This is not helping me.
Jamie,

548
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,290
Google Gorillas,
mountain gorilla,

549
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,940
gorilla.
Just Google gorilla.

550
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,340
You go to Wikipedia and it tells you
exactly how much grill is way gorilla.

551
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,200
Gorilla Cook.
I'm saying 500 pounds.

552
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,600
I'm saying a full grown grill is 500
pounds.

553
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,930
That's what I'm going with that I think
I went over to for 700.

554
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,500
You might not.
I'm going to number eight for some

555
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,960
reason is in my head.
Eight hundred pounds is in my head.

556
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,470
Are they 800 pound gorilla?
It was something that was 3,500 pound

557
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,030
gorilla,
right?

558
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,040
Wasn't that what they always said?
I don't know the 500 pound gorilla in

559
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,240
the room.
Oh,

560
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,300
wasn't it like the elephant in the room?
Five hundred pound gorilla was the one

561
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,570
who could do anything.
You want

562
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,590
about 510 pounds in the wild.

563
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,150
Vizio.
No beast.

564
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:48,370
White gorilla knowledge.
Hey.

565
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,240
All my people,
I was thinking like Comedians,

566
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,000
like are smart.
Some of them I was with the dumbest

567
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:56,250
fucking group of Comedians that live
fact the other night.

568
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,890
First of all,
they go,

569
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:01,120
uh,
I'm going to Australia tomorrow.

570
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:03,010
I told you that the Sydney Festival in
Perth,

571
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,380
in Australia.
Anyway,

572
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,270
they said,
how far is it?

573
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,230
One of the guys?
I said,

574
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,700
uh,
from Sydney to La.

575
00:25:11,701 --> 00:25:14,960
Sydney is 7,000 miles because Xero like,
oh yeah.

576
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,721
What'd you think?
He goes,

577
00:25:15,721 --> 00:25:17,160
I thought it was a couple of hundred
thousand miles.

578
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,860
Ten thousand miles.
How far?

579
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,890
What's the circumference of the earth?
He goes,

580
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,080
I don't know.
A couple hundred thousand.

581
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,670
No,
it's 24,000 miles.

582
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:28,470
Something that they didn't know
anything.

583
00:25:28,471 --> 00:25:29,220
Joe,
that,

584
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,490
which I was like so fly and I'm not
going to take us,

585
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,400
you know,
all these guys.

586
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,720
One Guy said,
I said,

587
00:25:33,721 --> 00:25:35,170
well,
how far do you think the earth is from

588
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,760
the son?
He Gun,

589
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,990
I don't know,
like 4,000.

590
00:25:36,991 --> 00:25:38,820
5,000.
Well,

591
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:45,350
the sun is 93 million miles and we still
get a sunburn like this wizard.

592
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,280
Yeah,
you're Carl Sagan all of a sudden.

593
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,990
That's hilarious.

594
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,970
That's funny.
A couple late years.

595
00:25:56,971 --> 00:26:01,770
Some people don't even consider the fact
that we're on a giant 24,000 mile ball

596
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,600
and we get cocky as if a kid just
dressed,

597
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:06,870
but if it dropped two feet,
we'd all feel it.

598
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,100
We will if we get hit with something.
That's just the thing that gets me.

599
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,810
Did you see that recent impact they
spotted on Jupiter?

600
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,240
They watched a comic collab with
Jupiter.

601
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,860
Who?
A comic.

602
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,270
No.
Yeah,

603
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:22,950
he was up there bombing.
They hired him for a corporate gig.

604
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,090
You do corporate gigs.
Dom?

605
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,100
Not many
too.

606
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,970
I've had people crying.
I'm the president of a company with a

607
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:38,510
wipe was crying,
which are really good.

608
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,920
It's not.
It's not for me.

609
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,793
Grow Up,
bitch.

610
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,360
You what?
The corporate,

611
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,120
right?
Just do your

612
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:46,380
own thing.
It's not worth it.

613
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,310
Somebody just offered you when a buddy
of mine who works in a company and it

614
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:54,000
would be a cool Gig,
be involved,

615
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,150
but you know what I,
you know,

616
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,870
it's always a keywords but it's got to
keep it clean,

617
00:26:57,871 --> 00:26:59,220
but it's not much money.
Hey,

618
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,730
why don't you go fuck you.
So why do you ever see my standup?

619
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,130
Brian Cowen did one recently.
Yeah,

620
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:09,360
but he could do it,
but the guy told him right before he was

621
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:12,990
doing this thing and he was,
this is a different story,

622
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,360
but it wasn't a,
it was a benefit.

623
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,194
That's what it is.
Okay.

624
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,720
He did a benefit and right before he was
like,

625
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,370
you know,
it's a non standup environment.

626
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:24,240
That's how it's connected.
It's doing a standup comedy show in

627
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:27,510
something that's other than a standup
comedy show,

628
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,000
you know,
so if it's got some sort of an auction,

629
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:31,200
some benefit or something like that.

630
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,740
And he was a part of it.
It was some dude,

631
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:35,910
he knows it's famous.
So he goes and right before he's about

632
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:39,570
to go on,
they tell him to keep it pg.

633
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,560
They tell them keep it.
PG is a lot of religious people here.

634
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:45,690
Keep it pg and me.
It's like what?

635
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:46,471
Like,
wait,

636
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,770
what are you saying?
You're saying you,

637
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,770
you,
you want me to come out here and do

638
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:53,010
stand up,
but you want me to keep it like you're

639
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,370
gonna tell me this right before I go on
stage.

640
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:56,490
Like I have an alternative set,
like you know,

641
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:59,610
Brian is an hour that he does everywhere
on the road.

642
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,390
He's got it honed down to a science and
that's what he's ready to do and right

643
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,090
before he's ready to do that,
they come to him and tell him to keep

644
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,280
it.
That's ridiculous.

645
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,730
You know what?

646
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,950
I hate you a little blue.
You can be a little blue.

647
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:13,710
What the fuck does that mean?
Don't hire some.

648
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,570
So relative.
Don't.

649
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,220
Don't ask him to go.
If you don't know what someone like,

650
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:20,730
if you want to hire Gary Clark Jr,
but you want to play the fiddle.

651
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,950
He doesn't play the fucking fiddle.
Stupid.

652
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,470
He's a guitar.
I mean he probably does if he wants to.

653
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,170
If we want it to me.
Yeah,

654
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,330
but you hire.
You're hiring Gary Clark junior to do

655
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:31,750
Gary Clark Jr.
That's where you start.

656
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,060
That's what you want them to do,
right?

657
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,150
You don't ask them to fucking sing like
adele.

658
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,500
It's stupid to try to get an r rated
comic like callan and tell him to be pg

659
00:28:42,031 --> 00:28:43,830
right before he goes on stage.
That's rude.

660
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,350
He's not even that dirty,
but he's definitely not pg.

661
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,450
He Talks a lot about a lot of caulk.

662
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

663
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,300
A lot of busy work at it.
I can't tell he does like a dancer,

664
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,430
but I love to fuck with him.
I know he gets it,

665
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,390
but he's.
He's plays along with it,

666
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,840
but also actually gets insulted at the
same.

667
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,020
It's still hurt his feelings.
He'll play along with it.

668
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,180
Talk about himself and I'm built for
dance.

669
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:10,500
I'm bill.
I'm more like a woman.

670
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:11,011
And you go,
yeah,

671
00:29:11,011 --> 00:29:11,341
yeah,
yeah.

672
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:14,340
Like a we'll womanly like a woman,
like now hip,

673
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:16,750
so it would have to have a cesarean
section and the,

674
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,270
you a hits them like,
whoa,

675
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,660
that doesn't feel good.
I remember I told,

676
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,630
I told him,
joe,

677
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,483
that says,
you know,

678
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,600
it's interesting the way you're standing
up as a.

679
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,060
You don't particularly go for the laugh,
you know,

680
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:29,470
you don't pander to the crib,
but trying to like entertain the middle

681
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,770
and he was going to fuck with me a
little bit.

682
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,970
Then he goes,
brian,

683
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,500
I'm kidding.
But I got them a little joey diaz pulled

684
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:39,720
his dick out on stage once and tom turns
to me and goes,

685
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,950
I see he's been writing again.

686
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,830
That was fucking funny.
It's funny.

687
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,560
I mean that's another example.
Like of friendship.

688
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,980
Joey diaz,
you know joe,

689
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,560
he loves everybody who's around.
Joey loves joey and everybody in joey

690
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,870
circle.
Joey's in a circle of love.

691
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,470
Like if you talked to joel or anybody
like with its least siad or any of the

692
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,840
people that he knows and the people that
he's around with all the time.

693
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,040
Or it's me.
You're dunking or ari.

694
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,570
Everybody loves him.
So he's around love and support all the

695
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,820
time.
I love his phone call.

696
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:21,440
She get them to write equals me is the
only instance.

697
00:30:21,441 --> 00:30:24,390
Ms dot maria.
You okay?

698
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,151
Yeah.

All right baby.

00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,260
Yeah.
He calls people up to tell you he loves

702
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,730
you.
Just checks in on you.

703
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:33,090
He's a jam.
What a fucking killer acting.

704
00:30:33,091 --> 00:30:33,910
You never know.

705
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,390
he was murdered in santa barbara to
woof.

706
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,180
He plants his feet there and he fucking
kills god.

707
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,820
Damn.
He's.

708
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,990
He's hot right now.
Damn.

709
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,600
You know joe is,
he's on fire.

710
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,720
He puts out a lot of material to joe.
He's always working on some new stuff,

711
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,730
you know,
just always working on some news.

712
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,440
He found this,
he found his voice,

713
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:54,490
you know?
Oh yeAh.

714
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,310
And he's also like really popular right
now.

715
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,450
LIke joey is selling out theaters.
Are you selling out the wilbur in

716
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:03,250
boston?
He's a,

717
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:05,410
he,
he can sell out a lot of pretty big

718
00:31:05,411 --> 00:31:08,380
places right now.
Sells out comedy clubs like crazy so

719
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:11,170
people know what they're getting into.
They're looking forward to seeing them

720
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:15,970
and when joey feels comfortable,
like he's the most funniest when he's

721
00:31:15,971 --> 00:31:17,400
around like us.
So yeah,

722
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,470
because he's the most comfortable
because he just surrounded by love and

723
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:22,660
then they'll start talking shit and then
you'll be crying.

724
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,270
Next thing you know you're crying,
you know,

725
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:29,200
but now that he gets that everywhere he
goes now because for years he had to get

726
00:31:29,201 --> 00:31:31,810
these people to like him before he could
be uncle joey.

727
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,230
He had to get them to like him and that
was part of the struggle was getting

728
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,880
these people to understand what is in
front of them.

729
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:40,010
They're looking at this 300 pound Cuba
and talking about eating asshole.

730
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,670
You got to eat.
Am I right?

731
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,690
Am I right ladies?
My floor.

732
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,760
And they're like,
what the fuCk?

733
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,510
They don't know what to expect and they
didn't plan on seeing that.

734
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,750
So it takes a while,
but now that you plan on seeing it and

735
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:55,150
you know you're going to see them.
Then joey diaz,

736
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,150
if you go to a joey diaz show,
you go see him perform.

737
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,420
It's all joey diaz fans and it's
beautiful.

738
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,460
Beautiful.
We're splitting the bill at the ice

739
00:32:04,461 --> 00:32:05,230
house.
Yeah,

740
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,310
last year.
A few times.

741
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:08,020
there's so much.
His fans are so much fun.

742
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

743
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,150
And fans of his will be fans of you and
fans of you be fans of his.

744
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,160
It's a great combination.
What?

745
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,990
I mean,
he's exactly what I'm talking about.

746
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,390
The guy,
he made it because he's.

747
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:22,180
He's good,
but he got exposure on the internet.

748
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,520
It wasn't.
It wasn't through the regular.

749
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:28,030
The old channels with the tonight show
or hbo special or any of that shit?

750
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,870
No,
they were,

751
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,450
they were all upset that it wasn't
happening that way.

752
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,090
Um,
ari was real upset about that are we was

753
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:38,350
real disgusted at one point in time by
the old regime at comedy central and he

754
00:32:38,351 --> 00:32:40,070
was like,
they kept the same fucking

755
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,180
people.
I'll never geT in there.

756
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:45,200
and meanwhile now he's got a show in the
second season on comedy central and

757
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,530
everything about it,
like all the stuff that kicked off,

758
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:52,010
kicked off because of the internet,
the amazing racist stuff that he did and

759
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,700
then ruin.
He used to do ask a jew at the comedy

760
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:58,970
store.
He said he was on my podcast,

761
00:32:58,971 --> 00:32:59,804
joe.
And he goes,

762
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,830
what is it about me that look so jewish?
I said,

763
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,830
I dunno,
you know,

764
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,360
he's just being a little.
I'm jewish,

765
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:05,810
right?
You know,

766
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,240
I'm a jew by looking at me.
I said,

767
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,620
what is the definitive features that.
Go aHead.

768
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,940
I don't know.
Your eyes,

769
00:33:10,941 --> 00:33:11,960
your nose.
I don't,

770
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,000
I don't really want to break it down.
Your hair.

771
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,380
Jews a weird one because it's a
religion.

772
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:21,410
But it's also a race,
like we say,

773
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:22,880
a guy looks jewish.

774
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,700
You know what I'm saying?
Like you don't say guy looks catholic,

775
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,160
but you can be jewish.
The mayor of Ireland was jewish and he

776
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:30,860
had red hair and blue eyes.
The mayor of Ireland was jewish.

777
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,890
Mayor of dublin rather.
Really?

778
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:35,280
Yeah.
How can we be a mayor of violence?

779
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,040
You know what?
Size of a state they should get stopped

780
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,870
being all high and mighty.
Come over the United States folks.

781
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,620
I'll be in cacao.
Thailand.

782
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,320
I'll be in the may.
June.

783
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,330
Find people.
Man,

784
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,920
I would love to have you.
But I was telling you about me and bird

785
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:55,100
over there crying.
Lift and you were talking about our.

786
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,820
I've done dublin a couple times and I
did a northern Ireland.

787
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,890
Belfast.
Love it up there.

788
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,240
It's fun.
They're fun people,

789
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:04,070
man.
They're why I had a conversation with

790
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:08,300
this fucking guy in a bar in belfast.
We were both hammered,

791
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:09,410
but he was.

792
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,350
He was talking in a different language.
I mean,

793
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,880
I'm not,
I'm not exaggerating.

794
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:17,540
I barely understood what he was talking
because they don't open their mouth like

795
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:20,510
the north north of Ireland and scotland
are very similar.

796
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,370
that would.
A lot of the demo opened their mouth

797
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:25,280
when they talk,
so you can't even lip read and all he

798
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:27,290
kept saying was,
I'll fight any man.

799
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,920
That's all I could hear.
I'm fight any man because I knew we were

800
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:35,510
here for the ufc because
I check my data.

801
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,320
Any man.
I just kept repeating himself.

802
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,290
Mike.
All rigHt dude.

803
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,020
Okay.
Go fight any man.

804
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,870
Good luck with all that.
I didn't know what to tell them how to

805
00:34:44,871 --> 00:34:48,680
fight.
Anyone hammered eyes rolling around in

806
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,560
his head.
Just prided himself on the beating that

807
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:54,900
he can take in.
Glasgow is doing it to show and this

808
00:34:54,901 --> 00:34:57,230
woman I couldn't understand her and the
stage manager.

809
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,490
I said,
I'm sorry.

810
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:00,490
Excuse me in front of.
She goes appeal.

811
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,970
We have a language,
bobby.

812
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:07,280
I said,
we just started laughing and then just

813
00:35:07,281 --> 00:35:10,610
got a translator for me.
A translator speak english.

814
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,001
Well,
yeah.

815
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:13,250
Have you ever see trainspotting?
Yeah.

816
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,120
Movie that they have the subtitles,
even though they're all speaking english

817
00:35:17,121 --> 00:35:19,280
through either a smart because it's hard
to understand that for us.

818
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,220
Yeah,
they do that a lot on like reality shows

819
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,920
and stuff.
TheY'll put in subtitles.

820
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,090
People are whispering about shit,
you know?

821
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,073
Yeah,
yeah.

822
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,790
But um,
the fact that the slang or the waY they

823
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:36,230
talk in northern Ireland,
their dialect is so much different than

824
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,730
american english,
but they can understand us.

825
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,460
Like if I'm tAlking like this,
everybody can understand me.

826
00:35:41,461 --> 00:35:42,900
Right.
But they grew up on our media,

827
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,050
but then talking to that and fashion is
a thing that there's a difference

828
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:47,360
between the way the doctors are already.

829
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,710
Otherwise I mushed together.
It's pretty good.

830
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,790
They're smushed.
we're,

831
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,010
we're,
we're lazier with our words.

832
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,820
But do you understand that they grew up
watching the sopranos and seinfeld,

833
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:03,500
we didn't grow up watching father ted or
any of those english or irish shows now.

834
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,440
Well,
top gear,

835
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,510
top gear with jeremy clarkson.
Richard hammered.

836
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,350
Oh,
what's his name?

837
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,920
Richard hammond and something.
James may.

838
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

839
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,340
A great show.
I vaguely remember that.

840
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,350
But jeremy clarkson's,
one of the funniest guys on tv in

841
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:21,480
england who's hilarious,
hilarious,

842
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,980
just a car reviewer and just as a writer
and a guy reviewed cars,

843
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,480
love cars,
but he,

844
00:36:27,481 --> 00:36:29,100
uh,
he punched his producer.

845
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,810
They canceled the show apparently.
I don't know what happened.

846
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,130
Human,
the guy I've made up,

847
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:37,920
but they're already fired him,
so I'm now they're going to do it on

848
00:36:37,921 --> 00:36:41,190
amazon now than to do the same show,
but they have to come up with a new name

849
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:44,160
for it because jeremy clarkson has been
talking about it and it won't come out.

850
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,140
It will be more than a year from the
time they fired him before this new one

851
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:51,150
comes out.
Maybe contractual stuff.

852
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:54,240
But the,
in that time they hired a whole new crew

853
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,300
of top gear and I wonder how the new
crews doing the new crew of top gear was

854
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,050
on Arizona.
Who was it?

855
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:02,340
Chris evans is on it.
I don't know.

856
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,400
Google it.
You asked me what am I a fucking

857
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:11,570
chris evans and matt lewis.
Matt leblanc from friends in england?

858
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,370
No,
the tv show friends.

859
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,190
Right in england.
He's doing copier in england.

860
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,300
Jamie,
you stoned.

861
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,740
What's goIng on?
A little bit here.

862
00:37:19,741 --> 00:37:20,520
A little out of it.
No,

863
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,410
I'm telling you.
Chris evans,

864
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:22,830
the joe.
I did twice.

865
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,330
oh,
did right before the show.

866
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,050
How dare you?
chris evans being straight youtube car

867
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,940
guy.
He's one of the host on the show to

868
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,750
england.
Yeah,

869
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:34,220
he was on the podcast and matt leblanc
from friends.

870
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:35,880
He's.
There's seven people that are on it.

871
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:39,870
Seven people on the new english block in
england.

872
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,570
So it was matt leblanc live in england.
No,

873
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,280
don't know.
Well there is number three.

874
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,760
How weird.
Well that's interesting that they

875
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,670
decided to go completely crazy and put
six hosts instead of three.

876
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:55,980
Yes.
I'm sure they just team up to do

877
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,570
different challenges like they did
before,

878
00:37:57,571 --> 00:37:59,730
but who are.
Who is everybody there for the rest of

879
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:01,800
the people on to.
It looks like lebron james or the

880
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:02,670
airline.
Adam

881
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,530
james with the air let out.
There's no list of the names.

882
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,060
No,

883
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,180
I hear.
Hmm.

884
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,333
It's weird.

885
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,310
This is on what?
Bbc?

886
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,230
Yep.
Boy,

887
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:17,030
they got fucking boring television.
Find out what,

888
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:20,540
what the cast is because who was that
one guy in the background?

889
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,860
There's not chris harris.
Ah,

890
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,920
that's what I was trying.
No,

891
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,640
chris evans.
No,

892
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,840
you mean chris harris?
The guy that was on the podcast game.

893
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,040
You said the wrong name was chris evans.

894
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,930
I don't know why I keeps saying chris
evans everywhere.

895
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,340
Is that his name was chris harris?
Yeah,

896
00:38:39,341 --> 00:38:39,770
that's right.
Yeah.

897
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,010
Is it you show the same guy?
Maybe it's chris evans and not chris

898
00:38:43,011 --> 00:38:44,900
harris.
I'm sure they probably know his name.

899
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,090
Sorry.
This is obviously.

900
00:38:51,091 --> 00:38:52,050
It's a different guy.

901
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:57,510
WHo is this a?
We'll just go to just google.

902
00:38:57,511 --> 00:39:00,720
Chris evans.
Let's see what the fuck's going on here.

903
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,280
Get to the bottom of this.
God damn it.

904
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,820
Jesus christ our era.
I hardly remember that show.

905
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,990
We'll get a photo of this gentleman.
So we'll see.

906
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,220
It looks like chris evans.
That's not chris harris.

907
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,200
So chris harris is the guy that was on
here?

908
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,183
Yes.

909
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,200
Is he on this new show?

910
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,790
Maybe they're both on it and that's why
I'm confused.

911
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,610
It looks like it.
That's chris harris,

912
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:23,390
right?

913
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,880
Yes.
This must be confirmed.

914
00:39:25,881 --> 00:39:27,980
So he's one of the new top gear host.
Aha.

915
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,240
All right,
that makes sense.

916
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:31,520
So that's chris evans,
who's the redheaded gentlemen.

917
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,800
And then there's chris harris who's been
on the show.

918
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,090
Oh,
well that might work.

919
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,120
That fucking guy's hilarious.
Harris is hilarious.

920
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,800
He's really funny,
man.

921
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,950
He was really fucking smart to really
smart.

922
00:39:42,951 --> 00:39:44,060
What's his ethnic background?

923
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,170
So she's a,
she's a german.

924
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,240
I think she's like a bmw driver.
This girl's been schmidts.

925
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,950
The middle guy looks familiar to me.
Like you get out driver even though

926
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:55,560
you're a man,
don't you feel like there's something

927
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:57,630
about you though when maybe.
I mean I just got

928
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,510
tear it up.
I got my own business.

929
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,430
So basically I'm a race car driver.
take turns.

930
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,460
He's a that chris harris guys.
Awesome though his series.

931
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:12,280
Chris harris on cars on youtube.
like one of the best,

932
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,950
uh,
reviews of automobiles.

933
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,990
He's like one of the most thorough,
one of the most humorous and so educated

934
00:40:19,991 --> 00:40:22,960
and knowledgeable about the inner
workings of a car and why certain

935
00:40:22,961 --> 00:40:26,260
aspects of a car affect other aspects of
it and like what's good and what's bad.

936
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,200
He's just a wizard man.
He's really good.

937
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:33,940
He's a perfect guy to replace jeremy
clarkson because it's humor is also very

938
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:37,540
british.
It's not as insulting as jeremy clarkson

939
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:41,460
tend to be and probably not as like go
for the punchline is jeremy clarks,

940
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,680
clarks,
and has some hilarious punchlines.

941
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,190
He's a really funny guy,
man.

942
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,330
HIs reviews of cars were awesome.
It was like I watch it and just fast

943
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:52,660
forward through the other shit until he
would get to a car because he's just

944
00:40:52,661 --> 00:40:53,980
fun.
What was it on here?

945
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,250
It was on bbc America.
Okay.

946
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,080
But,
uh,

947
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,220
there's a top gear and then there's a
top gear from here,

948
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,960

949
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,900
rutledge who was here.
Um,

950
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,900
and um,
our buddy adam ferraris on it.

951
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,080
Tanner foust,
that's the show.

952
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,910
Adams on.
He's on the american version,

953
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,100
the american version of top gear
finally.

954
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:19,120
Okay.
We love you,

955
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,400
adam.
There we go.

956
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,730
Chris harris,
a youtube star.

957
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:28,340
they're calling them chris harris.
f one pundit eddie Jordan,

958
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:33,610
motoring journalists.
Rory read and chris evans and matt and

959
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,770
the stig show returns in may.
Interesting.

960
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:38,730
So it's returning next montH.
Hmm.

961
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,990
She looked mad if harris is on it and
they let him do his thing,

962
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,270
it'll be awesome.
Matt leblanc grew up.

963
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:45,650
Grew up in my town.
Really?

964
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:46,640
Yeah.
He grew up in newton.

965
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,163
I,
uh,

966
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,230
heard about him when I moved here.
I think we dated the same girl at one

967
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:57,770
point in time when we were young,
like when we're like teenage years or

968
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:59,810
something like that.
Say mitch?

969
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,760
I think so.
I'm 48.

970
00:42:01,761 --> 00:42:03,620
I think he's 48,
two or something close to it.

971
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,210
Uh,
but yeah,

972
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:06,680
he's from newton.
He's from newton,

973
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:08,030
Massachusetts.
He's 48.

974
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:09,770
Yeah.
I never meT that dude though.

975
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,000
It's what?
John katz lips.

976
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,770
Dr cat.
How's he doing?

977
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,090
Is he doing okay?
Is that right?

978
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,400
It's still having some nerve problems
where those nerves and mess,

979
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:22,400
at least I don't need as a motherfucker
always was.

980
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,040
He was the host of the first open mic
night I ever did.

981
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,470
Really?
He's not the kind of guy that should be

982
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,730
hosting.
He was great.

983
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,660
Was it good?
Yeah,

984
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,010
he was great.
I mean it was a pro.

985
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,510
Knew what he was doing.
He's a pro,

986
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,060
but as it stitches comedy club in
boston,

987
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,740
1988.
August 27th.

988
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,870
We were talking about garry shandling,
you know,

989
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:40,971
august,
28th,

990
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:42,070
19,
19,

991
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,060
August 27th,
19,

992
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,300
88 today.
The garry shandling man.

993
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:50,360
So sad with john was telling me about
ally and he said on the,

994
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,490
on dr katz,
he said,

995
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:55,490
it's important when you're making little
dual woman that you end at the same

996
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:56,750
time.
And gary said,

997
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,520
no,
actually it's more important to begin.

998
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:02,690
Same time
that you begin making love at the same

999
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:03,340
time,
you know?

1000
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,350
Yes.
It's typical john,

1001
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,710
dr katz kind of joke.
It's just not hitting me.

1002
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:13,560
Whatever reason I can't pay you.
So that's why I said It was their job

1003
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,210
to take.
Maybe it's coming out of your mouth.

1004
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:20,390
I'm expecting be as funny is what you
come up with dom.

1005
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,450
They could show you.
It's how,

1006
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,760
you know what I mean brother.
Appreciate it.

1007
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,740
My pleasure.
Trying to write.

1008
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,000
You know that you want.
Well,

1009
00:43:26,001 --> 00:43:27,860
you're always reading.
You're uh,

1010
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,970
you're one of those guys that's.
You're always enjoying the process.

1011
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,700
You know,
I think the funniest people that I know

1012
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:38,070
are all the ones like you are ds or
birth or any,

1013
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:40,880
any of those guys that are just
constantly turning out new stuff,

1014
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,490
constantly working out,
putting on stuff that made me feel good

1015
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:45,320
a few weeks ago when you were in because
I hear you.

1016
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,380
I hear you laughing.
I heard I heard mark marin lift.

1017
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,260
He was laughing.
I was crying though.

1018
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,460
You are killing me.

1019
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,520
You went up guns blazing.
It was funny too because you were

1020
00:43:55,521 --> 00:43:59,210
falling christina and she had this bed.
I won't give away the bit but you went

1021
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:03,350
on after her mocking the premise of the
bit deeper,

1022
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,640
deeper,
deeper into it too.

1023
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:06,980
It was so preposterous.
I was fun.

1024
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,520
That fucking place is so much fun.
I like to fuck around with the other

1025
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,920
acts when they're my friends,
you know,

1026
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:16,970
that's the one thing I used to like in
the old lift factory days when brian was

1027
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:20,120
still coming in there and,
and kristala was new and we'd get up in

1028
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:22,760
the balcony and just harass each other.
Yeah,

1029
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,570
that was fun man.
I haven't been back to the laugh factory

1030
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,200
except for your shows and a long time,
but I did a show there the other night

1031
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,320
on a.
He did a benefit or something like that.

1032
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,860
on what day was it?
Tuesday.

1033
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,240
Tuesday.
Um,

1034
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,240
but damn it was good.
Cool crowd was on fire,

1035
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:42,990
man.
Yeah,

1036
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:46,140
I did one other set there to,
for another guy.

1037
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,520
I did the John Henson show and then I
did like a wednesday night.

1038
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,230
That was,
it was packed.

1039
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,910
It was great.
So they have a good room in vegas for

1040
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:57,410
first time I heard,
but brad garrets,

1041
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,900
they say it's better the brad garret
room with the mgm parents,

1042
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,960
but political reasons I don't want to
make a choice but like what you're doing

1043
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:06,060
there,
but I will just nod your head to the

1044
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:11,061
left if you think brad gets better or to
look to look at him.

1045
00:45:11,681 --> 00:45:12,514
Big folks.
Good.

1046
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,520
YeAh.
But the brad garrett one.

1047
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,470
I've yet to be while you have to walk
inside,

1048
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:19,920
either one of them is beautiful.
We've got to organize a time where we're

1049
00:45:19,921 --> 00:45:21,380
both in vegas at the same time.

1050
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Know I love that.
How often do you do that room?

1051
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,950
Uh,
I'm doing it in july.

1052
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:28,920
I'm doing brad's in june.
What time's your show when you do it

1053
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,740
there?
Brad is only one show.

1054
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:33,180
I think it's at nine.
At nine.

1055
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:34,530
Well,
if that's the case,

1056
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,190
you could go to the ufc and still make
it to your show.

1057
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:43,590
Go to the ufc and just leave at eight.
I had so much fun and especially one of

1058
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:46,920
the most compelling sam's they've ever
heard of emotion.

1059
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:52,180
Was that when in montreal when you
invited tammy and I there that was made.

1060
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,870
I forget the guy's name.
Very french name.

1061
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,063
George.
St pierre.

1062
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,190
Yeah man.
Was that fun you got there just in time

1063
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:00,630
for that?
I was so glad he won.

1064
00:46:00,631 --> 00:46:03,210
It would have been such a bummer with
that crowd like that,

1065
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:04,170
you know?
Yeah,

1066
00:46:04,171 --> 00:46:07,680
man in montreal and then I'm in toronto.

1067
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,650
Toronto is the biggest crowd we've ever
had before.

1068
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:14,480
Australia for ufc event which you go,
it shows you a.

1069
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,210
Well we've had them in sydney,
but the most recent one was in melbourne

1070
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,940
and it was this giant arena that was
huge.

1071
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,950
It was more than 60,000,
so it was more than the rogers pLace in.

1072
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,230
Was it rod laver?
What's up?

1073
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:30,420
Rod labor.
The tennis guy.

1074
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:32,840
But he has his own.
Uh,

1075
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,700
it's like a stadium.
Could be,

1076
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,500
could be.
I don't remember.

1077
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,410
I don't know that I don't paying
attention to the name of the place,

1078
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,720
but it was awesome.
I love melbourne,

1079
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,990
melbourne.
It's amazing what a goddamn city.

1080
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:49,200
The and the restaurants are so good and
people aren't really smart too.

1081
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:50,730
It's like someone described it,
bath.

1082
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,610
They said it's like a san francisco of
Australia.

1083
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,230
Yeah.
So it kind of feels like it is.

1084
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,064
Yeah.

1085
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:57,480
Yeah.
I love it there man.

1086
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,380
That's one place outside of America.
Other than like vancouver or toronto or

1087
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:02,490
montreal where you go,
oh,

1088
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:04,800
I could live here.
montreal is cold as fuck.

1089
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:06,510
So it was toronto in the winter,
but yeah,

1090
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,300
the people are so nice.
It seems like it's almost worth the

1091
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:10,440
trade off.
you know,

1092
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,790
Australia,
they're happy.

1093
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:16,710
I think part of it is like they're so
far away from all the trouble.

1094
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,450
I mean,
even if you invaded them,

1095
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:21,450
you'd have to stop to refuel.
So ridiculously for.

1096
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:23,640
That's a good point.
None amazing.

1097
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,260
He took an island and they filled it up
with criminals and it became an awesome

1098
00:47:28,261 --> 00:47:29,094
country.
Yeah.

1099
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,550
Then they got some really good lawyers
because the in the aborigines cut a

1100
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,680
really bad deal for the rate for the
aborigines.

1101
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,290
Well,
he will give me all this shit spots in

1102
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:39,970
the middle of nothing.
Barren land.

1103
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,100
It will take the beaches and the clips.
Yeah.

1104
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:45,220
We'll take all the beautiful area and
you guys can have where the spiders

1105
00:47:45,221 --> 00:47:46,570
live.
Exactly.

1106
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,580
Yeah.
That is definitely a shit deal.

1107
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,230
It's just a strange a society.
There's 20 million people in the entire

1108
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:57,700
island and the island where there's more
people in California are just as many.

1109
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:58,781
Yeah.
I want.

1110
00:47:58,781 --> 00:48:00,910
I go.
One of the things that's cool about that

1111
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,160
is like your own.
When that door opens,

1112
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:05,560
you're in a different world.
The trees are different.

1113
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:07,420
Everything's dip.
I'm going into fall,

1114
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:08,630
you know,
it's,

1115
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,050
it's kind of cool.
Have you ever gone to africa?

1116
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,230
No.
I've been thinking about going on one of

1117
00:48:14,231 --> 00:48:17,070
those wildlife safari in Tanzania where
you,

1118
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,920
as long as I know that it's in some sort
of a protected device.

1119
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,620
See,
I don't go to any place where you've got

1120
00:48:22,621 --> 00:48:25,310
to get needles to go to.
Do you have to go to get needles before

1121
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,550
Tanzania?
You don't have to get needles for south

1122
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:31,920
afriCa and I don't know.
Mom was positive.

1123
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:32,380
You don't.

1124
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:36,010
so they have some places in africa we
have to get needles and you have to get

1125
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:38,440
malaria shots and all that.
I think Tanzania is one of them.

1126
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:40,900
I would bet that in Zimbabwe.
Where should I go?

1127
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,520
Where's the spot?
I just want to.

1128
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,720
I think it would be cool to be
somewhere.

1129
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:49,540
I just don't like those open jeeps,
man.

1130
00:48:49,541 --> 00:48:53,080
I don't trust those things I've seen.
I've seen people use those things.

1131
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,140
They say the cats don't jump inside.
It's safe and he totally do it,

1132
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,050
but bullshit man,
we never did before.

1133
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,100
yeah,
exactly.

1134
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:02,050
I mean,
I guess they do it every day and they

1135
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:03,160
know,
you know,

1136
00:49:03,161 --> 00:49:07,720
I guess it's probably saved 90 percent
of the time or 99 percent of the time,

1137
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,000
but if I could be in something where I
knew that it was completely like closed

1138
00:49:13,001 --> 00:49:15,820
off to the outside world,
you can move around amongst them.

1139
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,760
I Would tell you that went to Australia
and they had.

1140
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:21,840
I thought I was going to see kangaroos
and all this,

1141
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,100
you know,
wallabies,

1142
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:25,330
as the guy says,
you want some food?

1143
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:25,790
I go,
yeah,

1144
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,201
I thought,
you know,

1145
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:29,170
you throw the food at the animals and
they're all happy that you go in there

1146
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:30,800
with them.
Right?

1147
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,020
You're right there.
They're just like,

1148
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,060
there.
You feed them fucking kangaroos when

1149
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:35,560
they get up there pretty big,
you know,

1150
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,530
if they want kick you and fuck you up,
break your back.

1151
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,300
And I had the punch and emo in the neck.
Oh,

1152
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:45,070
but it was bothering.
Sophia kept nipping at,

1153
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:49,510
or when I hit that motherfucker,
it was very funny because you hear it

1154
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,930
was when I hit him,
I really clocked him and

1155
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,760
as he ran away,
but I didn't know that you just walked

1156
00:49:57,761 --> 00:49:59,800
in with the animals.
Those are dinosaurs,

1157
00:49:59,801 --> 00:50:00,910
man.
Oh yeah.

1158
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:01,960
They are.
You know,

1159
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,720
they think that a good percentage of
dinosaurs had feathers now

1160
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:11,290
revamp their opinion.
Apparently there's a natural hIstory

1161
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:15,520
museum now that actually has,
I think it's in New York that actually

1162
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:20,521
has a model of a tyrannosaurus with
feathers all over it because they think

1163
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,880
it might be what it looked like.
See if you find that jamie,

1164
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,930
which kind of makes sense if you think
about them,

1165
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,340
mean look,
we see turkeys,

1166
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,820
we see these bIg ostriches and he moves
and all these fucking weird giant birds.

1167
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,110
Eagles.
They're all dinosaurs and they're

1168
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:41,550
covered with feathers.
There's.

1169
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,560
I'm a natural history museum in New York
city model something New York city model

1170
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,320
t rex feathers because they actually
have like a life size trx or a model of

1171
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:57,000
tiera.
Large model of tiera might not be life

1172
00:50:57,001 --> 00:50:58,730
size,
but It's got feathers all over it.

1173
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,880
I'm want to say that it's.
Yeah,

1174
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,980
they're starting to think that now.
Starting to think that maybe a lot of

1175
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,730
them had feathers.

1176
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,070
So how we would send the of the ocean or
we'd descend this,

1177
00:51:08,071 --> 00:51:10,250
the land us.
Well,

1178
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:11,990
it's all comes from the original
sources.

1179
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,530
Most likely the ocean.
They think that all that life came from

1180
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,060
moisture.
Right.

1181
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:21,350
In some,
some weird interaction with proteins and

1182
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:22,580
amino acids.
That radiation.

1183
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:23,690
There it is.
Look at that picture.

1184
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:25,570
Dom,
how crazy is that shit?

1185
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:31,090
What a insane photograph.
But that is Just insane.

1186
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,160
So this,
they think this might be with t rex

1187
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:35,570
looks like if you find it,
it's,

1188
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:41,090
it looks like the craziest bird ever.
Like a,

1189
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:46,550
just a demonic bird and it looks fucking
terrifying.

1190
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,030
Kinda looks like hair tonight.
We'll just like feathers.

1191
00:51:50,031 --> 00:51:50,864
But you're.
Well,

1192
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,390
you know there were non flight feathers,
you know

1193
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,260
like some birds have different kinds of
feathers.

1194
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,350
They,
they know that there was these things

1195
00:52:00,351 --> 00:52:04,580
called terror birds that lived in north
America that were enormous.

1196
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,690
They were like nine feet tall birds that
didn't live that long ago,

1197
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:11,060
I want to say they lived like a million
years ago.

1198
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,370
that's another one.
Another different example of.

1199
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,200
That's like a more conservative estimate
of what the feathers looked light,

1200
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:24,190
but there's these comparisons of terror
birds and they put them alongside human

1201
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:29,030
beings and they lived right here to
lived in north America where they don't

1202
00:52:29,031 --> 00:52:30,410
have any fossils of them.
They do.

1203
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,310
They do have fossils of them and there
were these enormous like nine foot tall

1204
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:38,780
birds but it didn't fly and they just
jacked things,

1205
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,870
killed things,
but they had beaks like a bird,

1206
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,790
you know,
so because they have beaks like a bird,

1207
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:47,390
we look at that particular type of.
Have a look at that thing.

1208
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,520
That's what these things look like.
I mean these were real animals.

1209
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,990
The,
the image that we're looking at as a

1210
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,290
drawing,
an artist's rendition of a man looks

1211
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:01,550
like a six foot tall man standing next
to a volkswagen with these things

1212
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:04,400
towering above him.
And you get to see how big these

1213
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,950
failures there were.
So big.

1214
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,030
This one is three meters tall.
So that's nine feet tall.

1215
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,680
Fuck you.

1216
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,480
Milligrams 400 kilos.
Thousand pounds.

1217
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:21,500
Fifty cm centimeters.
Oh,

1218
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,950
because this is awesome.
A different countrY where they speak

1219
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:29,490
some heathen language.
They're called the metric system.

1220
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:33,000
That doesn't seem right.
Fifty centimeters.

1221
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,640
That's not that very.
They tried to pull it on us,

1222
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:39,180
but we were two point three meters.
Four hundred kilograms.

1223
00:53:39,330 --> 00:53:41,550
He's 50 centimeters the man.
No,

1224
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,530
that can't be right.
Is that the man is out there?

1225
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,860
Is that the.
No.

1226
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,933
What does that mean?

1227
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:51,980
Hmm?

1228
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,390
Yeah.
That can be 50 centimeters.

1229
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:55,100
Centimeters like an inch.
It's less than niche,

1230
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,260
isn't it?
To be really short guy.

1231
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:00,360
He'd be a tiny bit below that.
Look,

1232
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,640
I'll tell you,
compared to a beatles,

1233
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:02,990
beatles,
not very tall.

1234
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:07,550
So maybe he has a short guy maybe,
but put is 50 centimeters as far as.

1235
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,710
Because 50 centimeters is above his
head.

1236
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,740
I mean as possible.
These two short guides to make a point,

1237
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:14,570
but.
Well yeah.

1238
00:54:14,571 --> 00:54:16,460
You know what?
He looks short because look,

1239
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,950
if it's nine feet tall,
it's only double his size.

1240
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:21,470
He four and a half feet tall.
Is that a child?

1241
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,880
Are they playing with our emotions here?
The fuck is going on.

1242
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,380
My point being that fucking thing was
alive.

1243
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,930
Fiftieth centimeters is less than two
feet.

1244
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:34,490
It's only 20 inches.
A little dude.

1245
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:36,590
That's not right because the,
the,

1246
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:38,720
the um,
vw bugs,

1247
00:54:38,721 --> 00:54:43,520
definitely taller than that picture.
But what year did these things exist?

1248
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:47,910
These terrible words.
Does it say what year?

1249
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,290
What a fucking weird world we have as
far as the biological diversity,

1250
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:58,080
you know,
that this is all new to me that we had

1251
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,240
these.
I thought we were set on what the

1252
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:02,160
dinosaurs looked like by their bone
structure.

1253
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:05,460
This is not a dinosaur.
This is one point 8 million years ago

1254
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:09,000
from 62 to one point 8 million years
ago.

1255
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:15,470
So if it's from 62 to one point eight,
what does that new findings dating them

1256
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:19,080
to?
Four hundred 50,000 and 17,000 years ago

1257
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,800
would imply that some.
Wow,

1258
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:27,690
how do you say that word for us?
Fat for us.

1259
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,650
Raw saids forest acids,
forest ras.

1260
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:36,651
it's survived there until recently.
I the late pleistocene.

1261
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,020
but this,
this claim is debated.

1262
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,560
So it's possible that it was 17,000
years ago,

1263
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:49,010
it's likely that it's somewhere between
that and one point 8 million years ago,

1264
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:52,860
which is like way later than dinosaurs.

1265
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:56,430
The dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
So the oldest date,

1266
00:55:56,431 --> 00:56:00,030
they have a 62 million years,
so it's 3 million years newer than the

1267
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:02,640
dinosaurs died.
These monster,

1268
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:05,220
as birds survive that impact.
That's what they are.

1269
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:09,710
They're fucking beasts.
What do you think it hit where they

1270
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,660
think it hit the yucatan?
The one that killed the dinosaurs?

1271
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:16,080
they pretty much know where it hit.
They have this whole push out of the

1272
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,730
orbit a little.
Well,

1273
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:20,280
they think it did something to the
atmosphere for sure.

1274
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,980
They think it rained lava like literally
rained lava.

1275
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:28,720
They think the impact from it clouded
the sky and cause nuclear winter.

1276
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:32,180
I mean the impact had the,
the,

1277
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,570
the actual sphere,
the globe.

1278
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,580
The earth itself was ringing a bell for
like years.

1279
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,860
Look at that.
That's the area.

1280
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:49,090
That's the area where it hit
is what?

1281
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,830
Just imagine how big that that means.
That 65 million years ago,

1282
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,040
that thing hit and everything started
from scratch.

1283
00:56:58,041 --> 00:57:02,810
The whole world got a whole new order.
Everything's different and that can

1284
00:57:02,811 --> 00:57:05,660
happen at anytime.
Not only can it happen at anytime,

1285
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,020
it's most likely going to happen.
That's why we should ever get too cocky.

1286
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,280
Never get too cocky.

1287
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:13,920
You gotta take a leak.
what does that,

1288
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,343
what are you showing me?

1289
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,233
Uh,

1290
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:21,600
we'll figure it out.
Alright.

1291
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,750
Relax.
Dominic.

1292
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,790
Area with secret information that he
wrote down.

1293
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,310
I had to read his handwriting.
Sorry.

1294
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,320
How long before people don't write
things anymore,

1295
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:37,150
but we write that.
We wrote those notes.

1296
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:38,740
People still write little notes.
Yeah.

1297
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:40,360
Well we,
we still text.

1298
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,540
Yeah.
It's like we like going to a place when

1299
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:46,540
we see a chalkboard and the menus
written in chocolate.

1300
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,400
Oh,
They wrote it themselves.

1301
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,050
Well,
they don't teach cursive anymore.

1302
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:51,480
No.
You know you shouldn't.

1303
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:54,010
Did you learn that a.
Yeah.

1304
00:57:54,011 --> 00:57:56,050
And catholic to catholic grade school?
No.

1305
00:57:56,051 --> 00:57:58,160
I went to catholic.
I went to first grade catholic school

1306
00:57:58,161 --> 00:58:01,390
and then the public school after that.
But this was in New York though?

1307
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,170
No,
no.

1308
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:06,460
I went New Jersey catholic school and
then san francisco puBlic school after

1309
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:09,370
that.
Then Florida than boston.

1310
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:11,800
We're in Florida,
gaInesville.

1311
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,220
Wow.
That'd be tough.

1312
00:58:15,221 --> 00:58:16,870
I'd meet you.
I learned something new.

1313
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,610
That was when,
when I was a kid,

1314
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:22,750
alligators were endangered and we would
go to this place called lake alice in

1315
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:25,120
gainesville.
We'd feed the alligators marshmallows

1316
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,460
and it was weird,
man.

1317
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,830
It just didn't worry aBout allIgators.
they were around,

1318
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:31,540
there were always around and they really
didn't bother.

1319
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:34,840
People know they don't,
but there's just this agreement with

1320
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:36,940
people in algiers for whatever fucking
stranger.

1321
00:58:36,941 --> 00:58:38,050
He.
It didn't make any sense.

1322
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:42,100
It was almost like evolutionarily it was
a bad idea for them to fuck with people,

1323
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,050
so they Just don't bother me.
I don't bother you,

1324
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,000
but they woulD occasionally jack
someone's dog.

1325
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,360
And when I lived there,
this lady got her poodle snap right off

1326
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:53,500
of her chain.
She was walking by the lady and this

1327
00:58:53,501 --> 00:58:58,501
thing just came out.
You see the video I posted on my,

1328
00:58:58,511 --> 00:58:59,730
uh,
uh,

1329
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,560
twitter today.
Some dude send it to me and I retweeted

1330
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:03,670
it.
It's,

1331
00:59:03,671 --> 00:59:06,760
um,
this guy's cat fishing and he's a,

1332
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:09,250
he's got these lines set out and you
know,

1333
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:09,780
you,
you,

1334
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,500
you have a or it's floating in the
middle of the lake,

1335
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:13,690
a big heavy barbara.
And when you catch catfish,

1336
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:15,640
he just see the bobber move it around.
So you know,

1337
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:17,670
you got one.
So it goes over to the bobber.

1338
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,371
Check this out,
don,

1339
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:19,960
look at it.
He pulls it up.

1340
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,650
Give us some volume here,
jamie.

1341
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:24,080
We've got a garbage

1342
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,280
because he knew it was big.
He thought it was a gar.

1343
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,133
Watch this.

1344
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:35,810
Oh my god.
His legs.

1345
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:42,080
Just like a little kid.
Always crying like,

1346
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:45,890
yeah,
of course the kid's crying most.

1347
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,070
Get eaten by a dinosaur.
It's calling for mommy.

1348
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,273
You can kill it.
Kill the.

1349
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,270
That's insane.
Fuck all that.

1350
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:55,710
Look at when it comes up,
watch this.

1351
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:58,230
Oh jesus christ.
It's like a horror movie.

1352
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:04,500
Seeing that thing in that mouth come up.
I was in Costa Rica and I saw some

1353
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,570
crocodiles in the wild.
We went on this tour.

1354
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,370
He'd get in a boat.
Ooh jesus.

1355
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:13,080
You get in a boat and you see these
crocodiles like lounging themselves on

1356
01:00:13,081 --> 01:00:14,850
the border,
on the banks of water,

1357
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,420
and then when you're passing by,
they just run and slither into the water

1358
01:00:18,421 --> 01:00:20,820
and go under the brown water and you
can't find them.

1359
01:00:20,821 --> 01:00:22,950
You don't know where the fuck they are.
It is.

1360
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:24,980
So eerie.
What's the difference between the.

1361
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,210
An alligator crocodile is a way more
aggressive.

1362
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,070
Way more aggressive.
Yeah.

1363
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:32,400
Those are smaller crocodiles because
they're south american crocodiles.

1364
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,310
They're not like nile crocodile.
So there were nile crocodiles.

1365
01:00:35,311 --> 01:00:36,990
You wouldn't even want to be in a boat
now.

1366
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:38,640
You definitely wouldn't want to be in
one of those boats.

1367
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,380
They'll knock it over now.
They'll fuck you up.

1368
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:41,550
There was a,
um,

1369
01:00:42,450 --> 01:00:46,890
I forget what nature magazine,
like national geographic or one of those

1370
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,700
types of magazines that had a story
about these kayakers that we're,

1371
01:00:50,701 --> 01:00:54,780
uh,
going down a river in the Congo,

1372
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:59,400
I forget what river it was,
but they were going down this river and

1373
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:04,140
this one guy was behind this other guy
in a kayak and you watched the app.

1374
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,600
The croc come up,
snap a whole of its jaws,

1375
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:13,680
snap as jaws down in the kayak and then
pull it under like a bobber and flipped

1376
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:16,170
it over and he watched it.
Yeah,

1377
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:17,670
there it is.
Kayaker,

1378
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:21,540
kayakers recount deadly Congo crocodile
attack.

1379
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:26,930
So he flipped over the kayak and then
the kayaks bouncing up and down because

1380
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:32,130
the croc is pulling this guy's body out
of the harness,

1381
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,390
pulling them into the water underneath
it and he's this guy behind him is

1382
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:40,410
watching this and he's seen the blood in
the water and all The bubbles in this

1383
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,760
big myth,
this hundred million year old behemoTh.

1384
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:51,600
It's clamped
down on this guy's flash and it's

1385
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:53,890
tearing it apart right in front of you
cgm.

1386
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:56,820
That's what makes you so much more a
remand to me.

1387
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,440
Like stuff like the,
the.

1388
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:00,570
You would even entertain the thought of
going there.

1389
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:01,680
Like,
you know,

1390
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,160
I want to see it.
I want to see it before I want to see

1391
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:05,220
it.
Just like from here.

1392
01:02:05,490 --> 01:02:07,770
I used to think that too.
I used to think that too,

1393
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:09,510
but lately I've wanted to see it.
Man,

1394
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:11,160
you know,
with all this talk of like they're

1395
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:14,970
killing rhinos and killing elephants and
there was this thing today where they

1396
01:02:14,971 --> 01:02:18,560
are having a gun down these lions and
dim bob way because they're not

1397
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:21,450
nonliving come there anymore.
Like they don't have anybody to manage

1398
01:02:21,451 --> 01:02:24,300
the population and these lions are
devastating there undulates,

1399
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,490
although the antelopes and all that
shit.

1400
01:02:26,491 --> 01:02:28,330
So there are these,
these hunters are,

1401
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:29,430
um,
they're hiring these,

1402
01:02:29,431 --> 01:02:32,130
what they in africa,
they call them professional hunters.

1403
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:36,570
They're like guides and he's just people
that are hired by the government and

1404
01:02:36,571 --> 01:02:38,340
they're going in there and they had to
kill some lions,

1405
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,490
had killed lions that were encroaching
on people's property and killing

1406
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:45,360
livestock and threatening people.
IT's just so weird.

1407
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:48,000
I remember that discussion you had with
jenn that night in the bar.

1408
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,640
Yeah.
Killing deer and hill,

1409
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,560
you'd have to kill some where they'd all
be dead.

1410
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:54,780
Well,
we talked about it here on the podcast

1411
01:02:54,781 --> 01:02:55,614
yesterday.
I,

1412
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,900
John Dudley was here and we found a
statistic that's unbelievably insane.

1413
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:04,590
And that statistic is,
there's one point $5 million car

1414
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:07,750
accidents a year where people hit deer
in America.

1415
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,170
Uh,
just in America we knew that it was

1416
01:03:10,171 --> 01:03:12,600
50,000 in Michigan where like how crazy
is that?

1417
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,310
But then we found out about the whole
country.

1418
01:03:14,311 --> 01:03:15,960
We were lIke,
holy shit,

1419
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,720
that's amazing.
And when my friend john lives like him

1420
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:20,430
and his wife,
when they have conversations on the

1421
01:03:20,431 --> 01:03:22,320
phone,
it's always like,

1422
01:03:22,321 --> 01:03:24,330
as they're talking about their drive
home from work,

1423
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:24,991
it's always,
yeah,

1424
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:25,980
we almost hit a deer.

1425
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,680
I saw a deer.
We saw five deer.

1426
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:31,800
So I drive slow.
And what's the who you can they also

1427
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:35,610
have these little whistles that you put
on the front of your car that lets the

1428
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:36,091
deer?
No,

1429
01:03:36,091 --> 01:03:37,980
your comment and the deer were generally
get out of the way.

1430
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:41,490
It's like a high pissed pitched whistle
that only like the deer can here.

1431
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,790
And then also a lot of guys they say,
well I'm just going to get a battering

1432
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:48,240
ram and the front of my truck.
So what they do is they get these deer

1433
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:52,530
guards and they put them on semis in
particular because there's places where

1434
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:55,970
truckers are hauling goods in the middle
of the night.

1435
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:58,050
Even the day doesn't even have to be in
the middle of the night,

1436
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,830
but they'll run into a truck and that
truck will get crippled by a deer.

1437
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:06,660
The deer will go into the gearing into
the engine bay and just destroy

1438
01:04:06,661 --> 01:04:08,220
everything,
tear out the radiator,

1439
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:13,460
so they had to develop these gigantic,
like mad max style bumpers that they put

1440
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:19,590
on the front of these semis just to
protect the truck itself from fucking

1441
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:24,710
killing things like deer slamming into
it and a lot of people get killed to 200

1442
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:26,030
a year.

1443
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,060
We'Ll look at this.
Look at this.

1444
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,540
We have this fucking picture.
We're looking at this picture of,

1445
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:35,541
this guy's got this gigantic metal
barrier in the front of his truck and

1446
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:39,210
his deer just went into it,
crushed it,

1447
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:42,690
crushed it,
and it spray painted the side of the

1448
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:46,920
truck red all the way up to the
windshield and the deer psych hanging

1449
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,650
from the front bumper.
Fuck man.

1450
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,450
I look at those things that they may
look at that one,

1451
01:04:51,451 --> 01:04:52,740
that you're hovering over it.
Click on it.

1452
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:55,080
Look at the size of that thing.
I mean,

1453
01:04:55,081 --> 01:05:00,000
it's like you're driving around a non
aerodynamic battering ram Just to

1454
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:05,001
protect your car from slamming into
animals.

1455
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,500
Look at that.
That's crazy.

1456
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,610
Wow.
They Do unbelievable damage when you're

1457
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:15,500
hitting a hundred 50 pound animal and
you're going 70 miles an hour.

1458
01:05:15,501 --> 01:05:16,770
Like,
look at that one with the cars.

1459
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,500
Get the deer hanging out of the front
like it's inside the engine.

1460
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:22,510
Geez.
Yeah.

1461
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,430
They just.
And that's if you're lucky,

1462
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:28,180
if you're unlucky that go inside your
front windshield.

1463
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,690
My friend cam,
he lives up in Oregon and a guy in front

1464
01:05:31,691 --> 01:05:33,220
of them,
not in front of him,

1465
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:37,840
but this guy died because the man in
front of him hit a deer.

1466
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:42,550
The deer went flying over that person's
hood and through his windshield and kill

1467
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:43,510
them.
Oh shit.

1468
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:45,160
Yeah.
Look at that.

1469
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:48,060
Just fucking blood and gore.
Alright.

1470
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,360
Jamie bumming me out,
man.

1471
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,750
It's a deer in the front seat.
There's a lot of them.

1472
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,710
She's,
you know,

1473
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,800
she's a loving person,
you know,

1474
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,180
that's why she has this distorted
perception of it.

1475
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:59,590
She's a loving,
loving,

1476
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,960
forgetting.
She says one of these animals to die.

1477
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,330
I get it.
Nobody wants him to die.

1478
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,330
That's the thing about this world that
we live in.

1479
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,120
It's very ambiguous and a lot of ways.
There's a lot of.

1480
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:15,190
There's not a clear right and a wrong.
There's a lot of things that seem like

1481
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,710
they're wrong,
but if you don't do them,

1482
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:21,520
everything's going to be way worse,
and one of those things is killing

1483
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:24,880
beautiful animals.
It seems like it's wrong to kill deer.

1484
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,550
If you don't kill deer,
it's way world.

1485
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,390
They're fucked and then we're fucked and
there's going to be diseases and there's

1486
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:34,090
going to be a lot of problems is also
going to be a lot of predators.

1487
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,480
If you have a surplus of deer nature
finds a balance.

1488
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,120
If you have a surplus of deer and
there's any predators in the area,

1489
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:43,000
you're going to get a surplus of those
predators because it was predator is

1490
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:44,770
going to have way more food.
They're going to thrive.

1491
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:46,480
They're going to breed,
so they ain't going to have to figure

1492
01:06:46,481 --> 01:06:49,450
out how to manage not Just the deer,
but you're also going to have to manage

1493
01:06:49,451 --> 01:06:51,370
the predator population,
so you're just going to have to.

1494
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:52,810
And if you don't,
you don't do it.

1495
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:54,250
You've got real problems.
Yeah.

1496
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:57,460
That's an 18 foot long alligator.
They shot what?

1497
01:06:57,610 --> 01:06:59,620
Killing cattle.
You know what?

1498
01:06:59,770 --> 01:07:03,340
This was in Florida,
what he was killing cows.

1499
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:07,420
Jesus christ.
Look at that thing.

1500
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,870
So this is predator control and we don't
have that much of a problem with this

1501
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:13,600
kind of predator control because it's a
fucking heartless,

1502
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,480
cold blooded monster by the way.
We were trying.

1503
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:18,400
We still retarded.
We're trying to figure out what the

1504
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:21,190
difference between a.
How can a komodo dragon to be the

1505
01:07:21,191 --> 01:07:24,790
biggest lizard and a crocodiles.
Not because it's bigger.

1506
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:25,990
Crocodiles,
a reptile.

1507
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:31,570
That's how stupid we are is different.
It's different because lizards,

1508
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,430
there's reptiles,
google it.

1509
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,190
Some people are tweeting me,
man.

1510
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,070
That's the extent I researched it.
Yeah.

1511
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,373
Reptiles,
bro.

1512
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:46,060
Get together.
Bitch lizards are widespread group of

1513
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,380
squats.
Guamate reptiles.

1514
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:51,420
But a crocodiles,
not a lizard is a reptile to different

1515
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:52,240
kinds of.
Yes,

1516
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,330
exactly right.
Sort of like we're apes,

1517
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:57,700
but we're not monkeys or apes.
No.

1518
01:07:57,701 --> 01:07:59,350
All monkeys or apes.
But not all.

1519
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,980
All apes or monkeys?
Yeah.

1520
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:04,930
Yeah.
All monkeys or apes.

1521
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:07,650
But not all apes or monkeys that,
right?

1522
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:10,450
No,
all apes or monkeys,

1523
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:13,630
but not all monkeys or apes.
I think that's it.

1524
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,130
Some of them are simeon's.
Like an ape

1525
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,270
is different.
Right.

1526
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,480
Apes or chimps and gorillas and
orangutans and us.

1527
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:21,500
Right.
And baboons,

1528
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,150
ms dot babylonian.
All mammals.

1529
01:08:23,151 --> 01:08:24,860
But we're not all the same kind of
mammal.

1530
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,400
Exactly.
Fish or are like seeing marsupial's,

1531
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,090
which is a whole different world.
The ubc and the people,

1532
01:08:31,091 --> 01:08:34,790
it's a pouch is hardier.
Like there was an article recently that

1533
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:39,680
this guy wrote the saying that the word
monkey isn't like people criticized the

1534
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,540
word monkey.
This is not the correct word to use.

1535
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:44,150
And he said that's not true.
Not only is it not true,

1536
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:45,800
all,
all apes or monkeys,

1537
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:47,540
but not all monkeys or apes.
That was,

1538
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:52,541
I think the title of this guy's paper
was really interesting because I always

1539
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:55,100
thought that the word monkey was like
almost like a slang.

1540
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,303
Apparently.
It's not.

1541
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:58,310
Know the difference.
Can actually use that word.

1542
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:01,670
Yeah.
There's just a different species of

1543
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:04,990
monkeys
in your.

1544
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,800
You're a monkey.
I about that.

1545
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,200
Hey,
fuck you joe.

1546
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,330
You bullshit.
Need this.

1547
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:15,570
I really dove in head first class.
Abc paid for it.

1548
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,700
I'll get you to cookie rich.
We're talking about our pals.

1549
01:09:19,710 --> 01:09:22,610
She,
steve sherpa was podcast started who was

1550
01:09:22,611 --> 01:09:25,430
in the sopranos and he's gonna be.
He's awesome.

1551
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,090
He's going to be in the podcast.
I'm within like two weeks.

1552
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:33,450
It will listen up to kill.
He's funny when he's trying to be funny.

1553
01:09:33,451 --> 01:09:36,530
He's funnier when he's serious.
He was bobby on the soprano's,

1554
01:09:36,531 --> 01:09:37,870
the big guy.
Bobby,

1555
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,290
right?
That was his character and his problems.

1556
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:40,303
I think so,
yeah.

1557
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:45,320
He was married to a lead sister.
Yes.

1558
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:47,710
Tony soprano.
Yeah.

1559
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:50,870
She go again to fini.
The fini comes up to me.

1560
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:54,980
I was with steve at the hard rock
because I think he had the wrong guy.

1561
01:09:54,981 --> 01:09:57,020
He goes,
he kisses me,

1562
01:09:57,310 --> 01:09:59,080
kisses me on the cheek,
kiss me on the cheek.

1563
01:09:59,090 --> 01:09:59,571
He said,
man,

1564
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,240
I saw you on broadway.
I fucking loved you thinking,

1565
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:03,830
what the fuck,
bro would I ever do?

1566
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,960
Were you on broadway ever Just hanging
out?

1567
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:07,013
Well,
I mean

1568
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,280
cruising for.
I looked.

1569
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:13,700
I saw the clothes.
I think unless I was at caroline's,

1570
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,300
I liked the cut of your jib.
Was Caroline's on broadway,

1571
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:20,590
but I mean probably where he saw you.
People don't usually call that broadway

1572
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:24,010
the nun comic group.
They don't know the lender it.

1573
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,690
They all know the verbiage.
They don't.

1574
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,790
They don't know of vernacular.
Dominic,

1575
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:29,990
do you go into New York at all?
You do theaters?

1576
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:32,870
Yeah.
Next time I go,

1577
01:10:32,871 --> 01:10:35,900
I want to do a club though.
I think I love the beacon theater.

1578
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,100
I had a great time the last time.
I love governors.

1579
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,910
Governors is great openers in the
brokerage and.

1580
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,460
But I want to do a gotham.

1581
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,290
I haven't done gotham and forever.
Yeah,

1582
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:47,540
I did a tv show there last year,
but I haven't done stand up.

1583
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:48,980
Different motherfucker.
Great club.

1584
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:51,800
I heard the stands great to now.
I didn't know that one.

1585
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,390
Yeah,
I heard it's great,

1586
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,420
but my problem is always going there for
ufc and comedy.

1587
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:58,070
Like I don't have enough time to hang
around.

1588
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:00,350
That's a good problem.
It's not a bad problem,

1589
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:02,330
but don't have enough time to hang
around.

1590
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:03,130
You know,
it's,

1591
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,720
it's uh,
there's an interesting scene in New

1592
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,380
York,
you know,

1593
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,180
there's a bunch of different factions of
the scene.

1594
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,450
There's even a weird scene in brooklyn,
you know,

1595
01:11:11,490 --> 01:11:15,840
so they had to out a lot of weirdness
but interesting.

1596
01:11:15,841 --> 01:11:18,960
It's like there's a lot of bubbling
creativity and people trying to find

1597
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:20,940
their niche right now.
There's all these different people kind

1598
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:25,941
of scrambling to find their niche in the
world of comedy and when you look at the

1599
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:28,830
different communities that develop in
different parts of the country,

1600
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:30,570
it's interesting to see the different
styles.

1601
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:33,620
You know,
the people as the young comics sq.

1602
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,430
Like how you made it.
No,

1603
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,280
it's good.
I always get to it.

1604
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:40,950
So open ended,
but I always get asked how do you get

1605
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,720
certain things,
you know,

1606
01:11:42,770 --> 01:11:46,670
like the thing I've gotten,
I've lost my patience with some.

1607
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:49,030
Some people like looking for an easy way
out,

1608
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,570
you know,
you get it because people ask for you to

1609
01:11:53,571 --> 01:11:53,820
go.
Yeah.

1610
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,620
Like they,
they always think like this club owner

1611
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:57,090
hates them or this shit.
I said,

1612
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:57,720
know,
fuck it.

1613
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,070
Hey,
he's trying to pay his bills.

1614
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,840
I don't even think of a.
Well,

1615
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:04,050
there's some,
there's some legitimate questions that

1616
01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:06,840
young comics was like,
how does one go about getting a manager

1617
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,030
to get an agent?
All that kind of stuff.

1618
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:12,600
That's good.
And it's good for us to give advice to

1619
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:15,870
young comics saying,
do not get a manager because it's the

1620
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:19,340
first manager that asks you because
there's a lot of people that are going

1621
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:21,960
to be the first manager that asks you to
manage them and they might not be right

1622
01:12:21,961 --> 01:12:22,790
for you.

1623
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:25,490
That's why you look at a lot of guys
like chapelle or you know,

1624
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:27,840
a lot of these guys that have left their
management,

1625
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,660
like they started with one guy and they
didn't want to be with them anymore and

1626
01:12:30,661 --> 01:12:32,670
they laughed and they left.
Like maybe again,

1627
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,050
maybe again,
you know,

1628
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:37,650
I know quite a few guys that chapels,
old manager we saw last week at the

1629
01:12:37,651 --> 01:12:38,500
improv.
Yes,

1630
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:39,600
yes.
Funny.

1631
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:40,980
Yeah,
there's a few.

1632
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:42,460
There's a few of those.
Um,

1633
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:46,560
it was fucking hilarious moment.
Attention because he would touch,

1634
01:12:46,561 --> 01:12:50,940
you and I were standing there and he
Just said hi to me dipped in.

1635
01:12:51,210 --> 01:12:52,200
Well,
he knows we don't like them.

1636
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,460
yeah,
yeah,

1637
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,710
well not that I hate them.
Just really,

1638
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:01,760
there's only so much hollywood a man
could take before you just screaming out

1639
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:04,860
in agony for what you have imposed upon
us.

1640
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,310
Stop.
There's a few of those guys.

1641
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:12,430
It was a funny fucking moment frozen in
time and I'll never forget the look was

1642
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,120
dipping in.
Bought a bunch of those guys,

1643
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:16,770
man,
that really shouldn't be involved in

1644
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:17,800
management.
You know,

1645
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:19,340
I had a um,
okay.

1646
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,220
Kevin james,
kevin,

1647
01:13:20,221 --> 01:13:22,980
james,
a good friend and one of his earlier

1648
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:25,650
managers was giving him fucking terrible
advice,

1649
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:29,700
including wanting them to stay fat.
Kevin was trying to be healthy.

1650
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:32,070
It was trying to Lose some weight and
the guy literally said to them,

1651
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:33,300
cover them,
if you lose weight,

1652
01:13:33,301 --> 01:13:38,250
you're gonna lose roles.
You're not going to get cast lovable fat

1653
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:40,140
guy that's paying off.
Stick with it,

1654
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:42,990
stick with it.
But that was his real statement.

1655
01:13:42,991 --> 01:13:44,760
if you lose weight,
you lose roles.

1656
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:47,760
and kevin came back to talk to me about
it and he was just really eaten up by

1657
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:48,630
it.
It was like,

1658
01:13:48,631 --> 01:13:51,510
what the fuck?
Because that's not what kevin wanted to

1659
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:54,750
hear.
Like kevin is a guy that works hard and

1660
01:13:54,751 --> 01:13:58,430
he's very smart,
but he like,

1661
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,470
if you tell him that the sky is falling,
he'll be like,

1662
01:14:01,471 --> 01:14:03,570
holy shit.
Is it showing the sky's falling?

1663
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:06,360
The sky's falling.
Like he needs encouragement.

1664
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,460
Like when he's.
He's really funny.

1665
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:10,920
When he's around his friends,
like we were talking about Joey being

1666
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:11,860
surrounded by people like

1667
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,480
kevin operates kind of in the same way.
I agree with what.

1668
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:18,340
We had a great dinner when I remember I
came to see what the poem.

1669
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

1670
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:22,810
It was fun to see him relaxed and was,
well he knows I love him,

1671
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,940
you know?
I mean that's why it was fun doing those

1672
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:27,070
movies with him.
But kevin,

1673
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,010
when you're supporting them and when,
when he's around people that support

1674
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:31,870
them,
like he can be himself and he can cut

1675
01:14:31,871 --> 01:14:33,580
louis.
when you got someone telling you,

1676
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,280
hey man,
don't get healthy because if you get

1677
01:14:36,281 --> 01:14:39,670
healthy you won't be successful.
You have to choose one or the other.

1678
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:41,140
and I go to.
That's crazy.

1679
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:44,350
think about how many people that are
funny that aren't fat telling me that

1680
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,690
it's impossible for you to be.
You're hilarious.

1681
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:47,770
His whole,
his whole,

1682
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,770
the act wasn't predicated on,
not at all,

1683
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:55,420
but he felt in some weird way that
people loved him because he was a big

1684
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:57,070
jolly guy,
you know,

1685
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,570
he's fucking talented as hell and so it
angered me.

1686
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:04,690
It angered me that someone would try to
limit him in that way,

1687
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,860
that someone would try to put him in.
But that's the problem with having a bad

1688
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:12,760
manager when you're a young guy,
when everything is just starting out and

1689
01:15:12,761 --> 01:15:15,040
you know you're in your twenties and
you're all vulnerable and you only

1690
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:18,400
started out just a few years ago and
they're still getting your feet wet and

1691
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:19,930
trying to figure out how to do this
thing.

1692
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,080
Know it's about juggling like this.
Should I go like that and you know,

1693
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:27,220
kevin would do this thing where he calls
going full shimmy and full.

1694
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:29,800
Shelia was any fucking freaked out about
something because shimmy was his

1695
01:15:29,801 --> 01:15:31,030
nickname.
We always call him shimmy.

1696
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:36,280
Yeah.
And a full shimmy would be when he would

1697
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:39,760
just go ballistic and like he would,
he would be like,

1698
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:43,330
one time we were,
we were hanging out together and I went

1699
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:45,400
with him,
he had a gig and I just went with him to

1700
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:46,780
watch,
just to laugh,

1701
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:47,650
just to sit down and laugh.

1702
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,310
And because I was there,
he was like having a great time because

1703
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:53,290
he knew he'd hear me laugh showing off
for you.

1704
01:15:53,890 --> 01:15:57,450
He said he got into it because he's,
he,

1705
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,980
I swear to god.
people don't know how good Kevin James

1706
01:15:59,981 --> 01:16:01,900
was at one,
at one point in his career.

1707
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,790
I mean I'm assuming he's just as good
now,

1708
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:05,350
but I haven't seen him do standup in a
long time.

1709
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,760
But when he would,
he was going off and,

1710
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:09,480
and he,
he,

1711
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:13,900
he like was faces red.
It was spitting and it was just going

1712
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:16,210
off about something.
And that was what we would call going

1713
01:16:16,211 --> 01:16:18,600
full shimmy and like be,
you know,

1714
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:21,700
you're not going to do that if you're
worried about people not liking you.

1715
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:24,730
If you lose,
you've got to be free to go off.

1716
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:26,800
You know?
It's like we're a guy like joey,

1717
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,260
he's got,
you got to be free to be able to just

1718
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:33,160
cut loose and those bad managers are
fucking terrible for that because

1719
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:34,450
they've never done stand up.

1720
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,860
They don't know what it takes.
They don't,

1721
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:37,990
they don't,
they haven't grasped the concept that

1722
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,570
each individual has to find their own
path.

1723
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:45,070
All they're thinking about it as how to
mold someone into some bullshit persona

1724
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:47,740
from marketing for a marketing point of
view.

1725
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,350
Know for marketing purposes.
That's what they're thinking.

1726
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:52,380
How can I sell this guy?
I think the,

1727
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:54,320
the,
the pith thing is really,

1728
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,600
really well.
What I'd like to say,

1729
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,510
just take your own path.
Some people make it in two years.

1730
01:16:58,511 --> 01:17:00,140
SOme people making 10,
15 like look,

1731
01:17:00,150 --> 01:17:02,440
look like we're talking about joey.
D is like a.

1732
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:05,380
Once you rip a story to tell you about,
uh,

1733
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:10,220
your name and your manager on the to
mind,

1734
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:11,800
he probably,
I don't know if he wants that.

1735
01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:13,790
Okay.
So it was easy to find,

1736
01:17:13,791 --> 01:17:17,190
but it was him and he said he had.
We alwaYs have stories.

1737
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:18,800
So he says,
I tell trip.

1738
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,540
I said,
we're going to lake mead on saturday.

1739
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,800
You want to go?
And steve goes,

1740
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:22,930
no,
I can't put a.

1741
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:28,060
I can comp you a boat,
and he got your manager says to me,

1742
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:31,810
who the fuck else can copy a boat?
But europe,

1743
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:35,210
he was so connected to vegas.
Syrup is the best.

1744
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:40,890
Such a character as is my manager.
He just cut him character till he always

1745
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,840
really into now he goes striper fishing.
Really surf casting loves it.

1746
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,310
It's understanding the water.
Yeah.

1747
01:17:49,311 --> 01:17:51,410
He could stay on the water with waiters.
He could just stand on the.

1748
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:53,590
On the beach itself and cast into the
water.

1749
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:54,550
The ocean.
Yeah.

1750
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,170
We catches these giant ass fucking
striped bass.

1751
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:00,680
God,
there's A wild world just outside New

1752
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,300
York and a lot of people don't know
about it.

1753
01:18:02,350 --> 01:18:04,150
LikE you go to certain parts of long
island.

1754
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:06,350
He goes,
oh my god,

1755
01:18:06,351 --> 01:18:07,430
it's.
But it's incredible.

1756
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:09,890
He took me once.
We weren't successful,

1757
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:12,320
but I got it.
Just being there with them,

1758
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,230
I got what he likes about it.
Like there's a whole process to it.

1759
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:18,680
You take some air out of your tires and
there's places where you're allowed to

1760
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:22,220
drive onto the sand and you pull up on a
sand.

1761
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:25,360
These are like fairly remote areas in
long island and these guys cotu

1762
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,460
specifically just for surf casting,
striped bass.

1763
01:18:28,461 --> 01:18:32,090
That's what everybody wants to catch.
They want to catch stripers and casting

1764
01:18:32,091 --> 01:18:35,060
out these giant ass fucking polls
because you know you can get a 30 pound

1765
01:18:35,061 --> 01:18:37,100
fat.
She got big ass striped bass out there

1766
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:38,090
and they don't.

1767
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:40,430
You don't catch them that often,
but sometimes you run into a whole

1768
01:18:40,431 --> 01:18:43,490
school level them and everybody catches
him and those are like these magical

1769
01:18:43,491 --> 01:18:45,110
times.
It'S an interesting.

1770
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:47,750
It's a lot of ways.
FisHing is like an interesting

1771
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:52,010
discipline and jeff,
I don't have the patience for it now to

1772
01:18:52,011 --> 01:18:55,940
add.
Will you play pool though?

1773
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,720
I love pool.
But you have patients for that?

1774
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,180
Yeah.
Well I guess I have pages for the things

1775
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:05,600
I love fishing to me.
I can't imagine.

1776
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,700
Have you ever caught a fish and then
cooked it and ate it?

1777
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:09,230
No.
How dare you?

1778
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:11,870
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

1779
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,540
I'm a pescatarian.
It's one of these people that say

1780
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:20,900
they only meet,
but they fish like as if that's humane

1781
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,900
is a fish,
don't have feelings.

1782
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,350
Well,
they don't take care of the children.

1783
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,230
What fish?
You know this shit out.

1784
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,890
Some eggs and the mail comes over and
comes on him like a freak show.

1785
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:32,810
That's what happens.
That's very rude.

1786
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:35,810
That's how they do it.
Who we talk about this later.

1787
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:40,610
I saw a guy on instagram bragging about
how he's 90 percent vegetarian.

1788
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:47,150
He was talking shit about people who eat
meat and hunters in particular.

1789
01:19:47,151 --> 01:19:48,860
You're talking shit about hunting and
he's saying,

1790
01:19:48,861 --> 01:19:49,730
look,
I get it.

1791
01:19:49,731 --> 01:19:52,880
I'm 90 percent vegetarian,
but you know what you people are doing.

1792
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:56,720
It's awful like fuck bacon because it's
delicious.

1793
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,990
How funny is that?
We're someone who can attest that he

1794
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,900
fucking bacon ham sandwiches
cheeseburgers.

1795
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:05,990
Every now and then he goes off,
so he's tryIng to say that he's got some

1796
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:10,230
moral right to complain about someone
who hunts because he's 90 percent

1797
01:20:10,231 --> 01:20:13,320
vegetarian and vegan either by the way,
which means milk,

1798
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:14,700
animal products,
eggs.

1799
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:18,090
That's a tough particulate fuck.
Ridiculous dummy,

1800
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:23,070
but that that taking the moral high
ground from saying I killed less animals

1801
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:28,190
per year than most men most of the time,
not killing anything.

1802
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:32,370
People are so goofy.
Ninety percent vegetarian.

1803
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,690
The fact that you would write that down
and go,

1804
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:36,860
yes,
and that's it posted.

1805
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,790
I'm.
Will I let this motherfucker?

1806
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:42,060
No,
I've never heard that.

1807
01:20:42,061 --> 01:20:44,580
That'S the most ridiculous.
I've ever heard a lot of

1808
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:47,400
rationalizations,
but that's so many dummies out there,

1809
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:51,600
if you will.
I think that like if you did go catch a

1810
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,940
fish once and then cook it and eat it,
you would get it.

1811
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:56,910
You definitely get a little bit.
It's fun.

1812
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,420
It's fun to catch them and then they
taste so good.

1813
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:05,070
If you can catch a fish and then have it
cooked or you cook it within a few hours

1814
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:07,350
of pulling it out of the ocean.
Holy shit.

1815
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,920
It's like a different thing.
Something happens to fish when it sits

1816
01:21:10,921 --> 01:21:14,250
around for too long.
Even when it's frozen and thawed out,

1817
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,580
it just doesn't retain the same quality
that it has when you pull it right out

1818
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,331
of the water.
Yeah,

1819
01:21:18,331 --> 01:21:21,340
that's pretty cool.
I was at honolulu and they had a,

1820
01:21:21,530 --> 01:21:23,190
a place where you cook your own fish.

1821
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,080
I didn't want to cook.
We'll fish

1822
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,120
to wash my own dishes to what the book
had a restaurant.

1823
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:30,900
We don't like go to those,
uh,

1824
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,420
those grill places where you lay the
meat out.

1825
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,870
They have like a japanese place near me.
Then I was like these little grills in

1826
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:38,850
front of the bace yeah,
something like that.

1827
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:40,890
And you lay the meaning,
you cook it right in front of you.

1828
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,110
You seen that show?
Korean barbecue.

1829
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:46,030
Korean barbecue.
But I've also seen a japanese one,

1830
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:47,610
you know,
they probably ripped it off froM the

1831
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:48,990
kranz.
Let's be honest.

1832
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:54,300
It's still a controversy over the year.
Cook.

1833
01:21:54,330 --> 01:21:55,950
You cook it yourself.
It's kinD of weird.

1834
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:57,170
You're cooking,
you know,

1835
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,220
what do you,
do you provide Me a plate of meat?

1836
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:01,100
It was a couple of actual like grill.
I don't,

1837
01:22:01,220 --> 01:22:03,720
I don't know exactly where they are,
but I've seen them on tv probably

1838
01:22:03,721 --> 01:22:05,390
because there's only one or two.
But uh,

1839
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,210
You go pick up your meat like a butcher,
like the front of the store is at

1840
01:22:08,211 --> 01:22:11,010
butcher type place in the back is a
bunch of grills and you hang out with

1841
01:22:11,011 --> 01:22:13,320
your friends and grill your own steaks.
Wow.

1842
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,450
At the restaurant.
Then just sit down like a picnic table.

1843
01:22:15,451 --> 01:22:17,100
Do the.
I know if you know what you're doing

1844
01:22:17,101 --> 01:22:17,850
though,
it's fun.

1845
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,090
And then you don't have to do any of the
cleanup if they do it the right way.

1846
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,470
Like if they have really good grills
they use like mesquite lump charcoal and

1847
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:26,280
got,
you know,

1848
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,180
they set the calls up.

1849
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,590
Nice.
I have a pretty cool.

1850
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,520
I use white to cook and yummy.
Which why cook cook cook is like a thing

1851
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:39,780
a friend of mine owns it and it's like
high end restaurants that deliver.

1852
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,230
It's just called a friend of mine.
He uh,

1853
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,600
he's a triathlete.
Right.

1854
01:22:45,601 --> 01:22:47,280
And he's probably gonna make the
olympics.

1855
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:49,830
He was standing over my house and I
said,

1856
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:53,610
you want to go shopping or something?
I go and I hand them the Yummy thing.

1857
01:22:53,611 --> 01:22:54,840
What do you mean?
I said,

1858
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,300
we're not going anywhere.
He Just fucking call for the food.

1859
01:22:57,330 --> 01:22:58,600
You don't go to restaurants.
Oh,

1860
01:22:58,610 --> 01:22:59,580
I go to restaurants.
Yeah.

1861
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:01,630
But you'd rather just have it delivered?
No,

1862
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:03,870
just from watching a game or something.
Oh,

1863
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:05,380
okay.
So do you cook ever?

1864
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:10,040
Never reheat.
So you have like a whole great.

1865
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:14,140
Just sits there.
I this the only time that my stove is

1866
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:15,010
used as the heat.

1867
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:17,110
A border for t.
Hmm.

1868
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:21,340
That's interesting.
You've never like sat down and cooked a

1869
01:23:21,341 --> 01:23:25,120
steak and mashed potatoes or anything?
I used to cook what I call chicken.

1870
01:23:25,121 --> 01:23:28,030
I rarer,
which was a two lonG,

1871
01:23:28,180 --> 01:23:30,790
two lumps of margarine and black pepper
on chicken.

1872
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,690
A 325 for an hour.
Jesus,

1873
01:23:34,691 --> 01:23:36,280
the only thing I ever cooked.
How bad was it?

1874
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,350
I don't know.
I was starving.

1875
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:39,910
Started facebook.
Pretty good.

1876
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:45,360
This is when I was really broke through
on my little joey bag of donuts attacked

1877
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:48,970
you.
So you never got into like cooking

1878
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:50,430
yourself a meal.
That's interesting.

1879
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,360
I'm a big fan of cooking.
Yeah,

1880
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,960
I love it.
It's good.

1881
01:23:54,961 --> 01:23:58,160
I keep your head straight.
I'm walt's also bomb.

1882
01:23:58,690 --> 01:24:02,320
It's a satisfying.
We make a nIce meal and sit down and eat

1883
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:03,154
it.
I like it.

1884
01:24:03,190 --> 01:24:05,980
Plus I like controlling what goes in my
body.

1885
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:09,130
One hundred percent know,
like I'm on this wacky,

1886
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:12,460
very low carb,
low sugar intake diet,

1887
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:14,140
no process or no added sugar.

1888
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,990
I don't eat any candy or soda,
no ice cream,

1889
01:24:16,991 --> 01:24:20,440
no bullshit.
And on this diet I kind of have to make

1890
01:24:20,441 --> 01:24:23,410
sure that I control like even salad
dressings,

1891
01:24:23,411 --> 01:24:26,330
like you would think you'd go to a nice
restaurant and you order a salad and

1892
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,181
then you're eating it.
You go,

1893
01:24:27,181 --> 01:24:29,530
okay,
this is filled with sugar.

1894
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:30,860
I could taste this.
Dressings,

1895
01:24:30,861 --> 01:24:31,540
films,
sugar.

1896
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:34,130
Well tHey don't care.
They want it to be delicious and health.

1897
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:38,080
Well they also don't have to put like
the ingredients in the menu.

1898
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:42,550
Like when you see the menu and it says
like balsamic vinegarette doesn't say

1899
01:24:42,551 --> 01:24:46,230
what's in that balsamic vinograd.
It might be just chock full of fucking

1900
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:49,180
sugar.
Some of those stakes or ruth's chris or

1901
01:24:49,181 --> 01:24:51,030
one of those.
I don't want to nail any,

1902
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,790
any particular steakhouse,
but they,

1903
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:55,020
they broil them in butter.
Like,

1904
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:58,210
it ain't fucking fat enough to eat a
steak in butter.

1905
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,640
It's all good for you though.
Well,

1906
01:25:00,641 --> 01:25:01,600
it's delicious.
I don't know.

1907
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,740
Good for you.
Good for you though.

1908
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,790
For your fucking heart problems.
Hey,

1909
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:08,200
you got a problem already?
Set the stakes.

1910
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,050
Paul.
You've converted me.

1911
01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:16,110
It's not dietary cholesterol.
Barely moved the needle on blood lipids.

1912
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:19,840
There's all sorts of problems that lead
to people having high cholesterol,

1913
01:25:19,841 --> 01:25:21,590
sedentary lifestyle.
um,

1914
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:24,150
there's a lot of genetic problems,
but they're finding now that like

1915
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:28,330
saturated fats and all these things that
we're blaming and on issues with people.

1916
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:30,720
That's not necessarily what the problem.
What's the problem?

1917
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:33,400
There's a host of problems that exercise
is a big problem.

1918
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,380
It's a big problem.
Huge problem with people.

1919
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:37,630
The over consumption of certain types of
foods,

1920
01:25:37,631 --> 01:25:38,890
you know,
sedentary lifestyles.

1921
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,600
You Just even sitting in a chair all
day.

1922
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:44,860
It's fucking terrible.
I get inspired today because of the bed

1923
01:25:44,861 --> 01:25:47,560
I was playing pool and I'm going to get
back on the table.

1924
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:49,810
You're going to get back.
I just say a challenge.

1925
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:51,850
So we have a table in your apartment?
yeah.

1926
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:52,843
What the fuck?
Dumb.

1927
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:57,550
I mean how lazy you have to be not to
walk and I mean I got a treadmill.

1928
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:01,000
I got a bike,
I did tHe treadmill today for 20

1929
01:26:01,001 --> 01:26:02,170
minutes.
Like it's a big deal,

1930
01:26:02,171 --> 01:26:04,010
but it's better than nothing sitting
there like a big

1931
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,690
fucking blow.
Big tits.

1932
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,700
The treadmills.
Great for 20 minutes.

1933
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,740
That's good.
If you could do 20 minutes every day,

1934
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:12,080
just force yourself to do only 20
minutes every day.

1935
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,640
Put a television show on.
It's what I do.

1936
01:26:15,780 --> 01:26:18,230
That's great.
Watch cnn or espn,

1937
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:19,100
you know,
it's great.

1938
01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:21,650
Do you ever see steve?
Steve harvey does his morning show.

1939
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:25,880
Steve harvey does the fucking morning
shoW sometimes on an elliptical machine.

1940
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:28,950
Really?
It's taking phone calls on a goddamned

1941
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:30,860
elliptical machine.
This is a radio show,

1942
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:36,640
steve harvey in the morning.
So hilarious grind and hustle and grind

1943
01:26:37,371 --> 01:26:38,360
and hustle.
That's what he says.

1944
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:41,180
He works a lot with your head down.
Granted,

1945
01:26:41,181 --> 01:26:42,320
hustle.
Yeah,

1946
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:43,150
he works a lot,
man.

1947
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:44,820
It does pay.
It does pay.

1948
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:47,990
The guy works hard.
You can't say anything other than that.

1949
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:49,870
When you.
You're talking about the guy's worth

1950
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,410
work ethic.
Steven was constantly doing so.

1951
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,200
I don't know many people.
Your energy.

1952
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:57,710
I'm doing a bunch of fun and I'm
enjoying things.

1953
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:01,460
Enjoyable.
Things anoint that sounded like it was a

1954
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:03,170
14 slip,
but it's not.

1955
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,370
They're all enjoyable.
You know,

1956
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:07,370
podcasts are enjoyable.
Ufc is enjoyable.

1957
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:09,740
This is enjoyable.
It's fun to watch you to understand that

1958
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:12,040
now because a,
you're.

1959
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:15,710
You really have fun now.
You know that like the difference

1960
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:18,170
between you when I first met you with
all of us,

1961
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,390
hopefully evolve and hopefully for the
better,

1962
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,590
but I see you.
You have that smirk on your face.

1963
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,540
That is.
I know that you're enjoying it.

1964
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,960
It's fun.
You know?

1965
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,090
You know,
it's fun.

1966
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,850
I've been,
I've been enjoying being at the store.

1967
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:35,090
That's a big part of it.
I've been enjoying that and it's funny

1968
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:38,520
how your friends can inspire.
like jim carrey was in when I.

1969
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,010
I don't know if I told you this.

1970
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:43,580
ended up getting like a little part in
his pilot lands.

1971
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:45,070
comedian.
Yeah.

1972
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:47,710
On what is that thing going to show?
There was a lot of hype.

1973
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,160
I don't think it's going to show up for
a while.

1974
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:52,280
I think the cast,
and it's still a short starts shooting

1975
01:27:52,281 --> 01:27:53,240
till julY.
oh,

1976
01:27:53,241 --> 01:27:56,450
they haven't started shooting yet,
but in this one little kid,

1977
01:27:56,980 --> 01:28:00,200
the little kid that you always comes out
like when you.

1978
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:04,970
When I saw you in marin in the back,
I really wanted to have a good set for

1979
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:08,060
the fun of showing up front of my friend
jim was there.

1980
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:11,780
I hadn't seen him since actually since
rodney died and jim,

1981
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:13,910
I knew him from the comedy store and I
went.

1982
01:28:13,911 --> 01:28:15,850
I sHowed off for him like I wanted to
do,

1983
01:28:15,851 --> 01:28:18,350
you know what I mean?
I'm not above admitting that I was

1984
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:19,970
fucking showing what's inspiring.

1985
01:28:20,020 --> 01:28:21,290
I mean you can call it,
show it off,

1986
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:23,070
but you know,
you want to put on a show for him.

1987
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:24,340
Yeah.
Something wrong with that.

1988
01:28:24,650 --> 01:28:26,230
That's one of the cool things about that
place.

1989
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:27,910
This is a very high level.
You know,

1990
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:29,060
man,
go there any night.

1991

1998
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:43,380
We're watching her that.
No,

1999
01:28:43,390 --> 01:28:45,120
that's what I went on.
Went on right after.

2000
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:48,810
You're making fun of that pit.
How funny is she?

2001
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:52,000
She's a monster man.
She's fucking podcasts.

2002
01:28:52,030 --> 01:28:54,890
Hilarious to you heard their podcast.
It's called your mom's house.

2003
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,330
It's really funny,
man.

2004
01:28:56,570 --> 01:28:57,890
They're,
they're really silly.

2005
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:01,040
They're really fun together.
It's a great.

2006
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:01,980
And they do want a

2007
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,900
real smart too.
I was talking to them aBout it,

2008
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:05,490
you know,
we're talking about like how many they

2009
01:29:05,491 --> 01:29:08,670
do a week and he's like,
we'd like to do one a week because that

2010
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:11,520
way we do like a lot of living in
between shows,

2011
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,040
you know,
and it's paying off.

2012
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:17,250
They do live shows.
They do live podcasts on the road.

2013
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,200
That didn't even work with you
sometimes.

2014
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,460
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2015
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:25,910
I met tom when we were doing the maximum
real men of comedy tour.

2016
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:28,040
Me,
charlie murphy and john heffron.

2017
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,980
And what we did was we went across the
country and they would use a local act

2018
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:34,320
to warm the show up.
That would be like the first guy.

2019
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:36,240
So the first guy would do like,
I don't know,

2020
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:40,560
10 or 15 or something like that and that
would be the local guy and in some

2021
01:29:40,561 --> 01:29:42,330
places they didn't use local guys.

2022
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:45,900
They just used guys that somebody liked
or somebody thought was good.

2023
01:29:45,901 --> 01:29:47,280
they just cast somebody,
you know,

2024
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,490
I don't remember who the booking agent
was that put the tour together,

2025
01:29:50,491 --> 01:29:52,390
but they did this and they were,
you know,

2026
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,850
some good guys.
So funny guys.

2027
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,820
And tHen there was cigar and we were in
phoenix.

2028
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:02,370
We did that theater in the round of
hollywood theater and a cigar went out.

2029
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:07,410
It just killed and I was crying,
laughing and he's just ridiculous.

2030
01:30:07,411 --> 01:30:08,244
And,
and,

2031
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:11,790
and his jokes are absurd.
Just,

2032
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:15,090
he's so good.
He was so good at then.

2033
01:30:15,150 --> 01:30:15,841
And then,
you know,

2034
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:17,760
we became friends and I started taking
them the road.

2035
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,370
Is there anybody at anytime in your
career that you didn't want to follow?

2036
01:30:24,150 --> 01:30:25,320
Oh yeah,
yeah.

2037
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:28,250
When I was young for sure because I
didn't understand.

2038
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:32,070
I would think that them doing well meant
that I wouldn't do well.

2039
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,830
But all that means is that you need to
get better.

2040
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:36,780
You need to work on your act.
You know this,

2041
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,970
this.
Everyone's wants to protect the state

2042
01:30:38,971 --> 01:30:41,580
that they're in right now.
like anytime you're,

2043
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:45,180
if you're in a state that the audience
doesn't think is funny,

2044
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:48,870
you got to figure out a way out of that.
Either got to figure out a way out of

2045
01:30:48,871 --> 01:30:53,160
that with more material or you gotta
there's Gotta be a way and you might not

2046
01:30:53,161 --> 01:30:55,960
find that way tonight,
but that's a lesson and you've got to

2047
01:30:55,961 --> 01:30:57,870
take that lesson and you got to figure
out how,

2048
01:30:57,871 --> 01:30:59,190
what went wrong.
Well,

2049
01:30:59,191 --> 01:31:01,710
one of the things that goes wrong,
a lot of times you see someone kill anD

2050
01:31:01,711 --> 01:31:03,210
you get nervous and like,
shit,

2051
01:31:03,211 --> 01:31:06,630
I got to follow that.
You don't instead think this is awesome.

2052
01:31:06,631 --> 01:31:08,010
I'm laughing,
I'm having fun.

2053
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:09,360
THe audience is having fun too.

2054
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,240
Isn't comedy great?
You know,

2055
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:16,250
that's why I take joey in the road with
me like I'm doing like the arlington

2056
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:20,790
theater was tony hinchcliffe crushed for
like 25 minutes and then joey crushed

2057
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,190
for like 20 minutes,
25 minutes or whatever.

2058
01:31:23,191 --> 01:31:28,191
He did many minutes.
Still still going.

2059
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,150
Well you can't.
Do you know,

2060
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:32,540
you've always been great dom,
you know,

2061
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:37,550
when we first met and I was young and we
were in montreal together and then we

2062
01:31:37,561 --> 01:31:41,000
met at amsterdam and plates and pulled
down the you,

2063
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,690
you were always from the time I was like
basically just kind of starting out.

2064
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:51,140
You've always been like encouraging and
cool and fun to hang out with and you've

2065
01:31:51,901 --> 01:31:56,640
always been like a real comic's comic
and there's not a lot of guys

2066
01:31:57,030 --> 01:32:02,030
unfortunately that maintain that of um,
camaraderie and friendship with the

2067
01:32:02,801 --> 01:32:05,440
other people involved in their
profession,

2068
01:32:05,441 --> 01:32:06,274
you know?

2069
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:07,660
Well,
I appreciate you saying that.

2070
01:32:07,661 --> 01:32:09,010
I mean I get it back though,
you know,

2071
01:32:09,011 --> 01:32:12,040
it's like intelligent krista leo saiD
one night he goes,

2072
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:13,720
you know,
it's interesting about you.

2073
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:15,760
He goes,
I never think of you as older than us.

2074
01:32:15,761 --> 01:32:18,780
I think it was one of us.
That's all I want.

2075
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,920
I just want to be judged on my
performance.

2076
01:32:20,921 --> 01:32:22,330
Not that I'm older.

2077
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,380
Well,
You never stopped growing either.

2078
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:29,070
You never stop working and you never
stopped growing and you never stopped

2079
01:32:29,071 --> 01:32:33,840
constantly in evolving your act and you
Just have sharpie as you've always been.

2080
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:37,170
if not sharper and because of that,
like you're always going to be low.

2081
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,330
One of us for us,
all of us.

2082
01:32:39,331 --> 01:32:41,820
I think even for you and I in the early
days,

2083
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:47,150
there was those guys that came around
that the puzzle was too difficult for

2084
01:32:47,701 --> 01:32:50,790
them to solve for whatever reason,
and they never got there.

2085
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:54,330
They never got there and then they were
stuck and they would do these sets of

2086
01:32:54,331 --> 01:32:57,470
the store and they would do the same
material and you knew the jokes.

2087
01:32:57,471 --> 01:33:01,380
You knew the punchline because they had
been doing them for 15 years and we all

2088
01:33:01,381 --> 01:33:03,590
knew those guys.
Those guys.

2089
01:33:03,930 --> 01:33:05,010
Well,
it's unfortunate,

2090
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:06,900
but.
But those are the old guys.

2091
01:33:06,901 --> 01:33:09,690
It's not being old.
That chronological.

2092
01:33:09,691 --> 01:33:11,030
It's more of a state.
Yeah.

2093
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:13,580
Well it's just they're stagnant.
THey're stagnant.

2094
01:33:13,620 --> 01:33:18,120
Whereas a guy like carlin to the very
end was writing new material.

2095
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:20,550
This guy,
he died in a hotel.

2096
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:25,080
He was to the very end was writing and
creating and putting out a new hour

2097
01:33:25,081 --> 01:33:26,670
every year.
Just kept doing it.

2098
01:33:26,720 --> 01:33:30,150
Yeah,
I mean it doesn't happen and respected

2099
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:31,350
to the end.
Right.

2100
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:33,060
Absolutely.
Revered to the end.

2101
01:33:33,061 --> 01:33:34,830
People would go see him,
loving it to the end.

2102
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:35,390
Well,
you know,

2103
01:33:35,390 --> 01:33:39,890
who was amazing in that regard was
rodney dangerfield because he did joke

2104
01:33:39,891 --> 01:33:42,740
jokes that we would really consider
corny.

2105
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:46,520
His fucking character was so
overwhelmingly hilarious,

2106
01:33:46,521 --> 01:33:50,150
brilliant that we all loved him.
We all left and we respected him and he

2107
01:33:50,151 --> 01:33:51,080
never stopped writing.

2108
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,530
No,
no.

2109
01:33:52,531 --> 01:33:57,420
Rodney also was another supporter of
comedians like rodney dangerfield

2110
01:33:57,421 --> 01:33:59,790
specials.
The young comedian specials that you

2111
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:03,470
were on a dice was on.
Hicks was on that.

2112
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:05,560
Kinison was on shema.
Shema.

2113
01:34:05,610 --> 01:34:07,330
Lenny clarke let it.
Clark.

2114
01:34:07,620 --> 01:34:09,210
Carol liefer.
Barry sobel.

2115
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,990
Yup.
The.

2116
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:14,370
He.
He let the world know about some of the

2117
01:34:14,371 --> 01:34:16,170
best talent of your era.

2118
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:21,380
Did I ever tell you about when the
audition for him now was at the comedy

2119
01:34:21,381 --> 01:34:23,210
store was supposed to 10 minutes each.
Right.

2120
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:26,660
So barry sobel goes on to this 25
minutes.

2121
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,650
Then damon goes on this 25 minutes and
I'm fucking furious.

2122
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:33,820
Right?
So I go up and all I do is I said what

2123
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:36,170
the daemon expect and I love damon,
but this is not.

2124
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:37,280
Again,
this is a long time ago.

2125
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:41,600
I go with daymond expected,
like get funny at the 23rd minute,

2126
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,380
you know,
like it was like all of a sudden these

2127
01:34:43,381 --> 01:34:45,410
bomb and I said,
it wasn't happening for you tonight.

2128
01:34:45,411 --> 01:34:48,300
Daymond let it go.
And I Just felt so rodney comes up to

2129
01:34:48,301 --> 01:34:48,591
me,
he goes,

2130
01:34:48,591 --> 01:34:50,780
you don't kill your funny,
but what you do is lay into people.

2131
01:34:50,781 --> 01:34:52,720
WHat the fuck you got an act of war,
you know?

2132
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:55,460
And so then he saw me at the improv and
then I got it,

2133
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,190
but it was,
that was my introduction

2134
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,620
to rodney dangerfield.
What was like.

2135
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,720
Did you get upset at damon and not upset
at barry's?

2136
01:35:03,721 --> 01:35:05,400
So no,
I was upset about both of them.

2137
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:09,210
Just a daymond happened to be the one
right on before me was well farm or

2138
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:13,100
something.
He was now they were really tanking and

2139
01:35:13,101 --> 01:35:16,670
both of them are very effective
comedians and I was just pissed up

2140
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,890
because my thing is,
you know,

2141
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,550
it's 10 minute addition,
just do it,

2142
01:35:19,551 --> 01:35:22,880
do the best you can and get off,
but don't keep going because you're not

2143
01:35:22,881 --> 01:35:25,010
doing well or don't keep going because
you're doing well.

2144
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:28,430
Yeah.
There's some people that like if you are

2145
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:31,580
the audition for the comedy store and
they give you one of those five minutes

2146
01:35:31,581 --> 01:35:33,470
bots or three minutes or whatever the
hell it is.

2147
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:36,950
How many minutes is it?
I think it's three and when they come

2148
01:35:36,951 --> 01:35:40,070
see you though,
bring somebody in special showcase.

2149
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,700
This seems like 10 minutes each,
but I think if you bring somebody in,

2150
01:35:43,701 --> 01:35:47,270
if someone auditions for the talent
coordinator was how many minutes do they

2151
01:35:47,271 --> 01:35:49,460
do?
I don't like a pro comes in and they do

2152
01:35:49,461 --> 01:35:51,140
a set.
They do 10 minutes.

2153
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:52,880
I'm not sure,
but whatever it is,

2154
01:35:52,881 --> 01:35:54,950
if you go over that,
they just want to ask you.

2155
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:56,240
Oh,
I know this won't.

2156
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,300
I mean we don't need this.
Yeah.

2157
01:35:58,650 --> 01:36:02,110
We don't need some person who can't find
a friend that.

2158
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:05,750
Yeah,
unfortunately.

2159
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:08,150
Yeah.
I just respect other people's time and

2160
01:36:08,151 --> 01:36:10,580
let you know.
Like I told fucking thing about going on

2161
01:36:10,830 --> 01:36:14,150
when eddie griffin and those guys and
never had a problem with eddie,

2162
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:16,700
but that's,
you know that he will go on for hours.

2163
01:36:16,970 --> 01:36:20,630
It would close the place.
We'd go on at nine and stay on 1:00 in

2164
01:36:20,631 --> 01:36:24,470
the morning
and he wasn't even supposed to be like

2165
01:36:24,471 --> 01:36:25,070
on the lineup.

2166
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:28,340
He would just show up,
but that was when he was a huge star.

2167
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,560
You know,
that place has always been weird with

2168
01:36:30,590 --> 01:36:33,200
when people are huge stars.
They could just come in like damon needs

2169
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:36,650
to be able to come in anytime he wanted
and he would go on stage and do 45

2170
01:36:36,651 --> 01:36:38,420
minutes or whatever he wanted.
You know,

2171
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:40,820
it's like you,
you allowed tHem,

2172
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:43,580
you know,
you're allowed them that moment with

2173
01:36:43,581 --> 01:36:44,600
some people.
I mean,

2174
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:49,040
my thing is like one of the things that
I had anything to anybody younger than

2175
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:53,930
me that was my friend was to,
and it was not to abuse your power or be

2176
01:36:53,931 --> 01:36:55,820
a jerk off about it.
If somebody,

2177
01:36:55,821 --> 01:36:57,980
if you're going to bump somebody,
go up to them and say,

2178
01:36:57,981 --> 01:37:00,080
hi,
I'm going to do 10 minutes.

2179
01:37:00,081 --> 01:37:01,490
Are you cool with that?
If they say,

2180
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:03,250
I can't,
please don't wait.

2181
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,150
You know,
a lot of us have a real problem with it.

2182
01:37:05,151 --> 01:37:07,880
We don't like it and we don't do it and
we haven't done it,

2183
01:37:08,150 --> 01:37:10,460
you know,
I'm not a big believer in it.

2184
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:13,160
I think it's not that hard to call.
You never bumped people.

2185
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:14,870
No,
I don't think it's hard to call.

2186
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:18,620
It's not hard to call in and get on a
schedule and just,

2187
01:37:18,621 --> 01:37:19,550
you know,
try to figure it out.

2188
01:37:19,551 --> 01:37:22,520
And if you do show up and they asked to
put you on,

2189
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:25,250
I don't think that's bumping.
Like if you show up in the club,

2190
01:37:25,251 --> 01:37:28,670
asks you to go on and do a study.
Eddie shore's okay.

2191
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:31,190
You know,
you don't say hey I want to go on after

2192
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:34,070
I rare I'll put me up.
Because that's the thing that like,

2193
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:35,540
you know,
who used to like to do,

2194
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,020
you know,
like I don't want to,

2195
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:39,200
not really mexican.

2196
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,980
He used to like to show up.
Have you heard of it?

2197
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,240
Don't say his name is like candy man.
But people like to do it as like a power

2198
01:37:48,241 --> 01:37:49,100
trip.
Exactly.

2199
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:51,530
And they like to do it in front of you.
Let's say if they didn't like you,

2200
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:53,780
they will go up in front of you.
I'm going to go on after.

2201
01:37:53,781 --> 01:37:56,070
I really like say if someone was going
after you and he didn't like them,

2202
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,540
he'd go on right after you say I'm going
on next and then just go in there and

2203
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,660
just crush for 40 minutes and do half
your shit.

2204
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,460
But that was a different scenario,
you know,

2205
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:09,570
it was like a vampire and an artist's
colony.

2206
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,820
Red band said that he saw somebody do
one of my jokes.

2207
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:16,100
Who,
I dunno,

2208
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:19,800
I think he said then the guy they were.
It was like on a tv thing and the guy

2209
01:38:19,801 --> 01:38:22,890
hollered out that maria is joke,
joke.

2210
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,080
I don't know.
He because he told me he was going to

2211
01:38:25,081 --> 01:38:26,580
text you with that.
I guess he forgot.

2212
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:29,350
That's unlikely,
but I saw a thing.

2213
01:38:30,130 --> 01:38:32,260
Killing prime forgets everything.
Oh,

2214
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,270
does he?
It's partying.

2215
01:38:33,370 --> 01:38:35,910
Seventh grade time.
Kids squeezing an Orange.

2216
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:39,310
he's getting the juices out.
yeah.

2217
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:40,830
He smoked A little weed.
Dom.

2218
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:43,570
He does.
Does he does anything?

2219
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:45,300
All things in moderation.
Joseph.

2220
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,700
So your xanax thing,
it puts you.

2221
01:38:47,701 --> 01:38:50,700
You were saying at the beginning of the
podcast puts you like in a like a level

2222
01:38:50,701 --> 01:38:52,860
state.
Is there any downside to it?

2223
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,240
Yeah.
Drowsiness,

2224
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,760
drowsiness,
but the drowsiness probably calms you

2225
01:38:56,761 --> 01:38:58,250
down.
It makes you like maybe a little bit

2226
01:38:58,251 --> 01:38:59,850
more hilarious.
Yeah.

2227
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,770
I don't mean I don't get nervous for the
stage.

2228
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:05,940
I don't get nervous.
I get nervous for just being the ent

2229
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:10,650
existential angst of being or like were
you worried about mortality?

2230
01:39:10,651 --> 01:39:14,070
Worry about death or just on the hip on
it?

2231
01:39:14,071 --> 01:39:15,800
You know,
I mean I was,

2232
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:21,310
I was a stupid joke about we have to
have a finite number of loads left

2233
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:26,550
that we have enough just to shoot a
little.

2234
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,860
And I was thinking it's kind of sad but
interesting.

2235
01:39:29,861 --> 01:39:32,580
I wonder how many loads I have left.
Well,

2236
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:34,950
it's a matter of how much your body
needs.

2237
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:40,010
I would imagine if you spit in a bucket,
your body would be forced to produce

2238
01:39:40,231 --> 01:39:42,060
more spit because you're constantly
spitting.

2239
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:43,250
Yeah.
You know,

2240
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:44,790
like if you decided,
okay,

2241
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,630
today is april,
whatever the fuck it is,

2242
01:39:47,631 --> 01:39:50,880
team 2016,
the next 30 years.

2243
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,880
I'm trying to see how much spit I can do
in my spare time so I'm to get a vat,

2244
01:39:56,370 --> 01:40:01,370
I'm going to dig a hole in my backyard
and have some glass makers make this

2245
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:06,000
gigantic vat on my lift up the lid and
I'm going to spit in it every day and

2246
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:09,000
I'm going to try to fill that glass up
before I die here.

2247
01:40:09,050 --> 01:40:13,290
Imagine
you get a good answer out of you.

2248
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:15,510
If you did that,
if you had to Like the thing like you

2249
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:19,050
know like the lid of a fucking hot tub
and you lift it up and there's only got

2250
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:23,700
seven foot deep that it's made out of
glass and you're Just chucking louise in

2251
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:27,210
there and closing it up every day.
How much spit would you actually be able

2252
01:40:27,211 --> 01:40:29,640
to create?
Prevent evaporation,

2253
01:40:29,641 --> 01:40:33,150
so you would probably create life.
You can probably some new fucking

2254
01:40:33,151 --> 01:40:35,820
organism that grow out a thing and kill
your fucking neighbors.

2255
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,930
Joe,
who cleans up a bit with spit that,

2256
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:41,760
so I appreciate that.
A little classier level spit.

2257
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:42,690
Well,
I would sAy calm.

2258
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:46,110
You could do it with two,
but you wouldn't be able to measure it

2259
01:40:46,111 --> 01:40:47,880
because hopefully you're coming into
somebody

2260
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:53,980
or in the back of her head
that's hard to scrape

2261
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,150
it off and wait.
Exactly.

2262
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:58,450
But if you spit into a vat,
you'd have like a control.

2263
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:03,250
Have the that you have a nice seal air
tight seal so it's not going to

2264
01:41:03,251 --> 01:41:05,290
evaporate.
You know what I'm saying?

2265
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:06,790
Lift it up.
Close it down.

2266
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,140
I'm getting hungry.
Yeah.

2267
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:11,050
Yeah.
I mean hoW much come would be lost in

2268
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:13,600
their hair alone?
You would never get an accurate

2269
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:15,850
measurement.
You would have to like adjust for hair

2270
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:16,721
like.
Okay.

2271
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:20,320
How much did you end up scraping off?
My got about a half an ounce,

2272
01:41:20,321 --> 01:41:22,300
but I think there's another quarter in
that hair.

2273
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:27,400
Okay.
You'd have to like put an asterisk next

2274
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:31,330
to how much come did he come today.
So I definitely have the thing of how

2275
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:34,090
many times left in life.
Even when I was a kid,

2276
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:37,960
I rememBer being four years old and look
in the mirror and going,

2277
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:41,050
I can't believe I'm going to die some
day and I'm so fucking cute.

2278
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:49,580
I remember a conversation to have with
my stepdad when I was seven and it was

2279
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:52,520
right when I had lost my religion.
I lost my religion one.

2280
01:41:52,521 --> 01:41:52,780
Oh,
seven,

2281
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:53,870
seven.
Wow.

2282
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:56,980
I went to see age of reason.
Catholic school,

2283
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:00,220
catholic school did me in.
I just realized it was bullshit and my

2284
01:42:00,221 --> 01:42:02,800
parents were kinda.
My stepdad was a hippie and my,

2285
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:07,000
my parents were kind of becoming hippies
and my mom was becoming a hippie,

2286
01:42:07,001 --> 01:42:08,380
you know,
hanging out my step dad.

2287
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:11,020
But when I asked him,
I said,

2288
01:42:11,021 --> 01:42:12,970
well,
if you know,

2289
01:42:12,971 --> 01:42:14,590
if there's no heaven,
there's no god,

2290
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:17,650
what happens to you when you die?
And He's like,

2291
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:20,380
probably nothing.
Probably just use aren't here anymore.

2292
01:42:20,450 --> 01:42:23,980
I started crying.
I started crying.

2293
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:25,840
Sure.
I remember I was just so scared.

2294
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:28,930
I was just a natural instinct.
You don't want to end.

2295
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:33,180
Yeah.
We all have it and it's part of the,

2296
01:42:33,550 --> 01:42:38,550
the management of life is trying to
decide which way you allow your brain to

2297
01:42:42,191 --> 01:42:42,490
go.

2298
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:45,310
Not just today,
but forever.

2299
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:48,880
For as long as you're conscious.
There's got to be certain roads.

2300
01:42:48,881 --> 01:42:52,660
You don't go down and if you,
if you do,

2301
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:56,800
you have to be able to look at those
subjects or whatever those roads are

2302
01:42:56,830 --> 01:43:01,000
rationally because if you just want to
freak out and sit here and freak out

2303
01:43:01,001 --> 01:43:04,120
about death,
you're not going to enjoy this moment

2304
01:43:04,121 --> 01:43:05,920
which you have.
You are alive.

2305
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:09,250
You mean you right now.
We are all everyone listening to this is

2306
01:43:09,251 --> 01:43:13,630
alive and that this is all you've got.
This is what you've got.

2307
01:43:13,631 --> 01:43:14,940
You've got right now,
so what do you mean?

2308
01:43:14,941 --> 01:43:16,870
When is it going to be over?
It does.

2309
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:19,540
It literally does not matter for this
moment right now,

2310
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:23,800
for this moment right now,
it's hard to do because got enjoy this

2311
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:28,540
and it's going to go away one day,
but you don't have to dwell on that.

2312
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:31,450
Just leave that knowledge in your head
and enjoy this [inaudible].

2313
01:43:31,451 --> 01:43:36,451
What a shame it would be if this whole
thing was temporary and the whole time

2314
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:38,980
you could enjoy it because you were
worried.

2315
01:43:38,981 --> 01:43:42,580
When was it going to end and there were
so many cool aspects of it and so many

2316
01:43:42,581 --> 01:43:45,340
fun things to do.
Weird things to see and cool people to

2317
01:43:45,341 --> 01:43:50,341
meet and fun food to try and books to
read and movies to watch and places to

2318
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,010
visit and he just

2319
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,870
didn't do it.
He didn't do it because you are

2320
01:43:53,871 --> 01:43:57,800
paralyzed by the fear of this thing that
you're not even experiencing to the

2321
01:43:57,801 --> 01:44:01,970
fullest ending and also by the seeking
and the reward at the end.

2322
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:04,640
Like as if this time isn't a reward in
itself,

2323
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:05,491
you know,
this time,

2324
01:44:05,491 --> 01:44:05,901
minutes.
Yeah.

2325
01:44:05,901 --> 01:44:09,950
I mean that's what it takes a long
fucking time to cement that into my

2326
01:44:09,951 --> 01:44:12,220
stupid ed and that's why,
you know,

2327
01:44:12,221 --> 01:44:15,530
when you say like you see me having fun,
I am having fun.

2328
01:44:15,531 --> 01:44:19,880
I'm having more fun now doing standup
than I ever have in my life and I

2329
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:21,140
haven't seen it.
It was fun,

2330
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:22,640
man.
It's a fun thing,

2331
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:24,223
you know,
it's.

2332
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:28,370
When I approach it like that,
it'S been more rewarding.

2333
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,920
I think it might act is better.
I think that's all.

2334
01:44:30,921 --> 01:44:33,980
It's just.
And there's so many of us now.

2335
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,870
there's so many of us.

2336
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:39,690
When you do that one bit,
you're the closer.

2337
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:45,560
You were so into it.
It's so fucking funny but spooky,

2338
01:44:45,561 --> 01:44:49,450
but on so many levels it gets me.
That's why I asked you last night if you

2339
01:44:49,451 --> 01:44:52,730
had done it for a special yet.
That's going to be the next one.

2340
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:54,410
That'll be on the national.
You're closer to.

2341
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:56,240
I can't,
I can't follow it right now.

2342
01:44:56,830 --> 01:45:00,410
Um,
but I might be doing it in june.

2343
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:02,090
Trying to figure out what I'm going to
do.

2344
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:04,940
My special.
I'm working it all out right now.

2345
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:10,270
Dom herrera herrera from now on.
Netflix one within an x ray.

2346
01:45:13,410 --> 01:45:18,410
I should do one over and done with
funny on the side lines.

2347
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:28,170
Now you should do one man.
When was the last time you had someone

2348
01:45:28,401 --> 01:45:31,490
come out to see like that?
I don't remember.

2349
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:33,500
When.
are you doing a headliner setting down

2350
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:35,390
in town?
Yeah.

2351
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:39,020
Or anywhere near where?
The comedy magic club in june.

2352
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:41,060
Yeah.
I'll have the netflix people come out to

2353
01:45:41,061 --> 01:45:41,840
see you.
Oh yeah.

2354
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,240
Fuck.
Cool.

2355
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,720
Fuck it.
Do you know when in june?

2356
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,270
I'm not positive.
I should know the date.

2357
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:49,520
You should know your fucking dates.
Dumb either.

2358
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:53,830
Luckily yet on the internet.
The first week I'm at a kilkenny.

2359
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,670
The second week I'm at,

2360
01:45:57,190 --> 01:46:00,200

So you'll be in vegas.

2362
01:46:02,121 --> 01:46:06,170
That was in vegas and then then the next
week is a pretty sure that's it.

2363
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,510
Okay.
Yeah,

2364
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:10,070
it's either that or the weekend before
the July 4th.

2365
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:13,220
Um,
I think I might be home or that might be

2366
01:46:13,221 --> 01:46:14,120
a ufc.

2367
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:16,670
Why don't I feel like that's a ufc.
Okay.

2368
01:46:16,671 --> 01:46:18,690
There's your schedule a.
He had a,

2369
01:46:18,691 --> 01:46:20,450
a nod.
Yeah.

2370
01:46:20,570 --> 01:46:23,090
The July 6th through twelfth.

2371
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:24,440

And then right after that,

2373
01:46:27,121 --> 01:46:29,300
it must be comedy magic club sexual
comedy festival.

2374
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:32,650
Yeah.
I don't know why that's the magic clubs

2375
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:34,610
not in there.
And the funniness see perth,

2376
01:46:34,611 --> 01:46:36,530
Australia and then delray beach,
Florida.

2377
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:39,170
It's a big chunk of the earth.
Yeah.

2378
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:42,440
That's a big swath.
You're cutting a path through this great

2379
01:46:42,441 --> 01:46:43,520
land of ours.
Yes.

2380
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,080
You are with your jokes.
Humor giving.

2381
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:55,000
So what's that?
We're going to wrap this up.

2382
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:57,630
Okay.
I just got to say I had so much fun last

2383
01:46:57,630 --> 01:46:59,370
night with the girls to store.
Oh yeah,

2384
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:00,720
david,
the greatest staff,

2385
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,900
the girls and the boys too.
It's not be gender specific.

2386
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:07,770
Tinkering around with the girls and
jessie wonder.

2387
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:11,610
Yeah,
she's great in the wait staff is great.

2388
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:14,760
Everybody's great management staffs
crate emily's great.

2389
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:16,200
The people that work there are just
great.

2390
01:47:16,410 --> 01:47:17,430
It's a great place,
man.

2391
01:47:17,460 --> 01:47:20,220
It's got a great vibe now.
It's almost a completely different

2392
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:21,990
universe.
It is completely different.

2393
01:47:21,991 --> 01:47:24,900
It's like it was sad.
There's happiness there now.

2394
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:28,440
It was like he was sick and someone came
along and gave it medicine and now it's

2395
01:47:28,441 --> 01:47:30,030
not sick anymore.
Now it's a flourishing.

2396
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:31,140
Exactly.
Totally different.

2397
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:34,560
It was on the ropes for three years
while I think it was going to stay open.

2398
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:35,730
Well,
when I came back with,

2399
01:47:35,731 --> 01:47:37,920
I watched already do a special,
which I,

2400
01:47:37,921 --> 01:47:40,650
uh,
if you watch the podcast with ari and

2401
01:47:40,651 --> 01:47:42,540
you notice that I almost cried like a
bitch.

2402
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:46,360
You'd be correct when,
when I left it or no,

2403
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:50,670
I almost cried because we were talking
about me coming back to the store and

2404
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:53,550
you know,
here it goes again.

2405
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,830
Are,
he's been my friend since he was a

2406
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:57,150
doorman.
Yeah.

2407
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:59,580
You know,
we were buddies when he was an amateur,

2408
01:47:59,610 --> 01:48:04,610
I mean it was just starting out and so
for me to be on a hiatus from the store,

2409
01:48:05,470 --> 01:48:06,031
I was,
I wouldn't,

2410
01:48:06,031 --> 01:48:08,940
didn't perform there for seven years.
The one of the main,

2411
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:11,310
the main motivating factor was two
things.

2412
01:48:11,311 --> 01:48:14,010
One that I'm adam egot.
It came,

2413
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:19,040
came to see me at the improv and then
talk to me and told me he's running it

2414
01:48:19,261 --> 01:48:22,260
now and I knew adam from phoenix.
Phoenix,

2415
01:48:22,261 --> 01:48:23,100
right.
That was big.

2416
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:24,840
That was big.
But the biggest one was

2417
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:27,930
that a.
Or he was doing his special.

2418
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:31,370
They're just no way,
you know,

2419
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:32,570
there's no way I was going to miss that.

2420
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:33,211
Right.
Well,

2421
01:48:33,211 --> 01:48:34,560
do you remember me telling you to come
back?

2422
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:36,570
Yeah,
because I said to you,

2423
01:48:36,571 --> 01:48:38,490
I remember exactly the conversation.
I said,

2424
01:48:38,491 --> 01:48:40,590
joe,
that past is over.

2425
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:43,560
We're,
we've got a bunch of your friends are

2426
01:48:43,561 --> 01:48:46,650
over there and we would love you to come
back.

2427
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:50,100
It was like going to because they bet on
the wrong horse.

2428
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,290
Right.
And that whole thing went down.

2429
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:57,480
It was just so many crazy things going
on at that place was running it before

2430
01:48:57,481 --> 01:49:00,360
it was out of his mind.
This has nothing to do with the past.

2431
01:49:00,361 --> 01:49:02,430
That's why it was so great that you came
back.

2432
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:04,580
You know,
everybody loves you there.

2433
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:05,820
Everybody we have.
So you know,

2434
01:49:05,821 --> 01:49:07,090
it's,
it's fun because you,

2435
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:09,860
you don't separate yourself from them,
you know,

2436
01:49:09,861 --> 01:49:11,730
like,
like we were talking about people's

2437
01:49:11,731 --> 01:49:16,150
attitudes and it's just such a,
it's so fun to have you back there and

2438
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,820
like,
I know that I'm going to see you once or

2439
01:49:17,821 --> 01:49:18,750
twice a week there.

2440
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:20,910
You know,
before you were to places that I didn't

2441
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:24,320
feel like driving to the ice house.
Yeah.

2442
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:26,640
Yeah,
I hear you brother.

2443
01:49:26,641 --> 01:49:27,600
I feel the same way,
man.

2444
01:49:27,630 --> 01:49:28,860
I'm happy.
I'm happy.

2445
01:49:28,861 --> 01:49:30,540
But I still like doing the ice house to
man.

2446
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:32,820
Oh no,
I'm not trying weekend there soon.

2447
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,920
I like iT too.
I fucking place is awesome.

2448
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,990
This is the greatest time ever for
comedy.

2449
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:40,050
This is the greatest spot to la.
If I didn't live in la,

2450
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:42,240
I'd want to be here.
I really would like.

2451
01:49:42,241 --> 01:49:45,120
There's so much good comedy on.
Here's a lot of good writing going on.

2452
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:46,320
It's competitive,
you know,

2453
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:47,970
it's competitive and it's also

2454
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:52,810
healthy supportive way more than it was
like 20 years ago.

2455
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,840
Like when we first came here,
you were here before me,

2456
01:49:55,841 --> 01:49:57,490
but when I first came here in
[inaudible] 94,

2457
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:01,660
it just was fucking real shitty.
Wasn't supportive.

2458
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:03,700
No.
Everybody was out for themselves.

2459
01:50:03,790 --> 01:50:07,080
it was tainted also by,
this is what this is.

2460
01:50:07,081 --> 01:50:11,260
I have this theory and I'm pretty pretty
sure there's some validity to it.

2461
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:16,150
I think that the standup comedy of the
eighties and the nineties that we knew

2462
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:21,151
of this was also tainted by the
television business because everybody

2463
01:50:21,911 --> 01:50:23,710
was trying to get a tv deal.
Yeah,

2464
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:28,030
so the guys who came out here,
everybody was trying to do showcase sets

2465
01:50:28,031 --> 01:50:33,031
for executives and for writers and they
were trying to get a set together so

2466
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:38,320
they could cash in like roseanne and get
their cells that fat seinfeld money or

2467
01:50:38,321 --> 01:50:42,550
then rhett butler money get the long
cash that will come with being the star

2468
01:50:42,551 --> 01:50:43,300
of a sitcom.

2469
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:45,390
That was the goal of course,
and so we.

2470
01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:50,490
We had this sort of actory thing going
on in comedy and it was weird,

2471
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:54,280
it was weird for a long time,
but when the sitcoms started drying up

2472
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:58,480
because of the reality shows,
a lot of comics got resentful because

2473
01:50:58,481 --> 01:51:03,481
like even marin got resentful with me
because my show in his mind was taking

2474
01:51:03,491 --> 01:51:08,491
up a slot that could have been filled by
comics that were working as writers,

2475
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:10,360
but my point was like,
but yeah,

2476
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:13,510
but the comments work and his writers
know this fear factor.

2477
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:14,170
Oh,
fear effect,

2478
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:18,280
but my point was at is writers are still
not even doing standup.

2479
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,650
I guess not taking anything away from
the art of standup.

2480
01:51:20,970 --> 01:51:23,080
It's just a slot on television.
Ultimately,

2481
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:27,820
those shows all the brutal and weird and
the way that they just sort of decimated

2482
01:51:27,821 --> 01:51:29,080
the sitcom landscape.

2483
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:32,290
A lot of them that there's not even
nearly as many sitcoms as there used to

2484
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:34,170
be.
Remember how many goddamn sitcoms there

2485
01:51:34,171 --> 01:51:35,810
were at one time I met with.
Yeah,

2486
01:51:36,180 --> 01:51:39,840
there's a lot of fucking reality shows.
A lot of weirdness in these,

2487
01:51:40,030 --> 01:51:45,030
but what that forced everyone to do was
to go online and then stand up right now

2488
01:51:46,061 --> 01:51:47,750
is just about standup again.
Yeah,

2489
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:51,280
so like the goal is now not to get a
sitcom,

2490
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:53,410
which is still awesome if you're like
someone like dalea,

2491
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:57,570
but the goal is instead to get netflix
specials like so gura,

2492
01:51:58,150 --> 01:52:02,900
so garage has no tv to speak of and he's
selling out big ass theaters.

2493
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,950
He's killing it and it's just from
netflix specials.

2494
01:52:06,190 --> 01:52:08,980
So the whole thing changed from his
podcast,

2495
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:12,220
from other people's podcasts where you
got to know him and then from netflix

2496
01:52:12,221 --> 01:52:15,220
specials the whole thing changed.
So that's the goal now.

2497
01:52:15,310 --> 01:52:19,630
So I think like the level of comedy is
really high now because everybody's like

2498
01:52:19,631 --> 01:52:22,210
in the comedy again,
like there's a lot of guys that are into

2499
01:52:22,211 --> 01:52:26,500
doing it for the sake of doing it.
JuSt the fun of going out there and

2500
01:52:26,501 --> 01:52:27,760
putting on a live show.

2501
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:30,230
yeah.
Somebody asked me to go,

2502
01:52:30,231 --> 01:52:33,850
what do you still do it so much?
I go because I love it and I'm trying to

2503
01:52:33,851 --> 01:52:36,790
improve.
It will improve how you're going to

2504
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:39,520
improve and like basically your agent,
I don't know,

2505
01:52:39,521 --> 01:52:42,400
but I'm going to try to fucking give up
and go,

2506
01:52:42,401 --> 01:52:43,240
well,
you know,

2507
01:52:43,980 --> 01:52:46,010
I know I'll do this bit that I did 20
years

2508
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,360
ago.
There'll be new to them.

2509
01:52:48,130 --> 01:52:49,270
Yeah,
yeah.

2510
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:50,450
Well that's why,
you know,

2511
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:52,430
I,
talia said you're not an older guy like

2512
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:55,460
you're a comic.
And I think that,

2513
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,620
I think that applies to everything in
life.

2514
01:52:58,010 --> 01:52:59,900
You know,
if you got a guy who's a,

2515
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:04,280
an old car designer is resting on his
laurels or a guy who was an old author

2516
01:53:04,281 --> 01:53:08,630
was writing shitty books and resting on
the books that he wrote 20,

2517
01:53:08,631 --> 01:53:10,490
30 years ago,
he's not going to be as interesting,

2518
01:53:10,970 --> 01:53:14,810
you know,
there's no reason to not produce and be

2519
01:53:14,811 --> 01:53:16,280
creative.
There's no reason to.

2520
01:53:16,550 --> 01:53:18,560
He could still do it and you'll feel
better if you do.

2521
01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:19,780
There was a guy,
uh,

2522
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:20,380
you know,
um,

2523
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:23,510
I don't feel like putting them down
really well.

2524
01:53:23,890 --> 01:53:24,723
No,
I'm just kidding.

2525
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:27,770
And is on stage and,
and chris,

2526
01:53:27,771 --> 01:53:32,360
that guy at fucking mother fucker.
so the guy.

2527
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:37,770
Do you ever hear shame attached?
Doing a jewish joe pesci getting blown

2528
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:40,210
by Joan Rivers.
That's fucking funny.

2529
01:53:41,990 --> 01:53:45,890
she's hilarious.
She's worked with me in reno in may.

2530
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:48,080
she lives up there.
That should be up there.

2531
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:49,820
Was that.
She lives in vegas.

2532
01:53:49,821 --> 01:53:50,654
Yeah.
Yeah.

2533
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:52,810
How come that's on your.
Who does your calendar there?

2534
01:53:53,010 --> 01:53:55,340
The guy in montreal.
Kill him to get his fucking shit

2535
01:53:55,341 --> 01:53:56,810
together.
What else is there?

2536
01:53:56,811 --> 01:53:59,990
The vegas thing.
Then governors and that's all down the

2537
01:53:59,991 --> 01:54:00,800
road.
brokerage.

2538
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:03,110
They should let people know what's the
guy's name?

2539
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:05,190
Call them out.
Uh,

2540
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:07,850
you shit.
Fuck.

2541
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:10,750
It's me too.
And that you're not getting into him for

2542
01:54:10,751 --> 01:54:11,660
things.
Oh yeah.

2543
01:54:11,710 --> 01:54:12,543
Yeah.
You got an email.

2544
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:13,130
Got,
you know,

2545
01:54:13,130 --> 01:54:15,980
the twitter thing helps a lot more.
Oh yeah.

2546
01:54:16,490 --> 01:54:17,181
No,
it's amazing.

2547
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:18,830
Facebook's great.
Instagram is great.

2548
01:54:18,831 --> 01:54:20,240
You know,
I never been on facebook.

2549
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:21,800
never.
Never.

2550
01:54:21,850 --> 01:54:24,290
I have,
I hired two girls to help me with that.

2551
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:25,910
They sent dick pics to everybody.
Yeah.

2552
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:32,510
Whose idea was that first idea?
Was that somebody this year?

2553
01:54:32,810 --> 01:54:34,340
The dick pic guy?
Uh,

2554
01:54:34,341 --> 01:54:36,200
no dick pics are probably like
polaroids.

2555
01:54:36,201 --> 01:54:39,390
They probably drew my cave walls.
Probably dudes trace the outline of

2556
01:54:39,391 --> 01:54:41,950
their deck and threw rocks at women
common.

2557
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:46,300
We'll go look at it.
I've been ticked.

2558
01:54:46,301 --> 01:54:48,020
Pigs had been around as long as cameras
have been around.

2559
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:51,980
How long did the camera existed before
the first dude took a picture of his

2560
01:54:51,981 --> 01:54:54,140
dick with it.
How long a week?

2561
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:55,920
How long?
The first degree.

2562
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:58,610
I bet the first dick pic was to answer
that.

2563
01:54:58,670 --> 01:55:02,720
I honestly believe that if cameras are.
If they don't have to be operated by

2564
01:55:02,721 --> 01:55:04,640
more than one person at the time they're
created,

2565
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:08,330
I wouldn't give it more than a month
before a guy took a picture of his dick

2566
01:55:08,570 --> 01:55:11,870
from the making of the very first camera
to taking a photo of his dick.

2567
01:55:11,871 --> 01:55:15,110
I would say one month because otherwise,
how else you gotta look at your dick.

2568
01:55:15,290 --> 01:55:18,290
You have to use a mirror and those
mirrors back then were like looking into

2569
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:20,750
a pond.
you barely see what you look like.

2570
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:26,000
You know you'll get your reflection in a
car mirror like a car window.

2571
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:28,040
It's a nice storage.
I'm getting hungry now.

2572
01:55:29,960 --> 01:55:32,920
Look at this.
Two thousand five year old erotic,

2573
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:37,930
2,500 year old erotic graffiti.
Found an unlikely setting on the age g

2574
01:55:38,780 --> 01:55:40,340
and island.
Well,

2575
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,980
what's erotic about it as a dick?
Guys got a weird dick though.

2576
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:48,980
I think you should go to an ancient dr.
Throwing balls with the little squares

2577
01:55:49,471 --> 01:55:51,780
in his looks.
His balls with a grenade.

2578
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:53,220
yeah.
Who's has it?

2579
01:55:53,221 --> 01:55:56,130
That's a dick.
That can be a cactus over here.

2580
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,500
What's that?
Archeologists.

2581
01:55:58,430 --> 01:56:03,430
TiNa's art.
If they don't know shit that in a dick,

2582
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,230
if that's a dick,
are dicks have evolved?

2583
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,530
Imagine if we found out the dicks used
to look different.

2584
01:56:07,531 --> 01:56:10,800
They've changed.
They've changed shape like we find like

2585
01:56:10,801 --> 01:56:14,460
a petrified frozen dick from like a
million years ago and we.

2586
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:18,540
Oh my god,
what would it look like a million years

2587
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:19,800
ago we'll look for.
Has changed,

2588
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:21,720
right?
Neanderthals had those giant ass fucking

2589
01:56:21,721 --> 01:56:24,960
foreheads to look like a.
Like a forearm was growing off the top

2590
01:56:24,961 --> 01:56:27,330
of your brows.
Right?

2591
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:31,080
This big thing at the end of the faces
were different.

2592
01:56:31,081 --> 01:56:33,980
Their build were different.
What are their dicks were different that

2593
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:35,190
you could actually eat with it?

2594
01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:44,530
Put your hands exactly.
Push food and the amount that was

2595
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:48,900
watching an elephant eat bamboo ones and
the elephant.

2596
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:51,210
It's kind of interesting to see like you
don't.

2597
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:54,780
I don't think I realized until I saw an
elephant eat at the zoo,

2598
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:58,020
how much dexterity they have in that
trunk,

2599
01:56:58,440 --> 01:57:03,090
but he's stepping on this bamboo and
just tearing the leaves off like really

2600
01:57:03,091 --> 01:57:06,750
like unbelievably powerful.
It just rips them off with no effort at

2601
01:57:06,751 --> 01:57:08,910
all.
Bundles it up and then he was stuffing

2602
01:57:08,911 --> 01:57:11,520
it in his mouth and I was watching the
whole thing play out.

2603
01:57:11,521 --> 01:57:12,450
I was like,
wow,

2604
01:57:12,451 --> 01:57:15,750
what an interesting body part.
That trunk is.

2605
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:19,530
What other animal can feed itself with
his nose?

2606
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:24,920
Wrap its nose around,
leaves hold branches down with its feet

2607
01:57:25,170 --> 01:57:27,480
and pulled.
Just strip the leaves off,

2608
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:30,300
roll it up in a ball with its nose
already can do it.

2609
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,830
No,
you can't do it anymore.

2610
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,550
They don't try to think of an answer to
his question with me.

2611
01:57:36,710 --> 01:57:37,940
Oh,
about looking jewish.

2612
01:57:38,020 --> 01:57:40,460
What?
What is it about me that makes me look

2613
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,020
jewish?
I love the red.

2614
01:57:43,021 --> 01:57:45,690
If you're talking to him about his
religious past.

2615
01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:48,240
No.
When he was a young boy,

2616
01:57:48,241 --> 01:57:53,241
he lived in Israel and he spent a lot
young management say he spent like 12

2617
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:58,440
hours a day reading like ancient jewish
religious texts.

2618
01:57:58,441 --> 01:57:59,274
yeah.
He was a.

2619
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:04,700
He was in a very religious program.
He was seriously like a dedicated jus

2620
01:58:07,050 --> 01:58:10,440
like to learning judaea,
judaism to learning hebrew,

2621
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:13,500
like seriously dedicated.
Somewhere along the line he just woke up

2622
01:58:13,501 --> 01:58:14,970
and like,
what the fuck am I doing?

2623
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:17,280
Funny shit man.
It's interesting.

2624
01:58:17,281 --> 01:58:17,941
Is it like,
you know,

2625
01:58:17,941 --> 01:58:20,130
they say politics makes strange
bedfellows.

2626
01:58:20,131 --> 01:58:21,120
Will sodas,
comedy?

2627
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:24,510
Like when,
what regular world would you and him and

2628
01:58:24,511 --> 01:58:26,080
joey be friends.
Yeah.

2629
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:27,690
We'd have to work together.
You,

2630
01:58:27,790 --> 01:58:31,310
you'd to work wouldn't collide and in
other places know,

2631
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:33,700
unless we all had the same hobby,
you know?

2632
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:36,780
I mean how else do you like?
I know people from different worlds to

2633
01:58:36,781 --> 01:58:41,200
like the world of pool professional pool
and because pool players that I've known

2634
01:58:41,201 --> 01:58:42,070
for 20,

2635
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,410
30 years,
like those people in that world.

2636
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:47,180
I know those people,
but otherwise other worlds like you

2637
01:58:47,190 --> 01:58:49,780
gotta like do something they do,
right?

2638
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:50,171
Yeah.
Well,

2639
01:58:50,171 --> 01:58:52,950
I mean,
I noticed really a lot like a lot of the

2640
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:56,110
guys of your generation that,
uh,

2641
01:58:56,910 --> 01:58:59,980
they're very manly that when I,
when I,

2642
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:03,280
when I first started,
there was a lot of like nebbishy guy who

2643
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:07,600
talked about their mother and you know,
it's really changed is because come

2644
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:10,570
much,
much more masculine like burr burrs.

2645
01:59:10,571 --> 01:59:11,700
Very manly.
Yeah.

2646
01:59:11,780 --> 01:59:13,930
Yeah.
But there was always guys like lenny

2647
01:59:13,931 --> 01:59:15,130
clarke,
he was real manly,

2648
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:17,140
manly.
Well lenny clarke,

2649
01:59:17,650 --> 01:59:20,090
he could be like a bouncer and a
comedian.

2650
01:59:20,230 --> 01:59:22,180
Big man,
big savage.

2651
01:59:23,070 --> 01:59:23,890
um,
yeah,

2652
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:24,970
there's uh,
you know,

2653
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:26,730
I think this,
just like the doors open,

2654
01:59:26,731 --> 01:59:29,200
the fucking everybody now there's all
sorts of different shapes.

2655
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,930
I always tell him,
I had a podcast yesterday and the kid

2656
01:59:31,931 --> 01:59:34,060
was muslim and I said,
you know,

2657
01:59:34,061 --> 01:59:36,160
when I started out there were no muslim
comedians.

2658
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:38,380
I couldn't,
they wouldn't.

2659
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:42,700
When I started at 1980,
there was nobody I could think of.

2660
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:45,310
I mean,
remember when yaakov shamir was like a

2661
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:46,840
crazy thing to see.
Yeah.

2662
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:48,730
Oh my gosh.
From whatever country.

2663
01:59:48,900 --> 01:59:50,230
And you know,
what killed him,

2664
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:52,270
perish striker,
let's say a purse.

2665
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,790
Drake in Russia.
It was the same as here,

2666
01:59:54,970 --> 01:59:58,030
you know what he's been doing sets of
the store and he's fucking funny.

2667
01:59:58,360 --> 01:59:59,650
Good.
He's good man.

2668
01:59:59,651 --> 02:00:01,840
He's a good joke writer.
He writes good jokes.

2669
02:00:01,841 --> 02:00:04,360
He's a likable guy.
He's a nice guy.

2670
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:06,010
And uh,
I've,

2671
02:00:06,011 --> 02:00:09,430
I've seen him many times now over the
past few months.

2672
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:11,620
He's a real nice guy.
Yeah.

2673
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:14,590
You know,
but he went to branson to read it,

2674
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:16,440
to have a career there.
Well,

2675
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:17,940
he has a theater there,
right?

2676
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:20,320
They do at dinner shows and shit.
And he goes out and does standup.

2677
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:23,920
They do like three in the afternoon
shows that didn't get to bed by six.

2678
02:00:24,070 --> 02:00:25,390
He still looks great too,
guys.

2679
02:00:25,391 --> 02:00:26,770
Fucking healthy.
It looks good.

2680
02:00:27,530 --> 02:00:29,650
They do 3:00 PM shows.
No kid.

2681
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:31,890
You might be right.
I might be wrong.

2682
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:34,960
It might be feeding him fucking boiled
carrots and shit.

2683
02:00:36,500 --> 02:00:37,720
Get gum.
All their meals.

2684
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:39,730
That brand,
that places weird.

2685
02:00:39,810 --> 02:00:40,990
Has he been there?
No,

2686
02:00:41,200 --> 02:00:42,880
no,
I haven't been gone.

2687
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:45,050
It's like an elephant graveyard.
Well,

2688
02:00:45,051 --> 02:00:46,900
it's a weird,
like real religious place,

2689
02:00:46,901 --> 02:00:47,380
right?
Well,

2690
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:49,090
I didn't know that.
Isn't branson,

2691
02:00:49,091 --> 02:00:50,710
Missouri.
I polish it up.

2692
02:00:50,711 --> 02:00:52,450
Jamie,
it all super religious,

2693
02:00:53,490 --> 02:00:54,770
conservative,
you know,

2694
02:00:55,090 --> 02:00:59,650
kind of a midwest.
You don't really get too much

2695
02:00:59,651 --> 02:01:02,950
conservative without religion.
True.

2696
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,440
It's real.
You don't get too much.

2697
02:01:05,441 --> 02:01:08,770
Like watch your language,
watch your behavior,

2698
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:12,430
dress nice.
Don't say anything inappropriate.

2699
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:14,800
Don't say anything controversial without
religion.

2700
02:01:15,220 --> 02:01:20,220
Like you really only get that,
that sort of strict behavioral standards

2701
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,050
when they're applied to religion.
Like I was telling you about,

2702
02:01:23,051 --> 02:01:27,520
my friend who did the benefit,
his people are all religious.

2703
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:28,960
I'll tell you who he is after this is
over.

2704
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:33,010
I just don't want to blow the guy up.
He's a famous guy and his people are all

2705
02:01:33,011 --> 02:01:37,990
like really religious.
He's an athlete and so his idea of

2706
02:01:37,991 --> 02:01:41,240
what's acceptable and acceptable
involves what language you use,

2707
02:01:41,241 --> 02:01:43,370
like what words you use,
what subjects talk about.

2708
02:01:43,610 --> 02:01:45,620
That almost always comes with religion.
Yeah.

2709
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:49,400
You know,
to be like real button down and super

2710
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:51,380
judgmental.
Yeah,

2711
02:01:51,381 --> 02:01:52,214
yeah,
yeah.

2712
02:01:52,340 --> 02:01:55,430
Just not allowing anything risque or
controversial.

2713
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:58,670
Welcome to branson.
Let's have some fun.

2714
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:03,380
Jim stafford show was just show me a
photo.

2715
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:06,260
What does it say about the actual place
though?

2716
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:11,660
I've never seen any pictures of it.
You couldn't find anything about branson

2717
02:02:11,700 --> 02:02:12,533
being religious.

2718
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:16,310
Oh joe.
I'll tell you.

2719
02:02:16,311 --> 02:02:17,980
I love vegas.
I just do.

2720
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,110
It's fun and,
and out.

2721
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:20,120
Quit.
We got to do something.

2722
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:22,280
I want to come and see.
You know,

2723
02:02:22,290 --> 02:02:25,100
your foot or something.
Let me know when you,

2724
02:02:25,101 --> 02:02:27,380

when you're doing gigs from there in

2725
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:31,460
august with the laugh factory in june.
I told you with the brad garrett.

2726
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,180
Okay.

2727
02:02:33,250 --> 02:02:35,210
You have a fight in june?
No,

2728
02:02:35,211 --> 02:02:36,920
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

2729
02:02:36,921 --> 02:02:37,491
We'll figure it out.
What?

2730
02:02:37,491 --> 02:02:39,710
Good one.
And then we'll do like a gig together up

2731
02:02:39,711 --> 02:02:40,010
there.
Oh,

2732
02:02:40,010 --> 02:02:41,060
that'd be great.
Yeah.

2733
02:02:41,150 --> 02:02:41,983
should be fun.
Right?

2734
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:44,980
Do a to get on the friday and then come
back.

2735
02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:47,210
Dominic.
Yeah.

2736
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:50,570
There's some fun times to be had there.
Great restaurants too.

2737
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,240
Oh man.
Best know what they did.

2738
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:57,410
They went out and bought the best chefs
in the smart and you get to where the

2739
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:58,100
airport.

2740
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:01,400
You see these fucking big ass gordon
ramsay posters and all these other

2741
02:03:01,401 --> 02:03:05,720
chefs.
I know enrolled in the famous guys that

2742
02:03:05,721 --> 02:03:07,520
I've seen on the anthony bourdain show
and shit.

2743
02:03:08,470 --> 02:03:10,580
It's awesome and you can't get a bad
steak.

2744
02:03:10,610 --> 02:03:13,490
They're one of the major casinos there.
Stakes are off the charts.

2745
02:03:13,660 --> 02:03:15,890
What I used when I started there at a
six,

2746
02:03:15,891 --> 02:03:20,891
so at the comedy store,
it was all dollar 99 stakes,

2747
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:25,070
ninety nine cent breakfast.
It was all like shit food for people

2748
02:03:25,071 --> 02:03:27,200
that would just gambled.
Then it's completely changed.

2749
02:03:27,201 --> 02:03:29,150
Steve wynn,
that had a lot to do with it.

2750
02:03:29,151 --> 02:03:30,920
I think he is.
He is a visionary.

2751
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:36,220
Does a bunch of those guys that have
done a great job that the whole group,

2752
02:03:36,620 --> 02:03:38,940
like the cosmopolitan,
right?

2753
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:39,621
Right.
Yeah.

2754
02:03:39,621 --> 02:03:43,070
And then the mgm has a fantastic steak
place.

2755
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:47,270
A I,
I had the really expensive one just to

2756
02:03:47,271 --> 02:03:49,460
see how much better with a $260.

2757
02:03:49,490 --> 02:03:52,600
Colby beef where they might they massage
the,

2758
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,480
the,
the,

2759
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:55,670
the cow or the sphere.
The other.

2760
02:03:55,680 --> 02:03:58,910
Give it a fatty diet.
Give him a beer.

2761
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:01,790
Crazy.
It's good.

2762
02:04:02,040 --> 02:04:03,170
Tastes good though.
What is it,

2763
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:06,320
jamie?
I just got this place called the sight

2764
02:04:06,321 --> 02:04:08,510
and sound show.
They have all these religious shows

2765
02:04:08,511 --> 02:04:09,041
there.
Oh,

2766
02:04:09,041 --> 02:04:11,570
look at that.
I guess places bringing the bible to

2767
02:04:11,571 --> 02:04:13,550
life.
This is one of the big shows in branson,

2768
02:04:13,790 --> 02:04:18,020
bunch of shitty actors.
Whereas your mom was art show,

2769
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:19,130
moses.
Oh,

2770
02:04:19,131 --> 02:04:22,640
I think I need to go to that.
I need to go to that on acid.

2771
02:04:23,660 --> 02:04:27,710
That be awesome to take a pot brownie to
get just like crippling,

2772
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:32,240
scared high and then go to see this
would probably be amazing.

2773
02:04:32,241 --> 02:04:35,320
We need to film that for vice.
oh.

2774
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:37,710
Oh my god.
Smith.

2775
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:43,430
I just found something we can do.
Go to branson and we'll have a guy tried

2776
02:04:44,761 --> 02:04:48,300
to convert us.
I thought about going into one of those,

2777
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,770
uh,
on hollywood boulevard.

2778
02:04:49,771 --> 02:04:51,930
Just letting them,
just seeing what they did.

2779
02:04:51,931 --> 02:04:53,300
The dynamics.
Yeah.

2780
02:04:53,301 --> 02:04:55,590
Just to make it all the time when I
walked down there,

2781
02:04:55,591 --> 02:04:56,910
just hey,
take care of to take a flyer.

2782
02:04:56,911 --> 02:04:58,680
I just want to walk in one time and just
see what they do.

2783
02:04:58,740 --> 02:05:00,690
They might get you bro.
You think they'd catch me if I had a

2784
02:05:00,691 --> 02:05:02,950
microphone on or something?
Uh,

2785
02:05:03,200 --> 02:05:03,801
yeah.
Probably.

2786
02:05:03,801 --> 02:05:06,390
Probably rescue.
And then they'll fuck you if they find

2787
02:05:06,391 --> 02:05:08,670
the mic.
So they do,

2788
02:05:09,330 --> 02:05:10,163
dude.
Um,

2789
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:12,990
which that we might lose you to
scientology.

2790
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:15,290
Then you might become a mole and you
come in here.

2791
02:05:15,310 --> 02:05:18,570
When we talk shit about tom cruise,
he sent a text to these people and then

2792
02:05:18,571 --> 02:05:20,400
they get mad and attack us.
Maybe it's already here.

2793
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:25,150
They move tom cruise to some secret
hideaway.

2794
02:05:25,210 --> 02:05:26,680
Did you hear about this?
Yeah.

2795
02:05:26,681 --> 02:05:29,860
This is a recent thing.
He moved into l dot ron hubbard's

2796
02:05:29,861 --> 02:05:32,350
mansion in england.
He's like fixing it up.

2797
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:37,650
L ron hubbard had an estate from which
he prepared for the tetons to come here

2798
02:05:38,081 --> 02:05:43,081
from far away galaxies to reclaim their
frozen souls that melted in the volcano

2799
02:05:43,661 --> 02:05:46,990
or whatever the fuck the story is.
Shitty ass writer.

2800
02:05:47,050 --> 02:05:49,990
Look at this.
pull up the title of this.

2801
02:05:50,060 --> 02:05:55,060
So a sprawling english estate fit for a
king of hollywood,

2802
02:05:56,140 --> 02:06:00,520
tom cruise set to pull up stakes and
move to st hill manor,

2803
02:06:00,700 --> 02:06:05,440
the former home of founder l dot ron
hubbard at Church of scientology uk

2804
02:06:05,441 --> 02:06:09,910
headquarters.
Who out of anybody who has kept it

2805
02:06:09,911 --> 02:06:14,911
together in the face of being a part of
a fucking whack a do cult like tom

2806
02:06:16,961 --> 02:06:19,840
cruise.
The fucking guy never answered a

2807
02:06:19,870 --> 02:06:20,830
question about it.

2808
02:06:20,980 --> 02:06:23,110
It doesn't.
He's talked about it briefly over the

2809
02:06:23,110 --> 02:06:24,370
years and every time it's been a
mistake,

2810
02:06:25,090 --> 02:06:27,850
but if he just keeps his fucking mouth
shut and acts,

2811
02:06:27,851 --> 02:06:30,820
he acts his little dick off and he looks
amazing.

2812
02:06:30,970 --> 02:06:32,400
He's a good actor.
He looks amazing.

2813
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:34,540
He's in his fifties,
looks like he's 30 years old.

2814
02:06:34,570 --> 02:06:37,000
He looks amazing,
and he's a great actor.

2815
02:06:37,090 --> 02:06:38,100
That fucking,
what is it?

2816
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:41,770
The tomorrow movie?
Edge of tomorrow that was always called.

2817
02:06:42,040 --> 02:06:45,430
That is a very good science fiction
movie and he's excellent in it.

2818
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,380
He's fucking good,
man.

2819
02:06:48,010 --> 02:06:49,960
That's amazing.
If,

2820
02:06:50,260 --> 02:06:54,730
if he wasn't in a wacky cult,
if he was just like a regular guy,

2821
02:06:54,790 --> 02:06:57,400
would he be even bigger?
I mean,

2822
02:06:57,401 --> 02:07:00,430
was he bigger before?
What's bigger like.

2823
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:01,211
Well,
I know he.

2824
02:07:01,211 --> 02:07:03,670
There was a drop off after that whole
glib thing.

2825
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:07,240
Remember when he was accusing brooke
shields of being like,

2826
02:07:07,241 --> 02:07:12,241
of making a big mistake by taking psych,
psychotropic drugs for depression.

2827
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:15,940
Remember that you had to make a comeback
and tropic thunder.

2828
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:18,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

2829
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:19,540
That was the comeback.
Well,

2830
02:07:19,541 --> 02:07:24,541
it was because he really fucked up.
He got on tv with matt lauer and he did

2831
02:07:24,821 --> 02:07:29,821
this really weird interview man where he
talked about like the importance of not

2832
02:07:30,610 --> 02:07:35,610
taking drugs to treat depression and it
was fucking range,

2833
02:07:36,461 --> 02:07:38,290
man.
It was really strange.

2834
02:07:38,291 --> 02:07:38,980
he's like,
matt,

2835
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:40,180
matt,
you're being glib,

2836
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:42,130
like lick.
But he was.

2837
02:07:42,160 --> 02:07:45,100
It was.
It was so awkward and goofY because you

2838
02:07:45,101 --> 02:07:46,060
realize like,
oh,

2839
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:50,770
you don't even know how crazy you are.
Like you're constantly surrounded by

2840
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,930
agents,
other actors,

2841
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:56,170
managers and people you love and people
that love you.

2842
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:00,130
So when you're sitting there tAlking to
a guy like matt lauer and you're

2843
02:08:00,131 --> 02:08:05,131
explaIning why brooke shields shouldn't
take medicine to treat her depression

2844
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:10,710
because you believe that a frozen
phaeton was dropped into a volcano by a

2845
02:08:11,501 --> 02:08:15,940
fucking god of thunder from some
university was shaped like a thimble or

2846
02:08:15,941 --> 02:08:16,950
something.
I mean w w,

2847
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:21,100
w what?
LAuer wanted to fight him when he called

2848
02:08:21,101 --> 02:08:25,420
hIm and he wanted to take tom cruise in
a wrestling match when actor called them

2849
02:08:25,421 --> 02:08:27,070
glip.
C'mon on gets arm wrestling.

2850
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,960
Is it really?
I think I saw it mostly a wrestling

2851
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:36,420
match is he wanted to wrestle it.
Told that to andy cohen.

2852
02:08:36,430 --> 02:08:37,420
He said,
hm,

2853
02:08:38,150 --> 02:08:40,420
okay,
stop these some gay stuff there.

2854
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:44,190
Why do you want to wrestle a guy?
I just want to get on top you and

2855
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:47,210
doMinated you.
Call me glib about you.

2856
02:08:47,211 --> 02:08:48,490
Choke on my dick.

2857
02:08:52,420 --> 02:08:55,600
The moment he thought,
can I take him in a wrestling match?

2858
02:08:55,601 --> 02:08:59,350
Could I tackle him on the set?
What do you imagine how dumb you have to

2859
02:08:59,351 --> 02:09:01,660
be?
The guy calls you glib and your reaction

2860
02:09:01,661 --> 02:09:04,390
is you want to attack him that you want.
I was thinking,

2861
02:09:04,391 --> 02:09:07,720
can I take him?
Can I take him male posturing?

2862
02:09:07,721 --> 02:09:08,980
Dom,
it's very dangerous.

2863
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:11,380
I can't imagine doing that to matt
lauer.

2864
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:14,040
I would love matt lauer just tackling
someone on show and just ground and

2865
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:16,670
pound.
I would love to see that matt lauer just

2866
02:09:16,930 --> 02:09:18,490
passes.
God moves to full mount,

2867
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:21,730
starts dropping elbows on people.
I don't think of him as a tough guy.

2868
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:24,660
He's definitely not.
I worked with him a lot of times when he

2869
02:09:24,661 --> 02:09:27,260
used to be a guy in philly.
We hAve the news guy and billy,

2870
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:29,590
it might be a tough guy,
but I mean I just don't think of him as

2871
02:09:29,591 --> 02:09:31,840
a guy who had assault someone for
calling them glib.

2872
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:33,490
You didn't call them a dump.
Fuck.

2873
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:34,131
Like,
listen,

2874
02:09:34,131 --> 02:09:34,871
you dump.
Fuck,

2875
02:09:34,871 --> 02:09:37,330
you don't know shit about medicine.
I'm a scientologist.

2876
02:09:37,331 --> 02:09:38,164
Okay,
dude,

2877
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:41,500
I know.
Fuck these science psychologists,

2878
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:45,550
scientists,
scientology's all you need.

2879
02:09:45,560 --> 02:09:46,990
Goddammit.
Brooke shields,

2880
02:09:49,360 --> 02:09:50,500
puerco,
tom cruise.

2881
02:09:50,650 --> 02:09:54,010
But it's amazing that he has stayed
relevant.

2882
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:56,320
I mean there was that big drop off after
that,

2883
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:58,240
but then his talent pulled them through
again.

2884
02:09:58,241 --> 02:10:00,520
He did a bunch of good movies.
Maybe it's because he does his own

2885
02:10:00,521 --> 02:10:03,070
stunts,
so he's just a crazy motherfucker and

2886
02:10:03,071 --> 02:10:05,380
people like them because of that.
He definitely does and he does

2887
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:07,390
motorcycles.
Stents does some dangerous shift,

2888
02:10:07,391 --> 02:10:10,840
the playing thing,
all those mission impossible movies done

2889
02:10:10,841 --> 02:10:13,120
a lot of stuff.
He does a lot of stuff.

2890
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:14,890
He's a bad motherfucker,
man.

2891
02:10:15,190 --> 02:10:17,530
He's crazy as shit,
but he's a bad motherfucker.

2892
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:20,020
You can be both,
but he was.

2893
02:10:20,050 --> 02:10:21,970
He started in taps,
I think it was.

2894
02:10:21,971 --> 02:10:24,190
Do you remember that?
Yeah.

2895
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:25,630
Well,
he's been in a bunch of movies,

2896
02:10:25,631 --> 02:10:28,700
man.
He was in That movie with ralph macho.

2897
02:10:29,200 --> 02:10:31,930
What was that fucking movie where
they're all like greasers and shit.

2898
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:34,100
The law,
god dammit.

2899
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:36,020
Outsiders,
the outsiders.

2900
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:38,360
He was great in that.
He was always great.

2901
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:41,690
It's fucking great actor is greater,
but I'm telling you that edge of

2902
02:10:41,691 --> 02:10:45,080
tomorrow movie is bad ass is one of the
best science fiction movies I've seen in

2903
02:10:45,081 --> 02:10:49,460
a long time and I think a lot of the
scifi geeks might have ignored it a

2904
02:10:49,461 --> 02:10:53,030
little bit because it's a tom cruise
movie because I think if it was just

2905
02:10:53,031 --> 02:10:57,110
like some really respected guy that
maybe people didn't know about,

2906
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:58,370
maybe would,
uh,

2907
02:10:58,400 --> 02:11:00,680
would be appreciated more.
I really believe that.

2908
02:11:00,681 --> 02:11:05,240
I think that sometimes a guy like that
almost hurts a movie that's that good.

2909
02:11:05,270 --> 02:11:07,250
You know,
you expect him in like a blockbuster,

2910
02:11:07,251 --> 02:11:09,350
like a mission.
Impossible one of those action movies

2911
02:11:09,530 --> 02:11:12,440
totally makes sense.
But he's so god damn good in this movie.

2912
02:11:12,441 --> 02:11:14,480
I don't think people give them the
credit that he deserves.

2913
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:17,390
It's a good movie if you're into those
kind of movies.

2914
02:11:17,391 --> 02:11:19,570
Like I love a good scifi movie and
that's a,

2915
02:11:19,910 --> 02:11:22,790
that's a great one.
It's one of the best scifi movies over

2916
02:11:22,791 --> 02:11:25,240
the last few decades.
When you say so jeremy?

2917
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,450
Yeah.
They're getting ready to start to make

2918
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:28,460
another one.
Supposedly it,

2919
02:11:28,461 --> 02:11:33,461
they're working on it right now
in this alien movie foot.

2920
02:11:34,311 --> 02:11:35,830
A bit of humor.
Oh,

2921
02:11:35,880 --> 02:11:40,880
kill us.
So when you go into city Australia and

2922
02:11:41,901 --> 02:11:43,990
what's the Oregon?
What's the sidney?

2923
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:46,160
Uh,
I think I'm doing sydney opera house one

2924
02:11:46,161 --> 02:11:49,760
night.
he's doing the sydney and perth and I

2925
02:11:49,761 --> 02:11:52,510
know I have a gig,
a newcastle in the daytime.

2926
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:54,380
Daytime bar gig,
which will be funny.

2927
02:11:54,390 --> 02:11:55,223
Oh,
that'S hilarious.

2928
02:11:55,240 --> 02:11:58,820
Yeah.
