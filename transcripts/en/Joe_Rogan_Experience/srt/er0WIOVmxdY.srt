1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,590
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,221
Oh,

3
00:00:02,221 --> 00:00:03,660
that was another thing
they found recently.

4
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:03,990
Man,

5
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,130
I wanted to talk about this.

6
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
They found evidence that a mass amount
of people were killed in London in the 15

7
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,810
hundreds by a volcano.

8
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,190
This is 1258 there was a
colossal volcano in 1258 wow.

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,490
This is amazing,

10
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,324
man.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,920
So this is a new discovery
that such a massive global,

12
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,640
national,

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,640
natural disaster has been identified
in a small area of east London.

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,780
That's incredible,

15
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:37,614
man.

16
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,840
That is amazing shit.

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:41,971
Yeah,

18
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:42,990
we don't know too much.

19
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,280
You know when they,

20
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,840
when they really talk about history,

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,460
like what we really know about the past,

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,181
man,

23
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,230
we don't really know that much.

24
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,010
We don't know.

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,390
We just make a fucking assumptions

26
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,170
and every other week we come up
with a new fucking assumption.

27
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,460
It's amazing how much we're fine,

28
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:58,380
but that fucking tape a
Mars either that looks,

29
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:58,820
can't keep them.

30
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,653
Me Too.

31
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,610
I don't give a fuck.

32
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,160
You got to go to bars now,

33
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,000
now $14 billion when all this shit we
got going on is fucking country bars for

34
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:09,211
what?

35
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:09,860
Who gives a fuck?

36
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,650
My boss.

37
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,431
I'm sitting there going,

38
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:12,201
this a [inaudible] gazing.

39
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:13,034
It's fucking table.

40
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,280
They made this in Burbank.

41
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,653
Well this is what I think.

42
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,501
I think first of all,

43
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,040
yeah,

44
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,930
they did go and it's awesome.

45
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,390
And when you,

46
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:24,390
you spend money on scientific
innovation for space travel,

47
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,490
you're dealing with the cream of the
crop of people that are trying to figure

48
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:34,491
out how to manipulate space and matter
and transport things and how to,

49
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:35,880
you know,

50
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,680
you're dealing with the most,

51
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,870
the the most knowledgeable
scientists on earth.

52
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,590
$2 strived and Joey,

53
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:46,920
come on.

54
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,020
I mean I'm serious and silly.

55
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:50,640
Every,

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,750
let me tell you this.

57
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,690
Everything that they do when they
got to go with the fucking price,

58
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,150
I ex what it has to do fucking age.

59
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,140
We've got diseases,

60
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,060
we got fat kids running around and

61
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,520
March.

62
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Definitely we should pay attention to
that are saying we should go and explore

63
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,550
the universe.

64
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,530
Oh Bernie,

65
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,850
a little by little will
fucking die in here dog.

66
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,530
This country is fucking dying.

67
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,693
We got time.

68
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,350
I don't give a fuck what goes on in Mars.

69
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,810
I don't give a fuck what goes
on ugly and loved it either.

70
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:22,000
In 1529 I'm from the Church of
what's happening now I'm buck.

71
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,490
If you care about that shit,

72
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,480
you got too much fucking
time on your hands.

73
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,653
What's that got to do?

74
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,321
We've got kids.

75
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:29,154
We got houses.

76
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,330
Shut the fuck down.

77
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,490
You got billions of
dollars to go to model.

78
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,600
Give a fuck about eyes.

79
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,460
Why don't you get this
excited about the wars?

80
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,960
Because that costs a thousand times.

81
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,260
Don't get excited about and all that
shit because it doesn't have to.

82
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,181
What the fuck?

83
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:43,680
Not that they'd been fighting for 10
years and I'm still paying $5 for fucking

84
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,040
gas guy that I didn't do.

85
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,880
The money we're spending
on the war is a billion,

86
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,000
billion,

87
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,370
billions and billions of dollars.

88
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,010
Every fucking year I'm going to Mars,

89
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,930
Afghanistan,

90
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:55,680
Mars,

91
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:55,951
things,

92
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:56,850
a positive thing.

93
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:57,684
The Mars thing,

94
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,750
they're going to get
innovation out of this project.

95
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,970
I need them in,

96
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,230
in everything else.

97
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,530
It's going to eventually lead to
who knows what kind of space travel.

98
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,520
Eventually we're going to have

99
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,050
to do with us.

100
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,580
That's what the problem say is we can't
buy shit that got not in the pocket door

101
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:14,920
that this is why I care about it,

102
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,070
because it's cool as fuck.

103
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,360
When that thing lands on Mars and starts
taking pictures and sending it through

104
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:23,020
the sky and I see a room full of people
who've worked on nothing but this for

105
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,430
years jumping up and down here,

106
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,690
it's fucking awesome and I pick
up an envelope at the thing.

107
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,380
All right,

108
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,520
you're going to jump up and down to
somebody landed and mark kick a bunch of

109
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:37,280
fucking gigs that they were white with
blue shirts on and shit jumping up and

110
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,360
that's there.

111
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
That's what NASA is.

112
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,010
Matthew understanding put together,

113
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,660
and I appreciate travel.

114
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:43,991
You know,

115
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:47,230
10 years ago we hung out for years and
you would talk about the moon landing was

116
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:47,650
fake.

117
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,020
Now all of a sudden you're
happy about bucking wise guy.

118
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,003
Come on,

119
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,210
give me a fucking break.

120
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:54,560
What are they all connected system

121
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,960
that goes out of her day?

122
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,580
It's waste of thought.

123
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,230
We've got bigger things to fry.

124
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,210
Gas is $5 a tech.

125
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,111
We got this note,

126
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:05,281
Rob,

127
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:08,010
some guy who's a fucking
commy cocks up a wall.

128
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,940
Fuck from Idaho,

129
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:10,451
Utah.

130
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,580
What the fuck is from against Obama?

131
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,091
Go into,

132
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,631
that's going on.

133
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,141
Good days.

134
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:14,770
His wife,

135
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,710
cause she's making fat.

136
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,870
Kids get fucking skinny.

137
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,740
That's it.

138
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,640
I mean what the fuck?

139
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,600
What the fuck?

140
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,920
We don't even have a president.

141
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,800
We know we don't have somebody to both
for the next four years and we're worried

142
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:24,640
about fucking Mars.

143
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:29,230
Joe Rogan rarely about fuck what happened
in England and 1529 we need to fucking

144
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,880
know what's going to happen
at the next three years.

145
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:31,893
You know what dog?

146
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,590
You're right.

147
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,060
I'm about to have a baby and I'm fucking
scared because what is he going to have

148
00:04:36,061 --> 00:04:36,761
in 40 years?

149
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:37,390
What we're going to have,

150
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,310
we're going to be getting
fucked in the ass by Arabs,

151
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,600
but a bunch of white people.

152
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,980
We went to go see if the
Arabs are jumping up and down,

153
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,031
dare fucking gone.

154
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:47,050
Wait Til we get those wipe.

155
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,240
If they get excited like
that about landing in Mars,

156
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,580
wait til they sniffed
this Arab asshole has,

157
00:04:51,581 --> 00:04:52,810
they're sucking my dick.

158
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,110
Cause my learning has,

159
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,730
does my daughter to have to learn Spanish
or does she have to learn fucking Arab

160
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,080
in the next 20 fucking years?

161
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,370
That's what I'm worried about,

162
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:00,910
dog.

163
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,000
There's my kid have to go to school
with 80 fucking foreigners or does she?

164
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,930
That's what I worry about.

165
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,220
So fuck march bro.

166
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,620
I want to hear about fucking Mars and
a bunch of fucking waspy fucked with

167
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:12,250
Glasser's jumping up and
down cause we landed on Mars.

168
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,400
There's a fucking mortgage
is upside down his country.

169
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,060
Fucking pile of the students.

170
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,030
Are you going to stop doing stand up?

171
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,170
No,

172
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,070
I'm not going to stop doing.

173
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,530
So why would they stop
pulling with rover on Mars?

174
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,390
But what's mine's got Joey's.

175
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,680
That's what they do.

176
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,580
That's what they know.

177
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:29,370
Level arts eggs,

178
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,470
they're already in

179
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,640
their art is creating something that can
fly through fucking space for a year.

180
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,710
That's great land on your fucking time.

181
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,530
And I think they pay me.

182
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,560
These mother fuckers are using
my money to go to fucking Mars.

183
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,460
They take half of your bucket check for
taking half of my bucket check to go to

184
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:48,821
Mars.

185
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:49,360
Motherfucker.

186
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,680
You get angry when you,

187
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,330
they take that money and they go to war.

188
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,770
I don't even think about it,

189
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:57,530
but war is something that more
than we need war more fun.

190
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,801
What?

191
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,970
How much money do we make
by going tomorrow when we
were to put a burger king on

192
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:01,970
why we think we need more,

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,833
what are we going to put on?

194
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,120
How are we going to pick up an envelope
is they're in a fucking Juliet's happy

195
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,541
right now,

196
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,170
but what's going on in God
cast is sponsored by ear
doctors all across America

197
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:17,171
and the conspiracy copters and hired
Julie to make people blow their ear drums

198
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:19,190
out.

199
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,023
That pissed

200
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,540
so many things going on in this regard.

201
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,880
Schools at closing,

202
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,380
fucking people see moral cities,

203
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,791
a clone,

204
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,690
human Bester and we gotta go to
fucking what bars to give a fuck.

205
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,310
Listen,

206
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,561
Joey,

207
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,680
I said I support your
hubris on us and listen bro,

208
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,440
I don't mind.

209
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,690
We've got to send pre Puerto Ricans.

210
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,830
I would establish a ride.

211
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,090
That's what needs to be done.

212
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:44,410
I'm going to blow up a fucking building
or three black guys establish a wrap.

213
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,253
That's what it needs to be done.

214
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,900
Wore his money to fucking bottom line.

215
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,580
The square root of war guy is Didas
and we've all known that Adidas,

216
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,170
that's the square root of money.

217
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,340
I don't see any DDAS and us going to
Mars except taking a bunch of rich people

218
00:06:58,341 --> 00:06:59,430
and charge them to take them to,

219
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,011
there's a quilt.

220
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:01,160
Let me explain to you.

221
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,780
Got To every fucking drone is flying
in Pakistan and taken out al Qaeda.

222
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,370
If you believe in that shit bills every,

223
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,090
I agreed by scientists and that's
beautiful and I'm with you.

224
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,940
If you want to argue
about keeping people safe,

225
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,350
the best way to keep people safe.

226
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:15,471
Look,

227
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:15,891
I'm not a,

228
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:19,880
I'm not saying that I advocate drones
because fuck load of civilians have died

229
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,140
from the use of drone attack,

230
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,230
but they eventually get that shit
wired to the point where they can kill

231
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:25,400
everybody they want to kill.

232
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,440
That's where it's the scientists that
are involved in making that shit at the

233
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:32,600
same scientists that are
involved in making all sorts of,

234
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,410
I love in spacecraft
Aircrafts and loving that.

235
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,680
Then making the technology.

236
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:37,041
Man,

237
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,851
you want to kill somebody?

238
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:38,210
You make up.

239
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,610
I want to see the bullet
that don't need a gun for it.

240
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,310
I just got to go like
business and a hitching.

241
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,280
Your head blows up.

242
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,720
I appreciate the scientist,

243
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,830
but not right now.

244
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,810
Billions of dollars to go to Mars.

245
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,680
We're only that Joey.

246
00:07:48,681 --> 00:07:52,200
That is a fraction of
what our military budget.

247
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,430
It's a title attached
fighting for our freedom.

248
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,260
What does Mars has to do with us?

249
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,390
It's a Martian going
to come back to Vegas,

250
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,680
so that's a crazy thing to say.

251
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,110
You are sending them it die.

252
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,020
One though.

253
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,520
The military is fighting for our freedom.

254
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:07,220
Is that why we're in countries that have
absolutely nothing to do with and he's,

255
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,540
that's why and we invaded down.

256
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:08,651
It's,

257
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:09,410
come on man.

258
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,360
That's crazy side.

259
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:11,630
So that's fucking flag brother.

260
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,561
We're good.

261
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:13,250
We're bad.

262
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,180
We got to kill some much.

263
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,980
You got to break a fucking few omelets
stuff to fucking make an album.

264
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,590
You got to break some
eggs to make a few amens.

265
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,940
Whatever they're doing,

266
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,770
it's a lot better than fucking,

267
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,850
they're selling drugs.

268
00:08:22,851 --> 00:08:25,100
The CIU sells coke at
least that make them money,

269
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,963
Mars and got another,

270
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,221
here's the big thing,

271
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:27,600
Joe.

272
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,540
And every time,

273
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,990
every time they send something to like
Mars or the urge do these missions,

274
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:36,700
they are also doing hundreds of
experiments and these experiments are

275
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,860
experiments that we can't do,

276
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,803
you know,

277
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,390
down on earth where in a lot of these
experiments lead to other things that do

278
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:46,211
help us out,

279
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,860
like cures for cancer
and fucking time travel.

280
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:48,931
Well,

281
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,130
let's get the cool listen,

282
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,600
judge,

283
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,880
to be a dollar fit's going to be,

284
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:56,280
it's going to come a point in time if we
follow the path that we're on now where

285
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,190
we might not be living on
this fucking planet anymore,

286
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,370
we're human beings might
pollute this motherfucker.

287
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,690
The point where we're going to want to
escape and what they're going to do,

288
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,220
is it going to send shit to Mars,

289
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:08,970
to terraform just like they did in the
movie aliens and they're going to put a

290
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:12,540
fucking fake atmosphere on Mars and that's
going to bear a little escape colony.

291
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:12,750
Yeah.

292
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,420
Can I ask you the question?

293
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,253
Well,

294
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,900
what's he got to do with us?

295
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm going to be dead.

296
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,321
I don't care.

297
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:18,871
He'll be fine.

298
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,890
I don't even know what else to do it.

299
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,060
I'm alive right now.

300
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,470
And when something lands on Mars,

301
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:23,460
I get geeked out.

302
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:23,710
Yeah.

303
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,840
I want to just see that shit.

304
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,770
I get names out.

305
00:09:25,771 --> 00:09:26,610
Looking at the photos.

306
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:27,200
I'm like that,

307
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,230
that land.

308
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:29,850
Has it ever been seen before?

309
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,481
Is it like,

310
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,730
is there have been people that
have walked on looks like fuck it,

311
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,510
Arizona as well?

312
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:33,960
You know,

313
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,850
it does look like Arizona,

314
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:36,020
but there is,

315
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,170
there's a real theory that's a fascinating
theory that Mars used to inhabit life

316
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:42,360
and then it used to had an atmosphere,

317
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,890
but it was hit by an asteroid.

318
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:44,960
And uh,

319
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,880
that's one of the reasons why they want
to keep sending things there and get to

320
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:48,211
task.

321
00:09:48,211 --> 00:09:51,480
Because if it was above a planet
that supported life like ours,

322
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,160
but then it was hit by an asteroid,

323
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,560
we realized that we've,

324
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:57,270
we've had mass extinctions on this planet,

325
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,850
at least two of them that
were caused by asteroids,

326
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,511
you know,

327
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,940
hundreds of millions of years ago
and then 65 million years ago.

328
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,610
And they know that there's been
some just doozies that have landed,

329
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,720
but it's possible that one could
land that just kills the whole thing.

330
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,571
That's a wrap.

331
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,321
Let me ask you something,

332
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,040
Bro.

333
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,641
What's that dot.

334
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,620
To do are,

335
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:12,840
okay.

336
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,190
Can you sell an asteroid?

337
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,400
Could you bring an asteroid to a check
cashing senate dogs and you want me to

338
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,490
get my fucking money fucking as to
what was going to vote for this year.

339
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,061
I mean,

340
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:21,750
I don't want,

341
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,190
could you fill in a right in Doug?

342
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:23,850
Stan hope.

343
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:23,980
Yeah,

344
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,930
that's what I was thinking it.

345
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,853
Doug Stanhope.

346
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,723
Yeah,

347
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,880
I can do any of you see what's going on
in this country and we could get a lot

348
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:31,680
of people to down on this country.

349
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,514
Joe Rogan,

350
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,250
intelligent guy.

351
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,670
I'm a fucking Momo and I know
that those both of them a bumps.

352
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,070
You're an intelligent guy.

353
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,860
You just looking at my face and told
me you are not confident about anybody

354
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:44,790
who's running for president.

355
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:45,510
This country.

356
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,990
You and another fucking
million people feel that way.

357
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,760
Sorry about that chocolate bar.

358
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:51,340
Fucking me up.

359
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,950
You know?

360
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,783
It's all right man.

361
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,610
I know what you're doing.

362
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,443
Just having fun.

363
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,631
No,

364
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:55,841
no,

365
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:56,674
no.

366
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,750
Fuck No.
