1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,170
Dude,
I'm so happy to be here.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,470
Dude.
I'm so happy you're here.

3
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:04,930
I've been reading your book and it's
fucking excellent.

4
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,160
You're a really good writer.

5
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,020
Thank you so much.
I killed myself doing that though.

6
00:00:09,021 --> 00:00:10,880
That is the hardest thing I've ever done
in my life.

7
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,100
How long did it take?
That two years.

8
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,990
Wow.
And when I got the deal,

9
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:19,991
I had this delusional idea that it would
be like writing 25,000 word essays and

10
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,580
this was so wrong.
This was so,

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,160
so,
so much harder than anything I'd ever

12
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,990
done.
Why was it so much harder than writing

13
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,070
essays?
Well,

14
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,470
when you write essays,
you are doing like these kinds of short

15
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:31,520
things.
It's limited.

16
00:00:31,521 --> 00:00:32,900
You have a beginning,
a middle and an end.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,030
No characters,
no dialogue.

18
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:36,560
You know,
simple narrative.

19
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,970
Where does this man like keeping a plot
together over 300 pages and then that

20
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,200
plot is your life,
which by definition has no plot.

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,040
Right?

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,060
Oh,
that makes sense.

23
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,141
Yeah,
it was.

24
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:51,470
It hard to recall all the moments in
your life and do them justice

25
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,770
so hard.
And also for,

26
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,570
for this book,
because I work as a journalist,

27
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,950
I fact checked it as best I could and
nothing is more personally painful than

28
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:03,910
fact checking the ends of various
friendships and relationships and

29
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,680
realizing what a jerk you were at the
time.

30
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,420
Yeah,
I can only imagine.

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,530
Yeah.
I don't want to do that.

32
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,220
Like,
Oh man,

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,350
I had a whole victimization narrative.
Oh that was quite the quite wrong think.

34
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,130
Probably did too.
Everybody does.

35
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,540
You know everybody,
I mean it's,

36
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,090
it's,
it's really strange when you go back and

37
00:01:22,091 --> 00:01:25,060
talk to people that you haven't talked
to for a long time and you're like,

38
00:01:25,061 --> 00:01:26,000
okay,
what is your,

39
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,160
and you know,
no,

40
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:30,340
all judgments aside.
Let's just give me your version of what

41
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,450
happened and I'll tell you what I think
happened and you know,

42
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,020
I call my God,
I don't know what the fuck the truth is

43
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,854
anymore.

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah.
I have this one thing where there was

45
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:42,440
this one girl,
she recalled something and she recalled

46
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:47,150
it one way and then when she realized
that it was actually two days later than

47
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:49,070
she thought it was,
which made it look like there was an

48
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:50,930
article she had written,
which had contradicted it.

49
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,030
She kept insisting it hadn't happened.
And I was like,

50
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:54,470
man,
here's your twitter.

51
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,450
Here's my twitter,
here's the twitter of the two other

52
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:58,700
people who are at brunch.
Here's the email confirming it had

53
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,950
happened on this day.
And finally she was like,

54
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,120
I just give up.
I give up,

55
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,103
but I don't remember it.

56
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Yeah,
it's a,

57
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,770
it's very strange when people are
confronted by that fact too.

58
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,001
Yeah.
I had a,

59
00:02:11,001 --> 00:02:13,220
um,
a friend that I'm no longer friends

60
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:14,480
with.
It insisted something.

61
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:16,280
And then when my other friend jumped in
and said,

62
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,860
that's not what happened at all.
It is.

63
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,650
It was a psychedelic drug talk.
I'm trying to avoid beat around the

64
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:23,780
Bush,
like I'm on regular radio or something.

65
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,650
But,
uh,

66
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,820
he was insisting that he,
uh,

67
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,200
got me on this a psychedelic drug the
first time in my,

68
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,360
my other friend was like,
um,

69
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,110
no,
that was mine.

70
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,150
It was my drugs.
I was there like,

71
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,880
what are you talking about man?
And then he just sort of stopped talking

72
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:38,690
to us,

73
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,650
just like walked off and it comes back
later with a new subject.

74
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,460
Well,
people love

75
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,390
to,
you know,

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,590
they love somehow or another to get
glory from the past and lucky somehow or

77
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:50,600
another it didn't.
It's one of those things that never

78
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,790
works.
Sort of like name dropping,

79
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,710
like name dropping has never worked
ever.

80
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,440
No one has ever said,
I'm really good friends with Leonardo

81
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,000
Dicaprio.
And someone's gone,

82
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,950
Whoa,

83
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,740
let me give you a movie now.
Fucking amazing.

84
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,570
No,
immediately people go,

85
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,250
oh,
this guy's a name dropper.

86
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,680
You know?
Or he just happens to say it.

87
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,140
It happens to be true.
There's a fine line,

88
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,420
but everybody knows what the difference
is.

89
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,950
Like when you're a name dropper comes,
he can,

90
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,250
you could smell it in a sentence,
you know,

91
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,900
it's just like,
it comes off in the air.

92
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,270
So this book is,
um,

93
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,310
it's,
it's fucking super intimate.

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,200
Like you,
you like just,

95
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,300
just cut the skin away and open your
chest up and just the whole world could

96
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:32,530
see your soul.
You know,

97
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,640
you,
you peeled it out.

98
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,160
I tried my best.
I mean I just wanted to do something

99
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:37,370
honest.
You know what?

100
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:39,430
It's definitely that I guess.
I mean,

101
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,050
I don't know.
I wasn't there obviously.

102
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,650
Um,
two years is a long time to write

103
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,220
something.

104
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,470
Like did you,
how many times did you have to go back

105
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:50,920
over it and oh God,
like seven drafts and there's a hundred

106
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:54,400
pages of cuts from this book too.
That's in another word file that I might

107
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,030
nine seven day for other essays.
But it was like over and over and you

108
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,040
know,
because I had never written a book

109
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,300
before,
I didn't,

110
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,210
I didn't realize,
you know,

111
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,520
how much extra you right.
I feel like I was like building a block

112
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:12,820
of marble basically out of words.
And then I had to like cut away at the

113
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:14,650
horrible ugly block of Marble I had
made.

114
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,840
And then finally something cool emerged.
Yeah.

115
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:21,010
They all say that all the great writers
say that like my friend Steve or always

116
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,380
use this quote,
you have to kill your babies.

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,250
Yeah,
exactly.

118
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,083
That's what they say,
right?

119
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,430
That's like the common writers
conversation.

120
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,240
Kill your babies,
but then you can keep your babies at

121
00:04:29,241 --> 00:04:32,530
another document and you can devote like
one essay probaby where they make sense.

122
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,910
That sounds similar to stand up comedy
and a lot of ways like one of the

123
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:41,530
hardest things about comedy isn't
recognizing like I'm a bit,

124
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,830
sometimes it's just too fat,
there's too much stuff in it and you

125
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:47,890
have to figure out what to chop off.
But you have like these emotional

126
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,550
connections to these punchlines like
upon,

127
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,130
I love this part,
I love saying it.

128
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,280
This is like my favorite part,
but that favorite part doesn't

129
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:58,270
necessarily enhance the whole thing.
So you have to kind of chip it away and

130
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:01,150
then the whole thing will be better
without it.

131
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,470
But it's,
it's hard to do.

132
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,430
Right.
Oh God.

133
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,930
I mean,
the best piece I ever,

134
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,200
I've advice I ever got when I started
writing was um,

135
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,870
my friend Laurie,
who's that really cool journalist said

136
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,850
to me,
the worst articles I've ever written are

137
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,130
the ones where I tried to say everything
about a subject.

138
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,970
That makes sense.
Yeah.

139
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,630
Well you,
your,

140
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,300
your style is really interesting too
because one of the things that was

141
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,830
really cool,
it's like you've got a lot of

142
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,310
illustrations that go along with these
stories.

143
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,970
Now are these illustrations that you
added in after the fact or the

144
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:35,170
illustrations that you sort of drew
while you were experiencing these

145
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,330
things?
A few of them I drew at the time.

146
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:40,210
Like there are some old illustrations
like from Turkey or from Paris that I

147
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,670
did when I was teenager.
Some stuff from occupied,

148
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,660
but I'd say like over a hundred of them
I did new for the book.

149
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,480
Oh Wow.
So that's a lot of extra work on top of

150
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:50,920
that as well.
Oh my God.

151
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,170
How many days would you doing this every
day?

152
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:56,620
Or how will you find the time?
Cause I know you're so busy doing

153
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,190
journalism,
you'd be busy doing

154
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,110
art.
Like how'd you find the time to do this?

155
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,480
Um,
I was a really horrible person to be

156
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:05,470
around for quite a few months.
Uh,

157
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,170
I have the coolest boyfriend in the
world.

158
00:06:07,171 --> 00:06:09,840
Thank you fred for putting up with me
during this fred,

159
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,711
Fred.
Fred is,

160
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,590
Fred is awesome.
I,

161
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,250
I had a few things.
First,

162
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:18,750
I had friends with a house in the
country and they let me stay there for a

163
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,850
number of weeks and they didn't have
internet signal and a lot of it.

164
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,250
So I,
I didn't bring any of my fun books that

165
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,690
I liked to read.
So I was just stuck.

166
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:27,000
It was just me in this fucking thing and
we're going to beat each other.

167
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,640
I rented a lot of hotel rooms.
I had an an editor put a beat down on me

168
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,280
and was like,
you can't keep going off to other

169
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,960
countries.
You actually have to write this book

170
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,630
that I contracted you for eye.
And at one point he was like,

171
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:42,630
are you fleeing towards zone?
So you don't have to look at your book

172
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:43,890
contract.
Is that how it's going?

173
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,760
I just,
I think towards the end I didn't do

174
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:54,090
anything but work on it.
I just became this horrible like troll

175
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:57,390
beast that didn't wash her hair and
would growl at anyone who came near

176
00:06:57,391 --> 00:06:59,970
living entirely in coffee and just made
it.

177
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,863
That was how I did it.
Yeah.

178
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,570
That is a good way to do it.
Right?

179
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,010
If you can get somewhere without the
internet.

180
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,830
Yeah.
I used to write a lot on airplanes.

181
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,990
I so look forward to airplane flights.
I'd be like,

182
00:07:08,991 --> 00:07:10,760
okay,
I'm stuck in this seat.

183
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,300
There's no Internet access.
And then what the fuck do the airlines

184
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:14,970
do?
They put it

185
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,130
[inaudible] on the God damn planes.
I know.

186
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,330
And then you're like,
oh,

187
00:07:18,331 --> 00:07:20,160
I need to see what someone says about me
on twitter.

188
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:21,600
Oh no,
someone was wrong on twitter.

189
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:22,530
I must remedy that.

190
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,040
Go on Amazon and buy a new pair of
sneakers,

191
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,510
you know?
Exactly.

192
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,390
It's so easy to just get distracted
nowadays.

193
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:33,380
It's just the world is becoming more and
more available,

194
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,660
you know?
And if you're off in a cabin in the

195
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,940
woods with no Internet access,

196
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,523
yeah.
Your,

197
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,361
your,
your stock.

198
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,350
You're,
you're confronted with your own work to

199
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:42,800
do.

200
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,970
Yeah.
It's so attractive.

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,270
That's such an attractive idea.
It'd be off in a cab.

202
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:48,350
It's so romantic,
right.

203
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,470
To be off in a cabin in the woods by
herself working on your,

204
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,730
your great work.

205
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,580
Except whenever I'm actually there,
I want to like dig holes.

206
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,760
It was in my arms because I'm like,
no,

207
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,190
there is a guy that I tweeted about
today.

208
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,810
Uh,
there was an article that I tweeted

209
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,550
where this guy decided he wanted to live
by himself in the,

210
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:11,070
uh,
I think it was a northwest territory's

211
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,630
who's going to do it for a solid year
and,

212
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,140
but he made it six months and then he
had a satellite phone.

213
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:16,891
It's like,
come get me,

214
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:20,520
I can't fucking do this anymore.
But he was just going crazy like by

215
00:08:20,521 --> 00:08:23,550
himself for six months and it's a,
it's a fascinating story.

216
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,760
This is the guy right here.
Norwegian adventurer spent six months

217
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:29,850
alone in the north territory.
Holderness and uh,

218
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,710
it's really cool because the guy is,
he is very good at describing like what

219
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:38,940
he felt and what it was like and what he
expected versus what it was really like.

220
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,460
One of the things that he said that I
thought was really interesting,

221
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:44,510
he said,
we are not meant to be alone and I kind

222
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:46,620
of feel that way too.
I feel like I,

223
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,260
you know,
people romanticize this idea of being

224
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,850
this hermit.
It's off in the woods,

225
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:51,630
you know,
the,

226
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,120
the,
the monk that's out meditating in the

227
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:56,040
forest by himself,
that shit is

228
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,810
like,
it's like holding your breath.

229
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,330
It's kind of cool for a little while,
but you don't,

230
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:02,100
you don't want to do it very long.

231
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,930
No,
man,

232
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,980
I think,
I mean,

233
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:07,190
it makes you go crazy.
Like being in solitary things makes you

234
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:10,250
go crazy.
I recently did a really big

235
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:13,220
investigative piece.
I'm on some longterm solitary prisoners

236
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,980
and these guys like were really smart
guys.

237
00:09:15,981 --> 00:09:17,930
They were,
you know,

238
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,040
really,
um,

239
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,560
strong guys in my opinion.
Like one of them,

240
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,850
I consider them really a genius,
but he had been in solitary for 14

241
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:26,481
years.
Man.

242
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:29,400
14 years.
And um,

243
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,640
who is this?
His name is Andre Jacobs.

244
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,680
He,
I was part of these group of

245
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:35,750
whistleblowers called the Dallas six
that,

246
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,990
um,
basically they were giving information

247
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:42,860
about guards doing,
I'm beating people up and being racist

248
00:09:42,861 --> 00:09:47,861
in this prison in PA and they're all in
solitary and the guards retaliated.

249
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,000
And then when one of the other guys,
Carrington sued the Dea for,

250
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:56,900
I'm not protecting him from the guards,
the da turned around and charged them

251
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:57,740
all with rioting.

252
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,720
And I got really into the case cause I
was like,

253
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,410
this seems semantically interesting.
How do you ride if you're in solitary?

254
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:06,950
I consider riding at group activity.
Like if someone's riding in solitary,

255
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,550
he could just leave them there and they
get tired eventually and then the right

256
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,490
would be over.
You know,

257
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,580
that's hilarious.
He called it rioting.

258
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,880
So they're at,
so I uh,

259
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,690
I did an investigative piece and
eventually I got like video and stuff

260
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:20,600
but,
and it was bullshit and I really hope

261
00:10:20,601 --> 00:10:23,240
they're trial goes well in February,
but as part of it,

262
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:25,250
you know,
he spent a lot of time talking to um,

263
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,520
two of the guys and I mean you sat for
real mental trauma from doing that and

264
00:10:31,671 --> 00:10:34,190
like no one,
even like the smartest,

265
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,370
toughest,
best person who has like a really loving

266
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,260
mom that is really devoted to giving
them,

267
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,300
you know,
all the books and all the support,

268
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,480
even that person will suffer like real,
real trauma from that.

269
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:47,560
Yeah.
I've always wondered like when Bradley

270
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,460
Manning was arrested and then later
became Chelsea manning and spent how

271
00:10:51,461 --> 00:10:53,500
many years was he?
She,

272
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,470
you know,
whenever the transition makes sense.

273
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,980
Uh,
how many years was she in solitary?

274
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,830
Like cool.
Like it was quite a long time and three

275
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,120
years I think.
Naked.

276
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,840
Yeah.
Naked and in cold conditions,

277
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:12,700
like they literally tortured her,
like take tortured her.

278
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,310
Like they,
what they decided when do you,

279
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,270
when do you say her and when his him,
cause when did she decide to transition?

280
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,540
When she was in there.
Right.

281
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:20,810
Yeah.

282
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,100
See,
like announce the transition,

283
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,140
um,
right after her trial.

284
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,400
But she,
um,

285
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,160
I mean if you look at her chat logs with
Adrian Lamo,

286
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,010
she has one line where she says that
what she's afraid of is being known to

287
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:32,480
the world as a boy.
So I think,

288
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,900
I think she decided herself along a long
time ago,

289
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:37,490
but before she was arrested,
yeah.

290
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:39,980
Before she was arrested,
but that she just didn't publicly

291
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,940
announce it for a long time.
That is a crazy,

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,590
the worst things to be known as a boy.
Yeah.

293
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,610
Whoa.
Yeah.

294
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:47,870
It was a,
it was a line from the chat log.

295
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,280
And anyone who's listening to this,
like,

296
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,080
please fact check it.
I don't want to get it wrong,

297
00:11:51,081 --> 00:11:54,310
but that's what I remember.
But I remember thinking

298
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,950
like,
who wouldn't lose their fucking mind

299
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,670
being naked in a room by herself for
years?

300
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,980
Like what did they,
they thought that she was a,

301
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,720
um,
a hazard to ourself or something.

302
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,010
They're,
they're,

303
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,300
they're bullshit excuses where he's
like,

304
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,730
oh,
you're a suicide risk so we have to have

305
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:12,430
you naked with no glasses,
nothing to read,

306
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,270
a horrible like suicide prevention
blanket that you can't like,

307
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,070
you know,
wrap around you and just,

308
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,920
we have to like torture here cause he
might be a suicide risk.

309
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,430
Like is she in like regular prison now
or still in solitary?

310
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,700
She's in regular prison right now
actually like one of my most cherished

311
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:33,170
possessions in the university.
She wrote me a letter once cause I,

312
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:37,720
I drew a birthday card for her.
She dots her i's with little doves.

313
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,490
It's really cute with doves.
Yeah.

314
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:41,740
She draws little doves on them.
Every I,

315
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,840
yeah.
I hope this isn't a long letter now as a

316
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,190
short one.
Is that it was a gracious one.

317
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:45,641
It wasn't me.
It was,

318
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:46,870
I think it,
it reminded me of like,

319
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:48,340
you know,
the thank you card that like someone

320
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:49,250
very graciously,
right.

321
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,410
Someone who's giving them a gift.

322
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,780
But what a bizarre set of circumstances.
Someone who was a soldier who transition

323
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:57,940
to becoming a woman and then sends
letters at all,

324
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:01,720
have the,
the animal that's known as the symbol of

325
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:02,630
peace.
Yeah.

326
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,940
Over all the eyes.

327
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,990
I mean,
I think from her life you get the sense

328
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:10,510
that part of the reason she wants to
join the army,

329
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:13,270
but she's just like so smart and she
just wanted to go to college.

330
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,440
I mean,
I'm,

331
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,260
from what I know kind of about reading
her life story like this,

332
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,410
this was someone who like her happiest
time was like dating a dude who is

333
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,070
around sort of like the mit hacker
scene.

334
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,140
And I think that if she was middle class
and not poor,

335
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:30,070
she just would have like gone to school
and gotten a computer science degree and

336
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:33,550
that would have been the whole thing.
It's incredible that someone who exposes

337
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,384
crimes

338
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,660
and that's uh,
that's the only way you could look at

339
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:39,360
what happened with Edward Snowden end
with Bradley Manning.

340
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,040
I mean,
you could say that they did,

341
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,340
what they did was treasonous you get
isn't really treasonous when you're

342
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:45,450
exposing crime.
Like,

343
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,820
isn't it supposed to be illegal to
commit crime?

344
00:13:47,821 --> 00:13:50,520
And if your government is doing things
that are illegal,

345
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,120
isn't it your job as a patriot to expose
those things?

346
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,490
Like when do you,
when is it not treasonous?

347
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,321
Oh God,
yeah.

348
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:58,820
I mean they're,
both of them are heroes.

349
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,690
Um,
if no one is putting their own

350
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:06,860
government in check,
then that government will just tend to

351
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:10,550
concentrating more and more power and
people in it will concentrate to doing

352
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:14,330
worse and worse things cause there's no
sort of supervision and there's no way

353
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:15,860
that you can love your country and I'll
call it on.

354
00:14:15,861 --> 00:14:18,260
It's bullshit at all.
I think that the opposite thing is

355
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,330
treason.
I think it's treason to say like,

356
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,970
just because it's my country,
any crime is justified

357
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,190
with a,
what they're doing though is so horrible

358
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:28,700
because they're making it so that no one
ever does anything like this.

359
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,280
Again,
it's so they make such a giant example.

360
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,820
Like Julian assange is literally like
going crazy.

361
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,780
The staying in that one house in,
in London,

362
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:42,500
he can't leave if he leaves the arrest
him the moment he steps foot on that.

363
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,290
Like what a crazy thing.
Like he can get out in the balcony and

364
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:49,130
wave to people and get a slight amount
of vitamin D and then he has to go back

365
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:51,290
inside and he's fucking trapped.

366
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,710
Snowden is hanging out with Putin and
Russia,

367
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,800
which is just bizarre to me.
So strange.

368
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,080
I watched a bizarre Putin video today.
Which food and video did he watch?

369
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,890
Hooten they're analyzing his gait the
way he walks.

370
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,540
So creepy.
Like why don't they just admit that they

371
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,430
like have a crush on him and one have a
sleep over?

372
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,990
That is so weird.
I mean,

373
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,570
well it's because he has a very specific
way of walking that's indicative of

374
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,610
someone who has military training.
It's called the gunslingers gate as I

375
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,930
did.
Did they make that term up themselves?

376
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,220
I guess they probably did,
but what he does is he swings his left

377
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:30,590
arm but not his right,
so he could pull his gun out really

378
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,060
quickly.
That's the idea.

379
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:37,070
But what's really bizarre about the
video is I didn't know how like opulent

380
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,910
wherever he is,
what palace or whatever the fuck it is.

381
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,640
Like they have these fucking ignore it.
Like here it is,

382
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,280
look at these.
He norm is gold doors.

383
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,440
Like let's play it.
Let's play at Jamie.

384
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:51,590
So he could watch this.
Like if you watch as he walks,

385
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,840
if you notice his left arm swings
noticeably while his right arm stays

386
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,470
relatively still in comparison,
like a huge contrast.

387
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,670
And he always does this and that's so
that he could shoot you in the fucking

388
00:16:04,671 --> 00:16:08,960
head quicker.
I think I got someone finds out there's

389
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:12,530
an untreated rotator cuff injury and one
of the that's true,

390
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:14,690
right?
We're just like looking way too into it.

391
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,400
But apparently it's really common
amongst these guys in the Russian

392
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,590
military that,
uh,

393
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,860
get that move to some form of political
power.

394
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,930
But what's kind of creepy?
It's about it.

395
00:16:26,931 --> 00:16:28,370
Backing up to the beginning again,
Jamie,

396
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:29,540
please.
Um,

397
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,900
what's creepy it's about is look at
those fucking doors.

398
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,920
Like what is that like?
What are those God damn doors.

399
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,590
Look at all that gold.
Everything's gold.

400
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,770
I mean,
I guess that's the vestiges of being an

401
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:47,570
imperial power where people used to
collect faberge eggs and he is,

402
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,650
I mean,
he is one of the most open dictators

403
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,840
that you can see in modern society in
which it's supposed to be some sort of a

404
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,980
democracy.
I'm not entirely familiar with how the

405
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:04,700
Russians run their political system,
but I know that he was out and then he

406
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:05,534
was,
you know,

407
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,590
he puts some other guy and some sort of
a puppet position and now he's back

408
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:11,400
running the whole show.
But it's,

409
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,400
it's,
he's a weird case man.

410
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,790
I don't know how he manages it.
It seems like guys like that someone

411
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:19,430
always wants to kill them and just,
it always falls apart.

412
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:22,790
But he's managed to keep it together for
a long,

413
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,530
long,
long time.

414
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,671
Now.
He is,

415
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,510
I mean,
I can't say,

416
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:28,760
I'm like super familiar with Russian
politics,

417
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:31,370
so I could,
I might be talking bullshit,

418
00:17:31,371 --> 00:17:33,470
but I mean,
he,

419
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,300
you know,
he was the ex head of the KGB.

420
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:40,280
Like he seems incredibly versed and
spying on people and killing people who

421
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,280
are threats and maintaining his position
at all costs.

422
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,420
Yeah.
He doesn't just kill him.

423
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:46,130
He kills him like openly.
Yeah.

424
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,070
Hasn't gotten down in front of their
girlfriends and stuff like that.

425
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,080
He's just,
it's just it massive terror tactic.

426
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,940
Who was that one guy that was,
yeah,

427
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:58,740
he was walking with his girlfriend and
his thought was that he had become so

428
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:02,370
famous from criticizing and the Putin
couldn't kill him because if he did it

429
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:04,080
would be so obvious.
Nope.

430
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,490
No,
he doesn't care.

431
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,270
I mean,
I always think about,

432
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,850
um,
there is a very respected,

433
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:11,220
a journalist whose name,
last name I won't pronounce cause I'll,

434
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:12,054
I'll butcher it.

435
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,740
But um,
yeah,

436
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:16,200
she was also just like gunned down for
criticizing him.

437
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,620
Yeah.
Well that's kind of happened sort or

438
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,980
fear for theoretically at least in other
places.

439
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:27,050
But one on one of the weird ones in
America was that Michael Hastings Guy,

440
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,500
that guy.
That's a,

441
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,440
that's still,
that one really freaks me out to this

442
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,330
day.
Cause if you don't know the story,

443
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,870
Michael Hastings was,
there's actually a ted talk,

444
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,890
um,
that's available right now.

445
00:18:38,891 --> 00:18:42,120
It's,
I'm a podcast called the Ted Radio Hour,

446
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,490
which I listened to all the time that
had,

447
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,430
um,
one episode called disruptive

448
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:50,070
leadership,
but it actually focused on this general

449
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:53,700
general mcallister.
And they were kind of sympathetic to him

450
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,700
in this,
in this Ted talk because,

451
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,310
uh,
the idea was that he did a real

452
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:01,280
leadership thing by stepping down and
what,

453
00:19:01,281 --> 00:19:06,281
what it was was Michael Hastings had
gotten embedded in this military

454
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,370
organization,
whether they were overseas and when the

455
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,070
volcano erupted,
remember that volcano in Iceland,

456
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,090
it erupted and it's fucked up all the
flights out of Europe and a,

457
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:23,880
you couldn't fly from that part of the
world to this part of the world.

458
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,081
So,
uh,

459
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,480
he got stuck.
It was supposed to be a short trip and

460
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:31,590
he got stuck over there for a month.
And as he got closer and closer to these

461
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:33,480
people,
they've got more and more relaxed and

462
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:37,540
they started telling jokes that were
inappropriate about like Al Gore and,

463
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,630
or Joseph Biden.
And,

464
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:43,020
um,
along the lines of this,

465
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,950
this Guy Michael Hastings formulated
this article,

466
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,600
published it in rolling stone and um,
it became this sort of a national

467
00:19:51,601 --> 00:19:55,610
scandal and I believe his name is Miguel
Esta right?

468
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,300
Is that his name?
He,

469
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,850
um,
he was forced to step down and that's

470
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:03,480
what the whole focus of this ted radio
hour was about was this guy,

471
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,790
um,
taking a leadership position,

472
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,910
a leadership point of view by deciding
that his position was not as important

473
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:13,380
as the cause itself.
And he was just going to step down

474
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:18,381
because he had created this environment
where it was too much controversy and he

475
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:19,890
was upset that,
um,

476
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,790
President Obama didn't ask him to stay,
but it is what it is and that's it.

477
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,750
But what they don't say in this thing
was just Michael Hastings guy who was in

478
00:20:27,751 --> 00:20:30,390
this recording,
who's talking about what it was like

479
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:35,391
when he was there and he committed
suicide in one of the strangest,

480
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:39,090
most controversial ways ever.
I don't think it was a suicide.

481
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,010
I think it was an accident.
Well,

482
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,790
some people think it was a suicide.
Some people think it was an accident and

483
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,010
that the black helicopter crew thinks
that he

484
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,940
was murdered and that what they did is
they took over the electronics in his

485
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:56,230
Mercedes and they forced his car to
drive right into a tree at 120 miles an

486
00:20:56,231 --> 00:21:00,830
hour with no brakes and explode.
And let me,

487
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,390
there's all this crazy,
all these crazy conspiracy theories that

488
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:09,240
are attached to it that say that engines
don't go flying from a car like that

489
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,190
unless there's a bomb involved.
And you know,

490
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,810
like,
why would this guy do this?

491
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,480
And it is pretty,
pretty trippy stuff.

492
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,100
And then there was claims that there was
crystal meth in his system and then he

493
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:21,581
was,
you know,

494
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:24,760
high on drugs and he had a problem with
drugs in the past.

495
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,680
But then the counter to that was people
were like,

496
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:27,131
well,
no,

497
00:21:27,131 --> 00:21:29,470
he's probably doing adderall,
which a lot of writers do.

498
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,420
Yeah,
right.

499
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,490
Yeah.
It's like the New York drug.

500
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,840
Everyone's on adderall in New York,
is it?

501
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

502
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,640
I mean,
I,

503
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,740
I know a lot of people who were very
close to,

504
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,190
to Michael Hastings and,
um,

505
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,320
I will say that people that I know that
are very close to him think it was a

506
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:44,160
tragic accident.

507
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,090
They just happened to be going 120 miles
an hour on sunset boulevard.

508
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,411
Yeah.
I mean that's,

509
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:51,130
that's,
that's for the people I know that,

510
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,660
you know,
he never hit his brakes.

511
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,370
I,
I can't,

512
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,630
I can't debate it.
But that's,

513
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,450
that's just what I've heard from people,
from people who I'm very close to who

514
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,040
are close to him.
I would say that too,

515
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,470
if I was close to that dude,
I knew I was on some sort of a list.

516
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,900
If you're close to that guy,
you know,

517
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:06,860
you gotta be on a list.

518
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,661
Oh my God.
Well,

519
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,990
I mean probably like if you're an
investigative journalist doing a lot of

520
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:13,360
stuff in Iraq and Somalia,
you're probably on the list.

521
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,550
You're talking about yourself.
Uh,

522
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,090
I haven't done Somalia stuff.
Um,

523
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,051
no,
I mean,

524
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:18,940
but like a lot of his friends were
investigative journalists.

525
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,670
Yeah,
I'm sure everybody's,

526
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,820
I'm a,
I'm probably on the list,

527
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,470
probably analyst for having you right
here.

528
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,210
Dude.
I know you dude.

529
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,330
I'm in California.
I don't know.

530
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,520
I'm,
I'm adopting adopting the a in the

531
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,280
native dialect.
I,

532
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm sure we're all on lists because how
could you be interesting if you're not

533
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:36,730
on the list?
That's true.

534
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,820
It's sort of like a badge of courage to
be on some sort of a list.

535
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,680
Depends on what lists though,
you know.

536
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,690
But uh,
yeah,

537
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:46,750
it's a weird world we live in right now.
I think it's a,

538
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,590
it's,
there's a temporary bridge right now.

539
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:52,090
Let's go on,
on where,

540
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,250
where there,
it's the NSA,

541
00:22:54,251 --> 00:22:56,710
you know,
fill in the blank with whatever name of

542
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:58,990
whatever organization that's supposedly
watching over us.

543
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,860
But they have a certain amount of power
to look into people that we don't have

544
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:06,760
yet that's temporary.
It is going to come a time where this

545
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,300
electronic barrier that we have in
between each other,

546
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:13,270
it's all going to dissolve and
everyone's going to have the same sort

547
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:16,030
of power to spy on everybody at the NSA
has.

548
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,560
And we're just going to have to accept
it.

549
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:19,960
It's going to be very straight.
It's going to be like we're all camping.

550
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:20,820
Oh okay.

551
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,560
God's going to horrifying worlds.
We already know too much about each

552
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,180
other.
We

553
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,050
do.
Right.

554
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,290
Was that a concern when you were writing
this book cause you empty yourself out

555
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:34,470
in this book.
I mean you talk about sexual liaisons

556
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:36,900
and you know,
relationships and friendships and things

557
00:23:36,901 --> 00:23:39,090
gone wrong and was,
did you,

558
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,550
when you were writing this,
did you ever say,

559
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:44,190
man,
I mean maybe I don't want everybody

560
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,890
didn't know these things.

561
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,850
I had a few things that were like that
usually with actually with friendships,

562
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,800
but ultimately I thought that it was
more important to be honest though,

563
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:59,360
the one thing that I did do was I felt
like it would have been really unfair if

564
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:01,490
I had taken kind of,
you know,

565
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,750
personal moments I had with someone like
15 years ago and just like put them in a

566
00:24:05,751 --> 00:24:08,930
book and that's on that person's google
result without asking them.

567
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:13,010
So while I tried to be pretty merciless
with myself,

568
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,890
with people who I'm still friends with,
I got their approval on what I wrote

569
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:16,760
about them.
Oh,

570
00:24:16,761 --> 00:24:18,400
that's really cool.
That's it.

571
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:19,300
That's really important.
That's it.

572
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,080
That would be a real good way to destroy
a friendship who started telling crazy,

573
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,510
intimate stories about someone just not
cool.

574
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:27,530
Like it's not,
it's not fair.

575
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,730
You know?
So,

576
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:31,100
and I know that light,
a lot of people disagree with that and

577
00:24:31,101 --> 00:24:32,390
they're like,
they're my memories.

578
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,370
But I don't know.
I don't think it's right.

579
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:35,990
Especially if you're kind of the more
famous one.

580
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,430
It not cool.
Yeah,

581
00:24:37,431 --> 00:24:39,200
we'll sing there.
My memories.

582
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,720
But if you share a moment with someone,
I think it's kind of a group memory or

583
00:24:44,721 --> 00:24:46,910
at least a group moment.
Yeah.

584
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:48,620
It's kind of kind of collectively owned.
And I,

585
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:52,070
I ran them by my parents also.
Dad's gotta be weird.

586
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,310
That was the most terrifying thing.
And there is the,

587
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,610
cause I ran the parts about my parents
buy them,

588
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,560
but then they hadn't read the whole
book.

589
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:04,730
And I had this really terrifying thing
when the book came out where I was like,

590
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,290
oh my God,
what are they going to think?

591
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,780
I mean,
I love my parents.

592
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:11,840
I have really supportive relationship.
I couldn't ask for like two cooler

593
00:25:11,841 --> 00:25:15,260
people on Earth unit knew my parents.
But still you're always scared,

594
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:15,440
right?

595
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,170
It's,
it's scary to show yourself like that

596
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,220
but,
but they liked it.

597
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,770
They liked it mostly.
So I'm very happy about that.

598
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,890
While you must have really open minded
parents.

599
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,200
My Mama,
she used to be an illustrator and now

600
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:29,810
she's mostly retired.
She works kind of as a babysitter slash

601
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:33,470
cats that are now and um,
my dad and my dad's an academic.

602
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,760
Oh that's cool.
Well,

603
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:37,610
so yeah,
you seem obviously have some intelligent

604
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,040
open minded parents so they've got to be
really proud of you cause this is

605
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:41,810
excellent stuff.
Thank you so much.

606
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:42,890
Yeah,
they really are.

607
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:46,340
And um,
it was cool because I got to talk about

608
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:49,040
how both of them influenced me so much
in there.

609
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,600
Totally,
totally different ways.

610
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,000
Like my mom is an amazing artist.
She,

611
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:56,660
she trusts so beautifully and she draws
kind of like me.

612
00:25:56,661 --> 00:26:00,130
If I was a less bitter and jagged person
like,

613
00:26:00,131 --> 00:26:04,370
like she drives like the sweet me and I
was able to say like,

614
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:06,170
this is how my mom taught me how to
draw.

615
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,610
You know,
this is how she inspired me.

616
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,640
You've got some great people that are
reviewed this too,

617
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,800
man.
You got Matt Taibbi to review this.

618
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:17,150
Patton Oswald reviewed this.
I mean this is really fucking impressive

619
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:18,260
stuff.
Thank you.

620
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,580
And that,
that's awesome.

621
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:24,581
He actually interviewed me for my book
launch in New York and I grew up reading

622
00:26:25,011 --> 00:26:25,401
that,
you know,

623
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:28,390
I was reading like the exile when I was
18 and I,

624
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,170
I love his stuff in New York press.
And what I love about Matt's work is

625
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:36,590
that a lot of journalists like,
they're like these really like narrow

626
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,390
professional people that are very,
very serious.

627
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:43,100
And Matt was like this total wild man
and he was yelling and now he does this

628
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,650
incredible investigative journalism on
finance and politics,

629
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:49,560
but he still writes like a real person.
He still writes and that kind of hunter

630
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:51,450
s Thompson tone.
That's exactly,

631
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,270
I was going to describe it like a lucid
hunters Thompson.

632
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,010
Exactly.
Like this drug addled

633
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,591
yeah,
yeah.

634
00:26:57,591 --> 00:27:01,160
Best of hunter s Thompson and less
narcissistic bit and we know much less

635
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,860
narcissistic now,
but it was so influential on me cause I

636
00:27:03,861 --> 00:27:04,880
was like,
wow,

637
00:27:04,881 --> 00:27:09,290
you can totally be this bad ass
investigative journalist and you could

638
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:13,700
also be this guy who when he was young
was having these crazies often criminal

639
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:17,840
adventures in like the aftermath of the
Soviet Union falling.

640
00:27:17,841 --> 00:27:20,300
Those two things weren't nodding
compatible at all.

641
00:27:20,301 --> 00:27:21,890
I,
I always liked people like that who have

642
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,300
lives that are really,
really diverse.

643
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,220
Yeah,
that's a really good way of describing

644
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:29,610
him too because we do have this idea
that if you're going to be an

645
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:33,680
investigative journalist that your piece
has to be sort of homogenized and that

646
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,040
is going to the,
the facts take precedent over the flavor

647
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,790
of the pros and his has a lot of flavor.
There's a lot of,

648
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,820
there's a lot of personality in
distributing those facts,

649
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:46,710
but it doesn't get in the way of the
facts.

650
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,611
Oh God,
no,

651
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:48,444
no,
he's,

652
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,120
it's,
it's such like a master class on how to

653
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:53,940
do it.
And in fact it's really serves the

654
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:55,440
facts.
Cause especially when he's writing about

655
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,290
financial journalism,
I mean,

656
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,840
finance can be so boring and so
complicated that it can really be over

657
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:03,660
most people's heads.
And if you write it completely without

658
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:05,670
flavor,
most people will never even be able to

659
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,170
sink into it at all.
Yeah.

660
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:07,620
Is

661
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,250
Guy that I got most of my information
about the financial collapse about,

662
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:16,030
and one of the things that disturbed me
the most was how little reaction like

663
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:20,850
publicly his articles caused.
Like I thought like it would be one of

664
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:23,160
those things where everyone would be
sharing it.

665
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:25,590
It would go,
it would be on the front page of the New

666
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:30,020
York Times today on CNN,
Matt Taibbi uncover.

667
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,380
And everybody would be like,
Ooh,

668
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,300
look at the facts.
This is crazy.

669
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:38,540
But meanwhile it was like this terrible,
terrible scenario where the whole system

670
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:45,720
was hijacked by these fucking criminals
and no one seemed to care.

671
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,170
It just w I have bills to pay,
I have to keep going.

672
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,130
I have a spin class at nine o'clock I
can't be paying and no one,

673
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,370
no one really gave it the attention or I
shouldn't say no one but not publicly

674
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:01,350
nationally.
It didn't get nearly the attention that

675
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:04,410
it deserves and he wrote a series of
them and you know,

676
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,870
some of them I was like,
this guy's going to get fucking killed.

677
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,170
Like these were,
these were intense allegations and it's

678
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,340
it and backed up.
All of it backed up by facts and really

679
00:29:14,341 --> 00:29:17,460
well written and it's just like almost
like it's too much for people.

680
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,703
This is like,

681
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,150
it's like complicated.
It deals with a lot of things that are

682
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,510
kind of boring,
very intellectually demanding,

683
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:29,250
not necessarily partisan.
And I think for a lot of people are

684
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,640
like,
what are you going to do?

685
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,720
Yeah,
it bothers me that he's not more famous.

686
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,673
That bothers me.

687
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,230
I think.
I hope with the next book he will be,

688
00:29:38,231 --> 00:29:40,730
cause I think he's like one of the best
journalists working in American.

689
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,053
Yeah,
I agree.

690
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,811
I agree.
He's,

691
00:29:42,811 --> 00:29:44,730
he's amazing.
He's amazing.

692
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,090
Now you,
how much time do you spend doing all

693
00:29:48,091 --> 00:29:48,930
this?
You too.

694
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:51,330
A lot of journalism and you do a lot of
crazy shit.

695
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,480
You go to a really nutty sort of
dangerous places.

696
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,590
I've been to a few.
Yeah.

697
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,620
What is like the most disturbing place
that you've been to?

698
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:03,000
Dangerous place I went to was last
summer when I went into Syria for a day.

699
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,490
And that was,
um,

700
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,450
basically the reason why when I talk
about how dangerous it was,

701
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,950
the fact that I wouldn't even spend the
night there shows probably something

702
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:17,280
about my tolerance levels.
But at that time,

703
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,940
this coalition of Islamist groups had
just kicked isis out of this border town

704
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:27,990
called is Oz.
And you could take a bus over to the

705
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:32,700
Turkish border and then you could cross.
And I did that with a war journalist

706
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:35,820
friend of mine and I spent a day with
the Islamic Front driving around his

707
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:39,390
eyes.
And one of the things,

708
00:30:39,391 --> 00:30:41,340
um,
that was happening then was it was

709
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:41,880
before,
uh,

710
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,020
James Foley was murdered,
but we all knew that there were lots and

711
00:30:46,021 --> 00:30:48,420
lots of kidnappings there.
And at that point we thought it was just

712
00:30:48,421 --> 00:30:49,890
for ransom and stuff,
but still,

713
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,540
you know,
it's Kinda brings a terrible,

714
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,200
terrible thing.

715
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,690
And when,
um,

716
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,390
the scariest thing that ever happened to
me as a journalist was we're with these

717
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:00,090
three,
a young media activist slash fighter

718
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,920
guys,
really cool dudes.

719
00:31:01,921 --> 00:31:04,530
I mean,
I liked them and we're in this car,

720
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:08,250
we're driving around his eyes and the
car slows to a halt.

721
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,690
It just breaks down.
And Patrick,

722
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:15,810
the guy I'm with and immediately thinks
it's set up for kidnapping to,

723
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,733
you know,
get,

724
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,240
get us out of the car because that's one
way that you can set things up for

725
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:25,920
kidnappings.
And the guys didn't have their guns.

726
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,060
And so we had to walk to the media
office,

727
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,860
um,
through his eyes and his eyes at that

728
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:33,690
point looked like something out of Mad
Max.

729
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,520
Like it was just no women on the street,
just men.

730
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,290
A lot of Ak is,
uh,

731
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,930
even if a guy didn't have any k like
they'd be holding like sticks and stuff.

732
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:40,800
Um,
they are,

733
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:44,160
were,
well there was a like what I can only

734
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:47,730
describe as like a gun bodega,
which is fascinating because it's sold

735
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,880
all these different guns.
Like it might sound like a beautiful

736
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,930
antique,
you know,

737
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:54,630
Pearl in laid revolver that like
someone's dad had,

738
00:31:54,631 --> 00:31:57,030
but then also grenades and stuff and
grenades.

739
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,293
Grenades.
Yeah.

740
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,600
Because you know,
in case someone tried to kidnap you,

741
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:03,510
you could have it grab a fucking,
you come with me bitch.

742
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,380
Yeah.
Basically.

743
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,251
Basically.
Yeah.

744
00:32:05,251 --> 00:32:06,450
So,
you know,

745
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:11,140
we're walking through this town and um,
that was I'd think the scariest thing

746
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,830
that I ever did in my life.
But it all turned out fine.

747
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:18,420
And we got to the media office,
which it was a government building that

748
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,270
they,
that these young men had taken over when

749
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:24,900
they kicked out the central government.
And I'm the director of it had been

750
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,390
kidnapped by Isis and the young guys are
there like watching,

751
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,420
watching soccer cause everyone,
everyone loves soccer there.

752
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,370
And it was just,
I don't know,

753
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:40,250
it's like
this feeling of being in place where,

754
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,113
um,

755
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:46,510
the whole world is both fucking with it
and abandoned it both at once,

756
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:47,950
you know,
and,

757
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,500
um,
and anything could happen.

758
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,030
So that was the most dangerous thing
I've ever done.

759
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:54,760
Like nothing I've ever done was as
dangerous is going to Syria.

760
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,240
But I think the most dot personally
disturbing thing was,

761
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,660
um,
I was in a Gaza six months ago,

762
00:33:01,661 --> 00:33:04,270
I guess.
And I went to shy IA,

763
00:33:04,271 --> 00:33:08,110
which is this neighborhood that was
completely destroyed by Israel during

764
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,210
protective edge.
Like they bombed it and then they went

765
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,100
in with tanks and then they went in with
bulldozers.

766
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,400
Like,
so it's like flattened and it's just

767
00:33:15,401 --> 00:33:16,780
like gone.
Like,

768
00:33:16,781 --> 00:33:17,231
you know,
you,

769
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:18,400
you,
you go there and you're like,

770
00:33:18,401 --> 00:33:20,590
this is,
this is a neighborhood that has been

771
00:33:20,591 --> 00:33:23,350
wrecked.
And a lot of times when you see houses

772
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:26,860
that have collapsed,
you can see all of the stuff of people's

773
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:27,880
lives and it like,
you're like,

774
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,880
oh,
there's the cooking pots and there's the

775
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:33,400
bed and there's all the stuff that's
just trapped in.

776
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,970
And then people,
because there's a big housing shortage

777
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:40,660
obviously in Gaza,
we're living in these bombed out

778
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:41,620
buildings,
you know,

779
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:44,690
where their home was.
And um,

780
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,000
you know,
with like no real like services or

781
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:50,140
anything.
Like I saw this,

782
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,050
I was walking,
it was kind of scrambling through this

783
00:33:53,051 --> 00:33:57,540
like building take pictures and then I
just randomly walked into what I thought

784
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,260
was an abandoned room and there's like
an old guy there,

785
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,530
you know,
hanging out and you know,

786
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,130
I was like,
I'm really sorry to do,

787
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:02,531
you know,
invade,

788
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:05,770
invade your home.
And I was just just talking to him.

789
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:07,170
But yeah,
he had had like a,

790
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:12,171
a baller gorgeous home before this and
now he was just living in a little like

791
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:13,840
the rack of one of the rooms.

792
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,570
Wow.
Wow.

793
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,160
It's,
you know,

794
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:21,010
the Mad Max is the way you described
that,

795
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,690
that city and that sort of apocalyptic
scenario,

796
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,690
something that we all worry could happen
to us,

797
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,870
to anything.
But one of the things that I always try

798
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,490
to remember is that the apocalypse is
already here.

799
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,800
It's just not here.
Yeah.

800
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,840
If you go there,
it's there.

801
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,850
Like in Gaza,
it's there,

802
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,560
that's the apocalypse.
It's there.

803
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:46,780
I mean it might as well be in that guy's
house.

804
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,570
I mean you are living like Mad Max,
those people in that,

805
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,490
what's the name of the city yet?
I saw as,

806
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,880
as,
as and as Oz mean daddy is what

807
00:34:54,881 --> 00:34:57,400
everyone's terrified of.
What everyone's terrified of is a

808
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:01,240
reality where you walked on the street
and everyone's carrying military weapons

809
00:35:01,241 --> 00:35:04,210
and you're just,
it's chaos and there's,

810
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:05,650
it's fairly lawless.

811
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,200
Yeah.
I mean a lot of the refugee camps that I

812
00:35:10,201 --> 00:35:11,640
saw it,
it's not that they were lawless.

813
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:16,070
I would never describe them as that,
but just in the sense of the extreme of

814
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,080
falling in your life situation.
There is a guy I met when I was in Iraqi

815
00:35:21,181 --> 00:35:22,750
Kurdistan.
Uh,

816
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:25,550
last time I was with Dr Borders there
and he,

817
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,870
you know,
he was this like super smart dude.

818
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:30,270
Like he was Kurdish,
which meant that he was really

819
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:32,970
discriminated against,
but he scored so high on his math exams.

820
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:36,090
He was able to go to like an elite
engineering school and get an

821
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:37,270
aeronautics degree.
And know be,

822
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,660
he's never not extend engineer.
And like,

823
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,430
this is a dude that would,
you know,

824
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,980
be beyond the path to like having an
awesome job.

825
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,220
And now like he's living in a tent with
his whole family and his mom and

826
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:50,100
everything.
And you know,

827
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:53,280
you'd never expect that when you're
living in like an awesome city like

828
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,990
Aleppo that he was living in.
And then you're,

829
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,110
and then the war comes and there's
bombings and here you're driven out of

830
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:03,600
your home and you're so displaced that
eventually you're forced to,

831
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:06,690
you know,
be living in this tent with no end in

832
00:36:06,691 --> 00:36:09,810
sight and you're not allowed to like
ever improve your circumstances because

833
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:12,210
you have the wrong passport.
Jesus Christ.

834
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,530
It's hard for anybody living in America
to wrap their head around what it would

835
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:19,800
be like to be there and be stuck in that
position.

836
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,090
It really is.
I mean,

837
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,210
so the Syrian refugee,
mm.

838
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,790
Um,
the Syrian refugee thing,

839
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:31,710
one thing that I,
I think perhaps isn't in the media

840
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,960
enough is that the people who are coming
to Europe right now,

841
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:37,950
or the middle class of the country,
because it's cost over a thousand

842
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,890
dollars to pay it,
to pay that pass smuggler to take you

843
00:36:40,891 --> 00:36:43,680
over.
And every single one of those people

844
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:48,681
could buy a plane ticket and travel like
a normal person and not have their kids

845
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:52,110
risk drowning and all of that.
But they're banned from it cause they're

846
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:55,140
Syrians.
And the whole like taking the boat and

847
00:36:55,141 --> 00:36:59,370
walking from Greece to Germany and
having volunteers give out water and

848
00:36:59,371 --> 00:37:02,250
sleeping on the streets and like the
whole humanitarian disaster is just a

849
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:04,050
function of not letting them buy plane
tickets.

850
00:37:04,051 --> 00:37:05,100
That all,
that's all it is.

851
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,590
Well,
there's this big push in America now,

852
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:12,060
especially among the Republicans not
allow anyone from Syria to come into the

853
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:12,900
United States.

854
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,960
It's crazy.
Like not a single person with the Syrian

855
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:17,330
refugee program has ever been arrested
for terrorism offense.

856
00:37:17,331 --> 00:37:18,350
It's,
it's like it's nuts.

857
00:37:18,351 --> 00:37:21,130
It's,
it's solar brown,

858
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,630
but they're so scary.
They're terrorist.

859
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,870
Oh my God.
It's like one of them that's an asshole.

860
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,640
I'm sure.
I'm sure there's assholes,

861
00:37:28,641 --> 00:37:30,420
but not one of them was arrested for
terrorism offenses.

862
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,380
If you look like a million Canadians and
you're going to,

863
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,790
and they're the nicest people ever,

864
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,530
there'd be like some of those guys that
are in that,

865
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,620
that big like ride was in Toronto.
It's washing cars.

866
00:37:39,621 --> 00:37:41,390
Yeah.
One of the ones the size asking a car

867
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,120
or one of them from the Vancouver.
A hockey riot.

868
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,160
Yeah.
Those assholes would make it through.

869
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,041
No,
it's,

870
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,630
it's crazy.
And it's,

871
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:51,330
um,
it's really like personally upsetting to

872
00:37:51,331 --> 00:37:53,130
me because I've done so much,
you know,

873
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:57,900
work with Syrians over the last few
years and like to see these like amazing

874
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:02,901
people that I know who are so tough and
so smart and have endured so much.

875
00:38:03,691 --> 00:38:04,950
Like being defamed like this,
it's,

876
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,260
I feel almost like someone's shit
talking like my,

877
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,071
like my,
well,

878
00:38:08,071 --> 00:38:09,540
someone that's shit talking my friends,
you know,

879
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:11,250
it,
it makes me angry on,

880
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:12,210
um,
a personal level,

881
00:38:12,211 --> 00:38:13,410
like not just a theoretical one.

882
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,371
Well,
it's not just,

883
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:16,620
it's,
it's so short sighted because if you

884
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:20,250
consider the fact that you're,
you're talking about an entire group of

885
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:23,640
people that's fleeing a terrible area.
Exactly what you're saying.

886
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,020
Well,
they have all got to be bad.

887
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,210
That that's one of the most racist
things that you could ever say publicly

888
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:35,340
in 2015 it gets sort of this weird
excepted racism.

889
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,570
And because of the fact that terrorism,
it,

890
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,570
like when you're dealing with Muslims,
right?

891
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,540
You're dealing with 1.6 is that what it
is?

892
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,760
Billion people,
like a fifth of the world.

893
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,310
And so the idea is saying,
well,

894
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:51,790
lead terrorist activities been,
they have been done by Muslims.

895
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,550
Why don't we kick all the white people
out of America?

896
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,310
Because white people have been
responsible for all the mass shootings.

897
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,550
I mean,
that's more logical than this.

898
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,300
It's so awful.
And like the other thing that's to me

899
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:09,040
like particularly like Moronic is I see
some times in the media like,

900
00:39:09,041 --> 00:39:11,110
why aren't the Muslims condemning the
terrorists?

901
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,900
Every single group that is actually on
the ground,

902
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,820
like fighting isis with guns.
You know,

903
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,260
they're Muslims.
Yeah,

904
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,780
yeah.
They're like 90% Muslim or 95% Muslim.

905
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,180
I mean a lot of them are war criminals
too.

906
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:23,980
I'm not saying they're good groups
necessarily,

907
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:25,300
but they're Muslim.
Um,

908
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,060
every single,
like major Muslim religious leader in

909
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:32,620
the world has condemned isis in terms
that they wouldn't even use an America.

910
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,570
I mean,
it's astounding to me.

911
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,780
I think that the only reason anyone
would think that Muslims are and

912
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:40,420
condemning isis is because they can't
use google.

913
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,510
Don't read the news and have never
spoken to a Muslim or for the same

914
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:47,140
reason why Matt Taibbi abies articles
never really got as popular as I thought

915
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:50,380
they should.
People just don't have the time or the

916
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:52,120
need.
Everything is wonderful.

917
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,160
You go to the supermarket,
you buy food,

918
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:55,000
it's really easy.

919
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,100
You know,
go through the Mcdonald's,

920
00:39:57,101 --> 00:40:00,490
drive through your stomach's full.
You sit home and watch netflix.

921
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:02,920
You're good.
Like you don't need to pay attention to

922
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:04,000
Syria.
Fuck those people.

923
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,440
Keep them out.
Donald Trump's going to keep us safe and

924
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,840
you got to drink yourself into a coma.
Wake up in the morning,

925
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,000
do it all over again.
Drink some coffee,

926
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,950
get out the door,
get your fucking car,

927
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,440
do the same shit.
As long as you can get to work.

928
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,660
I got bills.
As long as you can get to work,

929
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:23,350
you're fine.
It's just the idea of America in the

930
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:27,250
first place was supposed to be a place
where people could go or they didn't

931
00:40:27,251 --> 00:40:29,290
like where they were and they wanted a
found,

932
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:32,700
they wanted to establish a new life.
They want it to,

933
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,220
we're going to take a giant chance.
We're going to get an a fucking stupid

934
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:39,220
boat and make it across this giant body
of water.

935
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,980
We don't even know what it looks like.
They didn't have photos back then.

936
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,070
That's one of the weirdest things about
traveling to America.

937
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:49,690
If you really stop and think about it,
it was done when people didn't even have

938
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:52,330
photographs.
The first people that came over,

939
00:40:52,331 --> 00:40:55,840
if you wanted a picture of something,
you had to fucking draw it right.

940
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:57,890
And that's how crazy these people where
they're like,

941
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,220
I don't care.
I saw drawing.

942
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:02,860
It's a pretty trees.
We're fucking getting in the boat.

943
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,010
But they brought their babies and the
grandma and shit and they got in a boat

944
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:10,150
and they came to America because they
had an idea and then idea was there is a

945
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:14,860
better life here we can,
we can make it and the to deny that to

946
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:18,100
these people because they were born in
the wrong patch of dirt.

947
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,160
And I'm not saying they shouldn't be
checked.

948
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,520
You shouldn't go through a criminal
background check and make sure you're

949
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:28,660
not letting in some mass murderer or not
letting in some rapist or some thieves

950
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:29,830
or whatever.
Yeah.

951
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,740
I mean if there's a way to do that,
that should be done.

952
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,470
But the idea that you should never let
anybody in that's from Syria.

953
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,410
It's like God man,
imagine you're cursed.

954
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,870
You just cause you were born in the the
shitty patch of dirt.

955
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:42,741
That's it.
Yeah,

956
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,440
that's exactly what the thinking is.
It's like because you were born here

957
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:48,050
like oh you carry some virus,
you have to be quarantined.

958
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:49,750
Didn't man.
I'm like,

959
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,830
I'm so,
I'm so fucking grateful that you're

960
00:41:51,831 --> 00:41:52,640
saying this is like,
Gee,

961
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,560
your audience and with like on the
massive platform you have.

962
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:56,120
Like I,
I know it sounds sappy and shit,

963
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:56,750
but like,
thank you.

964
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,410
I really,
yeah.

965
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:59,420
Well listen,
thank you for going over there.

966
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,880
If it wasn't for people like you and,
and you know the,

967
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,330
the vice people and all these
journalists and all these people that go

968
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:08,240
over there and show us in,
in video form,

969
00:42:08,241 --> 00:42:11,150
like exactly what's happening.
And you get to watch it and see what

970
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:12,410
it's like.
They go,

971
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:14,420
oh,
this is fucking chaos.

972
00:42:14,421 --> 00:42:19,070
Like this is in the world right now.
2015 while people were watching the

973
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:21,620
emmy's and everybody's on the red carpet
smiling.

974
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:26,570
There's parts of the world that are like
a Mad Max movie right now.

975
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,660
Or like this refugee camp.
Um,

976
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,053
I went to,
er,

977
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:33,000
it was a bunch of refugee camps in the
Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.

978
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:35,370
Like,
people don't know it gets cold.

979
00:42:35,371 --> 00:42:37,110
They're like kids freeze to death.
You know,

980
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:42,111
every winter I'm in those camps cause
it's like you're living under vinyl tarp

981
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,650
in the mountains.

982
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,420
Jesus Christ.
It's,

983
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:54,090
it's very strange that the world is so
uneven that there are places like the

984
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:59,851
Congo that are like,
that exist on the same timeline as park

985
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:02,080
avenue,
that there's,

986
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:05,470
there's people that have door men that
dress up like the guys that were holding

987
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:09,640
open the door for Putin,
hop into Uber,

988
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:12,160
limousines,
and you travel around the city,

989
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,590
you know,
with the right fragrances and the in the

990
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:15,950
car.
And it's,

991
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,580
it's,
we will live in really strange times

992
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,990
because I think the disparity that
existed that that's kind of always

993
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,550
existed.
There's always been disparity.

994
00:43:24,551 --> 00:43:25,760
There's always been,
you know,

995
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,990
the haves and the have nots.
And in some places it's on a much more

996
00:43:28,991 --> 00:43:33,400
grand scale,
but it's never been so obvious,

997
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,850
especially cause

998
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,460
so many people are online now.
Like I think a lot of people maybe don't

999
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:41,810
realize that.

1000
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:43,060
Okay.

1001
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:46,060
Especially in the Middle East,
like how Internet connected people are.

1002
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,180
When I was in dummies,
which is this a refuge,

1003
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,550
it was the refugee camp in Iraq that I,
that I was at.

1004
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,840
One of the most popular stories was the
store that was selling personal wifi

1005
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,330
hotspots.
And you'd have people that were living

1006
00:43:58,331 --> 00:43:59,560
in like a tent,
you know,

1007
00:43:59,561 --> 00:44:03,190
with tarp and like nothing,
but they'd have like a wifi hotspot and

1008
00:44:03,191 --> 00:44:05,740
that's because they had a family that
was scattered all around the world.

1009
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:09,520
And the only way to communicate them
with them was with whatsapp or with

1010
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,290
texting services like this or with
skype.

1011
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,260
And so like the most important thing you
were going to get was Internet access so

1012
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:17,230
that you could like talk to your brother
that was in one country and your

1013
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:19,810
daughter that was in another like that
was more important than anything

1014
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,540
you said,
daughter,

1015
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,433
I'd heard your using.

1016
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,170
Oh fuck.
It's coming out man.

1017
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:25,940
I tried so hard.
I did it.

1018
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,410
Yeah.
And I,

1019
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,320
yeah,
it's,

1020
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,110
it's true.
I'm from Queens originally.

1021
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,621
Well,
you know,

1022
00:44:33,621 --> 00:44:36,720
it's Kinda crazy is I guarantee you
it's,

1023
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,370
it is a high possibility that someone in
one of those camps is listening to you

1024
00:44:40,371 --> 00:44:41,210
right now.
Oh,

1025
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,490
absolutely.
Podcasts that have downloaded it from

1026
00:44:43,491 --> 00:44:44,324
the Internet.

1027
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,930
No,
it's absolutely,

1028
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:47,420
it's absolutely true.
Um,

1029
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,960
I wonder,
I feel like if you're like,

1030
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,570
if someone who's listening is listening,
you know,

1031
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:56,010
from a camper is listening,
you know,

1032
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:59,580
in a refugee situation like I man,
how cool would it be to get someone like

1033
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:01,920
that on your show as a guest?
If there is like a way with skype or

1034
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:03,000
something,
that'd be amazing.

1035
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:07,290
I have to clear it with Donald Trump.
Make sure he thinks or our Syrian voices

1036
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:09,120
allowed into the country or would that
cause isis,

1037
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:12,900
does isis come from Syrian voices?
It's a disease of the mind.

1038
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,740
He wants to stop the Internet to the
Middle East.

1039
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:17,840
Have you heard this?
This is the latest Donald Trump thing.

1040
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,880
I had a signing last night,
so I unfortunately I missed the

1041
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,430
intellectual glory.
That was the republican debate.

1042
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:24,580
So fill me in on this.
Okay.

1043
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,700
Didn't see it.
But he was talking about this,

1044
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,840
that one of the things that they would
do or he would do is knock off the

1045
00:45:31,841 --> 00:45:34,240
internet to certain parts of the Middle
East.

1046
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,040
Why like how's that?

1047
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,910
Well,
because that's how they're plotting

1048
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:41,910
against us.
Molly crab apple while you sit in your

1049
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:46,140
wonderful New York apartment writing
books about sex,

1050
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,110
the terrorists,
the terrorists are winning.

1051
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,760
Oh God.
I mean does so in Isis territories that

1052
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:57,650
those fuckers are occupying,
they got rid of private Internet access

1053
00:45:57,651 --> 00:45:59,850
in people's homes because they're really
scared of the Internet.

1054
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:02,210
Two,
they are super scared because there are

1055
00:46:02,211 --> 00:46:05,610
all these citizen activists and
journalists that are revealing shit

1056
00:46:05,611 --> 00:46:08,400
about them on the Internet right now.
Like if you're in rock cod,

1057
00:46:08,401 --> 00:46:12,840
the only way to even get online is to be
on these Internet cafes that are kind of

1058
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,990
run by dudes with Isis connections.
Whoa.

1059
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,690
And,
and um,

1060
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,900
that's because isis is also really
fucking scared of the Internet.

1061
00:46:21,901 --> 00:46:23,610
They really don't like it.
Really?

1062
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,630
Yeah.
Why is that?

1063
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,260
Well,
because a lot of Syrians living and

1064
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:33,020
Iraqis living in their territories
fucking hate them and they give Intel on

1065
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,780
them.
Two,

1066
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,030
um,
foreign journalists.

1067
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,860
That's fascinating.
So the Internet acts as a way that they

1068
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:44,560
communicate and establish plans,
but it also acts as something that's

1069
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,100
plotting against them.
Exactly.

1070
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,200
Same as the internet does it everywhere
else.

1071
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:48,771
No,
I mean,

1072
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:51,080
it's just communication.
It's just people.

1073
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,750
Yeah.
When you're a group of [inaudible] that

1074
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:56,300
the whole world hates and your online
guarantee,

1075
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:57,260
you're going to get some haters.

1076
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,860
Yeah.
I mean there's a,

1077
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,550
there's one group of,
um,

1078
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:04,620
journalists there that became very
famous that's called Brocka as being

1079
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:09,621
silently slaughtered that,
I mean they did tons of work documenting

1080
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,420
isis shit and isis,
I mean beheaded two of their members

1081
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,250
that were in Turkey and there are plenty
of other citizen journalists there and

1082
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,320
yeah,
isis is dead scared of normal of normal

1083
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:23,370
people who are living under their
fucking occupation using the internet.

1084
00:47:23,371 --> 00:47:24,204
They hate it.

1085
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,001
You know,
another thing,

1086
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:27,100
they're scared,
they're scared of being killed by women.

1087
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,650
So that's kind of,
I think,

1088
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,280
I think

1089
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,310
this is my theory that um,
the Kurdish group,

1090
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:35,410
they won't go to heaven if a curtis girl
kills them thing.

1091
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,520
I think like one person said that and
then it still how much play it got in

1092
00:47:39,521 --> 00:47:41,020
the media and they were like,
aw man,

1093
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:42,160
this is good pr.
Let's keep it,

1094
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:44,680
let's keep milking this one.
I think so,

1095
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,070
yeah.
That's,

1096
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,720
it makes sense.
Ideologically,

1097
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:49,230
like within their religion.
Is that something that they believe in?

1098
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,280
She get killed by a woman.
You don't get all the virgins.

1099
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,540
No,
I think that's bullshit.

1100
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,490
I think that would be,
I think maybe there's like a macho

1101
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:55,570
thing,
you know where they're like,

1102
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,640
well fuck a girl,
girl shot my leg,

1103
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:59,650
but I,
it's not a theological thing.

1104
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,050
Damn.
It seems so good though.

1105
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,033
I know.
It really,

1106
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,430
it seemed,
it seems sweet,

1107
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,750
like some crazy Amazon scenario
chasing isis and they just run away

1108
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,770
because they're scared of being killed
by the women who are fighting Isis in

1109
00:48:14,771 --> 00:48:17,560
the Ypj or you know,
ferocious soldiers.

1110
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,300
But either isis is scared of getting,
they're scared of getting killed.

1111
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:25,200
Our soldiers were really allocated or if
that was true though,

1112
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:30,580
allocated our resources correctly,
I think there's probably enough really

1113
00:48:30,581 --> 00:48:33,190
mean bitches in the world.
We could put together a hell of a

1114
00:48:33,191 --> 00:48:34,340
fucking army.
I think so.

1115
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,160
I think so too,
with tons of motivation.

1116
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,820
Could you imagine just jet jetson
bombers

1117
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,750
piloted by women?
Like that's it.

1118
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:47,190
Only women.
Only women going after Isis because if

1119
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,990
they get killed by these women,
there are Fox and they don't get to go

1120
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,210
to heaven.
I think.

1121
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,570
I think you'd have to do like a more,
I think at the bombings aren't doing

1122
00:48:55,571 --> 00:48:58,960
shit against Isis.
I think the Ypg is doing is,

1123
00:48:58,961 --> 00:49:00,910
you know,
I think I'd have to be more on the

1124
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,330
ground.
Well,

1125
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:04,960
especially in Afghanistan,
right?

1126
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,860
That's one of the things that people
have always had a problem with invading

1127
00:49:08,861 --> 00:49:09,550
Afghanistan.

1128
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,060
It's essentially a series of mountain
ranges occupied by warlords.

1129
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:16,420
There's not like,
there's not a lot of access.

1130
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:19,420
It's not so easy to get to.
The thing with Isis is what they do is

1131
00:49:19,421 --> 00:49:20,350
they,
I mean they move in,

1132
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,150
they occupy cities like a military
occupation and they try to marry people

1133
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,640
and build families and they try to
insert themselves as much as possible

1134
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,650
into the fabric of a city.
And that's partially,

1135
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:33,320
in part,
it's them making it so that if,

1136
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,193
if you,
you know,

1137
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,730
bombed Rocca,
he would be murdering hundreds of

1138
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,240
thousands of innocent civilians who were
just too poor to get out to do it.

1139
00:49:40,241 --> 00:49:43,840
Strategically embed themselves as a
human shield.

1140
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:44,951
Yeah,
exactly.

1141
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:49,510
And like there were,
I mean the majority of Rocca is there

1142
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:53,470
like farmers who couldn't afford to get
out because it's expensive to even get

1143
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:56,470
out of Syria.
What a mess.

1144
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:58,240
What a crazy,
chaotic,

1145
00:49:58,241 --> 00:50:00,820
psychotic mess.
It's really bizarre.

1146
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:04,090
That member,
that Obama speech that he had on

1147
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:07,030
television,
was it a year or so ago or he was

1148
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:11,740
talking about eminent military action
against Syria and the whole country

1149
00:50:11,741 --> 00:50:14,140
went,
what are you fucking crazy?

1150
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,820
And then it just,
it just stopped.

1151
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,930
Literally like silence.
Like you didn't hear anything more about

1152
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:21,670
it.
They just completely backed off just

1153
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:24,160
because Republicans and Democrats,
everyone was like,

1154
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:27,690
are you out of your fucking mind?
Like what could happen in look what

1155
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:27,980
happened

1156
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,610
in Afghanistan?
Look at the,

1157
00:50:29,611 --> 00:50:33,620
the massive negative reaction the
American public has had all these

1158
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:36,290
military actions.
You're going to start up a new one on in

1159
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:38,900
Syria for what reason?
Because somebody got gassed because they

1160
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:40,300
gas people.
Like what do you,

1161
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,780
what you,
what's going on that we need to

1162
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,600
sacrifice American lives over there.
Exactly.

1163
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,130
Like what's the cause of all this?

1164
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,670
I mean,
what's really sort of a so tragic about

1165
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:50,990
Syria is that,
um,

1166
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,390
Obama,
um,

1167
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,730
this,
this is me saying an opinion that's not

1168
00:50:55,731 --> 00:50:57,470
necessarily mine,
but it's opinion of that I've gotten

1169
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,690
from speaking to refugees.
It,

1170
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:02,510
um,
a lot of people I think felt very led on

1171
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,920
by what Obama said and they felt like,
oh,

1172
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:07,910
there's going to be,
you know,

1173
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:12,911
some support or I don't know,
some action against Assad because I mean

1174
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:17,060
whatever one thinks about American
intervention or not intervention,

1175
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,470
what asides did is a crime against
humanity on a massive scale.

1176
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,330
What,
whatever we think do you think we should

1177
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,890
have done what he did was fucking
horrific.

1178
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:29,060
And anyone who is in Syria and you know
who was at the receiving end of that

1179
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,010
would very often once someone else to
intervene and explain to people what he

1180
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:39,011
did do,
he ran like an industrial scale,

1181
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:42,140
um,
arrest,

1182
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:46,850
torture killing program.
He does something called barrel

1183
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:49,760
bombings,
which are taking like basically like

1184
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:53,900
dumpsters full of t and t and shrapnel
and dropping them in populated areas to

1185
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:54,920
target schools,
targets.

1186
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:58,670
Hospitals are destroyed.
A large swathes of Aleppo.

1187
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,270
And this isn't,
this isn't me saying,

1188
00:52:02,271 --> 00:52:06,070
um,
this isn't me saying that I think the US

1189
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,290
should have intervened because I,
I,

1190
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:10,790
I still don't know.
But I,

1191
00:52:10,791 --> 00:52:13,770
I'm very against the US intervening in
general and anything cause I think we

1192
00:52:13,771 --> 00:52:16,490
always fuck it up.
But he also factually didn't do those

1193
00:52:16,491 --> 00:52:17,324
things.

1194
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,420
It's just hard to imagine that someone
is capable of doing shit like that

1195
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,400
where people can get to,
where people can get through in their

1196
00:52:29,401 --> 00:52:33,030
minds that the,
that allows them to do shit like that.

1197
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,800
I think what it was was his,
one of the things that was quite

1198
00:52:36,801 --> 00:52:41,801
influential was his father put down,
I'm sort of incipient insurgency

1199
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:44,870
opposition thing,
uh,

1200
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:49,670
in a city called Hama by killing 20,000
people and like bombing the fuck out of

1201
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:51,040
the city and it,
it put it,

1202
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:54,770
put it down.
And I think that perhaps in his mind he

1203
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:58,040
thought that he could do the same when
there was an uprising against him.

1204
00:52:58,041 --> 00:52:59,870
But obviously that wasn't what happened.

1205
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,070
Well that's um,
I mean that's a story of Saddam Hussein

1206
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:06,420
and his sons as well.
I imagine being the son of a,

1207
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,440
an evil,
brutal dictator.

1208
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:09,693
Yeah.
And you're just like,

1209
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,680
well,
those sons was ended up like these

1210
00:53:11,681 --> 00:53:13,410
fucking nero figures.
Don't say it.

1211
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,930
I mean,
it's like the father is very often like

1212
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:21,931
a thuggish military guy and then the sun
is this a princeling who always got

1213
00:53:22,781 --> 00:53:25,150
whatever he wanted in his life and
that's when it gets so,

1214
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,040
so weird.
You see

1215
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,440
with like Kim Jong Il also.
Exactly.

1216
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:30,870
Yeah.
And Uday and Qusay is,

1217
00:53:30,871 --> 00:53:32,160
I would assume,
yeah,

1218
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:36,060
those motherfuckers who,
God or it's more horrible stories about

1219
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:37,980
what they would do.
They would find women that were getting

1220
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,830
married and they would take them from
their husband,

1221
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,350
rape them,
and then feed them to dogs.

1222
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,830
They had dogs that they had in their
basement that they just didn't feed.

1223
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:49,950
And they would throw people that they
didn't like to their dogs and the dogs

1224
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:52,620
are Tam apart.
Whoa.

1225
00:53:53,570 --> 00:53:55,740
And then they would watch of course.
But the,

1226
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:58,050
the,
the fact that a person can get to that

1227
00:53:58,051 --> 00:54:00,450
place,
that a person can get to that place

1228
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:05,451
where they eat w in the weirdest way.
We're flexible in a beautiful way.

1229
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,850
You know,
when you can see someone who can create

1230
00:54:08,851 --> 00:54:13,770
beautiful songs and art and they can
touch people with their words and their

1231
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:15,990
thoughts and their deeds and you know,
they can,

1232
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,900
they can be something inspirational and
amazing,

1233
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:23,910
but we're also flexible in this horrific
way where they could play upon the worst

1234
00:54:23,911 --> 00:54:27,720
fears and the worst,
the worst emotions that people are

1235
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:30,000
capable of manifesting.

1236
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And they could just just attack and
torture and maim and brutalized and

1237
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:40,830
murdered and they could do it wantonly
and do it with no for no real reason.

1238
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:45,150
They could do it sadistically for fun,
for recreation.

1239
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:49,050
The fact that that that's the same beast
has just,

1240
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:53,460
they're human beings and it's like,
I mean there could obviously be some

1241
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:58,410
anomalies in the brain itself,
but essentially a good portion of what

1242
00:54:58,411 --> 00:55:03,411
makes a person who they are is their
environment and their life experiences

1243
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,070
and the nurturing and like how they were
raised and what they're exposed to.

1244
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,580
And we get,
we're so flexible and pliable because we

1245
00:55:11,581 --> 00:55:16,581
want to survive that we're capable the
same species during the same time

1246
00:55:16,681 --> 00:55:18,510
period.
We're not talking about like cave people

1247
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:21,510
that cannibalize because they didn't
have books than it and understand it was

1248
00:55:21,511 --> 00:55:25,560
bad and they had invented language yet
over talking about people with the

1249
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:28,380
Internet,
they're capable of doing these horrific

1250
00:55:28,381 --> 00:55:30,840
things,
but at the same time there's someone

1251
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,430
like,
you know what I mean?

1252
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:34,350
You fill in the blank.
There's a lot of beautiful people out

1253
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:37,510
there that do things,
but my friend Justin wren was um,

1254
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,010
from these photos over here who goes to
the Congo and he lives with the pygmies

1255
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:44,760
for six months a year and he,
he need builds wells for them and he

1256
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:47,910
gets malaria and almost dies and you
know,

1257
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,570
he's an American from Texas.
He just went over there and saw how

1258
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,270
incredible these people were and he
dedicates his life to it.

1259
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:55,051
He's like,
to me,

1260
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,420
he's like one of my favorite people
because he's just like this beautiful

1261
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:02,070
manifestation of like experiencing like
friendship and love from these people.

1262
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,040
Then just becoming incredibly dedicated
to try to take care of them.

1263
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,710
But these people exist at the same time.
It's just,

1264
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,190
it's so hard to understand like a parent
is a fucking parrot.

1265
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,540
You know,
some parents you can tame and they'll

1266
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:16,800
eat peanuts out of your hand and other
ones they live in the trees,

1267
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:20,160
but they're fucking parrots and were
like everything all at once.

1268
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:23,500
We're so,
we're so weird or so weird,

1269
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,360
you know?
I mean I'm a fan of people,

1270
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:28,390
don't get me wrong,
but here you're pro people.

1271
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,940
I'm a huge fan of people.
I love people.

1272
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:34,660
I think we're amazing but we're also
horrible.

1273
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,291
You know,
it's,

1274
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,460
it's what we're capable of is so strict
cause like,

1275
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:41,650
you know,
like you or I are not capable of those

1276
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:43,570
things.
So for us to see that,

1277
00:56:43,571 --> 00:56:46,570
like what we consider a horrible person
in America,

1278
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:50,890
it's like someone who's says something
horrible on,

1279
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,890
you know,
on twitter about race or something like

1280
00:56:53,891 --> 00:56:55,810
that or someone who's a,
you know,

1281
00:56:55,811 --> 00:56:58,720
disparaging about President Obama or you
know,

1282
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:01,990
it's like,
it's so minor and a lot of ways what we

1283
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:04,300
shame people for here,
you know,

1284
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,090
he didn't use the correct gender pronoun
you piece of Shit.

1285
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,490
You know,
meanwhile there's terrible,

1286
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:14,491
terrible things that are going on at the
same part of the world in the same time

1287
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,670
in other parts of the world.

1288
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,121
I mean,
I,

1289
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,540
I don't believe in our race to the
bottom.

1290
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:18,650
It shouldn't be like,
well,

1291
00:57:18,651 --> 00:57:20,660
you haven't like thrown someone to the
dog,

1292
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:21,780
so you're cool,
you know?

1293
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,073
No,
but I,

1294
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:25,490
I definitely,
I,

1295
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,210
I definitely hear where you're coming
from.

1296
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,370
Hm.
That is funny,

1297
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:31,200
right?
You can always look at like Saddam

1298
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,570
Hussein's kids and I'm like,
I'm fine.

1299
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:37,520
Feel like all I did was punch a baby.
I did not dog shamed me if my dad

1300
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:40,670
punching,
shaming sharing's a new thing.

1301
00:57:40,671 --> 00:57:42,680
Right.
When did shaming come around?

1302
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,480
I mean,
public shaming,

1303
00:57:44,481 --> 00:57:48,260
like the term
public shaming is sort of an old

1304
00:57:48,261 --> 00:57:50,180
American tradition.
We have a book called the scarlet letter

1305
00:57:50,181 --> 00:57:51,440
about public shaming.
Yeah.

1306
00:57:51,441 --> 00:57:53,540
But not as a phrase,
you know,

1307
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,750
like fat shaming,
you know what you mean when it,

1308
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:57,830
when it became,
um,

1309
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:01,580
slut shaming.
Like these terms are very new.

1310
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:04,010
These are like,
these are like this new concepts.

1311
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,020
I mean,
I think that they're their new corn.

1312
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:09,110
Just to describe,
to describe,

1313
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,040
um,
you know,

1314
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,970
old behavior.
The truth is I do think people should be

1315
00:58:13,971 --> 00:58:16,410
criticized for like,
I dunno,

1316
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,650
I feel like if you're going on twitter
and you're writing,

1317
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:22,310
you're a dumb whore to random women.
Like that is jerk ass behavior and

1318
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:24,370
people should tell you that you're being
a fucking jerk for it.

1319
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:26,570
And she's really into it.
That's her thing.

1320
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,060
She's previously expressed days.
She says previously expressed a desire

1321
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:32,871
for that.
Yeah.

1322
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:34,160
They have like an established
relationship.

1323
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:35,030
You're a dumb whore.
Oh,

1324
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:36,910
you fucker get over here.
Like,

1325
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,630
yeah,
no creek previous consent,

1326
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,510
but here's rent to random random women
who don't have that in their twitter

1327
00:58:41,511 --> 00:58:42,610
bio.
That that's what they're into.

1328
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,740
I think like you were being a jerk ass.
I'm someone who's like,

1329
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,170
fuck you.
Stop calling random women whores on

1330
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:49,190
twitter.
Oh yeah.

1331
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,450
I think that,
I think that's fine.

1332
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,300
That what we were talking about before
about having no,

1333
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,470
um,
that one day we're going to come a time

1334
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:57,300
where there's no boundaries between
people.

1335
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,750
I'm really absolutely convinced this.
Like,

1336
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:00,271
I've,
I've,

1337
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:02,940
uh,
I've had these weird,

1338
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,970
um,
trips in a sensory deprivation tank

1339
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,000
where I've sort of seen this take place,
the slow acceptance of what is the

1340
00:59:11,101 --> 00:59:15,090
ultimate inevitable reality.
And it kind of freaks me out sometimes I

1341
00:59:15,091 --> 00:59:17,950
have to get out of the tank cause I just
can't handle it because I really,

1342
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,920
I think like life as a person,
we have this idea that we're gonna put

1343
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:24,050
our shell on and we're good.
I've got Michelle on,

1344
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:25,990
this is going to be no shells.
It's,

1345
00:59:25,991 --> 00:59:28,010
it's,
we're gonna just have to somehow or

1346
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,690
another like,
you know how you have friends?

1347
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,370
Like I have friends that,
uh,

1348
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:33,650
I'm almost too close to them.
I know everything they do.

1349
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:34,490
You know,
like,

1350
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,121
what'd you do?
Ah,

1351
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:36,470
you fuck her?
Why'd you do that?

1352
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,550
Oh my God,
what are you doing?

1353
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,570
I just fucking lost my mind.
And,

1354
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,620
but you know,
everything like we're going to know that

1355
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,720
about everybody.
It's just a matter of time.

1356
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,350
But the thing is I don't think it's
going to make us nicer to each other and

1357
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:50,930
make us like each other better.
I think that one of the things that

1358
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,920
twitter has done,
I mean,

1359
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,900
I love twitter,
like I'm addicted to twitter.

1360
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:55,340
I love it.
I think it's really cool.

1361
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:59,330
But in addition to having a speak to all
sorts of amazing people that we never

1362
00:59:59,331 --> 01:00:02,660
would have spoken to before,
it also like really revealed what other

1363
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:06,830
people were thinking and made us like
really dislike them for it to knit a lot

1364
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:07,550
of ways.
Right?

1365
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:08,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

1366
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:13,280
Well it's also the anonymity,
the ability to reach out to molly and

1367
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:16,160
just say some mean shit anonymously.
You know,

1368
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:19,160
you're just this little egg.
I'm a little egg,

1369
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,630
you know,
that's all your,

1370
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:22,520
your icon is.
And you know,

1371
01:00:22,521 --> 01:00:26,840
you have been a series of letters to
represent your egg and then you're like,

1372
01:00:26,841 --> 01:00:30,080
fuck you molly crab asshole.
You fucking bitch already your bull

1373
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:30,611
shit.
I mean,

1374
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:33,050
I believe that's how it went down.
I think you're a fucking attention

1375
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,050
whore.
Yeah,

1376
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:34,581
yeah,
yeah.

1377
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:35,560
And then you read that,
you're like,

1378
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,473
oh,

1379
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,670
you know,
you've fucking anonymous person is

1380
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,190
searing my soul with your hate

1381
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,210
mean.
I don't like.

1382
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,800
I get a lot of like as a,
as I'm sure you do.

1383
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:48,820
I think.
Okay,

1384
01:00:48,821 --> 01:00:50,680
so this is the thing.
Sometimes the thing that helps him put

1385
01:00:50,681 --> 01:00:54,760
it in perspective is I got 70,000
twitter followers and I think if I ever

1386
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:58,210
had any other grouping,
like any real life grouping of 70,000

1387
01:00:58,211 --> 01:00:59,950
people,
like what would be the jackass ratio

1388
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:01,210
that I would expect in that

1389
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,920
it's always one in 100 that's my
thought.

1390
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,640
My thought is it's one,
it's the real 1% we should be concerned

1391
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:10,360
with the jackass 1% the mean people.
Yeah,

1392
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,700
because I think they're,
they're so,

1393
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,720
they're so calm.
Like the idea of the 1% being like the

1394
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:16,880
real problem in America being successful
people.

1395
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,030
I think if you've got the 1% of all the
successful people together,

1396
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:24,080
only 1% of them would be evil cunts.
I really believe that.

1397
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:27,500
I think 1% of Pr,
I think you keep going with the 1% like

1398
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:29,570
how many of those will add of those
people that are evil,

1399
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:32,330
how many of them are true sociopath?
Probably ones percent of them too.

1400
01:01:32,331 --> 01:01:33,560
I was like,
he keeps going.

1401
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:38,830
But if you have 300 million people,
you're dealing with 3 million assholes.

1402
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,110
Like if there's a hundred people,
one of them is going to suck.

1403
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:46,610
And if you have 300 million,
you have 3 million people that suck.

1404
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,890
And if they all get ahold of your
twitter account,

1405
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,600
you're going to think the world has
ended.

1406
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:54,170
You're going to think my God and you
won't see the other 99.

1407
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,160
You won't see them because the hateful
words of the one will just be

1408
01:01:58,161 --> 01:02:00,350
overwhelming.
And every now and then molly,

1409
01:02:00,351 --> 01:02:02,100
your book's amazing collection.

1410
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:05,790
Yeah,
you'll,

1411
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:06,960
you'll try to find it.
I mean,

1412
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:08,820
I've watched people in scale,
like I had,

1413
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,390
like we were talking about Lance
Armstrong and I looked at the mentions

1414
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:16,410
that Lance Armstrong gets on twitter.
Like anything he writes and like

1415
01:02:16,411 --> 01:02:18,660
anything he wrote like had a great time,
you know,

1416
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:19,740
uh,
doing these,

1417
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:21,900
uh,
this race was as good at times when

1418
01:02:21,901 --> 01:02:24,250
you're running away from drug tests,
like sake,

1419
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,580
I think they can't help it.
It's like they,

1420
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,410
people just love to dig.
They just love to fucking reach out of

1421
01:02:31,411 --> 01:02:33,240
that rib cage,
pull out your heart.

1422
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:35,130
Ah,
they can't help it.

1423
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:39,540
They know they can.
And it's also a new ability that human

1424
01:02:39,541 --> 01:02:43,260
beings have sort of cultivated over the
last couple of decades really didn't

1425
01:02:43,261 --> 01:02:44,190
exist before.
Well,

1426
01:02:44,191 --> 01:02:46,320
before,
like you would had to have like written

1427
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:46,600
on

1428
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,900
letter left your mom's basement,
walked all the way down to the block.

1429
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:55,310
Humans basement.
Why don't I say like Your Dad's base and

1430
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:57,730
your girlfriend's based and there's so
many other basements these people could

1431
01:02:57,731 --> 01:02:58,870
be in.
Like why do I have to put them all in

1432
01:02:58,871 --> 01:03:01,000
their mom's basement?
Because it's somehow or another for a

1433
01:03:01,001 --> 01:03:02,590
man,
the most pathetic thing.

1434
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:03,730
Like,
mom,

1435
01:03:03,731 --> 01:03:04,700
I'm done here.
Mom.

1436
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,130
Stop yelling.
I'm down.

1437
01:03:06,131 --> 01:03:07,660
You're telling people they're wrong on
the internet.

1438
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:11,540
You're typing up a fucking stone.
We're trying to hurt land,

1439
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,100
shine,
kneeling,

1440
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,430
cycling,
lying.

1441
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:19,440
Yeah.

1442
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,400
I like,
I liked that.

1443
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:21,180
That was,
that was a,

1444
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:22,013
that was a good,
uh,

1445
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:23,610
good personification of that.

1446
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:28,610
It's like this feeling of just wanting
to just somehow or another get a

1447
01:03:28,611 --> 01:03:31,880
reaction and it's all losers.
That's unfortunate.

1448
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:33,740
I mean,
I hate to say that to those people,

1449
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:34,370
right?
They're like,

1450
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:35,090
no,
no,

1451
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:36,140
I'm a,
I'm a winner.

1452
01:03:36,141 --> 01:03:38,810
And I think he just,
what he did was dishonorable.

1453
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,580
Okay,
well then you might think it,

1454
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:43,310
but if you actually are sitting around
trying to attack him,

1455
01:03:43,311 --> 01:03:48,110
I guarantee you that his energy and
focus that you could have best spent on

1456
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:49,610
your own life 100%

1457
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:53,400
or like maybe if you're just like,
I mean critical person who is a winner,

1458
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:56,490
you could have written a really great
essay about like juicing in the sport

1459
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,420
that like really took him down and then,
yeah,

1460
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,450
and then you have challenged,
you're like meaning this in a positive

1461
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:01,430
and winning direction.

1462
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,960
But if you really looked at the essay,
honestly,

1463
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:06,090
you'd have to take down the whole sport
itself.

1464
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:09,510
You mean you really wouldn't.
Who if you want to take down Lance

1465
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,530
Armstrong,
you'd have to take them down by his

1466
01:04:10,531 --> 01:04:15,270
individual acts actions in defending his
actions in the sport.

1467
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,290
Yeah.
That,

1468
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,430
that's,
that's,

1469
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:21,600
he admits that he,
he's pretty open about the fact that he

1470
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:25,080
fucked up and then he made some pretty
horrible choices.

1471
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,980
Does it though the sport itself,
like if you really wanted to write an

1472
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:30,900
essay,
you'd write what the fuck you bunch of

1473
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:33,230
steroid using bike riders.
That's what you got.

1474
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,790
Yeah.
And you'd write like properly about the

1475
01:04:35,791 --> 01:04:39,930
economic impetus and how all the ways
that like top people were able to kind

1476
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:42,540
of condone it but then get out with
their hands clean and you'd write

1477
01:04:42,541 --> 01:04:45,480
something like that really channeled
your meaning this into a positive

1478
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,680
direction that really tore shit.

1479
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,240
Yeah.
That's a weird thing about blogs too

1480
01:04:49,241 --> 01:04:50,340
though.
There's a lot of pee.

1481
01:04:50,341 --> 01:04:52,380
I've,
I've read some really mean blogs.

1482
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,660
People write about folks and I'm like,
what's interesting about this is like

1483
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,960
blogs or not a conversation.
It's like you're,

1484
01:04:58,961 --> 01:04:59,720
you have this,
uh,

1485
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,530
attack,
this focused attack of,

1486
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:06,190
of an individual.
But if that individual was there and

1487
01:05:06,191 --> 01:05:08,620
they could respond to this and you could
have a communicate,

1488
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:11,140
it would be a different thing.
Like what it is is like,

1489
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:12,200
uh,
it's like a,

1490
01:05:12,201 --> 01:05:16,210
a message tied to the Clav,
a raven that you're sending out.

1491
01:05:16,211 --> 01:05:16,700
Like it's,
there's,

1492
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,660
so it's such a one way thing.
It's,

1493
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:24,010
it's not,
it's not really an effective way to

1494
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:26,890
communicate cause you're not really
trying to communicate.

1495
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:30,700
We tried to do is hurt somebody.
Like when you see attack blogs,

1496
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,080
I mean they're the worst.
Yeah.

1497
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,640
Well there's,
there's some that deserve it.

1498
01:05:33,641 --> 01:05:38,260
Like if you could write an an expo,
say on someone who runs some horrible

1499
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:41,830
business that is using slave labor or
fill in the blank on some terrible

1500
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:43,410
scenario that you could expose.
Yeah,

1501
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:43,991
I mean the,
the,

1502
01:05:43,991 --> 01:05:45,940
the world should see it like,
okay here Matt,

1503
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:49,190
Tie Ebs Expos,
a's on the financial collapse.

1504
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:50,920
Brilliant,
perfect.

1505
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,490
And you know that those are real,
legitimate and important.

1506
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,500
But I've read some things that people
written,

1507
01:05:56,501 --> 01:05:58,930
they're just about like random
celebrities or you know,

1508
01:05:58,931 --> 01:05:59,260
like

1509
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,310
you're just like why?
Why are you that invested in tyler

1510
01:06:02,311 --> 01:06:04,160
swift?
Like how do you have so much opinion

1511
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:05,033
then it's Taylor.

1512
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:08,100
Fuck,
I'm not fucking Dork.

1513
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:11,910
I don't know anything.
Well I'm a fucking Dork to haters.

1514
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:12,950
Gonna hate,
hate,

1515
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:14,880
hate that fucking song.
I liked that song,

1516
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:16,800
goddammit.
Cause I have daughters and I have a wife

1517
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,080
that God damn songs playing all the
time.

1518
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:20,820
They play in the car.
When I'm with them,

1519
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:21,660
I'm like,
that's okay,

1520
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,310
you can play that one.
I liked that one.

1521
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,510
Cool.
That's awesome.

1522
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:30,090
Sudden I'm embarrassed that I like it.
It shows like diverse musical tastes.

1523
01:06:30,091 --> 01:06:30,924
That's all right.

1524
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:33,210
Definitely have that.
Sometimes too diverse,

1525
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:34,710
you know.
But um,

1526
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,980
I dunno how we got onto that,
but it's like,

1527
01:06:37,981 --> 01:06:40,440
yeah,
like mean takedowns of like a some

1528
01:06:40,441 --> 01:06:45,420
singer like come on really is this
terrible person really affecting your

1529
01:06:45,421 --> 01:06:49,440
life in some strange way.
But the like the comments that people

1530
01:06:49,441 --> 01:06:52,830
will make to people,
I believe on twitter and facebook,

1531
01:06:52,831 --> 01:06:53,850
all these,
and not facebook,

1532
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:57,900
it's like slightly less anonymous,
but all these anonymous methods of

1533
01:06:57,901 --> 01:07:01,740
communicating,
they're gonna dissolve slowly but surely

1534
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:06,080
the boundaries between people.
It's not just going to be the NSA that

1535
01:07:06,081 --> 01:07:08,730
can find out exactly what you're doing
and who's saying what to who.

1536
01:07:08,731 --> 01:07:10,440
It's going to be the whole fucking
world.

1537
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:14,040
Everyone's going to be able to do that
and it's going to be very,

1538
01:07:14,041 --> 01:07:15,570
very weird.
Very weird.

1539
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:16,980
The other thing is like,
people,

1540
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,490
we'll find out the people who are doing
that.

1541
01:07:19,491 --> 01:07:24,491
I remember there was this like asshole
who made a bunch of twitter accounts to

1542
01:07:25,391 --> 01:07:29,060
um,
right that women who worked in tech but

1543
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:32,270
then just brand and women,
he didn't like cunts and he really

1544
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:35,060
fixated on this one woman who is a
programmer at Tor,

1545
01:07:35,061 --> 01:07:38,690
which is an anonymous web browser.
And he like made seven twitter accounts

1546
01:07:38,691 --> 01:07:40,280
at one point until I tell her she was a
cunt.

1547
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,510
And so finally she was like,
she was like this,

1548
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:47,160
this has gone on long enough.
And um,

1549
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:52,180
when he was visiting her website,
presumably to find more proof that she

1550
01:07:52,461 --> 01:07:55,130
was a [inaudible],
she got his Ip address track down where

1551
01:07:55,131 --> 01:07:56,960
he worked in,
posted his name and his workplace.

1552
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,780
And with the line that was like his
classic,

1553
01:07:59,781 --> 01:08:01,340
she wrote should have used tour
foucault.

1554
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,300
I was like,
you know,

1555
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,240
if you went up to a bunch of bunch of

1556
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,140
women or if you went on to a bunch of
women at bars and just screamed like

1557
01:08:10,141 --> 01:08:12,750
cunt in their face,
like eventually either them or their

1558
01:08:12,751 --> 01:08:14,400
boyfriend or someone around is going to
hit you.

1559
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:16,010
But because were doing this online

1560
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,761
you thought like,
wow,

1561
01:08:16,761 --> 01:08:18,100
I can just go up to people and scream
content.

1562
01:08:18,101 --> 01:08:19,880
Nothing's ever going to happen.
And some,

1563
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:22,460
you know it did.
And there's no one's going to be

1564
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:25,970
sympathetic to anyone's going to get
seven twitter accounts just to call some

1565
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:26,990
woman a con.
Yeah.

1566
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,420
No,
no one feels bad that he got hit that he

1567
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:33,470
got dogs were guy got talks.
Well he was just expressing himself and

1568
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:36,290
exercising his first amendment rights.
No,

1569
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:38,200
I think um,
I really think we're,

1570
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:43,370
we're maybe a few years away from that
just not being around anymore from it

1571
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:47,450
being some strange new world or we're
all going to know exactly.

1572
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:52,910
I think I re I really believe that it's,
we're maybe 10 years away from being

1573
01:08:52,911 --> 01:08:55,610
able to reach those thoughts.
Oh God.

1574
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:57,170
Can you imagine?
Yeah.

1575
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:58,520
It's going to be very strange.
Let's get the,

1576
01:08:58,521 --> 01:09:02,990
all the romance and thinks is going to
be gone because so much of like so much

1577
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:07,991
of like really exciting things in life
is like anticipating and not knowing.

1578
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,200
And then,
you know,

1579
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:12,050
it's almost like the unwrapping of
Christmas presents like,

1580
01:09:12,051 --> 01:09:13,640
well,
like when someone texts you,

1581
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:14,720
Hey,
what are you doing?

1582
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:15,740
And you're like,
yes,

1583
01:09:15,741 --> 01:09:17,690
it's her book.
You know,

1584
01:09:17,691 --> 01:09:20,090
like there's that,
that moment where you didn't know

1585
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:22,100
someone likes you or not like what's
going on?

1586
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:24,950
And then you're going back and forth
with each other is sending each other

1587
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:28,820
emails or you get that phone call out of
the blue from someone he didn't know.

1588
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:30,470
They really were in the you and you're
like,

1589
01:09:30,471 --> 01:09:33,260
yeah,
but when you know everyone's thoughts,

1590
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:34,820
it's going to be like all the Rome,
ah,

1591
01:09:34,821 --> 01:09:35,990
your enemy.
You fucker.

1592
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:36,980
Why?
Why are you playing?

1593
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:39,820
There's going to be no playing cool.
There's going to be no,

1594
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,570
you know that all the,
you know,

1595
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,850
you're,
when you go to apply for a job,

1596
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:44,391
you're like,
well,

1597
01:09:44,391 --> 01:09:46,570
you fucking unlike me so I'll just get
out of here.

1598
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:49,460
You think I'm a loser so you're not
going to hire me.

1599
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:54,410
This is not going to mean the illusions.
So although a lot of romance going to be

1600
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:57,710
gone a lot,
a lot of the fun of things is not

1601
01:09:57,711 --> 01:09:58,970
knowing.
You know,

1602
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:00,080
we don't like that though.

1603
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:01,811
No,
I'm an,

1604
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:02,870
I'm an artist.
I,

1605
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:05,680
I I like,
I like the not knowing.

1606
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:07,300
I like the mystery.
Sometimes

1607
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:11,410
it's fine as long as it works out.
Obviously it's worked out for you.

1608
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:13,570
You're a young woman,
you're already,

1609
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,910
you already have a book published.
You have many,

1610
01:10:15,911 --> 01:10:16,391
many,
many,

1611
01:10:16,391 --> 01:10:20,050
many art pieces published.
If journalism things that you've done.

1612
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:22,210
I was like,
it's worked out for you and all this

1613
01:10:22,211 --> 01:10:25,330
romance,
but for some people that's not happening

1614
01:10:25,331 --> 01:10:26,830
for them and they're like,
God dammit.

1615
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,830
I just think it would be better if there
was no secrets.

1616
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:33,520
But if you're that person and it wasn't
working out for you,

1617
01:10:34,060 --> 01:10:36,700
probably if there are no secrets,
you would just have the crushing

1618
01:10:36,701 --> 01:10:39,090
disappointment of realizing either no
one was thinking of you or they're

1619
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,400
thinking bad things about you when it
would just make you more unhappy maybe.

1620
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,960
But is what we are as human beings
currently.

1621
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:52,290
Is that a static state and is this a
state that we can expect to exist in,

1622
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:55,900
in sort of this form speaking with our
mouths,

1623
01:10:55,901 --> 01:10:59,590
making noises with our faces,
interpretating it,

1624
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:05,010
interpreting it in our own minds and,
and listening to other people say things

1625
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,680
and sort of establishing what their
meaning is that it is that does this is

1626
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:09,670
going to be forever.

1627
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:10,930
This is going to be how he went.
No,

1628
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:14,730
no fucking way.
Just like a monkey climbed off of a tree

1629
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:19,740
and you know,
and eventually became a person 200 plus

1630
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:21,930
thousand years later or whatever the
fuck it was.

1631
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:27,300
Whatever has led us to improve,
to become what we are today is a

1632
01:11:27,301 --> 01:11:29,430
continuous cycle.
It's not going to stop.

1633
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,730
And I think that this idea that what
we've got right now like,

1634
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:35,670
oh this,
the romance of not knowing and you know,

1635
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:38,130
it's amazing and it all works out well.
It's fucking,

1636
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,810
it's temporary.
This is a little,

1637
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:45,000
when we look back in time to the amount
of time that we've spent in this state,

1638
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:49,950
currently the Internet state,
it's been so brief but so transcendent.

1639
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:50,130
Okay.

1640
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:53,400
Absolutely.
It like the most transcendent thing.

1641
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:58,110
I mean I think as much or more than like
the printing press probably more my God,

1642
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:03,180
one of the like really good articles I
was reading about the refugee stuff is

1643
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:06,780
by the Iraqi journalists that I always
plug cause he's so brilliant.

1644
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:10,680
Plays up dual a hud and he did this
piece about,

1645
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,840
you know,
people making the trip and one of the

1646
01:12:12,841 --> 01:12:17,310
things he talked about is that this was
a trip that when he was a young man in

1647
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:18,890
Iraq,
he had tried to pay a smuggler to do and

1648
01:12:18,891 --> 01:12:21,480
the smuggler like defrauded him and he
didn't get to do it but it was all under

1649
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:24,630
the control of smugglers.
Whereas now if you have a cell phone,

1650
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:28,290
like once you get from Turkey to Greece,
once you do that little four hour boat

1651
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:31,440
ride,
he just put on the gps maps on your cell

1652
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,930
phone and you walk,
wow,

1653
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,830
you don't need smugglers after that.
Isn't that crazy?

1654
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,760
It completely up ended the end to this
entire like really like disgusting,

1655
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:43,020
nasty business.

1656
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:47,060
Well similar in a lot of ways to the
business of sneaking people over from

1657
01:12:47,061 --> 01:12:48,650
Mexico.
You know,

1658
01:12:48,651 --> 01:12:51,560
I have a friend who has been living in
America for

1659
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,600
more than 20 years because I've known
him for,

1660
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,240
I've known him for 18 years.
So He's,

1661
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:01,100
I think he's been living in America for
like 27,

1662
01:13:01,101 --> 01:13:03,020
28 years.
And that's how he came over.

1663
01:13:03,021 --> 01:13:06,920
I came over in a fucking van in the
middle of the night and they got out and

1664
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:09,320
there was a guy behind them that had a,
a stick,

1665
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:09,930
like,
uh,

1666
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:11,450
they,
they would take like a giant,

1667
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,360
like branch from a tree with all the
leaves.

1668
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:17,870
And as they walked,
one guy behind them would waive the

1669
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:20,540
branch back and forth to cover up their
footsteps.

1670
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:21,530
Yeah,
yeah.

1671
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,570
And they did it through the middle of
the night.

1672
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,733
And,
um,

1673
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:29,300
they eventually got to some sort of
border town where there was an Arizona

1674
01:13:29,301 --> 01:13:32,840
or whatever and uh,
they made their way and infiltrated into

1675
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,110
cities and eventually found jobs and
barely survived,

1676
01:13:36,530 --> 01:13:39,200
barely fed themselves.
And Fuck,

1677
01:13:39,201 --> 01:13:41,360
man,
he just imagined that life.

1678
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,780
And then there's all these people we've
got to tighten up our borders.

1679
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:45,811
Fuck man.
Like that,

1680
01:13:45,811 --> 01:13:47,100
that's high enough that the borders
shut.

1681
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:50,580
I mean,
trump's like idiot idea of that wall.

1682
01:13:50,581 --> 01:13:52,950
It's not even like physically possible
to build,

1683
01:13:52,951 --> 01:13:56,010
cause we'd have to go through all these
like rivers and take over people's land

1684
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:58,950
and his like,
how did we get presidential candidates

1685
01:13:58,951 --> 01:14:01,260
who,
not that they're stupid,

1686
01:14:01,261 --> 01:14:03,340
not they're crazy,
but who like fundamentally denied

1687
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,710
physical reality.
Like this is what,

1688
01:14:04,711 --> 01:14:06,410
this is where we are right now.
We,

1689
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:07,140
yeah,
I don't think he

1690
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,990
necessarily as a presidential candidate,
I don't buy it.

1691
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,400
You think you think it's to the other
ones look moderate

1692
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,400
and reasonable?
No,

1693
01:14:13,401 --> 01:14:14,181
I don't think it's,
um,

1694
01:14:14,181 --> 01:14:18,800
some grand conspiracy.
I think it's him riding this crazy wave

1695
01:14:18,801 --> 01:14:23,600
of attention and trying to think in his
own mind that it's justified because

1696
01:14:23,601 --> 01:14:27,770
he's shining light on these important
issues in a way that only he can because

1697
01:14:27,771 --> 01:14:30,410
he's independently wealthy and he's not
bound to,

1698
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:31,401
you know,
the,

1699
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:32,280
um,
the,

1700
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:33,800
the,
the wishes of his constituents.

1701
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:35,150
He can just kind of go out there and
say,

1702
01:14:35,151 --> 01:14:39,260
I want to put a giant wall up and call
it the trump wall and then we're going

1703
01:14:39,261 --> 01:14:41,820
to keep off the Mexicans.
Yeah.

1704
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:44,460
And meanwhile,
everybody wants to fucking kill him and

1705
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:46,820
in his face as fallen off his bones.
It's just,

1706
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:51,020
it's so bizarre.
It's so cohen brothers ask that like,

1707
01:14:51,021 --> 01:14:54,290
he really does seem like satire.
I mean,

1708
01:14:54,291 --> 01:14:59,240
he's like the ultimate American satire
president candidate.

1709
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:01,360
Did you ever interview him like back
before,

1710
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:01,550
right?

1711
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:02,450
No,
no,

1712
01:15:02,451 --> 01:15:03,650
I've never met him.
Nothing.

1713
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:04,621
I,
uh,

1714
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:06,000
I,
once I confronted him at a press

1715
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:08,910
conference in Dubai,
it's like one of my finest moments.

1716
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:12,090
I know.
I was really scared because Dubai is a,

1717
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:13,020
it's please state,
you know,

1718
01:15:13,021 --> 01:15:14,130
there's no free speech there.
It's real,

1719
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:15,130
real,
you know,

1720
01:15:15,150 --> 01:15:17,250
they'll lock you up and they're rich
enough.

1721
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:19,440
They don't really care about your
American passport that much.

1722
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,860
And so as that,
this press conference where he had these

1723
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,890
golf courses that he was licensing his
name too,

1724
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:31,380
and I had some Intel that the guys that
were building the golf courses were

1725
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:33,580
getting 200 bucks a month to do
construction work.

1726
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:37,120
And like the Emirates,
the average salary of an Mrr adi is,

1727
01:15:37,121 --> 01:15:40,180
I think it's like sixty thousand sixty
thousand a year I think.

1728
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:42,310
And he's gets 200 a month,
you know,

1729
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:45,910
to do like hard ass construction work.
And so I get up during the press

1730
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:48,700
conference where he's getting his ass
kissed and I'm waving my hand around and

1731
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:50,770
I say,
you know Mr. Trump,

1732
01:15:50,771 --> 01:15:55,771
you've been saying how you know this all
stands for luxury and your construction

1733
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:58,540
guys are getting $200 a month.
Are You satisfied with that?

1734
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,560
And his mouth fucking shriveled.
I've never seen it like shriveled,

1735
01:16:01,610 --> 01:16:05,170
this little tiny Rosebud at hate.
And I got so yelled at,

1736
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:07,750
but he yelled at you.
He didn't yell at me that the,

1737
01:16:07,751 --> 01:16:11,170
the underling yelled at me.
He's under the underlying from the MRI

1738
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:13,090
pr firm that was there.
What did they say?

1739
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,910
That's not an appropriate question.
How's that?

1740
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:17,140
Not Appropriate.
I know.

1741
01:16:17,141 --> 01:16:19,360
And then the next question was,
Mr. Trump,

1742
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:21,700
you stand for luxury in Dubai stands for
luxury.

1743
01:16:21,701 --> 01:16:25,270
Is that why you do buy like each other?
Some tough,

1744
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:27,130
tough stuff.
So did he answer you?

1745
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:27,791
No,
he didn't.

1746
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,760
He didn't answer me.
He just like mouth trivial and like

1747
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:33,820
Ivanka his mouth when all small like
everyone's mouth went really small with

1748
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:34,540
anger.

1749
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:36,130
Cos this is a long time ago,
right?

1750
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,380
Is that the drawing?

1751
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:37,921
Yeah.
Yeah,

1752
01:16:37,921 --> 01:16:38,980
that's the drawing and man,
ah,

1753
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,520
ah,
he was so angry at me cause I,

1754
01:16:41,521 --> 01:16:44,190
cause I took like a little startup to
just picture of him.

1755
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:45,420
But yeah,
he was like,

1756
01:16:45,421 --> 01:16:49,100
they're talking about how New York
should be more like Dubai because in

1757
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,700
Dubai everything was perfect.
Yeah.

1758
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:52,320
Yeah.
He,

1759
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,570
he liked the ass kissing.
He said that he built the greatest

1760
01:16:54,571 --> 01:16:57,090
architectural buildings in New York.
I beg to differ.

1761
01:16:58,350 --> 01:16:58,660
Yeah.

1762
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,980
Wow.
He really said that.

1763
01:16:59,981 --> 01:17:02,770
You know,
my friend Joey Diaz grew up in New York

1764
01:17:02,771 --> 01:17:04,420
and he said,
one of the things that people forget

1765
01:17:04,421 --> 01:17:08,320
about Donald Trump is all the disputes
that he had with small local

1766
01:17:08,321 --> 01:17:11,660
construction that used,
they use for projects.

1767
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:14,630
And now these people like wound up going
out of business and they,

1768
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:15,380
you know,
they couldn't,

1769
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:18,100
they couldn't battle him financially.
And like,

1770
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:22,840
he's like this wave of people that hate
him in that whole construction business.

1771
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:26,240
I don't know who's right and who's wrong
about those disputes,

1772
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:29,390
but the idea that you could take that
model,

1773
01:17:29,391 --> 01:17:34,220
which is already problematic in America
and then take it and wrap it up in a

1774
01:17:34,221 --> 01:17:39,221
giant way and do buy that fucking piece
that vice did on those people that are

1775
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:44,720
in Dubai that are trapped where they
take their passports.

1776
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:46,790
I think that,
I think I did a big piece on that.

1777
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,230
Did you?
Yeah,

1778
01:17:48,231 --> 01:17:49,170
there was a,
um,

1779
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,080
um,
how long ago was your amendment?

1780
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:53,090
No,
this was a few years ago.

1781
01:17:53,091 --> 01:17:56,120
Like maybe six or seven years ago.
There was a,

1782
01:17:56,121 --> 01:17:58,460
um,
a camp that they went to and these men

1783
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:00,530
were crow,
just openly weeping.

1784
01:18:00,531 --> 01:18:03,260
There was showing this like hole in the
ground where they have to shit.

1785
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:07,760
And they were showing how poor the water
is and they had promised them a

1786
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:11,840
substantial amount of money per month
and they were coming over from India and

1787
01:18:11,841 --> 01:18:13,850
the Philippines,
a lot of third world countries.

1788
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:18,230
And once they got there they would take
their passports away and then reduce

1789
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:20,770
their salary traumatically,
you know,

1790
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:25,010
and they couldn't leave and they were
forcing them to build these structures.

1791
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:25,850
Exactly.
Yeah.

1792
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,640
It's totally like that.
And then the other really fucked up

1793
01:18:28,641 --> 01:18:32,150
thing is that like these guys,
they're not passive.

1794
01:18:32,151 --> 01:18:34,640
Like they try to strike and stuff,
especially very often.

1795
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,100
Not only do they reduce their salaries,
they just don't pay him.

1796
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:38,840
Like,
and can you imagine like you've like a

1797
01:18:38,841 --> 01:18:40,190
wife and kids at home,
you know,

1798
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:42,860
who are like depending on you to like go
to another country and you know,

1799
01:18:42,861 --> 01:18:44,390
make,
make money for the family and then you

1800
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:45,830
just don't get paid for three months.
Like,

1801
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,030
it's like,
you know,

1802
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:49,790
breaking a whole family.
And so these guys will do strikes,

1803
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,430
they'll do sit downs in front of the
buses and then they hold them off to

1804
01:18:52,431 --> 01:18:54,600
jail and deport them when they do that.
And it's,

1805
01:18:54,601 --> 01:18:56,840
it's scary.
It's so scary that it's again,

1806
01:18:56,841 --> 01:18:59,600
what we're talking about,
the spectrum of human behavior that,

1807
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:03,170
I mean it's like a few steps away from
being a serial killer,

1808
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:08,171
but it's just this s s sort of
pathological detachment from compassion.

1809
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,630
You know,
that you don't,

1810
01:19:11,631 --> 01:19:14,960
you don't care about these people that
are risking their lives to make these

1811
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:18,320
giant buildings that are,
these royal people are gonna walk on

1812
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:22,730
roses and they throw at their feet and
step into these things and go skiing in

1813
01:19:22,731 --> 01:19:23,450
the middle of summer.

1814
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:27,380
And these gigantic buildings they make,
they make these crazy fucking structures

1815
01:19:27,381 --> 01:19:30,470
over there cause they,
they almost have an unlimited budget.

1816
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:33,350
It's almost like they have like an idea
in their head,

1817
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:36,710
you know,
I would like to fly in doors and they're

1818
01:19:36,711 --> 01:19:37,700
like,
okay,

1819
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:41,930
we're going to build you a mile high
fucking gigantic building where you

1820
01:19:41,931 --> 01:19:44,300
could fly inside.
And you know,

1821
01:19:44,301 --> 01:19:47,150
and then you have planes that you could
fly indoors.

1822
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:50,690
Like I shouldn't even have said that
because someone in Dubai is probably

1823
01:19:50,691 --> 01:19:55,691
listening and a light bulb went off in
their head yes and indoor flight course.

1824
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:02,030
And it's what's so strange is like I was
prepared to like hate Dubai.

1825
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,250
How Dubai look like.
I hate how Dubai is,

1826
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:08,250
but I mean I was prepared to like
aesthetically hated as well as ethically

1827
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,260
hated.
But what's weird is when you go there,

1828
01:20:10,261 --> 01:20:11,430
it's beautiful.
That's the thing.

1829
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,680
It's like,
I remember I was looking at that

1830
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:15,030
building like the Shard,
you know the worlds,

1831
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:18,240
the worlds tallest building Alberg did
you go in it?

1832
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:19,920
Um,
I went down to the ground floor and I

1833
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:23,610
bought a $20 cup of coffee.
$20 is $20.

1834
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,820
Oh my God.
How it taste like a fucking cup of iced

1835
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:28,420
coffee.
We have a day.

1836
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:31,020
Was that was just sort of a bevel an
object.

1837
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:35,580
But so I was like going into,
I was going into it like prepared to

1838
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,230
like really like aesthetically judge it
too.

1839
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:39,210
And like the thing is it's like so
beautiful.

1840
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:43,560
And then I was remembering,
I was like for cy is also beautiful and

1841
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:46,980
look at how that was made and it was
this weird thing cause you,

1842
01:20:46,981 --> 01:20:50,640
you think about how splendors always
made and how like the most beautiful

1843
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:51,770
things in the world,
you know,

1844
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:54,810
always are constructed and you
definitely go there and you're like,

1845
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:58,800
this is the city of the future and this
is the new aristocrats and this is

1846
01:20:58,801 --> 01:21:03,240
beautiful and it's all being built by
slaves who are dying to build it.

1847
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,750
Well I dunno if it's the future with
stuff in the future of that area,

1848
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:11,780
but they just have this strange world
where it was incredibly poor up until

1849
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:16,821
just a few decades ago and then all of a
sudden they start pumping oil out of

1850
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:23,001
that place and the money is astronomical
and the change in the amount of money

1851
01:21:24,931 --> 01:21:27,720
that area has,
the few that have it,

1852
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:28,640
the,
the,

1853
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:30,900
the,
the disparity of wealth is just

1854
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,400
unimaginable.

1855
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:35,810
One of the kinds of interesting things
that they did in Abu Dhabi,

1856
01:21:35,811 --> 01:21:38,150
which actually I kind of,
I admire it,

1857
01:21:38,151 --> 01:21:41,000
is that in a lot of countries when they
get oil money,

1858
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,380
like someone steals it,
you know,

1859
01:21:42,381 --> 01:21:45,170
up top.
But in Abu Dhabi what they did was they

1860
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:49,160
gave citizens a lot of entitlements to
stuff.

1861
01:21:49,161 --> 01:21:51,020
Like you get free education.
If you're in a Morati,

1862
01:21:51,021 --> 01:21:54,110
you get a free healthcare housing,
get a stipend,

1863
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,940
a Mrit.
Women are like super,

1864
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:57,020
super educated.
Most,

1865
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:59,420
uh,
most of the phds are Mrid women.

1866
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,770
So like,
that's awesome.

1867
01:22:00,771 --> 01:22:03,590
But the thing is,
the flip side of that is like citizens

1868
01:22:03,591 --> 01:22:05,950
are only 10% of the population and it's
like 90,

1869
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:09,080
90% of the people,
the people who do everything,

1870
01:22:09,081 --> 01:22:10,340
like the engineers,
the shop,

1871
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:11,900
the shop workers,
the maids,

1872
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:12,820
the,
um,

1873
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:15,020
you know,
construction dudes like the people who

1874
01:22:15,021 --> 01:22:18,170
do every manner of work are not citizens
and have no rights to anything.

1875
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,243
Wow.

1876
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:21,540
That's a trip.
We're,

1877
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,680
you know,
we're looking on the outside at that

1878
01:22:24,681 --> 01:22:25,760
place.
I mean,

1879
01:22:25,761 --> 01:22:26,240
I,
I've,

1880
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:29,630
I've talked to people that I've been,
I've been to Dubai and I've been to Abu

1881
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:31,850
Dhabi,
I was there for a UFC event.

1882
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:33,830
And uh,
you know,

1883
01:22:33,831 --> 01:22:36,500
without getting into anything political,
it's beautiful,

1884
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:37,101
you know,
and you're like,

1885
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:37,731
wow,
these are,

1886
01:22:37,731 --> 01:22:40,070
these people have done a great job and
constructing these things.

1887
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:44,080
But the guy,
the guys that I was with,

1888
01:22:44,081 --> 01:22:45,950
um,
some of them went to,

1889
01:22:46,010 --> 01:22:49,040
uh,
they went to Dubai because we have the

1890
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,350
night off and I was tired so I to stay
home,

1891
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,610
if they went to Dubai,
the guy,

1892
01:22:52,611 --> 01:22:54,360
we're going to go to a bar.
And you know how it just,

1893
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:57,280
some places you can go to drink,
like you have to drink in certain play

1894
01:22:57,281 --> 01:23:01,130
because it's illegal to have alcohol,
but there's some sort of weird loophole

1895
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,490
and they said it was all Russian
prostitutes.

1896
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:09,820
They said it was just like these
predatory coyote women that had crossed

1897
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:13,450
over.
I would just like looking to dig just a

1898
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:16,780
pocket cash from banging all these rich
dudes.

1899
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:17,801
And I was like,
whoa.

1900
01:23:17,801 --> 01:23:18,281
Like I,
the,

1901
01:23:18,281 --> 01:23:20,740
my friend went to a bar and he said,
I'm not bullshitting.

1902
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,220
This bar might've been 80% hookers and I
go,

1903
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:24,841
that might,
he goes,

1904
01:23:24,841 --> 01:23:26,170
I never seen anything like it in my
life.

1905
01:23:26,630 --> 01:23:27,870
Yeah.
Women go over there to like,

1906
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:30,850
it's make to make some serious money.
Bet You can.

1907
01:23:30,851 --> 01:23:35,020
I bet you can fucking clean it up.
But it's probably really dangerous too,

1908
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:36,290
right.
You know,

1909
01:23:36,310 --> 01:23:38,410
I never did.
I never really did research on like sex

1910
01:23:38,411 --> 01:23:39,820
work in Dubai.
Like my,

1911
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:41,800
and I'm like,
I'll be like,

1912
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:45,580
I know mostly about construction work in
something about the maids and not so

1913
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:47,770
much,
but I think for anyone who's not a

1914
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:50,380
citizen,
it's dangerous because you like don't

1915
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:52,330
have any real rights if you're not a
citizen.

1916
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:53,051
Yeah.
I remember,

1917
01:23:53,051 --> 01:23:56,530
I think it was a British couple that
were making out on the beach and they

1918
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:58,420
were arrested.
They were just kissing.

1919
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,790
They were just,
but they were openly showing affection

1920
01:24:00,791 --> 01:24:02,650
on the beach and they were thrown in
jail.

1921
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:03,850
I'm like,
whoa.

1922
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:05,080
Wow.
This is another one.

1923
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:08,230
This is the craziest one.
There was a British man who,

1924
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:13,290
um,
he had eaten a poppy seed Bagel and

1925
01:24:14,891 --> 01:24:19,390
poppy seeds will,
you will test positive for heroin if you

1926
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:20,890
eat,
like it's trace amounts,

1927
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:24,340
but obviously it's not enough to be
psychoactive,

1928
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:27,790
but it's enough to show up in a really
comprehensive blood examination.

1929
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:32,830
So they tested this guy and uh,
he tested positive for heroin and they

1930
01:24:32,831 --> 01:24:35,560
put him in a fucking cell.
They're like,

1931
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:40,030
he had a poppy seed Bagel at Heathrow
airport and that big old got him locked

1932
01:24:40,031 --> 01:24:41,470
up in a jail cell.

1933
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,900
Like,
whoa.

1934
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:47,380
There's another woman who was an
executive at Brillstein Gray,

1935
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:52,120
which is a very prominent Los Angeles
Entertainment Group.

1936
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:53,010
And,
uh,

1937
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:55,000
she had,
um,

1938
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,530
what does that shit that people take?
It's a,

1939
01:24:56,531 --> 01:24:58,000
it's a natural thing.
Oh,

1940
01:24:58,001 --> 01:24:59,830
I'm you take it when you want to go to
bed.

1941
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:01,440
Uh,
no,

1942
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:01,821
no,
no,

1943
01:25:01,821 --> 01:25:02,051
no,
no.

1944
01:25:02,051 --> 01:25:06,760
It wasn't that it was a Melatonin.
Should Melatonin fucking Melatonin.

1945
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:08,740
Yes.
You can't have Melatonin.

1946
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:10,870
They arrested her,
locked her up,

1947
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:13,780
took her passport,
put her in a jail cell for fucking

1948
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:17,860
Melatonin and then you know,
somehow or another somehow got word of

1949
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:22,000
it and they got her out eventually.
But what a terrifying moment it must

1950
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:23,920
have been for her.
There was another guy who had a

1951
01:25:23,921 --> 01:25:28,240
marijuana seed like,
or a stem or a piece of marijuana that

1952
01:25:28,241 --> 01:25:32,020
was wedged in between the tread of his
shoes.

1953
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,080
That was it.
And that was enough to put him in jail

1954
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:38,650
and he was going to be sentenced for
some fucking astronomical amount of

1955
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:39,070
time.

1956
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:40,600
And I don't know what happened to that
poor guy,

1957
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:45,840
but unfortunately for him,
he was a black guy with dreadlocks from

1958
01:25:46,061 --> 01:25:48,150
England and they were like,
ah,

1959
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:52,330
dude.
Forever cage forever.

1960
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,260
Yeah,
it's a really,

1961
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:54,700
really,
really racist.

1962
01:25:54,701 --> 01:25:56,140
Some of them are here.
We'll go right here.

1963
01:25:56,141 --> 01:25:59,680
Some of the horror stories would be
reported by the BBC four year jail term

1964
01:25:59,681 --> 01:26:04,681
for possession of 0.003 grams of
cannabis stuck to the bottom of his

1965
01:26:05,451 --> 01:26:07,430
shoe.
That's the guy that's Keith Brown.

1966
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:13,150
Robert Dalton on trial for alleged
possession of 0.3 grams of cannabis,

1967
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:18,940
0.03 unnamed 20 year old on trial for
allegedly zaw cannabis.

1968
01:26:19,071 --> 01:26:19,904
Mostly.

1969
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:21,820
I had this one dude I met there,
he's,

1970
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,430
he's on the rowdy and he was really
interesting.

1971
01:26:24,431 --> 01:26:29,431
His name is Allen Edmonds store and he,
I mean like he's so brave,

1972
01:26:30,581 --> 01:26:31,780
right.
Cause you have so many privileges like

1973
01:26:31,781 --> 01:26:34,300
as an Mri especially came from like a
good family and everything,

1974
01:26:34,301 --> 01:26:36,130
you know,
you can really just coast it if you're

1975
01:26:36,131 --> 01:26:37,360
Mrd and your,
you know,

1976
01:26:37,361 --> 01:26:41,350
from a well off family.
And he made a web forum that let people

1977
01:26:41,351 --> 01:26:43,420
um,
discuss,

1978
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:45,430
uh,
basically discuss the royal family

1979
01:26:45,431 --> 01:26:46,600
frankly.
And it also,

1980
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:48,400
it let people discuss religion kind of
frankly.

1981
01:26:48,401 --> 01:26:50,650
And if you were an atheist,
you can talk about it on the web forum

1982
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:55,090
and they fucking,
they locked him up for was hinge Elford

1983
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:58,930
I have to have to check this but I want
to say was around nine months and then

1984
01:26:58,931 --> 01:27:02,470
factored in with scabies when he was in
jail and then when they let him out

1985
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,000
affected and purposely,
yeah,

1986
01:27:04,001 --> 01:27:05,650
that's what he said.
He said that they like gave him a

1987
01:27:05,651 --> 01:27:06,910
blanket that had scabies on it.

1988
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:13,350
And then when he was out the,
he had the series of unfortunate events

1989
01:27:13,391 --> 01:27:17,830
that happened up over $100,000
accidentally disappeared from his bank

1990
01:27:17,831 --> 01:27:20,230
account and no one knows how it got,
how I got missing.

1991
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,520
And then like on two occasions at guys
just sort of jumped out and beat the

1992
01:27:24,521 --> 01:27:26,290
shit out of him and no one knows who
they were.

1993
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:28,750
You know,
it's a mystery and his car just gets

1994
01:27:28,751 --> 01:27:31,720
stolen all the time.
And the tires keep getting error taken

1995
01:27:31,721 --> 01:27:32,554
out of it.
And you know,

1996
01:27:33,010 --> 01:27:35,020
magical mystery.
No one knows who's behind that.

1997
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:35,800
Uh Huh.

1998
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,800
Fuck yeah.
Could you imagine if you like pissed off

1999
01:27:38,801 --> 01:27:42,490
some royal family and they just hired
some dude and they pay him and your job

2000
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:45,610
is to fuck with this guy forever.
Like that's it.

2001
01:27:45,611 --> 01:27:47,170
That's your job.
Or you know,

2002
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:51,160
if you're like some sort of a rich
billionaire character,

2003
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:54,040
you could hire a bunch of people and you
could have a whole team,

2004
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:55,151
you know,
and their,

2005
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,970
their jobs just to fuck with people.
There's this one guy,

2006
01:27:58,060 --> 01:27:59,530
I don't like them.
Let's go get them.

2007
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,780
I mean,
that wouldn't be hard.

2008
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:05,530
Like if you're like some trump guy and
you've got billions of dollars and

2009
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:08,710
someone like molly crab,
apple makes you feel like shit at some

2010
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,260
Dubai press event and you're like,
fuck this bitch.

2011
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:14,020
This is what we're going to do.
I'm going to hire a team and I'm going

2012
01:28:14,021 --> 01:28:17,620
to fuck with molly crab apples life.
I mean that's a reality.

2013
01:28:17,621 --> 01:28:20,020
Like someone who's not wealthy,
they could do something like that.

2014
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,670
That's scary shit.
Yeah,

2015
01:28:21,671 --> 01:28:22,720
they definitely,
they definitely,

2016
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,610
they definitely could know they could
hire somebody.

2017
01:28:24,611 --> 01:28:26,680
Just every time he got to your car,
your tires are flat.

2018
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:29,860
Like what the fuck?
Tacos.

2019
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:32,440
At a certain point though,
you'd probably put up like a little cam

2020
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:35,350
on your car and you know,
or you'd hire some people to,

2021
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,060
yeah,
exactly.

2022
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,550
It'd be like war of the proxies,
war

2023
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:39,920
proxies.
That's it,

2024
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:41,390
right?
Yeah.

2025
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,560
I don't know what,
or have you gone to any places that were

2026
01:28:45,561 --> 01:28:48,540
positive in your journalism escapades?

2027
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:51,350
I love Istanbul.
Istanbul is like one of my favorite

2028
01:28:51,351 --> 01:28:54,140
cities ever.
It's just so gorgeous.

2029
01:28:54,141 --> 01:28:57,170
And it's so exciting.
And you walked down like Easter collage

2030
01:28:57,171 --> 01:28:57,650
I,
Jesse,

2031
01:28:57,650 --> 01:28:58,550
which is,
um,

2032
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,550
sort of the main street in a
neighborhood called Bay Olu and it's

2033
01:29:02,551 --> 01:29:04,170
like,
there's like lights and all these

2034
01:29:04,171 --> 01:29:06,360
couples hand in hand and everyone's
playing music.

2035
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:09,510
There's like kids selling flower crowns.
It's just like,

2036
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:12,960
it feels like the sort of boulevard that
every other boulevard in the world is

2037
01:29:12,961 --> 01:29:15,000
trying to be.
It's so magic.

2038
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:16,620
And I mean,
I could,

2039
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:22,200
I could just walk around Istanbul like
anytime of day or night and I would

2040
01:29:22,201 --> 01:29:24,420
never not like have my heartbeat faster
that city.

2041
01:29:24,630 --> 01:29:26,430
Wow.
So that's your favorite spot?

2042
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:28,490
That's my favorite spot.
You'd ever be an ex.

2043
01:29:28,491 --> 01:29:31,520
Pat moved to Istanbul and they're
arresting a lot of that.

2044
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:33,960
They have a bad record unfortunately for
arresting journalists.

2045
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:34,980
They are one of the,
uh,

2046
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:36,840
one of my colleagues.
Yeah.

2047
01:29:36,841 --> 01:29:38,160
One of my colleagues' advice,
uh,

2048
01:29:38,161 --> 01:29:39,900
this,
um,

2049
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,070
brilliant,
uh,

2050
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,680
Kurdish dude,
um,

2051
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:47,370
Mohammed Rasulullah,
he is like currently in jail right now

2052
01:29:47,371 --> 01:29:49,220
for doing journalism and Turkey and
vices.

2053
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:50,910
Like you're trying really hard to get
him out,

2054
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:55,911
but he is like rotting in a jail cell
and they claim that he is isis because

2055
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,860
he used it in cryption.
He is a Kurdish dude.

2056
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:01,890
He's a Kurdish dude that like covers all
of the anti isis stuff.

2057
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:02,910
He's not,
he's not isis.

2058
01:30:02,911 --> 01:30:05,940
This is so embarrassing and a name and
yeah,

2059
01:30:05,941 --> 01:30:07,560
he's,
he's routing in a jail cell there.

2060
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,450
How long has he been there?
Oh God,

2061
01:30:09,451 --> 01:30:12,510
it's over.
I think it's going to be going on three

2062
01:30:12,511 --> 01:30:13,450
months now.
And they,

2063
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,000
I don't think they've even really
charged them yet.

2064
01:30:15,001 --> 01:30:16,560
They're just like leaked statements to
the press.

2065
01:30:16,980 --> 01:30:19,080
Wow.
But,

2066
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:19,820
um,
that,

2067
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:20,920
that aside,
I,

2068
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:22,061
you know,
the,

2069
01:30:22,061 --> 01:30:25,020
the political repression aside,
I really do find it assembled,

2070
01:30:25,021 --> 01:30:28,590
be marvelous city.
No place is perfect.

2071
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,040
They charged him with,
so what is his actual w what is their

2072
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:34,020
grievance with them?
What does the actual issue,

2073
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:37,680
he was going with these two British vice
journalists and they were covering a

2074
01:30:37,681 --> 01:30:42,681
clashes between the Turkish government
and Kurds in the south and they pick

2075
01:30:42,901 --> 01:30:45,480
them up doing that.
So they just decided they didn't like

2076
01:30:45,481 --> 01:30:47,420
him.
[inaudible] he's doing Carl's in

2077
01:30:47,421 --> 01:30:48,260
trouble.
Well they,

2078
01:30:48,261 --> 01:30:52,410
they've been actually like deporting and
fucking with a lot of journalists who

2079
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:54,570
have been doing this.
But I think,

2080
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:57,450
I think it's like they,
the two British guys got out cause you

2081
01:30:57,451 --> 01:31:00,480
know they're British.
Whereas if you're in a rocky Kurd like

2082
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:01,500
no,
but who's going to,

2083
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,840
who's going to be the person putting
pressure on Turkey for you?

2084
01:31:04,360 --> 01:31:07,740
I'm sure you're aware of that Saudi
Arabian blogger that's been beaten

2085
01:31:07,741 --> 01:31:09,840
repeatedly there.
Yeah.

2086
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:12,300
So that's,
that's a fucking horrible story too.

2087
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:14,750
That's one of the weirdest aspects of
the United States.

2088
01:31:14,940 --> 01:31:18,390
A relationship with Saudi Arabia.
It's like we'll talk about all the

2089
01:31:18,391 --> 01:31:20,610
atrocities that are committed by all
these different countries,

2090
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:25,611
but Saudi Arabia is
moderate and meanwhile they like sent,

2091
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:29,100
they sentenced a poet to death for
poetry in Saudi recently.

2092
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:33,200
How bad was the poetry though?
Was it like def jam slam comedy in the

2093
01:31:33,201 --> 01:31:34,040
little things?
All right.

2094
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:35,210
Why are you poetry shaming?
Why are you,

2095
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:37,400
why are you have what you have to free
verse shame right now,

2096
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:41,120
you know?
No,

2097
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:43,340
it's a phrase in reverse.
When you make culture that doesn't like

2098
01:31:43,341 --> 01:31:44,900
Reimer or how did he meet her or
anything?

2099
01:31:45,670 --> 01:31:46,820
No,
Haikus a short one.

2100
01:31:46,821 --> 01:31:48,590
Right.
I'm not much into poetry,

2101
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,270
but I remember I,
I've gone to,

2102
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:54,800
I went to a poetry slam in Venice once,
which is the perfect place to go because

2103
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,990
people take themselves so fucking
seriously.

2104
01:31:57,350 --> 01:32:00,400
And that was with a buddy of mine and we
were a high

2105
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,000
as you should ever be,
what you were in public walking around

2106
01:32:04,001 --> 01:32:06,790
talking to people like barely aware of
reality.

2107
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:10,710
And we walked by this place and it was a
poetry slam and we ha,

2108
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:12,130
I'm like,
we have to go inside.

2109
01:32:12,131 --> 01:32:15,010
We have to go inside.
And we went inside and we were both like

2110
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:17,620
biting her hands.
Try not to laugh because it was just so

2111
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:20,140
for po preposterous,
just so you know,

2112
01:32:20,141 --> 01:32:25,141
that really just pretentious save the
world type

2113
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:27,303
true.

2114
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:29,840
20 year old white guys with dreadlocks.

2115
01:32:30,060 --> 01:32:30,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

2116
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:31,803
I,
I,

2117
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,230
I do.
I mean,

2118
01:32:34,370 --> 01:32:38,700
I think as a visual artist I have a
similar thing when I see like really,

2119
01:32:38,701 --> 01:32:42,930
really bad art work and I'm just like,
not only are you shaming yourself,

2120
01:32:42,931 --> 01:32:44,660
you're shaming my whole profession here.

2121
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:47,390
Yeah.
But you know what I also like as I've

2122
01:32:47,391 --> 01:32:52,391
gotten older and I've sort of understand
the nuance of life,

2123
01:32:52,401 --> 01:32:55,070
like what this guy's doing,
this is stupid shame,

2124
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:57,320
shamp slam,
whatever poetry.

2125
01:32:57,740 --> 01:33:00,710
What he really is doing is she's trying
to express himself and he's developing

2126
01:33:00,711 --> 01:33:03,350
as a person and right now it's kind of
ridiculous to other people that are

2127
01:33:03,351 --> 01:33:08,060
maybe a little bit more well versed in
the ways of the world and with a more

2128
01:33:08,061 --> 01:33:10,040
social experience.
What he's trying to do is like,

2129
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:14,210
he sees the world is wrong and he wants
to get Social Brownie points by pointing

2130
01:33:14,211 --> 01:33:17,210
it out and you know,
and people clap and cheer and he's so,

2131
01:33:17,211 --> 01:33:22,211
he sat down this loose leaf binder and
wrote all this stuff out and he's just

2132
01:33:22,581 --> 01:33:25,520
feels like he's really good.
And one day he'll look back at that and

2133
01:33:25,521 --> 01:33:26,840
go,
what a fucking moron.

2134
01:33:26,841 --> 01:33:28,430
I was just like,
I'll look back at,

2135
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:33,730
I have a comedy notebook from 1990 and I
should probably burn it in case someone

2136
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:35,420
breaks in my house and finds it.

2137
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:38,770
Dude.
Like if you die then someone will

2138
01:33:39,130 --> 01:33:42,100
publish the collected papers of Joe
Rogan and this will be your most famous

2139
01:33:42,101 --> 01:33:42,934
thing,

2140
01:33:43,220 --> 01:33:46,220
a bit in there about wonder woman,
like trying to explain wonder woman.

2141
01:33:46,221 --> 01:33:48,560
It's so bad,
but I was,

2142
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:50,780
you know,
21 years old or whatever the fuck I was

2143
01:33:50,781 --> 01:33:51,650
at the time.
It's like,

2144
01:33:52,250 --> 01:33:53,620
it's just,
that's what you're,

2145
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:55,740
you're when you suck then one of your
yacht,

2146
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,890
I mean it takes a while to get good at
anything.

2147
01:33:58,050 --> 01:34:00,770
Many years I,
sometimes I look back at my old drawings

2148
01:34:00,771 --> 01:34:03,470
and I'm like,
how did I ever get hired as an artist?

2149
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:07,340
What delusional process did I ever think
that I'd be an artist putting these

2150
01:34:07,341 --> 01:34:10,550
things out there and again and again and
again in the face of very deserted

2151
01:34:10,551 --> 01:34:13,910
projection for many years.
But it worked out right?

2152
01:34:13,911 --> 01:34:18,680
Because like if you just keep chipping
away at it and eventually eventually get

2153
01:34:18,681 --> 01:34:19,550
through.
And I really,

2154
01:34:19,551 --> 01:34:22,100
I tried to actually really write about
that in my book because I feel like

2155
01:34:22,101 --> 01:34:25,160
sometimes a lot of artists they front
and they act like,

2156
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:26,570
oh,
I was just really good from the start

2157
01:34:26,571 --> 01:34:28,280
and then it was really easy and I was
like,

2158
01:34:28,281 --> 01:34:29,690
no,
I sucked from the start.

2159
01:34:29,691 --> 01:34:30,524
And it was really hard.

2160
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,680
Yeah.
Most comedians will tell you that they

2161
01:34:33,681 --> 01:34:36,230
suck from the start except the ones that
are aren't that good,

2162
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:39,710
which will claim that they were always
awesome was the ones,

2163
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:42,140
I think all my friends that are,
that are really good,

2164
01:34:42,141 --> 01:34:44,120
they'll all tell you they're fucking
newer were terrible.

2165
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:46,970
I have um,
two young daughters and one of the cool

2166
01:34:46,971 --> 01:34:49,430
things is watching their art.
Like they're really in the art,

2167
01:34:49,431 --> 01:34:51,260
especially my seven year old is really
into it.

2168
01:34:51,261 --> 01:34:52,790
She draws every day.
It's so cool.

2169
01:34:52,850 --> 01:34:53,690
And,
um,

2170
01:34:53,750 --> 01:34:57,740
W W I watch her early stuff like I save
all our and,

2171
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,620
or at least representations like,
you know,

2172
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:05,621
like some of it and watching like there
early like control of her motor skills

2173
01:35:07,281 --> 01:35:10,520
in our hands from the time she was like
three to four years later.

2174
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:13,480
This just dramatic difference in what
she's ability,

2175
01:35:13,481 --> 01:35:16,230
you know,
her ability to draw things and draw

2176
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:20,390
representations and figure out like
perspective and sizes.

2177
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:22,970
And we were going through this book
yesterday,

2178
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:27,410
she has this um,
how to draw a figures book and it was

2179
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:31,490
the weirdest fucking thing because um,
it was these princesses,

2180
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:34,400
it's just trying to draw princesses and
um,

2181
01:35:34,590 --> 01:35:36,980
I'm,
I'm looking at the book and we're going

2182
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,800
through it together and you know,
it's like one of those books where you

2183
01:35:39,801 --> 01:35:41,510
have a framework,
you know,

2184
01:35:41,511 --> 01:35:45,680
like there's like balls and sticks and
you try to like make the framework and

2185
01:35:45,681 --> 01:35:48,430
then you had the close to the framework
and totally.

2186
01:35:48,570 --> 01:35:53,570
But the women's legs were like more than
twice as long as they should have been.

2187
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,760
When you're trying to do those like
fashiony cartoon drawings,

2188
01:35:58,761 --> 01:36:02,120
everyone is like so stretched out and
that's what's weird is that you get so

2189
01:36:02,121 --> 01:36:05,060
used to seeing that,
that when you see like cartoon people

2190
01:36:05,061 --> 01:36:06,590
done it,
they're real proportions.

2191
01:36:06,591 --> 01:36:08,930
They all look like weird and stubby.
Yeah.

2192
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:12,140
Well that's gotta be weird for it
because it doesn't seem that way for

2193
01:36:12,141 --> 01:36:14,030
men.
Like I was looking at the

2194
01:36:14,031 --> 01:36:16,730
representations of men,
they're fairly proportionate,

2195
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,200
but with,
with women,

2196
01:36:18,201 --> 01:36:22,760
it was all these insanely long legs and
insanely skinny bodies.

2197
01:36:22,761 --> 01:36:25,220
And I was like,
this is fucking strange.

2198
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:27,530
So much so that I had a pointed out to
her,

2199
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:28,790
you know,
she's like,

2200
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:29,510
uh,
you know,

2201
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:30,590
she's drawing it.
I go,

2202
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:32,570
well here's the deal.
You know,

2203
01:36:32,571 --> 01:36:33,710
I'm like,
this is,

2204
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,210
you can draw it like this.

2205
01:36:35,210 --> 01:36:37,520
One of the beautiful things about art is
you can do whatever you want.

2206
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:40,730
If you want to make people that have
giant hands that are size of those phone

2207
01:36:40,731 --> 01:36:42,590
number ones that people were at a
football game,

2208
01:36:42,591 --> 01:36:44,750
you could totally do that.
No one can stop you.

2209
01:36:44,751 --> 01:36:47,690
It's cause it's just drawing is your
expression.

2210
01:36:47,691 --> 01:36:50,030
Whatever you want to do,
but if you want to draw like a real

2211
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:51,980
person.
And so then we started,

2212
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:54,440
I started showing her like a real human
body.

2213
01:36:54,441 --> 01:36:54,861
I'm like,
okay,

2214
01:36:54,861 --> 01:36:56,870
I'm going to stand up and I'll stand up
next to the wall.

2215
01:36:56,871 --> 01:36:59,840
And what we're gonna do is we're going
to mark on the wall where the top of my

2216
01:36:59,841 --> 01:37:02,830
head is and where my waist is.
Awesome.

2217
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:07,220
And so we went from the top of my head
to the waist and then we went from the

2218
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:10,310
waist down to the feet and I said,
and you notice that like they're pretty

2219
01:37:10,311 --> 01:37:14,750
much the same or at least close,
but the women in these cartoon things

2220
01:37:14,751 --> 01:37:16,910
you're supposed to draw were no
bullshit.

2221
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:20,780
There was twice as much length in their
legs as there was from your waist up to

2222
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:22,160
their head.
And she was like,

2223
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:23,570
well why do they do that?
And I go,

2224
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:28,160
well thank some people think that it
looks better to make people that aren't

2225
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:30,890
real,
that that are like longer than reality,

2226
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:34,760
but like why do we accept that?
Because like if there was a woman and

2227
01:37:34,761 --> 01:37:37,910
that she had like,
like a normal proportion body but

2228
01:37:37,911 --> 01:37:41,030
enormous tits,
just freakish tits.

2229
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,620
Like everybody would look at that and
go,

2230
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:44,300
what the fuck are you making these kids
draw,

2231
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:46,160
you know?
But for,

2232
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:48,080
for whatever reason,
like having the,

2233
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:51,560
and by the way,
some people have freakish tits.

2234
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:53,970
There's,
there's people that for whatever reason

2235
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:56,040
there's that,
that poor dude who can't go

2236
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,920
to the airport without getting frisked
cause he has this giant Hog,

2237
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,900
has like some 20 inch Dick.
I was like,

2238
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,400
he's got the,
got the world's largest deck.

2239
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:05,070
And like they,
they always check his pants to think

2240
01:38:05,071 --> 01:38:08,160
he's carrying drugs or something.
Well there's women out there that are

2241
01:38:08,161 --> 01:38:10,830
just naturally born with enormous
breasts and there's nothing they could

2242
01:38:10,831 --> 01:38:13,860
do about it.
There's no one born with knowing that

2243
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:18,330
there's no one six feet tall and only
two feet of them are upper body and the

2244
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:19,200
rest of it,
his legs,

2245
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:21,360
that's just doesn't exist.
You know,

2246
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:22,500
it's,
it's crazy.

2247
01:38:22,501 --> 01:38:26,550
And even when I was at art school,
we would have a different formula for

2248
01:38:26,551 --> 01:38:31,030
drying figures and there was like they
would measure it and head.

2249
01:38:31,031 --> 01:38:35,290
So it's like this figure is nine heads
and a fashion figure.

2250
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:37,350
W W which what they called it,
which is,

2251
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:39,150
you know,
that take her for a fashion illustration

2252
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,940
was like so many more heads than like
any other figure.

2253
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,760
And so it was like that crazy along the
unaided thing and exactly what you're

2254
01:38:44,761 --> 01:38:46,740
saying with like the crazy daddy long
legs,

2255
01:38:46,741 --> 01:38:49,620
legs.
It's very strange because for men we,

2256
01:38:49,970 --> 01:38:53,970
I've never talked to a man who
understands that look because men are

2257
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:56,640
not attracted.
I mean I'm sure everybody varies,

2258
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:59,820
right?
But most men are not attractive to these

2259
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:03,590
stick figure people.
But women are expected to be stick

2260
01:39:03,591 --> 01:39:07,170
figure people to be models.
It's one of the weirdest things.

2261
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:10,050
And then women think that in order to be
attractive,

2262
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:13,410
they have to be like these media
representations of women.

2263
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:15,720
So they have to starve themselves.
And then men are like,

2264
01:39:15,721 --> 01:39:16,610
no,
don't do that.

2265
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:17,970
No one likes that.
But,

2266
01:39:17,971 --> 01:39:22,410
so like there's this weird disconnect
between what the opposite sex or,

2267
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:23,160
I mean,
I don't know,

2268
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,790
I can't speak for lesbians obviously,
but with the opposite sex finds

2269
01:39:26,791 --> 01:39:31,791
attractive and the representations of
attractive women like sucked in cheeks,

2270
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:35,880
ba basically like on death's door,
like,

2271
01:39:35,881 --> 01:39:37,080
yeah,
she's hot.

2272
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:38,041
Like,
no,

2273
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,000
that's weird.
It's,

2274
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:44,150
it's weird to see someone all cracked
out and skinny like that being the most

2275
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:47,720
with the most obvious representation of
like a,

2276
01:39:47,721 --> 01:39:50,490
a beautiful person in Nice clothes.
I mean,

2277
01:39:50,491 --> 01:39:51,810
I think it's,
you know,

2278
01:39:51,811 --> 01:39:54,210
fashion models aren't for men,
you know,

2279
01:39:54,211 --> 01:39:55,590
or they're not first,
they're not for straight men.

2280
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:58,200
They're supposed to appeal to women who
are buying the clothing.

2281
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,630
But do they even,
I don't,

2282
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,040
I mean,
I think,

2283
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:03,243
you know,
fashion,

2284
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:03,900
I think,
you know,

2285
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,250
women of all sizes,
skinny,

2286
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:05,821
skinny,
whatever.

2287
01:40:05,821 --> 01:40:09,660
I think I'll be super beautiful as long
as that's really you.

2288
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:11,460
Yeah.
As long as you're not harming yourself

2289
01:40:11,461 --> 01:40:12,690
to do it.
But,

2290
01:40:12,691 --> 01:40:14,220
um,
I think that,

2291
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:18,960
I don't know,
I think the idea is that you can just

2292
01:40:18,961 --> 01:40:21,900
hang any clothing on them and it doesn't
affect the hang of the clothing.

2293
01:40:21,901 --> 01:40:24,090
So it's like almost like they're as
close to it being

2294
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,350
like a coat hanger as possible.
I think that's the theoretical

2295
01:40:28,351 --> 01:40:30,420
underpinnings of it.
Um,

2296
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,231
but yeah,
it's true.

2297
01:40:31,231 --> 01:40:34,410
Like if you look at like a,
like a playboy model or like a model for

2298
01:40:34,411 --> 01:40:36,420
like,
you know,

2299
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:39,570
like black men's magazine or you know,
like a model for Max.

2300
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:41,490
I'm like,
they're like the super fit young women,

2301
01:40:41,491 --> 01:40:44,610
you know,
who like have like really good like

2302
01:40:44,611 --> 01:40:46,650
muscles and a really curvy.
Yeah,

2303
01:40:46,651 --> 01:40:50,070
well people like men are naturally
attracted to women with a certain amount

2304
01:40:50,071 --> 01:40:54,070
of body fat.
It's a natural thing to be

2305
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,400
healthy.
Like the whole idea of breasts and butts

2306
01:40:57,401 --> 01:41:02,140
and hips being attractive is because
genetically women who have those things

2307
01:41:02,141 --> 01:41:06,280
will carry children better and we'll be
more likely to be able to nourish those

2308
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:09,400
children because they're healthy.
It's the total genetic thing.

2309
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:12,640
So much so this is the weirdest aspect
of it.

2310
01:41:12,641 --> 01:41:16,630
So much so that if a woman has fake
boobs,

2311
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:18,370
like you know,
they're fake,

2312
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:20,560
you know,
there's no disconnect at all.

2313
01:41:20,561 --> 01:41:25,450
You're absolutely aware that she has
gone through surgery to cut her skin

2314
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:28,840
stuff.
Bags of water in the air that make them

2315
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:29,680
stick out.
You're like,

2316
01:41:29,710 --> 01:41:31,450
oh,
but they stick out more.

2317
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:36,660
Like men will be more attracted sexually
and the sexual attraction is supposed to

2318
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:41,560
at least represent wanting to breed with
that person like you.

2319
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:45,670
You are not just trekked,
you're tricking yourself like it's the

2320
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:50,050
Wa like fake boobs are one of the
weirdest things of all time.

2321
01:41:50,290 --> 01:41:51,820
If you really stop and look at,
if we were,

2322
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:55,450
if aliens came down from another planet
or even historians,

2323
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:58,960
because I guarantee you,
like we were talking about like Bradley

2324
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,740
Manning and Chelsea Manning,
there's gonna come a time in whatever,

2325
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,170
not so distant future the next hundred
years,

2326
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:07,330
but they're just going to be able to
turn you into a woman.

2327
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:08,950
You know,
you're going to say like,

2328
01:42:08,951 --> 01:42:10,810
I don't want to be a woman anymore.
I'd like to be a man.

2329
01:42:10,990 --> 01:42:13,300
They'll make you a man for a year.
I mean like,

2330
01:42:13,301 --> 01:42:14,860
Eh,
I like being molly better.

2331
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,570
You go back to me and molly instead of
Mike,

2332
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:17,650
Molly,
and Mike the show,

2333
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,990
right?
And you,

2334
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,160
I think they going to be able to do that
with press.

2335
01:42:21,161 --> 01:42:22,360
They're going to be able to do that with
everything.

2336
01:42:22,361 --> 01:42:24,760
They're going to be able to manipulate
genetics to the point where,

2337
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,160
um,
if you ever seen or listened to this or

2338
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:29,410
radio lab,
a episode on Crispr,

2339
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,880
I hadn't know it,
that crispr is an a new method of

2340
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:38,830
manipulating genetics that they,
that they have invented.

2341
01:42:38,830 --> 01:42:41,170
It's a really super complicated thing
that I'm going to butcher,

2342
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:46,470
but they've invented it by studying the
DNA of viruses and they figured out how

2343
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:51,790
to utilize that,
that sort of method to manipulate

2344
01:42:52,030 --> 01:42:55,750
eventually at least human dna and the
point where they're going to be able to

2345
01:42:55,751 --> 01:42:57,700
change your traits.
They got to make a change.

2346
01:42:57,730 --> 01:42:59,410
They're going to be able to change so
many different things,

2347
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:04,411
introduce genes into specific areas of
your body and fix problems or change

2348
01:43:04,901 --> 01:43:07,720
things that you don't like.
Are they going to go do some fucking

2349
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:10,780
freaky shit?
And this is just one invention that is,

2350
01:43:10,810 --> 01:43:15,810
I think 2012 it was invented and by the
time 2032 rolls around,

2351
01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:18,850
who the fuck knows what they're going to
have?

2352
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:22,720
I think we're really close to be able
to,

2353
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:24,700
to just completely manipulate human
bodies.

2354
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:28,600
But the point being when historians go
back and they look at fake boobs,

2355
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:31,450
they're going to be like,
what the fuck were these people doing?

2356
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:34,780
Like how weird is this?
There's going to be a smithsonian that

2357
01:43:34,781 --> 01:43:39,370
has like boxes of like silicone and this
is the early days and this was when they

2358
01:43:39,371 --> 01:43:42,430
went to céline and you know,
we're going to look at that stuff going,

2359
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:45,730
what a strange time to be alive.
But the thing is though,

2360
01:43:45,731 --> 01:43:48,100
like with chicory and like matters of
aesthetics,

2361
01:43:48,110 --> 01:43:52,070
I didn't even want to call it trickery.
I mean there's all sorts of like you can

2362
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:55,430
like totally like admire,
like think a guy like looks really hot

2363
01:43:55,431 --> 01:43:57,590
and a sharp suit even though you know
it's not really his scan.

2364
01:43:57,591 --> 01:43:58,730
You know what I mean?
It's,

2365
01:43:58,860 --> 01:43:59,990
it's not,
there's,

2366
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:02,990
there's a whole like sort of visual
appreciation of other people that

2367
01:44:02,991 --> 01:44:05,540
doesn't necessarily just have to do with
like what's the,

2368
01:44:06,020 --> 01:44:07,610
you know,
the quote unquote real or like what's

2369
01:44:07,611 --> 01:44:09,830
your genetic heritage?
That's really true.

2370
01:44:09,831 --> 01:44:11,360
A closer,
a great exam.

2371
01:44:11,361 --> 01:44:14,090
That's a really good example because
that is weird.

2372
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:16,190
Like you see someone who's dressed sharp
and you go,

2373
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,320
Ooh man,
he looks great in that suit.

2374
01:44:18,321 --> 01:44:21,050
Like that's a beautiful vest.
Like wow,

2375
01:44:21,051 --> 01:44:23,360
that looks awesome on him.
That's a strange thing.

2376
01:44:23,361 --> 01:44:26,030
Like you look good with stuff on you.
Yeah,

2377
01:44:26,031 --> 01:44:27,650
exactly.
It could hang stuff on you that makes

2378
01:44:27,651 --> 01:44:31,580
you look good or professional or
authoritive or all of these other

2379
01:44:31,581 --> 01:44:33,110
things,
even though like they're just like stuff

2380
01:44:33,111 --> 01:44:35,480
that you're wearing.
I wonder if that's a truth.

2381
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:38,690
The same with hermit crabs.
Oh my.

2382
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:41,510
Out a good shell.
Could you imagine like someone's like,

2383
01:44:41,570 --> 01:44:43,580
I'm wearing like the really slick cool.
Shall look,

2384
01:44:43,581 --> 01:44:45,350
I'm going to get all the girl hermit
crabs right now.

2385
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:46,520
Yeah,
probably right.

2386
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:50,790
There's some weird things in nature with
animals doing things like,

2387
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:52,220
oh,
how about animals that can actually

2388
01:44:52,221 --> 01:44:54,590
money.
Have you ever paid attention to octopus

2389
01:44:54,591 --> 01:44:55,850
at all?
Um,

2390
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,860
[inaudible] you know,
I'm like,

2391
01:44:58,010 --> 01:45:00,800
I'm pretty shamefully ignorant.
You might have to educate me here.

2392
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,330
I had,
well apparently cuddle

2393
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:06,700
fish are just as bizarre if not more.
But my friend Remy Warren is a,

2394
01:45:06,701 --> 01:45:09,610
um,
he's a host of a show called the Apex

2395
01:45:09,611 --> 01:45:11,570
Predator where they,
um,

2396
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:13,480
they monitor,
they will,

2397
01:45:13,510 --> 01:45:14,560
they sort of,
um,

2398
01:45:16,240 --> 01:45:21,240
try to emulate the different attributes
that certain predators have and how they

2399
01:45:23,261 --> 01:45:25,780
survive and see like if there's like
some,

2400
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,820
a human version of that.
And,

2401
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:28,920
and um,
they,

2402
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:31,660
they,
they like check out like how,

2403
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:33,760
uh,
it's called heroin and that those tall

2404
01:45:33,761 --> 01:45:35,590
birds Harun herons,
herons.

2405
01:45:35,820 --> 01:45:38,200
How do you say that?
Heron heron herons.

2406
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:41,530
Um,
like how they walk with their crazy long

2407
01:45:41,531 --> 01:45:45,400
legs and then stab at the water looking
for like frogs and shit.

2408
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:49,480
And he did one on octopus's and at of
all the different animals we were

2409
01:45:49,481 --> 01:45:50,500
talking about,
he was like,

2410
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:51,850
you know,
there's all these cool animals.

2411
01:45:51,851 --> 01:45:55,030
They were talking about like how wolves
will chase down packs of elk and how

2412
01:45:55,031 --> 01:45:58,720
they cornered them and in these canyons
and draws and how they figured out how

2413
01:45:58,721 --> 01:45:59,430
to trap them.

2414
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:01,960
It's really fascinating.
But when he started talking about

2415
01:46:01,961 --> 01:46:02,860
octopus,
he's like,

2416
01:46:02,861 --> 01:46:05,350
dude,
you have never see our fucking aliens.

2417
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,870
Like,
look at these things like what color

2418
01:46:06,871 --> 01:46:09,640
they can change their colors.
Like this is real.

2419
01:46:09,910 --> 01:46:13,840
They can change their colors and
immediately adapt to their environment

2420
01:46:14,080 --> 01:46:17,140
to the point where they're
indistinguishable from the background.

2421
01:46:17,950 --> 01:46:19,660
This is amazing.
Oh,

2422
01:46:19,661 --> 01:46:21,730
they're insane.
They're insane.

2423
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:23,200
They're there.
They can,

2424
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:28,230
they can instantaneously like within
fractions of a second change the outside

2425
01:46:28,541 --> 01:46:31,300
of their body to look exactly like a
coral reef,

2426
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:34,720
not just in the image but in the
texture.

2427
01:46:35,650 --> 01:46:38,830
They do all kinds of,
they can change themselves to look more

2428
01:46:38,831 --> 01:46:42,420
like predators or like dangerous things.
It's,

2429
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:46,030
it's incredible what they can do.
You live from the coolest world.

2430
01:46:46,031 --> 01:46:47,300
My God.
Oh,

2431
01:46:47,301 --> 01:46:49,030
the world's amazing.
The world.

2432
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,970
The ocean still like,
um,

2433
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,310
there's some new project that they're
doing right now.

2434
01:46:53,350 --> 01:46:56,010
Um,
or they're trying to map the ocean floor

2435
01:46:56,580 --> 01:47:01,580
and there without a doubt they're going
to discover some freaky fucking fish

2436
01:47:01,741 --> 01:47:05,910
life marine life down there that we've
never encountered before.

2437
01:47:06,090 --> 01:47:10,620
But just these creatures were just
starting to learn what these things are

2438
01:47:10,621 --> 01:47:11,640
doing.
Like,

2439
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:15,810
look at that like a flower or something
on fast motion.

2440
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:18,640
That's an octopus.
That's not to be

2441
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:24,600
a Wiki or something looks like,
but watch this,

2442
01:47:24,601 --> 01:47:25,080
it,
it,

2443
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:27,690
it can merge with these,
um,

2444
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:30,330
coral reefs and it looks like a coral
reef.

2445
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:34,860
So it's literally developed this ability
to turn his body into the shape of a

2446
01:47:34,861 --> 01:47:37,080
reef.
And then it's little tiny.

2447
01:47:37,081 --> 01:47:38,610
I mean it's,
it curls,

2448
01:47:38,611 --> 01:47:42,600
it's tentacles up into little tiny legs
and runs on two legs.

2449
01:47:42,840 --> 01:47:45,120
It's fucking incredible.
They're amazing.

2450
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:45,781
Wow.
And look,

2451
01:47:45,781 --> 01:47:49,230
it's like a teardrop shape.
That's so cool.

2452
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,380
It's amazing.
He's just octopuses is just cause

2453
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:54,780
they're fun to draw with all the
tentacles and stuff.

2454
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:55,830
But I,
God,

2455
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:56,850
yeah,
I had no idea.

2456
01:47:57,270 --> 01:48:00,660
I had no idea.
Like the fact that they can do it like

2457
01:48:00,661 --> 01:48:05,661
that they just change like fucking what
a weird world and the communicate with

2458
01:48:06,031 --> 01:48:08,640
each other somehow through that.
And we don't know how we know they're

2459
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:11,670
really fucking smart though.
Are they going to take it all over after

2460
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:14,010
we destroy everything?
The OCTOPI are going to rule the earth.

2461
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,510
Well,
that's something I've been like really

2462
01:48:15,511 --> 01:48:20,160
dwelling on lately when it comes to
marine life and dolphins and orcas and

2463
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:24,870
I'm a huge believer that they are just
as intelligent as us,

2464
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:27,770
if not more.
And that what we're doing with seaworld

2465
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:32,780
and all these wild dolphin shows is
nothing less than slavery.

2466
01:48:33,420 --> 01:48:37,560
It's slavery of some alien intelligence
that we can't communicate with.

2467
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:39,460
We don't understand what they're saying.
So really,

2468
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,770
um,
can hear you.

2469
01:48:40,771 --> 01:48:41,700
I don't know what you're saying.

2470
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:45,030
So fucking jumped for fish or starve.
It's your choice.

2471
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,650
And um,
I've,

2472
01:48:46,651 --> 01:48:50,130
I've thought about it but like our ideas
about what is intelligent,

2473
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:53,220
like we don't think that something's
intelligent and less,

2474
01:48:53,221 --> 01:48:56,220
it does exactly what we do.
When we,

2475
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:57,840
when we think of intelligence,
we say,

2476
01:48:57,870 --> 01:48:58,710
okay,
well molly,

2477
01:48:58,711 --> 01:49:01,050
send me an email.
I sent her an email back.

2478
01:49:01,051 --> 01:49:03,270
I know she's intelligent.
She's communicating through an email.

2479
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:05,430
The Dolphin is not a fucking make an
email.

2480
01:49:05,431 --> 01:49:06,480
He's an idiot.
You know,

2481
01:49:06,481 --> 01:49:08,100
like,
but they don't need email.

2482
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,410
Like why do we need email?
We need email cause we need to

2483
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:12,540
communicate well.
They can communicate from miles through

2484
01:49:12,541 --> 01:49:14,670
the water with their chirps and their
noises.

2485
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,670
They recognize each other from,
you know,

2486
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:20,490
years and years being apart from each
other.

2487
01:49:20,491 --> 01:49:22,500
Even though to us,
they all look the fucking same.

2488
01:49:22,860 --> 01:49:26,490
They can move and manipulate through
three d space in the water.

2489
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:29,820
They don't need a house because they're
smart enough to go with a water's warm

2490
01:49:30,060 --> 01:49:32,880
fishes everywhere and it's free so they
don't need jobs.

2491
01:49:33,090 --> 01:49:37,110
So all these ideas that we have is like
what represents intelligence,

2492
01:49:37,320 --> 01:49:39,690
all that stuff,
stupid cause to them.

2493
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,760
I feel like,
well I'm going to build a house and

2494
01:49:41,761 --> 01:49:43,170
drive my car to work.
They're like,

2495
01:49:43,171 --> 01:49:44,880
what are you talking about,
bitch or under the water?

2496
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:48,070
Like if you do like,
I need a hoard it all the fish and my

2497
01:49:48,071 --> 01:49:51,360
thing and like kill them and then I'll
sell you the fucking fish for calc.

2498
01:49:51,361 --> 01:49:52,770
That's a great idea.
They'd be like,

2499
01:49:52,771 --> 01:49:54,670
what?
Like your high dolphin.

2500
01:49:54,730 --> 01:49:57,030
I'm going to write you a letter from my
laptop was,

2501
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,450
there's no internet down here.
Stupid.

2502
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:01,180
There's no like you're a crap dolphin.
Yeah,

2503
01:50:01,181 --> 01:50:01,720
you're,
you're,

2504
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,180
you're fucking laptops,
not gonna work on their water asshole.

2505
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:09,790
So all of our ideas about what,
what's intelligent is only based on our

2506
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:14,200
ability to manipulate or environment or
create things that didn't exist.

2507
01:50:14,350 --> 01:50:17,260
So our intelligence is a very bizarre
intelligence because it's,

2508
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:22,261
we the only intelligence that can not
just manipulate our or environment

2509
01:50:22,781 --> 01:50:25,360
that's local.
But our environment globally,

2510
01:50:25,361 --> 01:50:28,030
like we can,
we can essentially change the weather.

2511
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:32,170
We can spray,
we can cloud seed and make it rain and

2512
01:50:32,171 --> 01:50:33,610
put like,
that's one of the weird things they do

2513
01:50:33,611 --> 01:50:36,460
in Abu Dhabi.
They make it rain every week.

2514
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:40,930
They do it on purpose.
They spray the sky with some sort of

2515
01:50:40,931 --> 01:50:44,140
silver something or another that makes
it,

2516
01:50:44,141 --> 01:50:46,270
I don't forget what the exact compound
is,

2517
01:50:46,271 --> 01:50:50,350
but it actually causes it to rain.
And they've been doing it like once a

2518
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:53,180
week for years.
They have rainstorms that they

2519
01:50:53,181 --> 01:50:56,320
manufacturer,
we're freaks,

2520
01:50:56,430 --> 01:50:58,570
we're freaks.
And our intelligence is fundamentally

2521
01:50:58,571 --> 01:51:01,150
built on dissatisfaction,
which I mean we have to have,

2522
01:51:01,151 --> 01:51:04,690
cause we're also like weak and not apex
predators necessarily.

2523
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:07,780
And we're getting weaker I think too.
I think that's part of it.

2524
01:51:08,240 --> 01:51:10,690
You know,
if you went back to the early humans and

2525
01:51:10,691 --> 01:51:14,290
you compare it like our tendons and bone
structure and are they,

2526
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:15,760
are they really humans?
Are they,

2527
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:17,710
are they stronger than us?
It was that they were like shorter and

2528
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:18,220
stuff.
The,

2529
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:21,760
her dolls were so not really humans
right there,

2530
01:51:21,761 --> 01:51:24,640
like a type of human and the how they
categorize them,

2531
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:27,910
they were way stronger than I was.
So they weren't just stronger than us.

2532
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:32,170
They were like really short.
There were like five foot five foot two

2533
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:35,920
and,
but like 220 pounds just fucking gorilla

2534
01:51:35,921 --> 01:51:40,090
like with super thick bones and fic
heads.

2535
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:44,740
And then they don't really know exactly
how intelligent they were either.

2536
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:46,540
This,
all this speculation as to whether or

2537
01:51:46,541 --> 01:51:50,310
not they figured out tools on their own
or whether they copied them from Homo

2538
01:51:50,311 --> 01:51:55,311
sapiens and where homosapiens came from
and they interbreed and there's debate

2539
01:51:55,811 --> 01:51:56,820
on that as well.

2540
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:59,410
And it's a,
and then they're always fun on these,

2541
01:51:59,411 --> 01:52:01,240
fucking knew their violin.
Another one,

2542
01:52:01,241 --> 01:52:05,110
like within the last couple of weeks
they found another new species of human.

2543
01:52:05,160 --> 01:52:09,250
We didn't know existed.
They found some large tooth that,

2544
01:52:09,251 --> 01:52:12,070
uh,
turned out to be not category,

2545
01:52:12,071 --> 01:52:15,670
it was a human tooth,
but not categorized in any previous

2546
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,610
version of human beings that they were
aware of before.

2547
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:20,620
Or if they found quite a few of them
now,

2548
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,700
including the,
I'm sure you've heard of like that.

2549
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:24,970
The hobbit people they found the island
of Flores,

2550
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:28,300
that was 14,000 years ago.
That's not that long ago.

2551
01:52:28,301 --> 01:52:31,180
No luck.
That's not before the beginning of

2552
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:33,190
recorded history as it,
it's quill.

2553
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:37,060
I always a little bit before,
a little bit depends on whose version of

2554
01:52:37,061 --> 01:52:40,420
the beginning of recorded history is.
There's a bought a bunch of people that

2555
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:41,630
believe,
um,

2556
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:44,200
there's this guy that I've had on my
podcast a few times now.

2557
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,370
His name's Randall Carlson and he's an
expert in,

2558
01:52:46,780 --> 01:52:49,250
um,
cataclysmic events and,

2559
01:52:49,251 --> 01:52:52,070
uh,
especially a asteroidal impacts.

2560
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,060
And,
uh,

2561
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:57,350
him and this guy,
Graham Hancock have worked together and

2562
01:52:57,351 --> 01:52:59,780
Graham Hancock wrote this book called
fingerprints of the Gods.

2563
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:01,790
It was a really controversial book in
the 90s.

2564
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:04,910
And then now he has a new one called
magicians of the gods,

2565
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:09,911
which is sort of shows how much of his
early work that was widely criticized

2566
01:53:10,401 --> 01:53:15,020
was actually substantiated now by
science where these ancient structures

2567
01:53:15,021 --> 01:53:16,970
that didn't make any sense.
So they were trying to figure out like

2568
01:53:16,971 --> 01:53:20,690
who fucking built these and how the WHO
or how they here and archeologists sort

2569
01:53:20,691 --> 01:53:25,370
of try to put like vague dates on them.
And the idea behind it was that

2570
01:53:25,580 --> 01:53:28,840
civilization has not evolved and it's
not progressed on a,

2571
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,910
a straight plane,
but rather there's been these peaks and

2572
01:53:31,911 --> 01:53:34,190
valleys.
And then what has happened is people

2573
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:38,870
have gotten this very high level of
sophistication and culture and then

2574
01:53:39,020 --> 01:53:42,770
massive cataclysmic disasters have white
people out almost to the brink of

2575
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:43,993
extinction.

2576
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:46,940
And they've arisen back up again.
So like science is like,

2577
01:53:46,941 --> 01:53:49,310
found quite a few of them.
But one of the big ones they keep

2578
01:53:49,311 --> 01:53:54,311
pointing out is that there's somewhere
around 12,000 years ago,

2579
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:59,980
there was a series of uh,
impacts on the earth and has been proven

2580
01:54:00,171 --> 01:54:03,800
by science now because over the last few
years they've discovered this stuff

2581
01:54:03,801 --> 01:54:05,330
called,
I think it's called Triton night,

2582
01:54:05,331 --> 01:54:07,160
but it's essentially called nuclear
glass.

2583
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:09,780
And it exists around where the,
um,

2584
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:14,860
do nuclear tests and it also at exists
at meteor impact sites and it's,

2585
01:54:15,170 --> 01:54:17,300
the impact creates heat that's so
intense.

2586
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:22,301
It turns sand and rock to glass and they
find this stuff all throughout Europe

2587
01:54:22,791 --> 01:54:24,650
and all through,
and it's all around the same time

2588
01:54:24,651 --> 01:54:28,370
period,
which also coincides with the end of the

2589
01:54:28,370 --> 01:54:32,750
ice age.
And it also coincides with a thousand

2590
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:35,390
plus years later,
the beginning of modern civilization,

2591
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:37,100
agriculture,
mathematics.

2592
01:54:37,250 --> 01:54:40,760
And so their,
their theory is that that wasn't exactly

2593
01:54:40,761 --> 01:54:42,950
the beginning,
but that was a rebirth.

2594
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:47,600
And if there was most likely thousands
of years of civilization that existed

2595
01:54:47,601 --> 01:54:50,030
before that,
but it was almost entirely wiped out

2596
01:54:50,210 --> 01:54:52,730
when people are just bombarded with
rocks from the sky.

2597
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:55,980
I mean it makes a lot of sense,
especially when societies where less

2598
01:54:55,981 --> 01:54:59,130
interconnected,
like the whole reason you know stuff

2599
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:03,510
various like you know,
math or astrology survived the dark ages

2600
01:55:03,511 --> 01:55:06,570
in Europe was because in the Middle East
people were able to keep it alive.

2601
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:10,900
We live in a time now where unless they
literally wiped out everyone,

2602
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:14,760
it'd be very hard to do that.
But in a world where people don't have

2603
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:17,160
that level of communication where they
don't have that level of connection

2604
01:55:17,161 --> 01:55:19,980
where they don't have that level of
knowledge sharing,

2605
01:55:19,981 --> 01:55:21,990
it would be very easy for one society to
kind of,

2606
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:24,150
you know,
get to that peak and then something

2607
01:55:24,151 --> 01:55:29,151
horrifying happening to it and no other
societies could carry on that legacy.

2608
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:32,060
Yeah,
I mean it would be pretty easy,

2609
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:35,180
especially today in our culture because
everything has become digital.

2610
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:40,390
It's one of the weirdest things about us
advancing and evolving is that as things

2611
01:55:40,581 --> 01:55:43,830
move to the cloud and as things become
much,

2612
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,040
much less physical books like your book
here,

2613
01:55:47,041 --> 01:55:49,600
but much more like laptops and kindle

2614
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:53,640
Kendall and it has 150 books on or
something like that.

2615
01:55:53,641 --> 01:55:56,580
It's that thin.
It just sits right in my backpack.

2616
01:55:56,581 --> 01:55:58,830
I mean the what,
that's crazy.

2617
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:00,360
It's crazy.
It's like this magicians thing.

2618
01:56:00,361 --> 01:56:04,530
But also you could potentially like drop
a server that had the only copy of

2619
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:08,520
something and have that only copy
disappear.

2620
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:09,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

2621
01:56:09,751 --> 01:56:12,930
And if the power goes out,
you're not getting any of this stuff.

2622
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:16,020
I had a friend who was um,
he was going back into an area where he

2623
01:56:16,021 --> 01:56:18,150
couldn't bring books cause there are
checkpoints and um,

2624
01:56:18,190 --> 01:56:20,910
had a lot of,
and he um,

2625
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,120
had uh,
his itunes account with something that

2626
01:56:24,121 --> 01:56:24,960
like,
it just,

2627
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:26,610
you,
the country that was tied to you

2628
01:56:26,611 --> 01:56:30,090
couldn't buy good ebooks on.
So I remember I was getting him,

2629
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:34,440
I got him all these pirated copies of
like 1984 and like James Baldwin and

2630
01:56:34,441 --> 01:56:37,620
catch 22 and stuff to read and it,
you know,

2631
01:56:37,621 --> 01:56:41,520
he only has like a few hours of power a
day and he's like reading like 1984 on

2632
01:56:41,521 --> 01:56:44,340
his phone.
And it was like the craziest

2633
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:47,460
illustration of both the like ubiquity
of,

2634
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:50,690
you know,
a book and also the limits of it in this

2635
01:56:50,691 --> 01:56:52,440
sort of cloud edge.
Yeah.

2636
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:57,441
There's a lot of limits of it.
Our entire society is dependent upon the

2637
01:56:57,751 --> 01:56:59,910
grid.
If the grid goes down,

2638
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,720
almost none of this stuff is effective,
but by the same token,

2639
01:57:03,721 --> 01:57:06,580
he could smuggle all these books,
past checkpoints and no one knew he had.

2640
01:57:06,581 --> 01:57:06,930
Yeah.

2641
01:57:06,930 --> 01:57:07,920
Right.
Yeah.

2642
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:08,970
No,
I mean there's,

2643
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:12,450
there's definitely,
if you're in a war torn area like that,

2644
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,740
it's a great,
it's just,

2645
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:14,340
to me,
it,

2646
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:17,450
it freaks me out when I think of,
if something like that happened.

2647
01:57:17,451 --> 01:57:18,510
Like there was,
um,

2648
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:22,440
a big event,
I think it was in Indonesia and at

2649
01:57:22,441 --> 01:57:25,200
70,000 years ago,
they think that civilization was wiped

2650
01:57:25,201 --> 01:57:28,110
out to the point of there being only a
couple thousand people left on the

2651
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:28,900
planet.
Yeah.

2652
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,950
Super Volcano erupted.
Um,

2653
01:57:31,290 --> 01:57:35,820
if anything remotely like that happened,
we would instantaneously be brought

2654
01:57:35,821 --> 01:57:38,460
right back to where people were 50,000
years ago.

2655
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:40,990
Well,
most of us don't have any sort of skills

2656
01:57:40,991 --> 01:57:42,610
to maintain or rebuild anything.
I mean,

2657
01:57:42,611 --> 01:57:43,444
I don't,
I,

2658
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,340
I know if there like the Zombie
apocalypse,

2659
01:57:45,341 --> 01:57:47,680
I,
I'd be like fucking food or something.

2660
01:57:47,681 --> 01:57:48,200
Yeah.

2661
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:51,950
And what if we broke into a home depot?
Like there's a home depot that's like a

2662
01:57:51,950 --> 01:57:54,380
few miles from here.
How many fucking people could get a

2663
01:57:54,381 --> 01:57:56,990
hammer from there?
There's a lot of people out here,

2664
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,100
you know,
this is not enough.

2665
01:57:58,100 --> 01:57:59,520
There's not enough hammers.
Yeah.

2666
01:57:59,550 --> 01:58:00,530
I mean,
we wouldn't even,

2667
01:58:00,770 --> 01:58:03,230
I mean,
we'd hope the shelters that we have hold

2668
01:58:03,231 --> 01:58:05,000
up,
but then where are we going to get food?

2669
01:58:05,001 --> 01:58:07,970
Like what do,
unless we get into the ocean and go

2670
01:58:07,971 --> 01:58:09,770
fishing,
like what are you gonna get to shoot

2671
01:58:09,771 --> 01:58:10,620
deer?
How many deer?

2672
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,380
They're like five and this whole
neighborhood,

2673
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,010
you know.

2674
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:16,970
Well it's the level of population
density we have could never be supported

2675
01:58:16,971 --> 01:58:18,740
by like traditional agriculture ever.

2676
01:58:18,830 --> 01:58:20,240
Not Anymore.
No.

2677
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:22,110
It's weird.
You know what else is weird?

2678
01:58:22,111 --> 01:58:23,720
The friend of mine pointed this out.
He goes,

2679
01:58:23,721 --> 01:58:27,920
why is it that when you walked on the
street you see all these plants but none

2680
01:58:27,921 --> 01:58:32,060
of them grow food.
Like everyone grows plants everywhere.

2681
01:58:32,061 --> 01:58:33,830
But there are all these fucking useless
plants.

2682
01:58:34,100 --> 01:58:36,620
Like what?
Wouldn't it be amazing if like cities

2683
01:58:36,621 --> 01:58:40,440
were filled with plants that grow fruit
and all the,

2684
01:58:40,441 --> 01:58:44,050
the grasses and stuff he saw were edible
and there was lettuce everywhere.

2685
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:45,970
Like literally everything had food on
it.

2686
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,100
Like it would be just the same amount of
water used,

2687
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:50,590
but you would actually get something out
of it.

2688
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:52,630
But we're so rich,
they were like,

2689
01:58:52,631 --> 01:58:53,830
nope.
Pine trees.

2690
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:55,030
No,
I want to oak,

2691
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:57,490
I want a beautiful oak here.
Like we don't,

2692
01:58:57,550 --> 01:58:59,350
you know,
we don't support the,

2693
01:58:59,351 --> 01:59:00,100
the,
the,

2694
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,490
the trees and the plants around us that
we can actually eat.

2695
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:08,910
I remember one time I was in um,
Spain and I was like 17,

2696
01:59:08,911 --> 01:59:10,580
it was broke and I was with my,
my,

2697
01:59:10,650 --> 01:59:12,700
my friend and we saw like,
wow,

2698
01:59:12,701 --> 01:59:13,840
he's orange,
cheesy,

2699
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:16,540
steal a lot of oranges to be like,
climb up the tree and be like,

2700
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:19,240
steal all the oranges.
And then we like peel them and then

2701
01:59:19,270 --> 01:59:21,040
they're like bitter and dry and we're
like,

2702
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:23,080
these are fucking decorative oranges.
They tricked us.

2703
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:26,260
They tricked us with their there.
These oranges are lies.

2704
01:59:26,710 --> 01:59:29,890
And I,
I think that they specifically probably

2705
01:59:29,891 --> 01:59:33,100
planted those type of oranges to avoid
bad people like us climbing the trees

2706
01:59:33,101 --> 01:59:34,330
and stealing all of them.

2707
01:59:34,670 --> 01:59:37,070
Is that funny?
You're a bad person because you're doing

2708
01:59:37,071 --> 01:59:39,380
what people have done for the last week.
Exactly.

2709
01:59:39,560 --> 01:59:42,590
Yeah.
We're bad person for picking fruit from

2710
01:59:42,591 --> 01:59:44,090
a tree.
How strange.

2711
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:48,530
This is w and it's also probably those
were what orange is really tasted like

2712
01:59:48,531 --> 01:59:51,650
before we start fucking with them.
I refuse to believe that that's a cruel

2713
01:59:51,651 --> 01:59:52,484
world.

2714
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:54,120
Well,
they,

2715
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:57,840
they know that the fact for like corn,
a lot of other food was like really

2716
01:59:57,841 --> 02:00:00,540
gross before people started manipulating
it.

2717
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:02,620
Truth,
truth,

2718
02:00:02,621 --> 02:00:03,520
but orange is,
I want to,

2719
02:00:03,521 --> 02:00:06,580
I want to believe that like prehistoric
oranges were a tasty treat and these

2720
02:00:06,581 --> 02:00:07,310
were not,

2721
02:00:07,310 --> 02:00:08,143
I dunno,
I,

2722
02:00:08,150 --> 02:00:12,050
I ate an apple the other day and me and
my friends were laughing more eating

2723
02:00:12,051 --> 02:00:14,540
these apples were like,
these fucking things have definitely

2724
02:00:14,541 --> 02:00:18,860
been fucked with like there were big,
big giant and they were so juicy.

2725
02:00:19,040 --> 02:00:21,440
We're like,
what kind of genetically modified shit

2726
02:00:21,441 --> 02:00:23,780
are we eating right now?
Because these are just not normal

2727
02:00:23,781 --> 02:00:25,880
apples.
Giant juicy,

2728
02:00:25,881 --> 02:00:26,960
delicious apples.

2729
02:00:27,150 --> 02:00:29,700
Probably in like the middle of apple off
season two.

2730
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:30,720
Yeah,
probably.

2731
02:00:30,810 --> 02:00:33,450
Do you ever had a crab apple,
molly crab apple?

2732
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:36,030
I have a photo of Mandurah crab apple
tree,

2733
02:00:36,031 --> 02:00:39,690
but I don't,
I don't know if her friend took that

2734
02:00:39,691 --> 02:00:40,860
one.
I don't know if I've ever eaten the crab

2735
02:00:40,861 --> 02:00:41,820
apple man.
I,

2736
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:45,000
I,
I'm sure this will get remedied someday,

2737
02:00:45,001 --> 02:00:46,100
but uh,
not,

2738
02:00:46,101 --> 02:00:47,100
not yet.
I don't think.

2739
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,240
Really.
Yeah,

2740
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:50,970
I mean I,
oh no,

2741
02:00:50,971 --> 02:00:52,020
you're,
oh my God.

2742
02:00:52,021 --> 02:00:53,220
You're right.
God,

2743
02:00:53,221 --> 02:00:54,690
I'm getting like deep into the memory
bank.

2744
02:00:54,720 --> 02:00:57,750
When I was seven and I lived in far
rockaway.

2745
02:00:58,110 --> 02:01:01,110
I think one of the neighbors had a crab
apple tree or it had the tree with the

2746
02:01:01,111 --> 02:01:02,170
little apples.
There's the ground,

2747
02:01:02,470 --> 02:01:04,260
the crab apples.
And I believe that,

2748
02:01:04,261 --> 02:01:05,490
um,
I believe I stole some of them and I

2749
02:01:05,491 --> 02:01:06,370
believe they're very sour.

2750
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:07,463
Yeah,
I remember them.

2751
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,000
Yeah,
they're very sour.

2752
02:01:09,001 --> 02:01:10,860
I ate one of those when I was a little
kid.

2753
02:01:10,861 --> 02:01:13,350
Well more than once.
I'm sure when I was a little kid growing

2754
02:01:13,351 --> 02:01:16,230
up from Massachusetts,
I remember biting into those things.

2755
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:18,780
Oh yeah.
So much hope.

2756
02:01:19,220 --> 02:01:21,000
Yeah,
the good they're throwing at people

2757
02:01:21,001 --> 02:01:22,680
though.
That's what we use them for.

2758
02:01:22,870 --> 02:01:25,090
The kids taste nice.
Chuck them at each other.

2759
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:26,490
Small and hard like,
yeah.

2760
02:01:26,491 --> 02:01:29,830
Well you know your little tiny hands and
get a good grip on the crab apple new

2761
02:01:29,860 --> 02:01:30,840
whip it.
Nice.

2762
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:32,610
Nice.
Um,

2763
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:34,620
what else you got going on these days
besides,

2764
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:36,690
I know you're promoting this book and
uh,

2765
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:40,160
besides that,
so I'm going to really excited

2766
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,840
about this.
I'm going to India for a month cause

2767
02:01:41,841 --> 02:01:43,730
there's all these literary festivals in
India,

2768
02:01:43,731 --> 02:01:45,170
so I'm getting to good.
Yeah,

2769
02:01:45,171 --> 02:01:48,770
I'm getting to it.
Like Dji pour and Mumbai and ben before.

2770
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,970
No,
it's my first time in my life.

2771
02:01:49,971 --> 02:01:53,570
So I'm really excited about that.
And then besides that,

2772
02:01:54,170 --> 02:01:56,330
you know,
I think I'm reaching that point of

2773
02:01:56,331 --> 02:01:57,430
burnout where I,
and just,

2774
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:59,360
I'm like actually planning to take a
month off.

2775
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:01,250
I know it sounds like fun.
It sounds like fucking blast for me,

2776
02:02:01,251 --> 02:02:06,080
but I think I,
I'm going to like lie on a beach and go

2777
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:09,470
or something and read a lot of books.
And other than that,

2778
02:02:09,471 --> 02:02:12,590
the only thing I really have to talk
about is my super dork hobby,

2779
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:13,510
which is a,
um,

2780
02:02:13,550 --> 02:02:14,600
I've been studying,
um,

2781
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:18,440
literary Arabic for the last year and I
got pretty good at translating stuff.

2782
02:02:18,470 --> 02:02:19,190
Written stuff.

2783
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:20,210
Really?
Yeah.

2784
02:02:20,211 --> 02:02:22,130
Yeah.
I'm really pretty proud of it.

2785
02:02:22,131 --> 02:02:23,940
I do this every morning.
Uh,

2786
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:26,230
so I'm translating,
uh,

2787
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:30,860
like long dialogue by the Syrian poet
that's called sex poetry in the

2788
02:02:30,861 --> 02:02:34,970
revolution and it is bad ass.
But other than that,

2789
02:02:34,971 --> 02:02:38,180
I,
I think I'm actually going into that

2790
02:02:38,181 --> 02:02:40,430
lake time where I'm just making like a
little blank space.

2791
02:02:40,431 --> 02:02:43,370
And then at the end of that I'll
probably be back doing a bunch of

2792
02:02:43,371 --> 02:02:47,270
journalism for vice doing stuff on
prisons in the Middle East working on my

2793
02:02:47,271 --> 02:02:50,060
next book project and I don't know,
seeing,

2794
02:02:50,090 --> 02:02:53,250
seeing where life goes cause thing
that's so strange about doing a memoir

2795
02:02:53,251 --> 02:02:58,251
or is it really is like sectioning off
at chapter six section off,

2796
02:02:59,270 --> 02:03:02,330
you know,
15 years of your life and then you've

2797
02:03:02,331 --> 02:03:05,150
taken all of that and you've put it into
this book for him.

2798
02:03:05,151 --> 02:03:08,630
You've made it into an object and then
you go onto what's next.

2799
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:12,260
And I,
I guess while I have the vague contours

2800
02:03:12,261 --> 02:03:15,500
of that in my head,
part of me just wants to do nothing for

2801
02:03:15,501 --> 02:03:16,970
awhile and then the plan will come to
me.

2802
02:03:17,060 --> 02:03:18,630
I think that's a great idea.
I'm,

2803
02:03:18,631 --> 02:03:21,380
I'm thinking the same thing about my own
life right now.

2804
02:03:21,381 --> 02:03:25,820
I think I'm too involved and too many
different things and I could use a

2805
02:03:25,890 --> 02:03:28,460
reset,
like a calming as to,

2806
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:32,120
I think you get that.
It's all good stuff and that's the

2807
02:03:32,121 --> 02:03:34,790
problem and I think that's what you're
experiencing as well.

2808
02:03:34,791 --> 02:03:37,250
Like,
you have so many cool things you have

2809
02:03:37,251 --> 02:03:38,240
going on.
Awesome.

2810
02:03:38,241 --> 02:03:40,220
I feel so lucky.
Yeah.

2811
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:42,470
But it's,
but if there's no space,

2812
02:03:42,950 --> 02:03:45,170
I mean can absorb them.
Yeah.

2813
02:03:45,171 --> 02:03:46,970
It's like that,
that Louis C K thing about like never

2814
02:03:46,971 --> 02:03:48,050
being bored,
you know?

2815
02:03:48,051 --> 02:03:50,540
I mean I have that in the best of all
possible ways.

2816
02:03:50,541 --> 02:03:53,780
I have like so many cool opportunities,
but if you never have like any,

2817
02:03:53,870 --> 02:03:58,160
any time to like be bored or be down,
you're just like bouncing from thing to

2818
02:03:58,161 --> 02:04:00,440
thing and yeah,
I think,

2819
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:00,690
yeah.

2820
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:03,330
Louis C K thing about never being born.
I'm not aware of it.

2821
02:04:03,460 --> 02:04:05,550
Uh,
it was like a monologue that he had a,

2822
02:04:05,551 --> 02:04:07,970
about where he was saying that since we
have smartphones,

2823
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:09,520
basically we just,
right now I remember it.

2824
02:04:09,521 --> 02:04:11,680
Yeah.
So you never had like any space to feel

2825
02:04:11,681 --> 02:04:13,660
anything or to,
or to be bored.

2826
02:04:13,661 --> 02:04:16,190
And so you're just always in a state of
distraction.

2827
02:04:16,191 --> 02:04:19,150
And I think it can be like that with
work stuff too.

2828
02:04:19,151 --> 02:04:22,690
So after that,
probably just probably just doing a

2829
02:04:22,691 --> 02:04:25,420
bunch of journalism stuff.
I work a lot with a really cool,

2830
02:04:25,440 --> 02:04:28,720
I'm Syrian American nonprofit that I'm
going to plug here.

2831
02:04:29,140 --> 02:04:34,140
They're called a cutter.
I'm foundation and I'm they k a r a m

2832
02:04:34,810 --> 02:04:38,160
and they do something really cool
because a lot attention right now it's

2833
02:04:38,161 --> 02:04:40,770
on the Syrian refugees that make it to
Europe,

2834
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,730
but they actually work with people who
are displaced inside Syria.

2835
02:04:44,731 --> 02:04:46,440
And then also people like on the border.

2836
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:48,260
And for the last two years,
uh,

2837
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:52,320
I've taken part in a program with them
where we go down to the schools that are

2838
02:04:52,321 --> 02:04:55,580
on the border and they bring like,
they bring the dentists,

2839
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:57,270
the fix all the kids' teeth.
They,

2840
02:04:57,271 --> 02:04:59,130
uh,
bring up I doctors that get all the kids

2841
02:04:59,131 --> 02:05:02,640
glasses that need it,
but then they also bring like writers

2842
02:05:02,641 --> 02:05:05,430
and philosophers and architects and
like,

2843
02:05:05,610 --> 02:05:07,170
you know,
people who teach classes with the kids.

2844
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:09,390
And I was a,
I always do murals there.

2845
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:13,050
I've done murals in two schools now and
so next spring I'll probably be back

2846
02:05:13,051 --> 02:05:17,130
with them a painting,
lots of rebellious cats all over a

2847
02:05:17,490 --> 02:05:18,750
school in southeast Turkey.

2848
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:20,700
Wow.
You live such a low ball,

2849
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:26,090
broad and fascinating life.
I mean you've had so many really intense

2850
02:05:26,091 --> 02:05:31,091
experiences and and,
and all over the place,

2851
02:05:31,221 --> 02:05:33,770
like about both,
all the place professionally and

2852
02:05:34,010 --> 02:05:36,920
creatively.
And then geographically there's so much

2853
02:05:36,921 --> 02:05:38,120
going on.
Like you,

2854
02:05:38,830 --> 02:05:41,120
you,
you're not living a boring life.

2855
02:05:41,270 --> 02:05:42,350
No,
I feel so lucky.

2856
02:05:42,351 --> 02:05:43,760
I mean that's why it's so hard for me to
be,

2857
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:48,070
I need to take a reset because it's like
the whole world is so big and cool and I

2858
02:05:48,080 --> 02:05:49,340
love so many things in it.

2859
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:51,020
Yeah.
But I think,

2860
02:05:51,170 --> 02:05:52,790
I think your instincts are correct
though.

2861
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:54,860
He's just,
it seems to me like you're just,

2862
02:05:54,861 --> 02:05:57,320
you've got so much going on all the
time.

2863
02:05:57,321 --> 02:06:00,110
Constantly in so many different arenas.

2864
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:01,800
Yeah.
It's,

2865
02:06:02,130 --> 02:06:04,250
it's a lot.
But I don't know.

2866
02:06:04,270 --> 02:06:05,820
Must be,
it must be the same with you too.

2867
02:06:05,821 --> 02:06:07,470
I mean like you d ina,
you do comedy,

2868
02:06:07,471 --> 02:06:10,200
you do this like super like thoughtful
talk thing.

2869
02:06:10,201 --> 02:06:12,390
Do you like host MMA stuff?
You mean you've done like so many

2870
02:06:12,391 --> 02:06:16,680
fucking things and I mean it's just
cause like I feel perhaps you feel this

2871
02:06:16,681 --> 02:06:18,540
way.
Like the world is just so big and weird

2872
02:06:18,541 --> 02:06:20,790
and interesting and like I just want to
like learn stuff.

2873
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:23,300
Yeah.
I wish I could live 10 different lives

2874
02:06:23,301 --> 02:06:26,400
simultaneously and have a bunch of
different careers that I'd be interested

2875
02:06:26,401 --> 02:06:27,151
in.
Same.

2876
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:28,140
Same.
Exactly.

2877
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:32,850
But it's like to do any of those things
correctly requires so much attention and

2878
02:06:32,851 --> 02:06:35,070
focus.
It's almost like you can't,

2879
02:06:35,420 --> 02:06:39,720
you can enjoy too many things cause you
then the one thing that you enjoy the

2880
02:06:39,721 --> 02:06:41,880
most or that you choose to enjoy the
most,

2881
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:44,160
he really can't focus on it correctly

2882
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:46,770
or else you just never ever,
ever have downtime ever.

2883
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:49,330
Yeah,
I'm close to that.

2884
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:51,910
I get close to that sometimes but it's
not good.

2885
02:06:52,020 --> 02:06:55,990
But it's weird because like my non
downtime seems very recreational.

2886
02:06:56,490 --> 02:06:57,101
Yeah.
Yeah.

2887
02:06:57,101 --> 02:06:58,300
It's like,
it's Super Fun.

2888
02:06:58,301 --> 02:07:00,490
Like I don't want to like complain like
wow,

2889
02:07:00,491 --> 02:07:05,470
I get to travel all over the world and
meet fascinating people in Confront

2890
02:07:05,470 --> 02:07:07,290
Bastards Boohoo for me.
And yet he didn't,

2891
02:07:07,340 --> 02:07:10,120
you know,
it at a certain,

2892
02:07:10,150 --> 02:07:11,070
at a certain point,

2893
02:07:11,580 --> 02:07:12,413
you know,
um,

2894
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:15,680
this is a big compliment,
but I'm a,

2895
02:07:15,690 --> 02:07:18,210
and I don't mean this in terms of an
imitation,

2896
02:07:18,211 --> 02:07:21,570
but your,
your drawing of trump and Ivanka was

2897
02:07:21,571 --> 02:07:22,980
very ralph steadman s

2898
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:24,410
oh,
I idolize that guy.

2899
02:07:24,411 --> 02:07:25,170
I love him.
No,

2900
02:07:25,170 --> 02:07:26,510
that's it.
That's a massive compliment.

2901
02:07:26,511 --> 02:07:29,000
Like I think that man is like a God
amongst men.

2902
02:07:29,170 --> 02:07:33,430
He's a bad motherfucker for sure.
But that image is just so much like,

2903
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:36,700
I think of it as like a,
the Kentucky Derby is decadent.

2904
02:07:36,701 --> 02:07:37,534
Yeah.

2905
02:07:39,350 --> 02:07:41,590
Monster like toad people.
Oh yeah.

2906
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:44,220
I've got that on framed on my wall,
my office,

2907
02:07:44,250 --> 02:07:48,320
a print from a stubbins illustration of
the Kentucky Derby.

2908
02:07:48,410 --> 02:07:49,243
Cool.
Have you ever had,

2909
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:50,630
have you ever like had him on the
shower?

2910
02:07:50,631 --> 02:07:51,464
Do you want to get in Ken?

2911
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:52,660
I would love to.
I mean,

2912
02:07:52,661 --> 02:07:54,160
I don't know if he's ever in Los
Angeles,

2913
02:07:54,161 --> 02:07:56,530
but I prefer to do these things in
person.

2914
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:59,620
But if he's ever here,
I would love to have much to talk to him

2915
02:07:59,621 --> 02:08:03,510
about a hunter and what it looks like
and what does last at for time hundred

2916
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:04,500
dose and with acid.

2917
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,151
Oh,
when they,

2918
02:08:06,151 --> 02:08:08,360
when they went to,
when they went to the rumble in the

2919
02:08:08,361 --> 02:08:10,890
jungle and hunter like sold their
tickets and,

2920
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:13,460
and he was like drawing and off the TV
screen.

2921
02:08:13,550 --> 02:08:15,230
Yeah.
He was swimming in the pool and he

2922
02:08:15,231 --> 02:08:19,100
totally fucked the whole story up
because he thought that one was going to

2923
02:08:19,101 --> 02:08:20,930
kill Muhammad Ali and he didn't want to
see it.

2924
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:25,270
So you put a Richard Nixon mask on and
swam around the yeah,

2925
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:26,960
the bull.
He to this day over,

2926
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:28,850
well not to this day,
obviously he's dead,

2927
02:08:28,851 --> 02:08:31,940
but considered that one of his biggest
journalistic failures and he went into a

2928
02:08:31,941 --> 02:08:36,650
giant slump after he did that because
like he realized that his decadence and

2929
02:08:36,651 --> 02:08:41,570
his indulgence had actually gotten in
the way of an amazing moment in history.

2930
02:08:42,800 --> 02:08:47,780
God just to realize like the fucking
like beautiful beast that like you rode

2931
02:08:47,781 --> 02:08:50,060
to being who you were.
Like it was turning around and like

2932
02:08:50,120 --> 02:08:52,640
becoming like a sort of cliche that was
fucking up everything.

2933
02:08:52,641 --> 02:08:54,240
You liked it.
Well that's what the,

2934
02:08:54,440 --> 02:08:56,720
did you ever see the uh,
Alex Gibney movie?

2935
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:57,950
Uh,
Gonzo,

2936
02:08:57,951 --> 02:09:01,160
the life and times of Dr. Hunter is
fucking incredible.

2937
02:09:01,161 --> 02:09:04,250
It's so good.
It's such a good documentary.

2938
02:09:04,430 --> 02:09:09,430
But that was almost like initially
that's how they started the movie off.

2939
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:13,400
He started the movie off explaining that
at the end of his life,

2940
02:09:13,401 --> 02:09:15,920
hunter had really stopped being
creative.

2941
02:09:16,220 --> 02:09:19,430
The writing wasn't there anymore.
The things that he wrote were like

2942
02:09:19,431 --> 02:09:21,830
really a middling,
they weren't that good and it was

2943
02:09:21,831 --> 02:09:26,831
because his indulgences and his excesses
had really cooked his brain and he just

2944
02:09:27,921 --> 02:09:31,370
had,
he had become almost a caricature of

2945
02:09:31,371 --> 02:09:35,840
himself and along the lines,
some of the interviews they had found

2946
02:09:35,841 --> 02:09:39,260
him when he was a younger man and when
he had started to become famous and he

2947
02:09:39,261 --> 02:09:41,450
was actually worried about that very
thing.

2948
02:09:41,451 --> 02:09:42,440
You were saying like,
I,

2949
02:09:42,590 --> 02:09:46,820
I can't even get out of my own way
anymore and they don't even necessarily

2950
02:09:46,821 --> 02:09:48,710
when I'm,
when I'm doing these things,

2951
02:09:49,190 --> 02:09:54,190
I can't tell whether or not they want me
and they want my take on things or

2952
02:09:54,351 --> 02:09:56,930
whether they want the reality itself
like an I,

2953
02:09:56,980 --> 02:09:58,640
I'm,
he goes,

2954
02:09:58,790 --> 02:10:01,850
it's almost,
it would almost be better if I died like

2955
02:10:01,851 --> 02:10:02,870
for my own work.

2956
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:04,440
And that was like,
wow,

2957
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:09,540
this guy is like experiencing like a
really early version of both.

2958
02:10:09,891 --> 02:10:13,100
Also very rare that a journalist's
becomes that famous,

2959
02:10:13,130 --> 02:10:14,210
so,
so rare,

2960
02:10:14,211 --> 02:10:16,480
so rare.
But I mean,

2961
02:10:16,510 --> 02:10:19,430
I think the problem was that he,
at a certain point,

2962
02:10:19,431 --> 02:10:22,280
he stopped growing and changing and
pushing himself and it was just more

2963
02:10:22,281 --> 02:10:24,920
comfortable to like stay in the mask.
Yeah,

2964
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:26,750
no doubt.
Yeah.

2965
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:27,673
I think,
um,

2966
02:10:27,680 --> 02:10:32,680
and also the indulgences and the
substances became not just a habit but a

2967
02:10:33,651 --> 02:10:36,920
physical addiction.
And at that point in time,

2968
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:42,140
he's more of a slave to that than he is.
Even though the work itself and the work

2969
02:10:42,141 --> 02:10:44,540
itself is almost like something that
he's eventually going to get to.

2970
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:46,010
I'll get to that eventually.
I'll get to that,

2971
02:10:46,040 --> 02:10:50,030
but it's just cocaine and we read off a
list when Lance Armstrong was here

2972
02:10:50,031 --> 02:10:53,900
yesterday of a typical day in the life
of hunter s Thompson as far as,

2973
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:54,500
oh God.

2974
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,240
Yeah.
It just starts with like massive.

2975
02:10:56,241 --> 02:10:58,430
What it does it start with like ether or
coke.

2976
02:10:58,431 --> 02:11:00,460
What does it start with?
Starts with a sh.

2977
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:04,220
It's like chivas regal cocaine.
Dunhill cigarettes,

2978
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:05,810
cocaine.
Chivas.

2979
02:11:05,811 --> 02:11:08,900
Regal caught me like we read it all off.
It's fucking preposterous.

2980
02:11:08,901 --> 02:11:12,290
Like you should be fucking dead.
And then it says at midnight,

2981
02:11:12,380 --> 02:11:16,220
hunter s Thompson is ready to write and
this is like after getting up at three

2982
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:18,590
God,
you spend your entire time like pouring

2983
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:22,250
liquids into your head and then smoking
things.

2984
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:24,230
But for a while it worked.
Man.

2985
02:11:24,231 --> 02:11:26,720
He wrote some insane shit during that
time.

2986
02:11:27,110 --> 02:11:30,830
He wrote some amazing stuff for,
it's almost like he just red lined his

2987
02:11:30,831 --> 02:11:34,250
brain,
never changed the oil and kept the metal

2988
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:39,640
ground down.
I got it.

2989
02:11:39,650 --> 02:11:42,420
Be Boring and I got to go.
I'm really sorry to hear.

2990
02:11:42,580 --> 02:11:43,580
All right,
well thank you.

2991
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:44,121
No,
please.

2992
02:11:44,121 --> 02:11:46,220
No worries.
Thank you so much for coming on.

2993
02:11:46,221 --> 02:11:50,510

I'm in the middle of it right now and it

2994
02:11:50,511 --> 02:11:54,410

fantastic and honest and,

2995
02:11:54,500 --> 02:11:57,530
and just really,
really good stuff.
