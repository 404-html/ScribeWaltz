7
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:19,150
She gets an iPhone five,

8
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:19,390
right?

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,223
Is that what it is?

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,160
Yeah.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,430
I'm assuming that Holly Mac is a girl.

12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,450
I don't even know if it's girl,

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,111
whoever.

14
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:26,651
Holly Martin.

15
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:26,890
Let's,

16
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:27,610
let's find out.

17
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,200
Let's do a little Google search on Holly.

18
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,034
Mark 23,

19
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,190
should I probably s she's going
to get swarmed by assholes now.

20
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,580
Wow.

21
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,450
I didn't even think of that.

22
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,000
But they wanted you to announce it online.

23
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,660
Well,

24
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,270
Holly Mac 23 got 19 followers.

25
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,070
Soon there will be more.

26
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:43,923
She hot.

27
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:44,530
Um,

28
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,130
listen,

29
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,150
she's a nice person.

30
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:47,080
That's what's important.

31
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:47,531
Yeah,

32
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:48,251
she's very pretty,

33
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,720
but she's got a man in her picture,

34
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:50,140
bud.

35
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,490
So back off.

36
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:52,631
Anyway,

37
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,100
Holly Mac 23,

38
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,320
you win the tin contest.

39
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,340
What is Ting?

40
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,900
Ting is a no bullshit mobile service
company that uses a sprint backbone.

41
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:07,140
What Tim does is they rent time on sprint
but then give you cell phone service

42
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,990
at a in a in a very reasonable
way with no contracts,

43
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,180
no early termination fees,

44
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:17,200
no add on coverages and you
only pay for what you use.

45
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,280
If you use very little,

46
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:22,300
you pay very little and if you use more
you don't have to pay some exorbitant

47
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:23,190
rates that you,

48
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,571
you know,

49
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:28,330
some fines that you'd get when you go
over your data coverage or over your text

50
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:31,690
minutes or any of that nonsense that
you get with other cell phone providers.

51
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,050
And I think that what they're doing is
probably most likely going to be the

52
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,520
future for cell phone companies.

53
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,140
I think the more companies like ting
come around and the more they provide you

54
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:45,520
with excellent service without all the
nonsense and bullshit and contracts and

55
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:48,580
all the crap that everybody
hates about cell phone coverage.

56
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,900
All that stuff is out the window of Tang
and they have the latest and greatest

57
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:54,220
android devices.

58
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,720
They have the HTC one
which is a fantastic phone,

59
00:01:58,721 --> 00:02:01,540
and the Samsung Galaxy s well,

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,060
the galaxy note three which
is the one that I have,

61
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,320
they have the galaxy s four the
galaxy has fives coming out soon.

62
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:13,321
The LG flex point is they have all the
latest and greatest android devices and

63
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,870
they have it in a way where you don't
feel like you're getting ripped off.

64
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,650
The whole point of the contest was to go
to tank and to find out how much money

65
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:22,360
you would save by using Tang,

66
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,470
and 98% of people would
save money with Tang.

67
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,430
That's pretty crazy.

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,000
98% those other 2% I don't know
what the fuck they're doing,

69
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,330
but it's probably some weird shit and
that's why they won't say save any money.

70
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,080
Anyway,

71
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,080
go to [inaudible] dot ting.com and
save yourself $25 off of any of the new

The Joe Rogan experience.

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,030
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

124
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,820
My Pal Bud Brotzmann was my neighbor.

125
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,890
We've been friends for many years,

126
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,830
many a year.

127
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,570
More than two decades,

128
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:53,960
right?

129
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,100
We've been friends for a long time,

130
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,031
17 years,

131
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:56,720
something like that.

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
Long ass time.

133
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,510
A bud every year.

134
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:04,511
Leaves family and friends behind and
travels to Mexico to do this fucking crazy

135
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:05,870
race.

136
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,150
And every year I talked to his wife,

137
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,260
shaking my head,

138
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,310
I talked to other people,

139
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,001
shaking my head,

140
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:14,270
gone that Bud Brotzmann
is a crazy son of a bitch.

141
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Like what the fuck is he doing down in
Mexico doing jumps and flying over hills

142
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,650
while he is brought with him,

143
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,480
Rob Maccachren who is apparently the
man when it comes to this Baja racing

144
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,290
stuff.

145
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,071
And uh,

146
00:05:28,071 --> 00:05:29,870
I mean I'm fascinated by it.

147
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,531
And so,

148
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:30,980
uh,

149
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,230
I'm,

150
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,180
I'm real excited to get you guys on the
podcast and talk about it and I know

151
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:38,330
you've got something upcoming
that you're promoting that a,

152
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,910
so people can get a
chance to check it out.

153
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,571
Yeah,

154
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:40,900
we,

155
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,950
I started racing,

156
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,330
I'm at the TV business,

157
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:43,630
right?

158
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,340
So I think you think I'm crazy,

159
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:48,460
but this race as much
like Mount Everest to me,

160
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,360
you just got to go do it.

161
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:51,760
It starts always starts as
a stupid bucket list thing.

162
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:52,571
You got to go do,

163
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:53,230
right?

164
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,670
So I did it one year,

165
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,740
Rob's and doing it for 25 years.

166
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,430
30 I did it one year,

167
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,780
2005 and I'm like,

168
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,570
I've got to go climb Mount Everest.

169
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,630
I got to go do this thing.

170
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,823
So I did it,

171
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,340
um,

172
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,001
through a sponsor.

173
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:06,380
Might be if Goodrich and I'm like,

174
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,490
oh my God,

175
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,830
and this is actually leans back to you.

176
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,840
This is mixed martial arts of racing.

177
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,250
There's no rules.

178
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,570
There's no classes.

179
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,411
There are there classes,

180
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,221
but there's no rules.

181
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,360
You can do anything you want.

182
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,110
Um,

183
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,610
there's consequences down there.

184
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,450
I mean,

185
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,261
if you don't train,

186
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,094
you don't pay attention.

187
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,701
You don't sleep.

188
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:24,590
You'd go out and party the night
before you have consequences.

189
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:25,160
You get hurt,

190
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,851
you get killed.

191
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,720
You could wreck your car,

192
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,730
you could sit in the middle
of the desert for 20 hours.

193
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:29,750
You know,

194
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,340
I just went to go compete,

195
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,810
Kinda like an iron man.

196
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,830
Like I want to go compete.

197
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,060
I want to finish it all right.

198
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,780
Right.

199
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,640
Just say you did a marathon.

200
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,841
Yeah,

201
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:38,750
I did a marathon.

202
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,111
I'm a be,

203
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:39,980
I get a little trophy,

204
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:40,551
it's fine.

205
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,450
And now I'm hooked.

206
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:41,661
Right?

207
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:43,710
So then it's kind of the Lord,

208
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,780
this majestic place.

209
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,680
Rob will talk about a lot
of this majestic place.

210
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:47,190
So I was like,

211
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,960
I finished,

212
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,700
I'm happy 36 hours in the car.

213
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,301
I finished.

214
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,134
It was great.

215
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,131
Everybody was happy.

216
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,060
I was tired of Shit.

217
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,610
Then the next year I came back
and I want to do it again.

218
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,731
Well,

219
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:57,980
maybe I'll take second or
third or get on the podium.

220
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,191
And then,

221
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:02,420
so I started chasing it and started
chasing and it took me eight years every

222
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:02,830
day,

223
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:03,290
you know,

224
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,660
I work out all the time just to go race.

225
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,730
I watched race videos.

226
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,940
I give as much seat time as I can
because I only do the one race a year.

227
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,100
I do about two races a year,

228
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,010
just one the practice,

229
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:17,270
and then I go down and raise the thousand
and I finally went in 2012 but then

230
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,060
there's guys like rob 200 wins.

231
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:20,781
He's white.

232
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,850
He's won 200 times in off road racing.

233
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,030
He's won five out of all the stats over
at five Baja 100 by by 1005 by one five

234
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,110
hundreds he's,

235
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,880
he's the legend of our sport.

236
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:32,990
He raises in trophy trucks,

237
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,040
which is not my class.

238
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,681
Don't know what,

239
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:37,380
what Baja racing is.

240
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,460
Explain that.

241
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:38,971
What rob,

242
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:39,860
why don't you explain it?

243
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,000
Since you've done it decades.

244
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,750
Absolutely.

245
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,271
Bob.

246
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:48,120
One thousands is Baja peninsula basically
starting Ensonata race all the way

247
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:48,900
down to the pause.

248
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,040
Approximately thousand miles.

249
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,000
All dirt road,

250
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,020
all dirt roads,

251
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,730
some asphalt roads.

252
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:55,230
Sometimes we can't get through dirt.

253
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:58,860
So we have to get up on the highway and
actually race down the highway with the

254
00:07:58,861 --> 00:07:59,430
traffic.

255
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,540
As bud was alluding to,

256
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,410
there is no rules.

257
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,030
The highways wide open,

258
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,410
the race is wide open.

259
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,273
There's cattle,

260
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,240
there's horses,

261
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,403
there's a,

262
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,820
are they speed limits on the highway?

263
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,170
Now there are,

264
00:08:10,171 --> 00:08:11,004
there didn't use to be.

265
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,351
Yeah,

266
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:12,041
they didn't use to be.

267
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:12,760
Now you know,

268
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,900
we had sanctioning bodies.

269
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,730
The sport is growing a little bit and uh,

270
00:08:15,731 --> 00:08:15,871
you know,

271
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,590
the Mexican government
does want rob doing,

272
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,630
I can't do 130 miles
an hour on the highway.

273
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:20,464
He can,

274
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,370
they don't want him to do 139 so they've,

275
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,010
they've got us down to 60 but they,

276
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,910
it's sections.

277
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:25,923
It's really,

278
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,240
it's kind of like in
between rounds in a fight,

279
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:28,481
you know,

280
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,770
you get jumped on the highway,

281
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
you get time to relax a little bit,

282
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:32,200
get to take a drink of water,

283
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,490
you're crews and 60 miles an hour.

284
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:36,550
And then I had about five miles you'd
dump off from the dirt again and you're

285
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,630
just hauling ass in the dirt.

286
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,170
How fast do you go on the dirt?

287
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,780
The top speed that close to one 40.

288
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,660
Oh Jesus.

289
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,590
Yeah.

290
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:44,820
Yeah.

291
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:49,670
We go cross dry lakes hundred and
3,540 miles an hour through the whoops,

292
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:49,911
you know,

293
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:50,990
two and three foot whoops.

294
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:55,620
Like waves anywhere from 60 all
the way up to 120 across them.

295
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,610
It's an incredible thing.

296
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,130
The,

297
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,830
the wheel travel of these trucks is,

298
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,101
you know,

299
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:00,570
over 20 inches in the front,

300
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,040
over 30 inches in the rear.

301
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,800
The tires that we have are 39 inches tall.

302
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,960
They cost a lot of money.

303
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,990
Luckily both bud and I or
spa supported by BF Goodrich.

304
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:10,890
Um,

305
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,910
it's an incredible,

306
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:12,810
incredible sport.

307
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,220
And like bud was saying,

308
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,420
when he got involved with it,

309
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:16,320
he fell in love with it.

310
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,770
And I did the same thing back in the
early eighties and I'm addicted to it.

311
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:20,610
Um,

312
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,510
the ball 1000,

313
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:22,770
it only comes once a year.

314
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,730
He tried to win it.

315
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,511
If you don't get it done,

316
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:26,220
you got to wait another 365 days.

317
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:27,210
You get down there and do it again.

318
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,221
And uh,

319
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:28,371
it,

320
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:28,651
it's,

321
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,080
it's an awesome feeling and you can't
wait to get down there and do it.

322
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,400
So these trucks,

323
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:36,710
they have like some sort of
special suspension on them
where each wheel is kind

324
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:40,770
of independent and they have a lot of
wheel travel so they can hit these big

325
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:45,771
crazy bumps and it's still kind of
keeps the thing fairly levels that the,

326
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,110
the idea of mindset.

327
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,911
Absolutely.

328
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:48,990
Got a great analogy there.

329
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:49,170
Yeah.

330
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:49,620
They're,

331
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,690
the front suspension is a arm independent.

332
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,430
The rear is actually straight axle,

333
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:53,971
but,

334
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:54,091
uh,

335
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:54,510
with,

336
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:54,930
you know,

337
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,300
shocks that are four and
a half inches in diameter,

338
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,700
coil springs that are
five inches in diameter.

339
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,660
Uh,

340
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,493
the trucks,

341
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,431
they work really,

342
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,600
really well over the bumps.

343
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,891
They're amazing.

344
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:05,910
When you watch them on video,

345
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:10,500
you see the wheels just flopping around
like they're just just super loose and a

346
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,160
credible thing that
it's absolutely amazing.

347
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:14,641
Yeah,

348
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,241
they have,

349
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:15,720
um,

350
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,110
I know dodge makes a
truck that's just like a,

351
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:24,111
a purpose built off road truck that
they sell for like civilians for it for

352
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,440
instance.

353
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,760
Truck.

354
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,600
Well I know Ford makes the raptor right,

355
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,250
but dodge dodge makes a,

356
00:10:29,251 --> 00:10:31,710
an even more hardcore
version of it for the ram.

357
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,010
You guys are shaking it
not just be for people.

358
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:34,650
No,

359
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,070
no.

360
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:38,720
We just know the truck industry and
both rob and I were in an early stage to

361
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,630
develop with the raptor.

362
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,040
I raised her APP to know eight.

363
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,730
Rob was in the early development of,

364
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:45,650
of the other raptor testing and we just
had that conversation about testing

365
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,400
Borrego we,

366
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,760
we know the truck market pretty well.

367
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,690
Dodge has nothing that they've tried
to duplicate it is what they've done.

368
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:51,891
There's,

369
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,550
there's some something
called the ram runner.

370
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:53,701
Yeah,

371
00:10:53,701 --> 00:10:54,181
exactly.

372
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:54,421
There's a,

373
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:54,751
Jamie,

374
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,501
pull up the video.

375
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,810
Dodd raptor versus Ram runner,

376
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:58,770
head to head.

377
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,350
This is what I'm referring to.

378
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,860
I saw a video online that was a,

379
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,860
have you driven one of those yet?

380
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,500
No,

381
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,400
I've driven the raptor a lot and
now they're an incredible vehicle.

382
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:08,760
Um,

383
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,720
and I know they're pretty
cool that you could buy them.

384
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,730
Like really?

385
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,620
I mean it's,

386
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,400
it's amazing to be able to
go to the Ford dealer and,

387
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,350
and get a truck that is capable
of doing what the Ford Raptor is.

388
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:19,481
I'm,

389
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:20,281
I'm blown away.

390
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,190
I've been in the offered
industry for a long time and uh,

391
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,720
it's absolutely incredible with the,

392
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:25,980
with the raptor can do.

393
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,401
Yeah.

394
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:27,810
Our neighbor has one of these things.

395
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,330
Use it to go get groceries
and see that's the,

396
00:11:30,331 --> 00:11:31,120
uh,

397
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,200
the difference between
them is that the raptor,

398
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,470
apparently I've watched the video of
the raptor is more comfortable driving

399
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:37,921
around.

400
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,480
You could actually use
it as a regular car.

401
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:43,380
Where's the ram runner is much more like,

402
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,070
you know,

403
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,090
one of these things.

404
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,580
Something that you really
wouldn't drive on the street.

405
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:47,821
Yeah.

406
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:48,330
The railroad.

407
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:48,931
I don't know what it is.

408
00:11:48,931 --> 00:11:49,201
I mean,

409
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,470
it's probably aftermarket are purpose
built by a third party or a second stage

410
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,050
manufacturer.

411
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,411
It's not,

412
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:53,680
I don't,

413
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,250
I mean,

414
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,100
so it's not like as
mainstream as the raptor,

415
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,271
they,

416
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:57,911
they run,

417
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,050
they run and I've talked to them,

418
00:11:59,051 --> 00:11:59,950
I've been at the plant,

419
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:03,130
they run like eight fon fifties and
then they throw it wrapped in there,

420
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:04,720
eight one F-150 he's put a raptor,

421
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:05,231
I mean it's a,

422
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:06,760
it's a real production vehicle.

423
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,290
So I high number production vehicle,

424
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,850
that was what my point was going to be.

425
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:11,650
It's like this is become this,

426
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,670
this type of racing.

427
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,150
It's become so popular that the,

428
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,220
it's sort of bleeding over
into the commercial market.

429
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:18,331
The,

430
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:18,560
the,

431
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,500
the regular domesticated human beings
are buying these trucks that they could

432
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:28,300
just drive out into the desert and go
fucking go crazy and hit bumps with,

433
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:28,581
yeah,

434
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,840
I used to see,

435
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,700
we call,

436
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:30,890
you know,

437
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,670
the flat billers,

438
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,503
you know,

439
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,880
mimicking the off road
truck by an arranger,

440
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,260
putting fiberglass fenders on it,

441
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:36,891
raising it up,

442
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:37,724
lowering it.

443
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,331
And I think,

444
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:38,570
uh,

445
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:38,781
you know,

446
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,100
Ford Motor Company saw that.

447
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:40,761
It's like,

448
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:40,911
hey,

449
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:43,460
we should build something that you
can just buy right off the lot.

450
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:43,531
And,

451
00:12:43,531 --> 00:12:46,960
and they did that I think a
2008 but and I both went to,

452
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,430
got invited to go to the out,

453
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,710
do some testing with the
raptor and blown away by it.

454
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,070
And then they came on the showroom and
you're capable of buying those things for

455
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,990
under $50,000.

456
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,150
So it's an incredible vehicle.

457
00:12:59,510 --> 00:12:59,961
Yeah,

458
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:00,890
they're fast as shit.

459
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,860
Two right at six to the six is really
fast and motor I loader is incredible.

460
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:05,850
I'd beat the crap out of it.

461
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,450
And our race,

462
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,260
um,

463
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,140
did 103 hundred five
across the Diablo lake bed.

464
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:10,650
Um,

465
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,250
it's an amazing thing.

466
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,083
Motor oil,

467
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,460
that's a stock motor t
that's not even pumped up.

468
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,290
My trophy trucks got 900 horsepower.

469
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,290
That's why we can do for one 40 split

470
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,140
900 horsepower.

471
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:22,620
Yeah,

472
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,200
they're there now they're there.

473
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,670
They probably weigh full of gas.

474
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,890
105 gallons of gas gets
about two miles a gallon.

475
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,970
900 horsepower,

476
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,980
39 still touch five gallons
of gas driving a bomb.

477
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,330
In order to get anywhere.

478
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,000
In order to get anywhere you've
got to have that much gas.

479
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,770
Cause the two miles a gallon
you won't get very far.

480
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,320
It really like it's two miles
to the gallon pretty much.

481
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:44,190
That's about the average.

482
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,160
That is hilarious.

483
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,420
That's hilarious.

484
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:50,340
You have a two mile to the gallon car.

485
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,340
Wow.

486
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,540
900 horsepower.

487
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,403
It is a bomb.

488
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,303
It's the bomb.

489
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,690
900 horsepower.

490
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,830
100 and how many gallons?

491
00:13:58,831 --> 00:13:59,090
How many?

492
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,210
Hundred and five gallons.

493
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,560
Wow.

494
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,340
That's crazy.

495
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,120
So um,

496
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,290
how long can that get you?

497
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,060
Like when you,

498
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,360
it's not always two miles,

499
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:06,571
right?

500
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,250
Like when you're on the
highway going 60 days,

501
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,240
it'll go up to eight.

502
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:09,601
Yeah,

503
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:10,920
it'll go up to price six.

504
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,783
Whoa.

505
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,691
Crazy.

506
00:14:12,691 --> 00:14:12,980
We,

507
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,230
we,

508
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,800
we tried to,

509
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,160
we tried to go anywhere from a,

510
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:15,410
you know,

511
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,930
a hundred 175 miles to
two 25 on a tank of gas.

512
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,820
I'm with 900 horsepower at the tires.

513
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:22,800
Can't go a whole lot farther
when you out there in the desert,

514
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,260
spinning them and it just starts
tearing the rubber off of him.

515
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:25,920
And two,

516
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,170
do you have spares in the back or do
you have pitstops do you guys both?

517
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:29,551
Both.

518
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:31,560
We carry two spare tires on the back,

519
00:14:31,561 --> 00:14:32,670
but we have to,

520
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:32,941
yeah,

521
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:33,774
just to,

522
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:34,350
but every,

523
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,010
every,

524
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,240
you know,

525
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,060
175,

526
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,020
225 miles,

527
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,610
we have a full on fuel pit.

528
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,080
We pull in there and stop.

529
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:40,520
They'll put,

530
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:40,740
you know,

531
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,340
a hundred gallons of gas for get it filled
back up and change the rear tires on

532
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:44,791
the truck.

533
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,860
And then if we happen to
have a flat in between spots,

534
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,311
you know,

535
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:47,550
they'll,

536
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,730
they'll rerock another tire.

537
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,430
So we pretty much have that plan to
race up and down the Baja peninsula.

538
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,750
That's about 1100 mile race will stop
every 200 miles if we do the shorter loop

539
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:57,584
races,

540
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:57,891
um,

541
00:14:57,891 --> 00:15:01,700
anywhere from 250 to 500 miles
or the other races go halfway,

542
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,010
do tires and fuel and hit it.

543
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:04,851
So Bud,

544
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:05,684
when we did,

545
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,940
for folks who don't know bud produced,

546
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,410
he's produced Jesus Christ.

547
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,330
A hundred shows me how
many shows you produced,

548
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,531
produced,

549
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:13,470
overhauling,

550
00:15:13,471 --> 00:15:16,460
and rides and rides.

551
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:17,241
When we did that.

552
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,074
Barracuda,

553
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:18,361
the,

554
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:18,681
the,

555
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:20,930
the silver Barracuda that
we mean that was what,

556
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,540
like 2004 or five or since 2005.

557
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:23,750
Yeah.

558
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,490
So that was like right around
the year that you were,

559
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,450
you were beginning to rate

560
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,320
yep.

561
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,071
Right around the time.

562
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:28,640
And I loved,

563
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,400
I loved Jujitsu and I love all the
stuff that we used to train together.

564
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,330
And this is Kinda my new,

565
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,350
my next new passion.

566
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,480
I always had to figure out
what something new and crazy.

567
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:35,710
Yeah.

568
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,710
I'm going to go to Antarctica,

569
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:37,790
I'm going to climb Mt.

570
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:37,791
Everest.

571
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,990
I'm going to go do something stupid.

572
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,190
This is my something stupid.

573
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:41,150
It was really just a,

574
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,700
I had so many TV shows
on the air at the time.

575
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,751
My sponsors like,

576
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:44,871
hey,

577
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:47,420
we want to treat you once you go down
and doing the stupid celebrity race.

578
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,100
And then I just haven't returned.

579
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:49,830
Well Bud was,

580
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,700
so for folks who don't know was one of
the owners of the king of the cage back

581
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:54,890
in the day and button.

582
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,800
I mad at Jujitsu.

583
00:15:55,801 --> 00:16:00,300
We trained at John Joc Machado's are
both students at John jocks and um,

584
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,210
you are always involved in a
bunch of fucking nutty shit.

585
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:05,370
You're always off doing something.

586
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,300
Looney tunes.

587
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:07,350
But this one man,

588
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,760
this one's stuck like glue,

589
00:16:08,761 --> 00:16:09,900
this Baja thing.

590
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:10,621
Boy,

591
00:16:10,621 --> 00:16:14,280
you would get this look in your eye
like a fucking junkie when you'd start

592
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:15,130
talking about like a,

593
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,830
like a crazed crackhead.

594
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,840
Just look to get that next fix.

595
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,590
And He came jockey,

596
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,680
I'm sure that 900 horsepower car flying
around and going 140 miles an hour or

597
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,070
bumps.

598
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,360
It is nothing like you've ever seen.

599
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:29,481
No,

600
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:30,800
you have to like,

601
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,990
I talked to people like a new,

602
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,870
a good friend of mine.

603
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,530
Um,

604
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,240
Andrew Hendricks,

605
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,050
he raced Fcca for years,

606
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:36,261
right?

607
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:36,850
So He's,

608
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,300
he's got,

609
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,250
he's got his Mustang,

610
00:16:38,251 --> 00:16:39,051
he's got an Audi,

611
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,640
he's racing Scca and uh,

612
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,640
the American Le Mans series and
they're fast and he's loving it.

613
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,230
He took one riding a trophy truck,

614
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,160
sold his stuff,

615
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,380
and he's got five trophy trucks
now and he's gonna start racing.

616
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:50,060
So flat ground got boring.

617
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:52,190
Flat ground always gets point
going around with a fucking circle.

618
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,030
It's stupid.

619
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,170
It's you going around a circle.

620
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,890
You're going,

621
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,670
I left,

622
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,503
left

623
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,140
bad for your brain,

624
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,820
like bouncing up and down.

625
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,500
I talked to a guy who's an
expert in a lot of shit.

626
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,430
Bad for your brain.

627
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,301
That's what I'm saying.

628
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:07,920
My whole life I'm looking at my whole law,

629
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:09,090
my choices and my God,

630
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:09,924
it's amazing.

631
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,160
I've talked for a living.

632
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:12,970
What don't,

633
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,670
I'm not sure if there's
anything I don't do.

634
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,200
It is not bad for my brain.

635
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,210
But the bouncing around,

636
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:23,211
apparently he was telling me that even
just jet skiing like or waterskiing like

637
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,610
getting pulled behind a boat
and bouncing up and down.

638
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,300
He's like,

639
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,560
that's really bad for your brain.

640
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,340
Like you.

641
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,800
There's nowhere in nature where you like,

642
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,150
did he,

643
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,140
did he hit water and have your
head snap up and down like that.

644
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,780
And he's like in nature it's like what?

645
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:42,150
Running maybe the occasional jump.

646
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,260
You jump over things.

647
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,060
You're avoiding animals
that are trying to eat you.

648
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,310
Yeah,

649
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,461
yeah,

650
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:45,590
yeah.

651
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,910
But you,

652
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,930
you know the human
body's an amazing thing.

653
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:48,141
Right?

654
00:17:48,141 --> 00:17:49,380
So my very first race,

655
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,130
I

656
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,160
don't think I could feel my neck or my
head for about three days afterwards.

657
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,220
My neck was so sore and I at the time,

658
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:58,220
and I've actually been a lot
smarter and technologies,

659
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,550
they gave me the heaviest,

660
00:17:59,580 --> 00:17:59,971
oldest,

661
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:00,900
crappiest helmet.

662
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:04,140
It must have weighed six pounds and here
put this on and then it was in the car

663
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:07,500
for 36 hours with this helmet on and I
thought my head was going to come off.

664
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:08,970
You get a Mike Tyson neck from that.

665
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:09,301
Yeah.

666
00:18:09,301 --> 00:18:10,134
So your body,

667
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,993
your workout.

668
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,581
I do.

669
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:13,020
I do for training for thing.

670
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:17,970
I put a 25 pound plate on my head and
I'm not kidding because I believe you,

671
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,741
you got to you,

672
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:22,330
your body starts to evolve and could
absorb that and you actually do.

673
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,200
And the thing that helps you the
most is you is you're almost like a,

674
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,220
like a drunk driving.

675
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,263
You just relax.

676
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,260
Do you seat belts?

677
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,340
It just fucking relax.

678
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,920
You know you always put like rob
and I will go take guys for a ride.

679
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,820
We do on occasion,

680
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,051
they're over on this,

681
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:37,150
on the holy shit bar and their tents and
there are so tense and there were seat

682
00:18:37,151 --> 00:18:38,850
belts or sucked and stop breathing too.

683
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,200
Yeah.

684
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,630
And the,

685
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,441
and they suck.

686
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:41,120
They're there.

687
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,600
Um,

688
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,510
we actually took a seal team.

689
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:46,740
Guy was on my team and oh nine but he
put his seat belt so tight it like start

690
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:48,960
hurting their Clavel your
clavicle start crushing down.

691
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,000
You're stirred and Ms. Turner
starts separating from your chest.

692
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,631
And I'm not kidding.

693
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,020
He's like,

694
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,890
I think my heart hurts.

695
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:53,161
I'm like,

696
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:53,994
man,

697
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,893
I swear to God.

698
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,130
Am I joking?

699
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,400
No,

700
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,091
absolutely not.

701
00:18:57,091 --> 00:18:57,800
My heart hurts.

702
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,680
I think it hurt my heart.

703
00:18:58,681 --> 00:18:58,891
I'm like,

704
00:18:58,891 --> 00:18:59,251
no,

705
00:18:59,251 --> 00:18:59,671
you just,

706
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,510
what happens is you really,

707
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,550
you push so much on the clavicle down,

708
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,520
sucking down and your chest
is operating your ribs.

709
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,201
You just separating,

710
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,320
descending your sternum out.

711
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,140
So like the area that they cut up and
when they give you open heart surgery,

712
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,981
it starts separating,

713
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:11,940
gets carved the dry here.

714
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:12,990
And I'm like,

715
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,220
you're not having a heart attack.

716
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,960
You just put your things to come on Pussy,

717
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,083
get out of it.

718
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:18,750
You know,

719
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,790
I took Josh Barnett two years ago.

720
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,540
Yeah.

721
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,980
I know a lot of MMA guys do.

722
00:19:22,981 --> 00:19:23,820
It doesn't apple,

723
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:24,391
Eric Apple,

724
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:25,590
he goes down there a lot.

725
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:25,940
No,

726
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,270
he's been down there a lot.

727
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:28,380
He does short court racing.

728
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,790
Um,

729
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,010
for,

730
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,191
yeah,

731
00:19:29,191 --> 00:19:30,024
he did short course,

732
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,990
a lot of racing.

733
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:33,120
He told me he was involved
with some horrible,

734
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:33,930
horrible wreck.

735
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,531
It was bad.

736
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:34,681
Yeah,

737
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,041
he did.

738
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:35,761
He did a nose.

739
00:19:35,761 --> 00:19:36,121
Did you see?

740
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:37,170
I think it was like Elsinore.

741
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:37,711
He was in that,

742
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,310
um,

743
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:41,310
west coast chill and went
over and over and over.

744
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:41,641
And He,

745
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:42,060
uh,

746
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,240
yeah,

747
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,630
he uh,

748
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,070
he got blood in his eye
and got all the Funky,

749
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,520
he'd say the same execution or leading,

750
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:47,970
yeah.

751
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,803
Head bleeding.

752
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,740
And he was,

753
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,341
he's a novice.

754
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:52,530
He's a great friend of mine and
he's an obvious and race as much.

755
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,040
Um,

756
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:53,341
but yeah,

757
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:53,651
that was [inaudible].

758
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,810
He's another fucking nut.

759
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:55,050
Right.

760
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,410
I mean,

761
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,170
he started out his career
doing motorcycle racing,

762
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,280
a motorcycle racing,

763
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,550
and then got into MMA and now
another crazy adrenaline junkie.

764
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,360
Yup.

765
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:03,900
The,

766
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,100
the idea behind this is
all based on competition.

767
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,780
And just one of the things
we were talking about,

768
00:20:09,781 --> 00:20:11,520
like there's very little money in this.

769
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,141
Yeah.

770
00:20:13,141 --> 00:20:14,120
For for it.

771
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:15,000
It's really,

772
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,600
you know,

773
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:15,810
it,

774
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,660
it's a beautiful sport because you don't
really have to have a lot on lending to

775
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:19,650
get in certain classes.

776
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,640
And then there's the,

777
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:21,990
like the upper echelon clash,

778
00:20:21,991 --> 00:20:23,760
like Rob's class and there's not an,

779
00:20:23,761 --> 00:20:24,594
I'll stop talking to him.

780
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,760
There's not a lot of money into it,

781
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,010
but I don't think there's a lot
how much money's in yacht racing.

782
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,720
I mean there's all the really big sports
or things that are on a bucket list.

783
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,290
You know,

784
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,150
there's not a lot of money and
climbing all met at Mount Everest.

785
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,340
It's actually cost you 25
grand if you want to go do it,

786
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:38,480
you,

787
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:38,670
you,

788
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,260
it's just one of those
things you have to go do.

789
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,920
Right.

790
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,880
It's passion driven.

791
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,360
I mean,

792
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,410
we get addicted to it.

793
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,010
It's like a drug and we end up spending
everything that we have to do it.

794
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,840
The smaller cars,

795
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,661
the small classes,

796
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:49,960
the,

797
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,930
the run anywhere from 20
to 50 grand trophy trucks.

798
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:56,830
Like I drive their $500,000
to go $500,000 truck.

799
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,640
Yup.

800
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,211
Oh my God.

801
00:20:58,211 --> 00:20:59,110
Should pull up a picture.

802
00:20:59,111 --> 00:20:59,471
One of those.

803
00:20:59,471 --> 00:20:59,761
What,

804
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:00,930
what would he looked for it?

805
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,440
A trophy trucks?

806
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,620
No,

807
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,600
just to Robin [inaudible]
one in your site.

808
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,750
[inaudible] dot com you'll pull it up.

809
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,600
And you know for me too is there's a
mystique around Baja for some reason.

810
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,131
It all based,

811
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:13,311
you know,

812
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:13,670
you go,

813
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,700
the essence of cool is that
because you're trying to,

814
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:19,720
is you're trying to figure yourself out
in your twenties and your thirties and

815
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:21,250
you look and you look
back at Steve Mcqueen,

816
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:24,790
guys like Steve McQueen and James Garner
and all these other cool Paul Newman.

817
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,780
They all race the race.

818
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,311
I mean they,

819
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:28,660
they did this race before and they
went down there and they raised,

820
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,230
they raised,

821
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,420
I mean McQueen almost
one in a couple of times.

822
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,080
Really.

823
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,500
Um,

824
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,120
Paul Newman race day when he was 80,

825
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,680
he was 80 within their race.

826
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,873
I mean these,

827
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,330
these cool guys be what
killed him and yeah,

828
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,233
poor bastard.

829
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,760
These cool guys wanted to
go down there and race.

830
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,380
So there's a cool mystique to it.

831
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,840
I mean the list of celebrities and
people want to go down there and race.

832
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,683
It's just interesting.

833
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:48,731
Yeah,

834
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:52,870
I guess it's a very strange
thing that this has become.

835
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,980
So is that the truck?

836
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,281
Yeah,

837
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:54,610
that's,

838
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:55,540
that's actually an image.

839
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,150
You're a trophy truck.

840
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,930
That's actually a short core struck there.

841
00:21:58,931 --> 00:21:59,431
That's I,

842
00:21:59,431 --> 00:22:00,610
I do short course racing too.

843
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,540
That's a pro too.

844
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,470
Um,

845
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,820
why is there a naked girl next to you?

846
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,720
Does she raise with you?

847
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,950
That would make racing better?

848
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,813
Absolutely.

849
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,440
That's a rockstar.

850
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,200
The image always have the
ladies in the posters.

851
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:11,441
Oh,

852
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:12,730
rockstar energy drink.

853
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,920
Yeah.

854
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,800
Like one of those dudes,

855
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:15,890
like I'm a rock star.

856
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,990
I'm out there driving around him.

857
00:22:16,991 --> 00:22:17,620
A rock star.

858
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,380
Now he's the most humble driver lab.

859
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,500
There's a lot of guys out there.

860
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,240
I just wanted to let people
know who just listening.

861
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,560
A lot of people watch this.

862
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,210
More people listen and watch it.

863
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,110
So the idea behind it came
when like what year did this,

864
00:22:29,111 --> 00:22:29,411
this,

865
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:31,240
this race get created?

866
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,110
I don't know,

867
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,591
probably in the,

868
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:34,620
in the early sixties when
I hear my version of,

869
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,473
yeah,

870
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,880
and then I'll fix it.

871
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,420
I read once now,

872
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:41,840
uh,

873
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,080
in,

874
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,940
in 62,

875
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:43,890
I'll tell you exactly the,

876
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,040
the,

877
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,680
the how it happened is 62 of the Honda
Motor Company decided that they were

878
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:47,861
going to,

879
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,330
they're going to put out to enduro bikes,

880
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:49,660
right?

881
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,530
1962,

882
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:51,901
Steve McQueen,

883
00:22:51,901 --> 00:22:52,690
stunt guy.

884
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,200
Um,

885
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,340
his name's Dave Eakins.

886
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:56,620
Bud Eakins was his stunt
double in a lot of the races,

887
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:57,454
and I'll make this short.

888
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,360
They said,

889
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,490
how are we going to test these
bike and market to Americans?

890
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,520
These guys are just racers and
idiots and they wanted to go,

891
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:04,061
okay,

892
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:04,780
we're going to go,

893
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,770
we're getting swear to God.

894
00:23:05,771 --> 00:23:06,580
This is what happened.

895
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,870
They went in 1962,

896
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,280
they went to Tijuana,

897
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,420
they went to western union,

898
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,990
they timestamp a card and they went down
to La Paz and they timestamp the cart,

899
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,221
no navigation,

900
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:15,821
no nothing.

901
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:17,380
And it made the Baja peninsula.

902
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,660
That was the very first run in the 60s.

903
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:20,711
That happened.

904
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:21,491
And then all of a sudden,

905
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:22,420
so they did a time,

906
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,171
it's kind of like,

907
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:24,004
you know,

908
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,240
you know the gumball rally,

909
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,540
this is like the gumball rally
but on dirt with a huge car.

910
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,190
So they did their rally and
then they post at a time.

911
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,860
It's like we did that in 35 minutes.

912
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,350
So then somebody else
came back or 35 hours,

913
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:35,720
sorry.

914
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,870
They think somebody
else came back to this.

915
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:37,181
Okay,

916
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:37,361
wait,

917
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:38,171
well we can beat that.

918
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:39,370
So they didn't 32 hours.

919
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,000
And if you look at the heritage of
people going down there and saying,

920
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,051
I can beat that.

921
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:45,980
And then truck started
going there and then cars

922
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,970
started going down there.

923
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:48,440
And then in 67,

924
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:49,040
there was,

925
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:49,873
there was a race.

926
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,050
60,

927
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:51,771
67,

928
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:52,281
there was a race.

929
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,890
The Nora right was the
first Nora and then,

930
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:55,370
um,

931
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,170
an icon my world,

932
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:57,580
right.

933
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:57,770
Uh,

934
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,280
Mickey Thompson who's an icon of motor
sports for everything that he's done,

935
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,990
a land speed and off road and everything.

936
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:03,560
He,

937
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,270
the guy that drove the rocket car.

938
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:05,691
Yeah,

939
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:06,021
he did.

940
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:06,270
He,

941
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:06,651
he drove,

942
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:07,830
he built land speed records.

943
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:08,690
Yeah,

944
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,411
he did every,

945
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:10,340
he's like Mickey,

946
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:12,510
Mickey Thompson in the motor
sports world is just a,

947
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,390
it's just a genius.

948
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,440
It was like he just to kind of
a pioneer and a lot of ways,

949
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,710
he was always like ahead of the game.

950
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:21,890
He was always building and pioneering
something before it's time.

951
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,830
Him and Perlman got together
and said let's do a race.

952
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:25,250
So they,

953
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,320
they started off in Tiawana and there
was a couple hundred guys there.

954
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,000
There is,

955
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,320
I mean Gardner was in there.

956
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,650
Uh,

957
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,490
Steve McQueen wasn't,

958
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:32,121
there were guys,

959
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:32,730
I'm not kidding.

960
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,740
We've had shoulder pads,

961
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:34,221
like football,

962
00:24:34,221 --> 00:24:35,300
shoulder pads on,

963
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,220
on a motorcycle drop the
flag and they all go wow.

964
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:40,851
Wow.

965
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:42,620
So that's what started it all off yet.

966
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,170
It's still wild frontier and it's,

967
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,013
I'm telling you there's,

968
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,520
there's no rules.

969
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,450
Someone's in your way.

970
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,160
You Hawk nicely,

971
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,820
nicely.

972
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,541
And if they don't move,

973
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,374
you move them.

974
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,610
Like you pump them and let
you run into them with cars.

975
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,473
Yes.

976
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,280
So humans are cars.

977
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:00,200
You're running into humans
or you're running into cars,

978
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,800
cars,

979
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,141
cars.

980
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:01,974
It depends on the day.

981
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,490
But for me it's cars.

982
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,320
Try not to run into humans.

983
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:07,154
That's not it.

984
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,250
But you told me that

985
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,430
there's a lot of shenanigans
that go on with like the locals,

986
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:15,820
like the locals know that this
event is going to take place.

987
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:17,110
A lot of what we talked about,

988
00:25:17,111 --> 00:25:19,120
we talked about before we
went on live on the air,

989
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,360
but besides the fact that
they try to touch the cars,

990
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:24,520
like if you see the videos like um,

991
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,450
I don't know how much,

992
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,980
how much of this stuff can we show?

993
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,480
We can't play the music.

994
00:25:28,481 --> 00:25:29,310
Is that what it is?

995
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:29,461
No,

996
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,510
you can play all the other ones.

997
00:25:30,511 --> 00:25:30,780
The other,

998
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,980
the other videos I sent you.

999
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,760
Um,

1000
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,210
there's,

1001
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,320
here's a video right here.

1002
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:34,700
Yeah.

1003
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,050
It's look how wide that fucking thing is.

1004
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,970
It's about 92 inches wide,

1005
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:42,150
which is about 15 inches
wider than a normal truck.

1006
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:45,330
And then we are going across
the dry lake about one 30.

1007
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,650
And that's your trophy truck?

1008
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,550
That's a trophy truck.

1009
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,690
That's bog California.

1010
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:48,871
Oh,

1011
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:49,920
that looks fun.

1012
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,203
It is fun.

1013
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,340
Look how close those people get.

1014
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:53,551
Yeah.

1015
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,360
Down there in Baja.

1016
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,701
I mean the,

1017
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,580
this is the biggest sport that they have.

1018
00:25:56,581 --> 00:25:56,721
And,

1019
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,660
and they,

1020
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,330
they wait year round for us
to come down there and they,

1021
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,110
they have uh,

1022
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:01,320
you know,

1023
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,370
such a huge passion for it.

1024
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:02,791
Like I do.

1025
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,740
They at times they want
to touch the truck.

1026
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,290
Well you'll go by and you'll see him
trying to reach out and grab the truck.

1027
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,520
Some of the other things they,

1028
00:26:08,521 --> 00:26:13,140
the shenanigans they do is a build
jumps booby traps we call them.

1029
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,650
And they,

1030
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,390
they crashed a lot of cars.

1031
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:17,850
But what they're doing is they
want to see the excitement.

1032
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,540
They want to see the truck or the buggy
hit the jump and fly through the air and

1033
00:26:21,541 --> 00:26:22,374
get pictures.

1034
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,360
One thing it's always funny
about Mexico is you see the,

1035
00:26:25,361 --> 00:26:26,010
they have the,

1036
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:31,010
the phone cameras and I think you can
piece together your whole race by them

1037
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,640
with their phone cameras.

1038
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,810
If they all post that,

1039
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,580
you could pretty much put
the whole race together,

1040
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:36,090
styles him.

1041
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,110
So I'll put it in perspective.

1042
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,120
So if,

1043
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,790
um,

1044
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,181
first of all,

1045
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,260
the Mexican people are amazing,

1046
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,470
they're amazing to us and it
sounds like I'm making for them,

1047
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:44,340
but they are innocent

1048
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,620
enough or they just
decide like they truly,

1049
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:47,940
and I had to learn this the hard way.

1050
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,950
I had a celebrity in my
car and I was driving,

1051
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,470
but it's just a random celebrity.

1052
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,671
No,

1053
00:26:53,671 --> 00:26:54,504
I had actually a chip.

1054
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,100
I had chip Foose with me and my car.

1055
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:56,790
Okay.

1056
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,460
And we're driving and I'm doing about 90,

1057
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,000
just a rate random dirt road.

1058
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,130
And I see a bunch of people over here.

1059
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,550
Right.

1060
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:02,821
Okay.

1061
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:03,870
I got to make sure to watch them,

1062
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:05,400
make sure they're not
darting out in front of me.

1063
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,820
And there's see some random people over
here with a fire and there's a lot of

1064
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:09,291
them and it's,

1065
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,670
it's dusk and they both have
fires on the side of this road.

1066
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,504
And I'm like,

1067
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,231
this is true.

1068
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,940
What does his fucking people
doing on the side of the rode?

1069
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,110
Boom.

1070
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,610
And I hit a telephone pole.

1071
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,810
They buried in the middle of the road,

1072
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,770
right.

1073
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,890
And I went up like this and I'm
coming down like at 90 miles an hour.

1074
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,160
I'm like,

1075
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,851
Oh fuck,

1076
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,020
this is going to be terrible.

1077
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:26,460
Luckily the car absorbed it.

1078
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,750
We nerfed in,

1079
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,190
bounced off and kept going.

1080
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,110
I didn't even see the telephone
pole cause I'm an idiot.

1081
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,750
I'm a Newbie and I'm looking
at a bunch of Mexicans over.

1082
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,680
There's a bunch of guys that's really
nice to these people coming out to see it.

1083
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,260
So they thought it was cute to set up
this booby trap just to watch people try

1084
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,000
to jump it and go flying through the air.

1085
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,570
Well I think,

1086
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:45,900
you know,

1087
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,820
I think the red necks would
do the same thing if you,

1088
00:27:47,821 --> 00:27:48,571
if you let,

1089
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:49,740
if you didn't have those fences,

1090
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,200
the date the Daytona 500
and they could actually,

1091
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:52,530
you know,

1092
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,520
fix the outcome.

1093
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,031
Like we're going to,

1094
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:55,860
we're going to see if Dale
junior could jump this car.

1095
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:56,370
Right?

1096
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,630
Oh for sure they would do it.

1097
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,980
But that's what it is in Mexico.

1098
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,130
There's no fences,

1099
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,970
there's no fences to keep it back there.

1100
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,690
They're able to go wherever they want.

1101
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,870
Well and the capabilities of these
trucks are pretty extraordinary.

1102
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:10,020
They're very different than
anything that a NASCAR car could do.

1103
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,250
They're not necessary.

1104
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,920
I have a belief because some people
throw bottles and shit like that,

1105
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:14,420
but I,

1106
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,820
they are not unnecessarily out to kill
us or hurt us because actually after the

1107
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:18,271
wreck us,

1108
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:19,104
they'll help us.

1109
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,680
I've had them rec rec before and a booby
trap and they'll roll the car over to

1110
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,030
help you fix a car with a welder.

1111
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:24,630
They'll get pimped,

1112
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,310
you change a tire and
they'll push you on your way.

1113
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,550
They not only throw bottles,

1114
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,510
but they throw rocks.

1115
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,400
Sometimes they thrown snakes in the cab
of the truck and thrown snakes in the

1116
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,890
cab of the truck to,

1117
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,501
you know,

1118
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:38,191
it didn't happen to me,

1119
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:40,980
but my partner it with mastercraft racing,

1120
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,180
he,

1121
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,950
he was coming in and it's an audit coming
to the finish at night and they know,

1122
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,430
yeah,

1123
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,570
Robbie Pierce from mastercraft,

1124
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,430
he got a snake thrown in the
cab of the truck and holy.

1125
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,910
Thankfully it's not me cause I
don't really care for snakes.

1126
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,810
What kind of snake?

1127
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,241
I don't,

1128
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:52,681
I don't know.

1129
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:56,290
I know [inaudible] is so non poisonous,

1130
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:59,850
you're driving 80 miles an hour to snake
kits there and you look down and it

1131
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:00,151
could be,

1132
00:29:00,151 --> 00:29:02,670
it might as well be a cobra at
that you're really hardcore.

1133
00:29:02,671 --> 00:29:05,610
You put in your teeth and you keep track

1134
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,890
at that point you just pull over
and get the fuck out of the car.

1135
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,580
So was technology developed specifically
for this race to figure out how to

1136
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,160
drive fast and hit those bumps?

1137
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:21,330
Cause this all,

1138
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:24,370
I mean I'm fairly ignorant to,

1139
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:24,961
I mean I've,

1140
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:25,161
I've,

1141
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:28,560
I kind of understand
suspensions a kind of see what,

1142
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:31,350
but it's pretty obvious when
I look at your trophy truck,

1143
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,681
there's this,

1144
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:33,360
some extraordinary equipment on that.

1145
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:33,661
Yeah,

1146
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:34,141
absolutely.

1147
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:34,271
It's,

1148
00:29:34,271 --> 00:29:35,550
it's developed over the years.

1149
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:35,821
You know,

1150
00:29:35,821 --> 00:29:36,510
like when it,

1151
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,990
when bud was telling
the story earlier about,

1152
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,560
but it started in the 60s they were
taking stock trucks down there,

1153
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,890
putting a little bit bigger tires on them,

1154
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,210
taking the windshields item,

1155
00:29:43,211 --> 00:29:44,170
stuff like that seat,

1156
00:29:44,171 --> 00:29:45,400
putting some extra seat belts in them.

1157
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,410
And now it's just developed into,

1158
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:48,041
you know,

1159
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,250
big tall tires that way.

1160
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,170
Tire and wheel probably
weighs 150 pounds a piece.

1161
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,590
Wow.

1162
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,760
Shocks $15,000 for a set
of shocks for the truck.

1163
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,751
Nine horsepower.

1164
00:29:58,751 --> 00:29:59,584
Like I said,

1165
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,130
uh,

1166
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,720
some of us has automatic trainees,

1167
00:30:01,721 --> 00:30:02,980
some of the manual trannies,

1168
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:03,790
um,

1169
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,623
lights,

1170
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,550
like a baseball stadium of KC lights as
a sponsor and run seven of them on the

1171
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:13,570
roof and 7:00 AM on the front bumper
and you can see a mile down the road and

1172
00:30:13,571 --> 00:30:14,590
light up the whole desert.

1173
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,850
And Wow.

1174
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,750
Over the years it's,

1175
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,081
you know,

1176
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,010
we keep developing,

1177
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:20,470
making things better and
it's the whole ego thing.

1178
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:24,010
You want to be the first one to La Paz
and you're constantly thinking about what

1179
00:30:24,011 --> 00:30:24,790
can you do,

1180
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,720
what can you make?

1181
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,730
What can you build to make it go faster?

1182
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,270
Well,

1183
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:28,690
go ahead.

1184
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:28,901
No,

1185
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:29,380
please.

1186
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:29,560
No,

1187
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,070
I mean,

1188
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,260
and there's an entire industry
that was spawned off of this.

1189
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:33,094
This is a halo,

1190
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,371
right?

1191
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:36,070
So trophy trucks and Baja
racing is a halo for any brand.

1192
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,120
It doesn't really matter what it is.

1193
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:37,690
We,

1194
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,820
we entertain brands like we sit forward,

1195
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:40,061
BF,

1196
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:40,600
Goodrich,

1197
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,433
Casey,

1198
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:41,780
they can,

1199
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,430
they can go down there and conquer Baja.

1200
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,201
Go pro,

1201
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:47,560
you name the company and they want to
go to Baja and they always come to me

1202
00:30:47,561 --> 00:30:47,940
cause I'm,

1203
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,930
I'm the media guy and they're
like how do we do this?

1204
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,710
I'm like I dunno,

1205
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,080
I'll hook up with a trophy truck and
we'll go beat the shit out of your product

1206
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:53,914
and see if it works.

1207
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,360
It's,

1208
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,010
there's a whole entire industry.

1209
00:30:57,011 --> 00:30:57,850
If you go to Sema,

1210
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:58,541
which is that big,

1211
00:30:58,541 --> 00:30:58,730
you know,

1212
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,860
aftermarket parts thing.

1213
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,640
There's an entire industry
which has dedicated off road
and the halo of off road

1214
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,170
is Baja 1000 racing.

1215
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,041
It's the halo.

1216
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:06,720
It doesn't really,

1217
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,553
do you know how,

1218
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,800
when you say it's the halo,

1219
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:09,634
what do you mean by that?

1220
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:09,831
Yeah,

1221
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:10,510
it's,

1222
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,790
it's really the pinnacle.

1223
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:12,611
If you,

1224
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:15,040
if you go to racing like Nascar or f one,

1225
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,680
you know the stuff is developed
and then trickles down.

1226
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:20,860
So there is a pass through from
everything that rob is complete because he

1227
00:31:20,861 --> 00:31:21,694
complains a lot.

1228
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,810
Everything that rob complaint,

1229
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:23,800
cause it's not fast enough,

1230
00:31:23,801 --> 00:31:24,640
it's not good enough.

1231
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,800
You get a 900 horsepower truck that goes
two miles to the gallon and he'll talk

1232
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:30,521
to his shot covers.

1233
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,240
I had a shot,

1234
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,640
I hit this bump one time
at 85 miles and I felt it.

1235
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,503
I felt it.

1236
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,410
I don't want to feel it.

1237
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,503
And I drive,

1238
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,260
I hit it all due respect.

1239
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:39,370
He drives a fucking pillow.

1240
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,550
I mean,

1241
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,383
I think it drives,

1242
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,891
it drives.

1243
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:44,590
So when you're going over
those crazy bumps and shit,

1244
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:46,130
you're fairly level nothing.

1245
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,470
He feels nothing

1246
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,100
you,

1247
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:48,500
you,

1248
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:48,731
you,

1249
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:49,780
you feel a little bit.

1250
00:31:49,781 --> 00:31:50,231
But it's,

1251
00:31:50,231 --> 00:31:51,011
it's incredible.

1252
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:51,140
It's,

1253
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,650
it's a analogy we have is just
like riding on a marshmallow.

1254
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:54,760
When you jump and you land,

1255
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,020
it's like just falling,

1256
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:57,520
like you're landing on a marshmallow.

1257
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,730
Wow.

1258
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,430
And that's the development
over all the years.

1259
00:32:00,431 --> 00:32:00,520
And,

1260
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:00,820
and,

1261
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,250
and thankfully I'm in
the trophy truck class,

1262
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:04,300
which is the elite class.

1263
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:05,590
I've worked my way up from the bottom,

1264
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,170
driven through them all and
definitely don't want to go back.

1265
00:32:08,171 --> 00:32:09,004
And thanks.

1266
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,653
Difference.

1267
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,430
The bottom ones,

1268
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,030
like what are the,

1269
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,990
how many classes are there?

1270
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,141
Well,

1271
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:14,440
there's,

1272
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:14,830
there's,

1273
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,480
there's more than 10 classes.

1274
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:16,960
There's,

1275
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,410
there's probably six or eight truck
classes and they're six or eight buggy

1276
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:22,830
classes and there's also
motorcycles and ATVs.

1277
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,520
Utvs all these,

1278
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,280
there ends up being over
20 classes at the bottom,

1279
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,114
1000 and,

1280
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,100
and they all compete
against their own class.

1281
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:32,440
They all started their own
time together against a clock.

1282
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:32,980
They don't,

1283
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,910
we're not racing.

1284
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,700
We were racing all together
the track the same time.

1285
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,260
But we're separated by start time.

1286
00:32:38,261 --> 00:32:39,470
So you're really racing clock.

1287
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:39,980
You do

1288
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,551
have traffic.

1289
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:41,750
You do have to get by the guys,

1290
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,890
um,

1291
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,220
to,

1292
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,090
to get the win.

1293
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,660
I'm so used to bud jumping.

1294
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,320
So when you're,

1295
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,900
when you're driving these things,

1296
00:32:56,901 --> 00:32:59,180
it's very different
than the cheaper trucks.

1297
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,133
Yeah.

1298
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,030
I want to say cheaper cause
none of them are cheap.

1299
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:03,440
But the different clouds,

1300
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,191
different classes.

1301
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,520
Cause you got an entry level class.

1302
00:33:05,521 --> 00:33:06,051
Exactly.

1303
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,660
You got to have your entry level
classes and there are a lot more stock.

1304
00:33:08,661 --> 00:33:09,351
They don't have as much.

1305
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:10,184
We'll travel.

1306
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,310
They got eight or 10 inches of wheel
travel and the truck's smaller tires.

1307
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,810
They're just a restricted a lot more
and those cars are a lot more difficult.

1308
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:18,650
They beat you up a lot more.

1309
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:21,120
They take a lot longer to get
down the down the peninsula.

1310
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,231
Yeah.

1311
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:22,220
That's what I was going to get at.

1312
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:23,690
So like when you first started out,

1313
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:25,070
you took much more of a beating.

1314
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:25,850
Absolutely.

1315
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,020
So now like that's,

1316
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:30,050
that's why you're into
these really cushy rides.

1317
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:30,771
Like you've been there,

1318
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:31,251
done that,

1319
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:31,551
been there,

1320
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:31,941
done that.

1321
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:33,290
I want to work my way up and,

1322
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:34,820
and get to the top of the sport.

1323
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm doing it for 30 years and I've
been in the elite class since the mid

1324
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:38,870
nineties.

1325
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,890
So this is a good vehicle
for the apocalypse except
for the fact that he uses so

1326
00:33:42,891 --> 00:33:43,724
much fuel.

1327
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,901
If you have gun,

1328
00:33:44,901 --> 00:33:45,734
you can get fuel.

1329
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
Yeah.

1330
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,960
We got to make your own fuel
at a certain point in time.

1331
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:49,850
You're not running diesel.

1332
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:50,090
Right.

1333
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,600
Yeah.

1334
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,190
See that's the problem.

1335
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,551
You know,

1336
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,320
Neil young makes his own diesel.

1337
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,020
I think Daryl Hannah makes her own ds.

1338
00:33:56,021 --> 00:33:57,730
A lot of vegetable oil and crap like that.

1339
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:58,310
Yeah.

1340
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,600
Well Neil Young,

1341
00:33:59,660 --> 00:33:59,860
uh,

1342
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,120
apparently has this gigantic farm.

1343
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,300
He has like a thousand plus Acre ranch
in northern California and he makes his

1344
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:12,650
own bio diesel and runs all his
vehicles off of his own gasoline.

1345
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,580
So he's called politely,

1346
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:14,630
totally off the grid.

1347
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,550
They like a conversion
on the old Mercedes.

1348
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,941
Yeah.

1349
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:19,430
You can do a conversion
on any kind of old car.

1350
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:19,860
Well,

1351
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,990
not even new cars.

1352
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:21,501
Apparently.

1353
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:23,870
You want to do conversions to biodiesel?

1354
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,003
Yeah.

1355
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:25,530
Yeah.

1356
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:25,851
We have to.

1357
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:26,601
We have to actually,

1358
00:34:26,601 --> 00:34:27,770
I was going to run one year.

1359
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:28,150
I was,

1360
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,060
I was working on that show.

1361
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:30,080
That picture of Jamie.

1362
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:30,800
What'd you put up?

1363
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,250
Neil Young's 59 Lincoln runs on
bio diesel and give me plugged in.

1364
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,450
Wow.

1365
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,753
I like that.

1366
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,733
That's pretty dope.

1367
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,220
I was working on a dealer.

1368
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,180
I was going to do a truck and
all electric truck down there.

1369
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,333
Oh,

1370
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,280
switching out gas.

1371
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,150
Is that possible?

1372
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,481
Yeah,

1373
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:45,110
it's possible.

1374
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:45,551
I mean the,

1375
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:48,980
the lithium batteries because
I was involved with a truck
company and then they,

1376
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:49,490
you know,

1377
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,690
my answer is very stuck.

1378
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:51,210
Like how,

1379
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,040
what can we do to market
this thing and read it?

1380
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,291
I don't really care what it is.

1381
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:54,660
It can be,

1382
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:54,990
right.

1383
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:55,880
It could be a mini bike.

1384
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:56,630
My answers race it.

1385
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,500
We should probably go race it.

1386
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:58,334
Right.

1387
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,863
I don't care.

1388
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,920
Could you do a,

1389
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,030
I mean is it feasible that you could
have enough battery power to do that?

1390
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:05,420
Sure.

1391
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,651
Yeah.

1392
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:06,890
In a tour could be amazing.

1393
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:07,680
That's why I want to do it.

1394
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,271
Torque on those.

1395
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:09,530
The Electric Motors are amazing.

1396
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,000
The problem is I don't think you would go.

1397
00:35:11,001 --> 00:35:11,660
Our pits,

1398
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,261
my pits,

1399
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:12,740
not his,

1400
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,620
my pits are about 120 miles apart
and that'd be hard to get there.

1401
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:15,831
Yeah.

1402
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:18,020
My Buddy Aubrey has one of those Teslas.

1403
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,380
Right.

1404
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,840
And the pickup is incredible.

1405
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Like I was really shocked
at how fast those things go.

1406
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:26,180
Like the zero to 60 in like four seconds.

1407
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,600
Right.

1408
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,330
It's bananas and it's weird
because there's no gears.

1409
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,490
It's just you're just going,

1410
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,470
it's not like man,

1411
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,863
it's just,

1412
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,830
it's very much like a space
ship and then you just,

1413
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,040
you hit the grass completely silent.

1414
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:41,281
I mean,

1415
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:43,590
you hear the tires rolling on the rubber,

1416
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,630
the rubber rolling on the
concrete and that's it.

1417
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:46,290
You don't,

1418
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,101
you don't hear anything.

1419
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,180
It's a very strange,

1420
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:51,250
that'd be a little bit scary
in Baja because the spectators,

1421
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,540
you're,

1422
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,730
they're used to here in the
race vehicle come into electric.

1423
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,810
They probably wouldn't hear it coming,

1424
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:55,001
right?

1425
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:55,070
Yeah,

1426
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,370
we can play that annoys Erica.

1427
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,920
We can play that polka music
or something like that.

1428
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,171
Yeah.

1429
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:59,004
There you go.

1430
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,350
Um,

1431
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,010
how many,

1432
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,930
you would have to have
so many batteries though.

1433
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,580
What I'm thinking is like a Tesla.

1434
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,170
If you go from the beginning
fully charged to the end,

1435
00:36:10,171 --> 00:36:11,760
you're getting like 300 miles I think.

1436
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:11,951
Yeah.

1437
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:13,090
But that's all I would need to do.

1438
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:13,900
We planned it out.

1439
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,260
It'd be 120 miles who charged.

1440
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,730
So we would,

1441
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,990
you build a carriage underneath,

1442
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:17,681
which are about seven,

1443
00:36:17,681 --> 00:36:20,230
800 pounds of batteries and
then you get to the next pit.

1444
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,600
You have a fully charged set of hours.

1445
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,540
You drop that carriage,

1446
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:23,350
put the carriage in,

1447
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,183
bolted back up.

1448
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,790
I'd be in my own class and I can
provide them whatever company was.

1449
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,150
Um,

1450
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,650
at the time it was a
company called Phoenix.

1451
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,290
I can provide them with a
Baja 1000 win as a market

1452
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,250
has I'm fully answered or
any of these other country,

1453
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,790
any of the other companies have ever
thought about doing something like that.

1454
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,640
Forward is amazing at it
because they do use Baja a lot.

1455
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,513
Last year,

1456
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,150
um,

1457
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,170
I raced a brand,

1458
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,200
the brand new F-150 the 2015 F-150 which
is a twin tube charged v six in the

1459
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:50,651
stock class.

1460
00:36:50,651 --> 00:36:54,940
That stock suspension stock everything
stock on the car it twin Turbo Charge v

1461
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:56,560
six and then we did the raptor together.

1462
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:57,311
I did the wrap to wait,

1463
00:36:57,311 --> 00:37:00,460
he was on the testing and I
raced the F-150 last last year.

1464
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,170
And when you race in F-150,

1465
00:37:02,171 --> 00:37:05,770
how much of it is different than what
you would borrow off the showroom floor?

1466
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,401
Nothing.

1467
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:07,120
Roll cage.

1468
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,890
We had we a fuel cell roll cage,

1469
00:37:08,891 --> 00:37:09,724
spare tire.

1470
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,810
That one I had,

1471
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,120
I had a radio and we had cup holders.

1472
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,350
I remember looking at some of the videos.

1473
00:37:14,351 --> 00:37:15,200
It's a cup holder in there.

1474
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,300
You can look it up online.

1475
00:37:16,301 --> 00:37:17,010
F-150 race,

1476
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,930
the Baja 1000 there's me and
you're going to laugh at me.

1477
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,070
That's it right there.

1478
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:21,800
Uh,

1479
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,210
no,

1480
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,350
that seems pretty different.

1481
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:23,480
No,

1482
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,313
it's different.

1483
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,243
Not,

1484
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,080
no.

1485
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,600
You'll see my,

1486
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:26,801
it's,

1487
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:30,970
it's the 2012 bond and they pissed me
off because I told them they did this to

1488
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:31,481
make me mad.

1489
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:31,900
But they haven't,

1490
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,340
they made me wear a white driving suit.

1491
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,141
Folks.

1492
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:36,040
You don't know bug.

1493
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:37,030
Where's bud?

1494
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,631
You're,

1495
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:39,730
you're the weirdest
fucking dude I've ever met.

1496
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:40,451
When it comes to clothes,

1497
00:37:40,451 --> 00:37:41,380
he'd go over Bud's house.

1498
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,030
He's got all black pants,

1499
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,020
all black shirts.

1500
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,820
His whole fucking wardrobe.

1501
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,400
His entire closet is black shirts,

1502
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,570
black pants,

1503
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,070
black tee shirts,

1504
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,001
black underwear,

1505
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:52,630
I'm assuming.

1506
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,110
Yeah.

1507
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:53,980
Black socks.

1508
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,790
Black socks.

1509
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,660
Black sneakers.

1510
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,200
Yup.

1511
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,030
He just doesn't want
to think about colors.

1512
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:58,660
No.

1513
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,610
So when they hit you with some white,

1514
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,760
did you wear it or did
you just get a marker?

1515
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,190
Sharp?

1516
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,640
I was,

1517
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,400
I was pretty up.

1518
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,160
Luckily I didn't have to get in
the car at the beginning and I am,

1519
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,441
the rain was,

1520
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:08,640
uh,

1521
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,850
the weather was pretty cold,

1522
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,040
so I had a black slicker.

1523
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,610
I put them on.

1524
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:15,810
So it rained on you and you rolled around
the dirt and you white drivers seat.

1525
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,280
I've been trying to get bud high for so
long to get them to smoke pot and I'm

1526
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:20,491
like,

1527
00:38:20,491 --> 00:38:23,190
the first thing you need to do is
throw away those fucking black clothes.

1528
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,140
You're going to go,

1529
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,390
wow,

1530
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,620
look at all these pretty colors.

1531
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:26,454
I could choose.

1532
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,740
Just let me get a skill.

1533
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:29,574
Let me get a little

1534
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,680
wearing pastels.

1535
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,600
You'll start enjoying different colors.

1536
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,790
Just start realizing how ridiculous
turned to an Andy Dick and you can wear

1537
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,770
pastels and shot Andy Dick.

1538
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:42,130
I'm saying you have an
appreciation for other colors.

1539
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,353
No,

1540
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,833
no.

1541
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,160
I think if I smoked pot,

1542
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:48,941
which I'm not going to,

1543
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:52,630
I'd be more into the dark lord world and
world and I'll have just maybe skulls

1544
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,200
in my tee shirts.

1545
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:53,741
Wow.

1546
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:54,760
You would get darker?

1547
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,480
Yeah.

1548
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,313
Okay.

1549
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,720
Now when you drive an F150,

1550
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,500
do you use like regular tires of like
you'd take tires that are right off of a

1551
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:03,334
showroom floor?

1552
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,410
We had the new BF Goodrich,

1553
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,270
k o two is that we raised on this,

1554
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,010
on this truck,

1555
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,010
normal suspension,

1556
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,800
regular F-150 suspension doc dude.

1557
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:15,020
We went hunting at to hone
ranch up in a northern,

1558
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:15,560
like a,

1559
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,840
it's near Bakersfield for TV,

1560
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:17,051
right?

1561
00:39:17,051 --> 00:39:17,411
You did that,

1562
00:39:17,411 --> 00:39:17,780
that team?

1563
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,070
No,

1564
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,750
this was a recent one.

1565
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:22,120
We went wild pig hunting to hone ranches.

1566
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:22,331
Uh,

1567
00:39:22,331 --> 00:39:23,350
this huge ranch.

1568
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:25,960
It's a 1,700,000 acres,

1569
00:39:25,961 --> 00:39:27,340
biggest ranch in California.

1570
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,510
Huge place.

1571
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,291
And uh,

1572
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:29,681
this guy,

1573
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:30,131
Cody,

1574
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:31,750
who was one of the guides there,

1575
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:36,370
one of the hunting guides drove us all
around an F150 and I'm ain't talking

1576
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,660
horrific terrain and this fucking
thing is driving over rocks and,

1577
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,450
and I,

1578
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,850
I was so impressed.

1579
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:43,241
I was like,

1580
00:39:43,241 --> 00:39:47,260
this is like one of the best commercials
for an F150 you could ever get.

1581
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,131
Just going to,

1582
00:39:48,131 --> 00:39:48,460
like,

1583
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,990
if you're thinking about
buying one of these things,

1584
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:54,070
what's an F-150 k below go fucking drive
around to hone ranch for a couple of

1585
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,980
days and one of these things and
think if you would want to do this.

1586
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:57,720
I don't anything else.

1587
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,041
This is,

1588
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:58,874
this is what I,

1589
00:39:59,210 --> 00:39:59,331
oh,

1590
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:00,111
that's the wrap to that.

1591
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:00,710
Rob.

1592
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:02,750
Rob and I were involved
with the development of,

1593
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,471
so that's a,

1594
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:04,850
that's a custom raptor.

1595
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:05,720
That's not like a,

1596
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:06,050
yeah,

1597
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,690
we raised that in class eight and we,

1598
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:08,790
we built it out but it,

1599
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:08,910
it,

1600
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,430
that one's still had to stock motor.

1601
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,210
Um,

1602
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:11,370
yeah.

1603
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:11,691
Stock,

1604
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:12,860
motor stocked Dash.

1605
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,560
We did have,

1606
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,260
we did have custom
suspension on it is actually,

1607
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:18,990
that's what caused me to race
the F150 last year is they go,

1608
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,290
okay well we built the raptor
a little bit and you know,

1609
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:24,560
people start chatting now online
like oh that wasn't really stock.

1610
00:40:24,561 --> 00:40:26,300
So they made us raise a stock car.

1611
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,451
Wow.

1612
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:29,250
So just not even a raptor,

1613
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:32,010
just a regular F150 regular F150 regular.

1614
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,260
Now did you bottom out at all with that?

1615
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:35,160
Um,

1616
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,300
that's probably an understatement.

1617
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:36,411
Yeah.

1618
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:37,244
Yeah.

1619
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,020
You don't bottom out with your truck?

1620
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:40,660
Uh,

1621
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,101
we do,

1622
00:40:41,101 --> 00:40:45,240
but we're going three times as fast
as the stock truck so it bottoms out.

1623
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,290
You don't feel quite as bad.

1624
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:47,490
It doesn't do as much damage.

1625
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:51,510
So the bottom of your F-150
was completely stock as well?

1626
00:40:51,511 --> 00:40:52,344
No,

1627
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,280
no plates or anything.

1628
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,170
We,

1629
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:54,351
no,

1630
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:54,681
we did.

1631
00:40:54,681 --> 00:40:55,010
We had,

1632
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:55,490
um,

1633
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,820
we definitely had a skid plate underneath
the front of them to protect the motor

1634
00:40:58,821 --> 00:40:59,211
underneath.

1635
00:40:59,211 --> 00:40:59,301
Yeah.

1636
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:00,410
Cause we bought them down a lot.

1637
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,690
That's what you see in
the front of the raptor.

1638
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:04,530
That front piece that skipped down.

1639
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,331
That's a skid plate.

1640
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:05,720
Yep.

1641
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,760
So you just installed
something along those lines.

1642
00:41:07,761 --> 00:41:08,180
Yep.

1643
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:08,720
That's it.

1644
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,140
Yep.

1645
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:09,620
Wow.

1646
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,510
And then after we raced it and then
the car was in such good shape,

1647
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,150
but I can't even believe
cause this year was what?

1648
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,771
Last year.

1649
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,890
It's to pull up that video.

1650
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,320
F150 races Baja.

1651
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,561
Yeah,

1652
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:19,360
it's a 2000 it,

1653
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,900
you'll see it.

1654
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,770
We put it up online.

1655
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,080
I'm the FordF one 50 new F-150 races,

1656
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:24,914
concrete ball.

1657
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,903
Um,

1658
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,271
they,

1659
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:26,510
uh,

1660
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,430
this was a tough 2012,

1661
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,181
2013.

1662
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:29,391
Sorry.

1663
00:41:29,391 --> 00:41:31,790
It was the single toughest
Baja thousand I've ever seen.

1664
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:32,960
I,

1665
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,160
I don't know Roger Norman,

1666
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,300
who owns score decided to,

1667
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:36,260
it was his first ball.

1668
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:37,670
1000 courses is my opinion.

1669
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,504
I'll let rob talk.

1670
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:40,760
It was his first Baja 1000.

1671
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:42,770
He wanted to make a statement
and he's a former racer.

1672
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:45,590
He wanted to make it the
worst fucking course you ever,

1673
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,431
ever could drive.

1674
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:47,420
And it was tough.

1675
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,840
It was hard and slow and fast and gnarly.

1676
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,950
And how did they change it?

1677
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,600
He just marks the course.

1678
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:53,910
She goes,

1679
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,010
this is the F150.

1680
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:55,690
This is it.

1681
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:55,930
Right.

1682
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,290
That's it.

1683
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:56,690
That's amazing.

1684
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,240
That's a stock F150 which
is the lights on it.

1685
00:41:59,241 --> 00:42:00,074
Yup.

1686
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,770
Wow.

1687
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,820
That's you driving that thing.

1688
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:02,120
Yep.

1689
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,750
I have the blue helmet sitting in my
two great F-150 fucking commercial.

1690
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:05,961
I mean,

1691
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:07,490
Ford's really smart doing this.

1692
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,050
I'm,

1693
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:11,840
I'm fucking never thought about racing
in my life and now I'm thinking,

1694
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,171
God,

1695
00:42:12,171 --> 00:42:13,004
I got to do this.

1696
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,873
Goes wrong.

1697
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,280
You got do right next time.

1698
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:16,310
Here's the way to go.

1699
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:18,830
Then you go straight to
the top trophy truck.

1700
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,060
Next time you're in Vegas,

1701
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,103
he lives in Vegas.

1702
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,921
Next time you have Vegas,

1703
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:23,510
he'll take you out to
prim and go for a ride.

1704
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:24,350
You'll shit yourself.

1705
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:25,250
I'm there in May.

1706
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,320
I'm there in May for the UFC incontinent.

1707
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,183
You'll be what?

1708
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,911
We'll make a deal.

1709
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:30,140
I'll get you UFC tickets.

1710
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:30,921
You a,

1711
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:32,870
he'd take me for a fucking
beat ride in the desert.

1712
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,943
We're in

1713
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,180
love that Amber Love
to go to the beautiful,

1714
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,120
it's good event to Tj
Dillashaw versus Hanan.

1715
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:42,200
Barao it should be fun.

1716
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,250
Um,

1717
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,400
now you guys have been involved
in this for a long time.

1718
00:42:46,401 --> 00:42:49,520
How much is the popularity
increased over the last few years?

1719
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,860
Because it seems like
there's a lot of exposure.

1720
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:53,450
Like I'm hearing about it all the time.

1721
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,310
Maybe I'm hearing about it just
because I'm friends with bud,

1722
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:56,240
but I mean,

1723
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,530
I'm seeing it online.

1724
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,530
I'm seeing like a lot of these crazy
like ram runner type trucks are being

1725
00:43:03,141 --> 00:43:03,974
built.

1726
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:04,580
Yeah.

1727
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,211
Popularity.

1728
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:05,571
It's,

1729
00:43:05,571 --> 00:43:05,871
it's,

1730
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:06,051
you know,

1731
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,600
I've known for 32 years and it's,

1732
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,930
it's increased.

1733
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,710
Um,

1734
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,960
Bud's definitely helping out
a lot with score this year,

1735
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,201
you know,

1736
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:13,460
with television production,

1737
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,930
getting us out there on TV,

1738
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:16,220
putting very good shows together.

1739
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:18,530
I think here at the end
of April and April 20th,

1740
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:19,100
April 20th.

1741
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,310
Yeah,

1742
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:19,821
we did it.

1743
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,080
We just did a deal with CBS.

1744
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:21,961
You know,

1745
00:43:21,961 --> 00:43:22,401
I just,

1746
00:43:22,401 --> 00:43:24,110
I told him this great story that I won.

1747
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,210
I won my race in 2012 in my class.

1748
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:27,760
And then Roger Norman,

1749
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,371
who was a new owner,

1750
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:29,990
came up to me and swear to God,

1751
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:30,410
he's like,

1752
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:30,650
well,

1753
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,550
now you're a champion.

1754
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:32,361
You can produce TV.

1755
00:43:32,361 --> 00:43:33,000
For me.

1756
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,833
It was what he said to me.

1757
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,270
It's like great and I get
to happy cause you know,

1758
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,220
you know me as I do,

1759
00:43:37,221 --> 00:43:37,911
I do TV,

1760
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:38,690
I do all my stuff.

1761
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,780
So now I get to kind of merge and I always
see them to this merge my two hobbies

1762
00:43:41,781 --> 00:43:42,320
together.

1763
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,300
When I was doing Jujitsu,

1764
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,210
we had king of the cage.

1765
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:44,640
Right,

1766
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,000
right.

1767
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,010
Cause I gotta have a reason and I really
a television vehicle to do something

1768
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:50,870
cause then I get to be kind
of be cool in this sport.

1769
00:43:50,871 --> 00:43:53,100
Well you're kind of a workaholic and it's,

1770
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:55,280
it helps you when you're doing Jujitsu.

1771
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:55,701
Well you know,

1772
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,460
hey I need to know what the fuck's
going on when I'm watching fights.

1773
00:43:58,461 --> 00:43:59,031
It's exactly right.

1774
00:43:59,031 --> 00:43:59,970
So it's,

1775
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,860
so it's a way to sort of make a hobby,

1776
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:04,820
a part of your job.

1777
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,710
But you do my immersion style,

1778
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:07,270
like robble,

1779
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:07,521
he's like,

1780
00:44:07,521 --> 00:44:10,100
I've raced for 10 years
and now I'm producing a TV.

1781
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:10,941
There's not much,

1782
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:12,380
I haven't done their
experience down there.

1783
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:13,280
Not like rob has,

1784
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,180
but he,

1785
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,410
I,

1786
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,130
I know the racers feel comfortable.

1787
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,200
Just like you know when
you're commentating a fight,

1788
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,490
it's a fight or you feel
comfortable that you,

1789
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:20,540
you're commentating God,

1790
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:21,530
you know what the fuck they're doing.

1791
00:44:21,531 --> 00:44:22,220
The setups,

1792
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:23,420
I know what they're doing in the car.

1793
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:25,910
I'd been on the course and not,

1794
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:26,440
not in,

1795
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,440
not in the super trucks,

1796
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:28,670
but I've been down there going,

1797
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,660
I know that course.

1798
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:30,381
I know what he's doing.

1799
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:31,170
This is what happens.

1800
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,040
That's a booby trap.

1801
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,480
Some were editing the show.

1802
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:35,040
I get to bring my experience into it.

1803
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:35,551
Yeah.

1804
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:37,150
That's got to help a lot for,

1805
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,100
for the riders,

1806
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:38,934
for the drivers.

1807
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,391
Absolutely.

1808
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:41,550
He has as much or more
passionate than I do.

1809
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,240
Just just riding around with him today
and listen to him talk about all the

1810
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,090
stuff and how jacked up he gets when
he watches the videos and stuff.

1811
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,490
He's like a kid in the
candy store and yeah,

1812
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:53,280
buds fucking show rides is what got me to,

1813
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,410
I never thought about
buying a classic car,

1814
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:56,970
but I watched his show rides.

1815
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:57,331
I'm like,

1816
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:57,991
God damn,

1817
00:44:57,991 --> 00:44:58,920
I want to carry one of those.

1818
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:00,030
That looks fucking cool.

1819
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:00,990
I think the show's coming back.

1820
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:01,380
By the way.

1821
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,213
This just coming back.

1822
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,620
It should come back to you
have Christ right back there.

1823
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:05,520
You could put two more cars.

1824
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:06,870
I this space.

1825
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,980
I got a little garage.

1826
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,873
You can put two cars.

1827
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,290
I'm thinking of expanding,

1828
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:10,771
thinking,

1829
00:45:10,771 --> 00:45:14,140
getting a bigger place that I got to
put an archery range and there's a will.

1830
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:15,390
There's an archery range here.

1831
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:15,650
We,

1832
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,920
whether either know it or not,

1833
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:20,880
there's targets in the back and there's
a straight shot 28 yards from the front

1834
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:21,900
door to the back.

1835
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,320
You got to tag the Werewolf
cause that what you got to,

1836
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,620
I've I've a compound bow sight back there.

1837
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:27,050
Uh,

1838
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,541
it's normal.

1839
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:29,510
It compound bow a target back there.

1840
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,270
Absolutely normal.

1841
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,950
Well my new thing is hunting and I've
been doing that the last couple of years.

1842
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:36,720
I'm fucking bananas about that.

1843
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:37,271
The way your banana,

1844
00:45:37,271 --> 00:45:38,190
it's about racing.

1845
00:45:38,191 --> 00:45:40,560
So I'm trying to incorporate
that into my life.

1846
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:43,180
And will we do that to them?

1847
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:43,371
Yeah.

1848
00:45:43,371 --> 00:45:46,170
They would kill animals on the
race course every once in a while.

1849
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:46,411
Yeah.

1850
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,640
But I don't think that's hunting.

1851
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:47,850
Oh,

1852
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:49,720
I think that's just traffic jam.

1853
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,420
That's just a livestock getting
on the race course back to uh,

1854
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,890
the course getting tougher.

1855
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:57,450
How did they make the course tougher,

1856
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:58,420
rob?

1857
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,253
You can enter that.

1858
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,490
Roger looks at the maps,

1859
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,360
tries to figure out the roughest worse
spots on the whole Baja peninsula and

1860
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:09,360
then tries to mark the course
so it goes through all that.

1861
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,460
He wanted to make a statement.

1862
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:13,560
We wanted to make Baja tougher than ever.

1863
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:13,721
And he,

1864
00:46:13,721 --> 00:46:17,340
he did it last 2013 it was a loop
race from Ensonata to Ensonata.

1865
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,750
It wasn't a peninsula run,

1866
00:46:18,751 --> 00:46:22,200
but he went to all the worst parts
of Baja and had us run through it.

1867
00:46:22,201 --> 00:46:24,480
So they changed the
actual place you go to.

1868
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:25,800
So there's no real benefit.

1869
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:26,371
Oh,

1870
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:26,851
every year.

1871
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:27,330
Every year.

1872
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:28,920
Every year the course gets different.

1873
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:29,461
Absolutely.

1874
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:30,271
Every year it's different.

1875
00:46:30,271 --> 00:46:31,530
Maybe runs the opposite direction,

1876
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,670
just different different areas because
that becomes a big issue with like say

1877
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:36,990
like the Nurburgring,

1878
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:42,020
which is the benchmark that they use to
test performance cars there the issue

1879
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:45,720
becomes when guys have raced
in Newburg ring so many times,

1880
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,220
they know exactly when to
slow down exactly when you
speed up and that has a big

1881
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:54,690
effect on those Nurburg Ring Times
because you know everyone's chasing that

1882
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:58,950
seven minute time around the Nurburgring
and now sub seven minute in that

1883
00:46:58,951 --> 00:46:59,371
portion,

1884
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:01,760
nine 18 they've managed
to go sub seven minutes.

1885
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,150
She just fucking insane.

1886
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,880
But a lot of that is those
guys knowing that course.

1887
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:06,301
Absolutely.

1888
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,410
Then you don't have that.

1889
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:07,920
No.

1890
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,300
Our stuff changes every time.

1891
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:09,931
It's different.

1892
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:12,750
Even loop races every time you come around
there's already been a hundred other

1893
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,520
cars that had been there since you had,

1894
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,690
it's completely different.

1895
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:16,830
Silt beds,

1896
00:47:16,831 --> 00:47:17,820
rocks or moved.

1897
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,240
So that's part of the thing that's so
interesting about our sport is never the

1898
00:47:21,241 --> 00:47:21,660
same.

1899
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:21,811
Well,

1900
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:22,560
it's interesting.

1901
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,680
It's also the mayhem
starts with the organizer.

1902
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:27,170
So I want to put in perspective for,

1903
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,800
so you know what a tough mudder is,

1904
00:47:28,801 --> 00:47:29,634
right?

1905
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,250
Um,

1906
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,480
I've heard the expression,

1907
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,770
so at tough mudder or those,

1908
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:36,160
you know those races they put through
obstacle courses and through mud holes and

1909
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:39,280
you're going to take over year to climb
up a wall and to go through fire and

1910
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:40,940
crawl through Barb wire fence.

1911
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,400
This is like a tough mudder.

1912
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,240
Our organizer,

1913
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:45,670
which is Roger and some of
the guys who mark the course,

1914
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:46,410
they want,

1915
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:46,710
they,

1916
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,901
they,

1917
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:47,481
it start,

1918
00:47:47,481 --> 00:47:50,770
the mayhem starts with them because
they'll put us through shit and they know

1919
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:52,690
we're going to get stuck or they'll go,

1920
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,860
if he's not paying attention,

1921
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:54,760
he's going to hit that rock.

1922
00:47:54,761 --> 00:47:56,710
He was going to go flip it off
the edge and that'll be great.

1923
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,180
These guys are sadistic pricks.

1924
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,010
So there's saying yes,

1925
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:03,280
you're going to set up a rock there
to make sure we're going to set up the

1926
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:04,101
course by rock.

1927
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:05,980
So if you don't pay attention,

1928
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,840
you're going to go flying
off the edge of a cliff.

1929
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:08,800
Yes,

1930
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,520
and I've been,

1931
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,061
I'm not kidding.

1932
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:10,894
Sometimes there'll be,

1933
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:12,101
it's really weird.

1934
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:13,840
You'll be reading the terrain
and reading the terrain.

1935
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:16,030
You'll come up over this rise
and there's lefthand turn,

1936
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,440
and if you don't pay attention,

1937
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:20,650
you're off Jesus Christ.

1938
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,810
If it starts with this statistic
pricks that are down there,

1939
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:23,561
mark the course.

1940
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:24,190
Am I wrong?

1941
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:24,371
No,

1942
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,204
absolutely right.

1943
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,481
Well,

1944
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:30,481
you told me once that you were driving
and you came upon a wreck and a guy had

1945
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:35,731
his bone sticking through his
leg when a guy broke his leg.

1946
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,633
Right.

1947
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:41,230
And you if flipped off the side of a
cliff and you had to get down there and

1948
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:44,530
locals are starting to creep
in and it got real sketchy.

1949
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,071
No,

1950
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:45,221
no,

1951
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:45,611
that wasn't,

1952
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:46,160
that wasn't a,

1953
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,170
you're mixing two stories,

1954
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:47,351
you mean?

1955
00:48:47,351 --> 00:48:47,620
I'm like,

1956
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:47,801
yeah,

1957
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:49,600
the Josh Barnett story in our rec.

1958
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:53,890
We had my team in Oh seven the BF
Goodrich Shimo seven had one of the worst

1959
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,000
wrecks in the planet.

1960
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,150
Everybody thought the two drivers who
were dead and I had to go in and get them.

1961
00:48:58,151 --> 00:48:58,984
And this is part of,

1962
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,351
again,

1963
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:00,640
this is an adventure race.

1964
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:01,600
It's not car racing.

1965
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:02,620
This is an adventure race.

1966
00:49:02,621 --> 00:49:03,580
And what happened in ours.

1967
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,470
This is our BC car went off the cliff
into San Javier and to guys like us,

1968
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:12,490
you say he went off the cliff at son
Javier is fucking crazy cause it's far,

1969
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,240
uh,

1970
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,073
300 feet.

1971
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,220
And there are sections on the course where
they're inverted where it's like this

1972
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,470
and you just hit the car,

1973
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,790
dropped 300 feet,

1974
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,230
rolled seven times,

1975
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,303
300 feet,

1976
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:25,570
destroyed the car.

1977
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,060
And I didn't know cause I went,

1978
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,280
we were just talking
about it cause I went,

1979
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:30,370
I was down in Loretto,

1980
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,820
we went down to La Paz and I got a call
to go back to Loreto cause our cars in

1981
00:49:33,821 --> 00:49:37,180
trouble and we can't find the car
and I didn't know where he's at.

1982
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,780
And then the guys in the car call
my wife two o'clock in the morning,

1983
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:41,590
that's not good.

1984
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,260
They call my wife on the sat phone
even though I told him how to use a sat

1985
00:49:44,261 --> 00:49:44,561
phone.

1986
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:45,394
No like,

1987
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,930
and they sound all fucked up.

1988
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:48,740
They're like us bud there.

1989
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,530
And nature's like what the fuck?

1990
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:56,710
So she calls me on my sad phone goes
like somebody just called here from the

1991
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:57,420
house and like,

1992
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:57,730
all right,

1993
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,040
where would they say the way that thick?

1994
00:49:59,050 --> 00:49:59,291
No,

1995
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,124
they just hung up.

1996
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,350
So now our car is off the course.

1997
00:50:02,351 --> 00:50:04,270
We know it's not moving
because we can track it.

1998
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:05,320
We don't know where they're at.

1999
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,150
We could kind of tell way they were,

2000
00:50:07,151 --> 00:50:08,170
they were the last time.

2001
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,940
So I did this again.

2002
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:13,240
This is an adventure race and Rob's
got 7 million of these stories.

2003
00:50:13,241 --> 00:50:16,060
I'll tell you one stupid story and then
I'll shut up cause I've been talking too

2004
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:16,271
much.

2005
00:50:16,271 --> 00:50:17,470
He keeps saying I'm going to shut up.

2006
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,304
You better stop.

2007
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:18,930
Good.

2008
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:19,661
Supposed to shut up.

2009
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:22,210
You're supposed to be here
doing a podcast but not on me.

2010
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:23,330
I self deprecating you.

2011
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:24,140
Fuck,

2012
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:24,640
I'm the dude.

2013
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,830
Tried to get my friend
tell you goddamn story.

2014
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,520
Alright,

2015
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,590
so we exists,

2016
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:33,080
we're racing and I remembered it was
Kenny Barcher might these two guys in the

2017
00:50:33,081 --> 00:50:33,261
car.

2018
00:50:33,261 --> 00:50:35,180
There was Tracy Jordan was a rock crawler,

2019
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,940
king of the hammers guy and Kenny Bartram.

2020
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:38,571
Candy bars was just,

2021
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:38,840
you know,

2022
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,790
famous guy who he cowboy Kenny does.

2023
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:41,090
Uh,

2024
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,930
he does a new kind of cowboy stuff
and he's an Fmx guys of Mozart,

2025
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:45,793
motocross guy.

2026
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,080
So I told him I to get in the car,

2027
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:49,400
San Javier is very dangerous.

2028
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:50,450
Settle yourself down,

2029
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:51,650
get you sign Javier,

2030
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:52,670
and then you can haul ass,

2031
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:53,030
you know,

2032
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:53,810
down to La Paz,

2033
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:54,530
no problem.

2034
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:55,850
13 miles from the pit,

2035
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:56,960
13 miles from the pit.

2036
00:50:56,961 --> 00:50:58,430
It's straight down.

2037
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,570
And he knows I'm not lying.

2038
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,320
There's a twisty road and
there's cliffs on one side,

2039
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:06,140
you're on the side of the mountain for
13 miles and there's clips on the side

2040
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,620
road.

2041
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,251
Real tight,

2042
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:07,911
twisty stuff.

2043
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:08,690
Don't make a mistake.

2044
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,530
And let me tell you why,

2045
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,840
because 200 years ago,

2046
00:51:11,841 --> 00:51:12,674
some priest,

2047
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:13,513
this is actually true,

2048
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:14,660
200 years ago,

2049
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:16,400
some priest on a donkey,

2050
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:17,061
they used to,

2051
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:18,180
what they used to do with emissions,

2052
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,160
they used to be two days.

2053
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:20,600
Missions used to be two days apart.

2054
00:51:20,601 --> 00:51:24,230
They'd set a mission here and then him
and a donkey and somebody else would go

2055
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:24,951
up a road.

2056
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:28,640
And when after the second day they'd
land and they build another mission right

2057
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:28,881
there.

2058
00:51:28,881 --> 00:51:30,110
And then two days later they do it.

2059
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:31,190
So up this hill,

2060
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,930
this donkey trail going up this hill,

2061
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,180
this guy and I talked to him,

2062
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,560
I had Thanksgiving dinner with him.

2063
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:39,290
He hung the wheel off it
off the corner and said,

2064
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:39,920
Oh shit,

2065
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,753
hold on.

2066
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,470
Six Times he counted the rev,

2067
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:46,100
the revolutions going over and over
and all of a sudden there was nothing.

2068
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,560
And then they hit and the
code drive was knocked out.

2069
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,780
He had a compression
brews from his helmet,

2070
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,410
um,

2071
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,243
compression boots.

2072
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,520
His helmet got hit and they put
a bruise on his skull from the,

2073
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:56,960
from the roll cage.

2074
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:58,880
So I ha,

2075
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,650
so my story is I get to Loreto and
nobody's there were sold before behind.

2076
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:04,251
There was no pit,

2077
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:05,001
there's no support.

2078
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:06,920
And there's one guy picking up cans.

2079
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,780
I'm in my race suit,

2080
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:10,753
I studied Jujitsu.

2081
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:11,361
I'm a bad ass.

2082
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:11,630
Right.

2083
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:11,871
Okay.

2084
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:15,820
So like I go up to this guy and I
look at him and he's an older guy,

2085
00:52:15,821 --> 00:52:18,320
he's in his sixties I really
didn't feel like talking.

2086
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:19,110
I just said,

2087
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:19,943
give me your keys.

2088
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,290
He looked at me,

2089
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:21,920
excuse me.

2090
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,131
I said,

2091
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:22,641
give me your keys.

2092
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:23,361
I have an injured driver.

2093
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:24,194
I need your truck.

2094
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,270
So he reaches in his pocket.

2095
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,410
I was going to beat his ass.

2096
00:52:27,411 --> 00:52:27,801
I didn't care.

2097
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:29,780
I was going to take his
truck and I'd take his truck.

2098
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,370
I have an injured driver on the course.

2099
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,320
So why wouldn't you just
ask them to help you?

2100
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:33,520
Yeah,

2101
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,353
I dunno.

2102
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,790
Full with adrenaline and
crazy and I was tired.

2103
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:40,120
And you stay up for three
days and go ask some guy from,

2104
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:43,130
I'm not standing up for three minutes
and you stay up for 36 hours and then go.

2105
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:43,491
He said,

2106
00:52:43,491 --> 00:52:44,091
excuse me sir,

2107
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:44,241
can I,

2108
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:45,020
I'm not English.

2109
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:45,800
So he said,

2110
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,790
give me your keys.

2111
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:47,091
I said,

2112
00:52:47,091 --> 00:52:47,750
gimme your keys.

2113
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,830
You lucky you didn't get shot.

2114
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:49,701
Yeah,

2115
00:52:49,701 --> 00:52:50,210
that's true.

2116
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,880
So he reaches in his pocket
and he hands out and he goes,

2117
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:53,810
can I go with you?

2118
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,321
I'm like,

2119
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:54,561
sure,

2120
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:55,130
get in.

2121
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:55,821
So I grab this,

2122
00:52:55,821 --> 00:52:59,900
I grab his truck and it was a stock Toyota
truck and we go down this river bed,

2123
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,010
did that riverbed,

2124
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:01,930
which is terrible by,

2125
00:53:01,931 --> 00:53:05,150
it took me two hours to go 13
miles and the stock Toyota truck,

2126
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,890
little tiny itty bit like a mini truck.

2127
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,560
We got to San Javier,

2128
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,140
went up searching forums,

2129
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:13,130
stopping every time
that there was a crest.

2130
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:15,800
Every time that I thought
momentum could take a driver off,

2131
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:17,330
we'd stop search,

2132
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,193
couldn't find them.

2133
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,300
So two hours we finally found them.

2134
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,070
It was still night.

2135
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:26,010
Well it was it still night I
found them and my co driver got,

2136
00:53:26,011 --> 00:53:26,850
had a concussion.

2137
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,661
He's vomiting,

2138
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:28,494
he's peeing,

2139
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,070
peeing,

2140
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:29,830
pissing himself.

2141
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:30,900
He smelled like shit.

2142
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,401
Got picked up.

2143
00:53:32,401 --> 00:53:36,270
My two drivers with down there and the
scavengers are already started taking

2144
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:36,961
wheels off the car,

2145
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:37,710
gps,

2146
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,520
anything you can get off the car.

2147
00:53:39,521 --> 00:53:41,940
You were already doing that while
the guys were inside the car,

2148
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:42,840
guys were already there.

2149
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:44,150
He got off the top of the um,

2150
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,170
out of the gully and they were
already down there picking.

2151
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,720
So I went back down there to get my
sat phone and get my other stuff.

2152
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:48,991
And I'm like,

2153
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:49,621
get the fuck away.

2154
00:53:49,621 --> 00:53:52,350
You gotta I'm shooting the Mexicans the
way that we're already picking this car

2155
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:53,100
apart.

2156
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:53,970
Wow.

2157
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,601
And uh,

2158
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:56,670
so I get Tracy back in the car.

2159
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:57,600
Um,

2160
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:57,890
and this is,

2161
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,421
these are stories,

2162
00:53:58,421 --> 00:53:59,191
these happen every,

2163
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:00,450
that's why it's an adventure race.

2164
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:00,991
I'm not like,

2165
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:02,790
I went to the drag strip
and it did nine seconds.

2166
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,380
I got Tracy back in the car two and a
half hours back and we stopped cause he

2167
00:54:07,381 --> 00:54:08,490
had to vomit every,

2168
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,540
every like every 15 minutes.

2169
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:09,901
Like hold on,

2170
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:10,960
goes well and he's vomiting.

2171
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:11,794
He got a concussion,

2172
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,653
bad concussion.

2173
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:14,130
So we get him back.

2174
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:14,910
He's okay.

2175
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,080
We get him into Loreto
as I'm gonna get him out.

2176
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,260
We were in Lauretta,

2177
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:21,780
we got him down to La Paz and
by that time it was seven,

2178
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:23,700
eight o'clock in the morning
and taken to the emergency room.

2179
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:24,870
Probably not advisable,

2180
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:25,710
but took an emergency room.

2181
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,350
I told that like,

2182
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,630
yeah,

2183
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,870
I told the doctor is Spanish that he or
he heard his dick and he's got to check

2184
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:31,704
his dick.

2185
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,063
So the doctor,

2186
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,350
so the doctor needs got to

2187
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,063
take your pants off.

2188
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,780
He starts shaking his pants.

2189
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,280
Tracy's Georgia,

2190
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:45,681
swear to God,

2191
00:54:45,681 --> 00:54:46,131
he's looking at me.

2192
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:46,371
He's like,

2193
00:54:46,371 --> 00:54:47,150
why is he out?

2194
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:47,421
I go,

2195
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:48,440
I told him you hurt your Dick.

2196
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:49,723
God.

2197
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,073
Oh,

2198
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,470
so how many people have died

2199
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,333
doing this race?

2200
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,600
Eh,

2201
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,620
there's every,

2202
00:54:57,621 --> 00:54:58,281
every year.

2203
00:54:58,281 --> 00:54:58,970
So there's,

2204
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:02,420
there's probably probably one motorcycle
or the biggest thing is there's

2205
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:03,320
accidents on the highway.

2206
00:55:03,321 --> 00:55:04,850
It's not actually that
race cars that happened,

2207
00:55:04,851 --> 00:55:05,684
but uh,

2208
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:08,810
because of the race starts and
Ensonata goes all the way to the pause.

2209
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,460
We raced all the way through the day,

2210
00:55:10,461 --> 00:55:11,031
through the night,

2211
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:11,864
into the next day.

2212
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:12,801
And I usually,

2213
00:55:12,801 --> 00:55:14,640
a lot of the accidents happen
there on the highway with,

2214
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,250
with the,

2215
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:17,360
the spectator traffic
or the chase traffic,

2216
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,110
race,

2217
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:18,943
race cars.

2218
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,770
Not Too often.

2219
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:20,251
Not Too often.

2220
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:21,660
Motorcycle guys get hurt a lot.

2221
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:22,320
I mean,

2222
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,480
Josh Barnett hit him more
to software guy and uh,

2223
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:25,830
in 13 or 12,

2224
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:26,491
in 2012,

2225
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:27,271
he had a motorcycle guy.

2226
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:29,010
But what happened was that,

2227
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,070
uh,

2228
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:30,481
you know,

2229
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:30,841
it's funny.

2230
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:34,740
Monster Energy called me and they
said they wanted to do I know any,

2231
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:35,220
um,

2232
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,370
any athletes or any athletes
are superstars and want to
come down and race cars.

2233
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:38,910
They were out.

2234
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:39,430
I'm like,

2235
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:39,740
yeah.

2236
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,590
So I called Josh.

2237
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:40,801
I know.

2238
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:41,060
He's like,

2239
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,660
he's the ultimate gearhead
and two gearheads.

2240
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,101
If you say,

2241
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:44,281
hey,

2242
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:45,114
you want to come race,

2243
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,180
he two weeks notice never
raced off road in his life.

2244
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,050
I had him in a car.

2245
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,870
He comes down there to like
the next week I put it in my,

2246
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:52,860
we do some training down,

2247
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,180
down to the sterile beach,

2248
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,790
show them how to work in the car
and next thing he's in a race.

2249
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:58,290
Poor fucker.

2250
00:55:58,290 --> 00:55:59,190
He's like a 19.

2251
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:00,130
He was 19 hours.

2252
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:00,781
He went like,

2253
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:01,580
took him 19 hours.

2254
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,150
You'd like the first stent like three,

2255
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,410
like 300 miles.

2256
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,120
He's going through a silt bed.

2257
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:09,210
There was a motorcycle guy
clips him and breaks his leg.

2258
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:10,410
Now,

2259
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,510
Josh did one of the most amazing things.

2260
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:13,920
I'm not saying that rob wouldn't do this.

2261
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:15,690
So Josh Barnett,

2262
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,710
do you know who he is?

2263
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:17,543
No.

2264
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:18,481
Youngest ever.

2265
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:19,780
UFC heavyweight champion.

2266
00:56:19,830 --> 00:56:20,820
Super Great Guy.

2267
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:21,541
Super Great Guy.

2268
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:22,650
I had him on the podcast.

2269
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,430
He's probably one of the best podcasts

2270
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,263
guest,

2271
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:25,781
excuse me,

2272
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,030
one of the best podcast
guests I've ever had.

2273
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:29,650
He's super intelligent guy.

2274
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:30,161
Yeah,

2275
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:31,420
he's so smart.

2276
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,373
Heavyweight fighter.

2277
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,250
Amazing,

2278
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,150
amazing grappler,

2279
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:34,984
amazing fighter.

2280
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,550
And He loves cars.

2281
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:37,601
He has a Shelby,

2282
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:37,940
he's got,

2283
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,550
he's got all kinds of
cars and he loves it.

2284
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:40,384
He's a fucking nut.

2285
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,460
So he goes down there into a silk,

2286
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,413
the silk bed,

2287
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:44,583
um,

2288
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:45,320
and he wanted to get,

2289
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,330
he wants to get around it,

2290
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:47,380
but you don't really have control.

2291
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:47,951
And the silt bed,

2292
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:48,521
you can hit it.

2293
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:50,560
Sometimes you hit a Rut and it
throws your ride a little bit.

2294
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:52,090
He hit this guy and broke his leg,

2295
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,320
compound fracture in his leg.

2296
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,140
So he gets through the silt bed.

2297
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,760
And not a lot of guys that do this,

2298
00:56:57,761 --> 00:56:58,181
by the way.

2299
00:56:58,181 --> 00:56:58,781
I'm just telling you,

2300
00:56:58,781 --> 00:57:00,400
it's just like for the
first time being down there.

2301
00:57:00,401 --> 00:57:03,400
So he and he feels like shit
and he'll tell you this story,

2302
00:57:03,401 --> 00:57:05,650
but he pulls off to the side of the court,

2303
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,180
goes in the silt bed,

2304
00:57:07,181 --> 00:57:07,931
which is dangerous,

2305
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:08,764
by the way,

2306
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:10,470
pulls the Guy Morton Morton,

2307
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,410
the guy's motorcycle out.

2308
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,420
So no other cars hit it
and then picks the guy up,

2309
00:57:13,421 --> 00:57:15,490
walks him out and puts them
on the hood of his car.

2310
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:16,511
Calls in,

2311
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:17,650
waits for a helicopter to come,

2312
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,520
helicopter comes.

2313
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:23,200
Josh carries this guy with a compound
fractured leg into the helicopter,

2314
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,670
drops him a helicopter,

2315
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:26,770
then puts his helmet back
on and continuous race.

2316
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:28,593
And then he rolled it.

2317
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,360
He rolled his truck after all that.

2318
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,493
There's Josh.

2319
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,310
Oh yeah,

2320
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,600
that's the rest of the
pitcher right there.

2321
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:34,970
That's it.

2322
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,210
That's his buggy monster energy truck.

2323
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:38,283
Wow.

2324
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:44,080
So you were talking about the dude who
raced on flat surfaces and then just gave

2325
00:57:45,041 --> 00:57:48,730
it up and started doing
only this kind of dirt.

2326
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:49,564
Crazy shit.

2327
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,130
There's not a lot of these courses though,

2328
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:51,940
right?

2329
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,990
It's like you could go,

2330
00:57:52,991 --> 00:57:57,250
there's a lot of race courses around the
country where the average person can go

2331
00:57:57,251 --> 00:57:58,030
and do,

2332
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:58,541
you know,

2333
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:58,961
a,

2334
00:57:58,961 --> 00:58:03,010
a track day and put on a helmet
and drive fast on a course.

2335
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:08,610
How many courses are there like this
where a guy can just go out and it's

2336
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:10,000
unlimited Baja.

2337
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,330
There's,

2338
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,440
there's roads everywhere.

2339
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,010
Um,

2340
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:12,840
go down there and,

2341
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,470
and practice or run or play.

2342
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,000
You'd have to go to Mexico to do it.

2343
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:16,690
There's,

2344
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:17,590
there's some stuff in the,

2345
00:58:17,591 --> 00:58:18,430
in the states.

2346
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:18,581
Well,

2347
00:58:18,581 --> 00:58:19,780
there's a lot of races by the way.

2348
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:19,901
Yeah.

2349
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:20,171
There's,

2350
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:20,411
I mean,

2351
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:21,310
he does short course.

2352
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,551
You can,

2353
00:58:21,551 --> 00:58:21,941
you can,

2354
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:23,800
you can gear up in a pro of pro four,

2355
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:24,634
pretty easy.

2356
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,571
And you go short court,

2357
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:26,860
race and then long there's,

2358
00:58:26,861 --> 00:58:27,250
um,

2359
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:28,450
there's two organizations.

2360
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:31,150
There's obviously score and there's a
couple of other organizations that do,

2361
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:31,511
you know,

2362
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:31,931
the mint,

2363
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:35,240
the mint 400 with rob races
in a best in desert robberies.

2364
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:36,580
And I've done some stuff in the,

2365
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:37,540
in Arizona,

2366
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:38,390
Nevada,

2367
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:38,610
you,

2368
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,291
there's a lot of race.

2369
00:58:39,291 --> 00:58:40,690
So there are a few courses.

2370
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:43,120
Are there courses or is
it just organizations?

2371
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,080
We build courses.

2372
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:44,981
They're all,

2373
00:58:44,981 --> 00:58:47,350
every off road race is unique.

2374
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:48,170
Uh,

2375
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:48,790
okay.

2376
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:49,930
So now like what if saved,

2377
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:51,730
someone's listening to
this and they're like,

2378
00:58:51,731 --> 00:58:52,151
you know what?

2379
00:58:52,151 --> 00:58:54,700
I need some goddamn adventure in my life.

2380
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:55,920
Best thing.

2381
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,310
Dues look up score,

2382
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,390
score schedules,

2383
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,230
score,

2384
00:58:59,230 --> 00:58:59,800
score,

2385
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,660
score on that tubs,

2386
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:03,310
strip club in New York City in Atlanta.

2387
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:03,461
No,

2388
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:04,420
that's wherever it is.

2389
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,790
I don't know anything about those places.

2390
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:07,760
Scoring and national.

2391
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:07,990
Yeah.

2392
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:08,711
Score in national.

2393
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,580
Looked up on the internet,

2394
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,331
look at the schedule,

2395
00:59:10,331 --> 00:59:11,081
find out where the race is,

2396
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,010
our go check one out.

2397
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,400
There's a lot of other races and
organizations that race all over.

2398
00:59:15,401 --> 00:59:16,000
Um,

2399
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,470
you know the western United States,

2400
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,110
there's almost awkward race
just about every weekend,

2401
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:20,680
somewhere,

2402
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,460
somewhere in western us

2403
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,313
you can,

2404
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:27,050
and for some folks they just
go quote unquote off-roading.

2405
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,370
So they just get a truck and find a
spot where they are allowed to drive and

2406
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:32,420
just go nutty.

2407
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:32,811
Yeah,

2408
00:59:32,811 --> 00:59:33,061
that's,

2409
00:59:33,061 --> 00:59:33,390
that's,

2410
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:34,730
those are jeep adventure guys.

2411
00:59:34,731 --> 00:59:36,770
The guys go like Moab
and they go real slow.

2412
00:59:36,771 --> 00:59:38,060
And that's not what we do,

2413
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:38,390
dad.

2414
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,160
I don't get that crawling.

2415
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,211
Look,

2416
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,860
I made it up the rock dude.

2417
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:44,000
I could walk quicker than that.

2418
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,780
You stupid fuck that Rockwell in your
truck that you need to get up to the top

2419
00:59:47,781 --> 00:59:48,561
of the rock with it.

2420
00:59:48,561 --> 00:59:48,961
You know,

2421
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,270
that doesn't make any sense to me.

2422
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:51,000
No.

2423
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:51,250
Yeah,

2424
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,400
I don't get the rock crawling.

2425
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:52,871
It's,

2426
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:53,421
it's slow.

2427
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:53,851
Speed is,

2428
00:59:53,851 --> 00:59:54,710
it's pretty incredible.

2429
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:57,740
I did a rock crawling
is actually rock race.

2430
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,090
So with the Rockies,

2431
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:00,170
well there's different things.

2432
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,610
Rock crawling is one thing,

2433
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,590
racing slow and then racing slow,

2434
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:05,930
but it's,

2435
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,120
it's pretty wild that when they do the,

2436
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:08,271
it's,

2437
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,540
I think it's the event's called King of
the hammers and you climb up some rocks

2438
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:13,370
that you can't even climb with your hands,

2439
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:18,371
but you get in this modified unlimited
vehicle that very expensive on top of it.

2440
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,850
Same with even bigger tires.

2441
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:20,271
And we have,

2442
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:21,650
and they just go right up at like,

2443
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:22,311
you're like,

2444
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:23,350
you're actually crawling a little,

2445
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,140
you can't cry,

2446
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,360
you can't climb it now.

2447
01:00:25,361 --> 01:00:26,260
You can't climb it with your,

2448
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:26,600
your,

2449
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:26,990
your,

2450
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,823
you can't,

2451
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:30,590
it's very hard for you to
climb it as a human being.

2452
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:33,230
But this car will pull up to it
or this truck kind of like a jeep,

2453
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:34,640
but it's highly modified.

2454
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:35,474
It's,

2455
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,660
it's difference between like a stock
forward F-150 and a trophy truck.

2456
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,850
It's like a stock jeep and an unlimited,

2457
01:00:40,851 --> 01:00:43,570
I think they call them
ultra force and they're,

2458
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:44,241
they're incredible.

2459
01:00:44,241 --> 01:00:44,781
What they'll do,

2460
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:48,110
they'll go up incredible
rock climbing events,

2461
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,891
straight faces.

2462
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:51,380
You'll see some of the
internet stuff is fascinating.

2463
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:52,280
It's crazy.

2464
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,001
But it is slow.

2465
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:54,260
It's racing slow.

2466
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:57,410
Well I guarantee you somebody who your
climate theology are those free climber

2467
01:00:57,411 --> 01:00:57,970
dude.

2468
01:00:57,970 --> 01:00:59,260
Like those Alex Arnold,

2469
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,410
guys that go up the,

2470
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:00,921
you know,

2471
01:01:00,921 --> 01:01:01,091
they,

2472
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,690
they go up things that aren't even flat.

2473
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,730
They're leaning towards you.

2474
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,230
He said you couldn't climb it.

2475
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:07,101
I could climb it.

2476
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:08,960
Don't fucking test me bud.

2477
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,210
I'll fucking climate right now bitch.

2478
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,583
The um,

2479
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:12,951
the,

2480
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:13,251
the,

2481
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,140
the industry like,

2482
01:01:15,141 --> 01:01:16,270
must be like,

2483
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,230
it must be a huge thing.

2484
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,510
Like building all these
different things and be,

2485
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:25,970
people must be getting involved in this
recreationally and building these like

2486
01:01:25,971 --> 01:01:29,630
trucks and taking the regular trucks
and adding all this stuff to it.

2487
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:30,890
And it's just like hot rodding.

2488
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:31,400
I mean you have,

2489
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:31,971
you have a geyser,

2490
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:32,181
right?

2491
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:32,421
Yeah.

2492
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:32,621
There's,

2493
01:01:32,621 --> 01:01:33,310
there's,

2494
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:35,360
there's the guys who
brothers built trophy trucks.

2495
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:36,650
Jim Koch builds trophy trucks.

2496
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,484
There's probably,

2497
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,670
there's probably five or six
builders that do trophy trucks.

2498
01:01:40,970 --> 01:01:41,990
And then you have all your,

2499
01:01:42,050 --> 01:01:43,910
your guys that work
out of their own shops,

2500
01:01:43,911 --> 01:01:45,650
smaller building their own stuff.

2501
01:01:45,651 --> 01:01:46,281
So that's,

2502
01:01:46,281 --> 01:01:46,730
you know,

2503
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:47,660
but alluded earlier,

2504
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:48,680
there's really no rules.

2505
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:49,371
Trophy trucks.

2506
01:01:49,371 --> 01:01:51,320
The rules are it can't fly.

2507
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:53,180
You could have unlimited suspension.

2508
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:55,370
It has to have a body like a truck body,

2509
01:01:55,371 --> 01:01:56,960
which is fiberglass and it can't fly.

2510
01:01:56,961 --> 01:01:57,920
It has to stay on the ground.

2511
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:58,521
So it's,

2512
01:01:58,521 --> 01:01:59,510
it's a unique thing.

2513
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:02,480
You can pretty much brainstorm
with whatever you can to
try to go out there and

2514
01:02:02,481 --> 01:02:03,380
beat your competition.

2515
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:03,501
Oh,

2516
01:02:03,501 --> 01:02:05,270
that's what's innovative
about the sport with you.

2517
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:07,160
When you give guys a limited horsepower,

2518
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:07,641
limited this,

2519
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:08,840
do anything you want.

2520
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:09,111
Actually,

2521
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:12,230
there is one rule that I'll tell you
that I saw that and you'll remember this

2522
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:12,891
story really well.

2523
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:14,810
There's actually only one
rule that I know of actually.

2524
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,033
Um,

2525
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:16,460
but you,

2526
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:17,061
you get to,

2527
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:17,750
you get it.

2528
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,830
Especially in competition.

2529
01:02:18,831 --> 01:02:20,010
You get to breed the best of the

2530
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,590
human mind because he's
trying to beat this other guy.

2531
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:23,580
I'm going to kick his ass.

2532
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:24,420
So here's the one rule.

2533
01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:27,810
Oh eight oh seven I
think is oh seven right?

2534
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:28,980
There's a guy named Brian Collins.

2535
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,091
Swear to God.

2536
01:02:30,091 --> 01:02:30,924
This happened.

2537
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,290
They took a fueling system
off an Apache helicopter,

2538
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:34,621
right?

2539
01:02:34,621 --> 01:02:37,440
Stuck it off the back of their truck
and they had a fueling truck that would

2540
01:02:37,441 --> 01:02:42,441
walk up to it while they're moving and
jam it in the back of it and refuel it.

2541
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:43,854
Why they're moving.

2542
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:45,121
And finally a score.

2543
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:45,481
It was that,

2544
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:46,610
oh seven Oh eight when was that?

2545
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:46,990
I think it was,

2546
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,270
I think it was Mark Miller and Ryan,

2547
01:02:48,271 --> 01:02:48,870
our cro,

2548
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:49,710
holy man,

2549
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:50,521
they did it on the highway.

2550
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:50,681
They,

2551
01:02:50,681 --> 01:02:51,330
they,

2552
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:53,190
they developed a system on a,

2553
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:58,250
on a regular chase truck
that was following the race
truck down the highway and

2554
01:02:58,381 --> 01:03:01,680
the fuel was in the bed of the chase
truck and they had a pressurized system.

2555
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:05,010
If they pulled up why they're going
60 miles an hour down the highway.

2556
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,590
They pulled up behind the
race truck and it had like a,

2557
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:11,790
like a nozzle out the front of it and
they stabbed it into the nozzle that was

2558
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,220
on the race truck and they filled it,

2559
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,660
Jesus Christ.

2560
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:17,070
So they could save four minutes.

2561
01:03:17,071 --> 01:03:18,450
They could save two or
three minutes in the pin,

2562
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:20,940
not even supposed to smoke
when you were at a gas station.

2563
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:23,101
I think that's a rule.

2564
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:23,934
It's like no more,

2565
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:24,950
no more fueling way.

2566
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:25,784
Goal number highway.

2567
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:30,830
Supposed to use your cell phone while
you're at a gas station because very

2568
01:03:30,961 --> 01:03:35,961
rarely a spark and electronic spark
can ignite fumes and you can burst into

2569
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:36,750
flames.

2570
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:40,200
Like that's happened before and
he's talking crazy assholes.

2571
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:43,290
I go at 60 miles an hour filling
in their car up on the highway.

2572
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:45,030
I remember once I was with
a herps team that year.

2573
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,560
I forgot what it was and herps.

2574
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,950
Yeah.

2575
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,540
Herps like herpes.

2576
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:48,750
Uh,

2577
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:48,911
no.

2578
01:03:48,911 --> 01:03:49,561
Life's terrible.

2579
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:50,341
Herb's like in Vegas,

2580
01:03:50,341 --> 01:03:51,240
the herps gas stations,

2581
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:52,074
the herps hotel,

2582
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:53,100
I don't know what that is.

2583
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:54,720
They're pretty big.

2584
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:54,991
They're,

2585
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:56,340
they're there a day of the herps hotels,

2586
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:57,174
right on paradise.

2587
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,040
That's a terrible place to go and stay.

2588
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,970
Get sorry for the people who own it,

2589
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,940
but just the doping don't
be sorry for the name.

2590
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,270
Yeah,

2591
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:07,230
we're going to stay at the Herbst.

2592
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,093
Good luck.

2593
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:09,180
I got that.

2594
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,013
Got The herps.

2595
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,033
Yeah,

2596
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,050
I got to the herps shit.

2597
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,040
You're going to be okay.

2598
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,600
Did you take your medication?

2599
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,390
Use some antibacterial soap,

2600
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,760
so I didn't know I was with them.

2601
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:21,481
What else?

2602
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,320
I won't say their name again.

2603
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,970
I was with them and we
saw that and were like,

2604
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,020
we're all kind of like,

2605
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:25,441
ah,

2606
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,580
that's pretty cool.

2607
01:04:26,610 --> 01:04:28,110
And did they win that year?

2608
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,471
Yeah,

2609
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:31,320
they did one that year because of that,

2610
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:32,260
while saving time.

2611
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,050
There's more to it than just that.

2612
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:37,410
But it helps you think that saved
throughout the thousand mile race.

2613
01:04:37,411 --> 01:04:38,790
Probably 10 minutes,

2614
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:41,580
10 minutes at a time instead
of stopping in the pit.

2615
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:42,420
And that matters.

2616
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,110
Absolutely.

2617
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:44,160
Now no one's sleeping.

2618
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,360
You guys are just driving
everybody in the race truck,

2619
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:48,510
they're driving the whole way.

2620
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:49,680
Some people solo.

2621
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:53,160
They drive the whole thousand mile race
without getting out of the truck drive

2622
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:53,461
the whole way.

2623
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:54,420
I've done that in the past.

2624
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:56,590
Do you have a diaper on cod?

2625
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,630
They have these catheters.

2626
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:03,140
Oh cause his kid is a tube in your Dick
and your hobby is way out of control

2627
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:05,700
when you put that bad that's not a tube.

2628
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:06,900
And your texting is a catheter.

2629
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:07,170
Right.

2630
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:07,921
My favorite things,

2631
01:05:07,921 --> 01:05:08,641
I like having it.

2632
01:05:08,641 --> 01:05:09,490
Like I read Kevin,

2633
01:05:09,491 --> 01:05:10,300
it's you live in Dick.

2634
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:10,740
No,

2635
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:11,640
cause it's not what it is,

2636
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,100
but it's the best thing that's
ever happened for off road for me.

2637
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:14,911
It is amazing.

2638
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,960
It goes over the top like a,

2639
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:16,350
like a,

2640
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:17,380
Oh like a condom.

2641
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:17,800
Right.

2642
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:18,010
And then

2643
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,690
a rubber hose connected
to the end of that.

2644
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:22,000
That goes all the way down the inside
of your leg and you taped at the end of

2645
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:26,800
the hose to the side of your shoe so
you can piss in your shoe next to you

2646
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:27,101
shoots.

2647
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:29,740
The best thing I know it's in the
truck and somebody just [inaudible].

2648
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:31,060
Some people have done that though.

2649
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:34,420
They don't get the tube out of their
shoe before they start racing and they're

2650
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,460
actually finding out their p
and that's another great story.

2651
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:37,031
Ivan Stewart,

2652
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:41,680
who's a legend in your foot out the
window and then we don't have carpet.

2653
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:42,371
It's all metal.

2654
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,190
Aluminum down there as
a hole in the floor.

2655
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:45,070
Yeah,

2656
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:46,360
that there's leaks,

2657
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:49,660
there's little panels and stuff and so
you just pee on the floor and just hope

2658
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:50,680
it goes away somewhere.

2659
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:50,940
Yeah,

2660
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:51,550
it does.

2661
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:51,851
It does.

2662
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:52,001
Well,

2663
01:05:52,001 --> 01:05:53,250
the best thing is you pulled in the pits,

2664
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:53,890
you start paying,

2665
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:54,341
you tell your,

2666
01:05:54,341 --> 01:05:54,681
your,

2667
01:05:54,681 --> 01:05:55,630
your mechanic was like,

2668
01:05:55,631 --> 01:05:57,580
I think I've got a leak and
he's down there sniffing it.

2669
01:05:58,610 --> 01:05:59,530
That's a great,

2670
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:00,041
that story,

2671
01:06:00,041 --> 01:06:00,251
right?

2672
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,670
There's happened multiple times and the,

2673
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:02,670
the one I was going to tell you about,

2674
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:07,310
it's Ivan Stewart icon of the sport
was that the start line and warm in his

2675
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:07,961
truck up.

2676
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:10,380
He's just about ready to go off the
start line and all of a sudden underneath

2677
01:06:10,381 --> 01:06:11,214
his truck there's,

2678
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,830
there's liquid in one of his
mechanics jumps underneath her like,

2679
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:15,521
Holy Shit,

2680
01:06:15,521 --> 01:06:16,570
what does that goes?

2681
01:06:16,571 --> 01:06:17,590
Touches his finger in it,

2682
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,250
comes up,

2683
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:18,821
smells it,

2684
01:06:18,821 --> 01:06:21,800
and realizes what it is that
Ivan's actually taken a piss.

2685
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,650
It didn't mean to ruin your story,

2686
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:24,970
but for your listeners,

2687
01:06:24,971 --> 01:06:25,450
by the way,

2688
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:26,340
get a Catherine,

2689
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:27,011
go online,

2690
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:27,844
get a race catheter.

2691
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:28,650
The best things like,

2692
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:28,840
um,

2693
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,561
like in a bar.

2694
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:32,350
I did the race or UFC fight or UFC fight.

2695
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:32,770
I did,

2696
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:33,500
I did this.

2697
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:34,420
I have to miss anything.

2698
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:34,721
Yeah,

2699
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:36,130
but then you get a p on the ground.

2700
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:36,520
Yeah.

2701
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,840
You can compete in the bar near drain.

2702
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:38,171
It's fine.

2703
01:06:38,171 --> 01:06:38,441
I was,

2704
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:39,430
I would have this blue water.

2705
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:41,560
I was at this blue water
race in Arizona one time.

2706
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:42,280
Uh,

2707
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,250
I think it was Greg Fouts
and we got our ass kicked.

2708
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:45,971
We're just putting around.

2709
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:47,040
We got stuck a couple of times.

2710
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:47,874
I'll stock full.

2711
01:06:48,010 --> 01:06:50,030
So we actually got to the bar and we were,

2712
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,040
it felt like a dick by the way.

2713
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:53,260
And I had my race suit on
because we came in so late.

2714
01:06:53,261 --> 01:06:55,660
But the bar is gone and everybody's
there and they're having a celebration.

2715
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,560
I just kept my catheter on instead of him.

2716
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:58,470
So I'm just sitting at the bar.

2717
01:06:58,500 --> 01:06:58,950
I'm like,

2718
01:06:58,950 --> 01:06:59,920
I get next to somebody.

2719
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:00,754
Just start peeing.

2720
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:01,250
Ah,

2721
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:01,490
okay.

2722
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:01,750
Okay,

2723
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,140
and you're done.

2724
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:02,590
You don't have to come.

2725
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:04,030
You just pee on the ground of the bar.

2726
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,590
You son of a bitch.

2727
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,140
I can't believe you think that's funny.

2728
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,093
How dare you.

2729
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:11,110
What about the person that owns that par?

2730
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,170
You're just peeing in their establishment
right on the floor for a beer.

2731
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:16,260
I don't give a fuck that guy.

2732
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:17,860
Somebody has to buy the beer,

2733
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:18,720
bring it there.

2734
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,870
If somebody has to pay to be,

2735
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,230
put the refrigerator in and turn it on.

2736
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:24,791
Don't feel sorry.

2737
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:25,600
Eight Bucks,

2738
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,433
eight bucks.

2739
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:27,333
Don't buy it.

2740
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:28,330
That's what it looks like.

2741
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:29,300
Black cat.

2742
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:29,620
Yeah.

2743
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:30,820
That's one of the brands right there.

2744
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,540
Wow.

2745
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:31,930
That.

2746
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:33,100
That is ridiculous.

2747
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:34,300
When you're in a sport,

2748
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,490
when you have to have a
hose taped over your deck.

2749
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,020
Maybe there's a problem with that.

2750
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,650
Support babies.

2751
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,330
You don't bribe.

2752
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:42,370
You don't drink coffee.

2753
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:43,270
No,

2754
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:43,690
never.

2755
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:43,961
Never.

2756
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:44,794
When I was a kid,

2757
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:46,271
my mom,

2758
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:47,051
dad drink coffee.

2759
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:47,980
I couldn't stand the smell.

2760
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,690
Probably got to early twenties or so,

2761
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,950
realized I'd never had it and said,

2762
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,360
you know what I'm going to do without it.

2763
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,500
For from my life.

2764
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:54,700
So I'm a soda guy.

2765
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:56,043
So you drink soda?

2766
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:56,530
Yeah,

2767
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,670
that's my fix in the morning.

2768
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:00,040
So is that what you
get your caffeine from?

2769
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:03,370
I mean like when you're
doing a 33 hour run,

2770
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,670
like you must do some form
of stimulant to stay awake.

2771
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,170
No.

2772
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:07,800
Ah,

2773
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,540
it,

2774
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,290
the adrenaline that gets going in
you when you're winning the race,

2775
01:08:11,590 --> 01:08:11,891
you know,

2776
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:12,220
you get,

2777
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,050
you get into the night,

2778
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:16,910
typically are bottling thousands starts
at o'clock and you'll finish at two,

2779
01:08:16,911 --> 01:08:17,744
three in the morning.

2780
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:18,853
For me,

2781
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:19,670
uh,

2782
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:20,600
if we're doing well,

2783
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,520
but about midnight when
you start to get tired,

2784
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:24,680
usually realize you're in shit.

2785
01:08:24,681 --> 01:08:27,080
You got a chance to win this race and
the adrenaline kicks in and takes you

2786
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:27,914
right to the finish.

2787
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,660
It's when you're having a bad day,

2788
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:30,801
lots of troubles,

2789
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:34,160
and you're pulling a 36 hour event that
and you're not capable of winning the

2790
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:34,371
race,

2791
01:08:34,371 --> 01:08:37,610
the adrenaline goes away and then need
to throw some sodas down to keep it going

2792
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:38,060
or,

2793
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,020
or some energy drinks.

2794
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:39,571
Yeah,

2795
01:08:39,571 --> 01:08:42,660
I would think that that would get really
sketchy when you're dealing with like

2796
01:08:42,661 --> 01:08:45,870
these crazy terms where you really have
to be paying attention and you've been

2797
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,220
up for 25 hours.

2798
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,320
That must be where the real danger lies.

2799
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:49,540
No,

2800
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,021
absolutely.

2801
01:08:50,021 --> 01:08:50,291
And that's,

2802
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:50,650
you know,

2803
01:08:50,650 --> 01:08:53,710
most likely Bud's earlier story
with the candy bars from and,

2804
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:54,761
and Tracy Jordan,

2805
01:08:54,761 --> 01:08:55,660
when they went off the cliff,

2806
01:08:55,661 --> 01:08:56,890
I mean they just got in the car,

2807
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:00,430
but I believe they were in
the car earlier that same day.

2808
01:09:00,431 --> 01:09:00,731
Right?

2809
01:09:00,731 --> 01:09:01,630
So they,

2810
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,800
the Baja peninsula,

2811
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:03,711
the race course,

2812
01:09:03,711 --> 01:09:04,400
a thousand miles,

2813
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:04,900
the highways,

2814
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:05,651
800 miles,

2815
01:09:05,651 --> 01:09:09,190
most likely they'd got up in the morning
and Ensonata did a couple stints in the

2816
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:10,270
race car got out,

2817
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,940
but they were traveling down the
race course down the highway.

2818
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:16,190
And when they got back in and it
was early hours of the morning and,

2819
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,380
and dusty,

2820
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,621
maybe foggy.

2821
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:18,900
And

2822
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,011
Yeah,

2823
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:21,570
you can remember that every
turn could end your race.

2824
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:23,310
Maybe it may be in your life if you're,

2825
01:09:23,311 --> 01:09:24,210
if you're going too fast.

2826
01:09:24,211 --> 01:09:25,021
But every turn.

2827
01:09:25,021 --> 01:09:25,860
So for,

2828
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,461
for me,

2829
01:09:26,461 --> 01:09:28,740
because obviously you can tell I
have an issue with paying attention,

2830
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,060
I think.

2831
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,860
I can't think of anything else.

2832
01:09:31,861 --> 01:09:33,720
And that's why I always ate
quite at the cage fighting.

2833
01:09:33,721 --> 01:09:34,590
If you get in the cage,

2834
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,080
you start thinking about your
bills and your check and you know,

2835
01:09:37,081 --> 01:09:40,290
they've got this happen and all the
bullshit you're gonna get your ass kicked.

2836
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:41,551
Same thing down here.

2837
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:45,540
The only thing you have to really worry
about is you're looking at brush or

2838
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:46,261
looking at dust.

2839
01:09:46,261 --> 01:09:47,370
You're looking at power lines,

2840
01:09:47,371 --> 01:09:48,141
looking at all that.

2841
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:51,480
You're reading the terrain and that's
all the consumes your mind because if you

2842
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:51,930
don't,

2843
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:52,730
you're fuck

2844
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:52,911
yeah.

2845
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:54,350
That's a thing that people need,

2846
01:09:54,351 --> 01:09:54,750
right?

2847
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:59,750
Like I find that I gravitate towards
things that require my full completed

2848
01:10:00,501 --> 01:10:01,670
tension in the moment,

2849
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,661
whether it's,

2850
01:10:02,661 --> 01:10:03,200
uh,

2851
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,930
going to the rifle range
and shooting a rifle.

2852
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:06,351
You know,

2853
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:06,701
like I,

2854
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:07,161
I took,

2855
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:07,400
um,

2856
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,290
my friend Duncan and Chris yesterday,

2857
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:11,930
we went to the rifle range and it's one
of the things that Duncan was saying,

2858
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:12,830
like when you're shooting,

2859
01:10:12,831 --> 01:10:14,450
you don't think about anything else.

2860
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,400
Like the moment you're
pulling that trigger,

2861
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:20,690
your mind is free of all the other
nonsense you got going on in your life.

2862
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,870
Your mind is just concentrating
on keeping the radical,

2863
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:26,330
keeping that crosshair on that target,

2864
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:31,280
calming your nerves and then squeezing
that trigger and not moving anything

2865
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:32,030
else.

2866
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:33,860
What is it about us that we need?

2867
01:10:33,861 --> 01:10:34,940
Things like that.

2868
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,850
Is it the over complex
society that we live in?

2869
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:38,381
I think so.

2870
01:10:38,381 --> 01:10:38,591
I think,

2871
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,210
you know there's it with my business,

2872
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:41,510
your business and all elevated.

2873
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:41,870
We're doing,

2874
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:45,100
there's text messages and there's fucking
Facebook and Twitter and you've got to

2875
01:10:45,101 --> 01:10:47,140
all this bullshit and there's
so much stuff in there.

2876
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:48,910
And the thing that I think is different,

2877
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,020
much different than rifles,

2878
01:10:50,021 --> 01:10:52,660
like there's consequences of
what we do because if we don't,

2879
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:53,620
if you miss the shot,

2880
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,221
oh Ho hum.

2881
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:54,971
I missed the shot.

2882
01:10:54,971 --> 01:10:56,260
I'm not running down rifle.

2883
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:57,130
You don't shoot me.

2884
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:57,970
But yeah,

2885
01:10:57,970 --> 01:10:59,410
but in what we do,

2886
01:10:59,411 --> 01:10:59,830
if you,

2887
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:00,700
and I've done it before,

2888
01:11:00,701 --> 01:11:01,130
I'm like,

2889
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,570
I,

2890
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:03,850
you kind of get into a law
like driving in a snowstorm.

2891
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,820
You see the snow storm coming
out and you kind of get drive.

2892
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,150
You kind of drive yourself,

2893
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:08,200
do a little bit of sleep,

2894
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:09,550
turn comes up,

2895
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:10,510
you're going to go off a cliff,

2896
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:11,440
you're going to wreck your,

2897
01:11:11,441 --> 01:11:13,170
someone's going to hit
you from behind you.

2898
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:14,250
You know that the,

2899
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:19,530
the worst it's death need the very easiest
as you broke your car and you gotta

2900
01:11:19,531 --> 01:11:19,651
get,

2901
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,900
you gotta get out there and fix it
and you just let your team down.

2902
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:23,190
There are teams,

2903
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:26,760
he's got 60 70 people that are on his
team and then they all worked really hard

2904
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:30,090
to get him down there and that
pressure's on him not to fuck up,

2905
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:35,510
but is a weird that we as human beings
have this strange desire to chase danger

2906
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:36,330
like that,

2907
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,260
that like that,

2908
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:42,690
that managing danger becomes
sort of like a drug fix.

2909
01:11:42,691 --> 01:11:43,524
We're getting,

2910
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,530
well,

2911
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:44,770
you're,

2912
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,230
you're a lot deeper human being than I am,

2913
01:11:46,231 --> 01:11:46,651
but this is,

2914
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:48,420
this goes back to the primal human.

2915
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:49,530
We used to go on hunts,

2916
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,211
right as,

2917
01:11:50,211 --> 01:11:50,791
as guys,

2918
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:51,600
we used to go and hunt.

2919
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,111
We used to like,

2920
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:52,651
you stay here,

2921
01:11:52,651 --> 01:11:55,050
I'm going to go on a hunt and I'm going
to chase bear and going to kill the

2922
01:11:55,051 --> 01:11:55,470
buffalo.

2923
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,041
I'm going to go on the,

2924
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:56,970
I'm going to go to war,

2925
01:11:56,971 --> 01:11:58,830
I'm going to do these things and yeah,

2926
01:11:58,831 --> 01:11:59,110
I don't,

2927
01:11:59,110 --> 01:11:59,791
I don't know what it is.

2928
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:03,290
You get to a certain part of your life
and you've got to start chasing that.

2929
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,200
You have to have it.

2930
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:05,250
Like I don't need to raise,

2931
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:06,180
I'd have to race.

2932
01:12:06,210 --> 01:12:06,361
Well,

2933
01:12:06,361 --> 01:12:10,600
I think there's certain human reward
systems that are set up in our minds and

2934
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:15,680
essentially in our DNA and that we don't
fulfill them at all with the average,

2935
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:19,260
the average everyday cubicle life traffic,

2936
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:22,140
cubicle come home television.

2937
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,440
The news bombards you with fucking
nonsense from all around the world.

2938
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,890
And then you go to sleep and start all
over again and you're missing a lot of

2939
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:29,490
shit.

2940
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:32,700
And then something comes along
like this race where like,

2941
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:32,831
you know,

2942
01:12:32,831 --> 01:12:37,200
if are you fucking jumping
around this crazy fucking truck,

2943
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:39,900
you're going 140 miles an
hour and your body's like,

2944
01:12:39,901 --> 01:12:40,040
yeah,

2945
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,090
finally,

2946
01:12:41,091 --> 01:12:42,790
something's happening.

2947
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:43,683
Yeah.

2948
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:45,770
It's addiction for me.

2949
01:12:45,771 --> 01:12:46,311
Absolutely.

2950
01:12:46,311 --> 01:12:46,671
I mean,

2951
01:12:46,671 --> 01:12:47,451
when I'm not racing,

2952
01:12:47,451 --> 01:12:49,280
last year I reached 35 weekends.

2953
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:49,490
I,

2954
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,670
it took the green flag
fucking hat most of the year.

2955
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:58,660
I think I took the green flag over 80
times and every time basically I started a

2956
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:00,080
race.

2957
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:00,830
I started race,

2958
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:01,700
they threw a green flag.

2959
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:06,080
So I raced over 80 times
last year in 35 weekends.

2960
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,030
Some of these times I
take four green flags.

2961
01:13:08,031 --> 01:13:11,690
Actually one weekend last year I took
seven green flags over the weekend racing

2962
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:12,830
in three different trucks.

2963
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:13,923
Um,

2964
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:14,941
discussed her,

2965
01:13:14,941 --> 01:13:16,940
there's multiple classes
and the short course races,

2966
01:13:16,941 --> 01:13:17,990
there's multiple classes.

2967
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:19,670
So I'm addicted it so much.

2968
01:13:19,671 --> 01:13:21,770
I go get in any vehicle I can go race.

2969
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:22,940
So I reached seven times.

2970
01:13:22,941 --> 01:13:23,810
But when there's,

2971
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:24,261
when there's,

2972
01:13:24,261 --> 01:13:25,220
when I have a weekend off,

2973
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,660
I don't know what to do with myself.

2974
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,960
So I think I need that adrenaline rush.

2975
01:13:29,990 --> 01:13:31,550
I need to race,

2976
01:13:31,551 --> 01:13:32,810
I need to get a checkered flag,

2977
01:13:32,811 --> 01:13:33,411
I need to win.

2978
01:13:33,411 --> 01:13:35,700
That's really what my life is about.

2979
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,940
Becoming a part of me.

2980
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:39,523
Absolutely.

2981
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,090
And Bud,

2982
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:40,580
you've been,

2983
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:44,610
she'd been chasing stuff like that
all as long as I've known you,

2984
01:13:44,611 --> 01:13:49,611
you're always like trying to do
some crazy like charged up thing.

2985
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:51,240
It builds your character.

2986
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:53,910
I think he's the guy you build to
helps you build your character.

2987
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:54,231
And I'm,

2988
01:13:54,231 --> 01:13:54,660
I'm,

2989
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,920
I'm addicted to drugs.

2990
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:59,520
My drug is a Dorfman's and
adrenaline and I have to have that.

2991
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:00,691
I think it was,

2992
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:01,350
um,

2993
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,870
I forgot who said it might've been
Rhys Millen or someone like that,

2994
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:04,391
but they said in,

2995
01:14:04,391 --> 01:14:05,160
in,

2996
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:08,130
in normal life you had the guy in
the cubicle sit in New York City,

2997
01:14:08,131 --> 01:14:12,190
he may have like one close call
on in his whole entire life

2998
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,090
or maybe one a year down in Mexico
you have nine or 10 in a race.

2999
01:14:16,350 --> 01:14:16,530
You,

3000
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:16,751
I mean,

3001
01:14:16,751 --> 01:14:18,670
you are close to death a few times.

3002
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:19,180
I mean,

3003
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,050
Holy Shit.

3004
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:20,501
Oh fuck.

3005
01:14:20,501 --> 01:14:21,460
I'm glad that didn't happen.

3006
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:23,850
And you do that for
over and over and it's,

3007
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:24,630
it's,

3008
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:25,970
it's scary for,

3009
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:26,320
you know.

3010
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:26,771
Definitely.

3011
01:14:26,771 --> 01:14:26,881
I've,

3012
01:14:26,881 --> 01:14:27,041
you know,

3013
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:27,321
I've tried,

3014
01:14:27,321 --> 01:14:28,660
I did a movie in the raptor,

3015
01:14:28,661 --> 01:14:30,070
I don't know if you saw it.

3016
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:30,981
No,

3017
01:14:30,981 --> 01:14:31,610
I never saw that.

3018
01:14:31,610 --> 01:14:32,121
When you do,

3019
01:14:32,121 --> 01:14:32,841
you did that,

3020
01:14:32,841 --> 01:14:33,351
like you,

3021
01:14:33,351 --> 01:14:35,750
you produced a film about the Ford Raptor,

3022
01:14:35,751 --> 01:14:37,070
like right when it was coming out.

3023
01:14:37,071 --> 01:14:37,581
Is that what it was?

3024
01:14:37,581 --> 01:14:38,121
Was the launch,

3025
01:14:38,121 --> 01:14:39,340
the launch of that was a launching

3026
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:40,893
oh eight.

3027
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:41,440
And um,

3028
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:41,860
I,

3029
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:42,540
my wife,

3030
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,690
there was two movies back to back.

3031
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:43,991
I did.

3032
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:48,340
And there was one time we got stuck
all the guests and I got stuck.

3033
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,451
You remember the scene?

3034
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:49,621
And I,

3035
01:14:49,621 --> 01:14:51,430
I took a tow a tow strap,

3036
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:52,810
pulled it to the front of the thing,

3037
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:55,510
walked across and hook it
to my friend's truck and uh,

3038
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,110
some idiot and the trophy truck wasn't me.

3039
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,610
Ran over my strap like right where I was.

3040
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:04,210
Whoa.

3041
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:04,800
I mean,

3042
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,330
cause you know,

3043
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:05,531
you're,

3044
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:06,880
you're in this blinding silt bed.

3045
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:07,181
I don't think.

3046
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:08,080
He did not try to kill me.

3047
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:09,100
He's blinding silt bed.

3048
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:10,720
He knows if he slows down,

3049
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,651
he just sees a whole,

3050
01:15:11,651 --> 01:15:13,180
there's a truck and there's a guy,

3051
01:15:13,181 --> 01:15:14,260
I'm going to go right between it.

3052
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:14,561
And I'm like,

3053
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:15,510
oh my God,

3054
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:16,031
talk.

3055
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:16,960
That was very close,

3056
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,681
really close.

3057
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:18,160
So I,

3058
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,380
that was the scene in our
movie and my wife is like,

3059
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,370
ah,

3060
01:15:21,370 --> 01:15:21,681
yeah,

3061
01:15:21,681 --> 01:15:22,540
you're not doing that anymore.

3062
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,480
It's quite often she saw it.

3063
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:26,350
Oh Wow.

3064
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:26,950
My wife,

3065
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:27,611
one last story.

3066
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:27,851
He says,

3067
01:15:27,851 --> 01:15:30,490
my wife in 2012 when I won my race,

3068
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,630
I called my wife.

3069
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,040
I,

3070
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:32,400
it's,

3071
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,071
I'm excited.

3072
01:15:33,071 --> 01:15:34,000
I won one race.

3073
01:15:34,001 --> 01:15:37,450
Rob's run 220 races more
than anybody in the planet.

3074
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,920
I won one race.

3075
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:40,270
I called my wife at five o'clock.

3076
01:15:40,330 --> 01:15:40,571
I said,

3077
01:15:40,571 --> 01:15:40,871
honey,

3078
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:41,350
we want,

3079
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,550
I've been chased it for nine years.

3080
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,151
She said,

3081
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:43,391
good,

3082
01:15:43,391 --> 01:15:43,961
you can quit,

3083
01:15:43,961 --> 01:15:44,794
and she hung up on me.

3084
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:46,210
I got no,

3085
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:47,380
I got no play at all.

3086
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:47,681
I'm like,

3087
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:48,550
I'm so excited.

3088
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:49,480
Like I can't,

3089
01:15:49,530 --> 01:15:50,680
I want to call my mom.

3090
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:51,610
I went to call my wife.

3091
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:52,444
I wanted to like,

3092
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:53,500
Hey,

3093
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:53,951
guess what?

3094
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:54,461
I did this.

3095
01:15:54,461 --> 01:15:54,761
He's like,

3096
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:54,881
yeah,

3097
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:55,301
that's nice.

3098
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,134
You can quit now.

3099
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,470
Yeah.

3100
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:02,470
It's hard for some people to relate to
that need to be charged up and do nutty

3101
01:16:04,171 --> 01:16:05,130
things like that,

3102
01:16:05,131 --> 01:16:05,610
right?

3103
01:16:05,610 --> 01:16:05,941
Yeah,

3104
01:16:05,941 --> 01:16:06,480
I think so.

3105
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,420
I mean for me it's all
about winning championships,

3106
01:16:09,421 --> 01:16:10,590
winning races and uh,

3107
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:11,940
can't get enough of it.

3108
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,310
Well so many people trying to,

3109
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,560
they've tried to live their life safe,

3110
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:16,801
you know,

3111
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:18,180
they tried to do just the opposite.

3112
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:21,600
They're like looking for the softest
cushion to sit on there looking for the

3113
01:16:21,601 --> 01:16:22,770
easiest job.

3114
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:26,220
They're looking for the longest
amount of time off to looking for the,

3115
01:16:26,221 --> 01:16:29,640
this to the cushiest existence.

3116
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:31,990
No that's not living.

3117
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:34,830
You got to get out there
and experience life.

3118
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:35,664
You got to live it.

3119
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:38,070
Yeah I agree.

3120
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:39,930
But I mean there's that,

3121
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:42,990
there's like these two schools of
thought when it comes to people.

3122
01:16:42,991 --> 01:16:47,991
There's people that try to seek out
adventure and thrills and have all these

3123
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:51,810
wild experiences in their life and
there's people that have zero desire.

3124
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,270
See Joe and I have it.

3125
01:16:53,271 --> 01:16:54,001
We have a disease.

3126
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:56,550
We have like a dinner party
or disease or that we share.

3127
01:16:56,580 --> 01:16:57,290
Like I,

3128
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:59,130
I can't talk to those people.

3129
01:16:59,160 --> 01:16:59,380
Right.

3130
01:16:59,380 --> 01:16:59,820
Cause I,

3131
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,050
I seek out,

3132
01:17:01,051 --> 01:17:01,291
like I,

3133
01:17:01,291 --> 01:17:04,260
I do deep sea dives on shipwrecks
and I'll try to go to this.

3134
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:05,490
Not because I think I'm a bad ass shit.

3135
01:17:05,491 --> 01:17:06,840
Cause I'm pushing myself,

3136
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,640
I always want to push myself.

3137
01:17:08,641 --> 01:17:10,010
I have to do something to

3138
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,581
train for it.

3139
01:17:10,581 --> 01:17:14,070
So when I go talk to people like regular
people or people that are boring as

3140
01:17:14,071 --> 01:17:14,904
shit,

3141
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:17,600
I sound like an idiot and I had
nothing to say to them cause you,

3142
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,231
you,

3143
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:21,230
you try to do what we just did here
in Rob's got a million of them.

3144
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:23,450
You try to tell them an
adventure story in Baja.

3145
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,840
Like I hit a jump at 120 and I jumped
this or accidentally hit this guy on a

3146
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:27,840
bike and the like,

3147
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:28,850
they think you're crazy.

3148
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:29,810
Yeah.

3149
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:31,250
There's certain people that it's just,

3150
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:31,940
it's too,

3151
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,720
it's too time consuming trying to
explain your motivations behind certain

3152
01:17:35,721 --> 01:17:36,081
things.

3153
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:37,430
Like I try to think of like,

3154
01:17:37,431 --> 01:17:41,660
what's the least thrilling thing that I
do that I could sort of tell people that

3155
01:17:41,661 --> 01:17:42,494
I do?

3156
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:42,951
Like what do you,

3157
01:17:42,951 --> 01:17:43,311
what do you,

3158
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:44,210
what do you do for a living?

3159
01:17:45,660 --> 01:17:46,040
Uh,

3160
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:47,480
do a radio show on the Internet.

3161
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:48,980
Like as I say that,

3162
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:51,170
like a leave out the UFC,

3163
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:52,520
I'll leave out standup comedy.

3164
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:52,671
Like,

3165
01:17:52,671 --> 01:17:53,790
I don't want this,

3166
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,850
just this ain't the,

3167
01:17:54,851 --> 01:17:56,060
the bridge between us.

3168
01:17:56,061 --> 01:17:57,020
It's too far.

3169
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:58,363
There's no,

3170
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,450
there's no room there.

3171
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:00,650
Some folks just,

3172
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,090
they don't want any thrills.

3173
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,170
They want no thrills.

3174
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,130
They want no,

3175
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:05,300
nothing dangerous.

3176
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:08,000
They want to see everything
to be spelled out for them.

3177
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:08,650
They want,

3178
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:08,900
you know,

3179
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:12,290
two weeks paid vacation and they want
to make sure that they could retire when

3180
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:15,020
they're 65 and they're
already ready to die.

3181
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:16,580
Like they've got it all set up.

3182
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:17,443
You betcha.

3183
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:19,093
You betcha.

3184
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:20,013
Yeah.

3185
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:20,350
So,

3186
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:20,580
well,

3187
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:20,790
what's,

3188
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:22,820
what's the best story for Baja?

3189
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,110
Cause I told my crazy story,

3190
01:18:24,111 --> 01:18:24,680
but you have the,

3191
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:25,501
you have better stories.

3192
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:26,090
You've been well,

3193
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:26,421
you know,

3194
01:18:26,421 --> 01:18:27,254
actually I think I'm,

3195
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:30,260
I've been honestly fortunate enough
when I started going to Baja,

3196
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:31,680
I went with Walker Evans and,

3197
01:18:31,681 --> 01:18:35,210
and people that have tons of experience
down there and they kind of help

3198
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:37,790
minimize those stories for me.

3199
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,683
Um,

3200
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:39,673
you know,

3201
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,900
one of the early days racing class,

3202
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:46,640
one single buggy single seat or only
one person in there down there after San

3203
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:46,641
Javier.

3204
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:46,731
Well,

3205
01:18:46,731 --> 01:18:47,930
you're talking about earlier,

3206
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,970
he had a flat tire and uh,

3207
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,770
got out to change that tire and had a,

3208
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:52,850
you know,

3209
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,390
the motors running in the buggy and,

3210
01:18:54,391 --> 01:18:56,210
and you can't hear anybody around you.

3211
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:56,761
There's typically,

3212
01:18:56,761 --> 01:18:57,021
there's no,

3213
01:18:57,021 --> 01:18:59,720
I thought it was in the middle of nowhere
and all of a sudden say somebody came

3214
01:18:59,721 --> 01:18:59,901
up,

3215
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:00,990
tapped me on the back of the shoulders,

3216
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,510
scare this crap out of me.

3217
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,320
Um,

3218
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:03,891
things like that.

3219
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:03,951
I,

3220
01:19:03,951 --> 01:19:04,370
I don't,

3221
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:04,970
you know,

3222
01:19:04,970 --> 01:19:05,803
crashing,

3223
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,740
uh,

3224
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:09,260
I've done multiple crashes
all over the place,

3225
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:10,280
Wad and stuff up.

3226
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:11,750
I'm breaking my collarbone.

3227
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:12,770
Um,

3228
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:14,000
the crazy stories I guess,

3229
01:19:14,001 --> 01:19:14,241
you know,

3230
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:14,470
I,

3231
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:14,790
I,

3232
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:16,040
I don't have the wild ones.

3233
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:17,750
The reason why is I think that I,

3234
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:18,111
you know,

3235
01:19:18,111 --> 01:19:18,980
I go down there prepared,

3236
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:19,814
I'm there to win.

3237
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:20,960
Um,

3238
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,111
you know,

3239
01:19:21,111 --> 01:19:24,470
I try to really minimize all that stuff
and haven't had a hottest crazy stuff

3240
01:19:24,471 --> 01:19:24,950
happened.

3241
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:27,050
Did you get involved in
other motor sports first?

3242
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:28,710
Will you involve regular racing first?

3243
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:28,870
Yeah,

3244
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:31,220
I started racing motorcycles
when I was eight,

3245
01:19:31,221 --> 01:19:31,431
nine,

3246
01:19:31,431 --> 01:19:32,180
10 years old.

3247
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:36,400
They got this Christ Yak racing
motorcycles is an eight year old.

3248
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,030
Got Involved in doing that.

3249
01:19:38,031 --> 01:19:38,271
And you know,

3250
01:19:38,271 --> 01:19:41,420
my dad was involved in do an off road
racing and the early seventies when I was

3251
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:42,201
on motorcycles.

3252
01:19:42,201 --> 01:19:44,720
And then when I got turned 16 years old,

3253
01:19:44,721 --> 01:19:47,750
we got an interracial and buggies
doing the mint 400 stuff like that.

3254
01:19:47,751 --> 01:19:48,620
And you know,

3255
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,740
I quit my senior year of basketball
is the dumbest thing I ever did.

3256
01:19:51,741 --> 01:19:52,820
I should've played it through,

3257
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:55,160
but I fell in love with
off road racing and then,

3258
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:55,340
uh,

3259
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:55,581
you know,

3260
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:56,420
just made it,

3261
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,580
made it my hobby there
for a few years and then,

3262
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:00,290
and got lucky enough to get picked up by,

3263
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:00,740
uh,

3264
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:02,030
people like Ford Motor Company,

3265
01:20:02,031 --> 01:20:03,080
BF Goodrich tires.

3266
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,940
And I ended up making a career out of it.

3267
01:20:04,941 --> 01:20:05,600
So,

3268
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,090
um,

3269
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:06,711
I've been doing,

3270
01:20:06,711 --> 01:20:07,080
uh,

3271
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,250
doing this for a living
for over 20 years and,

3272
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:10,200
and like Bud said,

3273
01:20:10,201 --> 01:20:13,260
we've won over 200 races
on BF Goodrich tires.

3274
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:17,340
I'm actually about 280 total wins
and off road since 80 to over 20

3275
01:20:17,341 --> 01:20:18,240
championships.

3276
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:21,570
And if you had to stop and you
had to go and live and office job,

3277
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,120
like if someone came along
and BF Goodrich said,

3278
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:24,870
look,

3279
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:26,430
we're taking you out of the fucking heat.

3280
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,210
It's just,

3281
01:20:27,210 --> 01:20:28,140
it's too crazy.

3282
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:30,240
We're going to give you a nice cushy job.

3283
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,880
Stop six figure salary.

3284
01:20:33,390 --> 01:20:34,410
Nice House.

3285
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:34,611
Yeah.

3286
01:20:34,611 --> 01:20:35,011
At this point,

3287
01:20:35,011 --> 01:20:36,060
I can't even imagine that,

3288
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:36,241
you know,

3289
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:37,290
I think about that,

3290
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:37,740
you know,

3291
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,461
every once in a what a,

3292
01:20:38,461 --> 01:20:41,520
what am I going to do when
this is over and I don't know.

3293
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:42,720
I don't even know what I'm going to do,

3294
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,290
but,

3295
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:43,501
you know,

3296
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:46,140
hopefully go to work with
somebody like BF Goodrich or,

3297
01:20:46,610 --> 01:20:46,950
um,

3298
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:47,161
you know,

3299
01:20:47,161 --> 01:20:48,120
my family owns a,

3300
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:50,790
an offer buggy shop in
Vegas doing stuff like that.

3301
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:51,450
But um,

3302
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:51,631
you know,

3303
01:20:51,631 --> 01:20:53,070
I don't plan on quitting anytime soon.

3304
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:53,904
It's what I know.

3305
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:54,331
And you know,

3306
01:20:54,331 --> 01:20:54,541
it's,

3307
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:56,100
it's almost all I know.

3308
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:56,341
I mean,

3309
01:20:56,341 --> 01:20:56,850
I have,

3310
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:57,720
it's my hobby.

3311
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:58,561
It's my job.

3312
01:20:58,561 --> 01:20:59,370
It's my life.

3313
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:00,570
Who's the oldest guy that can do it?

3314
01:21:00,571 --> 01:21:03,180
You were saying that that
Newman did it when he was 80.

3315
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,650
He did.

3316
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:04,110
He do.

3317
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:05,310
He did a race when he was 80.

3318
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:08,310
What a fucking animal he was
and I haven't met Stuart did it.

3319
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:11,010
I mean he did it until in
his sixties Walker Evans,

3320
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:12,690
Larry Ragland some of
the best of the sport,

3321
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:12,991
you know,

3322
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:14,280
had their most success in their,

3323
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,850
their 50s which I haven't got there
yet so I'm hoping to calm down.

3324
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:19,680
You calm down.

3325
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:20,050
You did.

3326
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:22,680
There's a thing in our race
racing called red mist.

3327
01:21:22,681 --> 01:21:23,670
Read Miss will get you hurt.

3328
01:21:23,671 --> 01:21:27,240
Like Jesse James goes down there all
the time and generally wads it up in the

3329
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:31,860
first hundred miles compensated by
Jesse James because he just goes crazy.

3330
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:32,161
No,

3331
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:34,230
because people misunderstand the race.

3332
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,210
I mean he knows more about the races.

3333
01:21:36,211 --> 01:21:39,090
I bet they misunderstand the race that
they think in the first hundred miles.

3334
01:21:39,091 --> 01:21:40,110
I got to beat everybody.

3335
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:42,840
The analogy that I have is
when they put their helmet on,

3336
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:44,660
they throw their brains
out the window and,

3337
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,500
and I did that when I was young.

3338
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,080
Crash.

3339
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,090
A lot of stuff ruined,

3340
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:48,781
ruined cars.

3341
01:21:48,781 --> 01:21:50,520
But over time you learn.

3342
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:52,050
That's not how you win the race.

3343
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:55,980
You basically go as slow
as you possibly can to win.

3344
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,380
You have to keep an eye
on your competition.

3345
01:21:58,381 --> 01:21:59,161
You go through the pitch,

3346
01:21:59,161 --> 01:21:59,881
get split times,

3347
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:00,810
find out how you're doing,

3348
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,090
but as long as you're,

3349
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:02,993
you know,

3350
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,490
you're close to winning the race,

3351
01:22:05,491 --> 01:22:06,600
you're doing a good job.

3352
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:08,370
When you get down to the end,

3353
01:22:08,371 --> 01:22:11,250
that's typical only you and a couple of
the guys that are racing for the win,

3354
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:13,750
all those other 2030
guys in your class there,

3355
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,390
they're broke or they're having problems.

3356
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:17,950
How many people are racing like when,

3357
01:22:17,951 --> 01:22:18,721
when they say ready,

3358
01:22:18,721 --> 01:22:18,991
set,

3359
01:22:18,991 --> 01:22:19,261
go.

3360
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:22,380
How many people fucking
hundred 50 and all the classes?

3361
01:22:22,381 --> 01:22:25,280
150 to 350 depends on which
way is like the thousands.

3362
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:26,970
Like 300 to 350 people.

3363
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:28,920
So there was vehicles.

3364
01:22:28,921 --> 01:22:29,370
Yeah.

3365
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:32,220
So 350 vehicles all together.

3366
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,063
Bob,

3367
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:34,620
how does it,

3368
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:35,580
how does it set,

3369
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:39,480
I mean how many lanes are you're dealing
with here when they start the race,

3370
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:41,461
when the,

3371
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:42,241
when they start the race,

3372
01:22:42,241 --> 01:22:45,030
they send one one truck
or one buggy at a time,

3373
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,560
usually every 30 seconds apart.

3374
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:47,820
Racing the clock.

3375
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,950
We're out racing on the
track at the same time.

3376
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,870
You do have to come up
and bump those guys,

3377
01:22:51,871 --> 01:22:53,940
move out of your way if they're
slower than in front of you.

3378
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:54,541
But,

3379
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:54,810
um,

3380
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:54,991
you know,

3381
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:58,560
we're racing the clock and
as you get down the course,

3382
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,970
the bike start,

3383
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:00,721
usually the bikes,

3384
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:03,330
the quads and Utvs they started
about three hours in front of the,

3385
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,040
the first four wheel vehicle.

3386
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,550
But we ended up catching those guys.

3387
01:23:06,551 --> 01:23:08,080
And that's where it
becomes really sketchy.

3388
01:23:08,081 --> 01:23:09,280
And sometimes were these,

3389
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,240
you know,

3390
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,560
bud story earlier when,

3391
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:12,250
when,

3392
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,230
when Josh and Josh at the bike guys,

3393
01:23:14,231 --> 01:23:16,360
because the bikes can't do certain things.

3394
01:23:16,361 --> 01:23:17,680
Well some of them can do.

3395
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:17,951
Yeah,

3396
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:18,850
some of them can.

3397
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:19,570
Um,

3398
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:20,321
but a lot of the,

3399
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:21,101
especially in Mexico,

3400
01:23:21,101 --> 01:23:23,230
a lot of the bike guys are or sportsmen's.

3401
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:24,160
Um,

3402
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:25,390
and when you're doing a long race,

3403
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,530
like the Baja 1000,

3404
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:27,220
um,

3405
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,300
it becomes more,

3406
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:28,900
uh,

3407
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:29,620
the bike guys.

3408
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:32,790
You know they get used up
quicker and the trucks,

3409
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,270
you're sitting in the seat,

3410
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:36,250
you know you don't have air
conditioner but you've got,

3411
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,510
you know you can have snacks,

3412
01:23:37,511 --> 01:23:38,051
you can have food,

3413
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:40,180
you can have water as you're racing
down the course of the bike guy.

3414
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:42,460
It's just him and a small light.

3415
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,970
You know I talked earlier about how the
lights on our trucks are like a stadium.

3416
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,560
They have one light,

3417
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,050
we have 14 to 20 lights on our trucks.

3418
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:53,200
It's a lot different and
fuck that must be scary.

3419
01:23:53,201 --> 01:23:54,420
Driving a motorcycle fast.

3420
01:23:54,450 --> 01:23:57,880
They think of baseball stadiums behind
them sometimes I hear at trophy truck

3421
01:23:57,881 --> 01:23:58,241
behind him.

3422
01:23:58,241 --> 01:23:58,901
Some of the guys,

3423
01:23:58,901 --> 01:23:59,550
the smart ones,

3424
01:23:59,550 --> 01:24:00,311
oh they freak out.

3425
01:24:00,311 --> 01:24:02,080
They look behind them like Ooh Shit.

3426
01:24:02,081 --> 01:24:04,480
And they'd get off the road and the
trophic go to blowing by him cause they

3427
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:05,314
don't want to get run over.

3428
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,510
I mean there's a lot there.

3429
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,360
A lot of accidents with the
bike guys and they're there.

3430
01:24:09,390 --> 01:24:12,280
I score is doing a lot of things to
to mitigate that at this point they're

3431
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:12,951
starting them later.

3432
01:24:12,951 --> 01:24:14,860
We're going to start it the
night before and stuff like that.

3433
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:16,241
For me,

3434
01:24:16,241 --> 01:24:17,230
there's an interesting thing for me.

3435
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:17,711
I was going to tell you,

3436
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:18,640
like I'm known,

3437
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:19,481
you know me for a long,

3438
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:19,931
long time,

3439
01:24:19,931 --> 01:24:22,600
I've known kindly like
kind of a crazy jackass.

3440
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,850
It doesn't do this when
I'm going down the races.

3441
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:25,151
You,

3442
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:27,020
you talked about the catheters.

3443
01:24:27,021 --> 01:24:29,080
There's an interesting to
happens to me and my psyche.

3444
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:30,460
I'm wearing a fire suit.

3445
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,290
I have my catheters on,

3446
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:35,230
I have a fireproof underwear.

3447
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:36,160
I put my helmet on,

3448
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:38,590
I got my knife in my pocket so
I can cut my seat belts off.

3449
01:24:38,591 --> 01:24:39,450
Anything else happens.

3450
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:40,480
I started doing all this stuff.

3451
01:24:40,481 --> 01:24:41,314
I'm like,

3452
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,310
Holy Shit,

3453
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:43,570
I'm doing something pretty serious.

3454
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,650
And I calmed down.

3455
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:48,040
I have problems with my sponsors who
hang out with me and they're like,

3456
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,570
you're,

3457
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:49,750
you're going to fucking wreck.

3458
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:53,230
You're a crazy wacky idiot
who's gonna wreck the car.

3459
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:54,213
So they don't,

3460
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:54,511
they,

3461
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:56,890
they're not managing this craziness.

3462
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:57,933
Well,

3463
01:24:58,030 --> 01:24:58,391
what do you mean?

3464
01:24:58,391 --> 01:24:58,750
It is?

3465
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,610
Like some people just don't,

3466
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,660
some people just can't like look
at all the different variables.

3467
01:25:04,661 --> 01:25:06,520
Look with all the craziness
and just settle in.

3468
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:06,791
Okay,

3469
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:07,810
this is what we're doing now.

3470
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:08,420
Yeah.

3471
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:08,800
Some people,

3472
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,670
and it's hard to read.

3473
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,500
Miss comes in like you your son.

3474
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:12,190
And I've get,

3475
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,450
I get caught up sometimes too,

3476
01:25:13,451 --> 01:25:15,130
cause I had a guy pull behind me one time,

3477
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,740
a French guy until he's gonna
kick my ass if I don't move.

3478
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:19,300
I said we'll stop the car.

3479
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,433
I'll stop the car,

3480
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,640
get out and I don't care.

3481
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:22,900
We'll stop right in the middle of quarter.

3482
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:23,860
You're going to kick my ass.

3483
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:24,880
Fucking French.

3484
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:26,441
French.

3485
01:25:26,441 --> 01:25:29,670
They gave us these fries and
now they got at Delta my way.

3486
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:30,820
I'll kick your ass.

3487
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,500
That's what he's saying on the radio.

3488
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:32,711
I'm like,

3489
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,900
fuck you out of the way.

3490
01:25:34,901 --> 01:25:37,150
I'll kick your ass and
I know what he's doing.

3491
01:25:37,151 --> 01:25:41,260
He's freaking how out and he's in this
race and you just got to pace yourself.

3492
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,400
You get to be calm.

3493
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:45,850
It's hard not to get caught up in the
beginning when guys are banging on you

3494
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:46,780
like they're hitting you.

3495
01:25:46,781 --> 01:25:47,561
I don't understand.

3496
01:25:47,561 --> 01:25:47,890
You don't,

3497
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:50,110
some people hit hard.

3498
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,080
They need Roman to,

3499
01:25:51,081 --> 01:25:53,020
you could try to get you out of the way.

3500
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:53,291
Yeah,

3501
01:25:53,291 --> 01:25:53,491
it just,

3502
01:25:53,491 --> 01:25:54,070
they don't even care.

3503
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,611
Then it'll honk.

3504
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:55,444
You just drive also,

3505
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,453
boom.

3506
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,050
Being rear ended the four
or five at 60 miles an hour.

3507
01:25:59,051 --> 01:25:59,410
You're like,

3508
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:00,520
Holy Shit.

3509
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:00,731
Yeah.

3510
01:26:00,731 --> 01:26:02,260
The off road trucks or one lane,

3511
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,190
it's not like five lanes
on the four oh five

3512
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:04,881
it's one lane.

3513
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:06,010
So to past that guy,

3514
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,011
you come up there,

3515
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:09,470
you hope he moves out of the way
typically doesn't really want to.

3516
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:12,050
So you got to come up there and bump
them and sometimes people get out of

3517
01:26:12,051 --> 01:26:13,430
control and they hit you really hard.

3518
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:15,050
They try to move you off the track.

3519
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:19,280
Especially if it's a jackass like these
guys who've actually had a bad day.

3520
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:19,800
So this is what I,

3521
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:20,631
the problem I have.

3522
01:26:20,631 --> 01:26:20,871
Right?

3523
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:21,704
So they've had a bit,

3524
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:22,550
I'm having a good day.

3525
01:26:22,551 --> 01:26:22,821
Right?

3526
01:26:22,821 --> 01:26:24,110
So I'm in front of my class.

3527
01:26:24,290 --> 01:26:25,880
He's had a bad day and a trophy truck.

3528
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:27,290
He's got 900 horsepower,

3529
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,850
105 gallons of fuel.

3530
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,380
He's fucking pissed off.

3531
01:26:30,381 --> 01:26:31,101
He's tired,

3532
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:32,540
he's not happy anymore.

3533
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:34,610
And he's trying to make up time.

3534
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:35,540
And then there's,

3535
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:38,390
me and my buggy are going to want
to deal with these slow guys.

3536
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:39,730
We want to get to the,

3537
01:26:39,740 --> 01:26:40,550
we want to get done,

3538
01:26:40,550 --> 01:26:41,760
we want to get to the finish line.

3539
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:45,530
And the dust that he's kicking up makes
the trophy truck guy pissed off and it's

3540
01:26:45,531 --> 01:26:46,670
like you don't deserve to be here.

3541
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:47,331
Get Out of my way.

3542
01:26:47,331 --> 01:26:48,350
And by the time you get to them,

3543
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:49,840
you give them a little low.

3544
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:50,833
A little low.

3545
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:52,401
That's the bump.

3546
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:53,030
That's the bump.

3547
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:53,750
Oh yeah.

3548
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:56,240
And how many guys get
fucked up because of that?

3549
01:26:56,510 --> 01:27:00,140
I mean it seems like that would be one
of the reasons why a lot of guys wreck,

3550
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:00,381
well,

3551
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:01,190
a lot of the cars there,

3552
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,360
they're built to take that.

3553
01:27:02,361 --> 01:27:02,461
It's,

3554
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:03,770
it's in the DNA of off road.

3555
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:04,041
That's,

3556
01:27:04,041 --> 01:27:05,110
that's Kinda how we pass.

3557
01:27:05,111 --> 01:27:05,944
You come up there,

3558
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,660
you bump into each other tagging.

3559
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,701
That's your,

3560
01:27:08,701 --> 01:27:09,000
you know,

3561
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:09,440
your,

3562
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:10,160
I caught you.

3563
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:11,060
Now you move out of the way.

3564
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:11,721
Let me go buy it.

3565
01:27:11,721 --> 01:27:12,381
That's what we do.

3566
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:13,280
So you guys use,

3567
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:18,310
there were chromoly tubing into chromoly
tubing designed to take a good impact,

3568
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:19,731
but you,

3569
01:27:19,731 --> 01:27:21,130
you would pull over the side.

3570
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:22,713
Yeah,

3571
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:23,653
exactly.

3572
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:25,330
Like a 1950s dad,

3573
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:26,803
get rid of

3574
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:28,520
you.

3575
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,660
If you were in the accident,

3576
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:30,494
if you were on the forum,

3577
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:31,760
if someone hit you that hard,

3578
01:27:31,761 --> 01:27:34,340
you pull over and call the cops
and grabbed your neck and go,

3579
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:34,791
whoa.

3580
01:27:34,791 --> 01:27:35,720
That was an impact.

3581
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:36,970
Oh yeah.

3582
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:38,390
Part of the game as part of the game.

3583
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:39,813
Wow.

3584
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:40,560
That's crazy.

3585
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:40,750
That's,

3586
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,130
it seems so bizarre.

3587
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:42,831
That's,

3588
01:27:42,831 --> 01:27:46,570
he just seems so crazy that part of it
is just ramming into you while you're

3589
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:47,404
going,

3590
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:48,190
you know,

3591
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:49,510
x amount of miles an hour.

3592
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:50,733
Right?

3593
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:52,203
It's normal.

3594
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:53,710
It's not normal.

3595
01:27:53,711 --> 01:27:55,030
It's normal in that world,

3596
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:55,721
in that world,

3597
01:27:55,721 --> 01:27:56,554
it's normal.

3598
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,620
We were fucking human beings
are so crazy in that way.

3599
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,800
We just find normalcy in the fact that,

3600
01:28:02,801 --> 01:28:03,070
well,

3601
01:28:03,070 --> 01:28:04,870
this is what happens when you do this.

3602
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,790
And then all rules,

3603
01:28:06,791 --> 01:28:07,690
all decor,

3604
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:12,720
all normal rules of behavior go out the
window when you're racing in a Baja and

3605
01:28:12,851 --> 01:28:13,940
you're pissing through your fucking can

3606
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:14,391
shoe.

3607
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:15,930
And well,

3608
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:17,223
I think there's,

3609
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:17,481
there's,

3610
01:28:17,481 --> 01:28:18,680
if there's a very weird,

3611
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,580
I get some something in the psych.

3612
01:28:20,581 --> 01:28:22,700
I can tell you from me once,

3613
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,360
once you figured this out and you've
done the organization and you've gone to

3614
01:28:26,361 --> 01:28:26,961
your catheter,

3615
01:28:26,961 --> 01:28:27,501
to your knife,

3616
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:28,340
you got your chase team,

3617
01:28:28,341 --> 01:28:29,001
you've got your feel.

3618
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:32,030
Once you've organized successful
race campaign like he has,

3619
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:34,040
then wreck regular life and business.

3620
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:34,940
It's not that hard,

3621
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:35,390
right?

3622
01:28:35,390 --> 01:28:35,871
You actually,

3623
01:28:35,871 --> 01:28:37,460
you get out of a race and he's like,

3624
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:40,720
then then actually you sometimes get
a little short with stupid people and

3625
01:28:40,721 --> 01:28:40,941
you're like,

3626
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:41,241
really?

3627
01:28:41,241 --> 01:28:44,900
You just had to go to the store and pick
up a six pack and come back was that,

3628
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:46,880
that's fucking hard and cause what we do,

3629
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:48,710
there's so many consequences.

3630
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:50,870
He can tell a guy and this
is actually how it goes to.

3631
01:28:50,871 --> 01:28:52,910
It's like I need you to go
to the [inaudible] station,

3632
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,320
which is the gas station in Mexico.

3633
01:28:54,410 --> 01:28:56,510
Be there at one o'clock
with some extra tires.

3634
01:28:56,511 --> 01:29:00,200
Got May need when I get out and that's
what you tell the guy and it's 800 miles

3635
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:02,660
away and you don't see
that guy until 800 motel,

3636
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,940
you know for 12 hours from there
and that guy is sitting there.

3637
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,710
It is logistics crazy and you surround
yourself with the people who know have a

3638
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:11,580
common goal.

3639
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:13,410
Your logistics are all point out.

3640
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:14,880
I mean if you need anything down there,

3641
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:18,430
you know where it's at and you come
back to the states and you can't you and

3642
01:29:18,450 --> 01:29:21,360
like you know some of your employees or
someone like that can handle like two

3643
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:24,120
simple instructions or like that
guy would die down in Mexico.

3644
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:25,270
Well it's just the

3645
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:26,960
stakes are higher,

3646
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:30,320
the pressure's higher
and everyone's tuned in.

3647
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:31,880
Everyone's tuned in.

3648
01:29:31,881 --> 01:29:33,110
Everyone has a goal.

3649
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:33,920
Yeah.

3650
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,430
You want to surround yourself with the
people who've been down there to Mexico.

3651
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:37,720
It's two lane highways.

3652
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:38,680
Very dangerous.

3653
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:40,990
There's not streetlights very rarely.

3654
01:29:40,991 --> 01:29:44,260
There's yellow line dividing
the center lane and you got,

3655
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:45,310
you got to have the right people.

3656
01:29:45,311 --> 01:29:45,411
It's,

3657
01:29:45,411 --> 01:29:46,990
it's a very dangerous things to legit.

3658
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:47,351
It is.

3659
01:29:47,351 --> 01:29:50,350
It's a logistics nightmare
to to plan out a race.

3660
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:51,730
I always say to people,

3661
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:52,361
if I,

3662
01:29:52,361 --> 01:29:57,220
if I would spend as much effort that I
do off road racing and putting the team

3663
01:29:57,221 --> 01:30:00,100
together and the logistics
in a regular business,

3664
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:01,240
I'd have a lot of money.

3665
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:04,660
Instead I race the trophy truck
and I don't have much money.

3666
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:05,241
Oh yeah,

3667
01:30:05,241 --> 01:30:05,421
no,

3668
01:30:05,421 --> 01:30:06,710
this makes ups look like,

3669
01:30:06,711 --> 01:30:07,520
I dunno,

3670
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,720
this is look real logistics.

3671
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,151
Yeah,

3672
01:30:09,151 --> 01:30:11,460
but would it be any more exciting?

3673
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,323
I mean,

3674
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:14,240
a lot of money would,

3675
01:30:14,890 --> 01:30:16,070
wouldn't be worth it.

3676
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:19,290
And I like this is a lot of people that
have a lot of money that we know they're

3677
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:20,760
just miserable as fuck.

3678
01:30:20,761 --> 01:30:22,860
They're all on
antidepressants and they're,

3679
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:26,880
they're always constantly in and out of
relationships in their life is a fucking

3680
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:29,460
holy rack of failure and catastrophe.

3681
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,470
But they're financially successful

3682
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,160
because they're not challenging
themselves and they're getting,

3683
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:34,630
it has to do with challenging yourself.

3684
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:34,971
Yeah,

3685
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:35,780
I think you're right.

3686
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:40,780
I think there's something about being
uncomfortable that provides you with a

3687
01:30:41,241 --> 01:30:42,920
certain sense of wellbeing.

3688
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,060
I don't,

3689
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,050
I don't know what it is,

3690
01:30:45,051 --> 01:30:45,650
but yeah,

3691
01:30:45,650 --> 01:30:47,900
I was hunting in Montana last year and,

3692
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:48,450
uh,

3693
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:51,260
we were talking about employees
doing things and this,

3694
01:30:51,261 --> 01:30:51,580
uh,

3695
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:54,290
the show mediator has
these guys at work for it.

3696
01:30:54,291 --> 01:30:54,500
I mean,

3697
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,820
I don't know what they get paid,

3698
01:30:55,821 --> 01:30:57,410
but I'm sure they don't get paid much.

3699
01:30:57,620 --> 01:31:02,620
And these guys are working
24 hours a day for the six,

3700
01:31:03,141 --> 01:31:04,280
seven days that we're there.

3701
01:31:04,281 --> 01:31:05,630
They're sleeping on the ground.

3702
01:31:05,631 --> 01:31:09,950
It's fucking zero degrees outside
there huddled up and sleeping bag.

3703
01:31:10,060 --> 01:31:12,770
They get up before everybody else
because they have to start the coffee,

3704
01:31:12,771 --> 01:31:14,260
they have to fire up the,

3705
01:31:14,261 --> 01:31:14,380
uh,

3706
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:15,460
the campfire and,

3707
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,270
and you know,

3708
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:21,320
have a job where someone doesn't
want to fucking clean the restroom.

3709
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:24,190
Someone does want to take out the
garbage and normal job where you,

3710
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:29,060
you show up at nine and you leave at
five and try getting people to work

3711
01:31:29,061 --> 01:31:34,061
throughout the day for what this guy gets
paid to be 24 hours a day in Montana,

3712
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:36,560
sleeping on the ground,

3713
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:37,513
freezing their dick.

3714
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:39,500
But that's what he's doing.

3715
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:41,030
Like that's what he's doing.

3716
01:31:41,031 --> 01:31:42,650
And in that world in,

3717
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:43,070
you know,

3718
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:45,890
he becomes a part of that production.

3719
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,100
Like this is what I'm doing now and
this guy that you're calling and saying,

3720
01:31:49,101 --> 01:31:49,640
hey,

3721
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:50,473
you know,

3722
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:51,980
go 800 miles,

3723
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,330
get some fucking tires,

3724
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:54,380
meet us there.

3725
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:55,730
Like that's what that guy's doing.

3726
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:56,990
And he's there and he's there.

3727
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:57,221
Yeah,

3728
01:31:57,221 --> 01:31:57,580
and you sit,

3729
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,350
I mean production like year,

3730
01:31:59,351 --> 01:32:01,780
I have a group and we did the F-150 thing,

3731
01:32:01,781 --> 01:32:03,130
they called it my production guys.

3732
01:32:03,131 --> 01:32:04,600
Like you've been around
production for awhile.

3733
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:09,250
My guys were up for 54 hours straight
and they call themselves to 54 our crew.

3734
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:09,501
Right.

3735
01:32:09,501 --> 01:32:10,870
Because they had the,

3736
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:14,170
we filmed this whole special for ESPN
and then they were filling my whole

3737
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:16,660
special for Ford and they
were up for 54 hours,

3738
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:17,800
not a complaint.

3739
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:19,520
They didn't like hit me for overtime.

3740
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:20,170
They're like,

3741
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:22,810
that was amazing and you've just got to
surround you and I don't care about the

3742
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:23,201
overtime.

3743
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:24,460
You've got to surround
yourself with people.

3744
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:27,130
Like I didn't know my race is
going to be that effing long.

3745
01:32:27,131 --> 01:32:27,341
I mean,

3746
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:28,600
we just happened to be,

3747
01:32:28,601 --> 01:32:28,751
you know,

3748
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:30,100
we took 42 hours to do it.

3749
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:32,770
These guys do it and 19
or something like that.

3750
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:33,751
But you,

3751
01:32:33,751 --> 01:32:35,530
you surround yourself with those people.

3752
01:32:35,531 --> 01:32:38,320
And I was going to say something
about our support staff is,

3753
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:38,651
you know,

3754
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:42,250
our chase crews are amazing because we
have volunteers like my brother comes out

3755
01:32:42,251 --> 01:32:42,581
every year.

3756
01:32:42,581 --> 01:32:44,020
It's something my
brother and I can do now.

3757
01:32:44,410 --> 01:32:46,990
They're chase crews are amazing
cause most of them are volunteers.

3758
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:48,130
They're going to come down there.

3759
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,720
They'll drive and dangerous roads.

3760
01:32:49,721 --> 01:32:50,050
They'll,

3761
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:51,430
they won't sleep at night.

3762
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:55,750
They'll be up for 36 hours and they eat
beef jerky and it's cold as shit and

3763
01:32:55,751 --> 01:32:57,100
they are always there.

3764
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:57,940
It's miserable.

3765
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,260
They hate it while it's happening.

3766
01:32:59,560 --> 01:33:00,410
But in the end you're,

3767
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,151
you get home,

3768
01:33:01,151 --> 01:33:02,530
you get rested up and you,

3769
01:33:02,590 --> 01:33:05,130
all the great stories
come out and you love it.

3770
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,310
You want to go back and do it again.

3771
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:07,220
Yup.

3772
01:33:07,220 --> 01:33:07,860
It's that,

3773
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:11,390
just that different level of life.

3774
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:13,880
It's like when you're
out there doing the race,

3775
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:15,230
you're out there doing some wild,

3776
01:33:15,231 --> 01:33:16,430
crazy shit like that.

3777
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,620
It's like everything's elevated.

3778
01:33:18,621 --> 01:33:20,060
You're more tuned in,

3779
01:33:20,061 --> 01:33:20,271
you're,

3780
01:33:20,271 --> 01:33:22,400
you're more aware of your surroundings.

3781
01:33:22,401 --> 01:33:27,180
You're not inundated by cell phones
and text messages and emails.

3782
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:28,110
They don't even work.

3783
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:28,870
Actually we,

3784
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:31,230
I have one phone and maybe a sat phone.

3785
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:32,041
I don't even return it.

3786
01:33:32,041 --> 01:33:32,281
I'm like,

3787
01:33:32,281 --> 01:33:32,930
I'm gone.

3788
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:33,061
Yeah.

3789
01:33:33,061 --> 01:33:33,721
Once you go to Mexico,

3790
01:33:33,721 --> 01:33:35,010
you call going to Mexico.

3791
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:35,470
Yup.

3792
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:35,941
He down there,

3793
01:33:35,941 --> 01:33:36,774
see when I get home.

3794
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:37,890
And that's part of it too,

3795
01:33:37,891 --> 01:33:38,161
right?

3796
01:33:38,161 --> 01:33:39,930
Part of it too is like the disconnect,

3797
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:40,530
unplug,

3798
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:42,540
unplugging and then,

3799
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:43,051
you know,

3800
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:48,051
recharging your brain and being out
there and the desolate surroundings go on

3801
01:33:48,121 --> 01:33:49,830
140 miles an hour over bumps.

3802
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:50,071
Well,

3803
01:33:50,071 --> 01:33:50,360
it gives you,

3804
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,290
there's another side of it too
that gives you appreciation.

3805
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:52,470
Not,

3806
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,701
you know,

3807
01:33:52,701 --> 01:33:53,040
I have,

3808
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:53,731
I have a kid now,

3809
01:33:53,731 --> 01:33:54,220
but I know my,

3810
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:55,260
my brother sends it to you.

3811
01:33:55,261 --> 01:33:55,430
See,

3812
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:55,861
you don't know.

3813
01:33:55,861 --> 01:33:56,910
You also see the people,

3814
01:33:56,911 --> 01:33:58,080
how they live there.

3815
01:33:58,081 --> 01:33:58,914
Our kids,

3816
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,080
amazing kids and they live in,

3817
01:34:01,170 --> 01:34:01,400
um,

3818
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:02,160
chicken coops,

3819
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:02,461
right?

3820
01:34:02,461 --> 01:34:03,840
The blue chicken coop down by a,

3821
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:04,620
um,

3822
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,453
a hose.

3823
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:06,570
They live in chicken coops.

3824
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:07,291
And I'm not kidding,

3825
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:08,790
I'm saying it's a blue chicken coop.

3826
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:09,570
That's what it is.

3827
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:11,220
And there's kids and I actually called,

3828
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:11,871
this is my,

3829
01:34:11,871 --> 01:34:12,900
my own little story,

3830
01:34:12,901 --> 01:34:13,711
but I,

3831
01:34:13,711 --> 01:34:14,041
there's,

3832
01:34:14,041 --> 01:34:14,370
there's,

3833
01:34:14,370 --> 01:34:15,180
there's um,

3834
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,250
the kids that never grew
up always come out of Ohio.

3835
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:19,720
So there's this little road after
you turned down to blue date,

3836
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:21,480
the Blue Gate on the right hand side,

3837
01:34:21,481 --> 01:34:25,950
there's a blue chicken coop and it looks
like every year for 10 years the same

3838
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:26,580
kids come out.

3839
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,450
They never get older,

3840
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,650
they don't have shoes.

3841
01:34:28,950 --> 01:34:29,910
They're smiling.

3842
01:34:29,911 --> 01:34:30,780
We hand up stickers.

3843
01:34:30,781 --> 01:34:31,321
I stopped him,

3844
01:34:31,321 --> 01:34:31,651
give him,

3845
01:34:31,651 --> 01:34:32,461
I give him candy,

3846
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:33,294
I talked to him,

3847
01:34:33,570 --> 01:34:34,740
he signs autographs,

3848
01:34:34,741 --> 01:34:35,574
you take pictures,

3849
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,950
you go back the next year they
look the same age and they,

3850
01:34:38,951 --> 01:34:39,784
and they live.

3851
01:34:39,890 --> 01:34:40,220
Joe,

3852
01:34:40,220 --> 01:34:41,340
I'm telling you chicken coop,

3853
01:34:41,341 --> 01:34:42,300
I can draw it for you,

3854
01:34:42,301 --> 01:34:42,481
right?

3855
01:34:42,481 --> 01:34:42,920
It's,

3856
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:45,090
it's a fucking chicken coop
and it looks like it's,

3857
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:46,941
it's a chicken coop,

3858
01:34:46,941 --> 01:34:47,611
but it's not funny.

3859
01:34:47,611 --> 01:34:48,960
But you appreciate,

3860
01:34:48,961 --> 01:34:51,510
you come back and sometimes you
look at your kids and other people,

3861
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:51,991
kids make,

3862
01:34:51,991 --> 01:34:54,650
you have no idea how he's your habit.

3863
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:54,900
Yeah.

3864
01:34:54,900 --> 01:34:55,890
And then sometimes the kid,

3865
01:34:55,891 --> 01:34:59,300
the chicken people go to the dump and
that's where they find metal and they find

3866
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:02,450
scrap and they take the aluminum cans and
they get their money and they're happy

3867
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:02,750
to,

3868
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:03,260
they're happy.

3869
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:03,590
They don't,

3870
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:04,341
they're not negative,

3871
01:35:04,341 --> 01:35:05,880
they're not pissed off there.

3872
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:07,510
They have no shoes and,

3873
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,640
and you know the Baja racers do a
lot for the community down there.

3874
01:35:10,641 --> 01:35:11,474
I mean sometimes they'll,

3875
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:11,840
they'll,

3876
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,370
they'll build orphanages.

3877
01:35:13,371 --> 01:35:16,490
I mean a lot of the Baja guys get touched
by what happens down there and the

3878
01:35:16,491 --> 01:35:20,570
people down there and they go give back
cause it you can't help but you know,

3879
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:22,430
you can't help but go to these.

3880
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,350
It's a third world country a lot,

3881
01:35:24,351 --> 01:35:24,960
a lot of ways,

3882
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,360
not cabo and stuff like that.

3883
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:27,780
But the places where we go and you,

3884
01:35:27,781 --> 01:35:28,760
you get affected by it.

3885
01:35:28,761 --> 01:35:32,120
You get to see the other world and
you do appreciate what we have.

3886
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,040
Our kids will never
appreciate it cause you know,

3887
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:35,840
the 500 shoes,

3888
01:35:36,260 --> 01:35:37,340
these kids have no shoes.

3889
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:38,180
Seriously.

3890
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:40,310
No shoes in the live in
chicken coops with a,

3891
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:41,780
a sheet on the front

3892
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:42,623
door.

3893
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:43,561
Yeah.

3894
01:35:43,561 --> 01:35:44,160
I've been,

3895
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:45,720
I've driven in New Mexico,

3896
01:35:45,721 --> 01:35:47,300
a POW pass Tiawana.

3897
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:49,800
I'm into some really sketchy areas.

3898
01:35:49,801 --> 01:35:54,150
And you get to see these people that
are living in these houses that are

3899
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,970
essentially like cardboard
boxes with no windows.

3900
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:58,171
And you know,

3901
01:35:58,171 --> 01:36:03,060
you see these small villages of places
like that and it really puts it into

3902
01:36:03,061 --> 01:36:03,894
perspective.

3903
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:07,680
And even more weird that that's
connected to the United States.

3904
01:36:07,681 --> 01:36:09,450
It's just one of the
richest countries on earth.

3905
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,980
It's just you just drive.

3906
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,660
It's like same landmass.

3907
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:12,901
Yep.

3908
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:13,740
Just keep going.

3909
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:18,240
And he'd go from southern California
with the fucking Kardashians live and you

3910
01:36:18,241 --> 01:36:22,950
see a Rolls Royce in your neighborhood
and then a couple hours drive,

3911
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:26,040
and then all of a sudden you're in a
third world country where no one has shoes

3912
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:26,874
and was an advantage.

3913
01:36:27,070 --> 01:36:27,650
You'd go through,

3914
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:28,800
you'd go through the gate of Teal on,

3915
01:36:28,801 --> 01:36:31,830
you take a right and you go up
this hill and it is a marsh.

3916
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:34,050
So you're in Tijuana and you're right,

3917
01:36:34,051 --> 01:36:38,070
you have the cardboard boxes and you
look off to your right and there's a $20

3918
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:39,930
million beach house sitting
there and you can see it.

3919
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,520
Imagine waking up every day.

3920
01:36:41,521 --> 01:36:44,400
You're up on this hill and
Tiawana no running water.

3921
01:36:44,401 --> 01:36:45,030
Everything's happened.

3922
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,391
You look up,

3923
01:36:45,391 --> 01:36:46,830
there's a $20 million beach house.

3924
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:47,810
Dang boy.

3925
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:48,490
He puts his,

3926
01:36:48,490 --> 01:36:49,570
a Mexican,

3927
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,320
no states.

3928
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:51,940
Yeah.

3929
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:52,250
Yeah.

3930
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:53,720
So you can see San Diego.

3931
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:54,230
Yeah.

3932
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:55,130
You call up on this hill,

3933
01:36:55,131 --> 01:36:55,491
you can see,

3934
01:36:55,491 --> 01:36:55,680
say,

3935
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:56,451
look off to the right there.

3936
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:57,910
San Diego in 20 there.

3937
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:58,873
It's right there.

3938
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,211
Yeah.

3939
01:36:59,211 --> 01:37:00,530
That is fucking bananas.

3940
01:37:00,531 --> 01:37:01,250
La Jolla.

3941
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,840
Like those houses in La Jolla.

3942
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:04,130
We should do the comedy store.

3943
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:04,640
And we,

3944
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:04,941
you know,

3945
01:37:04,941 --> 01:37:05,960
look at La Jolla.

3946
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:07,490
I mean,

3947
01:37:07,491 --> 01:37:08,960
they have palaces.

3948
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:13,910
These palaces overlooking the ocean and
the most incredible affluent community.

3949
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:16,520
Everyone's driving around
these expensive European cars.

3950
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:20,060
And you're 20 minutes away from Tijuana.

3951
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:21,020
Yup.

3952
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:21,980
20 minutes.

3953
01:37:22,610 --> 01:37:23,570
That's fucking crazy.

3954
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:25,760
That's like from here driving a van eyes,

3955
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:26,830
you know,

3956
01:37:26,830 --> 01:37:26,961
and,

3957
01:37:26,961 --> 01:37:29,810
but except you're driving
to one of the worst spots,

3958
01:37:29,930 --> 01:37:31,460
one of the worst border towns.

3959
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:33,123
Yup.

3960
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:33,650
On Earth.

3961
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:35,180
But the people are amazing.

3962
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:36,260
The people help us.

3963
01:37:36,261 --> 01:37:37,140
They do so much for,

3964
01:37:37,170 --> 01:37:41,330
so it's pretty fucking bad ass
to Mexican fucking throw down.

3965
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:42,223
Tacos,

3966
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,273
shrimp,

3967
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:44,301
everything.

3968
01:37:44,301 --> 01:37:44,721
Lobster,

3969
01:37:44,721 --> 01:37:45,060
lobster,

3970
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:45,381
tacos.

3971
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:45,950
Where's the lofts?

3972
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:48,320
Tacos at a lots of Tacos.

3973
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:51,380
I forgot what it was at
Mama's Mama's Tom Espinosas.

3974
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:52,610
Mama Espinosa had lofts.

3975
01:37:52,611 --> 01:37:54,160
Your tacos are amazing now.

3976
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,250
You never get to stop that music a car.

3977
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:57,510
Now do any,

3978
01:37:57,511 --> 01:37:57,900
um,

3979
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,460
Mexicans race.

3980
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,420
Absolutely.

3981
01:38:00,420 --> 01:38:02,340
There's a lot of people
that live in Mexico.

3982
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:03,210
The join in on this.

3983
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:03,450
Yup.

3984
01:38:03,450 --> 01:38:04,283
Have you ever want it?

3985
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,040
Oh yeah,

3986
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:05,250
no,

3987
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,011
it actually did a very,

3988
01:38:06,011 --> 01:38:07,430
a Taco villa dosa one.

3989
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:09,860
He's a part of the Red Bull
Team on the 50th anniversary.

3990
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:10,291
I'm sorry,

3991
01:38:10,291 --> 01:38:10,591
it wasn't,

3992
01:38:10,591 --> 01:38:11,970
it was the Mexican independence.

3993
01:38:11,990 --> 01:38:12,280
Yep.

3994
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,280
That was him and his father.

3995
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:14,880
Um,

3996
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:15,750
Gus wanted,

3997
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,171
and they're,

3998
01:38:16,171 --> 01:38:16,470
they're,

3999
01:38:16,470 --> 01:38:16,771
they,

4000
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:17,604
they're from,

4001
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:18,660
they're from Tijuana.

4002
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:19,620
They're from that area.

4003
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,400
Um,

4004
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,151
and there's also one,

4005
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:22,860
Carlos Lopez is a lot of Mexican teams.

4006
01:38:22,861 --> 01:38:24,840
I mean Lexican teams
get a little resources.

4007
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:25,530
They go race.

4008
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:26,280
And by the way,

4009
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:27,600
they are definitely race trophy trucks,

4010
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:28,201
which they do.

4011
01:38:28,201 --> 01:38:29,490
There's a couple of trophy truck teams,

4012
01:38:29,491 --> 01:38:31,460
but they'll race Volkswagen's,

4013
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:33,390
they'll race everything
you could possibly get.

4014
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:34,950
So you were talking about the French guy,

4015
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:36,060
they wanted to kick your ass.

4016
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:38,930
Is that a guy from France that
came over just to race in this?

4017
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:39,150
Yeah,

4018
01:38:39,150 --> 01:38:39,630
there's about,

4019
01:38:39,630 --> 01:38:42,030
there's usually guys from 150 countries.

4020
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:43,320
People from all over the world come.

4021
01:38:43,321 --> 01:38:44,490
Japanese guys come down there.

4022
01:38:44,491 --> 01:38:46,770
All that means is everybody all
over the world come to Baja.

4023
01:38:46,771 --> 01:38:47,280
1000.

4024
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,690
It's that much of a spectacle.

4025
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,281
You,

4026
01:38:49,281 --> 01:38:50,220
you have to be,

4027
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:52,200
I don't live in a cave for 800 years,

4028
01:38:52,201 --> 01:38:53,670
not to hear the ball went thousand.

4029
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:54,600
Wow.

4030
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:55,920
And then people from
all over the world come.

4031
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:56,251
Yeah.

4032
01:38:56,251 --> 01:38:58,710
Because I've seen like in Europe,

4033
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:03,510
I know they do a lot of rally car races
and they use Porsha's like Porsche has a

4034
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:04,470
lot of rally cars.

4035
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,870
They drive on dirt roads.

4036
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:07,470
Yeah.

4037
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:10,380
But did they have this
kind of thing as well?

4038
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:12,680
And other countries?

4039
01:39:12,810 --> 01:39:13,140
Yeah.

4040
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,340
No rallies pig everywhere.

4041
01:39:14,370 --> 01:39:18,270
Like this kind of rally like this
kinda like crazy modified truck.

4042
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:20,070
A Dad Day to dat car,

4043
01:39:20,071 --> 01:39:20,720
which is a little,

4044
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,320
a little bit different
races as a stage race.

4045
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:23,660
That car used to was um,

4046
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:24,940
really from Paris did a car,

4047
01:39:24,941 --> 01:39:26,490
it was Perry to car was the name of it.

4048
01:39:26,491 --> 01:39:29,340
And now that's in South America
through Brazil and Argentina and Chile.

4049
01:39:29,610 --> 01:39:30,480
Have you raced that car yet?

4050
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:31,050
No.

4051
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:31,261
Yeah,

4052
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:32,160
there's no cars.

4053
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,570
Famous race.

4054
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:38,090
I mean it's a very famous race and we
score Raj and I've been talking to Saudis

4055
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,300
to try to bring your race over there.

4056
01:39:39,301 --> 01:39:40,350
We've met with China.

4057
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:42,570
Roger met with China to try
to bring in race over there.

4058
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:43,321
Um,

4059
01:39:43,321 --> 01:39:46,530
we were going to try to expand what score
is going to do and try to bring it to

4060
01:39:46,531 --> 01:39:47,070
other countries.

4061
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:50,700
I would think it would be a no brainer
for like Saudi Arabia or any of those

4062
01:39:50,701 --> 01:39:55,500
places where I was rich oil people
love to do crazy shit like drift cars.

4063
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:55,800
Yup.

4064
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,010
Like you've seen those videos.

4065
01:39:57,011 --> 01:39:58,170
So it's drifting videos.

4066
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:58,770
Oh yeah.

4067
01:39:58,770 --> 01:40:00,300
From Arab countries.

4068
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:02,570
Dubai's real big right
now on the sand buggies.

4069
01:40:02,610 --> 01:40:05,940
You need to get them into off road at
will Rogers talking to me and we can get,

4070
01:40:05,941 --> 01:40:06,900
we can get him over there.

4071
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:08,070
They have an f one race,

4072
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:08,860
you know the,

4073
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:09,230
yeah.

4074
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,470
Obviously idea is getting all,

4075
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:10,740
you know,

4076
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:12,600
get all the trophy truck
teams come over there.

4077
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:14,730
But I'm on a ship getting
everybody there and go race.

4078
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:14,880
Yeah.

4079
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,680
What's the sand buggies like?

4080
01:40:16,681 --> 01:40:17,514
Uh,

4081
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:22,200
it's a lot lighter buggy than what we
raced in off road and they basically just

4082
01:40:22,201 --> 01:40:22,980
go to the sand dunes there.

4083
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:26,970
Specific built for sand dunes and
they have thousand horsepower.

4084
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:28,320
They do wheelies up the hill,

4085
01:40:28,321 --> 01:40:29,930
down the hill and over in Dubai.

4086
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:31,470
I guess that's a big
thing going on right now.

4087
01:40:31,471 --> 01:40:32,430
A lot of the recreational,

4088
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:33,441
not racist,

4089
01:40:33,441 --> 01:40:34,130
just recreation.

4090
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:34,963
Just having fun.

4091
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:38,550
What is it about people that,

4092
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,330
you know,

4093
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:41,760
like the moment someone invented cars,

4094
01:40:41,761 --> 01:40:42,070
look at it.

4095
01:40:42,070 --> 01:40:43,440
These guys are drifting.

4096
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:45,960
Why is that exciting to go sideways,

4097
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:46,883
by the way?

4098
01:40:47,100 --> 01:40:47,933
I have no idea.

4099
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,210
The feeling of being out of control
because guiding the most people.

4100
01:40:51,211 --> 01:40:52,170
I haven't had a control.

4101
01:40:52,780 --> 01:40:54,310
That's an open freeway almost.

4102
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:57,880
Yeah know it looks like it is it
that doesn't seem like a smart move.

4103
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:58,331
Well,

4104
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:00,850
I've seen some fucking
horrific crashes to oh yeah.

4105
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:01,730
I've seen some of those uh,

4106
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:06,370
Arab drifting crashes or cars or
flipping and bodies are flying out.

4107
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:10,810
But the moment like people invented cars,

4108
01:41:10,930 --> 01:41:14,950
like how long before the moment of car
was invented before people decided to

4109
01:41:14,951 --> 01:41:16,780
fucking race him when
the second car was built,

4110
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:17,740
probably right.

4111
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:18,370
I'll promise you.

4112
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:19,330
When the second car was built,

4113
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:22,810
Henry Ford based the whole
industry that our whole industry,

4114
01:41:22,811 --> 01:41:24,670
the first auto race was in in Chicago,

4115
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:26,440
but our whole industry
is based on auto racing.

4116
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:27,010
It's,

4117
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:28,300
it's theirs.

4118
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:32,530
It's even goes past the 60s it's back
when Henry Ford that he raced Henry Ford

4119
01:41:32,531 --> 01:41:35,320
raised Duesenberg raced all these guys,

4120
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:35,661
raced it,

4121
01:41:35,661 --> 01:41:37,630
prove out Edelbrock
who's a aftermarket guy,

4122
01:41:37,631 --> 01:41:38,321
but he raised,

4123
01:41:38,321 --> 01:41:38,980
they all,

4124
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:40,450
the thing in our industry is,

4125
01:41:40,451 --> 01:41:40,721
you know,

4126
01:41:40,721 --> 01:41:41,471
race on Sunday,

4127
01:41:41,471 --> 01:41:42,340
sell on Monday,

4128
01:41:42,341 --> 01:41:43,360
so I'm going to go out.

4129
01:41:43,361 --> 01:41:45,880
Ford built his cars like I'm
going to go out and win this race.

4130
01:41:45,881 --> 01:41:48,850
Indianapolis 500 was based
on manufacturers racing.

4131
01:41:48,851 --> 01:41:50,140
Who's got the fastest car?

4132
01:41:50,350 --> 01:41:52,630
I had a conversation with
someone about that once,

4133
01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,180
whether we're talking
about planned obsolescence,

4134
01:41:55,181 --> 01:41:56,980
like planned like that.

4135
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,730
There's certain technology
that's available today that
you're not going to see

4136
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:04,480
in cell phones or televisions because
they want it to be obsolete a year from

4137
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:04,720
now.

4138
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:08,060
And he was trying to make the argument
about automobiles that they do that,

4139
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:09,070
that they can make the best car.

4140
01:42:09,071 --> 01:42:09,221
Right?

4141
01:42:09,221 --> 01:42:09,551
And I'm like,

4142
01:42:09,551 --> 01:42:09,751
you're,

4143
01:42:09,751 --> 01:42:11,290
you don't even know what the
fuck you're talking about.

4144
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:14,710
Because what they're doing right now
is they're racing cars and then they

4145
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:17,380
developed that technology
based on those race cars.

4146
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:22,360
And that trickles down into the consumer
aftermarket cars or consumer cars.

4147
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:24,710
The corvette program is
the number one to look at,

4148
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:24,870
right?

4149
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:25,870
So corvette is the longest,

4150
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:27,490
longest running sports car in America,

4151
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:32,500
long as bill isn't everyone out of
production and their race program that the

4152
01:42:32,501 --> 01:42:33,730
transfer of technology,

4153
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:38,050
I did a whole documentary series on
corvette launching the c six and the whole

4154
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:39,640
thing was transfer technology.

4155
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:40,690
If they develop a,

4156
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:41,231
you know,

4157
01:42:41,231 --> 01:42:42,370
you do the R and d,

4158
01:42:42,371 --> 01:42:43,360
which is the hard part,

4159
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:43,810
right?

4160
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:47,080
Which is what rob does for his trucks
and they start looking and poking around.

4161
01:42:47,081 --> 01:42:50,080
You do in the Rd and your race and
you make that c six corvette are,

4162
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:53,800
which is called [inaudible] that are
now [inaudible] sweet corvette or they

4163
01:42:53,801 --> 01:42:54,550
raced those teens.

4164
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:57,210
Pratt and Miller builds
them and then there is it.

4165
01:42:57,211 --> 01:43:01,630
There is a Chevrolet engineer and I know
them on the race team looking at stuff.

4166
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:02,970
Do you know checking Cambra,

4167
01:43:02,980 --> 01:43:03,750
checking brakes,

4168
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:05,170
checking aerodynamics,

4169
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:08,530
checking everything and that
technology transfers to your car,

4170
01:43:08,531 --> 01:43:12,760
which is why corvette is still one of
the most dominant cars out there for 70

4171
01:43:12,761 --> 01:43:13,151
grand.

4172
01:43:13,151 --> 01:43:14,520
You can get it just because they,

4173
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:18,580
they invest in that technology and the
new one is incredible and stingers pretty

4174
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:20,200
bad is an incredible car.

4175
01:43:20,201 --> 01:43:21,220
It's beautiful looking.

4176
01:43:21,221 --> 01:43:22,060
I saw one the other day,

4177
01:43:22,061 --> 01:43:23,050
I thought it was a Ferrari.

4178
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:23,740
Same here.

4179
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:24,481
I told my son,

4180
01:43:24,481 --> 01:43:24,780
I go,

4181
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:26,590
she got that Ferrari
because that's a corvette.

4182
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:28,541
You're right.

4183
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:28,840
Sorry.

4184
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:29,680
It looks like,

4185
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:30,521
yeah,

4186
01:43:30,521 --> 01:43:35,521
it looks like like a European like high
end top end car and the Interior's nice

4187
01:43:36,191 --> 01:43:39,580
now to finally they figured out a way
to make a car that doesn't look like a

4188
01:43:39,581 --> 01:43:41,980
piece of shit with a fucking
impala steering wheel.

4189
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:45,070
I mean they used to have
these dog shit interiors.

4190
01:43:45,130 --> 01:43:45,581
Same thing.

4191
01:43:45,581 --> 01:43:46,210
The Viper did we,

4192
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:49,720
I did document and reasonably
I'm rebuilding the Viper
Ralph Shields from uh,

4193
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,680
from SRT motors.

4194
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:51,514
He did the same thing.

4195
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:53,870
They race,

4196
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:54,950
they learned stuff from racing.

4197
01:43:54,951 --> 01:43:55,611
They put it in there.

4198
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:57,530
But the new new viper is amazing looking.

4199
01:43:57,780 --> 01:43:58,171
What's,

4200
01:43:58,171 --> 01:43:58,981
what's a better car?

4201
01:43:58,981 --> 01:44:00,360
The New Viper or the new corvette?

4202
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:01,741
Depends.

4203
01:44:01,741 --> 01:44:03,240
The price points are much
different for the money.

4204
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:06,120
The core of that has to be at the
price point on the viper is 110,000,

4205
01:44:06,121 --> 01:44:08,130
115,000 to the core of it.

4206
01:44:08,131 --> 01:44:09,300
You could take the roof off too.

4207
01:44:09,301 --> 01:44:10,150
That's pretty dope.

4208
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:11,070
The core of that's pretty cool.

4209
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:11,191
Yeah.

4210
01:44:11,191 --> 01:44:12,024
Look at that thing.

4211
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:14,280
I mean they fucking nailed it man.

4212
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:14,791
Yeah.

4213
01:44:14,791 --> 01:44:15,420
But see all the,

4214
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:16,350
all the hood vents,

4215
01:44:16,351 --> 01:44:16,741
all the,

4216
01:44:16,741 --> 01:44:17,730
all the break ducks,

4217
01:44:17,731 --> 01:44:19,560
all that stuff is all
developed from racing.

4218
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:20,490
It's all functional.

4219
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:21,090
Yeah.

4220
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:22,050
It's not nonsense.

4221
01:44:22,051 --> 01:44:23,370
It's not just something to look at,

4222
01:44:23,610 --> 01:44:23,911
which,

4223
01:44:23,911 --> 01:44:24,240
uh,

4224
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:24,720
you know,

4225
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:26,190
cars have had in the past.

4226
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:31,520
We were at a weird time right now in
automobiles because there's so much power.

4227
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:32,873
Great time.

4228
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:33,713
Great time,

4229
01:44:33,930 --> 01:44:38,550
but so much power in the cars you
could buy on the showroom floor,

4230
01:44:38,551 --> 01:44:40,080
like when they have a,

4231
01:44:40,081 --> 01:44:45,081
the the Shelby gt 500 660 plus horsepower.

4232
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:45,960
Yep.

4233
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:49,230
Right at the walk from the showroom,

4234
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:54,710
pay the guy your money getting a car and
you have a 660 plus horsepower car with

4235
01:44:55,231 --> 01:45:00,231
a live rear axle and you're stomping
on the high of Bois and it goes,

4236
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:04,440
it's the same zero to 60 in three seconds
in a fucking car that you could just

4237
01:45:04,441 --> 01:45:05,790
drive off the showroom floor.

4238
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:06,920
And in the 60s he used to be,

4239
01:45:06,921 --> 01:45:07,130
you know,

4240
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:08,270
280 horsepower,

4241
01:45:08,271 --> 01:45:10,620
332 the boss came out as like go,

4242
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,080
it's got 320 horsepower.

4243
01:45:14,080 --> 01:45:14,480
And I've,

4244
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:18,200
I've actually driven an old 302 and I
actually test drove the new three Oh two

4245
01:45:18,201 --> 01:45:19,540
and a test track at Ford.

4246
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:20,930
It's unbelievable.

4247
01:45:21,140 --> 01:45:22,370
Parnelli Jones said the same thing.

4248
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:25,010
It's like if we are racing at Laguna
Saker Parnelli and I was like,

4249
01:45:25,011 --> 01:45:26,900
if I had that car it'd be easy.

4250
01:45:27,900 --> 01:45:28,051
Well,

4251
01:45:28,051 --> 01:45:31,590
the new m three Oh two are you talking
about the Laguna Saker one or the one

4252
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:32,421
that hasn't come out yet?

4253
01:45:32,421 --> 01:45:32,510
Yeah,

4254
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:32,761
we are.

4255
01:45:32,761 --> 01:45:35,370
We are [inaudible] and I were
test driving the Laguna Seca.

4256
01:45:35,910 --> 01:45:37,350
That's an incredible car.

4257
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:40,350
If the car got overlooked a lot by people,

4258
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,120
it did cause first of all,

4259
01:45:42,121 --> 01:45:43,170
the stripes and everything.

4260
01:45:43,171 --> 01:45:45,300
We're a little whack like the
way they were painting it,

4261
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:47,670
but everybody wants the bigger engine.

4262
01:45:47,671 --> 01:45:48,690
Everybody wants the,

4263
01:45:48,691 --> 01:45:48,931
you know,

4264
01:45:48,931 --> 01:45:50,690
the 550 horsepower shell,

4265
01:45:50,691 --> 01:45:53,190
but now the 668 horsepower Shelby,

4266
01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:55,680
but that 440 horsepower,

4267
01:45:55,681 --> 01:45:59,040
Laguna Seca was the perfect
balance front end to rear end.

4268
01:45:59,041 --> 01:45:59,874
There it is right there.

4269
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:00,400
Yeah,

4270
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,233
it was suspension.

4271
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:02,940
That's the boss three o two right?

4272
01:46:03,010 --> 01:46:03,191
Yeah.

4273
01:46:03,191 --> 01:46:04,420
That's the boss to go to.

4274
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:05,770
Yup.

4275
01:46:05,770 --> 01:46:06,710
That's the boss or at two.

4276
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,680
And then you're talking about the goodness
sake of with the red and he had the

4277
01:46:08,681 --> 01:46:09,180
red lips,

4278
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:10,013
red rims,

4279
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:11,780
the front error.

4280
01:46:11,781 --> 01:46:13,310
I'm the front spoiler.

4281
01:46:13,311 --> 01:46:15,830
The race spoiler with the
pipes coming off of it,

4282
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:21,130
they just figured out a way to
make cars that have horsepower.

4283
01:46:21,981 --> 01:46:25,400
That would be a fucking super exotic car.

4284
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:26,810
Just 20 years ago,

4285
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,340
just 20 years ago,

4286
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:32,600
if you wanted to buy a car
that had 400 horsepower,

4287
01:46:32,780 --> 01:46:34,700
I mean you're spending a hundred grand,

4288
01:46:34,910 --> 01:46:36,770
you're spending 150 grand,

4289
01:46:36,771 --> 01:46:36,921
you know,

4290
01:46:36,921 --> 01:46:37,754
you're buying,

4291
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:38,301
you know,

4292
01:46:38,301 --> 01:46:42,500
the top of the line Porsche nine 11
turbo or something like that or crazy

4293
01:46:42,501 --> 01:46:43,230
Lamborghini.

4294
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:43,420
Yeah,

4295
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:44,420
that's 300 grand.

4296
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:46,430
Now you're buying a fucking Mustang gt.

4297
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:47,060
Yep.

4298
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:49,740
I mean it's bizarre with bizarre time.

4299
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:49,980
It's

4300
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:50,460
good,

4301
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:51,450
it's very good.

4302
01:46:51,451 --> 01:46:55,680
But the amount of power and responsibility
that comes with having one of these,

4303
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:58,050
he just handed off to some
fucking 17 year old kid.

4304
01:46:58,370 --> 01:46:59,040
Merry,

4305
01:46:59,040 --> 01:46:59,731
merry Christmas.

4306
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:00,564
You little fuck.

4307
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:01,493
Here's your key.

4308
01:47:02,040 --> 01:47:03,030
Well they've also improved.

4309
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:03,770
They've also improved.

4310
01:47:03,770 --> 01:47:04,260
Um,

4311
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:04,870
breaks,

4312
01:47:04,870 --> 01:47:05,490
breaks,

4313
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:06,360
trash control.

4314
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:06,881
Actually I,

4315
01:47:06,881 --> 01:47:07,800
I have also,

4316
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:09,120
I have big issues with tracks,

4317
01:47:09,121 --> 01:47:09,471
controls,

4318
01:47:09,471 --> 01:47:09,901
stuff like that.

4319
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:13,170
Cause you do hand that guy 700
horsepower car and then he really,

4320
01:47:13,171 --> 01:47:14,000
then you just,

4321
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,200
you really unfuck everything for him.

4322
01:47:16,201 --> 01:47:16,441
Right.

4323
01:47:16,441 --> 01:47:17,430
If he gets a little squirrely,

4324
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:22,040
the car fixes it for the car facility
management and just actually breaking for

4325
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:22,261
you.

4326
01:47:22,261 --> 01:47:22,920
You don't,

4327
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,210
you don't have throttle cables anymore.

4328
01:47:24,211 --> 01:47:26,940
He got drive by wire and you
can hit wide open throttle,

4329
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:27,990
but the drive by wire,

4330
01:47:27,991 --> 01:47:29,060
the brain tells you no,

4331
01:47:29,061 --> 01:47:29,161
no,

4332
01:47:29,161 --> 01:47:29,310
no.

4333
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:31,920
You don't want full throttle cause
you're just going to spin the tires.

4334
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:34,560
I was racing at road
Atlanta in a corvette,

4335
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:37,560
c six corvette and they have this
turn 11 that comes off in your car,

4336
01:47:37,561 --> 01:47:38,311
gets airborne,

4337
01:47:38,311 --> 01:47:40,120
and every time I get airborne
I had to land the card,

4338
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:41,130
shut off like,

4339
01:47:41,131 --> 01:47:41,970
okay idiot,

4340
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:42,900
whatever you're doing,

4341
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,150
you've got to stop
because that's not good.

4342
01:47:45,151 --> 01:47:46,230
We're not supposed to have four.

4343
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,400
It would shut off.

4344
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:48,690
It would go into limp mode.

4345
01:47:48,691 --> 01:47:49,330
Shut off I go,

4346
01:47:49,330 --> 01:47:50,280
bird,

4347
01:47:50,300 --> 01:47:53,970
go around the what if you had to
fucking maneuver away from something?

4348
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:54,630
Well,

4349
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:55,800
the Angie would go into limp mode.

4350
01:47:55,801 --> 01:47:56,140
It wouldn't.

4351
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:56,371
It would.

4352
01:47:56,371 --> 01:47:56,820
It would go.

4353
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:57,660
It would shut down.

4354
01:47:57,661 --> 01:47:58,401
I'd nailed the throttle.

4355
01:47:58,401 --> 01:47:59,161
There's no throttle.

4356
01:47:59,161 --> 01:47:59,701
It would go,

4357
01:47:59,701 --> 01:48:01,020
it would go into four cylinder mode,

4358
01:48:01,021 --> 01:48:01,501
limp mode,

4359
01:48:01,501 --> 01:48:04,680
until I got halfway through the strait
and we're going to go and I couldn't shut

4360
01:48:04,681 --> 01:48:05,514
the damn thing off.

4361
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:07,050
That's retarded.

4362
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:07,500
Yeah,

4363
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,430
that's terrible.

4364
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:09,091
But now they're,

4365
01:48:09,091 --> 01:48:12,840
they're developing them with sport mode
and other modes where you can do it.

4366
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:15,210
You can flip a switch to you
on a lot of these so you can,

4367
01:48:15,690 --> 01:48:17,040
well the other problem is,

4368
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:19,050
I don't know if this is true,

4369
01:48:19,051 --> 01:48:23,490
but what people are really worried about
is that someone is going to be able to

4370
01:48:23,491 --> 01:48:25,830
have kill switches when
they get shut your car off.

4371
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:27,030
Like remotely.

4372
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:29,460
Like say if you're running from
the cops or something like that.

4373
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:30,420
They're doing already.

4374
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:31,560
They have Onstar,

4375
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,180
Onstar does that,

4376
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:33,521
you know,

4377
01:48:33,521 --> 01:48:33,870
Onstar,

4378
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:34,920
you can shut your car off like that.

4379
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:38,100
Like Joe Rogan just told my Cadillac
and even driving down the road,

4380
01:48:38,101 --> 01:48:40,380
can you please shut it off being really?

4381
01:48:41,070 --> 01:48:41,520
Yup.

4382
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,780
Can you pull that shit out?

4383
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:44,220
It can you unplug all that stuff?

4384
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:45,130
Probably.

4385
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:46,110
That's probably wired in.

4386
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,790
It's definitely wired in,

4387
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:50,910
but that's something
you can't retroactively,

4388
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:56,030
you can't take like an old corvette
sting ray like a 1970 sting ray and just

4389
01:48:56,221 --> 01:49:01,221
take all those modern components and
have the same sort of experience that you

4390
01:49:01,351 --> 01:49:03,360
would have drive and a c seven corvette,

4391
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:05,460
but no Onstar,

4392
01:49:06,270 --> 01:49:07,140
no nonsense.

4393
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:07,740
I'm sure you could,

4394
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:08,161
can you,

4395
01:49:08,161 --> 01:49:09,630
but you couldn't have
the traction control,

4396
01:49:09,631 --> 01:49:10,350
right?

4397
01:49:10,350 --> 01:49:10,801
You couldn't,

4398
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:11,730
could you figure that out?

4399
01:49:11,731 --> 01:49:13,680
A way to put a computer and have all that,

4400
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:14,281
there's enough,

4401
01:49:14,281 --> 01:49:14,760
there's enough,

4402
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:15,070
you know,

4403
01:49:15,070 --> 01:49:17,370
tuners are tutored and
builders are amazing.

4404
01:49:17,371 --> 01:49:18,570
They can have the traction control on it.

4405
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:19,080
Sure.

4406
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:20,580
Cause that's what a lot
of people want to do now.

4407
01:49:20,581 --> 01:49:21,090
Right?

4408
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:22,260
I mean that's another
show that you're doing,

4409
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:22,630
right?

4410
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:23,730
The restaurant mods,

4411
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,550
rest of Mod,

4412
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:28,410
rest of mods or the thing where you
take an old car and you put all new

4413
01:49:28,620 --> 01:49:29,341
suspension,

4414
01:49:29,341 --> 01:49:30,450
new components,

4415
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:31,890
that's very attractive to people.

4416
01:49:31,980 --> 01:49:32,640
Tim Allen's going to,

4417
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:36,390
he's got a [inaudible] 69 Camaro and
it's got all new c seven corvette,

4418
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:36,750
um,

4419
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,460
suspension wheels,

4420
01:49:38,461 --> 01:49:39,031
everything in it,

4421
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:39,421
assemble it.

4422
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:40,061
You can look it up.

4423
01:49:40,061 --> 01:49:40,861
It's his new,

4424
01:49:40,861 --> 01:49:41,611
it's green.

4425
01:49:41,611 --> 01:49:42,241
It's beautiful.

4426
01:49:42,241 --> 01:49:43,021
You pop the hood,

4427
01:49:43,021 --> 01:49:43,161
you know,

4428
01:49:43,161 --> 01:49:44,190
like some stuff are you into cars.

4429
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:44,911
You and I were looking at it.

4430
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:46,140
It's unbelievable.

4431
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:47,350
And he drives it around.

4432
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:47,531
Yeah.

4433
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:48,550
If you could drive it everywhere.

4434
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:48,850
Yeah.

4435
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:49,510
Drive it away.

4436
01:49:49,510 --> 01:49:50,410
It starts like a corvette.

4437
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:52,360
You can start it from the [inaudible] six,

4438
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:52,580
nine.

4439
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:53,470
Camille just start it up.

4440
01:49:53,650 --> 01:49:54,483
It's a cool car.

4441
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:55,990
What about the interior?

4442
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:59,530
Does it look like a new corvette or is
it like an old school interior as well?

4443
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:00,370
Old School Interior.

4444
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:01,061
Wow.

4445
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:01,661
Pull that up,

4446
01:50:01,661 --> 01:50:01,961
man.

4447
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:02,830
Lemme see this?

4448
01:50:03,020 --> 01:50:03,170
Yeah.

4449
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:04,840
It's built by Bodie Straub built it.

4450
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:05,351
Okay.

4451
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:06,190
I've heard that name before,

4452
01:50:06,191 --> 01:50:06,470
right?

4453
01:50:06,470 --> 01:50:06,920
Yes.

4454
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:07,190
Yep.

4455
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:07,930
I've told you about it.

4456
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:08,763
Yeah.

4457
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:09,940
This is a video of it.

4458
01:50:09,941 --> 01:50:10,460
Here is,

4459
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:11,293
that's it?

4460
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:12,370
Yup.

4461
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:13,770
Tim Allen and Jay Leno.

4462
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:14,613
Hey.

4463
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:15,483
Wow.

4464
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:17,350
Jay Leno's garage.

4465
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:19,271
Oh Wow.

4466
01:50:19,271 --> 01:50:19,571
I mean,

4467
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:20,890
it really is a sleeper.

4468
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:21,753
Yeah,

4469
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:22,990
that's crazy.

4470
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:23,650
That's a corvette.

4471
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:24,431
Turn the volume of,

4472
01:50:24,431 --> 01:50:26,080
let me hear what he
says to say about this.

4473
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,850
This one here belongs to a real car guy.

4474
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:29,931
Tim Allen.

4475
01:50:29,931 --> 01:50:30,141
Tim,

4476
01:50:30,141 --> 01:50:30,561
come on in,

4477
01:50:30,561 --> 01:50:30,950
buddy.

4478
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:31,790
Shitty wheels,

4479
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:33,700
but introduction,

4480
01:50:33,701 --> 01:50:34,880
I stock sucks.

4481
01:50:36,290 --> 01:50:36,891
Comedian,

4482
01:50:36,891 --> 01:50:37,271
actor,

4483
01:50:37,271 --> 01:50:39,800
a bestselling author and cargo car guy.

4484
01:50:39,890 --> 01:50:40,161
Yeah,

4485
01:50:40,161 --> 01:50:41,090
movie star,

4486
01:50:41,660 --> 01:50:42,830
but most of all cargo.

4487
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:44,330
This is a beautiful Camaro.

4488
01:50:44,331 --> 01:50:44,601
You know,

4489
01:50:44,601 --> 01:50:47,150
I'd been looking at it when
it first pulled anyone,

4490
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:47,341
oh,

4491
01:50:47,341 --> 01:50:48,111
it's 68 Camaro,

4492
01:50:48,111 --> 01:50:51,320
but then I look and there's all
these subtle little changes.

4493
01:50:51,321 --> 01:50:52,770
Just the kinds of things that I like.

4494
01:50:53,250 --> 01:50:56,290
The stock wheels are way wider rims.

4495
01:50:58,240 --> 01:50:58,460
Tom?

4496
01:50:58,460 --> 01:50:58,671
Sure.

4497
01:50:58,671 --> 01:51:01,130
We'd used to race one of these
on Woodward when I was a kid.

4498
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:02,091
Green.

4499
01:51:02,091 --> 01:51:05,600
This car stock three 27th it's one of
those things that was just a great bullet.

4500
01:51:05,601 --> 01:51:06,060
It ran.

4501
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:08,180
It ran circles around any other car.

4502
01:51:08,181 --> 01:51:09,080
I loved that car.

4503
01:51:09,081 --> 01:51:09,914
Loved race with them.

4504
01:51:10,010 --> 01:51:10,910
No console.

4505
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:12,800
It was the low end one,

4506
01:51:12,801 --> 01:51:13,760
wasn't the SS,

4507
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:19,070
so I redid that and always like smokey
Yunick the Trans am car that he made and

4508
01:51:19,071 --> 01:51:20,030
every time I saw one,

4509
01:51:20,031 --> 01:51:24,560
I think one of the elder Brock family
has it now and I'd see it race in these

4510
01:51:24,650 --> 01:51:25,670
classic car racing.

4511
01:51:25,740 --> 01:51:25,980
Wait,

4512
01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:27,500
there's something about that car.

4513
01:51:28,010 --> 01:51:29,940
Not the fact that he's trans and lower.

4514
01:51:30,470 --> 01:51:33,920
He showed two inches off
the rake up the hood,

4515
01:51:34,370 --> 01:51:35,510
took off the drip rails,

4516
01:51:35,511 --> 01:51:38,390
which I don't have on
their natural flares,

4517
01:51:38,391 --> 01:51:38,991
which they don't have.

4518
01:51:38,991 --> 01:51:40,010
They're not all buttoned up.

4519
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:42,930
A lot of my time with the ball pin
hammer j you know what I may think,

4520
01:51:42,931 --> 01:51:43,171
think,

4521
01:51:43,171 --> 01:51:48,171
think and then I decided in those days
and Woodward days they had Coppos,

4522
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:52,550
which is what is your central
office production order?

4523
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:55,820
You could put it on your order
and if you did the right sequence,

4524
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:58,030
GM would put a truck motor into cars.

4525
01:51:58,040 --> 01:52:02,740
We did that time was a four 27 and they
put four 2017 and very few Camaro's and

4526
01:52:02,741 --> 01:52:03,130
other wood,

4527
01:52:03,130 --> 01:52:03,470
you know,

4528
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:04,540
800 grand or something.

4529
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:09,600
But what that means is that GM did not
want their big engine from the corvette

4530
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:13,590
and the Camaro to fall

4531
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,930
from the cell production.

4532
01:52:18,170 --> 01:52:19,003
You could,

4533
01:52:20,990 --> 01:52:24,530
you could special order a car with
the big engine and that's what these,

4534
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:25,940
and so I changed the name to that.

4535
01:52:25,941 --> 01:52:29,150
That's the name of to four 27 Coppo
that shows what we called it didn't,

4536
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:31,490
we did some great little name tags.

4537
01:52:31,610 --> 01:52:33,680
All this kind of stuff
is details that I like.

4538
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:35,900
Rally wheels that aren't
wheels at all there.

4539
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:37,700
I mean it's not a wheel like the old days,

4540
01:52:37,701 --> 01:52:39,330
he's disc brakes have to fit underneath.

4541
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:40,330
You've got to make them bigger.

4542
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,100
And I mean that's what I like.

4543
01:52:43,101 --> 01:52:43,690
You know,

4544
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:46,400
I like it when someone does a period car.

4545
01:52:46,580 --> 01:52:47,211
I hate it when they,

4546
01:52:47,211 --> 01:52:49,040
all of a sudden they
have 22 inch dubs on it.

4547
01:52:49,041 --> 01:52:49,490
And it's right.

4548
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:50,360
It just doesn't look right.

4549
01:52:50,370 --> 01:52:51,141
You know this town,

4550
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:53,240
you hit a pothole and I'm
standing at the side of the road.

4551
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:54,410
I got to have a cause.

4552
01:52:54,411 --> 01:52:56,630
I drive these things right and well,

4553
01:52:56,631 --> 01:52:57,560
that's a beautiful looking.

4554
01:52:57,561 --> 01:52:57,831
We all,

4555
01:52:57,831 --> 01:52:59,930
I mean that's a custom
wheel you cannot buy.

4556
01:52:59,931 --> 01:53:01,790
That was made specifically
for this vehicle.

4557
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:02,211
Number one,

4558
01:53:02,211 --> 01:53:04,160
I really wanted black wheels with hubcaps.

4559
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:05,370
That's how coppos came.

4560
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:06,980
They didn't come with rally wheels.

4561
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:08,900
So I have a set of black wheels.

4562
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:09,741
I want bumpers.

4563
01:53:09,741 --> 01:53:13,670
I put back on it all the trim went back
and I stock mirrors right back on it.

4564
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:14,391
No console,

4565
01:53:14,391 --> 01:53:15,170
none of that stuff.

4566
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:15,261
Well,

4567
01:53:15,261 --> 01:53:16,070
that's what I love.

4568
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:17,480
It's really a beautiful,

4569
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:18,110
beautiful.

4570
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:18,381
All right.

4571
01:53:18,381 --> 01:53:20,570
See if you can get a
video of the inside of it.

4572
01:53:20,571 --> 01:53:23,420
I want to see what they did to the
inside of it and she get images,

4573
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:24,441
but that's a,

4574
01:53:24,441 --> 01:53:27,890
that's a trend that a lot of people are
doing now because they want to have that

4575
01:53:27,891 --> 01:53:30,740
beautiful old school muscle car and look,

4576
01:53:31,010 --> 01:53:34,970
but they also want to have a
car that that's the interior.

4577
01:53:35,330 --> 01:53:36,163
No Way.

4578
01:53:36,410 --> 01:53:37,760
That's a real interior.

4579
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:39,310
That's it.

4580
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:42,170
Recaro seats is the only thing
is to be the interior of the car

4581
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:44,730
play.

4582
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:45,440
Press play.

4583
01:53:45,440 --> 01:53:46,370
Let me hear what he has to say.

4584
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:48,703
Low back.

4585
01:53:49,490 --> 01:53:51,140
That can be the actual interior,

4586
01:53:51,170 --> 01:53:52,160
like a stunt interior

4587
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:53,560
air freshener today.

4588
01:53:53,790 --> 01:53:55,180
I was like the brake pedal citizens.

4589
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:55,960
Yes,

4590
01:53:55,960 --> 01:53:58,020
cause that's an image
instead of the video.

4591
01:53:58,021 --> 01:54:00,150
Why isn't why they did it,

4592
01:54:00,780 --> 01:54:01,613
but that does interior.

4593
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:02,610
I've sat in their car.

4594
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:04,160
That's what it looks like he had.

4595
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:06,570
He put like an old stupid looking
steering wheel and everything.

4596
01:54:06,571 --> 01:54:07,620
It's a stock steering wheel.

4597
01:54:07,621 --> 01:54:08,820
Everything stock interior,

4598
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,990
but it's not stock handling like
the pinion and all that shit.

4599
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:13,381
Yeah,

4600
01:54:13,381 --> 01:54:13,711
it's all,

4601
01:54:13,711 --> 01:54:15,270
it's all c c seven corvette.

4602
01:54:15,690 --> 01:54:16,523
Wow.

4603
01:54:16,770 --> 01:54:17,670
That's the trend,

4604
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:18,210
right?

4605
01:54:18,210 --> 01:54:19,110
That's what everybody wants.

4606
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:20,490
And your new show.

4607
01:54:20,491 --> 01:54:21,030
When is that?

4608
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:22,170
Is that an airing already?

4609
01:54:22,230 --> 01:54:23,790
Pilot on history channel hasn't aired yet.

4610
01:54:24,210 --> 01:54:24,751
There'll be a pilot.

4611
01:54:24,751 --> 01:54:25,800
We were shooting the pilot right now.

4612
01:54:26,150 --> 01:54:28,350
We'll start doing a bunch of
different cars like that dude,

4613
01:54:28,351 --> 01:54:28,771
four of them.

4614
01:54:28,771 --> 01:54:29,160
Yeah.

4615
01:54:29,160 --> 01:54:31,680
Now how much would Tim Allen have to
spend to make something like that?

4616
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:32,641
Three,

4617
01:54:32,641 --> 01:54:33,720
400,000 days.

4618
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:35,010
It's fucking Christ.

4619
01:54:35,011 --> 01:54:35,301
You get it.

4620
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:37,230
God Damn brand new corvette for 60 grand.

4621
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,610
Talk about defeating the purpose.

4622
01:54:38,611 --> 01:54:39,480
You can get a trophy truck.

4623
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:39,880
Why?

4624
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,670
Why spend money on that when
you could buy a trophy truck?

4625
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:42,930
Well that's what you're into now.

4626
01:54:42,931 --> 01:54:43,530
You'd just,

4627
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:45,840
regular cars on flat ground
is boring as shit to you.

4628
01:54:46,090 --> 01:54:47,010
They are boring as shit.

4629
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:49,320
You have wait way to go
wait to go for a ride.

4630
01:54:49,321 --> 01:54:50,550
Come bring us back.

4631
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:51,413
When you come back.

4632
01:54:51,660 --> 01:54:53,940
I'll bring you back when I
come back and we do Vegas.

4633
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:54,360
Um,

4634
01:54:54,360 --> 01:54:55,560
when can people see your show?

4635
01:54:55,561 --> 01:54:56,281
Because I know you,

4636
01:54:56,281 --> 01:54:57,114
uh,

4637
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:58,740
April 20th on CBS sports.

4638
01:54:58,800 --> 01:54:59,431
April 20th.

4639
01:54:59,431 --> 01:55:00,720
CBS sports on Sunday.

4640
01:55:00,721 --> 01:55:00,871
Yeah.

4641
01:55:00,871 --> 01:55:01,651
It's an hour long.

4642
01:55:01,651 --> 01:55:02,230
We're doing,

4643
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:03,720
we're doing six one hours this year,

4644
01:55:03,721 --> 01:55:04,980
including the Baja 1000.

4645
01:55:04,981 --> 01:55:06,840
So all the races that Rob's racing in,

4646
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:08,460
including the San Philippe to 50 fifties,

4647
01:55:08,461 --> 01:55:11,610
our first race that he raced in,

4648
01:55:11,611 --> 01:55:12,421
we'll tell you what happened,

4649
01:55:12,421 --> 01:55:15,960
but he raced in and it's on April
20th and Chris from overhauling,

4650
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:17,190
he is a,

4651
01:55:17,191 --> 01:55:18,024
is he one of the hosts?

4652
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:20,180
Chris Jacobs from overhauling
though one of our cameras.

4653
01:55:20,181 --> 01:55:20,520
Steele's.

4654
01:55:20,520 --> 01:55:22,320
What is another a compadre of his,

4655
01:55:22,321 --> 01:55:24,810
that he's one of our hosts and
he's a trophy truck racer also.

4656
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:25,380
Awesome.

4657
01:55:25,380 --> 01:55:26,213
Chris Jacobs.

4658
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:27,240
Chris is a cool guy.

4659
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:28,493
Very good dude.

4660
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:30,360
And a crazy car,

4661
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:30,991
not himself.

4662
01:55:30,991 --> 01:55:31,470
There you go.

4663
01:55:31,470 --> 01:55:32,280
There's Chris.

4664
01:55:32,280 --> 01:55:32,760
Yup.

4665
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,480
Wow.

4666
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:34,141
Awesome stuff,

4667
01:55:34,141 --> 01:55:34,530
man.

4668
01:55:34,530 --> 01:55:35,363
Awesome stuff.

4669
01:55:35,370 --> 01:55:35,851
So,

4670
01:55:35,851 --> 01:55:36,540
um,

4671
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:36,900
uh,

4672
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:39,840
do you have a Twitter account
or anything like that?

4673
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:41,131
Yeah,

4674
01:55:41,131 --> 01:55:42,600
Ra at Rob Mac 21.

4675
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:44,310
Rob Back 21?

4676
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:44,640
Yeah.

4677
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:45,001
Okay.

4678
01:55:45,001 --> 01:55:45,401
And Bud,

4679
01:55:45,401 --> 01:55:46,140
do you have a Twitter account?

4680
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:46,490
No.

4681
01:55:46,490 --> 01:55:46,790
No,

4682
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:47,210
no,

4683
01:55:47,210 --> 01:55:47,670
no.

4684
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:48,361
He Says No.

4685
01:55:48,361 --> 01:55:49,290
I wear all black.

4686
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:50,730
I wear all black.

4687
01:55:50,731 --> 01:55:51,930
There'll be no Twitter.

4688
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:52,490
No.

4689
01:55:52,490 --> 01:55:52,670
Right.

4690
01:55:52,670 --> 01:55:53,401
What's a contact?

4691
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:54,950
Me and I have Twitter and Facebook,

4692
01:55:56,270 --> 01:55:58,830
but they will now the French
are fucking mad at you.

4693
01:55:59,430 --> 01:55:59,731
Yeah.

4694
01:55:59,731 --> 01:55:59,971
Yeah.

4695
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:01,410
I've should have kicked her ass.

4696
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:03,900
She didn't that pull over and
now you talk shit about me.

4697
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:06,031
All right.

4698
01:56:06,031 --> 01:56:06,930
April 20th,

4699
01:56:06,950 --> 01:56:07,790
CBS.

4700
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:08,911
Thank you guys.

4701
01:56:08,911 --> 01:56:09,670
This is a lot of fun.

4702
01:56:09,670 --> 01:56:09,860
Yeah,

4703
01:56:09,860 --> 01:56:10,693
great conversation.

4704
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:11,461
And Rob,

4705
01:56:11,461 --> 01:56:12,520
thank you very much for,

4706
01:56:12,521 --> 01:56:12,870
uh,

4707
01:56:12,870 --> 01:56:13,830
explaining us.

4708
01:56:13,831 --> 01:56:14,011
Uh,

4709
01:56:14,011 --> 01:56:14,301
you're,

4710
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:15,270
you're insane world.

4711
01:56:15,370 --> 01:56:15,850
Oh yeah.

4712
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:16,990
We have one more thing for you right now.

4713
01:56:18,820 --> 01:56:19,451
When we raised,

4714
01:56:19,451 --> 01:56:21,250
especially when I started racing every,

4715
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:22,510
if you don't win the race,

4716
01:56:22,511 --> 01:56:23,680
sometimes you get a little bit of money,

4717
01:56:23,681 --> 01:56:24,311
you get a trophy,

4718
01:56:24,311 --> 01:56:24,611
right?

4719
01:56:24,611 --> 01:56:25,990
So we would only race that.

4720
01:56:25,991 --> 01:56:27,520
I have a collection of my house.

4721
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:29,110
You used to get these little pins,

4722
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:29,470
right?

4723
01:56:29,470 --> 01:56:30,280
Little hat pins,

4724
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:31,630
like a $2 hat pin.

4725
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:32,920
This is finisher on it,

4726
01:56:32,921 --> 01:56:33,754
right?

4727
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:34,660
And that's all you raised for.

4728
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:37,810
You just spent all this money
all this time to kill yourself.

4729
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,280
You've got a wall for him.

4730
01:56:39,281 --> 01:56:40,600
I got like 10 right?

4731
01:56:40,810 --> 01:56:42,520
And it says finisher and sometimes I have,

4732
01:56:42,521 --> 01:56:44,380
you know this and I've got
a plaque that says winner,

4733
01:56:44,381 --> 01:56:45,190
but um,

4734
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:46,210
they've upgraded a little bit,

4735
01:56:46,211 --> 01:56:48,040
but generally you run Robin,

4736
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,090
I brought something for you,

4737
01:56:49,150 --> 01:56:53,830
which is going to be a finisher's
medal from the Baja 500 oh,

4738
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:54,340
that's what it looks

4739
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:54,810
like.

4740
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:55,590
You can have it.

4741
01:56:55,590 --> 01:56:55,810
Why?

4742
01:56:55,810 --> 01:56:57,860
Why would I have that Ryan in finish shit,

4743
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,490
I don't deserve to have
this because you get,

4744
01:57:00,520 --> 01:57:01,930
did you get to remember this?

4745
01:57:01,931 --> 01:57:03,110
That's one thing I remember you,

4746
01:57:03,111 --> 01:57:03,621
no matter what,

4747
01:57:03,621 --> 01:57:04,130
Dude,

4748
01:57:04,130 --> 01:57:05,090
you live in my neighborhood.

4749
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:06,350
This is ridiculous.

4750
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,280
I can't have this.

4751
01:57:07,490 --> 01:57:08,121
I'll leave it here,

4752
01:57:08,121 --> 01:57:08,954
but I won't touch it.

4753
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:10,850
Deserve.

4754
01:57:10,850 --> 01:57:11,683
I don't deserve to.

4755
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:12,260
All right.

4756
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:12,741
Good Times,

4757
01:57:12,741 --> 01:57:13,310
gentlemen.

4758
01:57:13,310 --> 01:57:14,270
Rama cat grin.

4759
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:16,950
But Brett's been and a April 20th,

4760
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:18,560
he could watch it on CBS sports.

4761
01:57:18,561 --> 01:57:18,981
Watch it.

4762
01:57:18,981 --> 01:57:19,710
Tune in.

4763
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:20,001
Uh,

4765
01:57:21,140 --> 01:57:23,420
And the history channel
thing is just a pilot.

4766
01:57:23,421 --> 01:57:24,020
Is it airing?

4767
01:57:24,020 --> 01:57:24,231
Yeah,

4768
01:57:24,231 --> 01:57:24,470
it'll,

4769
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:25,071
it'll be error.

4770
01:57:25,071 --> 01:57:26,060
Probably fourth quarter.

4771
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:27,340
December.

4772
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:27,680
All right,

4773
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:29,300
let us know when that's going to air and,

4774
01:57:29,301 --> 01:57:29,710

4775
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:31,310

4787
01:57:46,371 --> 01:57:48,260

4788

Now.

4791
01:57:50,721 --> 01:57:51,770
I think we've left her.

4792
01:57:51,771 --> 01:57:53,060
She had 19.

4793
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:56,360
She's still got 19 popular girl.

4794
01:57:56,930 --> 01:57:57,800
Not really.

4795
01:57:58,190 --> 01:57:59,023
Um,

4796
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:00,170
maybe she just,

4797
01:58:00,171 --> 01:58:00,710
uh,

4798
01:58:00,710 --> 01:58:01,543
maybe she can't,

4799
01:58:01,580 --> 01:58:02,750
won't let anybody in.

4800
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:03,890
Maybe nobody gives a fuck.

4801
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:04,741
Uh,

4802
01:58:04,741 --> 01:58:05,271
