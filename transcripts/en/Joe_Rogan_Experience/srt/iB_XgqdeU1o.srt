1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,560
Yes,
and we're live.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,030
Hello,
Danica Patrick,

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,980
welcome to the show.
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,450
Thanks for doing this.
I appreciate it.

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm excited to be here.
You're in a tense lady.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,560
You've got a lot of intensity when I met
you,

7
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:12,430
like right away.
I'm like,

8
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,620
whoa.
GotTa.

9
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,100
Go take this one in.

10
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:15,831
Well,
you know,

11
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:18,080
it's the handshake and then it's the uh,
you know,

12
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,880
when someone actually looks you in the
eye.

13
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,360
Well you have to be intense.
I mean what you do for living is

14
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,800
probably one of the craziest things a
human being can do.

15
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,910
Do you think?
So it's up there for a job.

16
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,350
How fast do you go?

17
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,360
Uh,
200.

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,540
That's,
I mean like,

19
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:38,820
you know,
Nascar's top speed is probably 2:15 indy

20
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,590
cars,
maybe more like 2:40 and I'm going to do

21
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:44,340
the Daytona 500 next month and then the
indy 500 in May.

22
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,540
So,
um,

23
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,230
those are going to be my last few races.
So I'm the last one's ever.

24
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,230
Yeah,
really?

25
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,220
Yeah,
it's a,

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,370
this is my Danica double goodbye to her.

27
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,790
Why are you doing that?
How can we do an a Danica double

28
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,380
goodbye?
Is it enough?

29
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:59,214
Is Enough?

30
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,540
I'm ready.
Um,

31
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,790
I mean I love racing but I love other
things too.

32
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,020
So,
um,

33
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,260
you know,
I'm okay with transitioning out and

34
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:11,710
there was a lot of things that were kind
of just pointing me in this direction in

35
00:01:11,711 --> 00:01:14,800
2017 stuff that has never happened to me
before.

36
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,930
Um,
to kind of,

37
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,930
yeah,
head towards the exit a little bit,

38
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,620
but I'm good with that.
I'm a very decisive person so this is

39
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:25,570
probably one of them that I thought
about it a little bit,

40
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,770
um,
as far as like how to be done or,

41
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,440
or if to be done I guess.
But um,

42
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,140
the,
how was the hardest part.

43
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:35,110
My agent kept calling and saying,
what about this and what if you did

44
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:35,790
that?
And I'm like,

45
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,270
no,
no,

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,910
no,
you all need to get ready for me to be

47
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,340
done please.
Wow.

48
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,280
And uh,
so then he came up with the,

49
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,010
he's like,
what if you finish up at the,

50
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,690
at Daytona for the 500?

51
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,590
And I was like,
what about the indy 500?

52
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,630
He goes and I was really only referring
to the indy 500 and he was like,

53
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,490
well I'd,
I'd love you to do both.

54
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,570
And I was like,
oh,

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,010
well that's a good idea.
So um,

56
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,550
there's this thing in racing called the
double,

57
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:05,551
which is doing the indy 500 on Memorial
Day weekend on Sunday and then flying

58
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:09,190
straight to charlotte to do the coke 600
afterwards and that's kind of known as

59
00:02:09,191 --> 00:02:10,840
the double,
um,

60
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,780
but this is what we're calling the
Danica double and it has to do with just

61
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,470
having spent a chunk of my career in
Indycar and a chunk of my career in

62
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,960
Nascar and it just kinda feels like the
right way to go out.

63
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,900
I don't know,
it didn't,

64
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:23,830
it wasn't clear.
It was a bit of a murky end as far as

65
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:26,920
like what's going to happen,
am I going to race next year full time

66
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,620
or not?
And it just kind of went suit too long

67
00:02:29,621 --> 00:02:33,940
for me to have like a proper.
I'm done sort of moment in my head.

68
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:35,500
So this was just a great way to do it.

69
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,780
So when you say that things happened in
2017,

70
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,700
that didn't happen before,
like what do you mean?

71
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,930
I got a sponsor leave me.
My primary sponsor left at the beginning

72
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,650
of the year.
I mean I,

73
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,130
I signed a contract and when Mercury's
in retrograde so,

74
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,510
you know,
I screwed myself there,

75
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,700
but.
No,

76
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,740
no,
I don't know if it was true.

77
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,940
So,
um,

78
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,760
I,
I guess maybe the universe is a little

79
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,580
bit more straightforward

80
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,740
than we think it is.
A lot of good things probably happened

81
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,070
during that time.
Just in 2017 or during retrograde

82
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,520
mercury in retrograde.
I don't believe in any of that shit.

83
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,130
Oh yeah.
I think people look for some sort of

84
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:15,790
like hidden meaning to things when it
comes to like astrology.

85
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,903
Yeah.
Yeah.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
I do try and understand it.
It's quite,

87
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,490
I'm trying to understand how it really
matters,

88
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,360
but I don't know.
There's definitely some things,

89
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:30,960
at least with the moon that goes on.
I mean the water changes with the moon,

90
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:34,970
so doesn't that mean that other things
should to whether it be energetically or

91
00:03:34,971 --> 00:03:35,810
something like that?

92
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,380
I think the the water and the moon thing
kind of makes sense a little bit,

93
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,380
a little bit,
but I think it's probably just like

94
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,190
barely one way or the other.
Maybe it's a whisper on the wind kind of

95
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:47,930
stuff.
I think it's more in your head,

96
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,870
so stop putting my crystals outside to
charge under the full moon.

97
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,300
Maybe not so important.
I would say it's not that important to

98
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:56,360
do some something.
Someone sent me about the army using

99
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,270
crystals and I was like,
this has got to be like an onion article

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,220
that the army,
the army was using crystals for like

101
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,040
medic seat.
Think if you could see it.

102
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,650
Find that.
Yeah.

103
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,400
It's just the wounded people.
Yeah.

104
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,120
Look at this stupid shit I don't even
know.

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,850
I don't know.
I'm sure if it's real,

106
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,970
US Army's new holistic medics treating
gunshot wounds with crystals and

107
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,460
essential oils is satire.
Thank you.

108
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,630
Thank you.
I knew essential oils,

109
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,970
don't you think there's a plant that
cures everything out there?

110
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,250
There probably is something like that in
the Amazon.

111
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,540
Maybe not cures everything,
but there's probably a lot of stuff that

112
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,160
we come from.
Right.

113
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,930
So pair that up with some high
vibrational stones,

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
high vibrational stones.
Woo tense.

115
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,020
So I'm back to back to my sponsor
leaving your sponsor,

116
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,863
leaving you.
You were like,

117
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,510
that's it.

118
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,490
It's just a never happened to me before.
I've always been someone that's been

119
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,520
really well funded and always had a
sponsor,

120
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,310
always had a sponsor and never a
problem.

121
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,680
And so,
um,

122
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,190
yeah,
it was just things like that were

123
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,500
happening.
I got into a few big wrecks in a row,

124
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:05,120
like probably three and six weeks that
were,

125
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,020
you know,
like I was bawling in the medical center

126
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:11,830
after the third one going well,
I mean I was running like a top 10 and a

127
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,370
car blew a rotor and clipped me and put
me in the wall.

128
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:18,670
I was on fire.
Another driver broke his back.

129
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,100
I mean it was a huge accident and I'm
like,

130
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,930
what is,
what is the message?

131
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:24,790
What is someone trying to tell me right
now?

132
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,780
And so,
you know,

133
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:29,980
after I collected my shit and got my
face looking like halfway decent to go

134
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:31,840
talk to the media out there,
I finally got out.

135
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,630
But yeah,
just stuff like that was happening and I

136
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:37,600
was,
I was in a very go with the flow mood in

137
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:40,120
2017.
I wasn't pushing for anything because I

138
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:42,970
wasn't really sure what I wanted.
So I just let the universe take care of

139
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:43,770
it.

140
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,810
You've got a very interesting way of
looking at things.

141
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,820
You when things go wrong and you're
like,

142
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:51,150
what is the universe trying to tell me?
You're not like,

143
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,380
well I drive really fucking fast for a
living at.

144
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,040
Sometimes shit goes wrong.
Happens to it seems like

145
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,120
car racing is just inherently crazy.
I mean that's what I was saying when I

146
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,360
was saying you do one of the craziest
things you can for a living going 240

147
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:10,361
miles an hour is no joke and metal and
rubber and things just.

148
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,480
Yeah,
trust in something when you're out there

149
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:14,920
because you're doing,
like you said,

150
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,800
200 plus miles an hour with,
you know,

151
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,030
people that aren't your friends around
you with walls around you as well.

152
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,670
So you know,
you kind of got to put your trust in

153
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:25,504
something else.

154
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,110
Yeah.
That's why I was getting at that because

155
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:31,760
I think the way you think is the a lot.
It's very similar to the way fighter

156
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,670
pilots think.
Fighter pilots have a lot of weird

157
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:37,580
superstitions and a lot of,
a lot of pilots do,

158
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:39,410
a lot of people that are involved in
intense things.

159
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:44,411
It's almost like in order to get through
the task at hand,

160
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,100
you almost have to delegate certain
aspects of reality to,

161
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,890
to fate or to chance or to.
Right?

162
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,650
Yeah.

163
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,580
I believe that.
Yeah.

164
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,940
I mean they uh,
have a tattoo on my back,

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,560
one of his,
it's an American flag.

166
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:02,530
I got that when I was 19,
it's like an American flag that fades to

167
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:04,170
a checkered flag.
And then there's a.

168
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,110
and then I got that when I was 19 when I
was about 27,

169
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:11,500
I went and got the rest,
which was angel wings and some stars.

170
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,820
And um,
you know,

171
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,830
it's not the most beautiful piece of
art,

172
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:18,910
but it means something to me.
It won't be really beautiful in 30

173
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:20,440
years.
I'm sure 40.

174
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,790
Um,
but it's,

175
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,481
uh,
but yeah,

176
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:23,800
I mean,
my point is,

177
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:25,930
is that I would definitely pray that,
you know,

178
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:29,290
I was taken care of and you've got to
hand that off and just go do your damn

179
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,460
job and not be afraid and just trust in
the fate of everything.

180
00:07:33,461 --> 00:07:35,400
And Yeah.
So that's kind of where the angel wings.

181
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,360
Well,
I think that people that do inherently

182
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:43,361
risky things oftentimes look for signs
or look for some sort of,

183
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,320
you know,
some direction,

184
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:48,820
some message from the universe.
And that's why I was.

185
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,260
Well,
I mean,

186
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,320
I feel like as a race car driver,
I've thought about this a lot lately and

187
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:58,321
I wonder how much of our job is a little
less even just feeling what's happening

188
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:01,090
and how much is actually maybe more
intuitive.

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,020
Like maybe we're,
maybe we're having more intuitive

190
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,420
understanding of what's going on and
what's coming.

191
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:12,421
Then we realized we just are so um,
everything's happening so fast and that

192
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:14,840
you,
you,

193
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,671
you just think,
oh,

194
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:16,930
I'm,
I have really good feel.

195
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,920
You know,
I mean,

196
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,510
I'm sure there's some of that too.
But um,

197
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:25,480
so I think that maybe maybe you're maybe
maybe athletes or people at an elite

198
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:27,820
level are more in touch with that
intuitive side,

199
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,440
that finite,
like last thread of feel.

200
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,620
Maybe it's beyond feel.
It's a knowing

201
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,930
that makes sense.
I mean,

202
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,170
if you think about the amount of time
that you've spent involved in that

203
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,930
intense activity in this,
you know,

204
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,770
they say that people get road rage for
one of the reasons why people get road

205
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:52,771
rage is because when you're driving you
are reacting to things that could happen

206
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,940
instantaneously very quickly.
So your at a very heightened state and

207
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,940
people know someone cuts you off,
you start freaking out,

208
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:04,320
like instantly they go from one to 10
right away and the reason is because

209
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,780
they're always at seven and they don't
even realize they're at seven.

210
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:10,670
When you were in the car,
when your probably at like 13,

211
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,030
this one goes to 11.

212
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,850
Yeah.
You mean your cranked up?

213
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,850
Right.
And so you're probably seeing things and

214
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:20,750
feeling things that the average person
they don't experience in their life.

215
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,340
Yeah.
You just working at that top little top

216
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:30,341
level of
feeling of,

217
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,280
of,
of focus.

218
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:38,890
Was that a dictate where you call in the
zone where it kind of almost become

219
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,380
slightly out of body?
You don't even know how it's happening.

220
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,214
It's just happening.

221
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,120
Well,
I would imagine like you kind of melt

222
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:46,020
away and you're just.

223
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,830
Yeah,
totally involved task.

224
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,980
When I think about what I have to do,
like let's say as an example,

225
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,980
coming in for a pit stop and you got
your throttle brake,

226
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,350
clutch gears,
all the different things that you have

227
00:09:56,351 --> 00:10:00,490
to do to think about it logically.
What you have to do is so much more

228
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:03,730
confusing than just going on instinct of
like just do it

229
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,230
because you have to use,
you only have two feet,

230
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:10,810
but you have three pedals and you have
to use all three pedals at some point in

231
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,000
time,
but you want to be ready for everything

232
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,490
and you,
you're coming in like with the clutch in

233
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,070
on the break,
but then you have to get back to the get

234
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:19,870
to the,
get to the throttle just in time,

235
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:22,480
but you have to have the clutch in and
you have to hold the brake so you make

236
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,130
sure you don't roll.
There's all kinds of things you have to

237
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:26,860
do using all three pedals,
which you have two feet and so when you

238
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:28,330
kind of,
when you have to think about what you

239
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,980
have to do,
it's a little more overwhelming than

240
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,440
just doing it to drive a manual in real
life.

241
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,790
I would.
I love it.

242
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,770
Easy.
Yeah,

243
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:35,604
I do too.

244
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,170
Yeah,
but I mean a lot of people,

245
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,000
it seems like it's kind of a dying
thing.

246
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,050
Yeah,
it is.

247
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,870
I mean even indy cars went to paddle,
shifting before I was done,

248
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:46,500
it was h pattern and then it was
sequential gearbox and then it was

249
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:48,570
paddle shifting and then.
But Nascar,

250
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,640
Nascar still still got the old h
pattern.

251
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,180
That left leg is important for the whole
feel of the thing.

252
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:56,110
Right?
Well especially in an indy car,

253
00:10:56,111 --> 00:10:58,260
in any car you actually have a full on
dead pedal,

254
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,080
so you have all three pedals and then
you have a dead pedal,

255
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:04,740
which is important because you spend a
lot of time with your foot there,

256
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,520
but it is part of the field.
It is absolutely part of the feel of the

257
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,110
car,
especially with all the g loads.

258
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,700
How did you get involved in racing?
I raced go karts when I was a kid.

259
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,260
My sister and my sister wanted to race,
go carts and I just didn't want to get

260
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,630
left out so it turned out I was all
right.

261
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,020
It and I kept going,
but it's,

262
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,430
it's a very unusual path.
Well,

263
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,950
I mean I did everything though.
I was a played like coach pitch.

264
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:31,020
Then tee ball,
I was in the band,

265
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:33,870
the choir.
I took voice lessons.

266
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:35,880
I was,
I played basketball,

267
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,530
volleyball,
cheerleading.

268
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,200
Um,
I played in every sport.

269
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,680
Um,
I took tumbling classes and then I also

270
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,510
tried racing.
So you've always been intense?

271
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
Yeah,
yeah,

272
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:47,814
for sure.

273
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,610
Did you know at a certain age that you
wanted to be a race car driver?

274
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,000
Well,
when I was 10 I decided that I wanted to

275
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,100
go to college for engineering so I could
learn how to work on my race car and I

276
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:00,390
realized I did not have to do that.
I did not have it.

277
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,480
Yeah,
that's what I thought I did.

278
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,310
I didn't have to do that.

279
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,790
Be An engineer so that you could work on
your race card,

280
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,450
you know?
Do you understand how crazy that is?

281
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,250
When I was 10 years old to three
thinking that,

282
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,084
well,

283
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,410
I dunno.

284
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,410
Do you think you're born that way or am
I an old,

285
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
like what do you think about that?
Like to be thinking that way when I'm 10

286
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:21,730
years old,
like you know,

287
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:25,780
some people are just so much different
or more mature further along.

288
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:28,570
Is it?
Why do you think that is?

289
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,620
That's a very good question.
I don't think it's entirely possible

290
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,720
that memory gets transferred through DNA
and that there are certain people that

291
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:42,130
have a long line of adventurous people
and their family and that gets

292
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,520
transferred to the DNA of the children.
I think it's entirely possible.

293
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,110
I have.

294
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,200
I have three children.
Not a spiritual reincarnation.

295
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,690
No.
Maybe.

296
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,620
I mean,
look,

297
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,140
that's entirely possible too.
I would never.

298
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,920
I would never say no to that because if
you're living this life,

299
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,290
I mean nobody asked to live this life.
You just here.

300
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,050
Right?
Who knows if you get to do it again,

301
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,210
I mean we're.
We're assuming that you don't get to do

302
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:08,450
it again because we're assuming that
time goes on this sort of linear way,

303
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,610
but maybe it just does.
For you in this life,

304
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,600
it's entirely possible that there's
infinite number of lives being lived out

305
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,140
in infinite timelines all
simultaneously.

306
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,020
We're just experiencing this one.
We don't even know what happens when we

307
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:22,310
sleep.
You go to sleep,

308
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,600
close your eyes if some crazy dream
about godzilla chase.

309
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,610
Anyone you're on a skateboard,
you wake up in the morning and you just

310
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:31,490
assume that you're on the same timeline
that you were on before,

311
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,740
you know,
because you have to astral.

312
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,620
Who knows?
I don't know.

313
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:40,100
I have children and in one of the things
that's really fascinating about watching

314
00:13:40,101 --> 00:13:42,990
a child develop from a baby to a,
you know,

315
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:45,350
a kid and see their personalities.
Like you realize,

316
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:49,370
like there's a lot of stuff that's just,
that's what they come with.

317
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,870
Yeah.
They're just different.

318
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,290
They're just different.
Why?

319
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,183
You know,
why,

320
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,220
why was I thinking about being an
engineer when I was 10 years old?

321
00:13:57,221 --> 00:14:01,090
Why was I brave enough to go live in
England by myself when I was 16 and all

322
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,290
good with it.
And you know,

323
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,920
why?
Why,

324
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,460
why,
why am I intent?

325
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,230
Why did,
why was I intense when you met me?

326
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,550
You know what I mean?

327
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,080
Well,
I think part of your intensity is

328
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:14,210
probably.
If I had to guess,

329
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,890
if I could be presumptuous,
you're a woman involved in a very manly

330
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:23,891
activity and I'm sure men probably test
you in some sort of a weird way and so I

331
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:29,601
bet along the way you've developed this
sort of way of addressing them right

332
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,880
away.
Like a listen motherfucker

333
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,430
sometimes just like.

334
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:36,830
Yeah,
I mean I think you probably have to,

335
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,691
you know,
I would imagine.

336
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:37,780
Yeah,

337
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,090
to be strong you have to.
I remember when I was younger and going

338
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:44,830
to meetings with companies or team
bosses,

339
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,890
people like that and was the advice
given was don't say,

340
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,020
Oh I the sun maybe like,
you'd be sure about what you want.

341
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,370
And I remember that.
So yeah,

342
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:58,310
a nature versus nurture.
Some of it's learned,

343
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,390
but some of it's just there.

344
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,240
Yeah.
You can't turn a timid person into you.

345
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,240
Maybe you could,
but I mean it's not,

346
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:10,370
not likely you would.
You seem to be like this person.

347
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,610
This is just who you are and if you're
telling me that at 10 years old you were

348
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:15,740
thinking about being an engineer so he
could work on race cars.

349
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,620
That's not normal.
What's normal though?

350
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,150
What'd you want to do when you were 10
years old?

351
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,150
I had no idea.
I probably wanted to be an artist.

352
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,010
I think I want it to be an artist.
I mean that,

353
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,310
that follows this vein sort of.
Yeah.

354
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,790
But I used to want to draw comic books.
I did a lot of that.

355
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,780
Yeah.
So that was probably what I wanted,

356
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,620
but I was never like,
what I need to do is like,

357
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,190
I need to figure out a way to make my
hand stronger so that faster you see

358
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,300
Steven mind.
I did not go to college.

359
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,770
In fact I didn't even finish high
school.

360
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,910
You didn't at all?
Nope.

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,120
I left when I was 16 and I got my ged.
Wow.

362
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,980
I failed the first time.
Wow.

363
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,330
You want to know why?
Okay,

364
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:55,700
good.
Because that's like a horrible,

365
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:58,280
like I failed my ged.
Oh Geez.

366
00:15:58,281 --> 00:15:59,360
Um,
I,

367
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,360
uh,
the constitution test is something,

368
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,610
at least in Illinois,
I don't know if you have to pass it in

369
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,290
every state,
but in Illinois you do.

370
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:10,730
And so in eighth grade to go to high
school you have to get a 70 percent or

371
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:13,640
above to go to high school.
I got a 70,

372
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,880
so I went to high school.
Now I'm like a three point five and

373
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:20,510
above student,
like I was a's and b's not a problem for

374
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:23,420
some reason.
The constitution and government and all

375
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:27,230
of those sectors and names and holy
moly,

376
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,240
it's so confusing to me.
So,

377
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:32,030
um,
so then when it came time to do my take

378
00:16:32,031 --> 00:16:33,650
my ged,
I didn't study at all.

379
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:38,000
I just took the test and I failed the
constitution test.

380
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,640
So prepare for it.
That's all right.

381
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,140
Yeah,
I mean,

382
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,400
I,
I've never studied in my life so I just

383
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,383
think no,

384
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,400
really?
Yeah.

385
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,760
The only thing I study up,
well study,

386
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,420
uh,
if I'm doing a speech or if I'm doing

387
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,220
something for a,
for a company,

388
00:16:56,221 --> 00:17:00,360
for a sponsor and I need to make sure
that I have my talking points ready.

389
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:03,870
I mean,
I spent 15 minutes or 30 minutes or five

390
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:07,290
minutes making sure that I'm organized
in my head about what it is that I need

391
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,800
to get out there so that I can do my job
and deliver.

392
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,350
But other than that,
I've never studied in school.

393
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,350
Keep in mind,
I didn't have to go to a school that

394
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:17,184
long.
I never.

395
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,530
I mean I only went to school until I was
16,

396
00:17:19,531 --> 00:17:21,300
so it's been a really,
really,

397
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:23,940
really long time since I went to school.
But you're very smart.

398
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,170
Oh,
I don't know.

399
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
See,
I know you're smart.

400
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:27,834
Thank you.
Well,

401
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,200
what do you do you read?
Um,

402
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,480
I actually,
I want to start reading more.

403
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:34,980
I've got a lot of books that I want to
read.

404
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:37,500
I started reading a book called the
Holographic universe.

405
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,730
Okay.
Michael Talbot,

406
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:39,564
right?
Yeah.

407
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,250
It's a good book.
Is that weird?

408
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,930
There's a lot of stuff in there and
you're like,

409
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,220
wait a minute.
It's this kind of drugs.

410
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,770
There's a lot of woo in there.
I think

411
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,620
a little woo.
So good.

412
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,410
I even simple books like the alchemist
and stuff.

413
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,090
I just really want to read these books.
I mean,

414
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,800
and um,
yeah,

415
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,060
she does more woo woo woo shit.
Yeah,

416
00:18:00,061 --> 00:18:02,850
I am.
Why do you think that that is the race

417
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:05,070
car thing?
Do you think that has nothing to do

418
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:06,270
with,
it's just who you are.

419
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,330
That's just who I am.
I remember getting a psychic reading

420
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,610
when I was 18 years old.
Living in England.

421
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,580
Yeah.
[inaudible].

422
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,620
Yeah.
I,

423
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,790
I bought like Linda Goodman's love
signs,

424
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,620
like astrology book when I was a kid.

425
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,750
So when you were 16 and you got a
psychic reading,

426
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,990
totally had a mood ring.
Mood rings are great.

427
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,020
Sorry,
go ahead.

428
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,330
Do what did,
what did they tell you?

429
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,800
They tell you anything you can remember.

430
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,510
I can't remember,
but when I was talking about signing my

431
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,540
contract and when Mercury's in
retrograde,

432
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:38,000
that was,
I talked to an astrologer and she said,

433
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,830
just don't sign any contracts.
And I was like,

434
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:41,360
well,
what a bizarre.

435
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,960
I mean I was kind of learning about some
of this stuff because it was quite a few

436
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,950
years ago now.
But I,

437
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,873
I,
um,

438
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,630
I remember the next,
a year and a half later or so,

439
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,090
and you know,
shit hit the fan and I was like,

440
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,000
that damn astrologer was right now,
okay,

441
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,640
mercury in retrograde,
it's pretty standard information if

442
00:18:58,641 --> 00:19:00,680
you're in astrology at all.
But um,

443
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,750
but yeah,
she said,

444
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,580
I saw a psychic in Sedona a few years
ago and she said that professionally

445
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,710
over the next four years,
your life's going to go boom,

446
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:10,161
boom,
boom,

447
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:10,581
boom,
boom.

448
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:11,180
And I thought,
man,

449
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,340
I'm going to win a bunch of races,
there's going to be awesome.

450
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,160
And instead I,
um,

451
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,940
uh,
have a clothing line now I have a book

452
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,190
that just came out at the beginning of
the year,

453
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,280
my wines finally been for sale for a
year now.

454
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,800
And there's other projects I'm working
on too,

455
00:19:27,801 --> 00:19:28,634
but,
uh,

456
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,510
and,
you know,

457
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,640
finishing off my career in a pretty big
way.

458
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:33,260
So I guess she was right.

459
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,020
I think that lady's full of Shit,
I guess.

460
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,310
I think she looked at you and like,
this chick's gonna kick ass.

461
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:38,840
I'll.

462
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,550
Somebody thinks she recognized me.
Then she's like,

463
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:42,110
okay.
So when I sat down she was like,

464
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:44,600
all right,
the way it works here is like I just see

465
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:49,310
words or symbols or things around you.
So if I just look around like don't

466
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,830
think I'm not paying attention to him,
that's just how I see things.

467
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:52,664
And so I'm like,
all right,

468
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,970
I'm sitting there and she's telling me
all this stuff and she says whatever my

469
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:58,430
job is,
I travel a lot and things like that.

470
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,350
And then she all of a sudden kind of was
looking at me.

471
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:01,130
She'll go over,
she goes,

472
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,620
celebrity are you a celebrity?
And I was like,

473
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,580
I only am if you think I am just usually
how I answer people.

474
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,560
Um,
so I don't know.

475
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,800
Did she know who I was up in Sedona?
They don't watch a lot of TV.

476
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:13,940
I don't think.
You don't think so?

477
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,030
They sneak

478
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,090
it in when no one's looking their lunch
break areas.

479
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,810
Just the arrest their crystals on the
TV.

480
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,740
I just think he's sending positive vibes
almost all bullshit.

481
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:30,920
I think almost all psychic stuff is
bullshit.

482
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:35,000
I think you don't believe in the.
Being intuitive into intuition is a

483
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:37,220
different thing.
I think when people sit down,

484
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,830
they go,
I see you in a past life and you are

485
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,550
handmade and you,
you,

486
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,100
you worked by the river,
like,

487
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,470
get the fuck outta here.
I think that's all bullshit.

488
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,040
I think those people are nuts and
there's a lot

489
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,530
of people that want to think they're
special and they want to think they have

490
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:54,430
special gifts in there and people get
really good at reading people.

491
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:59,431
I know people who are professional
magicians and they are expert cold

492
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:01,180
readers.
They could sit down with you and breed

493
00:21:01,181 --> 00:21:04,840
and tell you remarkable amounts of
things with your about your life,

494
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,500
just with your answers to questions,
but they'll tell you right away.

495
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,780
They're not psychic.
Like there's a guy named bandit check

496
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,640
who's excellent at it.
He's fantastic.

497
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:15,370
He does a show in Vegas and he freaks
people out because they'll tell you

498
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:16,960
right away,
I am not a psychic.

499
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,130
He's like,
this is A.

500
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,460
There's techniques to this and it's
something I've been doing my whole life

501
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,930
and you just get really good at it and
he knows how to do it and these people

502
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:27,940
are con artists.
They're they're con artists.

503
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,740
They trick you into thinking that they
have,

504
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,600
but they might even believe it
themselves.

505
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:34,270
That's part of the problem.
A lot of those people can themselves,

506
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,440
but I think there is something like when
you're thinking about someone and they

507
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,650
call you like out of nowhere and you
haven't told me

508
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,230
the prevalence of synchronicities that
pop up in your life and you're like,

509
00:21:43,231 --> 00:21:44,630
oh my God,
I was thinking about that movie and

510
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,910
there it is on TV.
Yeah.

511
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,980
It's entirely possible that there is
some bizarre connection that we don't

512
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,910
totally understand to events into people
and into things

513
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,580
well like attracts like or where
attention goes.

514
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,870
Energy flows.

515
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,300
Yeah.
There's probably a lot to that.

516
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,180
Certain magnetism to those two things
that bring it together.

517
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,103
Yes,
maybe,

518
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,970
but I think it's very,
very poorly understood and there's a lot

519
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:17,500
of woo that's clouding it up in that
wound gets in the way of rational,

520
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,570
logical,
educated people.

521
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,810
Even considering it,
they dismiss it instantaneously because

522
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,300
it's connected to so many assholes with
neon signs.

523
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,040
It's a card reader,
palm reader,

524
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,620
and these people that just.
They're just ripping you off.

525
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,360
That's all they're doing.
They don't have a real job.

526
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,030
They sit down,
they talk to people for a job and you

527
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:37,180
know you could say it's entertainment.
He could say that what they're doing is

528
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,520
they're providing you with a service and
that service.

529
00:22:39,521 --> 00:22:43,360
They sit down with you and and maybe by
telling you that everything's going to

530
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:45,340
be amazing,
you'll walk out of there with a lot of

531
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:47,560
enthusiasm and then life will be
amazing.

532
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,280
Who knows?

533
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,960
Do you believe that?
If you think your life's going to be

534
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:50,794
amazing,
it will be.

535
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:51,461
No,
no.

536
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:54,390
You get hit by a meteor kind of the
house.

537
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,040
You could fall into a crack in the
ground from an earthquake.

538
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:59,920
I mean those people that died in the
tsunami in Thailand,

539
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,490
were they bad people?
No.

540
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,180
Is there any level of woo that's worth
following through on?

541
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,130
I think

542
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,940
it's all things.
I think some.

543
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,510
Some of the connections and the
intuition and some superstitions and

544
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:17,890
ideas that we have are probably based in
this limited understanding that we have

545
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,370
in the connection that we have two
events and humans in life,

546
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,320
but I think there's also bullshit
involved too and all these things get

547
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,450
very cloudy.
I don't think there's an absolute,

548
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:33,570
but I think it's entirely possible that
intuition is a developing sense that we

549
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:38,890
don't totally have yet.
I think if you think about all the

550
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:42,460
things that people can do,
hearing and seeing and touching and

551
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:44,470
smelling all the different senses that
we have,

552
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,140
we assume that that covers the full
gamut of possibilities,

553
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,220
but I don't think that's true.

554
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,770
No,
I think you're right.

555
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,560
Visually,
you know,

556
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,800
we don't see the full spectrum of that.
We see a very,

557
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:59,440
very small amount of things that are out
there.

558
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,320
Yeah.
And our audio is wall.

559
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,130
You know,
we can hear all the sounds.

560
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,410
Yeah.
I mean it's entirely possible that

561
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,300
there's more going,
like there's certain people that just

562
00:24:07,301 --> 00:24:10,530
have a weird feel to them immediately.
Like scale you got get a from this guy.

563
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,030
Yeah.
There's definitely people that they're

564
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:18,031
giving off weird feelings and it could
be that your reading their intent and

565
00:24:18,151 --> 00:24:21,940
some sort of a way that you don't see
visually,

566
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:25,480
but you recognized by their body
language or it could be a bunch of

567
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:25,850
things.
Yeah.

568
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,880
Well he didn't run when you met me,
so I appreciate that.

569
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,680
Now we're probably scheduled to do this
interview,

570
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:30,930
so yeah,

571
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,910
couldn't,
but I was looking forward to this.

572
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,520
Why would I run?
I mean I was,

573
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,730
I was impressed by your intensity,
but I expected that in a way.

574
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,250
I mean I just,
I don't see how you could be a race car

575
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:44,280
driver and not being,
especially being a woman in a race car

576
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,370
driver and not be in touch.

577
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,200
So that's nothing I even thought about
until I was like 14.

578
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,850
Um,
for the first few days,

579
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,290
abrasive,
way late in life,

580
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:56,550
I think about being a girl out there.
It wasn't until I had cameras following

581
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,860
me around my schools and stuff that I
was like,

582
00:24:58,861 --> 00:24:59,730
all right,
maybe this is.

583
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,560
And then they start asking you about it.
They're like,

584
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,820
what's it like to be a girl?
You're like,

585
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:04,100
Shit.
And originally I don't know really,

586
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,490
I haven't really thought about that.
Um,

587
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:09,840
how many other girls do it?
I mean there are various girls here and

588
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:10,660
there,
but

589
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,320
you know,
all of Nascar.

590
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:14,210
How many women are right or racing?
Oh,

591
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,680
I'm at my level,
not zero man.

592
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,880
That's crazy.
Wow.

593
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,860
That's pretty crazy.
I know.

594
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,160
Yeah,
that's crazy.

595
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,730
Well,
take it from me.

596
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,780
I'm going to ask you what's it like to
be a girl in racing?

597
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:26,370
I'm like,
AH,

598
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,150
well I don't really know what it's like
to be a guy.

599
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,060
So,
you know,

600
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,860
I only have my perspective.
That's true,

601
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,581
you know,
I mean,

602
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:36,100
I don't like being a girl versus a guy.
What's the difference?

603
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,050
I don't know.
What's it like to be a guy?

604
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,490
Yeah,
it probably be different,

605
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,770
but I think that like,
what's it like to be a woman that's the

606
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:49,220
only woman who's in Nascar at your
level?

607
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:51,050
That's,
that's a valid question.

608
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:51,950
I mean,
that's crazy.

609
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,660
How does everybody else treat you?

610
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,920
Yeah.
That,

611
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,170
that,
that really is the main question I can't

612
00:25:57,171 --> 00:25:59,030
answer because I'm not them.
And I,

613
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,770
I know that,
um,

614
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,960
from,
from it enough experience now because I

615
00:26:03,961 --> 00:26:05,480
used to not really look into it much in,
in,

616
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,330
in the indycar days,
you couldn't hit each other,

617
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:09,141
you know,
you really,

618
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,230
I mean it was,
you know,

619
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,250
you could block and things like that.
So there were some guys out there that

620
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:14,960
were assholes and I didn't like them,
but,

621
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,550
you know,
sometimes every driver has some drive,

622
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,850
some other drivers that they don't
really get along with.

623
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,640
And so,
but in Nascar you can hit each other and

624
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,730
it's bumpers and um,
which is really cool,

625
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:28,400
but it also isn't cool because if
somebody wants to do what they can.

626
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,880
So what would I say?
I would say that they don't want to get

627
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,530
passed by a girl.
And you know what,

628
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,020
I don't either.
Is that weird?

629
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,790
No,
I really don't.

630
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,220
I mean I've driven,
I've raced with girls and I don't,

631
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,443
I don't like it.

632
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,000
So do you,
do you,

633
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,010
do you feel differently when a

634
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,690
guy passes you then when a girl passes
you?

635
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,960
Probably,
yeah.

636
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,010
In what way?
Just go internally that bitch.

637
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,123
I'm like,

638
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,120
can't believe my car isn't faster,
right?

639
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,770
This
what happens?

640
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,770
The guy that passed,
good or not good that I'm like,

641
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,690
you know,
come on the radio and I'd be like,

642
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,351
uh,
yeah,

643
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:09,490
I just want you to see that what car
passed me and how bad my car is out now.

644
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,550
Right now I'm.
So it happens with guys too,

645
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:13,890
but you know,
I don't know.

646
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,640
It's just a cultural norm that girls
aren't good and allow,

647
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,980
you know,
aren't very good and that they,

648
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:26,070
they somewhat don't belong and I get
like the little bit of animosity at

649
00:27:26,081 --> 00:27:27,940
first,
but I would have thought that people

650
00:27:27,941 --> 00:27:29,950
would have got,
got used to it a little bit more than

651
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:31,600
they did.
So.

652
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:34,390
But you have that cultural animosity.
You were saying a little bit.

653
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,243
Yeah.

654
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,910
Comes from.
But when you say that it's a,

655
00:27:37,911 --> 00:27:40,010
it's a cultural norm that girls aren't
good.

656
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:41,450
You don't think about that about
yourself?

657
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,310
No.
Yeah.

658
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,410
See,
I knew that you don't have any doubts.

659
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,251
No,
I like it.

660
00:27:46,251 --> 00:27:47,061
Everyone out there,
I'm like,

661
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:50,060
you suck because of this and I'm going
to beat you because of that.

662
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:51,950
And Oh God,
I hate you.

663
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:54,500
I don't think because I'm a girl,
I'm not as good as.

664
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:55,221
No,
no,

665
00:27:55,221 --> 00:27:56,810
not at all.
So why would you think that about the

666
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:59,510
other grades?
Just I'm not used to it.

667
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,610
Right.
You just something you're not used to.

668
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,690
Yeah,
that makes sense.

669
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,640
Yeah.
Well also it's like you're unique.

670
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,480
I mean,
what if you were out there in the gym

671
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:09,030
and some girl comes and picks up more
weight than you and you're like,

672
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,780
oh,
that's weird that on roids she probably

673
00:28:12,781 --> 00:28:15,150
wouldn't be,
but Amazon freak,

674
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,840
some genetic freak.
I try to sign her,

675
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,810
bring her to,
you know,

676
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:19,760
do,
you know,

677
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,530
throw a punch.
I don't know.

678
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,230
I think um,
I think we all have cultural prejudices

679
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,900
to a certain extent.
Whether we admit it or not.

680
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,270
And you know,
maybe you're not a big it,

681
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,420
maybe you're just maybe just have
reservations and you're pleasantly

682
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,510
surprised when people surpass those
expectations,

683
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,600
you know?
But I would think that you would

684
00:28:40,601 --> 00:28:45,601
experience probably more discrimination
as a woman then.

685
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,620
I mean,
if you think about a woman doing almost

686
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,050
any other job,
like if you're telling me you're the

687
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:58,051
only woman that does that and you're at
this intense macho job,

688
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,810
this is a fucking intense job.
I mean,

689
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:06,811
you'd go on to 100 miles an hour.
Everybody's nuts.

690
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,720
That's a crazy job.
And you're out there at the top of the

691
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:12,850
food chain with all these men.
Yeah,

692
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,700
I would.
I would imagine there's two things that

693
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:17,830
happened.
There's a bunch of guys that treat you

694
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:19,750
with respect there.
They're like,

695
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:21,340
wow,
really compressed.

696
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,170
They're cool with you.
They're like,

697
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,410
she's one of us,
and then there's a few that are just

698
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:29,560
dicks and the those decks are just
encourageable

699
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,080
man.
The amount of times I wish I was good at

700
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:36,690
taking people out.
I wish people knew how hard it was to

701
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,480
actually take someone out on track.
It's not that easy.

702
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,030
You would because you can risk taking
yourself.

703
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,903
Yeah,
exactly.

704
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,980
Yeah,
and if your car doesn't handle very

705
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,720
well,
you can't get close enough to him.

706
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,210
If you could,
you would just move the air,

707
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,940
which is almost like hitting him and get
him out of the way,

708
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,360
but sometimes the car doesn't handle
well enough so like you'd have to just

709
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:59,380
bomb in there and God willing,
you hit them to get you to slow down and

710
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,890
then they go sailing and you keep going.
But it's risk.

711
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,810
That's a rare moment,
right?

712
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,920
Yeah.
Have you done it before?

713
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,590
Where I've tried to take people.
I suck at it.

714
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:11,920
I absolutely suck at it.
I've taken myself out like three times

715
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,030
trying to do it.
I mean,

716
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:14,200
look,
I'll be the lamb.

717
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:18,730
I don't mind it to make a point.
I'm trying to make a point if someone's

718
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,630
driving like a dick.
Yeah.

719
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,200
So what was the one that was the most
sad was,

720
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,760
um,
uh,

721
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:30,060
it was a couple of years ago.
It was a Martinsville and this was when

722
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:34,350
something was going down with,
it was Matt Kenseth and Joey Logano and

723
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:37,080
it was during the chase,
which is the last 10 races of the

724
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:39,210
season.
And they were in the chase.

725
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:43,650
Matt and Joey and Joey had made it so
that Matt couldn't get in because he

726
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:46,080
took them out a week earlier,
a week or two earlier and then they got

727
00:30:46,081 --> 00:30:48,180
to Martinsville and it's a very,
very small short track.

728
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,630
It's just a half a mile.
And so it,

729
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,520
it's easy to kind of be able to attack
if you want to.

730
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:56,520
And so he just straight took them out
and um,

731
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,770
there was a whole big hoopla about it.
People up in arms thought it was totally

732
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:03,630
unfair and um,
anyway,

733
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:06,840
during the same race,
some asshole hits me,

734
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,600
takes,
spins me out and so I come back and I'm

735
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,470
a lap down or something because he spins
me out and I go to take him out and I

736
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,710
just say off into the corner,
he manages to kind of keep going.

737
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,630
I spin again because I'm horrible at it.
And uh,

738
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,080
turns out that,
you know,

739
00:31:22,081 --> 00:31:26,850
I get a $50,000 fine because I am,
I'm,

740
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:32,100
I'm not racing for position because I
was a lap down and they applied that

741
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,550
because that was also the same race that
Matt and Joey had their big thing and I

742
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:38,050
think maybe joey was leading or
something like that.

743
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,900
I think he was leading and it was on a
restart.

744
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,300
So they weren't racing for position
either.

745
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:46,620
So that was kind of like their rule that
they put forth to make for.

746
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:47,430
I mean,
Joe,

747
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,010
Matt probably got 100 or $200,000,
fine.

748
00:31:50,011 --> 00:31:53,200
But I'm there,
I am not the,

749
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,240
I'm definitely screwed in the scenario.
So I got fined 50 grand for it and I'm

750
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,074
the one that's out.

751
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,500
So if you're another guy,
if you're racing for position,

752
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,380
then it's okay to bump into each other
apparently.

753
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:03,940
Yeah.
So really

754
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,340
you're the one that screwed.
Because if you're racing,

755
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,030
if someone takes you out and then you're
still racing for position now you're

756
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,470
going to have to be potentially,
you know,

757
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,400
putting yourself in another position to
get taken out when they started it.

758
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,840
It's a no win for the person that's
being aggressed that the aggressive.

759
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:22,310
Yeah.

760
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,790
Was it always legal to bump into each
other?

761
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,120
Uh,
it's gone kind of through waves of

762
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:29,380
different rules,
but yeah,

763
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,700
I mean it is legal,
but when,

764
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,220
whenever a big accident happens and
there's a tragedy,

765
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,480
I would assume that that's when they
tightened down the rules sometimes.

766
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,980
Sometimes not.
Sometimes.

767
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,980
Sometimes just accept

768
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,950
that it's happened.
Sometimes it's just usually if there's

769
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:46,520
something like that that happens,
it's not from one person's action that

770
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,700
it's maybe a chain of events that leads
to something like that.

771
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,140
It's one of the rare jobs that you do
that's a sport.

772
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,430
One of the rare sports where the
potential for death is always there.

773
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,683
Yeah,
that's true.

774
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,913
It is true.

775
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,630
Is that one of the reasons why you
decided

776
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,280
not a daredevil?
Like I am not a daredevil.

777
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,330
I went bungee jumping and that is the
bravest thing I've ever done otherwise.

778
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,730
And I only did it because I'm afraid of
heights,

779
00:33:11,731 --> 00:33:14,280
so I just needed to know that if I had
to conquer a fear,

780
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:14,850
I could.
Well,

781
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,910
what's your definition of a daredevil?
Your brake controller?

782
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,560
You could potentially get hurt.
I'm not though.

783
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,940
That's true.
Yeah,

784
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:27,060
but you're a race car driver,
but I'm a methodical driver,

785
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,160
a methodical.
I don't go out there and just,

786
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,310
you know,
hold it wide open until the car does

787
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,330
something and then I'm like up better
lift now I'm like,

788
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:37,650
I'm methodical driver so I build up what
I think what you're saying is you're not

789
00:33:37,651 --> 00:33:41,160
stupid.
I think that's very nice of you.

790
00:33:41,161 --> 00:33:44,580
That's like a really,
really nice way to say that.

791
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,940
Yeah.
You're not dumb,

792
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,350
but you're definitely a daredevil.

793
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,151
Thank you.
Well,

794
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,850
I'm have to be.
There's no way you could not be.

795
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,470
I'm just not.
I'm serious.

796
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,010
Really knows me knows that I'm not
brave.

797
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,810
Oh Wow.
That's so crazy.

798
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,520
I know.
I think you're talking crazy.

799
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,820
Talk over here.
Well,

800
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,230
you know,
it's true.

801
00:34:04,231 --> 00:34:06,450
I,
I just had been grooming this talent

802
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:10,710
since I was 10 and 26 years later I'm.
I'm okay with it.

803
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,610
I think it's both of those things,
but I think there's no doubt that you're

804
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,510
a brave person.

805
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,990
Actually my first time in a go kart was
horrible.

806
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,330
What you your three?
Ten,

807
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,820
10.
And my sister was eight.

808
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,730
My Dad built the go carts.
There's a big parking lot out back.

809
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,090
So we got like spray cans,
wd for whatever,

810
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,070
pop cans,
I don't know,

811
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:31,881
whatever.
Yeah.

812
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:35,510
I grew up in the Midwest,
so pop and set them up in a big circle

813
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:37,740
for my sister and I to go out and drive
around,

814
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:43,110
drive our go carts for the first time.
And my dad made there was the little

815
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:48,290
mistake with the brake pedal and so it
stopped working and since I'm 10 and I'm

816
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,930
really young and dumb and I don't know
what I'm doing.

817
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,490
Young,
dumb and broke.

818
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,324
I guess I was.
Yeah,

819
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,190
like the song goes.
Um,

820
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,110
but I um,
I went to hit the break,

821
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,210
it wasn't there,
so instead of just spinning out or

822
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:02,090
continuing to turn,
I just went straight and I was headed

823
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:06,890
for a trailer,
like kind of a higher elevated trailer

824
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:09,320
which would have resulted in
decapitation.

825
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,700
And I swerved at the last second and hit
a concrete wall and I like go flying and

826
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:18,170
my arm lays back on the,
on the muffler and my cool puffy jacket,

827
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:22,400
Burns and bruises all up my legs and on
my arms.

828
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,830
And um,
that was my first time in a go kart

829
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,490
within,
you know,

830
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,940
five or 10 minutes of being out there.
And so my dad just got a new one and

831
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:32,180
built it and we went racing.
So maybe I am really brave.

832
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:32,930
I don't know.
You're right.

833
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,380
Maybe it's,
I always felt like an indy car to some

834
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,940
degree.
I wasn't brave because people were

835
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:42,810
willing to do things that were
perceivably more brave.

836
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:44,820
But I also,
I did describe them as dumb.

837
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,110
You're right.
So you're probably a little right.

838
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,920
And I'm maybe a little right too,
but you're right.

839
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,110
I think you definitely brave,
but I think there's definitely a line

840
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:56,750
where bravery become stupid because the
risk outweighs the reward 100 percent,

841
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,670
100 percent.
It's a masculine thing in a lot of ways

842
00:35:59,671 --> 00:36:03,030
because it's testosterone makes you do
really stupid shit.

843
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,291
Like why?
Well,

844
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:07,170
they're all competing against each other
and the trend out macho each other.

845
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,870
I mean you could go,
there's a bunch of twitter accounts so

846
00:36:09,871 --> 00:36:12,180
you can go and see what's that one?
Hold this beer

847
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:19,060
is a twitter account called hold my beer
while was exactly why I do everything.

848
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,700
It's like people jumping off roofs and
stupid shit and it's almost all men.

849
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,780
There's occasionally a drunk girl doing
something stupid,

850
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:32,040
but it's almost entirely men,
so I would think that men trying to out

851
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,240
macho each other

852
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,140
somewhat inferior then because they do a
lot of dumb stuff.

853
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,540
Maybe their hormones are not in balance
like ours.

854
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,400
They definitely,
when competing against each other,

855
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,140
we'll do dumb shit and they trust around
drones to blame.

856
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,670
Will they try that out?
Macho each other?

857
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,860
Yeah.
I mean some don't.

858
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,370
Some are smart and they don't,
but you know,

859
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,360
there's just a part of being a man.
It's like trying to prove that you're

860
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:00,790
not scared as part of being a man.
Tell me about men.

861
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:01,903
What you want to know

862
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,893
now.
What else is.

863
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,950
What else is a very manly that women
don't understand?

864
00:37:07,951 --> 00:37:08,784
What,
what,

865
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,591
what,
what,

866
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:11,160
what don't women understand about men?

867
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,820
That's a good question.
I have no idea what you understand about

868
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,960
us.
Maybe just speak from experience.

869
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,040
Yeah,
but I don't.

870
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,480
I don't know what.
Like if we ask a guy like what's wrong,

871
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,670
see that's nonsense.
Talk.

872
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,230
Many girls out there like,
honey,

873
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,580
what's wrong?
What's wrong?

874
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:34,130
And you're like nothing.
Sometimes it's not really.

875
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,530
Is it really nothing?
No.

876
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,400
Sometimes you just want me to like,
decompress.

877
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,630
Yeah.
Sometimes it just wound up that annoying

878
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,250
when a girl does.
That depends on the girl,

879
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,480
you know?
What do you mean?

880
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,190
It depends on the girl.
If she's annoying,

881
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:47,120
yeah,
it's annoying.

882
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:49,370
But if you're in love with her and she's
awesome,

883
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,190
she can know nothing.
We're good.

884
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,620
Yeah.
It depends on the right one.

885
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,900
Oh,
100 percent.

886
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,550
That's 100 percent.
Yeah.

887
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,600
If someone's asking you questions and
you're getting really fucking annoyed,

888
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,720
it's probably not the question.
It's probably more the person.

889
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,140
If you think someone's amazing and they
ask you something stupid,

890
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:10,880
you'll just laugh.
You won't get annoyed.

891
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,820
And you guys could both joke around
about how stupid it was.

892
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,070
How the question was dumb.
That's good.

893
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,460
If you get angry,
it's most likely you're just like

894
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,873
annoyed anyway.

895
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,250
Yeah.
So you're just like ready to ready to

896
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,250
ready to sort of fall over that annoying
and to get out,

897
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,180
get out of my space.
Kind of a attitude because you're

898
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,790
already annoyed with them anyway.
You're already don't really like them.

899
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,590
Yeah.
There's probably something that's

900
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:36,700
already rubbing you the wrong way and
you're tolerating each other instead of

901
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:39,070
enjoying each other.
Yeah,

902
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:40,780
I mean I would imagine a person like
you,

903
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,800
a very intense person,
you probably have a difficult time

904
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,790
finding,
you know,

905
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:50,410
like if you got a square peg in a square
hole and everything slides in together.

906
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,940
Perfect.
And everything's amazing.

907
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,540
Personality wise.
Behavior wise,

908
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,640
I would imagine with something like you
look,

909
00:38:57,641 --> 00:39:00,730
it's a very particular.
You have to find someone who appreciates

910
00:39:00,731 --> 00:39:03,130
your intensity,
right?

911
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,900
Like a lot of times guys are,
they want a demure,

912
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,460
you know,
sort of docile little creature like

913
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,770
me home.
Well the suburbs on the table here when

914
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:20,020
you get back,
right?

915
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:22,040
And meanwhile,
you're out there with a fucking gold car

916
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:27,041
going 150 miles an hour in the driveway
that's running five businesses.

917
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:28,101
Yeah.
Yeah.

918
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:29,530
You're going 200.
Yeah.

919
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,730
So if you're saying what's wrong,
the guys are fucking nothing.

920
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,760
Probably a bunch of other shit that's
really wrong.

921
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,700
It's very insightful.
All right.

922
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,520
So what,
what don't men understand about women?

923
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,290
Um,
she's tapping her fingers,

924
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,000
going through everything.

925
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,180
I mean,
I just think that we'd like to be,

926
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,690
you know,
we like to be told what you're thinking.

927
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,540
I do.
I like to know what someone's thinking,

928
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,020
you know,
the whole,

929
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,210
like we're just,
you know,

930
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,760
just keeping to myself like,
tell me about it.

931
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,560
Now I want to know what your self is
thinking about.

932
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:09,110
I want to know about you,
what's going through your head,

933
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,400
like communication

934
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,060
now,
this universal amongst all your

935
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,920
girlfriends when you get together and
talk about.

936
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,880
I would think so.
Yeah.

937
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,550
Yeah.
So the problem is like,

938
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:21,290
you look at a guy and say,
you know,

939
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,590
really liked this guy and you're like,
this fucking dude.

940
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,720
Some crazy mystery like what's going on
in your head,

941
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,411
man?
Yeah,

942
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:27,640
that's not good,
but it out.

943
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,920
Everyone wants to know where they stand
and what someone's thinking.

944
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,410
Oh,
where they stand and where they stand on

945
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:34,630
what they're thinking.
Because you know what if the thing about

946
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:35,464
someone else.

947
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,700
Oh,
so you need to know.

948
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,410
Yeah.
You just didn't know if you're all in.

949
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,280
Yeah,
100 percent.

950
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,030
I'm just all in person.
So for me it's not a mystery like you

951
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:46,560
wanna know what's going on in my head.
I'll tell you right now.

952
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,530
That's intense.
Yeah.

953
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,310
Yeah.
So yeah,

954
00:40:50,311 --> 00:40:52,920
for guys like off drifting,
you automatically assume this one,

955
00:40:52,921 --> 00:40:55,200
the fockers thinking about somebody else
now,

956
00:40:55,201 --> 00:40:56,034
what are you up to?

957
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,940
Exactly.
That's what you're thinking.

958
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,350
Yeah,
yeah,

959
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,970
exactly.
You want to be able to ask.

960
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,590
I guess guys probably do that too,
to hear nice things to girls like to

961
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:07,041
hear,
you know,

962
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,360
girls like to be,
you know,

963
00:41:08,361 --> 00:41:13,361
girls like course to.
He would be appreciated just like a guy

964
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:13,971
does.
I mean,

965
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,190
I think that's my advice most of the
time in relationships.

966
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:18,620
I'm like,
sympathy goes a really long way because

967
00:41:18,621 --> 00:41:22,280
I know it goes a long way with me no
matter what facet of my life it is,

968
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,380
but you know,
sympathy goes a long way.

969
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,960
So you know,
if your husband's in a bad mood,

970
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:29,540
then why don't you just actually start
off with instead of feeling like you're

971
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,280
under appreciated going,
hey baby,

972
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,160
look like you've had a really long day
and I'm sure been working your butt off.

973
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,570
Like what can I,
can I make you dinner?

974
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,890
Like what do you want?
What's your favorite?

975
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,090
You know?
And they'll probably go,

976
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,730
oh,
you know what is not that not that big

977
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,280
of a deal.
You know,

978
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,961
Babe,
I'm fine.

979
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:43,190
Hey,
let me take you out to dinner.

980
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,220
I get to eat.
The sympathy gets sympathy back and you

981
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,440
don't,
it's not,

982
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,180
it's not good to do it to get it
necessarily,

983
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:52,340
but you should really feel like you are
sympathetic.

984
00:41:52,341 --> 00:41:55,010
Like if they're in a bad place,
try and help him.

985
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,800
That's sound advice.
Yeah,

986
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,950
just sympathy.
Just be nice because most people go

987
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,520
under appreciate,
especially in a relationship.

988
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,430
I think the longer it goes,
there's a lot of under appreciation and

989
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,200
assumptions that get made about who does
what and checks that box off and

990
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,950
probably especially with kids right
amounts out here with kids it gets way

991
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:13,710
worse.

992
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,070
It's just there's a lot of time that's
involved with taking care of those

993
00:42:17,071 --> 00:42:20,160
little suckers.
You gotta pay attention to them and talk

994
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:22,530
to them and they.
And if you have more than one,

995
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,090
like once you start talking to one,
the other one wants to just chime in and

996
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,320
show you what they're doing.

997
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,770
Sure.
You don't die now.

998
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,830
I gotta deal with this.

999
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1000
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:37,820
I think people get used to things,
you know,

1001
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,910
and that's part of the problem.
So they get used to each other for

1002
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,560
granted.
They do.

1003
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:44,480
And then.
And then you know,

1004
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:49,500
it's like I always tell people,
aspire to be the person you pretend to

1005
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:53,840
be when you're trying to get laid.
If you could be that person all the

1006
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:56,030
time,
you will have a much better life.

1007
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,000
I also love the expression for every hot
chick,

1008
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:00,200
there's the dude's sickest groner

1009
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,360
yeah.
I don't say it that way,

1010
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,140
but yes,
I use more flavorful language,

1011
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,920
but yeah.

1012
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,140
Is that,
was that too much or too little?

1013
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:10,970
Too Little?
How would you say it?

1014
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,140
Uh,
for every hot chick,

1015
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:14,890
there's a guy somewhere that's tired of
fucking honor.

1016
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:19,140
Sorry you'd say it,
but yeah,

1017
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:21,570
I mean I guess,
but that's not entirely true either.

1018
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,820
I mean it's for the most part,
a lot of the times it's true,

1019
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,760
but a lot of the times people don't
appreciate or circumstance.

1020
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,430
Exactly.
And then it's with various aspects of

1021
00:43:32,431 --> 00:43:33,600
your life.
Like I always feel like that,

1022
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:36,780
like I just got over the flu a week and
a half ago.

1023
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:40,410
I had the flu and I was sick for like
two days and then when I was sick I was

1024
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:41,244
thinking,
man,

1025
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:46,490
I don't appreciate how good I feel when
I'm healthy because here I am line here,

1026
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,160
akin watching Netflix,
feeling like shit going,

1027
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,760
wow.
When I'm healthy and I'm working out and

1028
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:57,770
I'm running and doing Jujitsu and all
the activities and I got all this energy

1029
00:43:58,501 --> 00:44:01,680
and I feel great.
Like I just can't do anything right now.

1030
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,820
I just take it for granted.
You forget,

1031
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:07,170
like you don't feel the joy of just
being healthy.

1032
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,620
It just escapes us.
We just so think it's normal

1033
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,860
taken for granted.
Yup.

1034
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:15,390
Yup.
Now,

1035
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:20,391
do you think that you're stepping away
from race car driving when you deciding

1036
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,880
it's just like enough is enough.
Do you think that in some ways that this

1037
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:30,440
is you appreciating other aspects of
life too,

1038
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,883
that you're,
you're,

1039
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:32,130
you're

1040
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,810
looking at your racing thing and you're
like,

1041
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,430
you know what,
I did a lot,

1042
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,780
I did enough and then why don't I just
appreciate all the other stuff?

1043
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,800
Well,
I think that's a good question that will

1044
00:44:41,801 --> 00:44:43,610
lead me into a good thought.
Like,

1045
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,220
um,
I think it's actually more me being

1046
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:52,030
honest.
Like I think everyone would expect since

1047
00:44:52,031 --> 00:44:56,290
I do what I do at the level that I do it
at the racing is my only thing I care

1048
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:57,220
about.
I love it so much.

1049
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:00,430
I'll do anything I drive every day.
And the truth is no.

1050
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,140
I like racing,
but I don't.

1051
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,320
There's a lot of things I don't really
like about it too and I'm grateful for

1052
00:45:05,321 --> 00:45:06,280
everything.
It's given me,

1053
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:10,330
but if you were to ask me what I do
outside of racing and my personal life,

1054
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,880
I don't go to the racetrack.
I don't really watch races.

1055
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:14,530
I don't,
don't do that.

1056
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:17,380
So those aren't my hobbies.
Like your hobbies or your real loves.

1057
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,210
What do you not like about it?

1058
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,440
Um,
well I would say that in the last year.

1059
00:45:24,441 --> 00:45:25,940
So the,
just the,

1060
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,030
as far as an energetic space,
it's just so sad and negative at times.

1061
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,100
A lot of the time.
And even in just racing in general,

1062
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:37,730
most of the time it's miserable.
Like you have some days that are good,

1063
00:45:37,731 --> 00:45:40,400
but most of the time it's not happy and
you wish there was,

1064
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,030
you're,
you're,

1065
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:41,870
you're,
you're,

1066
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,220
um,
you're not satisfied.

1067
00:45:43,221 --> 00:45:46,260
You wish somebody would have treated you
better out there.

1068
00:45:46,261 --> 00:45:47,900
You,
there's so many things to be negative

1069
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:50,950
about and just the grind of it.
Um,

1070
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,440
it's the people like everybody's worn
out and you know,

1071
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,540
you have to be really careful about the
people that are around you because they

1072
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:02,870
got to be in a good mood because it's
easy to spiral out of control because

1073
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:05,270
you see each other for three,
four days a week,

1074
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:06,980
every week for 40 weeks a year.

1075
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,730
So,
you know,

1076
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,010
you got to be in a good space with
people,

1077
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:13,670
but it still doesn't alienate you
completely even if you're in a good

1078
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:15,950
space that people,
the ones next to you because you got a

1079
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:19,580
car next to you on both sides and the
garage and hollers next to each other

1080
00:46:19,581 --> 00:46:22,640
and buses right next to each other and
you see a bunch of other people.

1081
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:23,700
So,
you know,

1082
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:24,700
it was just,
I don't know,

1083
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,780
there's a lot of negativity to some
degree.

1084
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,990
I'm a lot of grind.
It just kind of feels like the grind a

1085
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:33,830
little bit.
And so I just kind of felt like it

1086
00:46:33,831 --> 00:46:37,160
wasn't a space that I wanted to be in as
much anymore.

1087
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,830
Like I,
I want to be in a happy space where I'm

1088
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:43,400
just doing things that bring me joy and
um,

1089
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,790
yeah,
it just wasn't doing that as much or I

1090
00:46:46,791 --> 00:46:49,880
was noticing it,
I was noticing I was missing that or

1091
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:52,280
wanting it more.
I think that's really what it comes from

1092
00:46:52,281 --> 00:46:57,281
is growing as a person and realizing
I think everybody's afraid to take

1093
00:46:57,471 --> 00:47:00,560
chances and do something new in their
life because they're identified a

1094
00:47:00,561 --> 00:47:03,980
certain way or there'll be judged if
they don't do it or judged if they do

1095
00:47:03,981 --> 00:47:07,130
something different and who are they now
and are they crazy and what are they

1096
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:10,010
thinking and you know,
it's just life.

1097
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,690
Just do things that make you happy.

1098
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,090
It's interesting because you're talking
about this and the negative aspects of

1099
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:18,660
it is all interpersonal relationships
and so talking to people,

1100
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:22,260
you're not talking about that the grind
of racing itself,

1101
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,460
like the heat of being in the car and
the strain and the intensity and the

1102
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,750
nerves.
You're not talking.

1103
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,691
Yeah,
I didn't,

1104
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:30,190
I didn't,
not the first thing.

1105
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:32,680
I mean that is,
that exists on some level,

1106
00:47:32,681 --> 00:47:34,660
but I mean that's,
that's fine.

1107
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,520
I work out,
I work out twice a day,

1108
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:37,450
a lot of time,
a lot of times,

1109
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:40,450
so I'm okay with the whole physical
grind of things.

1110
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:41,284
Yeah.
Yeah.

1111
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,670
What do you do?
Crossfit and like interval running,

1112
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:46,930
training,
sprinting,

1113
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,240
um,
stuff like that.

1114
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:52,150
Circuits twice.
Volt stuff.

1115
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,860
Yeah,
a couple of days a week.

1116
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:56,020
I do twice a day.
Maybe more intensity.

1117
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,820
Yeah,
very intense for sure.

1118
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:58,401
Yeah,
that's,

1119
00:47:58,401 --> 00:47:59,234
that's,
that's,

1120
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,270
that's the name of the game and get it,
get in,

1121
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:02,840
get out.
Um,

1122
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,030
so,
uh,

1123
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,420
so yeah,
so I mean that,

1124
00:48:05,421 --> 00:48:07,780
that is part of it.
The physical part of racing exists and

1125
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:09,850
it is exhausting,
but I mean,

1126
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:12,190
you recover from that every weekend.
Um,

1127
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,090
but yeah,
it's,

1128
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,410
yeah,
it's just.

1129
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,960
And I just love so many other things.

1130
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,630
What are you going to do now?
Um,

1131
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,810
well,
the longest project I have is my wine.

1132
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:27,190
I bought the property in 2009,
planted a vineyard and it's finally for

1133
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,390
sale.
Um,

1134
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:29,470
so,
um,

1135
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,450
so it's called,
started in 2009.

1136
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:34,390
So nine years bought the property,
planted.

1137
00:48:34,391 --> 00:48:39,070
It started from nothing.
So it came from in 2006.

1138
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:42,970
I went to Napa Valley on a,
on a trip and was on this beautiful

1139
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,630
property and it's like looking at the
fog and the valley and it was wonderful

1140
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,110
Keesha's and fruits for breakfast and
this amazing white wine.

1141
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:50,891
And I was like,
man,

1142
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:53,770
it'd be so cool if I could have
something like this some day,

1143
00:48:53,771 --> 00:48:57,730
but I don't have $50,000,000,
at least not right now anyway.

1144
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,400
And um,
because I never abandoned the thought

1145
00:49:00,401 --> 00:49:01,880
that I would be able to afford that
someday.

1146
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,580
I just didn't,
I couldn't then.

1147
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,990
Um,
so anyway,

1148
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,250
I just started the process a different
way.

1149
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,980
I didn't buy a wine that was built and
established with the vineyard.

1150
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:11,500
I bought dirt,
planted the vineyard.

1151
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,160
You go about doing that.
Do you do hire someone?

1152
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,350
Uh,
well that,

1153
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:21,340
that day I met a winemaker who ended up
going into consulting instead of just

1154
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:24,730
being at one winery and um,
so he actually helped me pick the

1155
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:25,790
property.
Um,

1156
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,490
he's still my winemaker today.
So you bought this piece of land and

1157
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:33,070
then like,
who does the day to day stuff?

1158
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,240
You're so busy.
Yeah,

1159
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:35,420
I have a GM.
No.

1160
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:38,440
Um,
who handles all of it and does the

1161
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:41,010
promotion and gets it in restaurants and
you know,

1162
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,240
you know,
help sell it.

1163
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,770
What's it called?
Somnia them,

1164
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,250
which is a Latin world,
Latin word means dream.

1165
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:53,710
I was looking at some language
translations trying to come up with that

1166
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:57,220
was probably trying to come up with some
sort of an llc or something like that to

1167
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:58,690
cover the property up.

1168
00:49:58,690 --> 00:49:59,471
And I was like,
oh no,

1169
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:00,550
this is way too cool.
This is,

1170
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,800
what should the wine should be called?
Um,

1171
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:03,681
so Somnio,
I'm,

1172
00:50:03,681 --> 00:50:07,330
it's a Latin word.
And Are you doing red and white or just

1173
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,010
so ready to start?
Um,

1174
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:12,160
the only the vineyard is Cabernet,
cab franc,

1175
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:17,110
petite for doe and um,
so from the cab franc and petite or doe

1176
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,360
bleed off,
we're going to make a rose a this year.

1177
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,690
Um,
and then we also then source some grapes

1178
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,550
from Knight's Valley to make a 70 old
blank.

1179
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,900
Um,
so we,

1180
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,800
um,
we just decided it was going to come out

1181
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:31,940
in the spring along with the,
with the cab or early release and the

1182
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,620
um,
and the,

1183
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,510
and the rosy.
But it needed some time in barrel,

1184
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:39,170
so we're gonna wait a little longer and
put it in barrel.

1185
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,660
That's fascinating.
So that much take a shitload of your

1186
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:44,960
time and thinking as well.
Honestly,

1187
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:47,330
it's probably the least amount of my
time that company.

1188
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,110
But I would imagine if you have this
giant investment,

1189
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:53,700
you got the scholarship and investment.
Yeah.

1190
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,000
Do you have someone working for you?
They're growing grapes,

1191
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,750
two employees and um,
um,

1192
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,190
farmers that farm it not full.
I mean they farm many other properties

1193
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:03,570
but um,
but yeah.

1194
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,760
Were you affected at all by the crazy
fires?

1195
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,820
No,
actually I was really lucky that the

1196
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:12,750
Napa valley fires were.
I'm on Silverado trail side up.

1197
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,750
It's actually very,
very close to Howell Mountain

1198
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,530
Appalachian,
but it's um,

1199
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:19,140
like,
like 60 feet off of being home out in

1200
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:20,640
the Appalachians.
So anyway,

1201
00:51:20,641 --> 00:51:24,960
way down south on Silverado trail there
was fire and then straight across the

1202
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:27,990
valley.
Not too far laterally across,

1203
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:31,140
but it was all the way across the valley
was the fires on the other side.

1204
00:51:31,141 --> 00:51:34,050
So I was about as far away from it all
is I could get.

1205
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:36,020
And so I just talked to my winemaker,
um,

1206
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:39,600
a few days ago and he said that there's
really nothing,

1207
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,690
no residual from any of the fires or
anything.

1208
00:51:42,691 --> 00:51:44,760
So that's amazing.
Like with my wine anyway.

1209
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:45,520
So,

1210
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:48,280
so that whole area,
it's such a bummer that far was in the

1211
00:51:48,281 --> 00:51:49,740
same.
Oh my gosh,

1212
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:51,990
you said it was going,
I forget the exact number,

1213
00:51:51,991 --> 00:51:55,890
but it was something insane.
Like it was going a football field

1214
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,860
distance in three seconds,
like at its peak.

1215
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,040
I know that the big,
I think the big reason was the wind came

1216
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,590
in that night,
like 40 plus mile an hour winds came

1217
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:06,570
through that night.
Very,

1218
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,250
very,
very devastating for some.

1219
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:09,900
Um,
but that's one company.

1220
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,990
The clothing line is called warrior.
Um,

1221
00:52:12,991 --> 00:52:16,140
so that came out a year ago,
January of last year of [inaudible] 17

1222
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,100
warrior.
Uh,

1223
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:20,183
when

1224
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,650
is it like affliction,
like skulls and swords and shit?

1225
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:23,603
No,

1226
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,470
doesn't worry.
Your jacket I have on.

1227
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,850
It's very nice.
Lovely.

1228
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,670
No,
it's more athleisure.

1229
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,760
Um,
so leisure,

1230
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,590
have you never heard of that?
No.

1231
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,940
Oh yeah,
that's a whole.

1232
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,240
Yeah,
there you go.

1233
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,820
Thanks.
I'm a 17 year old.

1234
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,641
Um,
it's,

1235
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:42,120
yeah,
it's,

1236
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:46,620
it's like leggings and sports bras and
tee shirts and jackets and sweatshirts

1237
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:49,020
and athletes.
[inaudible].

1238
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,421
So,
uh,

1239
00:52:50,421 --> 00:52:52,000
I want to go back to this wine thing.
Oh,

1240
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:54,540
so you have this thought in your head
about some.

1241
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,290
Dang it.
Yeah.

1242
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:57,090
Well I'll go by.
So I'm telling me where I can get it.

1243
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:58,150
Can you get it anywhere else?

1244
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,480
Omnium wine.com.
It's not sold in very many places and

1245
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:02,550
mostly online.
It's not,

1246
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,050
there's not very much made so.

1247
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,420
Okay.
So you can order it online and you guys

1248
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,650
will ship it.
Okay.

1249
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:12,470
So now you get this piece of property
and you start talking to this guy who

1250
00:53:12,471 --> 00:53:15,200
was a consultant and you started talking
about making wine.

1251
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,250
Like what is the process like how does
it you have to buy the property and then

1252
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,280
how do you get the seeds?
How do you get the right grapes?

1253
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,090
How do you know?

1254
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:24,650
Well,
you have to go through a bunch of

1255
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,320
permitting.
Um,

1256
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,180
so permitting for a plans for it.
Uh,

1257
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,010
there's a certain grades that are not.
So if it's over 20 degrees grade,

1258
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,890
then you have to have special approvals,
but under you can plant.

1259
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:42,580
So I literally planted six acres ish of
Max,

1260
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,600
that's the Max that I could plant on my
24 acres that I have that was below 20

1261
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,930
degree grade.
And so,

1262
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,220
um,
so,

1263
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:52,350
uh,
you have to go through erosion control

1264
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:56,580
permitting because it's the slopes and
if you're going to dig up the ground,

1265
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:58,470
you don't want it to slide down the
mountain if it rains.

1266
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:03,471
So we had to kind of get creative with
some of the infrastructure to dissipate

1267
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:09,750
the water and so it didn't create just
rivers and rushing of new dirt sliding

1268
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,680
down the hill.
So,

1269
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,660
um,
because it's al at that elevation a

1270
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:13,790
little bit,
um,

1271
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,140
so,
um,

1272
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,150
and then you hire farmers and then the
winemaker helps pick out the root stock

1273
00:54:20,281 --> 00:54:24,450
and the clones and then they plan it and
you wait a couple of years for it to be

1274
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:26,520
ready and then the start making wine.

1275
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,410
So it starts with clones which stops.
Oh,

1276
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,960
rootstock and what does he graft on the
clone that they want?

1277
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,690
What's a rootstock?
So the actual route,

1278
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,740
yeah,
that would be.

1279
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:37,340
I,
I,

1280
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:41,180
I wish I knew every single thing that
you're asking to the nth degree,

1281
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:46,181
but I mean that would be like cabernet
petite rideau white wine,

1282
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,850
right?
Whatever.

1283
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,590
I'm sure that there,
when they did all this,

1284
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,670
I know I would want to see what that is.
That sounds fascinating.

1285
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,150
Tiny little tiny little roots,
but just send it

1286
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,560
trellising up and then you know,
then you get into,

1287
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,200
you know,
depending on your winemaker,

1288
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,240
they decide then how much fruit to drop.
I'm so sort of the vine comes up and

1289
00:55:08,391 --> 00:55:10,460
splits off and makes like a tea.
Um,

1290
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,560
and so they decide how many clusters
they keep on each side to determine,

1291
00:55:17,101 --> 00:55:18,410
you know,
what kind of wine you're making.

1292
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,680
So you know,
we drop a lot of fruit to make really

1293
00:55:21,681 --> 00:55:21,840
good

1294
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,360
wind.
What does that mean by drop fruit?

1295
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,240
Like you'd lose literally cut the cut
the cluster off of the vine.

1296
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,043
So you.
Yeah,

1297
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,780
that's why like if you're buying bulk
wine,

1298
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:34,570
it's,
they're not dropping a damn thing right?

1299
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,020
If you're buying grapes,
they're also not dropping a damn thing

1300
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,381
or.
Well,

1301
00:55:37,381 --> 00:55:39,400
not as much,
probably because they're,

1302
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:41,750
because they're there,
they're there,

1303
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:42,930
you're paying by the ton.

1304
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,560
So this is a long process.
It's a really long process to go nine

1305
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:51,190
years from the time you start to making
your first bottles.

1306
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,990
Probably why most people,
you know,

1307
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,350
I mean if you have enough money to build
a winery,

1308
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,200
you're probably a bit older and like you
run out of time.

1309
00:55:58,310 --> 00:55:59,690
Yeah,
yeah.

1310
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:00,770
I mean especially

1311
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,980
you're going to get any return on your
investment,

1312
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:04,720
you know,
I'm a lot of millions in the hole,

1313
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:05,380
but,
you know,

1314
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,490
whatever,
it's a passion project.

1315
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,760
Are you doing it as an investment?
Are you doing it because just you

1316
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,570
love it.
Um,

1317
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,310
and uh,
yeah,

1318
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,713
I can

1319
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,680
[inaudible] you can.
Yeah.

1320
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,400
Why not do what you can,
just money.

1321
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:20,330
Yeah.
And I love the lifestyle.

1322
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,130
So I want to share that with people that
are styled napa

1323
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,780
wine,
you know,

1324
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,360
the connection that you create,
you know,

1325
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,970
sitting down together and sharing it.
Um,

1326
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,850
the stories of the vineyard,
the story of how it came along.

1327
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:34,480
I mean,
I have,

1328
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,650
the good thing is,
is people were like,

1329
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:36,220
well,
you got up there.

1330
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,610
I'm like,
well,

1331
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,080
I have a story.
Um,

1332
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,640
but that's what people connect to.
So,

1333
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:40,691
um,
that's,

1334
00:56:40,691 --> 00:56:42,370
you know,
so then it's a matter of getting that

1335
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:45,520
story to the psalms in different
restaurants so that they can tell you

1336
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:47,530
the story of Somnio them and then you're
like,

1337
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:48,331
oh,
that sounds amazing.

1338
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:48,941
Oh,
that's hers.

1339
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:49,850
That's so cool.
Like,

1340
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,690
I would love it if my wine was a good
story that someone told,

1341
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:53,501
and then they were like,
oh,

1342
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,160
and this is actually Danica Patrick's
wine.

1343
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,230
And you're like,
oh,

1344
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:57,041
no way.
Yeah,

1345
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,270
I gotta try that.
You know what I mean?

1346
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:00,760
I'd rather have that be the backstory
than the front story.

1347
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,770
Do you know maynard teen and from tool
to know?

1348
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:04,890
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1349
00:57:04,891 --> 00:57:06,610
I've drank his wine before.
Could he?

1350
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,400
Could he see us?
Could you see us?

1351
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,050
I just.
Yes.

1352
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:12,240
Yes.
I have some in my fridge right now.

1353
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,410
Got It.
A long time ago.

1354
00:57:13,411 --> 00:57:16,560
Got it up in Jerome,
Jerome,

1355
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:19,440
Arizona.
He has a little cellar door in jerome.

1356
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,760
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1357
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,780
Yeah.
I've never met him.

1358
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:24,540
I tried to meet him,
but it didn't.

1359
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,630
He's actually in town I think.
Oh really?

1360
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:28,230
Yeah.
I think he's still here.

1361
00:57:28,231 --> 00:57:29,850
He was just.
He was here yesterday for sure.

1362
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:30,661
Yeah.
He sorts of.

1363
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:33,250
Some of his grapes from California I
think for SOM is whining.

1364
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:34,860
Yeah.
He did a similar thing,

1365
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:38,790
but he did it in Arizona.
He just bought this land and then

1366
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:41,940
develop it in Arizona,
but the red,

1367
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,070
I think the better read came from
California.

1368
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:46,230
Is that what?
He's a freak.

1369
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,200
He's a real crazy person.
In what way?

1370
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:51,240
Super Intelligent too.
Super,

1371
00:57:51,241 --> 00:57:52,800
super smart.
Too Smart.

1372
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,850
Too Smart to talk to.
Most people is just so out there and

1373
00:57:55,851 --> 00:58:00,851
it's an intense as well and maybe it's
something to do with the choices.

1374
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:03,870
So He.
I mean he's a lead singer,

1375
00:58:03,871 --> 00:58:06,880
three fucking bands and then says,
then let me,

1376
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,530
let me just start making my own wine.
Opened up a restaurant.

1377
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,400
Like he's just,
he can't do enough shit.

1378
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:14,150
He does Jujitsu all the time.
Can't do enough.

1379
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,270
Sure.
You guys know him.

1380
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:19,080
He was over here for Jujitsu to
seminars.

1381
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,890
John Danaher.
He was at one of his seminars yesterday.

1382
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,580
Yeah.
Now he's a maniac.

1383
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,160
Maybe make wine then.
I think so.

1384
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:27,540
Well,
I think it'd be weird.

1385
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:29,970
The normal.
I think that's a good way of looking at

1386
00:58:29,971 --> 00:58:31,520
things.
It's nothing wrong with being weird.

1387
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,500
Normally in conventional or the opposite
of weird.

1388
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:37,680
I looked it up.
I don't want to be either of those.

1389
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:39,750
Yeah,
well it depends,

1390
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:41,640
you know,
conventional wisdom is not bad.

1391
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,230
It said conventional.
There's,

1392
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:46,920
there's some normal.
That's not bad.

1393
00:58:46,970 --> 00:58:48,790
You know,
I like normal cheeseburgers,

1394
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,193
you know.

1395
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,310
I don't see.
I want caramelized onions.

1396
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:57,311
I want to Friday I want Maple Bacon,
pain in the ass.

1397
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,790
I love food.
I love food.

1398
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,340
I eat more than most everyone do you?
Yes.

1399
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:05,840
Yeah.
But your tiny.

1400
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,450
Well you put it away.
Well you work out twice a day.

1401
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,400
Some days.
I didn't work out today.

1402
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:12,470
It didn't work out.
It didn't work out to work out.

1403
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,530
But um,
yeah.

1404
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:16,130
Uh,
I do eat a lot.

1405
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,840
My sister and I both do.
We're both like

1406
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,100
110 pounds and

1407
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,550
we are both like five foot and we both
eat a ton,

1408
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,300
but we work where we do work out a
little hummingbirds.

1409
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,380
All that energy,
you're burning off pro burning calories

1410
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:36,230
constantly look at each other.
Like I would die without fat.

1411
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,190
I need a lot of fat in my diet.
Yeah.

1412
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,050
Um,
maynard open up a restaurant to an

1413
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:42,890
awesome.
Yeah,

1414
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:47,520
I know in Arizona.
So some sort of feature is wines

1415
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,413
and where,
uh,

1416
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,360
where in Arizona,
because I know jerome is pretty far from

1417
00:59:51,361 --> 00:59:52,080
like,
I mean I,

1418
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,550
my,
my place is in Scottsdale,

1419
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:55,230
so yeah,
he's out in the middle of nowhere.

1420
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,340
He's his vineyard probably jerome.
Yeah,

1421
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,810
I think it's in that area was on the top
of a mountain.

1422
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,390
I mean this is a,
this is a cool place to go if you're

1423
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:06,420
ever visiting Arizona.
Jerome is really interesting.

1424
01:00:06,421 --> 01:00:08,670
You kind of wind up this mountain,
you get up to the top.

1425
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:12,420
It's like supposedly all haunted and
it's very bizarre.

1426
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:13,643
But there's.
Yeah,

1427
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,470
I mean the last I knew it was a very
long time ago that I was there,

1428
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:20,330
but it,
he has a cool cellar door and there's

1429
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:22,590
some restaurants and whatnot and it's on
top of the mountain.

1430
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,080
Yeah,
that's,

1431
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:27,440
that's maynard.
That's the kind of thing he's into and

1432
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:32,441
he's very wise to about balancing out
the rockstar life versus like,

1433
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,040
that's one of the things that I think
was attractive to him about creating a

1434
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:37,874
wine.

1435
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:40,270
I'd say that's really important.
I mean I've,

1436
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,500
I think I've feel like I've figured out
in my life how much grounding I need to

1437
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:49,410
balance me out and it's not like it's
not just like everybody needs 50 slash

1438
01:00:49,411 --> 01:00:50,244
50,
you know,

1439
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,910
50 percent of the time walking around in
the woods and 50 percent of the time

1440
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:55,410
doing your shit.
It's,

1441
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:56,640
you know,
everybody's different.

1442
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:58,140
So for me it's like,
you know,

1443
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:03,410
maybe 20 percent of the time I need to
take a walk in nature or do a yoga class

1444
01:01:04,471 --> 01:01:07,350
or meditate or something like that.

1445
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,790
Yeah.
Do you feel like,

1446
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:13,380
do you need decompression time just from
the whole celebrity thing to being

1447
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:18,410
interviewed and media and people paying
attention to you want to take pictures

1448
01:01:18,451 --> 01:01:19,091
with you?
They'll just.

1449
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:21,120
The constant assault.

1450
01:01:23,810 --> 01:01:27,800
I don't feel it's exhausting because I'm
listening and I'm paying attention.

1451
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:30,800
I'm answering your questions honestly,
where I think most people can just go

1452
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:35,801
into autopilot mode and it's probably
not as mentally exhausting for them.

1453
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,270
I need,
for me,

1454
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:40,430
it's just being on,
you know what I mean?

1455
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,140
Right.
Like you just have to be on all the

1456
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:42,980
time,
you know?

1457
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,510
Um,
so the,

1458
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:46,730
the being on part is nice to get away
from.

1459
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,033
Yeah,
I was.

1460
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:52,480
So it's kind of answering the questions,
but it's really just a matter of having

1461
01:01:52,481 --> 01:01:53,370
to like,
you know,

1462
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:58,270
navigating life and people staring at
you or wanting something from you or

1463
01:01:58,271 --> 01:02:01,480
thinking they want something from you
just because you're trained because too

1464
01:02:01,481 --> 01:02:04,680
many people have wanted something from
you to,

1465
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,310
you know,
just the demands of the things that

1466
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:07,900
you're doing and running around.
I mean,

1467
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:12,320
I,
I'm on an airplane twice a week doing

1468
01:02:12,321 --> 01:02:13,154
stuff,
so it's.

1469
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,570
You just get exhausted from that.

1470
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,320
Yeah,
that's unhealthy either.

1471
01:02:16,321 --> 01:02:20,310
Right now.
Do you feel like you're going to step

1472
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,890
away from public life when you stop
racing?

1473
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:26,880
Do you gonna Fade into the problem?
We'll see.

1474
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:28,043
No,
I don't think so.

1475
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,950
No.
I'd love to have a cooking show,

1476
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,100
a cooking show.
I guess.

1477
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,630
I love cooking.
I'm a.

1478
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:35,200
I'm like,
what kind of stuff?

1479
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,420
Anything.
I'm not much of a baker though.

1480
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:41,980
That's because I'm a free spirit.
Baking's all down to a science.

1481
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,160
You're like measure everything.
It's got to be certain temperature and

1482
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,990
I'm one of those.
Just dump it in a bowl.

1483
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,540
Taste it.
Does it need more sugar?

1484
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,160
Does it need more acid as need be even
more rich with fat?

1485
01:02:51,161 --> 01:02:53,320
Does it need spice?
Doesn't need.

1486
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:54,213
What does it need?

1487
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:56,660
No.
Are you going off of books?

1488
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,350
Did you take classes?
Like how'd you.

1489
01:02:58,351 --> 01:02:59,184
How'd you learn how to cook?

1490
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,340
Well,
when I moved to England when I was 16,

1491
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:04,610
I live by myself eventually.
Why did you do that?

1492
01:03:04,611 --> 01:03:08,030
Why'd you move to England to race?
You were racing in England?

1493
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:09,820
Yeah,
I left high school and I was 16.

1494
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:12,350
I moved to England and then I lived
there for three years.

1495
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,020
How do you parents handle that?
I think my mom cried a lot.

1496
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,260
I couldn't imagine,
but they couldn't.

1497
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,840
Um,
you know,

1498
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:23,680
they also couldn't imagine me not having
the opportunities so they let me go when

1499
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:25,490
I left high school.
So it's a racing.

1500
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:28,760
Were you doing there the lowest level
open wheel racing.

1501
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:30,020
So what's that mean?
Open.

1502
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:33,350
We'll just means that the wheels are
exposed versus stock cars,

1503
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,010
which are Nascar.
I'm so open wheel wheels open.

1504
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,050
Um,
so there was no wings on the cars that I

1505
01:03:39,051 --> 01:03:40,400
was driving over there at that point in
time.

1506
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,360
So it was just,
you know,

1507
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:45,470
no wing open wheel cars.
So I was just starting my,

1508
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,170
starting my career really.
Cause from go carts,

1509
01:03:48,171 --> 01:03:50,040
I didn't want to be a professional
go-kart drivers.

1510
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,140
So I,
I was like,

1511
01:03:51,290 --> 01:03:53,960
I'll just get into cars as soon as I can
have this come up.

1512
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:59,180
Well,
I was 14 and I was at the Indianapolis

1513
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,410
Motor speedway and I went into a suite
and there was some British dude in there

1514
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:06,080
and so I started asking about cars and
again,

1515
01:04:06,081 --> 01:04:07,730
we're at the race track,
um,

1516
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:10,100
and this,
this family that he works for has a

1517
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:11,540
team,
has a race team,

1518
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,840
and so I guess I asked all the right
questions and I'm two years later when I

1519
01:04:17,211 --> 01:04:19,490
was 16,
they asked me and my dad to come back to

1520
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:23,360
indy and meet with them and talk about
going over to England and race and they

1521
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:26,960
said I could learn more in one year in
England than five years in America.

1522
01:04:26,961 --> 01:04:29,730
And it was not true at all.
But I did anyway.

1523
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,840
I'm English pretty please.
Crazy pompous.

1524
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,720
No,
I'm,

1525
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:37,940
I'm,
I might make England people from England

1526
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:39,890
mad,
but there's not many that I've liked.

1527
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,110
Yeah,
I love English.

1528
01:04:42,111 --> 01:04:44,500
People are the opposite.
They're wondering,

1529
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,420
maybe it was just my environment like
they,

1530
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:50,080
that no one,
no one kept in touch after I left and

1531
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:53,120
lived there for three years and no one
kept in touch with me at all.

1532
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:55,250
Maybe you were too intense for English
people.

1533
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:56,960
Well,
they also have like,

1534
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:59,330
like this is where you are in this,
where you stay.

1535
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,560
Yeah.
Well you're very like rigid class

1536
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:04,730
structure is there.
Oh yeah.

1537
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,140
I have friends that moved to California
from England and they are like,

1538
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,570
the people over here are so much more
optimistic about it

1539
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:12,950
and open minded.
Right?

1540
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:13,281
Like,
I mean,

1541
01:05:13,281 --> 01:05:15,620
just like bring you in and prove me
wrong.

1542
01:05:15,621 --> 01:05:17,980
Instead of like prove to me I got to be
your friend,

1543
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,800
you know,
of the European mentality.

1544
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,760
A little bit more guarded.

1545
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,260
Well also being a 16 year old girl
living there by yourself,

1546
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:27,910
not knowing anybody,
dad.

1547
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:28,893
That had to be

1548
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:32,280
really weird.
I grew a lot so I learned more there in

1549
01:05:32,281 --> 01:05:35,760
one year than five years in America from
a personal standpoint.

1550
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,370
See,
I went over there and I was very open

1551
01:05:38,371 --> 01:05:42,420
and
unguarded and would tell anyone

1552
01:05:42,421 --> 01:05:44,010
anything.
And you know,

1553
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:46,260
how that work out for it didn't work out
very well.

1554
01:05:46,261 --> 01:05:50,100
I got hurt a lot.
I hated men after that.

1555
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,990
Um,
and um,

1556
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,870
English accents now,
like when you at from men,

1557
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,793
I kind of obey

1558
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:57,720
little bit.
Little bit.

1559
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:58,880
Do a little bit.
Yeah,

1560
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,950
a little scarred.
Um,

1561
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,370
but,
uh,

1562
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,830
anyway,
I came home and my parents describe me

1563
01:06:03,831 --> 01:06:06,240
as very cold when I came home.
Very guarded,

1564
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,690
very cold.
Did you guys visit back and forth

1565
01:06:08,691 --> 01:06:11,990
between them?
Like twice a year and they would come

1566
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:15,520
over once or twice a year.
So it wasn't alienation.

1567
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:15,730
Yeah.

1568
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,990
Yes.
But they said you were cold when he got

1569
01:06:17,991 --> 01:06:18,824
back.
Yeah.

1570
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,760
You became hard.
Yup.

1571
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:22,370
Yeah.
Fuck that.

1572
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:23,443
I know

1573
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,630
one of the hardest things in life is
figuring out who you really are.

1574
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,170
Like what you really enjoy who you are
as a person,

1575
01:06:30,171 --> 01:06:34,010
what you stand for instead of what
cultures told you.

1576
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,280
What advice do you give someone that's
trying to do that?

1577
01:06:37,281 --> 01:06:38,051
Like,
I have a nephew,

1578
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:39,670
he's a great kid,
but he doesn't know what the fuck he

1579
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:41,470
wants to do was trying to figure it out.
Now.

1580
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,030
I mean the first quick couple of things
that you can do to identify what it is

1581
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:51,031
that you're interested in and you know,
something that's true to you as you

1582
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:53,710
know,
just what do you do for your hobbies?

1583
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,720
That's very insightful.
What do you enjoyed it?

1584
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:59,020
If you were by yourself,
there's a job for you.

1585
01:06:59,021 --> 01:07:01,720
I mean,
this isn't illegal here in California

1586
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:04,320
now was sorta.
So anyway,

1587
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,180
sort of legal.
It's like some guru farmer.

1588
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,320
Um,
and then also this is like an odd one,

1589
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:14,230
but look at the phone,
look at the pictures on your phone or

1590
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,990
look at the pictures that you post on
social media maybe or something like

1591
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,980
that.
But whatever you take pictures is also

1592
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:21,100
of pretty insightful for what you're
interested in.

1593
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,170
You're not taking pictures of stuff that
you don't care about that true to your

1594
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:29,260
phone.
What if you're all selfies or pictures

1595
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:33,520
like.
Well then I think your ego is very loud.

1596
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:36,670
Do you have any selfies on your phone?

1597
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:43,590
So the,
the only reason why I selfies for me

1598
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:47,710
are,
are so annoying.

1599
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:50,580
But Office Dick.
No,

1600
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:51,641
no,
no,

1601
01:07:51,641 --> 01:07:52,210
no,
no.

1602
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:55,110
But I.
The only way I do them as if I am kind

1603
01:07:55,111 --> 01:07:56,050
of promoting,
right.

1604
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:58,750
So for me it's a matter of promoting a
healthy lifestyle.

1605
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:02,710
So maybe it's me in the gym working out,
maybe it's something like that where I

1606
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:07,540
can be like post,
like whatever workout I did and perhaps

1607
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:11,010
what you could look like if you did
these workouts sorta,

1608
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:12,760
sorta.
Maybe better really.

1609
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:14,310
I mean,
um,

1610
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:15,080
so,
you know,

1611
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,680
those are why I would take a selfie or
if it's with someone you really like,

1612
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,630
you know,
you can take a picture with someone.

1613
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:21,760
That's something that I don't think
that.

1614
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:24,260
Does that count as a selfie if it's just
you want to do when someone else.

1615
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,010
No,
no,

1616
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,550
that's just being creative with how
you're getting a picture of you.

1617
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,391
Yeah.
So yeah,

1618
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:31,880
selfies.
The only time I do it really is as

1619
01:08:31,881 --> 01:08:35,930
pretty much just to promote either like
clothes I'm wearing for my clothing line

1620
01:08:35,931 --> 01:08:38,900
or like workout style stuff for my book.
But for me,

1621
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:40,220
I'm not like,
damn,

1622
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:42,370
my hair looks good today and you know,
I,

1623
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,311
I'm like,
oh,

1624
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:45,490
look at me and I say nothing.
You know,

1625
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,550
that's just
ego driven.

1626
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:54,640
I know as a woman who is very ambitious
and successful and powerful,

1627
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:01,150
what do you make of these social media
stars now that just do that?

1628
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:05,450
They just stick the butt out and take
pictures and a lot,

1629
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,230
a lot of that.
It's a weird thing.

1630
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,940
And always will.
Yeah.

1631
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:14,583
Uh,

1632
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:18,070
you probably deal with it more
emotionally yourself because it's a

1633
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:20,980
vicious circle where you want more,
so you have to keep doing more.

1634
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,990
You know what I mean?
You end up that,

1635
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,900
you end up in a place where you don't
know yourself anymore because you're

1636
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:29,140
doing it to fulfill someone else's wants
and desires more than yours.

1637
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,430
Yeah.
Right.

1638
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,180
Like going to the next level,
right?

1639
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:34,440
You have to keep your like,
oh,

1640
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,920
I wore this like super cute,
like leggings and a sports bra.

1641
01:09:37,921 --> 01:09:41,550
Now I got to wear a body suit and now
I'm wearing a thong and holy crap,

1642
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:42,300
you know,
like,

1643
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,150
look at me now I'm,

1644
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:45,590
yeah.
What do you do?

1645
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,340
What?
Yeah,

1646
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:48,680
who are you and after,
but somehow it's,

1647
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:53,910
it's oddly successful.
Some of them their pages of like 17

1648
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:54,550
million.

1649
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:55,580
Well,
whoa.

1650
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:56,883
Yeah,
whoa.

1651
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:57,491
I mean,
well,

1652
01:09:57,491 --> 01:09:58,810
what it said,
of course.

1653
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:02,080
Then it begs the question like,
what is your definition of success then?

1654
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,470
Because if you don't make money off 17
million followers,

1655
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:08,260
then what's the point?
I think they do though.

1656
01:10:08,261 --> 01:10:10,460
They do like sponsored posts and stuff
like that.

1657
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:12,280
I agree.
That's why again,

1658
01:10:12,281 --> 01:10:17,200
you have to go to the next level all the
time to get more people kind of feeds

1659
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,000
the ego is getting fed.

1660
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:23,830
But as a woman who's an attractive woman
who's also very ambitious,

1661
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,040
like you could have just been one of
those things,

1662
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,610
right?
Like you like

1663
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,090
when you see someone.
I mean man,

1664
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:36,210
I don't think men look at it this way
because I don't think there's a lot of

1665
01:10:36,211 --> 01:10:39,290
guys that like,
look at guys who just do like workout

1666
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,810
instagrams or something like that and
they get looked at this.

1667
01:10:42,010 --> 01:10:44,670
And how about use your brains protein
powder,

1668
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:49,560
but as a woman who,
you mean you're not falling back on your

1669
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:52,320
looks is what I'm trying to say.
It's like you have them but you,

1670
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:55,860
that's just a part of you.
You're obviously hyper ambitious on top

1671
01:10:55,861 --> 01:10:57,510
of that.
When you see someone who's just.

1672
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:01,500
Do you feel like they're wasting time or
do you feel like that's just them?

1673
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:05,140
I just feel like it's immaturity.
Yeah.

1674
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:09,240
I mean if that's your driving forces,
just your looks and you know,

1675
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:11,040
but there are some that have some
content,

1676
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:13,260
but you know,
and they can use it to drive a message.

1677
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,020
I mean,
there's some that I've noticed like that

1678
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,360
that really do have really positive
messages,

1679
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,510
spreading positivity,
spreading good things.

1680
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:24,630
But I'm promoting good things.
But um,

1681
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:27,690
for those who aren't,
then I just think it's a level of

1682
01:11:27,691 --> 01:11:31,350
immaturity and it's going to come to me.
I think it will come to bite them

1683
01:11:31,351 --> 01:11:35,790
eventually because it's.
Where does the road lead to?

1684
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:37,600
Yeah.
It's a short live success.

1685
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,610
Yeah.
Somebody said this once.

1686
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:43,960
It's a really great quote that beauty is
a short lived tyranny.

1687
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,450
Yeah.
You know,

1688
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,180
like kind of leads me to a little bit of
a c one similar like the,

1689
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,280
I'm not going to get it right,
exactly.

1690
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:59,640
But it's the uh,
the ego is impatient because it knows

1691
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:02,790
it's time is limited where the soul is
patient because it no one has knows it

1692
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:03,624
has forever.

1693
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,500
We should have memes on a strippers
instagram.

1694
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,540
Perfect.
Yeah,

1695
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:12,780
absolutely.
Kind of ego needs to be fed immediately.

1696
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:14,730
You know,
the ego wants something now and it's not

1697
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,010
thinking about the longterm or it's
true.

1698
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:18,810
No sole decisions are,
you know,

1699
01:12:18,811 --> 01:12:21,510
perhaps unrealized for sore for an
amount of time,

1700
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:24,060
but you know,
the truth will always come through.

1701
01:12:24,420 --> 01:12:26,730
And so if you're not living at
[inaudible],

1702
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,410
you're going to have a transition

1703
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:32,170
now when you make like a.
If you put like an instagram post up of

1704
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,030
workouts and stuff like that,
do you do that specifically because

1705
01:12:35,031 --> 01:12:36,290
you're trying to motivate people?

1706
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,000
Yeah,
because it does for me.

1707
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:41,180
I mean when I see somebody hot working
out and see a picture of them,

1708
01:12:41,181 --> 01:12:41,761
I'm like,
God,

1709
01:12:41,761 --> 01:12:44,420
it better get to the gym working out.
Oh,

1710
01:12:44,421 --> 01:12:46,160
maybe put that,
put that chocolate down.

1711
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:49,060
I agree.
I think that means people,

1712
01:12:49,061 --> 01:12:52,810
especially people in my line of work,
comedians love to mock things along

1713
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:56,020
those lines,
but I take inspiration off of a lot of

1714
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:56,740
people online.
Yeah.

1715
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,880
And,
and I,

1716
01:12:57,881 --> 01:12:59,110
you know,
my overwhelm,

1717
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,080
like overall what I hope for people too
is that,

1718
01:13:02,081 --> 01:13:03,200
um,
with um,

1719
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,570
with the book I wrote,
I,

1720
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,190
I just,
I really want people to find confidence

1721
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:12,940
in themselves and develop a healthier
relationship with food and exercise.

1722
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:15,040
And I think most people think of food as
a punishment,

1723
01:13:15,041 --> 01:13:15,521
right?
They're like,

1724
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,980
oh my God,
I'll just eat this terrible vegetable.

1725
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,920
Or they're like,
I have to work out the socks were

1726
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,030
working out,
can be fun.

1727
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:25,210
Working out can make you feel good.
Food can also make you feel good.

1728
01:13:25,211 --> 01:13:28,240
Food is medicine.
Food will make you not only feel good

1729
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:31,630
but be good and look better.
So,

1730
01:13:31,631 --> 01:13:32,410
um,
so,

1731
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:33,190
you know,
I,

1732
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:35,710
I really hope that in all of my
motivation,

1733
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:40,740
it drives people into a direction where
they feel good about it all.

1734
01:13:40,751 --> 01:13:41,470
And there's a,
there's,

1735
01:13:41,470 --> 01:13:44,650
there's more positivity around it.
Don't you feel like there's so much

1736
01:13:44,651 --> 01:13:47,470
negativity around eating healthy and
working out?

1737
01:13:47,471 --> 01:13:49,000
There's so many people that just hate
it.

1738
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,830
There's quite a bit of that,
but I think there's a lot of positivity

1739
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:56,420
around it too.
I think that people are recognizing more

1740
01:13:56,421 --> 01:14:01,421
and more today the benefits of eating
healthy in terms of like psychological

1741
01:14:01,701 --> 01:14:02,890
benefits,
like your.

1742
01:14:02,891 --> 01:14:05,270
Your mind works better,
physical benefits.

1743
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,810
You feel better about your choices.
You feel better about your momentum in

1744
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:09,381
life.
Like,

1745
01:14:09,381 --> 01:14:10,400
Hey,
I'm on the right path.

1746
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:11,950
I'm,
I'm eating healthy,

1747
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:14,710
I'm taking supplements.
I'm working out on a regular basis.

1748
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:18,690
My body feels have got more energy.
It's tuned in

1749
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,700
better.
I mean I remember when I cut out dairy

1750
01:14:20,701 --> 01:14:25,701
and gluten years ago and my energy level
finally was up and consistent where

1751
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,950
before it'd be like the random day where
you're like,

1752
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,720
man,
why am I so exhausted today?

1753
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:34,230
I'm just so tired.
I didn't have any of those days anymore.

1754
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:35,590
Yeah.

1755
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:40,590
When people eat a lot of refined
carbohydrates and then shift to a diet

1756
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:45,730
that has none of that stuff in it,
it's stunning the the effect that it has

1757
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,100
on your mid day.
I'd always tell people like if do you

1758
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:51,670
need a nap in the middle of the day?
If you're one of those people just try,

1759
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,330
cut out sugar,
cut out your refined carbohydrates and

1760
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:57,130
then watch what happens.
You will.

1761
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:58,600
You will have so much more energy during

1762
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,760
not a napper that's for sure.
Yeah.

1763
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,850
I mean maybe I like coffee,
but you one of those four hours of sleep

1764
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:04,600
at night.
People.

1765
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,370
Actually I can.
I don't need a lot.

1766
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:09,820
I wake up with the sunlight too,
so I'm one of those people and I wake up

1767
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:11,520
in the morning and like I see the light
going on.

1768
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:13,720
Like it's morning.
Is it morning?

1769
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,130
I'm so excited.
If it's morning,

1770
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:17,530
I'm ready.
I love the morning and I'm very chatty

1771
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:21,150
and I'm very like up and ready to go and
like comment.

1772
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,080
Yes,
I job.

1773
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:25,000
Are you awake?
You are now made coffee.

1774
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,430
Breakfast.
Let's go running.

1775
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:31,450
That's me.
I'm really annoyingly up and ready to go

1776
01:15:31,451 --> 01:15:33,460
and happy in the morning.
I love the morning.

1777
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:35,680
How are you at night though?
Sleepy.

1778
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:40,990
I'm okay.
But once I get horizontal at night,

1779
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:42,910
it's over.
Like I'm falling asleep.

1780
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,240
You have no insomnia?
No,

1781
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,220
no,
no.

1782
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,380
I don't think so.
No,

1783
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:49,570
I have before.
It's awful.

1784
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:50,980
Yeah,
that sucks.

1785
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:52,480
That's not good.
But I don't,

1786
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:53,320
I don't have it.
No,

1787
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:53,731
no,
no.

1788
01:15:53,731 --> 01:15:54,160
I,
I'm,

1789
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,680
I'm.
But once I lay down at night and I'm

1790
01:15:56,681 --> 01:15:57,080
tired

1791
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,400
now.
What kind of Diet do you follow?

1792
01:15:58,401 --> 01:16:00,970
Do you have a specific,
you said no gluten,

1793
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,830
no dairy,
dairy and then a couple of years ago,

1794
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:04,940
um,
I,

1795
01:16:04,941 --> 01:16:07,040
uh,
so I,

1796
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,440
uh,
I did an IVF treatment to freeze my eggs

1797
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:14,441
because I'm getting older and I drive
race cars and I can't do any of that

1798
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:15,351
stuff.
So I was like,

1799
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:17,300
look,
I'm going for the insurance policy here.

1800
01:16:17,301 --> 01:16:19,640
So they,
how do they get those out of there?

1801
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,190
Okay.
So he really want to know.

1802
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,170
It's a weird method.
Right?

1803
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:27,410
Alright.
So you have a ton of shots for like a

1804
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:29,750
month,
a ton of a ton of shots everyday you

1805
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:33,470
stick them in your stomach and you have
a ton of shots and so they dropped your

1806
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:38,530
estrogen down to nothing and then they
ramp it up and then it multiplies the

1807
01:16:38,781 --> 01:16:41,450
follicles.
Like the follicles are what grows the

1808
01:16:41,451 --> 01:16:44,480
egg.
So you go in after a while and you start

1809
01:16:44,481 --> 01:16:47,720
getting ultrasounds to see how many
follicles are growing on each side.

1810
01:16:47,721 --> 01:16:48,760
So,
um,

1811
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,900
anyway,
it was good for me.

1812
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:54,080
Um,
but that many grows and they want them

1813
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:58,040
each to get to like one bite,
basically almost an inch by an inch.

1814
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,990
Each of them.
And I mean I had like,

1815
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:02,140
I mean this is a lot of information,
but you know,

1816
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,980
20 to 30 on each side.
That's a shitload of real estate in my

1817
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:10,250
body.
It got very 30

1818
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,670
inches on each side of the.
Each ones.

1819
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,110
Yeah.
Like what?

1820
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,690
Did people think you were pregnant?
Yeah,

1821
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:16,730
you do.
You look like three months.

1822
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:19,590
I mean it was huge.
I was so uncomfortable filling all the

1823
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,560
eggs in there.
It's horrible.

1824
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,020
This is bobby.
You're number seven,

1825
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,780
Mike.
Uh,

1826
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:28,850
I come from a long line

1827
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:30,280
girl so I'm pretty sure they're all
girls.

1828
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,170
Um,
but uh,

1829
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,420
it's um,
so I did that and they,

1830
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,970
they,
you do this trigger drug thing and then

1831
01:17:36,971 --> 01:17:39,420
you know,
36 hours on the minute you go in and you

1832
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:43,780
retrieve it and what they do is they,
you get wheeled in the room is super

1833
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:48,940
humid and warm.
They don't look at it on Google and I'm

1834
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:54,000
so animal wild things in there.
So they put you in like they put you in

1835
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:59,710
like ski boots,
like toes get you and get you up and

1836
01:17:59,711 --> 01:18:02,020
ready.
And then some chick was like,

1837
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,240
okay,

1838
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,890
right,
I'm going to give you a little.

1839
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,211
Actually,
I'm like,

1840
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:06,080
girl,
you don't have to tell me.

1841
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,480
Just do it.
Like that was what I told her and I was

1842
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:11,960
asleep.
And they go in and every they go in with

1843
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:16,961
a needle and retrieve every one of them
one by one with a needle I think.

1844
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:20,300
Yeah,
they go in and puncture in through the,

1845
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:27,050
through it and retrieve the eggs.
Did you get sucked out of their 24,

1846
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,930
19,
19.

1847
01:18:29,931 --> 01:18:31,430
We're mature.
Okay.

1848
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,900
So 19 potential people.
How do you think you're going to make?

1849
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:39,540
Have you thought about it?
No,

1850
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:44,270
they say you need 20 to guarantee one.
So pretty much guaranteed one.

1851
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,030
Wow.
This is an insurance policy.

1852
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:50,360
It doesn't mean I can try a different
way if I wanted to,

1853
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:52,101
but anyway,
so.

1854
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:53,900
Okay.
Back to the back to the point like we

1855
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:56,810
just got way off track here,
but this is part of the story as to why

1856
01:18:56,811 --> 01:19:00,920
I decided to change my diet and my,
my workout and why I ended up writing a

1857
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:01,790
book,
um,

1858
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,280
was because I,
I gained like four pounds.

1859
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,840
Okay.
I'm just people I know.

1860
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,210
These people were like,
well who cares for pounds on my frame,

1861
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:12,110
five foot who I'm small little and you
know,

1862
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:13,160
for any girl out there,
you know,

1863
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:16,100
your genes only fit when you're exactly
the size that you are and then you gain

1864
01:19:16,101 --> 01:19:18,890
a couple pounds and they don't anymore.
I was just uncomfortable,

1865
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,500
just wasn't,
I just gained some weight and not

1866
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:23,420
anything really.
Well,

1867
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:24,410
it was,
it was,

1868
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:26,960
it was legit,
like I just gained some weight because

1869
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:29,630
of the hormones.
So it instantly also gave me some

1870
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:34,640
sympathy for people out there with
whether it's dudes and testosterone or

1871
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:39,641
women with pregnancy or you know,
I'm a menopause or whatever it is that

1872
01:19:40,311 --> 01:19:42,710
changes their hormones and sometimes you
just gained weight.

1873
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:43,610
I'm like,
Oh my God,

1874
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,320
this is,
this is real.

1875
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:50,090
This isn't just some excuse for getting
older and being lax about your diet or

1876
01:19:50,091 --> 01:19:50,870
your exercise.

1877
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,800
It really happens.
And so anyway,

1878
01:19:52,801 --> 01:19:54,920
so I decided to eat Paleo,
um,

1879
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,670
for like a week really.
I was going to do it for a week and I

1880
01:19:58,671 --> 01:19:59,430
did it,
um,

1881
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,430
and I never stopped.
So that was two years ago.

1882
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,610
And then,
um,

1883
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:06,980
I also started doing two a day workouts
because I wanted to change it up and

1884
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,140
sort of kick things up a notch.
But I also realized that I was out

1885
01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:11,910
taking my dogs for walks and I was like,
well,

1886
01:20:11,911 --> 01:20:14,580
if I'm walking them I might as well run
and do a workout too.

1887
01:20:14,581 --> 01:20:15,650
So,
you know,

1888
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:19,170
instead of mile and a half of walking
around the property,

1889
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:20,190
I would go for three.

1890
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,980
Wow.
So when you say you do two a days,

1891
01:20:22,981 --> 01:20:23,814
like how do you break it up?

1892
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:26,510
Um,
they're usually a little shorter,

1893
01:20:26,511 --> 01:20:31,090
like I would say somewhere between 20 to
40 minutes each and uh,

1894
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:33,740
one of them will be.
I do upper body,

1895
01:20:33,741 --> 01:20:37,790
lower body and an ab day and I just
rotate through those really.

1896
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,440
I just,
I'm,

1897
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:41,540
I keep rotating through those
[inaudible] look if you do,

1898
01:20:41,541 --> 01:20:44,270
if I do it right,
I'm so sore I can't do upper body again

1899
01:20:44,271 --> 01:20:47,930
for a few days so I just rotate through
those and then I supplement and if I

1900
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:52,490
have time I do interval running.
We're all like sprint for 30 seconds,

1901
01:20:52,491 --> 01:20:55,250
walk for 30 seconds and I'll do that for
20 minutes.

1902
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,270
And do you have someone train you or do
you do everything yourself?

1903
01:20:58,300 --> 01:20:59,320
No,
I do everything myself.

1904
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,760
I write,
I write,

1905
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,790
I love writing workouts.
I think it's the artistic side of me.

1906
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:08,791
I like the balance in the flow of like
creating something that has fluidity and

1907
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:11,300
make sense and there's good transitions
through movement.

1908
01:21:11,301 --> 01:21:12,180
So,
um,

1909
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,320
I mean I see your big rogue jim going
in,

1910
01:21:14,321 --> 01:21:14,950
so I,
uh,

1911
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:17,230
I'd be happy to program for you if you
want me to,

1912
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:20,050
but it's crossed crossfit style
workouts.

1913
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,020
Well,
I do a lot.

1914
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,820
Like I said,
I don't do crossfit,

1915
01:21:22,821 --> 01:21:26,060
but most of the stuff I do is
kettlebells dead lifts

1916
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:28,970
Chin ups.
Yeah.

1917
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,970
Too many.
I got a what's called an awful Golf

1918
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:33,800
Golfer's elbow.
Tell me about it.

1919
01:21:33,801 --> 01:21:36,260
My right elbow is feeling so sore for
like three days.

1920
01:21:36,261 --> 01:21:38,990
Is it right on?
It's like right on the side.

1921
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:43,010
It's like right here.
It just got to give a shout out to Kelly

1922
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:45,650
Starr it.
He hooked me up with this crazy protocol

1923
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:48,410
for healing up my tendonitis.
What is it?

1924
01:21:48,411 --> 01:21:49,530
Is it legal started?
Yeah,

1925
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:51,900
yeah,
yeah.

1926
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:54,140
It's mostly.
Do you know who he is?

1927
01:21:54,150 --> 01:21:56,750
He's the guy who wrote that book
becoming a supple Leopard.

1928
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:02,140
He's a real wizard when it comes to like
exercise physiology and understanding

1929
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:07,331
the body and his book's amazing.
New and improved modalities and he's.

1930
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:11,060
He gave me a bunch of different things,
but also a tool to scrape the area which

1931
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:13,050
is going to be like a blade,
like a,

1932
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,013
like a metal.

1933
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:17,330
Okay.
I've had that done before and topical

1934
01:22:17,331 --> 01:22:20,670
cbd oil,
which is a really good legal.

1935
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:21,561
Yes.
Yes.

1936
01:22:21,561 --> 01:22:23,480
CBD is illegal across the board.
Okay.

1937
01:22:23,490 --> 01:22:27,170
Non Non psychoactive,
but the FDA is trying to stop that.

1938
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,690
Of course.
Follow the money.

1939
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:29,810
Yeah.
This creeps.

1940
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,540
It's a good explanation for just about
everything.

1941
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,060
They tried to put it in the same
classification as heroin.

1942
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,260
Solaris.
Yeah.

1943
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,210
So stupid.
It's just a hundred percent

1944
01:22:38,350 --> 01:22:41,370
pharmaceutical drug companies,
institutions of decision making.

1945
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:43,220
Well,
it's just creepy.

1946
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:46,130
People with money that don't want to
lose money to cbd oil because it's so

1947
01:22:46,131 --> 01:22:50,600
much better for you and healthy and
natural and does the exact same page in

1948
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:55,550
how much the drug companies would lose
for gain if they started selling it

1949
01:22:55,790 --> 01:22:58,310
fucks just.
They want to monopolize it.

1950
01:22:58,311 --> 01:23:00,280
That's the problem.
Patents,

1951
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,630
they want to be able to patent things.
You know?

1952
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,500
That's.
But that's like we were talking about

1953
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:07,060
before about the things that are in the
Amazon.

1954
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:10,600
I mean that state.
There's so many different plants that

1955
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:13,960
can deal with so many different ailments
that people have.

1956
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:15,870
But then I.
Alaska.

1957
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,140
Yeah.
That's one of them.

1958
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:18,640
Sure.
Have you done it?

1959
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,590
I haven't,
but it's an interesting.

1960
01:23:21,190 --> 01:23:24,220
Have you done any psychedelics?
Not done drugs ever.

1961
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,330
No drugs,
no pot.

1962
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:27,310
Never know.
You scared?

1963
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,540
No,
I did.

1964
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,450
My Dad's scared the living daylights out
of me when I was a kid and he told me

1965
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:32,980
that if I ever.
He's like,

1966
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:36,100
you get tested for drugs and you fail.
You won't ever be a race car driver.

1967
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:37,660
You told me that about drinking and
driving to.

1968
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:39,070
If you,
if you lose your license,

1969
01:23:39,071 --> 01:23:42,040
you won't be able to race.
And then what are you going to be when

1970
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:46,210
you grow up?
Then he threatened me with dad remedial

1971
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,440
remedial jobs.
And um,

1972
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,380
yeah.
So he scared the living daylights out of

1973
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:52,300
me.
Truth be told you can lose your license

1974
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:53,530
still race.
Also,

1975
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:56,830
truth be told,
I didn't get drug tested until way

1976
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,550
later,
but we do get drug tests.

1977
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:02,430
You're running a drug farm.
Oh,

1978
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:04,590
well,
one you're wanting to drug farm.

1979
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:06,710
Well,
kind of I guess a drug farm lady.

1980
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:10,380
It's legal above 100 percent drug farm.
It's wonderful,

1981
01:24:10,381 --> 01:24:15,381
delicious taste in drugs.
It's her is fucked up on wine.

1982
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:16,740
And what is that?

1983
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:19,530
That's drug addicted to drinking,
alcoholism.

1984
01:24:20,170 --> 01:24:22,160
I mean there's a lot of other things
that you can do

1985
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,110
altering that aren't addictive,
right?

1986
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,650
You're running a plant based drug farm.
One hundred percent cash crops.

1987
01:24:28,980 --> 01:24:30,870
So are you doing.
You're a drug dealer.

1988
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,820
Well,
let's just go all the way.

1989
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,350
Well,
if I was going to do something,

1990
01:24:34,351 --> 01:24:35,580
what would be the first thing I would
do?

1991
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,180
Pot for sure.
Okay.

1992
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,610
Nice and light.
Real slow.

1993
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:41,490
Don't take much.
Does that mean don't take much,

1994
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,660
but just take a little bit.
You don't want to freak out like the.

1995
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:46,110
One of the major problems that people
have when they first started smoking

1996
01:24:46,111 --> 01:24:48,330
pot,
they'll take like two or three hits and

1997
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:50,730
you can take one one,
like that's it.

1998
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:52,230
Put it down,
right Jamie?

1999
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:53,610
Yeah.
Jamie will tell you,

2000
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,460
okay,
we'll hit walkaway.

2001
01:24:55,830 --> 01:24:57,200
Yeah,
don't fuck with edibles.

2002
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,100
Leave those alone.
Those,

2003
01:24:59,101 --> 01:25:00,810
those,
you need to build up to those things.

2004
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,510
Those are completely different
experience.

2005
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:05,820
Experienced users.
Well,

2006
01:25:05,821 --> 01:25:07,980
it's not just that even experienced
users,

2007
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,190
they don't recognize the fact that it's
a completely different psychoactive

2008
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:12,400
ingredient.
Yeah.

2009
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:15,090
When thc.
THC,

2010
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:17,070
no.
When it's processed by your liver

2011
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:21,030
produces 11 hydroxy metabolite,
which is four to five times more

2012
01:25:21,031 --> 01:25:23,520
psychoactive than thc.
It's way more potent.

2013
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,331
Well,
yeah.

2014
01:25:24,331 --> 01:25:27,860
Which is why people fall freak out when
they eat edibles and they just don't,

2015
01:25:27,861 --> 01:25:31,920
don't eat the whole Brownie.
No couple crumbs.

2016
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:35,730
And then don't even think about having
any more for at least two hours and let

2017
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:36,780
it settle in.
Let it

2018
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,940
give yourself time.
Don't freak out after 15,

2019
01:25:38,941 --> 01:25:40,680
20 minutes and be like,
it's not working.

2020
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:41,640
Right.
Don't do that.

2021
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,920
Sometimes when I'm drinking,
I'm like,

2022
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:45,840
sure man,
this is my third drink.

2023
01:25:45,841 --> 01:25:47,850
It just doesn't seem to be working.
And then I hit it harder.

2024
01:25:47,851 --> 01:25:48,570
And then,
um,

2025
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:52,680
I don't remember anything.
Brownout or blackout or drugs or do

2026
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:53,340
drugs.
Yeah.

2027
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:54,180
Actually,
one of the,

2028
01:25:54,181 --> 01:25:56,340
one of the first times I heard one of
your podcasts,

2029
01:25:56,341 --> 01:25:57,870
I think it was,
it was about dmt.

2030
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:01,930
Yeah,
that's the motherlode DMT is the

2031
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:04,490
psychoactive ingredient that's in
Iowasca,

2032
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:06,450
right.
It's the most potent stuff.

2033
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:09,360
That seems like a cleaner,
cleaner way to do it as opposed to

2034
01:26:09,361 --> 01:26:11,740
Iowasca where you throw up and shit.

2035
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:13,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

2036
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:16,610
It's definitely probably,
it's also quicker,

2037
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:18,380
you know,
like the worst,

2038
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,330
the longest.
It's going to take a sick 15 or 20

2039
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:22,910
minutes,
but there's some places that are doing

2040
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:25,520
it now where they're doing an
intravenously.

2041
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,840
So those trips are apparently,
that was how they did it in.

2042
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:33,590
There is a book called DMT,
the spirit molecule molecule by this Guy

2043
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:36,770
Dr Rick Strassman who did all these
studies out of the University of New

2044
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:41,770
Mexico and they were the first FDA
approved clinical studies and it was a

2045
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:43,870
group of people.
Yeah.

2046
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:44,704
Yeah.
He gets it.

2047
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,490
It's amazing.
It was amazing.

2048
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:47,880
But they didn't interview.
Yes.

2049
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:49,250
Intravenously.
Yeah.

2050
01:26:49,251 --> 01:26:52,550
And they were gone.
So for like 40 minutes,

2051
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,120
like pull them off into the office,
into the other dimension.

2052
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,530
I was gonna say so other dimension,
right.

2053
01:26:58,531 --> 01:27:00,870
This dream state is,
do you think is like a dream state?

2054
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:05,630
It's very similar because they believed
that your brain during heavy rem sleep

2055
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:08,960
also produces dmt.
May think that's because we all have it.

2056
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,780
We all have the empty.
Everybody has it.

2057
01:27:10,781 --> 01:27:13,270
Yeah.
Everybody has and everyone.

2058
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,410
Yes.
It's produced by your liver,

2059
01:27:15,411 --> 01:27:19,310
your lungs,
and now they know it's also produced at

2060
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:23,660
least in rats by your pineal gland,
which is literally your third eye.

2061
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,040
That's it.
Actually.

2062
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:28,160
Insert reptiles that actually has a
retina and a lens.

2063
01:27:28,390 --> 01:27:29,380
It's.
Yeah.

2064
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:30,080
Yeah,
it is.

2065
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,350
It is an.
I am always trying to decalcify my

2066
01:27:33,351 --> 01:27:34,070
opinion.
Glenn,

2067
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:36,710
is that real?
I get that from them.

2068
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:39,980
Crystal people in Sedona?
Yeah.

2069
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,550
They say it's like fluoride.
Fluoride is calcifying your pineal

2070
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:44,540
gland,
man.

2071
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:46,820
Like,
cool thing getting in there.

2072
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,210
How's it getting through my mouth and
throat?

2073
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:53,750
Are you sure?
Are you sure you are what you eat?

2074
01:27:54,090 --> 01:27:58,370
Sorta,
but are you what you drink wine?

2075
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:01,220
Yes.
Yes.

2076
01:28:01,221 --> 01:28:06,221
I get better with age.
I don't know if you're really.

2077
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:10,010
Your pineal gland actually gets
calcified by fluoride in drinking water.

2078
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:12,270
I.
That sounds like some hippie horseshit.

2079
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,840
It does sound hippie horse shit.
I'd like to see some scientific proof,

2080
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:17,430
but hey man,
with all the hippy shit,

2081
01:28:17,431 --> 01:28:19,110
there's not a lot of scientific proof
with it.

2082
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:19,800
No,
no.

2083
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,370
There's not a sense of knowing.
That's what it comes down to is a sense

2084
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:24,300
of knowing,
like,

2085
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:27,600
do you really feel like this is making
sense to you?

2086
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:31,350
Does it register or you're like,
I don't know why I believe this,

2087
01:28:31,351 --> 01:28:32,940
but I just do.
I don't even know where it came from.

2088
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:35,010
Yeah.
I don't know about that.

2089
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:38,550
I'd rather trust scientists.
I like science too.

2090
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,480
My sister and I went and saw Neil
degrasse Tyson in Indianapolis over the

2091
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:45,410
winter when it was called the radio
thing.

2092
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:49,170
It was called Dia an astrophysicist
reads the newspaper.

2093
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:54,180
Oh yeah,
so he like pulled articles and just

2094
01:28:54,181 --> 01:28:56,190
laughed about them basically.
That's cool.

2095
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,300
Pluto came up because he was part of the
people part of the group that sort of

2096
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:02,310
said the Pluto wasn't planet.
Yes.

2097
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:03,810
Yeah.
People get very upset with them.

2098
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:08,400
He also loved to point out how there'd
be something crazy and he'd be like,

2099
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,960
let me point out.
This is in the science section of the

2100
01:29:12,961 --> 01:29:15,990
newspaper.
Like as if like how did this make it to

2101
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,310
the science section?

2102
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,660
Right?
He's going to come on here sometime in

2103
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:26,340
February and they're going to.
He's going to talk to a guy who believes

2104
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:27,720
the earth is flat.
Oh,

2105
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:29,310
that guy made fun of that guy too.

2106
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:32,170
He's like,
let me show you a reflection of what it

2107
01:29:32,171 --> 01:29:33,850
looks like.
If the earth was flat,

2108
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:35,960
you know,
of course it's a shadow of a flat line

2109
01:29:35,961 --> 01:29:37,210
and it's like,
of course that's not true.

2110
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,470
Well,
of course it's not true,

2111
01:29:38,471 --> 01:29:41,830
but there's a lot of young people out
there today that believed the earth is

2112
01:29:41,831 --> 01:29:43,600
flat.
Do you believe the earth is flat?

2113
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:46,390
It's most certainly do not,
but I think it's.

2114
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:49,010
I mean,
do they not think we actually go into

2115
01:29:49,011 --> 01:29:51,780
outer space and they think that that's
fake too,

2116
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:54,530
but I think it's just a matter of.
I think we landed on the moon.

2117
01:29:55,210 --> 01:30:00,210
If there's anything that I think is one
of the more attractive conspiracy

2118
01:30:01,421 --> 01:30:03,880
theories,
it's the moon landing was because the

2119
01:30:03,881 --> 01:30:07,180
only time they did it was between 1969
and 1972.

2120
01:30:07,181 --> 01:30:09,730
They did seven missions,
six were successful,

2121
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:14,050
and that's the only time in human
history that people have been more than

2122
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:18,910
I think 400 miles above the earth's
surface.

2123
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:23,140
Everything else,
all the space shuttle missions,

2124
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:27,640
all of the space station missions,
all that stuff is inside 400 miles.

2125
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:33,120
The moon is like 260,000 miles there and
back and they've never even sent a

2126
01:30:33,731 --> 01:30:36,040
chicken in the space and had it come
back alive.

2127
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:40,240
They never sent anything in this space
other than people like into deep space

2128
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,910
passed the van.
Allen radiation belt packs the

2129
01:30:42,911 --> 01:30:45,700
magnetosphere.
I think most likely we went,

2130
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:50,590
but if there's ever a conspiracy theory
that's attractive to me it's that one

2131
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:54,280
because I just think it would be
fascinating if during the Nixon

2132
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:57,960
administration they really did fake it
and

2133
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:01,020
there's a lot of weirdness to it.
They fake it.

2134
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:02,820
Well,
first of all,

2135
01:31:02,821 --> 01:31:06,000
to show military superiority to the
Russians and again,

2136
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:08,100
I'm not saying,
and I used to believe they did fake it.

2137
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:10,410
I was.
I was heavily on the side that they

2138
01:31:10,411 --> 01:31:13,920
faked it,
but then I realized I don't know Jack

2139
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,910
Shit about astrophysics.
I don't know Jack Shit about rocket

2140
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:18,800
travel.
I don't.

2141
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:22,260
I mean I'm just talking out of my ass.
So like me saying that they didn't go

2142
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:26,280
was literally an ignorant perspective.
Just a guess.

2143
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:29,580
Well it was just being attracted to
conspiracy theories,

2144
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:33,360
which is fun.
That's the problem is that conspiracy

2145
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:36,930
theories are really fun.
It's really fun.

2146
01:31:36,931 --> 01:31:38,010
You have is,
are really fun.

2147
01:31:38,011 --> 01:31:38,844
All that stuff.

2148
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:42,680
A lot of stuff to get to the get to the
core because there's,

2149
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:44,360
there's,
there's arguments on both sides.

2150
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,180
There is,
but it's also you have to recognize in

2151
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:50,330
yourself that you do not want the
official story to be true.

2152
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,800
And I do not an almost every single
thing that happens like,

2153
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:57,740
you know,
Moon landing or Ufo landings were any

2154
01:31:57,741 --> 01:32:01,210
crazy shit.
I want the crazy shit to be real.

2155
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,330
I always want the UFO thing to be a real
thing.

2156
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:05,940
They do have it.
It's even aliens.

2157
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:10,240
Yes.
I think it's more than likely that

2158
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:11,074
there's something out

2159
01:32:12,050 --> 01:32:15,750
to feel like that.
We're the only thing in the universe.

2160
01:32:15,751 --> 01:32:17,490
It's a little ridiculous.
It seems stupid.

2161
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:19,620
It seems pretty ignorant and arrogant.

2162
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:23,120
Yeah,
but I don't think that it's what we

2163
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:28,121
think it is.
I think it's most likely far beyond the

2164
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:33,970
places that we can currently travel to
and I think that by the time they get to

2165
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:39,040
a high level of sophistication,
they're most likely not even organic

2166
01:32:39,231 --> 01:32:41,300
anymore.
And I think that that's the future of

2167
01:32:41,301 --> 01:32:43,280
the human race.
I those of consciousness.

2168
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:46,070
Well I think maybe that,
but I also think there's a real problem

2169
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:48,080
with the possibility of artificial
intelligence.

2170
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:52,250
I think human beings are about to create
life,

2171
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,480
whether we recognize it as life or not,
what artificial life is going to be his

2172
01:32:56,481 --> 01:32:58,850
life,
artificial intelligence is going to have

2173
01:32:58,851 --> 01:33:03,851
the ability to change itself,
multiply what human beings have been

2174
01:33:05,061 --> 01:33:10,061
able to do in terms of technological
innovation by a rate of something

2175
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:13,250
insane.
Like in two years they'll be able to do

2176
01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:18,310
10,000 years of innovation in terms of
like what we're capable of doing.

2177
01:33:19,070 --> 01:33:22,380
So I think that what we're looking at
now is the,

2178
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:27,380
the last days of biological life.
I think 100 years from now,

2179
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:29,120
500 years from now,
whatever it is,

2180
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:32,360
there won't be biological humans
anymore.

2181
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,970
I think this will be an archaic.

2182
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,720
David will change as we know it.
Yeah,

2183
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:39,160
and I think,
you know,

2184
01:33:39,630 --> 01:33:41,520
I don't believe in everything the Bible
says,

2185
01:33:41,521 --> 01:33:43,710
but you know,
was that in the Bible?

2186
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:46,030
Well,
so the apocalypse world will change as

2187
01:33:46,031 --> 01:33:48,240
we know it.
I think the apocalypse local end is,

2188
01:33:48,241 --> 01:33:49,200
we know it right.

2189
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,390
But I think the apocalypse,
like the stuff in the Bible,

2190
01:33:51,391 --> 01:33:53,160
that's all local.
Like if you,

2191
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:55,740
if you lived where Hurricane Katrina
hit,

2192
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,150
you would think the apocalypse was
there.

2193
01:33:57,330 --> 01:34:01,830
Right?
If you were in anywhere where something

2194
01:34:01,831 --> 01:34:05,100
really fucking crazy happened and you
didn't have any contact with the outside

2195
01:34:05,101 --> 01:34:06,210
world.
No cell phones,

2196
01:34:06,211 --> 01:34:07,950
no radio,
no TV didn't exist.

2197
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:08,600
Right?

2198
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:09,830
True or isolated.

2199
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:11,410
Yeah.
I think that's what all of our,

2200
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:15,840
our notions of the apocalypse are there
periodic natural disasters that are

2201
01:34:15,841 --> 01:34:19,980
unbelievably devastating.
Like they've proven that the entire

2202
01:34:19,981 --> 01:34:24,390
human race was,
was down to a few thousand people

2203
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:27,420
because of a super volcano around 70,000
years ago.

2204
01:34:28,230 --> 01:34:32,280
So I think there's been a series of
those events throughout history where

2205
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:36,630
the human race is brought down to an a,
an almost unmanageable level,

2206
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:41,100
and then we repopulated and I think that
that's probably the origins of the

2207
01:34:41,101 --> 01:34:44,910
apocalypse or asteroidal impacts,
which are very common.

2208
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,480
They've happened all throughout history.

2209
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:50,540
I think that ai is going to just
eliminate biological humans.

2210
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:53,190
I think it's entirely possible that
we're going to get into it too,

2211
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,680
that we're going to take it.
We're going to first of all become

2212
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,670
symbiotic.
We're gonna take something and put it

2213
01:34:58,671 --> 01:35:01,400
inside of us.
It's going to enhance us was it's our

2214
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:05,420
ability to communicate whether it's our
ability to see we're going to start

2215
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:09,980
implanting chips into ourselves and then
they're going to have improved body

2216
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:11,690
parts.
Like say if you break your arm and

2217
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:12,710
you're like,
look Danica,

2218
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:15,740
we can fix your arm,
but it's going to take a year.

2219
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,920
You have 17 broken bones or we can
replace it with an arm that works better

2220
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:25,640
and it'll feel just like a regular arm.
And I'm going to bring in Mike and Mike

2221
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:28,420
has a fake arm and he's going to show
you how it works and Mike's going to

2222
01:35:28,421 --> 01:35:30,110
come in.
I'm so much happier with my arm.

2223
01:35:30,111 --> 01:35:30,944
Then I was my face

2224
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:34,240
with my real arm drug pushers.
Like,

2225
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:36,490
no,
this lookout works and it's a free

2226
01:35:36,491 --> 01:35:39,430
vacation to um,
if you do this.

2227
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,600
Uh,
I,

2228
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:43,730
I've watched some,
I heard some youtube video of like it

2229
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:48,380
was someone who channels other,
one of those aspects.

2230
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:52,540
I think it was channeling the Palladian
so probably totally legit.

2231
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:56,470
And she talked about how it was talking
about how as a,

2232
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,920
as a human race we have to be careful.
We don't alter ourselves too much

2233
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:02,630
because then we won't exist as a human
race because we won't be able to

2234
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:06,070
procreate.
And that is what keeps our race alive.

2235
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,950
That's probably true.
I mean if you think about where we're

2236
01:36:08,951 --> 01:36:11,620
going to go,
but also doesn't have to

2237
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:14,780
keep evolving.
I mean if we got back,

2238
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:17,420
look,
you think like monkeys when they were

2239
01:36:17,421 --> 01:36:18,810
living in trees thrown shit

2240
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:21,140
different than that.
Now we gotta be chill.

2241
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:23,290
Otherwise,
we're going to stop being monkeys who

2242
01:36:23,291 --> 01:36:27,830
will be able to throw shit at each other
and Dodge Jaguars bananas all day.

2243
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,580
Yeah,
I mean,

2244
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,700
I think people are afraid of change and
I think the human race is afraid of

2245
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:33,970
change too.
But we're by no means personal.

2246
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:35,450
People don't do things right.
They're all.

2247
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:38,900
Everyone's afraid of change.
Taking a chance of having it be

2248
01:36:38,901 --> 01:36:41,030
different.
Maybe it's worse.

2249
01:36:41,031 --> 01:36:42,680
Well,
maybe it's better,

2250
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:44,600
you know,
but that's like the hallmark of your

2251
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:48,110
whole life looking at 100 percent.
I'm not afraid of change.

2252
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,320
I'm not okay.
I have a moment.

2253
01:36:51,321 --> 01:36:54,290
I'll take the arm,
I have a moment of um,

2254
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:55,670
uh,
you know,

2255
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:57,770
fear of like,
Oh shit.

2256
01:36:57,980 --> 01:37:00,020
And then there's the next moment is,
well,

2257
01:37:00,021 --> 01:37:01,460
maybe it's better than I could ever
expect.

2258
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,740
What if they imagined

2259
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:05,700
they'll give you two options.
They give you one robot arm that you

2260
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:08,310
never have to work out.
It will always be strong.

2261
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:12,330
You can get that one or you can get one
that you constantly have to work out.

2262
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,020
Oh,
that's,

2263
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:15,620
I,
I would probably take the robot arm.

2264
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,900
But which,
which robot arm would you take?

2265
01:37:17,901 --> 01:37:20,690
The one that you constantly have to work
out now or would you take the one that's

2266
01:37:20,691 --> 01:37:22,840
just perfect?
Probably take the perfect one.

2267
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:24,740
Never have to exercise,
just Bam.

2268
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:28,190
Just jacked all the time.
If I wanted,

2269
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:31,310
I mean working out.
If I still needed to do that for like

2270
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:31,790
the,
you know,

2271
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,890
feel good endorphin hormone,
sort of,

2272
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,300
you know,
state,

2273
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:37,440
then I would still do that right here by
your brain.

2274
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,830
Just
from rush.

2275
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:44,000
Well yeah.
And I would go do a lot more stuff like

2276
01:37:44,001 --> 01:37:46,060
walking around in nature.
Mm.

2277
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:49,790
That's good answer because that's,
I mean I really find enjoyment out of

2278
01:37:49,791 --> 01:37:51,410
that.
I mean I find enjoyment out of the

2279
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:54,800
intensity level of things and the
confidence that I get or the,

2280
01:37:55,170 --> 01:37:58,980
you know,
being able to shift my mindset to this

2281
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:01,890
sort of like all go all in.

2282
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,260
Not no pain,
no gain.

2283
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:07,890
That's so cheesy.
But like I can endure and the confidence

2284
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:09,870
that comes from enduring and pushing
through.

2285
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,950
I enjoy that.
I enjoy that development of my mind and

2286
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:16,200
my discipline and my confidence.
I do,

2287
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:20,790
but I'm probably just shifting more into
enjoying,

2288
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:23,040
you know,
things that are a little more peaceful

2289
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:25,710
too,
so shifting more and to enjoy nature,

2290
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:29,970
but that would be the most fucked up
thing if I didn't enjoy nature anymore.

2291
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,090
They started replacing body parts and
you're like,

2292
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,100
you didn't give a shit about the forest.
Oh,

2293
01:38:34,110 --> 01:38:36,060
that would be sad.
I'll be sad.

2294
01:38:36,061 --> 01:38:39,240
I wouldn't take that body part then
probably wouldn't know until it's too

2295
01:38:39,241 --> 01:38:42,030
late.
Until they replace it.

2296
01:38:42,031 --> 01:38:43,920
Probably gonna be dead before all this
is real.

2297
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:44,830
So that's what I think

2298
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,250
those aliens are.
When people see Aliens,

2299
01:38:47,251 --> 01:38:49,390
those gray aliens.
Crazy guys.

2300
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:51,660
I think that's just what we're going to
become.

2301
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,450
That's what I think.
I've been thinking that a lot.

2302
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:59,310
I think it's natural if you look at what
a monkey is and then if we were at some

2303
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:02,160
point in time,
like some ancient hominid like Australia

2304
01:39:02,161 --> 01:39:04,620
pythagoreous or whatever,
Cro-magnon man,

2305
01:39:04,621 --> 01:39:07,350
and then we moved on to become
homosapien.

2306
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,250
If we keep going in that direction,
this is what we're going to look like.

2307
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:13,140
We're going to look like a little skinny
things with big heads

2308
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:15,330
lollipops.
Yeah.

2309
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:18,420
That's what I looked like when I had my
helmet on when I'm in my race suit.

2310
01:39:18,421 --> 01:39:21,120
People that are to alien.
That's a good point,

2311
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:23,730
right,
because you have a regular size helmet.

2312
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,780
That's right.
Yeah.

2313
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,210
I didn't even think of that.
Did your helmet.

2314
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:31,290
It's like that would be like a big guy
wearing an enormous helmet.

2315
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:32,770
Crazy.
Yeah.

2316
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:35,390
Do you have a strong narrative?
Must have a wicked neck.

2317
01:39:35,450 --> 01:39:37,680
I do.
Do you do exercises with it?

2318
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,990
I don't need to.
You don't just carrying the helmet

2319
01:39:39,991 --> 01:39:43,860
around all the time.
It's probably that and just looking up,

2320
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:46,380
looking up to my nine foot target for
wall balls.

2321
01:39:46,381 --> 01:39:47,700
I'm like,
oh my neck hurts.

2322
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:49,860
Yeah,
no,

2323
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:50,830
I just,
you know,

2324
01:39:50,830 --> 01:39:52,500
you're not out of the car,
out of the car that long.

2325
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:56,370
It might hurt a little bit when I get
back in an indy car again because the g

2326
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:57,210
forces are higher.

2327
01:39:57,210 --> 01:39:59,400
But you also lean your head against the
headrest.

2328
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:02,250
Usually the only thing that would make
me hurt my make my neck hurt a little

2329
01:40:02,251 --> 01:40:05,340
bit as road courses at the beginning of
the road of indycar season.

2330
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:08,190
What is it like to test?
Because acceleration and deceleration,

2331
01:40:08,191 --> 01:40:11,670
there's nothing to hold you from like
your neck going head going forward.

2332
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:13,740
I mean there is,
but not to the level that you would

2333
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,150
drive that way.
Um,

2334
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:18,570
there's just a device that is in case
you're in an accident but it still

2335
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:19,710
moves.
So you know,

2336
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:21,930
holding,
holding your neck forward and backwards

2337
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:25,350
is a lot more sore than side to side
just because you have a head rest.

2338
01:40:25,650 --> 01:40:26,430
So when you use it,

2339
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:29,220
get out of a long race.
Is your whole body tired?

2340
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,380
Yeah,
I mean in stock cars it's.

2341
01:40:31,381 --> 01:40:35,760
So it's really a lot about dehydration.
Dehydration.

2342
01:40:35,761 --> 01:40:36,371
Yeah.
I'm in the car.

2343
01:40:36,371 --> 01:40:38,340
It's like 100 and 3,040 degrees in
there.

2344
01:40:38,610 --> 01:40:40,720
No.
Do you have a tube and you start to

2345
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:42,300
camelback?
That goes through the front of my

2346
01:40:42,301 --> 01:40:44,010
helmet,
a couple of blowers,

2347
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:45,540
the back blower,
a helmet blower,

2348
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:49,590
things that are cooler air,
but I'm here to tell you it's still hard

2349
01:40:49,591 --> 01:40:50,940
to sell in there or did I imagine

2350
01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:54,070
there's a fire in a gigantic iron block

2351
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,640
in front of you when the water and oil
temperature is 300 degrees.

2352
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:58,990
Yeah.
Jesus.

2353
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:01,630
It's sort of a,
it's like a greenhouse in the car.

2354
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,760
It's right.
I runs right underneath you to.

2355
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:07,960
Do you think you're going to miss it?
That's a great question.

2356
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,520
I was talking about this just the other
day,

2357
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:11,200
like,
am I going to miss the intensity?

2358
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:12,970
Am I going to miss certain?
I mean,

2359
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,490
I don't know if I'll.
I think I will miss some of it a little

2360
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:16,840
bit.
Every now and again I'm driving down the

2361
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:19,090
road and I'm like,
I'll probably miss it a little bit.

2362
01:41:19,650 --> 01:41:21,540
But um,
but,

2363
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:23,620
uh,
yeah.

2364
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:26,760
Again,
I'm a decisive person so I'm good.

2365
01:41:27,270 --> 01:41:29,490
I'm sure you're good.
I'm just wondering more if I'm going to

2366
01:41:29,491 --> 01:41:34,350
miss the,
the intensity level of the job and the

2367
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:39,180
highs being so high,
but the lows being low.

2368
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:41,280
I mean that's the,
that's how you get the highest right.

2369
01:41:41,281 --> 01:41:43,920
And the duality of the,
of the environment.

2370
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:49,470
I'm wondering if I'll miss some of that
and if whatever I do on the side will be

2371
01:41:50,131 --> 01:41:53,720
enough.
What is the age that most people retire

2372
01:41:53,721 --> 01:41:55,700
from racing?
I'm 35.

2373
01:41:55,970 --> 01:42:00,290
I'm a slightly young.
I would say early forties after while

2374
01:42:00,291 --> 01:42:03,050
they just.
Their body just takes too much and

2375
01:42:03,051 --> 01:42:05,420
you're just exhausted.
I mean honestly like especially if it's

2376
01:42:05,421 --> 01:42:08,060
Nascar,
he was just exhausted.

2377
01:42:08,061 --> 01:42:10,190
I mean it's,
I mean that's my feeling anyway,

2378
01:42:10,191 --> 01:42:12,800
you know,
you're gone for 40 weeks a year on the

2379
01:42:12,801 --> 01:42:17,660
road and these really luxurious places
of the world on the barbecue world tour,

2380
01:42:17,661 --> 01:42:21,290
like grilling out of your bus and living
out of a bus for most of your life and

2381
01:42:21,660 --> 01:42:24,110
you know,
on the road in and out of airplanes

2382
01:42:25,310 --> 01:42:29,600
hours have nothing to do on the weekends
while you're sitting there.

2383
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:33,950
So just kind of the grind.
So I think he kind of just get a little

2384
01:42:33,951 --> 01:42:37,040
worn out and I could only imagine,
you know,

2385
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:39,440
I mean even like you were talking about
interviews and stuff like,

2386
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:42,350
yeah,
I enjoy doing interviews that aren't

2387
01:42:42,351 --> 01:42:45,110
based around how's your car this
weekend?

2388
01:42:45,111 --> 01:42:46,940
You know what I mean?
There's just so boring there really.

2389
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:49,850
Right.
So it's fun for me to talk about working

2390
01:42:49,851 --> 01:42:52,370
out or cooking or wine,
food,

2391
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,270
you know,
all that stuff.

2392
01:42:53,271 --> 01:42:55,310
It's just interesting.
Or aliens.

2393
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:02,090
I can only imagine the boring grind of a
media tour that you must have to go

2394
01:43:02,091 --> 01:43:03,380
through when you're raising all the
time.

2395
01:43:05,140 --> 01:43:07,700
Danica,
you were moving quite fast out there

2396
01:43:07,701 --> 01:43:11,000
today.
You have overperformance I was watching

2397
01:43:11,001 --> 01:43:12,380
the uh,
the uh,

2398
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,440
the old south park episode.
They had a bunch of Nascar drivers on

2399
01:43:15,441 --> 01:43:17,720
South Park and you know,
it was the,

2400
01:43:17,721 --> 01:43:19,130
it was when,
um,

2401
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:24,260
cartman's trying to be poor and stupid
so he could race Nascar.

2402
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:26,900
He was sponsored by badges cell.
He

2403
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:32,090
ate a ton of ads to make them as stupid
as he could.

2404
01:43:32,091 --> 01:43:33,710
And he realized that the more stupid he
got,

2405
01:43:33,711 --> 01:43:35,360
the more money spent,
some more in debt.

2406
01:43:35,361 --> 01:43:39,050
He got and that's how you got poor.
They just bought like jet skis and

2407
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:44,330
I think he says at one point in time,
Danica,

2408
01:43:44,331 --> 01:43:47,180
you're not having poor habits.
Poor and stupid as I am.

2409
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:48,141
Oh,
that's right.

2410
01:43:48,141 --> 01:43:49,520
You were in.
It was in it.

2411
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:52,080
Did you use your own?
No

2412
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,150
other stuff.
I was on the simpsons that year too and

2413
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:58,460
I did my voiceover for that,
but for,

2414
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:02,270
for south park now.
Did you love it was awesome.

2415
01:44:02,271 --> 01:44:03,840
I mean,
I don't care what they say.

2416
01:44:03,841 --> 01:44:05,510
If you're on a show,
it's flattering,

2417
01:44:05,511 --> 01:44:06,980
right?
They to make,

2418
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:10,520
to make tv in a different capacity means
you're being noticed.

2419
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:14,270
Especially South Park.
I think that's the funniest show that's

2420
01:44:14,271 --> 01:44:15,830
ever existed.
Yeah.

2421
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:19,340
Especially like all time.
If you look at all the episodes they've

2422
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:21,440
done.
I mean it doesn't even make sense how

2423
01:44:21,441 --> 01:44:23,730
creative they are.
That's what I was thinking is how

2424
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:29,110
they're just insightful ahead of things
a lot and definitely clever.

2425
01:44:30,110 --> 01:44:33,740
Like with their,
the delivery of it now they're wizards.

2426
01:44:34,530 --> 01:44:38,690
Just completely bizarre.
What kind of car do you drive in regular

2427
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:40,100
life?
Please don't feel like a prius.

2428
01:44:40,610 --> 01:44:42,440
Know if you like.
Oh,

2429
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:44,690
I just drove,
I was throwing some things into the

2430
01:44:44,691 --> 01:44:46,880
recycling bin and I'm like,
I'm just trying to do my part because

2431
01:44:46,881 --> 01:44:48,440
let's face it,
I burned fuel for living

2432
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:54,200
in terms of how much fossil fuel,
I wonder if he each chart how much

2433
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:57,050
fossil fuel,
the average person burns would not be

2434
01:44:57,051 --> 01:44:58,070
doing well on that.

2435
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:02,420
That would not be a,
I would not do well with the

2436
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:09,380
tree huggers are vegans of the world.
All the people loving animals like me,

2437
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:11,540
I'm all those people.
I love the forest.

2438
01:45:11,541 --> 01:45:14,450
I try and eat vegetables most of the
time.

2439
01:45:14,510 --> 01:45:15,760
Things like that.
But yeah,

2440
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:18,230
I also don't do my part when it comes to
my job.

2441
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:19,890
What kind of car do you drive?
A.

2442
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:24,800
So I've had cars for years through s
through the manufacturer.

2443
01:45:24,801 --> 01:45:27,200
So um,
this past year we were sponsored by

2444
01:45:27,201 --> 01:45:28,034
Ford,
so I had a,

2445
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:31,700
I had a ford expedition,
e l I didn't know it.

2446
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:34,770
He element it means extra long.
Oh

2447
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:37,850
yeah,
it was.

2448
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,920
Yeah,
they hook you up with a Mustang,

2449
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:43,520
shelby.
Well that's not very practical thing.

2450
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:47,360
We weren't even allowed to customize,
customize the wheels on that thing.

2451
01:45:47,361 --> 01:45:50,660
So yeah,
it was bare bare bones because that was

2452
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:51,530
part of the contract.

2453
01:45:53,120 --> 01:45:57,590
You get a car but you can't get anything
dressed up with the raptor.

2454
01:45:57,930 --> 01:46:02,260
So I could have had a raptor I guess,
but maybe like trucks aren't really me.

2455
01:46:02,370 --> 01:46:05,640
Whatever
better than the l

2456
01:46:07,660 --> 01:46:08,570
A.
Yeah.

2457
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,550
So.
And then I had a Tahoe and I drove for

2458
01:46:10,551 --> 01:46:13,490
Chevy before that I would think that you
would want something fast.

2459
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:15,500
Um,
so that I uh,

2460
01:46:15,501 --> 01:46:18,560
I bought my first car in the last car I
bought.

2461
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:23,750
Oh yeah.
Long time ago I bought a Mercedes ml 63

2462
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:25,760
amg.
It was like a suv,

2463
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:28,400
souped up suv.
That was a long time ago.

2464
01:46:28,470 --> 01:46:30,770
That was like 10 years ago.
Um,

2465
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:32,960
I uh,
I bought a range rover.

2466
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:38,000
So since then you've just been using
manufacturer across from the sponsors

2467
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,530
because they're free dollars and they're
not,

2468
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:41,810
you know,
whatever is free.

2469
01:46:41,811 --> 01:46:43,700
Is Free.
Is that like a part of the contract like

2470
01:46:43,701 --> 01:46:45,170
this,
the only car you're allowed to drive?

2471
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:47,770
I'm probably not,
but,

2472
01:46:49,070 --> 01:46:50,670
but that's the only drive in the
racetrack.

2473
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:52,870
Probably driving your.
Yeah,

2474
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,870
company car.
Probably good move.

2475
01:46:54,980 --> 01:46:56,910
Yeah.
But other drivers have other cars too.

2476
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:00,660
But do you think that once you retire
you will start like going,

2477
01:47:00,730 --> 01:47:01,670
God damn,
I'm gonna.

2478
01:47:01,690 --> 01:47:04,140
Need to get some car girl?
What?

2479
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:06,060
Nope,
sorry to disappoint you.

2480
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,220
Mean how'd you,
how'd you even say those words?

2481
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:15,890
Do you know who you are?
And I'm not in a race car driver woman.

2482
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,030
I don't even know how many cylinders are
in things.

2483
01:47:18,031 --> 01:47:18,930
I'm just,
I just drive.

2484
01:47:18,950 --> 01:47:21,810
I'm just good at that.
You don't know how many cylinders?

2485
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:26,820
I think we have eight.
That's so crazy.

2486
01:47:27,270 --> 01:47:30,300
I just lost so many fans.
How can you be such a good driver and

2487
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:32,270
not know anything about cars?
I don't need to.

2488
01:47:32,840 --> 01:47:34,620
That's a good way of looking at it.
I don't build it.

2489
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,390
I don't.
I didn't have to go to school for

2490
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:38,700
engineering.
I remember the beginning of our top 10

2491
01:47:38,701 --> 01:47:39,780
years old.
Ten years old.

2492
01:47:39,781 --> 01:47:41,430
I remember.
So uh,

2493
01:47:41,431 --> 01:47:42,264
yeah.
I just,

2494
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:46,140
I can drive them.
You need to do so one of those new

2495
01:47:46,141 --> 01:47:49,020
shelby gt,
500 700 horsepower.

2496
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:51,570
I ceased announced it.
Oh,

2497
01:47:51,571 --> 01:47:54,470
a shelby new one.
Not the GT.

2498
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:57,670
Not the GT.
500 or the tea.

2499
01:47:57,850 --> 01:47:59,540
That's pretty crazy.
Yeah.

2500
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,750
Shelby just put out a new Ma.
Well,

2501
01:48:01,751 --> 01:48:03,780
the problem with those four gts,
they're awesome.

2502
01:48:03,781 --> 01:48:07,270
But the paddle shifts.
You want a manual stick?

2503
01:48:07,330 --> 01:48:08,270
Yeah.
Alex stokes.

2504
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:09,930
Yeah.
It's more fun.

2505
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:12,540
It is.
It's just a more racy.

2506
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:15,090
It's just more fun.
And I have a Bronco,

2507
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:16,530
a 19,
77 bronco.

2508
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,740
They're driving.
That is stick.

2509
01:48:19,770 --> 01:48:21,540
It's like,
it's not that fast,

2510
01:48:21,541 --> 01:48:23,370
but it's just,
just feeds your testosterone.

2511
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:26,010
Mechanical,
mechanical feel.

2512
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:27,680
It's analog,
you know,

2513
01:48:27,770 --> 01:48:29,760
I just like my car to be good off the
line.

2514
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:32,820
I bought a Lamborghini along while back
and uh,

2515
01:48:32,890 --> 01:48:34,950
it didn't have a cup holder,
so I was like,

2516
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,740
well this is stupid.
It's not practical.

2517
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:43,560
So yeah.
So then I bought the Mercedes and that

2518
01:48:43,561 --> 01:48:45,600
had a couple older couple of cup
holders.

2519
01:48:45,601 --> 01:48:46,500
Yep.
So it was good,

2520
01:48:46,501 --> 01:48:47,550
but then it,
you know,

2521
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:50,730
technology evolved and it didn't have
Bluetooth to play my music.

2522
01:48:50,731 --> 01:48:53,610
So I was like,
well I'm not going to have to get rid of

2523
01:48:53,611 --> 01:48:55,710
this.
And that was when I started driving for

2524
01:48:55,711 --> 01:48:57,600
Chevy and then I got to Tahoe and I like
that.

2525
01:48:57,601 --> 01:49:01,230
And then I got a chevy and they didn't
give you a corvette.

2526
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,910
I didn't ask for one.

2527
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:08,940
How could you not want one driving force
in a practical car?

2528
01:49:08,941 --> 01:49:13,320
If I wanted a corvette I could buy one.
I know you're good.

2529
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:15,000
But I would say be like,
come on,

2530
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,140
hook it up.
I'm not.

2531
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:21,660
Come on girl.
We went though.

2532
01:49:21,661 --> 01:49:23,610
I keep.
I keep wanting to catch you in that lie.

2533
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:24,361
No,
I,

2534
01:49:24,361 --> 01:49:25,710
I,
I don't care.

2535
01:49:25,711 --> 01:49:28,020
I just,
I have cars or like purses for me.

2536
01:49:28,021 --> 01:49:29,100
I just need one.
Nice one.

2537
01:49:29,120 --> 01:49:30,540
And where's that?
I'll get a new one.

2538
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:33,160
You don't like purses?
Not really.

2539
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,880
Just needed one.
That looks good.

2540
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:38,790
And
what about shoes?

2541
01:49:39,190 --> 01:49:41,310
I like shoes.
I have a lot of shoes.

2542
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:45,210
You're a girl?
I'm definitely a girl,

2543
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:48,220
but not purses.
What about a curl?

2544
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,430
My own hair today.
Wow,

2545
01:49:49,431 --> 01:49:50,780
that's crazy.
How'd you do makeup?

2546
01:49:50,810 --> 01:49:52,620
Yeah,
my shoulder hurt

2547
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,473
a little bit.

2548
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:57,950
Hairspray.
What is this stuff now?

2549
01:49:57,951 --> 01:49:59,960
I'm very much a girl.
I believe you.

2550
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:03,470
That's what if people ask me what,
what is it about you that people would

2551
01:50:03,471 --> 01:50:06,920
be surprised and I'm telling them like
much more girly away from the track than

2552
01:50:06,921 --> 01:50:09,770
you'd think because I'm really
aggressive at the track and I don't look

2553
01:50:09,771 --> 01:50:12,050
very happy and away from the track.
I'm.

2554
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:16,490
I try and be funny and I smile more and
I'm much more relaxed.

2555
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:21,920
Are you surprised that with all your
success and all the attention that

2556
01:50:21,921 --> 01:50:26,921
you've gotten from your success as the
only woman on your level in professional

2557
01:50:27,651 --> 01:50:29,890
racing,
are you surprised that more women aren't

2558
01:50:29,891 --> 01:50:32,090
entering in,
that you haven't like sort of opened the

2559
01:50:32,091 --> 01:50:37,091
door or do you think that it's such a
specialized and unique thing to do that

2560
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:40,670
it's just not something that a lot of
women gravitate towards?

2561
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:44,360
I used to say that for 100 men that came
through,

2562
01:50:44,361 --> 01:50:47,570
if you found a good,
he takes 100 to find a good one that

2563
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:50,810
comes pretty quickly,
but to go through 100 women takes a lot

2564
01:50:50,811 --> 01:50:55,190
longer because there are so few of them.
There are more coming through,

2565
01:50:55,191 --> 01:50:56,310
but I just think that,
you know,

2566
01:50:56,311 --> 01:50:59,180
over time it just takes a lot longer to
find good ones,

2567
01:50:59,181 --> 01:51:00,530
but I don't know.
I don't know.

2568
01:51:00,531 --> 01:51:03,680
I,
I think back to,

2569
01:51:03,681 --> 01:51:04,940
uh,
this is my ego talking.

2570
01:51:04,941 --> 01:51:08,770
I think back to a long time ago,
um,

2571
01:51:08,900 --> 01:51:12,260
when I'm.
Paul Newman was still alive and we were

2572
01:51:12,261 --> 01:51:14,060
on a late night show to the other
probably Letterman,

2573
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:18,170
and he was asked before I went on,
he was the first guest if there was

2574
01:51:18,171 --> 01:51:20,720
going to be another driver,
another girl that comes through that

2575
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:22,610
compares to me and he said he didn't
think so

2576
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:27,100
maybe there won't be.
Maybe there will be no shit.

2577
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,110
Yeah,
he knew his shit.

2578
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:30,340
Maybe.
I mean,

2579
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:33,940
you're unique.
I'm sure there will be some day I meet a

2580
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:37,120
lot of women like you because of mma.
Oh,

2581
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:40,240
there's those savages that enter into
mma.

2582
01:51:40,270 --> 01:51:45,270
The women that wind up fighting in MMA,
there's a lot of them and I'm kind of

2583
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:51,100
stunned at how many there are.
But when I say they're like you,

2584
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:54,340
I mean they're bold,
powerful,

2585
01:51:54,341 --> 01:51:57,880
unique people that are,
does take wild chances.

2586
01:51:57,881 --> 01:52:00,670
I mean the type of person that is like a
holly home or something like that,

2587
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:04,250
so I think the big difference lies and
there are a lot of people that are

2588
01:52:04,251 --> 01:52:05,270
strong,
aggressive,

2589
01:52:05,271 --> 01:52:07,490
confident,
assertive,

2590
01:52:07,550 --> 01:52:11,270
bold,
but to then be able to keep it together

2591
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:15,940
and I'm up up above their shoulders.
That's another,

2592
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,520
that's the difference.
Keep it together in the pressure of a

2593
01:52:19,521 --> 01:52:20,354
race.
Yeah.

2594
01:52:20,570 --> 01:52:22,880
And the pressure of whatever moment or
the tablet you're having,

2595
01:52:22,881 --> 01:52:26,600
whatever pressures are being put on you
around an event or for one.

2596
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:28,700
I mean those are,
that's really hard.

2597
01:52:28,970 --> 01:52:33,950
The right people around you being able
to filter the shit and lead in like keep

2598
01:52:33,951 --> 01:52:36,860
the good,
keep your own confidence up.

2599
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:39,740
That's,
that's hard.

2600
01:52:40,190 --> 01:52:43,160
That's the hardest part.
And then being able to flip that switch

2601
01:52:43,161 --> 01:52:46,520
when you're performing to,
of course then not have doubts,

2602
01:52:46,521 --> 01:52:48,860
but I'm more confidence.

2603
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:54,250
I think everything that you said would
be mirrored by what a woman who competes

2604
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:56,630
at the very highest levels of MMA would
say.

2605
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:00,260
I think they would.
They would find all those things to be

2606
01:53:00,261 --> 01:53:01,550
factors,
you know,

2607
01:53:01,551 --> 01:53:02,041
it's just,
um,

2608
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:05,630
I'm really stunned that you literally
are the only one.

2609
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:06,350
I mean,
there's,

2610
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:08,960
that's a,
that's a incredibly rare position.

2611
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,330
Do you ever stop and think about like,
what if you weren't there?

2612
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:14,660
It's not like it's forbidden for women.

2613
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:18,790
I never thought about it like that.
I've mostly only thought about it from

2614
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:23,110
the perspective of like,
have I thought about what I've done in

2615
01:53:23,111 --> 01:53:28,111
the sport because it's stuff that people
haven't done before and usually my

2616
01:53:28,301 --> 01:53:31,690
answer is,
is that someday I'll look back and be

2617
01:53:31,691 --> 01:53:33,640
able to have a little bit more
perspective on it,

2618
01:53:33,641 --> 01:53:35,470
but right now just to kind of in the
middle of it.

2619
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:36,553
Um,

2620
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:38,670
but yeah,
I've never thought about it like that.

2621
01:53:38,671 --> 01:53:40,080
Like what if I was never there?

2622
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:41,691
Yeah,
I mean,

2623
01:53:41,691 --> 01:53:43,790
you're the only one.
So if you were never there,

2624
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:47,890
what it would,
it would just be constantly a boys club

2625
01:53:47,891 --> 01:53:48,940
forever.
I mean,

2626
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:50,380
I'm just,
I'm,

2627
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:54,820
I'm really fascinated by complete
outliers and you're a complete outlier

2628
01:53:54,821 --> 01:53:56,350
in that regard.
I mean,

2629
01:53:56,351 --> 01:53:58,720
there's not like 30 girls,
oh,

2630
01:53:58,721 --> 01:54:02,350
there's 500 man.
But there's 30 girls know how many men

2631
01:54:02,351 --> 01:54:03,250
are Nascar drivers?

2632
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:04,660
Uh,
well the field is 40.

2633
01:54:05,010 --> 01:54:07,350
Yeah.
So 40 men one check.

2634
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,970
That's crazy.
And then there's a bunch of people that

2635
01:54:10,971 --> 01:54:13,820
are trying to do it.
Like how are there any women that are

2636
01:54:13,821 --> 01:54:14,560
trying

2637
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,670
our formula is others,
some that do some part time stuff.

2638
01:54:17,671 --> 01:54:21,090
And I'm trying to think of someone has
done like a full season.

2639
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:26,520
I don't know,
back in indy car there was some girls

2640
01:54:26,521 --> 01:54:29,720
who did more.
There were at one,

2641
01:54:29,730 --> 01:54:31,650
one indy 500,
there was like five of us.

2642
01:54:32,580 --> 01:54:34,050
But most of the time there's none

2643
01:54:34,390 --> 01:54:35,230
or one

2644
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:38,810
comes in waves.

2645
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:43,040
Do you start,
I mean do you think that when you stop

2646
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:48,160
and you look back in your career,
you'll take into account and maybe have

2647
01:54:49,551 --> 01:54:52,340
a more objective sense of what an impact
that you've had?

2648
01:54:54,810 --> 01:54:58,470
Of course,
but I need distance from it.

2649
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,580
I need to gain perspective that way.
Does that make sense?

2650
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:06,600
Does sharing your career too,
like I mean to be able to identify the

2651
01:55:06,990 --> 01:55:09,600
things that you've done,
the influence you've had over people

2652
01:55:09,601 --> 01:55:11,700
with the conversations you've had with
the,

2653
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,750
with the things in business you've done?
I mean it's hard to see when you're in

2654
01:55:15,751 --> 01:55:17,660
the middle of it.
Yeah.

2655
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:20,310
I don't look at that.
You don't want to look at that

2656
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:25,560
because I want to get distracted.
That's why people don't in the moment

2657
01:55:25,561 --> 01:55:26,520
because it doesn't matter.

2658
01:55:26,740 --> 01:55:27,870
Yeah,
but I'm what I'm doing.

2659
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:30,780
A lot of people are doing what you're
doing is very.

2660
01:55:31,030 --> 01:55:36,030
It just tends to be a woman that does
the thing that many men think is

2661
01:55:36,811 --> 01:55:39,960
probably one of the most manly things
you could do other than fighting and

2662
01:55:39,961 --> 01:55:42,870
maybe football.
A race car driver,

2663
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:44,010
like a little boy.
What are you want

2664
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,770
to be when you grew up building?
I'm in a race car driver,

2665
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:48,540
but that's just lying to me.
Queen.

2666
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:53,040
I mean it's like a natural thing for men
to gravitate

2667
01:55:53,120 --> 01:55:55,040
towards.
His Dad always said he was just like,

2668
01:55:55,041 --> 01:55:58,100
Gosh,
I cursed with three girls in the house.

2669
01:55:58,101 --> 01:56:00,020
He goes,
my mom and then me and my sister and I'm

2670
01:56:00,021 --> 01:56:00,460
like,

2671
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:01,900
Dad,
what more did you want?

2672
01:56:01,930 --> 01:56:03,000
Like what more did you want with

2673
01:56:03,050 --> 01:56:05,660
you had a boy as a son,
like what was he going to do that's

2674
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:07,560
cooler than what I'm doing?

2675
01:56:08,180 --> 01:56:10,670
He'd be out there banging chicks.
That's what he's missing.

2676
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:14,210
You think my dad would think that was

2677
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:17,450
cool.
If his son was banging chicks?

2678
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:19,760
I would think probably that's my boy.

2679
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,830
Scared shitless for me.
Yeah.

2680
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:28,110
That's got to be.
I think still in my adult life.

2681
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:28,944
It's like

2682
01:56:30,040 --> 01:56:34,000
they had the courage to let you go to
England by herself when you were 16.

2683
01:56:34,290 --> 01:56:38,680
I mean that and race over there on
another continent all the way across an

2684
01:56:38,681 --> 01:56:41,110
ocean sort of.
You did get hurt to get to.

2685
01:56:41,111 --> 01:56:42,400
You would take forever.

2686
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:45,290
Yeah.
Bold.

2687
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,190
What is the worst crash you've ever been
in?

2688
01:56:48,730 --> 01:56:52,760
My first crash in Indycar,
so my very first race kind of paralleled

2689
01:56:52,761 --> 01:56:54,830
getting in a go kart for the first time.
Having a big crash.

2690
01:56:54,831 --> 01:56:57,990
But yeah,
it was homestead Miami and uh,

2691
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:02,510
there's a big accident and I was running
low and someone was sliding down the

2692
01:57:02,511 --> 01:57:06,650
track that had damage and they clipped
my right rear and shot me up into the

2693
01:57:06,651 --> 01:57:11,651
wall headfirst and
slid down the track and I don't remember

2694
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:13,700
that part.
I don't remember getting out.

2695
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:15,440
I don't remember walking to the
ambulance,

2696
01:57:15,441 --> 01:57:19,220
but there's footage of all of it.
And I walked the wrong way away from the

2697
01:57:19,221 --> 01:57:21,800
ambulance.
I was walking the opposite direction and

2698
01:57:21,801 --> 01:57:26,150
then I was kind of stumbling around and
then I got back to the back to the

2699
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,290
medical truck and then I got in and
apparently I was very repetitive on the

2700
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:34,400
way to the hospital and I kept asking
them did it look bad?

2701
01:57:36,020 --> 01:57:38,060
And they're like,
you've asked us to add a few times.

2702
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:39,940
And I'm like,
Oh,

2703
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:41,600
I'll just stop.
Oh yeah,

2704
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:43,430
yeah.
That's a severe concussion.

2705
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:46,490
That's one of the things that happens is
the people ask the same questions over

2706
01:57:46,491 --> 01:57:47,324
and over again.

2707
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:48,680
Well,
then I've had one.

2708
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:51,500
Let's hope I don't have a cte.
I'm sure you probably do.

2709
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:53,640
I probably do.
Yeah.

2710
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:57,160
Just a little bit.
That touch matter makes you more risky.

2711
01:57:57,310 --> 01:57:59,540
Why does it does.
Yeah,

2712
01:57:59,600 --> 01:58:01,600
that's crazy.
That sort of thing.

2713
01:58:01,601 --> 01:58:03,610
One of the things it does,
it makes people more impulsive.

2714
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:06,670
Do UFC people get.
Yeah.

2715
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,490
One hundred percent.
Did you see that video?

2716
01:58:09,491 --> 01:58:11,430
Is there,
are they doing studies in UFC like they

2717
01:58:11,431 --> 01:58:16,200
did in the nfl with.
I'm doing tests after they've passed

2718
01:58:16,201 --> 01:58:20,710
away to know if they had cte,
isn't that would nfl had they like,

2719
01:58:20,730 --> 01:58:22,800
uh,
there was a study that came out last

2720
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,870
year.
It was like almost all but one out of

2721
01:58:24,871 --> 01:58:26,580
100 and some had cte.

2722
01:58:26,920 --> 01:58:27,753
Yeah,
it was.

2723
01:58:27,970 --> 01:58:29,380
I forget the numbers,
but yeah,

2724
01:58:29,381 --> 01:58:31,420
there was only like one or two people
that didn't have.

2725
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:34,210
It
hasn't done that.

2726
01:58:34,211 --> 01:58:36,490
Doc hasn't been around as long as the
NFL obviously.

2727
01:58:36,491 --> 01:58:40,600
So we were not dealing with the same
data pool,

2728
01:58:40,601 --> 01:58:42,040
but I'm sure when people

2729
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:45,460
do pass away we're going to find it.
It's just varying levels.

2730
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:47,950
I heard they actually have a test now
for cte.

2731
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:51,330
I was talking to a trauma surgeon that
you're alive.

2732
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:57,550
What would you do if you had it?
Make excuses.

2733
01:58:58,030 --> 01:59:00,970
I just go extra crazy.
Well,

2734
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:02,200
that's why I'm gambling.
Naked

2735
01:59:04,430 --> 01:59:09,430
bottle of whiskey in each arm.
Chug,

2736
01:59:11,321 --> 01:59:12,310
Chug,
pals.

2737
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:15,220
So insightful.
This question,

2738
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:19,720
did you see the video that just came out
from a couple of days ago from the guy

2739
01:59:19,721 --> 01:59:23,860
that hit the off ramp and went flying
through the air and landed in a house in

2740
01:59:23,861 --> 01:59:27,040
the second floor of a house?
His car's poking out the side,

2741
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:29,230
but I couldn't.
He couldn't do it again if he had to.

2742
01:59:29,231 --> 01:59:30,140
I'm sure.
No,

2743
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:31,240
no.
It's just total random.

2744
01:59:31,241 --> 01:59:33,730
Crazy luck.
But it is hilarious.

2745
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:37,440
I made
and see if you.

2746
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:40,140
Once you find it,
go then go to Christa.

2747
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:43,630
Lee is instagram because Taleah had a
hilarious meme that he created,

2748
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,910
but this car hit this hit like a
barrier.

2749
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:52,960
Hit one of those cement barriers and
literally got launched into the air and

2750
01:59:52,961 --> 01:59:56,050
stuck into the second floor of a
building and.

2751
01:59:57,160 --> 01:59:59,780
Oh,
what country was this in?

2752
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:01,093
Morocco?
America.

2753
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:04,930
Margo to people escape the injuries.
Serious injuries.

2754
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:07,600
How the fuck did.
I mean I wonder how they got out of the

2755
02:00:07,601 --> 02:00:08,720
car.
I mean it's,

2756
02:00:08,721 --> 02:00:11,380
it's the way it's hanging out of the
building.

2757
02:00:12,140 --> 02:00:14,590
Hopefully it's front wheel drive and
they could keep accelerating to get a

2758
02:00:14,591 --> 02:00:17,770
little further in so they can get out of
the car that's spoken like a true race

2759
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:19,630
cars.
Take it about it that way.

2760
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:21,040
Yeah.
Here it is.

2761
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:26,160
Here's the video footage so you could
see it and there's the car washes it

2762
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:29,530
hits.
See this is that.

2763
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:32,850
It's hard to tell there,
but they literally went across traffic.

2764
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:37,600
You can see it again.
The guy goes across,

2765
02:00:37,601 --> 02:00:39,850
traffic,
flies into the air seat.

2766
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:41,500
Go to Christa,
Leah's page,

2767
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:44,190
his instagram page and find the meme
because then you can see that and what

2768
02:00:44,191 --> 02:00:45,580
do you.
So let's get this guys.

2769
02:00:45,581 --> 02:00:46,231
Oh,
that's crystal.

2770
02:00:46,231 --> 02:00:47,470
He is there.
He says,

2771
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:49,060
come here.
Come over me.

2772
02:00:49,061 --> 02:00:50,380
I can't tonight.
Her.

2773
02:00:50,381 --> 02:00:55,090
My parents were on the first floor and
second floor and I have been calling me.

2774
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:03,280
That fucking car is stuck inside that
building.

2775
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:06,010
I mean you to believe that that was
real.

2776
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:08,410
If you didn't see it.
There

2777
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:12,760
is that need,
that dentist office that he just parked

2778
02:01:12,761 --> 02:01:14,870
his cell phone himself after that.
Yeah.

2779
02:01:14,890 --> 02:01:17,440
Here's the question.
What do you do if you're in the car?

2780
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:20,350
Like it gets stuck there?
Even climate probably drunk.

2781
02:01:20,351 --> 02:01:21,210
You got to be drunk,
right?

2782
02:01:21,230 --> 02:01:23,320
I mean there's nobody or something.
So you just,

2783
02:01:23,321 --> 02:01:25,990
you opened the door and you wait.
You uh,

2784
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
you take on the sprained ankle and you
jump and then it lands on your fucking

2785
02:01:31,001 --> 02:01:33,520
head.
The thing falls out of the building,

2786
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:36,030
the right thing here.
You call the cops.

2787
02:01:36,031 --> 02:01:37,560
You are honest.
You

2788
02:01:39,440 --> 02:01:40,273
video

2789
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:42,020
is there a bit coins and then you go,

2790
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,460
oh my God,
that's funny.

2791
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:45,560
Who put up the video?
Where's the video from?

2792
02:01:46,130 --> 02:01:47,990
Some dudes name?
What is his name?

2793
02:01:47,991 --> 02:01:50,960
Kenny homes.
It's k homes live.

2794
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:52,750
He's the guy who had for.
Oh,

2795
02:01:52,890 --> 02:01:54,080
he's from NBC.
La.

2796
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:55,490
I guess.
MInor injuries.

2797
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:56,661
That's crazy.
Oh,

2798
02:01:56,661 --> 02:01:58,130
santa ana.
Santa ana.

2799
02:01:58,131 --> 02:02:01,310
People are out of their fucking mind.
That's where eddie bravo's from santa

2800
02:02:01,311 --> 02:02:01,970
ana.
People.

2801
02:02:01,970 --> 02:02:03,890
Boom.
Look at that car flying through the air.

2802
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:06,470
It's just the fact that it's stuck into
the building.

2803
02:02:06,471 --> 02:02:07,730
That's just so ridiculous.

2804
02:02:07,780 --> 02:02:10,870
It's probably froM movie now.
When you drive in regular life,

2805
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:14,050
you a lead foot.
I'm a very aggressive driver.

2806
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:15,730
Yes I am.
I'm,

2807
02:02:15,820 --> 02:02:19,960
I have a large comfort zone.
I say people piss me off a lot.

2808
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:23,070
They are horrible drivers and I,
I'm,

2809
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:24,453
I'm,
I'm very,

2810
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:24,941
uh,
yeah.

2811
02:02:24,941 --> 02:02:27,820
The only way I can make sure that I
don't get a speeding ticket is to not

2812
02:02:27,821 --> 02:02:30,220
drive.
How many speeding tickets have you

2813
02:02:30,221 --> 02:02:30,761
gotten?
Oh,

2814
02:02:30,761 --> 02:02:35,761
I've been pulled over at least 20 times.
I got pulled over three times in three

2815
02:02:35,951 --> 02:02:39,910
days at one point when I had my mustang
cobra,

2816
02:02:39,911 --> 02:02:42,940
my first ever car.
Oh jesus.

2817
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:44,530
See,
that's why I'm surprised you don't have

2818
02:02:44,531 --> 02:02:45,890
a fast car.
Oh,

2819
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:48,550
I always make sure iT's a good car,
like that fast car.

2820
02:02:48,551 --> 02:02:51,070
But I mean like today,
like right now,

2821
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:53,400
like when you drive,
driving around,

2822
02:02:53,410 --> 02:02:54,400
pulling up.
No,

2823
02:02:54,401 --> 02:02:54,760
no,
no.

2824
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:56,410
I mean your everyday life.
Yeah,

2825
02:02:56,411 --> 02:03:00,280
well I'm driving rentals because I don't
live here.

2826
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:03,400
I mean not.
I mean here in real life and real life.

2827
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:04,910
Oh yeah.
Like where's my sports car?

2828
02:03:05,680 --> 02:03:07,350
Yeah,
well I,

2829
02:03:07,351 --> 02:03:09,070
you know,
in 40 weeks a year I do that.

2830
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:12,460
So you just get it over.
I got two dogs.

2831
02:03:12,490 --> 02:03:14,710
Right.
So you get enough of it.

2832
02:03:14,711 --> 02:03:16,750
All my bags,
I feel like I'm trying to sell you a

2833
02:03:16,751 --> 02:03:18,880
car.
What car should I buy?

2834
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:24,280
I would say something american,
something american made cars tend to

2835
02:03:24,281 --> 02:03:26,110
die.
I don't care if they are or aren't

2836
02:03:26,140 --> 02:03:30,370
really why I have a porsche I liked.
I like german cars too.

2837
02:03:30,430 --> 02:03:33,160
They're more reliable.
What I like about american cars is I

2838
02:03:33,161 --> 02:03:35,980
like the sound.
I liked the way they just is a rumble

2839
02:03:35,981 --> 02:03:39,370
throatiness to it,
to it you like to like.

2840
02:03:39,371 --> 02:03:42,640
So you like to make noise on the road.
I'm a loud person.

2841
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:46,630
Yeah.
I have a 65 corvette with straight

2842
02:03:46,631 --> 02:03:50,380
pipes.
Those pipes kind of know what that is.

2843
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,920
I can picture it kind of race car
driver,

2844
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,730
but it's a step.
That's what's important.

2845
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:56,493
I,
I

2846
02:03:57,740 --> 02:03:58,600
don't care,

2847
02:03:58,980 --> 02:04:01,590
but I would feel like where someone like
you,

2848
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:04,950
once you transitioned away from racing,
then it's going to be more important to

2849
02:04:04,951 --> 02:04:07,770
you because you're gonna miss the
capabilities of those things.

2850
02:04:07,770 --> 02:04:10,140
That might be true.
That might be true.

2851
02:04:10,141 --> 02:04:11,170
I might have to.
Uh.

2852
02:04:12,190 --> 02:04:13,023
Oh,
there's my car.

2853
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:15,020
Oh,
that is a good looking car.

2854
02:04:15,030 --> 02:04:16,080
Sweet car.
Jay leno,

2855
02:04:16,081 --> 02:04:18,120
of course.
Of course he loves cars,

2856
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:21,510
not,
I also don't really like old cars,

2857
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:22,381
so,
um,

2858
02:04:22,381 --> 02:04:24,300
that looks pretty good.
It's pretty fancy looking.

2859
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:26,040
But um,
yeah,

2860
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,360
I'm,
I'm a new car person.

2861
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:30,180
I like new modern sports cars.

2862
02:04:30,650 --> 02:04:34,010
I do as well,
but that car is a 65 on the outside,

2863
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:38,490
but all the underpinnings are completely
modern as a [inaudible] supercharged

2864
02:04:38,491 --> 02:04:41,230
engine.
So it does a modern corvette engine.

2865
02:04:41,231 --> 02:04:43,830
It's got modern brakes,
modern suspension.

2866
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:45,660
You don't know what any of that stuff
means.

2867
02:04:45,910 --> 02:04:46,890
Yeah.
That's cool.

2868
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:48,300
Great.
I know that my very first car,

2869
02:04:48,301 --> 02:04:51,360
my mustang cobra,
I drove it so hard that I needed an

2870
02:04:51,361 --> 02:04:53,720
8,000 miles.
I was on my third set of brakes.

2871
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:59,880
Uh,
we put stiffer sway bars in it so that

2872
02:04:59,881 --> 02:05:02,400
it would handle better.
Um,

2873
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,600
it was,
uh,

2874
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:04,620
yeah,
I went through three,

2875
02:05:04,621 --> 02:05:06,090
so yeah,
it was on my third set of brakes and

2876
02:05:06,091 --> 02:05:06,924
8,000 miles.

2877
02:05:07,010 --> 02:05:09,320
And now you say mustang cobra.
Like what year was this?

2878
02:05:09,670 --> 02:05:10,540
Oh,
this is when I first.

2879
02:05:10,541 --> 02:05:12,400
This is my first ever car,
so I was 16.

2880
02:05:12,401 --> 02:05:14,620
So I think it was a,
um,

2881
02:05:15,010 --> 02:05:18,840
a 97.
It was,

2882
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:19,823
yeah,
it was.

2883
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:23,580
I'm not saying they're not cool,
but it was back when they were more cool

2884
02:05:23,610 --> 02:05:26,550
when you know,
they were a lot less common.

2885
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:28,900
Yeah,
they were okay.

2886
02:05:28,901 --> 02:05:31,250
But I kind of back into the cobra.
Cool days.

2887
02:05:31,790 --> 02:05:32,940
No,
the 90 seconds.

2888
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:34,750
We're okay.
There are like,

2889
02:05:34,751 --> 02:05:38,050
it run the eighties is when they came
out with the five point.

2890
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:40,540
Oh.
And then like mustangs had a little bit

2891
02:05:40,541 --> 02:05:41,374
more power again.

2892
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:44,640
So what's your dream car then?
That corvette.

2893
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:46,770
That's my favorite car now what?
Then?

2894
02:05:47,190 --> 02:05:48,420
No,
try that around.

2895
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:52,380
Do you drive it much all the time?
Well it doesn't really rain in

2896
02:05:52,381 --> 02:05:53,610
California,
so I guess you can.

2897
02:05:53,650 --> 02:05:55,070
Well it has top.
He put.

2898
02:05:56,070 --> 02:05:58,690
I have no good for you.
Good for you.

2899
02:05:58,840 --> 02:05:59,990
It's just a car?
Yeah.

2900
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,160
Oh man.
I'm not afraid of it getting wet.

2901
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:06,490
The only problem is it's slippery.
It doesn't have any control or any of

2902
02:06:06,491 --> 02:06:09,250
that.
It's just all engine power and torque

2903
02:06:09,251 --> 02:06:10,690
and yeah,
that's fun.

2904
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:13,760
Yeah.
I remember driving a camaro around in

2905
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:16,760
the rain and it was handled like trap.

2906
02:06:16,790 --> 02:06:18,470
Just get one of the new ones,
camaro.

2907
02:06:18,471 --> 02:06:20,000
zl one.
They have a new one,

2908
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:23,060
650 horsepower.
It's fucking ridiculOus.

2909
02:06:23,750 --> 02:06:26,300
I mean,
nobody even barely uses the full speed.

2910
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:28,280
I don't know.
What am I?

2911
02:06:28,280 --> 02:06:29,810
Oh,
So I was actually going to tell you

2912
02:06:29,811 --> 02:06:30,531
about this.
This is,

2913
02:06:30,531 --> 02:06:32,700
I did A road and track,
um,

2914
02:06:32,780 --> 02:06:35,890
cover article where I test drove,
um,

2915
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:38,360
um,
it was a porsche,

2916
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,790
a corvette.
Um,

2917
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:44,510
it,
I think it waS a viper of some sort of

2918
02:06:44,540 --> 02:06:46,370
viper.
And then there was um,

2919
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:47,910
A,
a,

2920
02:06:47,911 --> 02:06:50,720
a lamborghini mercia logo.
And I'll,

2921
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:54,740
I mean my exPerience was the,
the porsche was loose,

2922
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:57,920
which is this one.
The corvette was tight,

2923
02:06:57,921 --> 02:07:00,650
which meant it was the most comfortable
and stable to drive.

2924
02:07:01,090 --> 02:07:02,240
Um,
the,

2925
02:07:02,241 --> 02:07:04,160
uh,
I think it was a viper.

2926
02:07:04,220 --> 02:07:08,540
The viper was just light on its feet,
kinda just didn't really.

2927
02:07:08,541 --> 02:07:11,240
It wasn't very stuck and it was just
kind of clunky.

2928
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:11,970
that looks like

2929
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:13,860
it's about seven or eight years old.
Is that right?

2930
02:07:13,910 --> 02:07:14,610
Oh,
at least.

2931
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:15,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

2932
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:15,971
And then,
uh,

2933
02:07:15,971 --> 02:07:16,630
the,
the,

2934
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,890
the lamborghini was,
was also light.

2935
02:07:18,891 --> 02:07:22,190
I mean it just went so fast,
but it's pretty well balanced,

2936
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:23,990
but probably a little on the loose side.
So

2937
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:25,520
you know,
they stopped making vipers,

2938
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:29,030
but I know the car for you.
Does it car that's for sale right now

2939
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:30,800
that uh,
I saw this morning.

2940
02:07:30,830 --> 02:07:31,663
No,
no.

2941
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:36,800
I'm trying to sell you a car.
This whole giappo link had a rare,

2942
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:40,130
one of the,
this one dealership in 2017.

2943
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:44,590
The country bought up like 90 percent of
the vipers and they ordered them in a

2944
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:48,790
bunch of crazy paint schemes and they
ordered this hot pink viper.

2945
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:51,940
ShuT up.
You got to see it.

2946
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:54,400
I drive it.
It's so fucking bad ass.

2947
02:07:54,401 --> 02:07:59,140
I'd drive it cooler if a dude who drive
a pink car and I would drive like some

2948
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:01,510
like stainless steel,
silver,

2949
02:08:02,060 --> 02:08:03,970
you know,
I would drive it and then I'd get a

2950
02:08:03,971 --> 02:08:07,060
rainbow license plate so people would
just assume I'm gay.

2951
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:09,760
There's no way around it.
I had a rainbow platE.

2952
02:08:09,990 --> 02:08:11,110
You've got a pink car.

2953
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:15,610
Just let it out and found it.
Isn't that it's shit.

2954
02:08:15,910 --> 02:08:19,210
It was a google news feed this morning.
I looked at that.

2955
02:08:19,211 --> 02:08:21,090
I was like,
if I was at church I'd Be my fucking

2956
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:24,730
car,
but it's like crazy metallic hot pink

2957
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:28,210
viper.
Mary kay car.

2958
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:29,140
No,
that's not it.

2959
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:30,910
That's old.
That shit's old.

2960
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:32,710
That's red.
That's red.

2961
02:08:33,310 --> 02:08:38,310
It's a 2017 does.
It might not even be joppa like I might

2962
02:08:39,380 --> 02:08:40,960
have.
That was think that was what I was

2963
02:08:40,961 --> 02:08:42,390
reading.
Drive it.

2964
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:44,740
You don't have to pull it up.
It's good thought.

2965
02:08:44,741 --> 02:08:47,620
But I'm rather have black.
Let me guess.

2966
02:08:48,420 --> 02:08:52,090
Black
tinted windows.

2967
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:52,721
Black,
black,

2968
02:08:52,721 --> 02:08:54,190
black,
black.

2969
02:08:54,370 --> 02:08:55,750
Whoa.
Darkness.

2970
02:08:56,470 --> 02:09:00,010
Like a darth vader type thing.
So bad ass.

2971
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:02,410
More.
More masculine than feminine.

2972
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:05,560
Yeah.
Trying to figure out what kind of.

2973
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:06,340
Oh,
there it is.

2974
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:08,920
That's not it.
But that's an old one too.

2975
02:09:08,970 --> 02:09:10,570
That's terrible.
But it's all right.

2976
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:13,930
No worries.
So if someone lookS gross,

2977
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:18,010
the other one didn't look so gross.
It's more of a darker pink.

2978
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:19,960
You don't have to find A chamber.
Forget it.

2979
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:22,240
She's.
She's going to hate it no matter what.

2980
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:24,370
She wants darth vader,
Pink.

2981
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:26,030
Corvettes.
That a angelina.

2982
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:30,450
I saw her the other day.
I started driving that know new

2983
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:34,030
angelina's.
Angelina is a woman who,

2984
02:09:34,031 --> 02:09:36,670
when I moved to California in the
nineties,

2985
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:40,250
she used to have these billboards all
around California of what?

2986
02:09:40,630 --> 02:09:45,220
It's her.
Her like in her bikini line and it would

2987
02:09:45,290 --> 02:09:48,790
just say her,
it would just say her name and her phone

2988
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:51,730
number and that's those,
those billboards.

2989
02:09:51,810 --> 02:09:54,120
Oh shoot.
That's right.

2990
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:55,990
And so these.
And I'd Be like,

2991
02:09:55,991 --> 02:09:57,670
where the fuck is angelina?
And everybody be like,

2992
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:59,530
oh,
I was just like this local celebrity.

2993
02:09:59,740 --> 02:10:04,390
And so she apparently is just a wealthy
lady who uh,

2994
02:10:04,540 --> 02:10:09,370
all of her time here has done that.
Just got these big biLlboards.

2995
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:12,790
Yeah.
She's doing a split on top of a corvette

2996
02:10:14,020 --> 02:10:17,240
grand.
Is that a good thing for her?

2997
02:10:17,241 --> 02:10:22,241
Maybe she kept doing it,
so she still does it right.

2998
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:23,530
There's,
you still have a billboard?

2999
02:10:23,650 --> 02:10:24,680
Not a billboard,
but I just,

3000
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:27,490
she has at least three different print
corvettes and I've seen,

3001
02:10:27,550 --> 02:10:30,250
I've seen her really recently in the
pink corvette.

3002
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:32,690
Yeah.
But not me.

3003
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:33,593
Not,
you

3004
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:35,330
know,
I'm more like,

3005
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:39,320
I'm more of your subdue.
Actually when I got the lamborghini and

3006
02:10:39,330 --> 02:10:42,920
I had to go pick my sister up from the
airport.

3007
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:44,450
Okay.
There's nowhere to put your.

3008
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:47,750
Put your bags.
It's like a briefcase for,

3009
02:10:48,110 --> 02:10:53,110
for a trunk and it's in the front.
So that was kind of silly and then I

3010
02:10:54,381 --> 02:10:57,740
realized that people normally get these
cars so they can just kind of take it

3011
02:10:57,741 --> 02:11:00,620
out to dinner.
I don't want to be looked at so I'm not

3012
02:11:00,621 --> 02:11:02,780
going to.
I'm more likely to take it to go get

3013
02:11:02,781 --> 02:11:06,650
groceries than I am to go to dinner.
So I realized it was pretty pointless

3014
02:11:06,651 --> 02:11:08,220
for me.
Yeah,

3015
02:11:08,450 --> 02:11:11,570
that's not the car for you.
And if I want performance I go do my job

3016
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:14,680
for now.
For now.

3017
02:11:14,890 --> 02:11:16,510
But when it's over it,
that's what I'm trying to look.

3018
02:11:16,570 --> 02:11:17,910
I'm trying to keep trying to sell me
your.

3019
02:11:17,911 --> 02:11:19,300
You're looking forward.
Yeah.

3020
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:21,490
I'm looking forward after these next two
races.

3021
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:24,490
We'll have to visit again in a year,
a year from now and.

3022
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:28,330
And have to figure this,
figure it all out.

3023
02:11:28,380 --> 02:11:29,350
You.
I'll tell you,

3024
02:11:29,351 --> 02:11:30,490
you're right.
Probably.

3025
02:11:30,520 --> 02:11:32,590
Well a year from now.
Then the new corvette,

3026
02:11:32,591 --> 02:11:37,150
zr one will be available.
750 horsepower.

3027
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:41,410
Stupid two seconds.
We're going to use it.

3028
02:11:41,411 --> 02:11:44,020
So you might use the zero 1650 speeding
tickets.

3029
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:45,500
So he talking to you,
is it?

3030
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:48,070
It's true.
Nobody.

3031
02:11:48,071 --> 02:11:50,520
Ain't nobody got a speeding ticket for
getting the speed limit to quickly

3032
02:11:50,521 --> 02:11:51,690
though.
That's true.

3033
02:11:51,960 --> 02:11:52,531
Yeah.
Well,

3034
02:11:52,531 --> 02:11:53,960
they probably would pull you over.
Anyway,

3035
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:57,930
funny story about when I got pulled over
when I was 16 with my mustang cobra,

3036
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,840
I was picking my girlfriend up and
pulling out of her,

3037
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:05,730
her off of her straight onto the main
street and it was wet out and so I kinda

3038
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:08,970
got it going and kicked it sideways a
little bit and looked in my rear view

3039
02:12:08,971 --> 02:12:11,310
mirror at the stoplight and there's a
cop sitting there.

3040
02:12:12,040 --> 02:12:15,660
Well he comes for me,
so I Turned on the first road I can

3041
02:12:15,661 --> 02:12:18,240
find.
So I make a left drive down the road.

3042
02:12:18,870 --> 02:12:22,800
It's fricking dead end.
So I pull into a driveway and we

3043
02:12:22,801 --> 02:12:26,610
slouched down real low and the cop kind
of drives around and all of a sudden

3044
02:12:26,611 --> 02:12:27,880
somebody comes out from the house now

3045
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:29,010
can I help you?
And I'm like,

3046
02:12:29,011 --> 02:12:30,540
ah,
what road is this out here?

3047
02:12:30,541 --> 02:12:31,141
I mean,
mind you,

3048
02:12:31,141 --> 02:12:32,610
it's the road I live off of.
I'm like,

3049
02:12:32,611 --> 02:12:33,870
oh,
what road is this out here?

3050
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,670
So anyway,
so we're like,

3051
02:12:35,671 --> 02:12:36,540
oh good.
Okay.

3052
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:37,261
Thank you.
Sure,

3053
02:12:37,261 --> 02:12:38,094
and so we

3054
02:12:38,100 --> 02:12:42,210
get back in the car and the cops gone,
so we backed out and head back down the

3055
02:12:42,211 --> 02:12:45,320
road again,
trying to get further away from the stop

3056
02:12:45,321 --> 02:12:46,530
light,
make a left.

3057
02:12:46,531 --> 02:12:48,990
I look over in the parking lot across
the street,

3058
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:52,350
the grade school parking lot cops
sitting there.

3059
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:56,760
So I make the first right I can then.
So I turned right into a neighborhood

3060
02:12:56,761 --> 02:12:58,980
and I'm driving along and he finally
catches me in.

3061
02:12:59,030 --> 02:13:01,250
I,
I think I cried to help me.

3062
02:13:01,410 --> 02:13:05,270
He didn't turn his lights on.
So when you were running from him kinda

3063
02:13:05,440 --> 02:13:08,030
[inaudible] this guy,
it sounds like a shitty driver,

3064
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:09,470
like a shitty cop,

3065
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:11,980
but I think I got in trouble for being
sideways.

3066
02:13:11,981 --> 02:13:14,680
Not for speeding.
Yeah.

3067
02:13:14,681 --> 02:13:15,470
You should say

3068
02:13:15,470 --> 02:13:16,920
yes.
So your friend's car.

3069
02:13:16,921 --> 02:13:18,720
I don't even know how to drive this
thing,

3070
02:13:19,950 --> 02:13:22,370
ben.
Actually a clever approach.

3071
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:24,060
Yeah,
yeah,

3072
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:24,700
yeah.
just say,

3073
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:27,830
I don't know what happened.
I hit the gas and one side was my

3074
02:13:27,840 --> 02:13:30,220
getting pulled over three times in three
days episodes.

3075
02:13:30,221 --> 02:13:32,040
So that was number three.

3076
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,950
I think I cried.
Maybe it was number two.

3077
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:36,540
So is that why you were running from the
cops?

3078
02:13:36,541 --> 02:13:37,320
liquor.
I just can't.

3079
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:40,020
I can't keep doing this.
I was just trying to see if I can

3080
02:13:42,180 --> 02:13:44,670
get away.
Well,

3081
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:46,890
danica,
I think I've kept you long enough.

3082
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:49,620
It was really wonderful to talk to you.
I really appreciate it.

3083
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:52,320
It was really fun.
I wish you all the best of luck with

3084
02:13:52,321 --> 02:13:55,950
your wine and your clothes and your last
two races and uh,

3085
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:57,600
it was a pleasure.
Thank you.

3086
02:13:57,690 --> 02:14:02,130
So nice to talk to you about the whole
car situation next year and next year

3087
02:14:02,131 --> 02:14:03,420
you're going to want to get something
crazy.

3088
02:14:03,421 --> 02:14:04,830
I guarantee you,
once you're done,

3089
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:06,720
when I tell you I'm,
I'm a,

3090
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:09,330
I'm missing the action.
I'll let you just call the car.

3091
02:14:09,331 --> 02:14:11,220
I should buy it.
Sounds like a plan.

3092
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:13,200
Danica patrick.
Ladies and gentlemen.
