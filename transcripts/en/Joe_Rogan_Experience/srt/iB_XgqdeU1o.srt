1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,590
Yes.
And we're live.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,030
Hello,
Danica Patrick.

3
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,560
Hi.
Welcome to the show.

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,790
Thank you.
Thanks for doing this.

5
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:08,710
I appreciate it.
I'm excited to be here.

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
You're an intense lady.
You've got a lot of intensity when I met

7
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:12,910
you like right away I'm like,
whoa.

8
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,100
Got to take this one in.

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:15,831
Well,
you know,

10
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:19,490
it's the handshake and then it's the uh,
you know when someone actually looks you

11
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:19,970
in the eye.

12
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,360
Well you have to be intense.
I mean what you do for living is

13
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,840
probably one of the craziest things a
human being can do.

14
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,380
Do you think so it's up there for a job.
How fast you go?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,370
Uh,
200.

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,540
Yeah,
I mean like,

17
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,230
you know,
Nascar's top speed is probably two 15

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,700
indy cars and maybe more like two 40.
And I'm going to do the Daytona 500 next

19
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,830
month and then the indy 500 in May.
So,

20
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,260
um,
those are going to be my last two races.

21
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,200
So,
um,

22
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,570
the last one's ever,
yeah.

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,673
Really?
Yeah,

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,370
it's a,
this is my Danica double goodbye tour.

25
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,790
Why are you doing that?
How come you doing a Danica Double

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,920
Goodbye Cook?
Is it enough is enough.

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,500
I'm ready.
Um,

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,790
I mean I love racing,
but I love other things too.

29
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,020
So,
um,

30
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,260
you know,
I'm okay with transitioning out and

31
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:10,630
there was a lot of things that were kind
of just pointing me in this direction.

32
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,080
Yeah.
In 2017 stuff that has never happened to

33
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:15,880
me before.
Um,

34
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,590
to kind of,
yeah.

35
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,780
Head towards the exit a little bit,
but I'm good with that.

36
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,690
I'm a very decisive person,
so,

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,460
um,
this is probably one of them that I

38
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:25,930
thought about a little bit,
um,

39
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:29,230
as far as like how to be done or,
or if to be done I guess.

40
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:30,490
But,
um,

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,550
the how was the hardest part?
My agent kept calling and saying,

42
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,410
what about this and what if you did
that?

43
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:36,310
And I'm like,
no,

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,140
no,
no.

45
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,270
You all need to get ready for me to be
done,

46
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,350
please.
Wow.

47
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,011
And,
uh,

48
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,870
so then he came up with the,
it's like,

49
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,720
what if you finish up at the,
at Daytona for the 500?

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,570
And I was like,
what about the indy 500?

51
00:01:49,571 --> 00:01:51,490
And he goes,
and I was really only referring to the

52
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:52,630
indy 500.
And he was like,

53
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:54,520
well I'd,
I'd love you to do both.

54
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,120
And I was like,
oh well that's a good idea.

55
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,020
So,
um,

56
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,550
there's this thing in racing called the
double,

57
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:03,240
which is doing the indy 500,
um,

58
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,970
on Memorial Day weekend on Sunday and
then flying straight to charlotte to do

59
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:09,910
the coke 600 afterwards.
And that's kind of known as the double.

60
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,130
Um,
but this is what we're calling the

61
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,800
Danica double and it has to do with just
having spent,

62
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,720
you know,
a chunk of my career in Indycar and a

63
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,690
chunk of my career in Nascar and it just
kinda feels like the right way to go

64
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,441
out.
I don't know.

65
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:21,101
It didn't,
it did,

66
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:23,830
it wasn't clear.
It was a bit of a murky end as far as

67
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,030
like,
what's going to happen?

68
00:02:25,031 --> 00:02:27,340
Am I going to race next year full time
or not?

69
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:31,570
And it just kind of went suit too long
for me to have like a proper,

70
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm done sort of moment in my head.
So this was just a great way to do it.

71
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,830
So when you say that things happen in
2017 that didn't happen before?

72
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,903
Like what do you mean?

73
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,760
I got a sponsor leave me.
Uh,

74
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,920
my primary sponsor left at the beginning
of the year.

75
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,100
I may not,
I signed a contract it when mercury was

76
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,120
in retrograde,
so,

77
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,500
you know,
I screwed myself there.

78
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,800
But that stuff don't know.
I don't know.

79
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,270
It was true.
So,

80
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,750
um,
I guess maybe the universe is a little

81
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,240
bit straight

82
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,760
forward than we think it is.
A lot of good things probably happened

83
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,930
during that time just in 2017 or during
Richard,

84
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,230
Shereen Mercury in retrograde.
I don't,

85
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,690
I don't believe in any of that shit.
Oh yeah.

86
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,020
I think people look for some sort of
like hidden meaning to things when it

87
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,790
comes to like astrology.

88
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,923
Yeah.
Yeah.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,920
I do try and understand it.
It's quite,

90
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,460
I'm trying to understand how it really
matters,

91
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,330
but I don't know.
There's definitely some things,

92
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:31,060
at least with the moon that goes on.
I mean the water changes with the moon,

93
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,260
so doesn't that mean that other thing
should too,

94
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,770
whether it be energetically or something
like that?

95
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,380
I think the the water and the moon thing
kind of makes sense a little bit.

96
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,380
A little bit,
but I think it's probably just like

97
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,770
barely one way or the other.
Just still,

98
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,490
maybe it's a whisper on the wind kind of
stuff.

99
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,820
I think it's more in your head.
So stop putting my crystals outside of

100
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,980
charge under the full moon.
Maybe not so important.

101
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,070
I would say it's not that important.
There was some something someone sent me

102
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,440
about the army using crystals and I was
like,

103
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,930
this has gotta be like an onion article
that the rn,

104
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,400
the army was using crystals for like
medic seat thing.

105
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,820
If you could see it,
find that.

106
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,980
Define it.
Yeah.

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,400
This store for wounded people.
Yeah.

108
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:12,080
Look at this stupid shit.
I don't even,

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,850
I don't,
I'm not sure if it's real.

110
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,970
US Army's new holistic medics treating
gunshot wounds with crystals and

111
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,430
essential oils is satire.
Thank you.

112
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,630
Thank you.
I knew essential oils.

113
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,970
Don't you think there's a plant that
cures everything out there?

114
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,250
There probably is something like that in
the Amazon.

115
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,540
Maybe not cures everything,
but this is probably a lot of stuff that

116
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,140
we oils come from,
right?

117
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:37,100
Yeah.
So pair that up with some high

118
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:40,340
vibrational stones,
high vibrational stones.

119
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:40,960
Ooh,
no,

120
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,040
no tents.
So,

121
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,450
um,
back to back to my sponsor leaving me.

122
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,840
You sponsor leaving you,
you will like,

123
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:48,470
that's it.
Yeah.

124
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,170
It's just a,
never happened to me before.

125
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:53,710
I've always been someone that's been
really well funded and I always had a

126
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,740
sponsor,
always had a sponsor and never a

127
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:57,850
problem.
And so,

128
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,050
um,
yeah,

129
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:00,520
it was just things like that were
happening.

130
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:04,780
I got an a few big wrecks in a row,
like probably three and six weeks that

131
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:05,614
were,
Ooh,

132
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,020
you know,
like I was bawling in the medical center

133
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:09,510
after the third one going,
whoa.

134
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,260
I mean,
I was running like top 10,

135
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:15,370
and a car blew a rotor and clipped me
and put me in the wall.

136
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:18,670
I was on fire up.
Another driver broke his back.

137
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,470
I mean,
it was a huge accident.

138
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,580
And I'm like,
what is,

139
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,520
what is the message?
What is someone trying to tell me right

140
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:25,354
now?
And so,

141
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,090
you know,
after I collected my shit and got my

142
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,970
face looking like halfway decent to go
talk to the media out there,

143
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,650
I finally got out.
But yeah,

144
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:34,900
just stuff like that was happening and I
was,

145
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,960
I was in a very go with the flow mood in
2017 I wasn't pushing for anything cause

146
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:43,120
I wasn't really sure what I wanted so I
just let the universe take care of it.

147
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,840
You've got a very interesting way of
looking at things.

148
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,820
You when things go wrong,
you're like,

149
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:51,180
what is the universe trying to tell me?
You're not like,

150
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:53,790
well I drive really fucking fast for a
living.

151
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,940
Sometimes shit goes wrong.
That's happens to I,

152
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,123
it seems like

153
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,240
car racing is just inherently crazy.
I mean it's what I was saying when I was

154
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:05,720
saying you do one of the craziest things
you can for a living going 240 miles an

155
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,470
hour is no joke.
Yeah.

156
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:10,370
And metal and rubber and things just,

157
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,480
yeah,
trust in something when you're out there

158
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:14,920
because you're doing,
like you said,

159
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,930
200 plus miles an hour with,
you know,

160
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,030
people that aren't your friends around
you with walls around you as well.

161
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,700
So you know,
you kind of got to put your trust in

162
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:25,534
something else.

163
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,110
Yeah.
That's why I was getting at that because

164
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:30,260
I think the way you think is the,
a lot,

165
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,430
it's very similar to the way fighter
pilots think.

166
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,290
Fighter pilots have a lot of weird
superstitions and a lot of,

167
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:37,550
uh,
a lot of pilots do,

168
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:39,410
a lot of people that are involved in
intense things.

169
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:43,910
It's almost like in order to get through
the,

170
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:48,080
the task at hand,
you almost have to delegate certain

171
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:52,740
aspects of reality to fate or to chance
or to,

172
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,650
yeah,

173
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,610
I believe that.
Yeah.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,380
I mean they,
uh,

175
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,750
have a tattoo on my back,
one of his in America,

176
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,820
it's an American flag.
I got that when I was 19.

177
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,250
It's like an American flag that fades to
a checkered flag.

178
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:06,790
And then there's a,
and then I got that when I was 19.

179
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,070
Then when I was about 27,
I went and got the rest,

180
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:09,850
which was,
um,

181
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,820
Angel Wings and some stars.
And you know,

182
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,830
it's not the most beautiful piece of
art,

183
00:07:14,831 --> 00:07:18,910
but it means something to me.
It won't be really beautiful in 30

184
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,220
years,
I'm sure 40 um,

185
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,020
but it's,
uh,

186
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,990
but yeah,
I am,

187
00:07:22,991 --> 00:07:25,660
my point is,
is that I would definitely pray that,

188
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:27,340
you know,
I was taken care of and you've got to

189
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:32,341
hand that off and just go do your damn
job and not be afraid and just trust in

190
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:34,240
the fate of everything.
And Yeah.

191
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:35,390
So that's kind of where the angel links,

192
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,360
well,
I think that people that do inherently

193
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:43,361
risky things oftentimes look for signs
or look for some sort of,

194
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,320
you know,
some direction,

195
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,900
some,
some message from the university.

196
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,943
And that's why I was,

197
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,260
well,
I mean,

198
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,290
I feel like as a race car driver,
I've thought about this a lot lately and

199
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:58,291
I wonder how much of our job is a little
less even just feeling what's happening

200
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:01,090
and how much is actually maybe more
intuitive.

201
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,260
Like,
maybe we're,

202
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,730
maybe we're having more intuitive
understanding of what's going on and

203
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:10,210
what's coming.
Then we realize we just are so,

204
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:14,050
um,
everything's happening so fast and that

205
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,800
you,
you,

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,640
you just think,
oh,

207
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:16,930
I'm,
I have really good feel.

208
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:17,920
You know,
I mean,

209
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,560
I'm sure there's some of that too.
But um,

210
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:25,480
so I think that maybe maybe you're maybe
maybe athletes or people at an elite

211
00:08:25,481 --> 00:08:28,870
level are more in touch with that
intuitive side that um,

212
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,050
finite like last thread of feel.
Maybe it's beyond feel.

213
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,683
It's a knowing

214
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,930
that makes sense.
I mean,

215
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,170
if you think about the amount of time
that you've spent involved in that

216
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:43,930
intense activity in this,
you know,

217
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,800
they say that people get road rage for
one of the reasons why people get road

218
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:52,801
rage is because when you're driving you
are reacting to things that could happen

219
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,940
instantaneously very quickly.
So your at a very heightened state and

220
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,980
people,
you know,

221
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,910
someone cuts you off,
you,

222
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,310
they start freaking out.
Like instantly they go from one to 10

223
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,710
right away.
And the reason is because they're always

224
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,780
at seven and they don't even realize
they're at seven.

225
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:10,680
When you were in the car,
you're probably at like 13.

226
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,960
This one goes to 11.

227
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,890
Yeah.
You,

228
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,180
I mean you're cranked up.
Right.

229
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:19,010
And so you're probably seeing things and
feeling things at the average person.

230
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,750
Yeah.
They don't experience in their life.

231
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,470
Yeah.
You're just working at that top little

232
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,950
top level of
feeling of,

233
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,280
of um,
focus.

234
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,900
Okay.

235
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,970
Was that,
is that where you call it in the zone?

236
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,280
Yeah.
Where it kind of almost becomes slightly

237
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,380
out of body.
You don't know how it's happening.

238
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,214
It's just happening.

239
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,160
Why would imagine like you kind of melt
away and you're just coming.

240
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,073
Yeah.
We involved,

241
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,340
when I think about what I have to do,
like let's say as an example coming in

242
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,980
for a pit stop and you got your throttle
brake,

243
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:56,320
clutch gears,
all the different things that you have

244
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:57,450
to do,
um,

245
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,490
to think about it logically,
what you have to do is so much more

246
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:03,730
confusing than just going on instinct of
like just do it.

247
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,280
Um,
cause you have to,

248
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,330
you know,
use,

249
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,700
you only have two feet but you have
three pedals and you have to use all

250
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:13,000
three pedals at some point in time.
But you want to be ready for everything

251
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,490
and you,
you're coming in like what the clutch in

252
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,620
on the break.
But then you have to get back to the,

253
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,870
get to the,
get to the throttle just in time.

254
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:22,480
But you have to have the clutch in and
you have to hold the brakes so you make

255
00:10:22,481 --> 00:10:24,130
sure you don't roll.
There's all kinds of things you have to

256
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:25,960
do using all three pedals,
which you have two feet.

257
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:28,330
And so when you kind of,
when you have to think about what you

258
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:29,980
have to do,
it's a little more overwhelming than

259
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,440
just doing it.
Do you drive a manual in real life?

260
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,820
I would.
I love it.

261
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,590
Easy.
Yeah,

262
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,423
I do too.

263
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,170
Yeah.
But I mean a lot of people,

264
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,030
it seems like it's kind of a dying
thing.

265
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,050
Yeah,
it is.

266
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,870
I mean even indy cars went to paddle
shifting before I was done,

267
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:46,080
it was h pattern and then it was
sequential gearbox.

268
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,790
And then it was paddle shifting and
then,

269
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,250
but Nascar,
Nascar is still still got the old h

270
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:53,160
pattern.
That left leg is important for the whole

271
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,480
feel of the thing.
Right?

272
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,100
Well,
especially in an indy car,

273
00:10:56,101 --> 00:10:58,260
in any car,
you actually have a full on dead pedal.

274
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,080
So you have all three pedals and then
you have a dead pedal,

275
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:03,780
which is,
is important because you spend a lot of

276
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:06,810
time with your foot there.
But it is part of the feel.

277
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,790
It is absolutely part of the feel of the
car,

278
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:12,210
especially with all the g loads.
How did you get involved in racing?

279
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,460
I raced go karts when I was a kid.
Um,

280
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,260
my sister and my sister wanted to race
go carts and I just didn't want to get

281
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,630
left out.
So it turned out I was all right.

282
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:23,030
It and I kept going.
But it's,

283
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,210
it's a very unusual path.
Yeah.

284
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,670
Well,
I mean I did everything though.

285
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:28,980
I was a,
I played like coach pitch,

286
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,050
then tee ball.
I was in the band,

287
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:33,840
the choir,
I took voice lessons.

288
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:35,910
I was,
I played basketball,

289
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,560
volleyball,
cheerleading,

290
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,200
um,
I played in every sport.

291
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
Um,
I took tumbling classes and then I also

292
00:11:43,681 --> 00:11:45,480
tried racing.
So you've always been intense?

293
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,980
Yeah.
Yeah,

294
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:47,814
for sure.

295
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,610
Did you know at a certain age that you
wanted to be a race car driver?

296
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:51,860
Well,
when I was 10,

297
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:55,660
I decided that I wanted to go to college
for engineering so I could learn how to

298
00:11:55,661 --> 00:11:58,870
work on my race car.
And I realize I did not have to do that.

299
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,370
I did not.
Okay.

300
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,360
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

301
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,200
Wow.
I didn't have to do that.

302
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,790
Be An engineer so that you could work on
your race card.

303
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,450
Do you know,
do you understand how crazy that is?

304
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,250
When I was going to be 10 years old to
three thinking that,

305
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:11,084
well,

306
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,613
I dunno.

307
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,410
Do you think you're born that way or am
I an old?

308
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
Like what do you think about that?
Like to be thinking that way when I'm 10

309
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:21,394
years old,
like you,

310
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,890
you know,
some people are just so much different

311
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,200
or more mature further along.
Is it,

312
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,570
um,
why do you think that is?

313
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,120
It's a very good question.
I don't,

314
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,280
I think it's entirely possible that
memory gets transferred through DNA and

315
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:40,590
that there are certain people that have
a long line of adventurous people and

316
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:44,020
their family and that gets transferred
to the DNA of the children.

317
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,920
I think it's entirely possible.
I have,

318
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,200
I have three children,
not a spiritual reincarnation.

319
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,690
No,
maybe.

320
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:51,501
I mean,
look,

321
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:52,190
it's,
that's it.

322
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,140
That's entirely possible too.
I would never,

323
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,920
I would never say no to that because if
you're living this life,

324
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,720
I mean,
nobody asked to live this life.

325
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:00,590
You just here,
right?

326
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,710
Who knows if you get to do it again,
I mean we're,

327
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:06,410
we're assuming that you don't get to do
it again because we're assuming that

328
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,130
time goes on this sort of linear way,
but maybe it just does for you in this

329
00:13:10,131 --> 00:13:12,560
life,
it's entirely possible that there's

330
00:13:12,561 --> 00:13:14,920
infinite number of lives being lived out
in,

331
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:18,140
in infinite timelines,
all simultaneously.

332
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,020
We're just experiencing this one and we
don't even know what happens when we

333
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:22,310
sleep.
You go to sleep,

334
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,310
close your eyes.
If for some crazy dream about Godzilla

335
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:26,750
chasing you,
you're on a skateboard.

336
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,620
You wake up in the morning and you just
assume that you're on the same timeline

337
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:32,360
that you were on before,
you know,

338
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:35,330
because you have done the astro,
who knows?

339
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,650
I don't,
you know,

340
00:13:36,651 --> 00:13:39,140
I have children.
And then one of the things that's really

341
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:42,470
fascinating about watching a child
develop from a baby to,

342
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,680
you know,
a kid and see their personalities.

343
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,870
Like you realize like there's a lot of
stuff that's just,

344
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,370
that's what they come with.

345
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,360
Yeah.
They're just,

346
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,770
that's what I'm saying.
So it's,

347
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,290
they're just different.
Why,

348
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:54,190
you know,
why,

349
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,220
why was I thinking about being an
engineer when I was 10 years old?

350
00:13:57,221 --> 00:14:01,090
Why was I brave enough to go live in
England by myself when I was 16 and all

351
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,290
good with it?
And you know,

352
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,910
why,
why,

353
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,460
why,
why am I in tent?

354
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,260
Why did,
why was I intense when you met me?

355
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,903
You know what I mean?

356
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,080
Well,
I think part of your intensity is

357
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:14,210
probably,
if I had to guess,

358
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,890
if I could be presumptuous,
your a woman involved in a very manly

359
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:23,570
activity and I'm sure men probably test
you in some sort of a weird way.

360
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,870
And so I bet along the way you've
developed this sort of like way of

361
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:31,900
addressing them right away,
like a listen motherfucker

362
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,303
sometimes.

363
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,830
Yeah.
I mean I think you probably have to,

364
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,641
you know,
I would imagine,

365
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:37,810
yeah,

366
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,090
to be strong you have to,
I remember when I was younger and going

367
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:44,830
to meetings with companies or team
bosses,

368
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,890
people like that and was the advice
given was don't say,

369
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,050
oh I this and may be like,
you'd be sure about what you want.

370
00:14:54,051 --> 00:14:55,730
And I remember that.
So,

371
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,470
yeah,
in nature versus nurture,

372
00:14:57,471 --> 00:14:59,350
some of it's learned,
but some of it's just there.

373
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,240
Yeah.
You can't turn a timid person to you.

374
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,870
Maybe you could,
but I mean,

375
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,180
it's not,
not likely you would,

376
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,600
you seem to be like this person.
This is just who you are.

377
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,300
If you're telling me that at 10 years
old you were thinking about being an

378
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,910
engineer so you could work on race cars.
That's not normal.

379
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,620
Well,
what's normal though?

380
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,150
What'd you want to do when you were 10
years old?

381
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,150
I had no idea.
I probably wanted to be an artist.

382
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,150
I think I wanted to be an artist.
I mean that,

383
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,430
that follows this vein sort of.
Yeah.

384
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,380
But like I used to want to draw comic
books.

385
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,480
I did a lot of that.
Yeah.

386
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,940
So that was probably what I wanted,
but I was never like,

387
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,480
well I need to do is like I need to
figure out a way to make my hand

388
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,610
stronger so that I draw faster.
And I like

389
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,270
Steven Mind,
I did not go to college.

390
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,770
In fact,
I didn't even finish high school.

391
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,940
You didn't at all?
Nope.

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,990
I left when I was 16 and I got my ged.
Wow.

393
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,000
And I failed the first time.
Wow.

394
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,990
You want to know why?
Yeah.

395
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,863
Okay,
good.

396
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,700
Um,
cause that's like a horrible,

397
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:58,280
like I failed my ged.
Oh Geez.

398
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,910
Um,
I uh,

399
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,080
the constitution test is something,
at least in Illinois,

400
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:05,300
I don't know if you have to pass it in
every state,

401
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:08,270
but in Illinois you do.
And so in eighth grade to go to high

402
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:12,560
school you have to get a 70% or above to
go to high school.

403
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,080
I got a 70,
so I went to high school.

404
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,140
Now I'm like a 3.5 and above student.
Like I was a's and b's not a problem for

405
00:16:20,511 --> 00:16:23,420
some reason.
The constitution and government and all

406
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:27,230
of those sectors and names and holy
moly,

407
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,240
it's so confusing to me.
So,

408
00:16:29,241 --> 00:16:31,040
um,
so then when it came time to,

409
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,540
to do my,
take my ged,

410
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:36,860
I didn't study at all.
I just took the test and I failed the

411
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:40,210
constitution test.
So I prepare for it.

412
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:40,851
That's all.
Yeah.

413
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:41,540
I mean,
I,

414
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,170
I've never studied in my life so I just
no.

415
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,530
Okay.

416
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,400
Really?
Yeah.

417
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,760
[inaudible] the only thing I study up,
well study,

418
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,830
uh,
if I'm doing a speech,

419
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,380
uh,
or if I'm doing something for a,

420
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,180
for a company,
for a sponsor,

421
00:16:57,181 --> 00:17:00,360
and I need to make sure that I have my
talking points ready.

422
00:17:00,361 --> 00:17:03,870
I mean,
I spent 15 minutes or 30 minutes or five

423
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:07,290
minutes making sure that I'm organized
in my head about what it is that I need

424
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,420
to get out there so that I can do my
job,

425
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,830
um,
and deliver.

426
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,350
But other than that,
I never studied in school.

427
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,620
Keep in mind,
I didn't have to go to school that long.

428
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:18,990
I never even,
I mean I only went to school until I was

429
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:20,940
16,
so it's been a really,

430
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:22,920
really,
really long time since I went to school.

431
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,660
But you're very smart.
Oh,

432
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:25,441
I don't know.
See,

433
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:27,000
I,
I know you're smart.

434
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:27,834
Thank you.
Well,

435
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,210
what do you do you read?
Um,

436
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,450
I actually,
I want to start reading more.

437
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,980
I've got a lot of books that I want to
read.

438
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:37,530
I started reading a book called the
Holographic universe.

439
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,730
Okay.
Michael Talbot,

440
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:39,360
right?
Yeah.

441
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,200
Yeah.
It's a good book.

442
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,700
Is that it's weird.
Yeah.

443
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,930
There's a lot of stuff in there.
You're like,

444
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,700
wait a minute.
This kind of drugs like,

445
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:46,380
cause usually there's a lot of woo in
there.

446
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:47,214
I think

447
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,650
I'm a little woo.
So it's good.

448
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,050
I,
I'm in simple books like the alchemists

449
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,760
and stuff.
I just really want to read these books.

450
00:17:53,761 --> 00:17:55,260
I mean,
and um,

451
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:56,390
yeah.
Uh,

452
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,030
she does more woo woo woo woo shit.
Yeah,

453
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,850
I am.
Why do you think that that is the race

454
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,920
car thing?
Do you think that's like the has nothing

455
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:07,080
to do with it's just who you are.
That's just who I am.

456
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,190
I remember getting a psychic reading
when I was 18 years old living in

457
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,040
England.
Yeah.

458
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,100
Yeah.
I bought like Linda Goodman's love

459
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:19,620
science like astrology book when I was a
kid.

460
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,920
So when you were 16 and you got a
psychic reading man,

461
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:24,880
I totally had a mood ring.
Oh,

462
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,500
mood rings are great.
Sorry,

463
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,330
go ahead.
Do what did what did they tell you?

464
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:29,800
They tell you anything you don't
remember.

465
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,510
I can't remember.
But when I was talking about signing my

466
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,540
contract and um,
or when mercury was in retrograde,

467
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,080
that was,
I,

468
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,320
I talked to an astrologer and she said,
just don't sign any contracts.

469
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:41,390
And I was like,
well what a bizarre,

470
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:44,960
I mean I was kind of learning about some
of this stuff cause it was quite a few

471
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,360
years ago now,
but I,

472
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,920
um,
I remember the next day,

473
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:50,630
it was a year and a half later,
so,

474
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,090
and you know,
the shit hit the fan and I was like,

475
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,000
that damn astrologer was right now.
Okay.

476
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:59,630
Mercury retrogrades pretty standard
information if you're into strategy at

477
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:00,260
all.
But,

478
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,730
um,
but yeah,

479
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:02,980
she said,
uh,

480
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,580
I saw a psychic in Sedona a few years
ago and she said that professionally

481
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,740
over the next four years,
your life's gonna go boom,

482
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:10,161
boom,
boom,

483
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:10,581
boom,
boom.

484
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:11,211
And I thought,
man,

485
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:13,340
I'm going to win a bunch of races,
is going to be awesome.

486
00:19:13,341 --> 00:19:15,350
And instead I,
um,

487
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,080
uh,
have clothing line now.

488
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,160
Um,
I have a book that just came out at the

489
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,741
beginning of the year.
Uh,

490
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,310
my wines finally been for sale for a
year now.

491
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,350
Um,
and there's other projects I'm working

492
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:28,730
on too,
but uh,

493
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,400
and you know,
finishing off my career in a pretty big

494
00:19:31,401 --> 00:19:33,230
way.
So I guess she was right.

495
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,610
I think that lady's full of Shit.
You think so?

496
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,280
I think she looked at you and like,
this chick's gonna kick ass.

497
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,580
Do you think she recognized me?
Then she's like,

498
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:41,630
okay.
So when I sat down,

499
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:42,560
she was like,
all right,

500
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:46,430
the way it works here is like,
I just see words or symbols or things

501
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:49,310
around you.
So if I just look around like don't

502
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:51,830
think I'm not paying attention to him,
that's just how I see things.

503
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:52,664
And so I'm like,
all right,

504
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,260
all right.
So I'm sitting there and she's telling

505
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,480
me all this stuff and she says whatever
my job is,

506
00:19:56,481 --> 00:20:00,020
I travel a lot and things like that.
And then she all of a sudden kind of was

507
00:20:00,021 --> 00:20:00,771
looking at me.
She looked over,

508
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:02,930
she goes,
celebrities are you a celebrity?

509
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,110
And I was like,
I only am if you think I am.

510
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,660
Just usually how I answer people.
Um,

511
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:11,780
so I don't know.
Did she know who I was up in Sedona?

512
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:13,250
They don't watch a lot of TV.
I don't think.

513
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,560
You don't think so?
No.

514
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,180
They snake

515
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,090
and when no one's looking at their lunch
break areas,

516
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:22,760
just you know,
the rest of crystals on the TV.

517
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,660
I just think he's sending positive
vibes.

518
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,440
Almost all bullshit.
I think almost call psychic stuff is

519
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:33,140
bullshit.
I think you don't believe in the being

520
00:20:33,141 --> 00:20:35,600
intuitive intuition is a different
thing.

521
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,670
I think when people sit down and they
go,

522
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:40,850
I see you in a past life and you are
handmade and you,

523
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,890
you,
you work by the river,

524
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,470
get the fuck outta here.
I think that's all bullshit.

525
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,040
I think those people are nuts and
there's a lot

526
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,440
of people that want to think they're
special and they want to think that they

527
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:52,600
have special gifts in there.
Everybody does.

528
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,430
People get really good at reading
people.

529
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:59,431
I know people who are professional
magicians and they are expert cold

530
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:01,300
readers.
I could sit down with you and breed and

531
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,990
tell you remarkable amounts of things
with your,

532
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,760
about your life,
just with your answers to questions,

533
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,550
but they'll tell you right away.
They're not psychic.

534
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:11,710
Like there's a guy named bandit check
who's excellent at it.

535
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,080
He's fantastic.
He does a show in Vegas and he freaks

536
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:15,790
people out because he'll tell you right
away,

537
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,650
I am not a psychic.
He's like,

538
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,170
this is a,
there's techniques to this and it's

539
00:21:20,171 --> 00:21:23,380
something I've been doing my whole life,
and you just get really good at it and

540
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:26,890
he knows how to do it.
And these people are con artists.

541
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,940
They're,
they're con artists.

542
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,760
They trick you into thinking that they
have,

543
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,600
but they might even believe it
themselves.

544
00:21:31,601 --> 00:21:34,270
That's part of the problem.
A lot of those people calm themselves,

545
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,440
but I think there is something like when
you're thinking about someone and they

546
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:40,640
call you like out of nowhere and you
haven't talked,

547
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,000
the prevalence of synchronicities that
pop up in your life,

548
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:43,511
you're like,
oh my God,

549
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,730
I was thinking about that movie and
there it is on TV.

550
00:21:45,731 --> 00:21:45,980
Yeah.

551
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,980
It's entirely possible that there is
some bizarre connection that we don't

552
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,910
totally understand to events into people
and into things

553
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,580
well like attracts like or where
attention goes,

554
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:00,870
energy flows.

555
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,270
Yeah.
There's probably a lot to that.

556
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,180
Certain magnetism to those two things
that bring it together.

557
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,140
Yes,
maybe,

558
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,970
but I think it's very,
very poorly understood and there's a lot

559
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:17,500
of woo that's clouding it up and that
woo gets in the way of rational,

560
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,570
logical,
educated people.

561
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:22,810
Even considering it,
they dismiss it instantaneously because

562
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:25,300
it's connected to somebody,
assholes with neon signs.

563
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:27,040
It's a card reader,
palm reader,

564
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,620
and these people that just,
they're just ripping you off.

565
00:22:29,621 --> 00:22:31,360
That's all they're doing.
They don't have a real job.

566
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:34,030
They sit down,
they talk to people for a job and you

567
00:22:34,031 --> 00:22:35,350
know,
you could say it's entertainment.

568
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,040
He could say that what they're doing is
they're providing you with a service

569
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,660
that serves as they sit down with you
and,

570
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,990
and maybe by telling you that
everything's going to be amazing.

571
00:22:43,991 --> 00:22:47,050
You'll walk out of there with a lot of
enthusiasm and then life will be

572
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:48,320
amazing.
Who knows?

573
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,290
You believe that if you think your
life's going to be amazing,

574
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,430
it will be no,
no.

575
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:54,430
You get hit by a meteor given me a lot
kind of the house.

576
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,040
You could fall into a crack in the
ground from an earthquake.

577
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:58,750
I mean,
well those people that died in the

578
00:22:58,751 --> 00:23:01,150
tsunami in Thailand did,
were they bad people?

579
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:01,820
No.

580
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,120
There was there any level of Wu that's
worth following through on?

581
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,940
I think it's all things.
I think some,

582
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,500
some of the connections and the
intuition and some superstitions and

583
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:17,880
ideas that we have are probably based in
this limited understanding that we have

584
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,390
in the connection that we have two
events and humans in life.

585
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,780
But I think there's also bullshit
involved too.

586
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:28,380
And all these things get very cloudy.
I don't think there's an absolute,

587
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,270
but I think it's,
it's entirely possible that intuition is

588
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,200
a developing sense that we don't totally
have yet.

589
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,320
I think if you think about all the
things that people can do,

590
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,010
hearing and seeing and touching and
smelling and all the different senses

591
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:44,910
that we have,
we,

592
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,140
that that covers the full gamut of
possibilities.

593
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:49,220
But I don't think that's true.

594
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,040
No,
no,

595
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,220
I think you're right.
And I mean,

596
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,530
even just visually,
you know,

597
00:23:53,531 --> 00:23:56,800
we don't see the full spectrum of what
we see a very,

598
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:59,470
very small amount of things that are out
there.

599
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,360
Yeah.
And our audio as well,

600
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,130
you know,
we can't hear all the sounds.

601
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:03,941
Yeah.
I mean,

602
00:24:03,941 --> 00:24:06,080
since it's entirely possible that
there's more going,

603
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,320
like there's certain people that just
have a weird feel to them.

604
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,220
You meet him,
you're like,

605
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,570
I just gotta get away from this guy.
Yeah.

606
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,770
Yeah.
There's,

607
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:16,150
there's definitely people that they're
giving off weird feelings and it could

608
00:24:16,151 --> 00:24:21,151
be that your reading their intent and
some sort of a way that you don't see

609
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:22,330
visually,
but you,

610
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:25,650
you're recognized by their body language
or it could be a bunch of things.

611
00:24:25,651 --> 00:24:25,800
Yeah.

612
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,790
Plead and run when you met me.
So no,

613
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,050
I appreciate that.
And I know we're probably scheduled to

614
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:30,920
do this interview so you can

615
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,910
couldn't,
but I was looking forward to this.

616
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,520
Why would I run,
I mean I was,

617
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,730
I was impressed by your intensity,
but I expected that in a way.

618
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,250
I mean I just,
I don't see how you could be a race car

619
00:24:41,251 --> 00:24:44,280
driver and not be anti,
especially be a woman and a race car

620
00:24:44,281 --> 00:24:45,360
driver and not be in touch.

621
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,200
Well that's nothing I even thought about
until I was like 14.

622
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,840
Um,
for the first few ways,

623
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:52,300
abrasive,
way late in life,

624
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,550
think about being a girl out there.
It wasn't until I had cameras following

625
00:24:56,551 --> 00:24:58,860
me around my schools and stuff that I
was like,

626
00:24:58,861 --> 00:24:59,730
all right,
maybe this is,

627
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,560
and then they start asking you about it.
They're like,

628
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:02,820
what's it like to be a girl?
You're like,

629
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:03,571
Shit.
And originally,

630
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,220
I don't know really.
I haven't really thought about that.

631
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,020
Um,
how many other girls do it?

632
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,110
I mean,
there are various girls here and there,

633
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:10,940
but

634
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,670
like in all of Nascar,
how many women are right or racing?

635
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,100
Oh,
I'm at my level,

636
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,700
not,
yes.

637
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,750
Zero.
Yeah.

638
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,040
That's crazy.
Huh?

639
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,110
That's pretty crazy.
I Dunno.

640
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,110
Yeah.
That's crazy.

641
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,750
Wow.
Take it from me.

642
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,780
I'm the last year.
What's it like to be a girl in racing?

643
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:26,381
I'm like,
ah,

644
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:27,790
well,
I don't really know what it's like to be

645
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:28,630
a guy.
So,

646
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:31,030
you know,
I only have my perspective.

647
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,260
That's true.
You know,

648
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,031
I mean,
I don't know,

649
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:36,100
like being a girl versus a guy.
What's the difference?

650
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,050
I don't know.
What's it like to be a guy?

651
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:39,771
Uh,
yeah,

652
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:42,770
it probably be different,
but I think that like,

653
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:47,771
what's it like to be a woman that's the
only woman who's in Nascar at your

654
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:49,694
level?
That's,

655
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,230
that's a valid question.
I mean,

656
00:25:51,231 --> 00:25:52,330
that's crazy.
How does,

657
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,660
how does everybody else treat you?

658
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,891
Yeah.
That,

659
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:56,840
that,
that really is the main question.

660
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:59,280
I can't answer because I'm not them.
And I write,

661
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,770
I know that,
um,

662
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,740
from,
from enough experience now,

663
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:05,210
because I used to not really look into
it much.

664
00:26:05,211 --> 00:26:08,300
And then in the indycar days you
couldn't hit each other.

665
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:09,140
You know,
you really,

666
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,340
I mean it was,
you know,

667
00:26:10,341 --> 00:26:13,250
you could block and things like that.
So there were some guys out there that

668
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:15,410
were assholes and I didn't like them.
But you know,

669
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,950
sometimes every driver has some dry,
some other drivers that they don't

670
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:20,330
really get along with.
And so,

671
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,970
but in Nascar you can hit each other and
it's,

672
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,920
you have bumpers and,
um,

673
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,020
which is really cool,
but it also isn't cool because if

674
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,400
somebody wants to do it,
they can.

675
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:31,880
So what would I say?
I would say that they don't want to get

676
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,530
passed by a girl.
And you know what?

677
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,020
I don't either.
Is that weird?

678
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,790
No,
I really don't.

679
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,811
I mean,
I've driven,

680
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:41,270
I've raced with girls and I don't,
I don't like it.

681
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,010
So do you,
do you feel differently when a

682
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,350
guy passes you then when a girl passes
you probably,

683
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,380
yeah.
Yes.

684
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,500
In what way?
Well,

685
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,330
you know,
she'll just go internally.

686
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,680
That bitch,
I'm like,

687
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,130
can't believe my car isn't faster.
Right.

688
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,370
This sucks.
But it was a guy that passed stories

689
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,390
that are not good that I'm like,
you know,

690
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,020
come on the radio and I'd be like,
ah,

691
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:07,120
yeah,
I just want you to see that what car

692
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:10,990
passed me and how bad my car is out now.
Right now I'm,

693
00:27:10,991 --> 00:27:13,360
so it happens with guys too.
But you know,

694
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,170
I don't know.
It's just a cultural norm that girls

695
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:19,030
aren't good and allow,
you know,

696
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,580
aren't very good and that they,
they,

697
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,350
um,
somewhat don't belong.

698
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,470
And I get like the little bit of
animosity at first,

699
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:28,360
but I would have thought that people
would have got,

700
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,340
got used to it a little bit more than
they did.

701
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,380
So,
but you have that cultural and Masa,

702
00:27:33,381 --> 00:27:34,850
you were saying a little bit.
Yeah,

703
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,940
it comes from,
but when you say that it's a,

704
00:27:37,941 --> 00:27:40,010
it's a cultural norm that girls aren't
good.

705
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:41,450
You don't think about that about
yourself?

706
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,290
No.
Yeah.

707
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,220
See,
I knew that.

708
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,440
Oh,
there's,

709
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,410
you don't have any doubts.

710
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,760
No,
I get everyone out there.

711
00:27:46,761 --> 00:27:48,880
I'm like,
you suck because of this and I'm going

712
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:51,140
to beat you because of that and right.
Oh God,

713
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:53,840
I hate you.
I don't think because I'm a girl,

714
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:54,770
I'm not as good as,
no,

715
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:55,671
no,
not at all.

716
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:57,090
So why would you think that about the
other girl?

717
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:59,510
I don't know.
I just did it cause I'm not used to it.

718
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,590
Right.
You just something you're not used to.

719
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,720
Yeah,
that makes sense.

720
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,800
Yeah.
And we'll also,

721
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:04,634
it's like you're unique.

722
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,480
I mean,
what if you were out there in the gym

723
00:28:06,481 --> 00:28:09,030
and some girl comes and picks up more
weight than you and you're like,

724
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:09,880
oh,
that's weird.

725
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,200
I'll be like that pitches on roids.
She probably would be,

726
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:15,060
but Amazon freak,

727
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,840
some genetic freak.
I tried to sign her.

728
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,640
Bring it to you.
Oh yeah,

729
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,750
no kidding.
Do you know?

730
00:28:19,751 --> 00:28:21,280
Throw a punch.
Yeah.

731
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,180
Uh Huh.
Yeah,

732
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,961
I dunno.
I think,

733
00:28:22,961 --> 00:28:25,480
um,
I think we all have a cultural

734
00:28:25,481 --> 00:28:26,910
prejudices.
Yeah.

735
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,900
To a certain extent.
Whether we admit it or not.

736
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,531
And,
you know,

737
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:32,950
maybe you're not a big,
it maybe you're just maybe just have

738
00:28:32,951 --> 00:28:36,250
reservations and you're pleasantly
surprised when people surpass those

739
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,930
expectations.
Yeah.

740
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,820
You know,
but I would think that a,

741
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:44,821
you would experience probably more
discrimination as a woman.

742
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,223
Uh,
then,

743
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,620
I mean,
if you think about a woman doing almost

744
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,050
any other job,
like if you're telling me you're the

745
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:58,051
only woman that does that and you're at
this intense macho job,

746
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:01,810
this is a fucking intense job.
I mean,

747
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,960
you'd going 200 miles an hour.
Everybody's,

748
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,260
it's nuts.
That's a crazy job.

749
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,430
And you're out there at the top of the
food chain with all these men.

750
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,310
Yeah,
I would,

751
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,150
I would imagine there's two things that
happen.

752
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,350
There's a bunch of guys they treat you
with respect there.

753
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,290
They're like,
wow.

754
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
They're like impress.
Yeah,

755
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,060
yeah,
yeah.

756
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,160
They're cool with you.
They're like,

757
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,280
she's one of us.
That's right.

758
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,750
And then there's a few that are just
dicks and the those dicks or just

759
00:29:28,751 --> 00:29:32,580
encourageable.
Mm Man.

760
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,950
The amount of times I wish I was good at
taking people out.

761
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,280
I wish people knew how hard it was to
actually take someone out on track.

762
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:41,590
It's not that easy.
You would cause you can risk taking

763
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,760
yourself.
Exactly.

764
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,980
Yeah.
And if your car doesn't handle very

765
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:46,750
well,
you can't get close enough to him.

766
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,210
If you could,
you would just move the air,

767
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,970
which is almost like hitting him and get
him out of the way.

768
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,100
But sometimes the car doesn't handle
well enough,

769
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,490
so like you'd have to just bomb in there
and God willing,

770
00:29:57,491 --> 00:30:01,480
you hit them to get you to slow down and
then these go sailing and you keep

771
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:02,890
going.
But it's risk.

772
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,810
That's a rare moment,
right?

773
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,970
Yeah.
Have you done it before?

774
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,580
I've tried to take people.
I suck at it,

775
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,890
absolutely suck at it.
I've taken myself out like three times

776
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,030
trying to do it.
I mean,

777
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:14,200
look,
I'll be the lamb.

778
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:16,960
I don't mind it to make a point.
Um,

779
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,730
yeah.
I got to make a point of someone's

780
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:20,250
driving like a dick.
Yeah.

781
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,193
Yeah.

782
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,200
So what was the one that was the most
sad was,

783
00:30:25,201 --> 00:30:26,760
um,
uh,

784
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:30,330
it was a couple of years ago was at
Martinsville and this is when something

785
00:30:30,331 --> 00:30:34,350
was going down with,
it was Matt Kenseth and Joey Logano and

786
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:37,590
it was during the chase,
which is the last 10 races of the

787
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,210
season.
And they were in the chase,

788
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:43,410
Matt and Joey and Joey had made it so
that Matt couldn't get in,

789
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:46,170
cause he took them out of week earlier
week or two earlier and then they got to

790
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:48,180
Martinsville and it's a very,
very small short track.

791
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:50,490
It's just a half a mile.
And so it,

792
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,550
it's easy to kind of be able to attack
if you want to.

793
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:56,350
And so he just straight took them out
and um,

794
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,770
there was a whole big hoopla about it.
People up in arms thought it was totally

795
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:03,630
unfair and um,
anyway,

796
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:06,840
during the same race,
some asshole hits me,

797
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:09,630
takes,
spins me out and so I come back and I'm

798
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,440
a lap down or something cause he spins
me out and I go to take him out and I

799
00:31:13,441 --> 00:31:14,880
just sail off into the corner.

800
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:19,560
He manages to kind of keep going.
I spin again because I'm horrible at it.

801
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,660
And uh,
it turns out that,

802
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:26,310
you know,
I get up $50,000 fine because I am,

803
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,310
um,
I'm not racing for position because I

804
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:30,730
was a lap down.
Um,

805
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,230
and they applied that because that was
also the same race that Matt and Joey

806
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:37,500
had their big thing.
And I think maybe joey was leading or

807
00:31:37,501 --> 00:31:39,330
something like,
I think he was leading and it was on a

808
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,650
restart.
Um,

809
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:42,300
so they weren't racing for position
either.

810
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:46,620
So that was kind of like their rule that
they put forth to make for,

811
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:47,430
I mean,
Joe,

812
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:50,010
Matt probably got a hundred or $200,000
fine,

813
00:31:50,011 --> 00:31:51,570
but I'm there.
I am,

814
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,250
you know,
not the,

815
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,270
I'm definitely screwed in this scenario.
So I got fined 50 grand for it and I'm

816
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:58,104
the one that's out

817
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,520
the other guy.
If you're racing for position,

818
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:02,380
then it's okay to bump into each other
apparently.

819
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:02,700
Yes.

820
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,350
So really you're the one that screwed.
Because if you're racing,

821
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,650
if someone takes you out and then you're
still racing for position,

822
00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:12,870
now you're going to have to be
potentially,

823
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,850
you know,
putting yourself in another position to

824
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:18,690
get taken out when they started it.
It's a no win for the person that's

825
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,900
being aggressed the aggressor.

826
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,820
Was it always legal to bump into each
other?

827
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,120
Uh,
it's gone kind of through waves of

828
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:29,350
different rules,
but yeah,

829
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:30,700
I mean it is legal,
but when,

830
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:33,250
whenever a big accident happens and
there's a tragedy,

831
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,590
I would assume that that's when they
tightened down the rules.

832
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,480
Mm hmm.
Sometimes,

833
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:40,010
sometimes not.
Sometimes you just accept

834
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,950
that it's just happened.
Sometimes it's just usually if there's

835
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:46,520
something like that that happens,
it's not from one person's action that

836
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,700
it's maybe a chain of events that leads
to something like that.

837
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,170
It's one of the rare jobs that you do
that's a sport,

838
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,430
one of the rare sports where the
potential for death is always there.

839
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:58,683
Yeah,
it's true.

840
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,913
It is true.

841
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,640
Does that one of the reasons why you
decided

842
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,740
I am,
I'm not a daredevil.

843
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,740
Like I am not a daredevil.
I went bungee jumping and that is the

844
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:11,460
bravest thing I've ever done otherwise.
And I only did it because I am afraid of

845
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:13,470
heights.
So I just needed to know that if I had

846
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:14,670
to conquer a fear,
I could.

847
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,160
Well,
what's your definition of a daredevil?

848
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,930
Your your briefings or you could
potentially get hurt.

849
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:23,760
I'm not though.
That's true.

850
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,120
Yeah,
but you're a race car driver,

851
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,050
but I'm a methodical driver.
I'm methodical.

852
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,940
I don't go out there and just,
you know,

853
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,420
hold it wide open until the car does
something and then I'm like up better

854
00:33:33,421 --> 00:33:34,320
lift now.
I'm like,

855
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:37,050
I'm a thoughtful drivers,
so I build up what I think what you're

856
00:33:37,051 --> 00:33:39,540
saying is you're not stupid.
Ah,

857
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,030
that's very nice of you.
That's like a really,

858
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:44,580
really nice way to say that.

859
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,970
Yeah.
You're not dumb,

860
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:47,350
but you're definitely a daredevil.

861
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,151
Thank you.
Well,

862
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,620
I'm have to be.
I'm not,

863
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,720
there's no way you can not be.
I'm just not,

864
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:54,600
I'm serious.
That really knows me,

865
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:56,930
knows that I'm not brave.
Oh Wow.

866
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,410
That's so crazy.
I know.

867
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,950
I think you're talking crazy,
crazy talk over here.

868
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,510
Well,
you know,

869
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,450
it's true.
I just have been grooming this talent

870
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:09,660
since I was 10 and 26 years later.
I'm,

871
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,710
I'm okay with it.

872
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,620
I think it's both of those things,
but I think there's no doubt that you're

873
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:15,810
a brave person,
isn't it?

874
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,990
Actually my first time in a go kart was
horrible.

875
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,573
Well,
you three,

876
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:22,820
10,
10 and my sister was eight.

877
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,760
My Dad built the go carts.
There's a big parking lot out back.

878
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,810
So we got like spray cans,
wd Fort,

879
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,740
whatever,
pop cans,

880
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:31,640
I don't know.
Whatever.

881
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,840
Yeah.
I grew up in the Midwest,

882
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:34,160
so pop,
um,

883
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,750
and set them up in a big circle for my
sister and I to go out and drive around,

884
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,170
drive our go carts for the first time.
And um,

885
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,270
my dad made,
there was a little mistake with the

886
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:47,190
brake pedal and so it stopped working.
And um,

887
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,930
since I'm 10 and I'm s really young and
dumb and I don't know what I'm doing,

888
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,490
young,
dumb and broke,

889
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:53,324
I guess I was,
yeah,

890
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,250
like the song goes.
Um,

891
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,180
but I,
uh,

892
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,710
I went to hit the break,
it wasn't there,

893
00:34:57,711 --> 00:35:00,290
so instead of just spinning out or
continuing to turn,

894
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,690
I just went straight and I was headed
for,

895
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,520
um,
trailer,

896
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,450
like kind of a higher elevated trailer,
which would have resulted in

897
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:09,300
decapitation.

898
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,700
And I swerved at the last second and hit
a concrete wall and I like go flying and

899
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:18,170
my arm lays back on the,
on the muffler and my cool puffy jacket

900
00:35:18,171 --> 00:35:21,560
burns.
And like I bruises all up my legs and on

901
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:22,700
my arms.
And,

902
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,830
um,
that was my first time in a go kart

903
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,491
within,
you know,

904
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,440
five or 10 minutes of being out there.
And so,

905
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,360
um,
my dad just got a new one and built it

906
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,150
and we went racing.
So maybe I am really brave.

907
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:32,930
I don't know.
You're right.

908
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:37,380
Maybe it's,
I always felt like an indy car to some

909
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,940
degree.
I wasn't brave because people were

910
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:42,810
willing to do things that were
perceivably more brave.

911
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:44,850
But I also,
I did describe them as dumb.

912
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,571
You're right.
Yeah.

913
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:49,380
So you're probably a little right.
And I'm maybe a little right too,

914
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:50,020
but you're right.

915
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,130
I think you definitely brave,
but I think there's definitely a line

916
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:57,060
where bravery becomes stupid because the
risk outweighs the reward 100% yeah.

917
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,270
That's a masculine thing.
And a lot of ways because it's

918
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,000
testosterone makes you do really stupid
shit.

919
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,730
Does it won't.
They're all competing against each other

920
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,500
and the trying to out macho each other.
I mean,

921
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,600
you could go,
there's,

922
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,280
there's a bunch of twitter accounts so
you can go and see what's that one,

923
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,660
hold this beer.
Yeah.

924
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,260
Has a twitter account called hold my
beer while all these,

925
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,470
well,
exactly why I do everything.

926
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,740
It's like jumping off roofs and stupid
shit.

927
00:36:22,741 --> 00:36:27,150
And it's almost all men.
There's occasionally a drunk girl doing

928
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:29,700
something stupid,
but it's almost entirely men.

929
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,200
So I would think that men trying to out
macho with each other

930
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:36,140
somewhat inferior then because they do a
lot of dumb stuff.

931
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,540
Maybe their hormones are not in balance
like ours.

932
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,400
They definitely,
when competing against each other,

933
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:46,810
we'll do dumb shit.
That's an interest around drones to

934
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:47,321
blame.
Well,

935
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:49,060
they try to out macho each other.
Yeah.

936
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,860
Yeah,
I mean some don't.

937
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,590
Some are smart and they don't,
but you know,

938
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:58,360
there's just a part of being a man.
It's like trying to prove that you're

939
00:36:58,361 --> 00:37:00,790
not scared as part of being a man.
Tell me about men.

940
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,863
What do you wanna know

941
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,950
now?
What else is,

942
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,920
what else is a very manly that women
don't understand?

943
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:08,754
What,
what,

944
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:09,601
what,
what,

945
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:11,190
what don't women understand about men?

946
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,820
That's a good question.
I have no idea what you understand about

947
00:37:13,821 --> 00:37:15,520
us.
Hmm.

948
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,900
Maybe just speak from experience.
Hmm.

949
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:20,991
Yeah.
But I don't,

950
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:23,450
I don't know what,
like if we ask a guy like what's wrong?

951
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,500
Oh,
see that's just nonsense.

952
00:37:25,501 --> 00:37:27,340
Talk.
See that's the like,

953
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,600
what's Rani?
Girls out there like,

954
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,010
well honey,
what's wrong?

955
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,840
What's wrong?
And they're like nothing.

956
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,330
Sometimes it's not really,
is it really nothing?

957
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,590
Yeah.
Sometimes you just want me to like

958
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:37,820
decompress.
Okay.

959
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,080
You know,
sometimes it just wound it.

960
00:37:39,081 --> 00:37:41,240
Is that annoying when a girl does that?
Depends on the girl,

961
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,810
you know?
What do you mean?

962
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,190
Depends on the girl.
If she's annoying,

963
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:47,120
yeah,
it's annoying.

964
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:50,810
But if you're in love with her and she's
awesome and she can ask what's wrong,

965
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,243
nothing.
We're good.

966
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:54,940
Yeah.
It depends on the time.

967
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,050
The right one.
Oh,

968
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:01,060
100% that's 100% yeah.
If someone's asking you questions and

969
00:38:01,191 --> 00:38:04,340
you're getting really fucking annoyed,
it's probably not the question.

970
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,150
It's probably more the person.
If you think someone's amazing and they

971
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:09,950
ask you something stupid,
you'll just laugh.

972
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:12,920
You won't get annoyed.
And you guys get both joke around about

973
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:15,070
how stupid it was,
how the question was dumb.

974
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,070
All right,
that's good.

975
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,560
You get angry.
It's most likely you're just like,

976
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,873
I know it anyway.

977
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,280
Yeah.
So you're just like ready to ready to

978
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,270
ready to sort of fall over that annoying
and to get out.

979
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,880
Get out of my space.
Kind of a attitude.

980
00:38:28,881 --> 00:38:30,500
Cause you're already annoyed with them
anyway.

981
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,790
You're already don't really like him.

982
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,560
Yeah.
There's probably something that's

983
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:36,700
already rubbing you the wrong way and
you're tolerating each other instead of

984
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:39,070
enjoying each other.
Yeah.

985
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:40,750
I mean,
I would imagine a person like you,

986
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,800
a very intense person,
you probably have a difficult time

987
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,790
finding.
You know,

988
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:50,410
like if you get a square peg in a square
hole and everything slides in together,

989
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,540
perfect.
And everything's amazing personality

990
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,400
wise,
you know,

991
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,370
behavior wise,
I would imagine what something like you

992
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:58,930
look,
it's a very particular,

993
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,450
you have to find someone who appreciates
your intensity,

994
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,543
right?
Yeah.

995
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,940
Like a lot of times guys are,
they want a demure,

996
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:10,840
you know,
sort of like docile little creature.

997
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,860
Whatever you need,
I'll be home.

998
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:18,430
Well,
he on the table here when you get back,

999
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,291
right?
I mean,

1000
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,350
while you're out there with a fucking go
car going 150 miles an hour in the

1001
00:39:23,351 --> 00:39:24,780
driveway.
Yep.

1002
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,723
That's,
Yep.

1003
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,730
Run in five businesses.
Yeah.

1004
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,160
Yeah.
You're going 200.

1005
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,350
Yeah.
So if you're saying what's wrong,

1006
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:36,220
the guys like fucking nothing.
Probably a bunch of other shit that's

1007
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,080
really wrong.
It's very insightful.

1008
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:39,760
Yeah.
All right,

1009
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,520
so what,
what don't men understand about women?

1010
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,290
Um,
she's tapping her fingers,

1011
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,000
going through it.
Everything.

1012
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:49,943
Yeah.

1013
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,180
I mean,
I just think that we'd like to be,

1014
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,720
you know,
we like to be told what you're thinking.

1015
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,570
I do.
I like to know what someone's thinking,

1016
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,011
you know,
the whole,

1017
00:40:01,011 --> 00:40:02,210
like we're just,
you know,

1018
00:40:02,211 --> 00:40:03,880
just keeping it to myself.
Like,

1019
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,020
tell me about it.
I want to know what your self is

1020
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:07,430
thinking about.
I want to know about you.

1021
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,390
What's going through your head?
Like communication

1022
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,060
now,
is this universal amongst all your

1023
00:40:13,061 --> 00:40:14,920
girlfriends when you get together and
talk about,

1024
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:15,880
I would think so.
Yeah.

1025
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,550
Yeah.
So the problem is like,

1026
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:21,340
you look at a guy and say,
you know,

1027
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,660
you really liked this guy and you're
like,

1028
00:40:22,661 --> 00:40:24,700
this fucking dude.
Some crazy mystery.

1029
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:25,710
Like what's going on in your head,

1030
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,411
man?
Yeah.

1031
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:27,670
That's not good.
But it out.

1032
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,950
Everyone wants to know where they stand
and what someone's thinking.

1033
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,850
Oh,
where they stand.

1034
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:32,530
Well,
because and where they stand on what

1035
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,630
they're thinking.
Because you know what if the thing about

1036
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:35,464
someone else,

1037
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,430
oh,
so he needed,

1038
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:37,930
no,
sorry.

1039
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,410
Yeah,
you just need to know if you're all in.

1040
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,270
Yeah,
100%

1041
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,780
I'm still all in person.
So for me it's not a mystery.

1042
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:45,830
Like you wanna know what's going on in
my head.

1043
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:46,664
I'll tell you right now.

1044
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,500
That's intense.
Yeah.

1045
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,330
Yeah.
So yeah,

1046
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:53,050
if a guy's like off drifting and you
automatically assume test one of the

1047
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:55,920
fuckers thinking wrong,
somebody else now what are you up to?

1048
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,903
Yeah,
and it's,

1049
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,120
yeah,
exactly.

1050
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:03,730
You want to be able to ask.
I guess guys probably do that too.

1051
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,750
And girls like to hear nice things to
girls like to hear,

1052
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,080
you know,
girls like to be,

1053
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:10,180
you know,
girls like of course,

1054
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,730
you know,
to uh,

1055
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,990
be appreciated just like a guy does.
I mean,

1056
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:16,180
I think that's my advice most of the
time in relationships.

1057
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:18,610
I'm like,
sympathy goes a really long way because

1058
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:22,300
I know it goes a long way with me no
matter what facet of my life it is.

1059
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,400
But you know,
sympathy goes a long way.

1060
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:26,980
So you know,
if your husband's in a bad mood,

1061
00:41:26,981 --> 00:41:28,570
then why don't you just actually start
off with,

1062
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:30,490
instead of feeling like you're under
appreciated going,

1063
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,620
hey baby,
look like you've had a really long day

1064
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:34,160
and I'm sure you've been working your
butt off.

1065
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,540
Like what can I,
can I make you dinner?

1066
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,890
Like what do you want?
What's your favorite?

1067
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,090
You know,
and they'll probably go,

1068
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,730
oh,
you know what is not that not that big

1069
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,521
of a deal.
You know what Babe,

1070
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:42,081
I'm fine.
Hey,

1071
00:41:42,081 --> 00:41:44,030
let me take you out to dinner.
I get to eat.

1072
00:41:44,031 --> 00:41:46,410
The sympathy gets sympathy back and you
don't,

1073
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,520
it's not,
it's not good to do it to get it

1074
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:51,650
necessarily,
but you should really feel like you are

1075
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:54,320
sympathetic.
Like if they're in a bad place,

1076
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:56,180
try and help him.
That's sound advice.

1077
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,450
Yeah,
center stage.

1078
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,470
Just sympathy because most people go
under appreciate,

1079
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:02,600
especially in a relationship.
I think the longer it goes,

1080
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,290
there's a lot of under appreciation and
assumptions that get made about who does

1081
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:10,520
what and checks that box off.
And probably,

1082
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:11,910
especially with kids,
right amounts,

1083
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:13,400
you're with kids,
it gets way worse.

1084
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,930
It's just,
there's a lot of time that's involved

1085
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,090
with taking care of those little
suckers.

1086
00:42:18,091 --> 00:42:21,180
You got to pay attention to them and
talk to them and they,

1087
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,270
and if you have more than one,
like once you start talking to one,

1088
00:42:24,271 --> 00:42:26,970
the other one wants to just chime in,
you know,

1089
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:28,350
and show you what they're doing.

1090
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:28,931
Like,
wait,

1091
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:30,970
I was busy just trying to make sure you
don't die.

1092
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,830
Now I gotta deal with this.

1093
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

1094
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:37,820
I think people get used to things,
you know,

1095
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,410
and that's,
that's part of the problem.

1096
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,750
They get used to each other.
Yeah.

1097
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,150
They do.
And then,

1098
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,510
and then,
you know,

1099
00:42:44,511 --> 00:42:47,060
it's like,
I always tell people,

1100
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,840
aspire to be the person you pretend to
be when you're trying to get laid.

1101
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,350
If you could be that person all the
time,

1102
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,030
you will have a much better life.

1103
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:59,000
I also love the expression for every hot
chick,

1104
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:00,200
there's a dude sickest.
Groner.

1105
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,360
Yeah.
I don't say it that way,

1106
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,110
but yes,
I use more flavorful language,

1107
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:06,920
but yeah.

1108
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,140
Is that,
was that too much or too little?

1109
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:10,940
Too Little?
How would you say it?

1110
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,140
Uh,
for every hot chick,

1111
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:14,910
there's a guy somewhere that's tired of
fucking her.

1112
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,710
Okay.
That's how you'd say it,

1113
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:20,970
but yeah,
I mean I guess but that's not entirely

1114
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:25,200
true either.
I mean it's for the most part,

1115
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:28,620
a lot of the times it's true,
but a lot of the times people don't

1116
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,570
appreciate for circumstance.
Exactly,

1117
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,700
and then it's with various aspects of
your life,

1118
00:43:32,701 --> 00:43:36,780
like I always feel like that.
Like I just got over the flu a week and

1119
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,430
a half ago.
I had the flu and I was sick for like

1120
00:43:38,431 --> 00:43:40,710
two days and then when I was sick I was
thinking,

1121
00:43:40,711 --> 00:43:44,190
man,
I don't appreciate how good I feel when

1122
00:43:44,191 --> 00:43:49,020
I'm healthy because here I am line here.
I'll aiken watching netflix feeling like

1123
00:43:49,021 --> 00:43:50,790
shit going,
wow,

1124
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:52,950
what?
I'm healthy and I'm working out and I'm

1125
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:57,951
running and doing Jujitsu and all the
activities and I got all this energy and

1126
00:43:58,621 --> 00:44:01,680
I feel great.
Like I just can't do anything right now.

1127
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:06,510
I just take it for granted.
You do forget the joy of just being

1128
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,700
healthy.
It just escapes us.

1129
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:12,800
We just so think it's normal because
most of the time you granted,

1130
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,610
Yup.
Yup.

1131
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,060
Now,
do you think that your stepping away

1132
00:44:18,061 --> 00:44:22,650
from race car driving when you deciding
just like enough is enough?

1133
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:26,880
Do you think that in some ways that this
is,

1134
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:30,480
you appreciating other aspects of life
too,

1135
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:31,860
that you are,
you're,

1136
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:32,130
you're

1137
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,810
looking at your racing thing and you're
like,

1138
00:44:33,811 --> 00:44:35,430
you know what,
I did a lot,

1139
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:39,740
I did enough and then why don't I just
appreciate all the other stuff?

1140
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,650
Well,
I think that's a good question.

1141
00:44:41,651 --> 00:44:43,570
A leading me into a good thought.
Like,

1142
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,220
um,
I think it's actually more me being

1143
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:52,000
honest.
Like I think everyone would expect since

1144
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:54,160
I do what I do at the level that I do it
at,

1145
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:56,500
that racing is my only thing I care
about.

1146
00:44:56,501 --> 00:44:58,840
I love it so much.
I'll do anything I drive every day.

1147
00:44:58,841 --> 00:45:01,750
And the truth is no,
I like racing,

1148
00:45:01,751 --> 00:45:03,130
but I don't,
there's a lot of things I don't really

1149
00:45:03,131 --> 00:45:06,280
like about it too and I'm grateful for
everything it's given me.

1150
00:45:06,281 --> 00:45:10,330
But if you were to ask me what I do
outside of racing and my personal life,

1151
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,880
I don't go to the race track.
I don't really watch races.

1152
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,530
I don't,
I don't do that.

1153
00:45:14,531 --> 00:45:17,380
So those aren't my hobbies.
Like your hobbies or your real loves,

1154
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,140
what do you not like about it?

1155
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,860
Um,
well I would say that in the last year

1156
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,310
or so,
the,

1157
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,370
just the,
as far as an energetic space,

1158
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:32,090
it's just so sad and negative at times.
A lot of the time.

1159
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:36,080
And even in just racing in general,
most of the time it's miserable.

1160
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,830
Like you have some days that are good,
but most of the time it's not happy and

1161
00:45:39,831 --> 00:45:40,700
you wish there was,
you're,

1162
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,543
you're,
you're,

1163
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,020
you're,
um,

1164
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,410
you're not satisfied.
You wish somebody would have treated you

1165
00:45:45,411 --> 00:45:46,470
better out there.
You,

1166
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,390
there's so many things to be negative
about and just the grind of it.

1167
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,080
Um,
it's the people,

1168
00:45:54,081 --> 00:45:58,130
like everybody's worn out and you know,
you have to be really careful about the

1169
00:45:58,131 --> 00:46:00,830
people that are around you because they
got to be in a good mood because it's

1170
00:46:00,831 --> 00:46:04,490
easy to spiral out of control because
you see each other for three,

1171
00:46:04,491 --> 00:46:06,950
four days a week,
every week for 40 weeks a year.

1172
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:07,731
So,
you know,

1173
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,010
you got to be in a good space with
people,

1174
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,470
but it's still doesn't alienate you
completely.

1175
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:14,450
Even if there,
you're in a good space with people,

1176
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,610
the ones next to you,
cause you've got a car next to you on

1177
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:20,510
both sides in the garage and haulers
next to each other and buses right next

1178
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,640
to each other and you see a bunch of
other people.

1179
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:23,690
So,
you know,

1180
00:46:23,691 --> 00:46:24,710
it was just,
I dunno,

1181
00:46:24,711 --> 00:46:26,780
there's a lot of negativity to some
degree.

1182
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,550
Um,
a lot of grind.

1183
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:30,470
It just kinda feels like the grind a
little bit.

1184
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,360
Um,
and um,

1185
00:46:32,361 --> 00:46:36,680
so I just kind of felt like it wasn't a
space that I wanted to be in as much

1186
00:46:36,681 --> 00:46:37,311
anymore.
Like,

1187
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,830
I,
I want to be in a happy space where I'm

1188
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:43,400
just doing things that bring me joy and
um,

1189
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,420
yeah,
it just,

1190
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,690
there wasn't doing that as much or I was
noticing it,

1191
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,810
I was noticing I was missing that or
wanting it more.

1192
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,290
I think that's really what it comes from
is growing as a person and realizing,

1193
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,470
um,
I think everybody's afraid to take

1194
00:46:57,471 --> 00:47:00,560
chances and do something new in their
life because they're identified a

1195
00:47:00,561 --> 00:47:03,950
certain way or there'll be judged if
they don't do it or judged if they do

1196
00:47:03,951 --> 00:47:07,130
something different and who are they now
and are they crazy and what are they

1197
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:08,870
thinking?
And you know,

1198
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,720
it's just life.
Just do things that make you happy.

1199
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,090
It's interesting because you're talking
about this and the negative aspects of

1200
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:18,660
it as all interpersonal relationships
and so talking to people,

1201
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:22,260
you're not talking about that the grind
of racing itself,

1202
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:26,460
like the heat of being in the car and
the strain and the intensity and the

1203
00:47:26,461 --> 00:47:27,900
nerves.
You're not talking about it.

1204
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,691
Yeah,
I didn't,

1205
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:30,190
I didn't,
not the first thing.

1206
00:47:30,191 --> 00:47:31,120
I mean,
that is,

1207
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,000
that exists on some level,
but I mean that's,

1208
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,350
that's fine.
I work out,

1209
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,910
I work out twice a day,
a lot of time,

1210
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:39,610
a lot of times.
So I'm okay with the whole like physical

1211
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:40,690
grind of things.
Yeah.

1212
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,860
Yeah.
What do you do?

1213
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,060
Crossfit and like interval running,
training,

1214
00:47:46,061 --> 00:47:47,700
sprinting,
um,

1215
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:52,150
stuff like that.
Circuits toys or volt stuff.

1216
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,860
Yeah.
A couple of days a week.

1217
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:56,020
I do twice a day.
Maybe more intensity.

1218
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,820
Yeah.
Very intense for sure.

1219
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:58,421
Yeah,
that's,

1220
00:47:58,421 --> 00:47:59,254
that's,
that's,

1221
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,270
that's the name of the game and get it,
get in,

1222
00:48:01,271 --> 00:48:02,890
get out.
Um,

1223
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,000
so,
uh,

1224
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,440
so yeah,
so I mean that,

1225
00:48:05,441 --> 00:48:07,780
that is part of it.
The physical part of racing exists and

1226
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:09,850
it is exhausting,
but I mean,

1227
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:12,220
you recover from that every weekend.
Um,

1228
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,090
but yeah,
it's,

1229
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,280
yeah,
it's just,

1230
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,960
and I just love so many other things.

1231
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,650
What are you going to do now?
Um,

1232
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,810
well,
the longest project I have is my wine.

1233
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,510
Um,
I bought the property in 2009,

1234
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,700
planted a vineyard and it's finally for
sale.

1235
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:28,923
Um,
so,

1236
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,430
um,
so it's called,

1237
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:33,880
started in 2009.
So nine years bought the property,

1238
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:35,650
planted.
It started from nothing.

1239
00:48:35,651 --> 00:48:36,660
So,
um,

1240
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,070
it came from a,
in 2006,

1241
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:42,970
I went to Napa valley on a,
on a trip and was on this beautiful

1242
00:48:42,971 --> 00:48:46,630
property and just like looking at the
fog and the valley and it was wonderful

1243
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:50,140
Keesha's and fruits for breakfast and
this amazing white wine.

1244
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:50,891
And I was like,
man,

1245
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:53,660
it'd be so cool if I could have
something like this someday,

1246
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,730
but I don't have $50 million,
at least not right now anyway.

1247
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,520
And um,
cause I never abandoned the thought that

1248
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,530
I would be able to afford that someday.
I just didn't,

1249
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,653
I couldn't then.

1250
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,020
Um,
so anyway,

1251
00:49:05,021 --> 00:49:06,250
I just started the process of different
way.

1252
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:08,950
I didn't buy a wine that was built and
established for the vineyard.

1253
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:11,500
I bought dirt,
planted the vineyard.

1254
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,190
How do you go about doing that?
Do you hire someone?

1255
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:16,001
Uh,
well I,

1256
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:21,001
that that day I met I winemaker who
ended up going into consulting instead

1257
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:24,730
of just being at one winery and I'm,
so he actually helped me pick the

1258
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:26,950
property.
He's still my winemaker today.

1259
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,300
So you,
you buy this piece of land and then like

1260
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,790
who does the day to day stuff?
You're so busy.

1261
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,440
Yeah,
I have a gm now,

1262
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,440
um,
who handles all of it and does the

1263
00:49:38,441 --> 00:49:41,050
promotion and gets it in restaurants and
you know,

1264
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:43,240
s you know,
help sell it.

1265
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:44,800
What's it called?
Omnium,

1266
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,280
which is a Latin world,
Latin word means dream.

1267
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,620
I was looking at some language
translations trying to come up with,

1268
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:56,710
I was probably trying to come up with
some sort of an llc or something like

1269
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:58,660
that to cover the property up.

1270
00:49:58,660 --> 00:49:59,471
And I was like,
oh no,

1271
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:01,720
this is way too cool.
This is what should the wine should be

1272
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:02,890
called?
Um,

1273
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:04,360
so Somnio I'm,
it's a Latin word.

1274
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,740
And Are you doing red and white or red
to start?

1275
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:09,401
Um,
the only,

1276
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:12,820
the vineyard is cabernet cab franc,
petite for doe.

1277
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,140
And um,
so from the cab franc in petite or doe

1278
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,360
bleed off,
we're going to make a rose a this year.

1279
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,690
Um,
and then we also then source some grapes

1280
00:50:22,691 --> 00:50:24,580
from Knight's Valley to make a 70 old
blank.

1281
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,900
Um,
so we,

1282
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:27,800
um,
we just decided it was going to come out

1283
00:50:27,801 --> 00:50:31,970
in the spraying along with the,
with the cab or early release and the

1284
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,650
um,
and the,

1285
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,510
and the rosy,
but it needed some time in barrel.

1286
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:39,170
So we're going to wait a little longer
and put it in barrel.

1287
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,660
That's fascinating.
So that much take a shit load of your

1288
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:44,950
time and thinking as well.
Honestly,

1289
00:50:44,951 --> 00:50:47,330
that's probably the least amount of my
time really that company.

1290
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,110
But I would imagine if you have this
giant investment,

1291
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,700
you've got the skull,
it's a giant investment,

1292
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:53,840
I would imagine.
Yeah.

1293
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:56,000
Do you have someone working for you?
They're growing grapes,

1294
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,970
two employees and um,
um,

1295
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:00,170
uh,
farmers that farm,

1296
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:02,190
it's not full.
I mean they farm many other properties,

1297
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:03,570
but um,
but yeah.

1298
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,110
Were you affected at all by the crazy
fires and no,

1299
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,180
actually I was really lucky that the
Napa valley fires were,

1300
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,750
um,
I'm on Silverado trail side up.

1301
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,750
It's actually very,
very close to how mountain appalachian,

1302
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:16,740
but it's,
I'm like,

1303
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,720
like 60 feet off of being home out in
the Appalachian.

1304
00:51:19,721 --> 00:51:22,640
So anyway,
way down south on Silverado trail there

1305
00:51:22,641 --> 00:51:25,470
was fire and then straight across the
valley.

1306
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,640
Not too far laterally across,
but it was all the way across the valley

1307
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:33,360
was the fires on the other side.
So I was about as far away from it all

1308
00:51:33,361 --> 00:51:35,760
is I could get.
And so I just talked to my wine maker,

1309
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:39,630
I'm a few days ago and um,
he said that there's really nothing,

1310
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,660
no residual from any of the fires or
anything.

1311
00:51:42,661 --> 00:51:44,370
So that's amazing.
Like with my wine.

1312
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:45,204
Anyway,
so,

1313
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,270
so that whole area,
it's such a bummer that fire was in the

1314
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,710
same,
oh my gosh,

1315
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:51,990
I just thought it was going,
I forget the exact number,

1316
00:51:51,991 --> 00:51:55,890
but it was something in insane,
like it was going a football field

1317
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,830
distance in three seconds,
like at its peak.

1318
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,040
I know that the bigger,
I think the big reason was the wind came

1319
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:04,590
in that night,
like 40 plus mile an hour winds came

1320
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:06,540
through that night.
Very,

1321
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,280
very,
very devastating for some.

1322
00:52:08,590 --> 00:52:09,870
Uh,
but that's one company.

1323
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,330
Um,
the clothing line is called warrior.

1324
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,310
Um,
so that came out a year ago,

1325
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,810
January of last year of 17.
Wow.

1326
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,950
Uh,
when

1327
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,650
is it like affliction,
like skulls and swords and shit?

1328
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:23,623
No.

1329
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,250
Is the warrior jacket I have on,
it's very nice.

1330
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:26,940
Thanks.
Lovely.

1331
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,380
Um,
no,

1332
00:52:28,381 --> 00:52:30,330
it's more athleisure.
Um,

1333
00:52:30,331 --> 00:52:31,770
so leisure,
leisure,

1334
00:52:31,771 --> 00:52:33,620
have you never heard of that leisure?
No.

1335
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,950
Oh yeah.
It's a whole,

1336
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:36,241
yeah,
there you go.

1337
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:37,190
Thanks.
Um,

1338
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:41,330
I just saw like a 17 year old.
Um,

1339
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:41,951
it's,
yeah,

1340
00:52:41,951 --> 00:52:44,250
it's,
it's like leggings and sports bras and

1341
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,860
tee shirts and jackets and sweatshirts
and,

1342
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,490
yeah,
as Felicia [inaudible].

1343
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,430
So,
uh,

1344
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:51,990
I want to go back to this wine thing.
Oh,

1345
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,380
so you have this thought in your and
abroad?

1346
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,240
Yeah.
Well I'll go buy some,

1347
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:58,050
tell me where I can get it.
Can you get it anywhere?

1348
00:52:58,060 --> 00:52:58,310
Right?

1349
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:01,500
Omnium wine.com.
It's not sold in very many places and

1350
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:03,780
mostly online it's not,
there's not very much made,

1351
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:04,320
so,

1352
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:04,761
oh,
okay.

1353
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:06,950
So you can order it online and you guys
will ship it.

1354
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,790
Okay.
So now you,

1355
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:12,410
you get this piece of property and you
start talking to this guy.

1356
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:15,200
He was a consultant and you started
talking about making wine,

1357
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,970
like what is the process like how does
it,

1358
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,863
you,
you have to,

1359
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,870
you buy the property and then how do you
get the seeds?

1360
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:23,000
How do you get the right grapes?
How do you know?

1361
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,850
Well,
you have to go through a bunch of 'em

1362
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,670
permitting.
Um,

1363
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:28,860
so permitting for,
uh,

1364
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,270
plans for it.
Uh,

1365
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:35,010
there's a certain grades that are not.
So if it's over 20 degrees grade,

1366
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,890
then you have to have special approvals,
but under you can plant.

1367
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:42,600
So I literally planted six acres ish of
Max.

1368
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:47,601
It's the Max that I could plant on my 24
acres that I have that was below 20

1369
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:48,930
degree grade.
And so,

1370
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:50,220
um,
so,

1371
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:52,350
uh,
you have to go through erosion control

1372
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,180
permitting because it's,
you know,

1373
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,580
the slopes and if you're going to dig up
the ground,

1374
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:58,470
you don't want it to slide down the
mountain if it rains.

1375
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:01,170
So we had to kind of get creative with
some of the,

1376
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:05,550
uh,
infrastructure to dissipate the water.

1377
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:08,070
And so it didn't create just rivers and
rushing of,

1378
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,290
you know,
new dirt sliding down the hill.

1379
00:54:10,291 --> 00:54:11,010
So,
um,

1380
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,080
cause it's al Asad elevation a little
bit.

1381
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,490
Um,
so,

1382
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:18,120
um,
and then you hire farmers and then the

1383
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:23,121
winemaker helps pick out the root stock
and the clones and then they plan it and

1384
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:26,520
you wait a couple of years for it to be
ready and then they start making wine.

1385
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,130
So it starts with clones,
which is route stops first.

1386
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,013
Oh,
root stock.

1387
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:32,990
And then what does he graft on the clone
that they want?

1388
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,620
What's a root stock?
Like the actual route.

1389
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,750
Yeah,
that would be,

1390
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,150
I wish I knew every single thing that
you're asking to the nth degree,

1391
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:46,151
but I mean that would be like Cabernet,
petite verdot white wine,

1392
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,850
right.
Whatever.

1393
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,590
I'm sure that there,
when they did all this,

1394
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,520
I,
no,

1395
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,670
I want to see what that is.
That sounds fascinating.

1396
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:56,310
Tiny little tiny little roots.
Yeah.

1397
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,760
Trellising up.
And then,

1398
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,530
you know,
then you get into,

1399
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,240
you know,
depending on your wine maker,

1400
00:55:02,241 --> 00:55:05,300
they decide then how much fruit to drop.
Um,

1401
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:06,220
so,
um,

1402
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,990
sort of the,
the vine comes up and splits off and

1403
00:55:08,991 --> 00:55:10,670
makes like a tea.
Um,

1404
00:55:10,671 --> 00:55:15,671
and so they decide how many clusters
they keep on each side to determine,

1405
00:55:17,091 --> 00:55:18,440
you know,
what kind of wine you're making.

1406
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:19,700
So,
you know,

1407
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,790
we drop a lot of fruit to make really
good.

1408
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:22,250
Yeah.

1409
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:25,130
What does that mean by drop fruit?
Like you'd lose literally cut the cut

1410
00:55:25,131 --> 00:55:26,240
the cluster off of the vine.

1411
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,013
So you,
yeah,

1412
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:30,750
that's why I like if you're buying bulk
wine,

1413
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:34,230
it's they're not dropping a damn thing.
Right,

1414
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,460
right.
If you're buying grapes,

1415
00:55:35,461 --> 00:55:37,230
they're also not dropping a damn thing
or,

1416
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:39,150
well,
not as much probably because there,

1417
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:41,110
um,
because they're there,

1418
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:42,960
they're there.
You're paying by the ton.

1419
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,430
So this is a long process.
Oh,

1420
00:55:45,431 --> 00:55:50,431
it's a really long process to go nine
years from the time you start to making

1421
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:51,394
your first bottles.

1422
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,010
Probably why most people,
you know,

1423
00:55:53,011 --> 00:55:54,960
I mean,
if you have enough money to build a

1424
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:57,390
winery,
you're probably a bit older and like you

1425
00:55:57,391 --> 00:55:58,224
run out of time.

1426
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,740
Yeah,
yeah.

1427
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:00,770
I mean especially,
yeah.

1428
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:02,980
You're going to get any return on your
investment.

1429
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,720
You know,
I'm a lot of millions in the hole,

1430
00:56:04,721 --> 00:56:05,620
but you know,
whatever,

1431
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:06,490
it's a passion project.

1432
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,790
Are you doing it as an investment?
Are you doing it because you

1433
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,600
love it?
Um,

1434
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,340
and uh,
yeah,

1435
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,713
I can

1436
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,710
cause you can,
yeah.

1437
00:56:15,711 --> 00:56:17,290
Why not do what you can.
Yeah.

1438
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:19,100
Just money.
Yeah.

1439
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:21,680
And I love the lifestyle.
So I want to share that with people.

1440
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,060
You know,
our style Nafa

1441
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,780
wine,
you know,

1442
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,360
the connection that you create,
you know,

1443
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:30,990
sitting down together and sharing it.
Um,

1444
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,850
the stories of the vineyard,
the story of how it came along.

1445
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:34,480
I mean,
I have,

1446
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,650
the good thing is,
is people were like,

1447
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:36,251
well,
you gotta have a story.

1448
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:36,610
I'm like,
well,

1449
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:39,220
I have a story,
but that's what people connect to.

1450
00:56:39,221 --> 00:56:40,170
So,
um,

1451
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,961
that's,
you know,

1452
00:56:40,961 --> 00:56:44,020
so then it's a matter of getting that
story to the psalms in different

1453
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:46,840
restaurants so that they can tell you
the story of Somnio them and then,

1454
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:47,560
you know,
you're like,

1455
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,341
oh,
that sounds amazing.

1456
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:48,941
No,
that's hers.

1457
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:49,870
That's so cool.
Like,

1458
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,690
I would love it if my wine was a good
story that someone told.

1459
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:53,471
And then they were like,
oh,

1460
00:56:53,471 --> 00:56:55,160
and this is the actually Danica Patrick
swine.

1461
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:56,230
And you're like,
oh,

1462
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:57,041
no way.
Yeah.

1463
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,270
I got to try that.
You know what I mean?

1464
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:00,760
I'd rather have that be the backstory.
Then the front story.

1465
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,100
Do you know,
um,

1466
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:03,850
maynard teen and from tool to know?

1467
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:04,861
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1468
00:57:04,861 --> 00:57:07,320
I've drank his wine before.
Could he see us?

1469
00:57:07,321 --> 00:57:10,080
Caduceus could do see us?
Yes.

1470
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,130
Yes.
I have some.

1471
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,440
It's in my fridge right now.
Got it a long time ago.

1472
00:57:13,441 --> 00:57:16,560
Got it up in a jerome,
jerome,

1473
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:19,440
Arizona.
He has a little cellar door in jerome.

1474
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,760
That's awesome.
Yeah.

1475
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,780
Yeah.
I've never met him.

1476
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:23,840
I tried to meet him and I bawled.
I was like,

1477
00:57:23,841 --> 00:57:24,674
eh,
but it didn't.

1478
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,610
He's actually in town I think.
Oh really?

1479
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,230
Yeah.
I think he's still here.

1480
00:57:28,231 --> 00:57:29,850
He was just,
he was here yesterday for sure.

1481
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,350
Yeah.
He starts to some of his grapes from

1482
00:57:31,351 --> 00:57:33,240
California,
I think for som is wine.

1483
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,860
Yeah.
He did a similar thing,

1484
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:36,540
but he did it in Arizona.
Yes.

1485
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,080
He just bought this land and then
develop it for salmon,

1486
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,940
Arizona,
but the red,

1487
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,070
I think the better red came from
California.

1488
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,910
Is that what he's a freak.
He's a real crazy person.

1489
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:48,660
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1490
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:50,400
In what way?
Super Intelligent.

1491
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:51,990
Just super,
super smart,

1492
00:57:51,991 --> 00:57:54,480
like too smart,
too smart to talk to most people.

1493
00:57:54,481 --> 00:57:57,870
He's just so out there and an intense as
well.

1494
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,380
And maybe it's something to do with,
you know,

1495
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,470
the,
the choices.

1496
00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:02,370
So he,
I mean,

1497
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,610
he's a lead singer,
three fucking bands and then says,

1498
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:06,391
you know what?
Yeah.

1499
00:58:06,391 --> 00:58:08,820
And then let me,
let me just start making my own wine.

1500
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,530
Yeah.
Opened up a restaurant.

1501
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:12,370
Like he's just,
he can't do enough shit.

1502
00:58:12,371 --> 00:58:14,030
He does Jujitsu all the time.
Can't do it.

1503
00:58:14,031 --> 00:58:15,420
I'm sure you guys know him.
Yeah.

1504
00:58:15,421 --> 00:58:17,340
And he was over here for Jujitsu to,
um,

1505
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,360
um,
uh,

1506
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:19,600
seminars.
John,

1507
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,630
Donna her.
He was at one of his seminars.

1508
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,650
Yes sir.
Oh yeah.

1509
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:23,633
No,
he's a maniac.

1510
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:26,160
Weirdos make wine then.
I think so.

1511
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:28,080
Well,
I think I'd rather be weird than normal.

1512
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,330
I think that's a good way of looking at
things.

1513
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:32,190
It's nothing wrong with being word
normal.

1514
00:58:32,191 --> 00:58:35,190
Unconventional,
or the opposite of where I looked it up.

1515
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,430
I don't want to be either of those.
Yeah.

1516
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,750
Well,
it depends,

1517
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,640
you know,
conventional wisdom is not bad.

1518
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,890
It said conventional.
Yeah.

1519
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,920
There's,
there's some normal that's not bad.

1520
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,810
You know,
I like normal cheeseburgers,

1521
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,160
you know,

1522
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,310
I don't see,
I want caramelized onions.

1523
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:56,130
I want to Friday I want Maple Bacon.
Ah,

1524
00:58:56,370 --> 00:59:00,260
you're a pain in the ass.
I love food.

1525
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,380
Like I love food.
I ate more than most everyone.

1526
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:04,700
Yes.
Yeah.

1527
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,280
But your tiny,
well you put it away.

1528
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,400
Well you work out twice a day.
Some days I didn't work out today.

1529
00:59:10,401 --> 00:59:12,500
It didn't work out.
It didn't work out to work out.

1530
00:59:12,530 --> 00:59:14,670
But um,
yeah,

1531
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,150
I do eat a lot.
My sister and I both do,

1532
00:59:17,151 --> 00:59:17,984
we're both like

1533
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,100
110 tenish pounds and

1534
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,580
we are both like five foot and we both
eat a ton,

1535
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,640
but we work at what you do,
where we do work out a little

1536
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:31,700
hummingbirds,
hey you all that energy,

1537
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,740
you're burning off pro burning calories
council.

1538
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:36,260
We look at each other and were like,
I would die without fat.

1539
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,130
I need a lot of fat in my diet.
Yeah.

1540
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,050
Um,
maynard open up a restaurant to an

1541
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:42,893
awesome yeah,

1542
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,500
no in,
in Arizona.

1543
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,550
Hmm.
So,

1544
00:59:45,551 --> 00:59:47,520
so sort of feature is wines

1545
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:48,421
and where,
uh,

1546
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:50,670
where in Arizona,
because I know Joe's jerome is pretty

1547
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:52,410
far from like,
I mean I might have,

1548
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,120
my place is in Scottsdale,
so yeah,

1549
00:59:54,121 --> 00:59:56,400
he's out in the middle of nowhere.
He's uh,

1550
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,000
his vineyards.
Jerome.

1551
00:59:58,170 --> 00:59:59,310
Yeah.
I think it's in that era.

1552
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,100
Homes on the top of a mountain.
I mean this is a,

1553
01:00:02,101 --> 01:00:04,680
this is a cool place to go if you're
ever visiting Arizona.

1554
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:08,040
Jerome is really interesting.
You kind of wind up this mountain,

1555
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:11,010
you get up to the top.
It's like supposedly all haunted and

1556
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:12,740
it's very bizarre.
Um,

1557
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:13,620
but there's,
yeah,

1558
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:15,300
he,
I mean the last I knew it was a very

1559
01:00:15,301 --> 01:00:16,860
long time ago that I was there.
Um,

1560
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:17,790
but it,
um,

1561
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:18,930
it,
uh,

1562
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:21,900
he has a cool cellar door and there's
some restaurants and whatnot and it's on

1563
01:00:21,901 --> 01:00:22,734
top of a mountain.

1564
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:24,080
Yeah,
that's,

1565
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,020
that's maynard.
That's the kind of thing he's into.

1566
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:32,260
And he's very wise to about balancing
out the rock star life versus like,

1567
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:37,040
that's one of the things that I think
was attractive to him about creating a

1568
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:37,874
wine.

1569
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,320
I'd say that's really important.
I mean I've,

1570
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,500
I think I've feel like I've figured out
in my life how much grounding I need to

1571
01:00:45,931 --> 01:00:47,760
balance me out.
And it's not like,

1572
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,710
it's not just like everybody needs 50,
50,

1573
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:52,320
you know,
it's been 50% of the time walking around

1574
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:54,570
in the woods and 50% of the time doing
your shit.

1575
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:55,800
It's,
you know,

1576
01:00:55,801 --> 01:00:57,750
everybody's different.
So for me it's like,

1577
01:00:57,751 --> 01:01:01,920
you know,
maybe 20% of the time I need to take a

1578
01:01:01,921 --> 01:01:06,921
walk in nature or do a yoga class or
meditate or something like that.

1579
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:08,790
Yeah.
Do you feel like,

1580
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:12,690
do you need decompression time just from
the whole celebrity thing,

1581
01:01:12,691 --> 01:01:17,691
just being interviewed and media and
people paying attention to you want to

1582
01:01:17,851 --> 01:01:19,080
take pictures with you?
They'll just,

1583
01:01:19,081 --> 01:01:21,150
the constant assault.

1584
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,800
I don't feel it's exhausting because I'm
listening and I'm paying attention.

1585
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:30,800
I'm answering your questions honestly.
Where I think most people can just go

1586
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:35,330
into sort of like autopilot mode and
it's probably not as mentally exhausting

1587
01:01:35,331 --> 01:01:36,510
for them.
Um,

1588
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,270
I need,
for me,

1589
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:40,430
it's just being on,
you know what I mean?

1590
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,140
Right.
Like you just have to be on all the

1591
01:01:42,141 --> 01:01:42,980
time.
You know?

1592
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:44,510
Um,
so the,

1593
01:01:44,511 --> 01:01:46,760
the being on part is nice to get away
from.

1594
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,003
Yeah,
I was,

1595
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,070
so,
it's kind of answering the questions,

1596
01:01:51,071 --> 01:01:52,780
but it's really just a matter of having
to like,

1597
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:56,260
you know,
navigating life and people staring at

1598
01:01:56,261 --> 01:01:59,740
you or wanting something from you or
thinking they want something from you

1599
01:01:59,741 --> 01:02:02,440
just because you're trained,
because too many people have wanted

1600
01:02:02,441 --> 01:02:03,570
something from you.
Right.

1601
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,690
Um,
to,

1602
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,310
you know,
just the demands of the things that

1603
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:07,900
you're doing and running around.
I mean,

1604
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:09,333
I,

1605
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,040
okay,

1606
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:12,620
I'm on an airplane twice a week doing
stuff,

1607
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:14,600
so it's,
you just get exhausted from that.

1608
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,320
Yeah.
That's not unhealthy either,

1609
01:02:16,321 --> 01:02:17,390
right?
Mm.

1610
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:20,310
Oh.
Do you feel like you're going to step

1611
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,890
away from public life when you stopped
racing?

1612
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,780
Do you gonna Fade into the problem?
Normalcy?

1613
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,073
No,
I don't think so.

1614
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,950
No.
I'd love to have a cooking show,

1615
01:02:29,951 --> 01:02:32,160
so a cooking show,
like I said,

1616
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:33,280
I love cooking.
Yeah.

1617
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:34,510
I'm a,
I'm like,

1618
01:02:34,511 --> 01:02:35,710
what kind of stuff?
Anything.

1619
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,770
I'm not much of a baker though.
That's because I'm a free spirit and

1620
01:02:39,771 --> 01:02:42,670
baking is all down to a science.
You're like,

1621
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:45,160
measure everything.
It's gotta be a certain temperature and

1622
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:46,990
I'm one of those.
Just dump it in a bowl.

1623
01:02:46,991 --> 01:02:50,080
Tasted does it need more sugar?
Does it need more acid as Nabi when

1624
01:02:50,081 --> 01:02:52,620
we're rich with fat,
does it need spice?

1625
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:53,980
Does it need,
what does it need?

1626
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:57,140
No.
Are you going off of books d take

1627
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:58,340
classes?
Like how'd you,

1628
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,183
how'd you learn how to cook?

1629
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:00,440
Well,
when I moved to England,

1630
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:03,560
when I was 16,
I live by myself eventually.

1631
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:06,290
Why did you do that?
Why'd you move to England to race?

1632
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:08,300
You were racing in England?
Yeah,

1633
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,010
I left high school and I was 16 and
moved to England and then I,

1634
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:13,610
I lived there for three years.
How do you parents handle that?

1635
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:18,290
I think my mom cried a lot.
I couldn't imagine but they couldn't.

1636
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,850
Um,
you know,

1637
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:23,900
they also couldn't imagine me not having
the opportunity so they let me go and I

1638
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,490
left high school.
So kind of racing.

1639
01:03:25,491 --> 01:03:28,760
Were you doing there?
The lowest level open wheel racing.

1640
01:03:28,761 --> 01:03:30,980
So what's that mean?
Open wheel just means that the wheels

1641
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:32,350
are exposed really.
Okay.

1642
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:34,430
Versus stock cars,
which are Nascar.

1643
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,460
I'm so open wheel wheel is open.
Um,

1644
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:40,160
so there was no wings on the cars that I
was driving over there at that point in

1645
01:03:40,161 --> 01:03:40,370
time.

1646
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:41,360
So it was just,
you know,

1647
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,940
no wing open wheel cars.
So I was just,

1648
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:45,470
you know,
starting my,

1649
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,320
starting my career really.
Cause from go-carts I will,

1650
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,010
I didn't want to be a professional go
drivers.

1651
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,170
So I,
I was like,

1652
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,970
I'll just get into cars as soon as I
can.

1653
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:58,130
How'd this come up?
Well I was 14 and I was at the

1654
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:02,810
Indianapolis Motor speedway and I went
into a suite and there was some British

1655
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:05,450
dude in there.
And so I started asking about cars and

1656
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,130
again,
we're at the race track.

1657
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:08,211
Um,
and this,

1658
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,550
this family that he works for has a
team,

1659
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,490
has a race team.
And so I guess I asked all the right

1660
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:14,420
questions.
And,

1661
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,030
um,
two years later,

1662
01:04:17,031 --> 01:04:19,490
when I was 16,
they asked me and my dad to come back to

1663
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:22,670
indy and meet with them and talk about
going over to England a race.

1664
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,580
And they said I could learn more in one
year in England,

1665
01:04:25,581 --> 01:04:28,640
then five years in America.
And it was not true at all,

1666
01:04:28,641 --> 01:04:30,660
but I did it anyway.
Um,

1667
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,870
English people please.
Crazy pompous.

1668
01:04:32,871 --> 01:04:34,010
No,
get the fuck out of here.

1669
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:36,110
I'm,
I'm,

1670
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:38,240
I might make England people from England
mad,

1671
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:40,790
but there's not many that I've liked.
Whoa.

1672
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,250
Yeah.
I love English people the opposite.

1673
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:44,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

1674
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:47,450
I maybe it was just my environment.
Like they,

1675
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:50,090
that no one,
no one kept in touch after I left and

1676
01:04:50,091 --> 01:04:53,120
lived there for three years and no one
kept in touch with me at all.

1677
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,770
Hmm.
Maybe you were too intense for English

1678
01:04:54,771 --> 01:04:55,730
people.
Hmm.

1679
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,700
Well they also have like,
like this is where you are and this is

1680
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:01,690
where you stay.
You have like a very like rigid class

1681
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:02,910
butchers there.
Oh,

1682
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:04,280
well amy.
Yeah.

1683
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,640
Yeah.
I have friends that moved to California

1684
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:10,790
from England and they are like,
the people over here are so much more

1685
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:11,624
optimistic about it.

1686
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,950
An open minded,
right.

1687
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:13,281
Like,
I mean,

1688
01:05:13,281 --> 01:05:15,590
just like bring you in and prove me
wrong.

1689
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,980
Instead of like prove to me,
I gotta be your friend.

1690
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,800
You know,
it's kind of a European mentality.

1691
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,760
A little bit more guarded.

1692
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:24,700
Well,
also being a 16 year old girl,

1693
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:28,750
living there by yourself,
not knowing anybody that had to be

1694
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,570
really weird.
I grew a lot.

1695
01:05:30,571 --> 01:05:34,230
So I learned more there in one year than
five years in America.

1696
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,180
From a personal standpoint.
See,

1697
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:38,580
I went over there and I was very open
and

1698
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:43,080
unguarded and would tell anyone
anything.

1699
01:05:43,081 --> 01:05:45,250
And you know,
how'd that work out for it?

1700
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,340
It didn't work out very well.
I got hurt a lot.

1701
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:51,270
I hated men after that.
Um,

1702
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,110
and uh,

1703
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,870
English accents.
Now like when you get from men,

1704
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,793
I can obey.

1705
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:58,550
Talk a little bit.
We'll do a little bit.

1706
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,660
Yeah,
I'm a little scarred.

1707
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:01,201
Um,
but,

1708
01:06:01,201 --> 01:06:01,840
uh,
anyway,

1709
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:05,540
I came home and my parents describe me
as very cold when I came home.

1710
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:06,890
Very guarded,
very cold.

1711
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:09,220
Did you guys visit back and forth
between them?

1712
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,860
I would come home like twice a year and
they would come over once or twice a

1713
01:06:12,861 --> 01:06:13,491
year.
Oh,

1714
01:06:13,491 --> 01:06:15,620
so it wasn't alienation.
Yeah.

1715
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:16,483
Yes.
You know,

1716
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:17,990
but,
but they said you were cold when he got

1717
01:06:17,991 --> 01:06:18,824
back.
Yeah.

1718
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:20,210
You became hard.
Yup.

1719
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:21,680
Yup.
Yeah.

1720
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:23,210
Fuck that.
I know.

1721
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,330
Yeah.

1722
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:26,610
One of the hardest things in life is
figuring out who you really are.

1723
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,180
Like what you really enjoy,
who you are as a person,

1724
01:06:30,181 --> 01:06:34,020
what you stand for instead of what
culture is told you.

1725
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,300
What advice do you give someone that's
trying to do that?

1726
01:06:37,301 --> 01:06:38,830
Like I have a nephew,
he's a great kid,

1727
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:40,210
but he doesn't know what the fuck he
wants to do.

1728
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,950
He's trying to figure it out now.
Yeah,

1729
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:46,030
I mean the first quick couple of things
that you can do to identify what it is

1730
01:06:46,031 --> 01:06:51,031
that you're interested in and you know,
something that's true to you as um,

1731
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,710
you know,
just what do you do for your hobbies?

1732
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,700
That's very insightful.
What do you enjoy doing?

1733
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:59,020
If you were by yourselves,
there's a job for you.

1734
01:06:59,021 --> 01:07:02,250
I mean,
isn't it legal here in California now to

1735
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:04,270
sword.
So anyway,

1736
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,180
sort of legal,
it's like some guru farmer.

1737
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,800
Um,
and then,

1738
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:11,320
uh,
also this is like an odd one,

1739
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:14,230
but look at the phone,
look at the pictures on your phone or

1740
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,990
look at the pictures that you post on
social media maybe or something like

1741
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:18,970
that.
But whatever you take pictures is also

1742
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:21,130
kind of pretty insightful for what
you're interested in.

1743
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,780
Yeah.
Okay.

1744
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,330
You're not taking pictures of stuff that
you don't care about.

1745
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:25,960
No,
it's true.

1746
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:29,260
It's your phone.
What if you're all selfies or pictures?

1747
01:07:29,261 --> 01:07:33,550
Like,
well then I think your ego is very loud.

1748
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,670
Do you have any selfies on your phone?

1749
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:43,590
So the only,
the only reason why I selfies for me

1750
01:07:44,861 --> 01:07:46,230
are,
are Ah,

1751
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:49,540
you're so annoying.
But selfie stick.

1752
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,520
No,
no,

1753
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:51,851
no,
no,

1754
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:52,810
no.
But I,

1755
01:07:52,811 --> 01:07:55,780
the only way I do them as if I am kind
of promoting,

1756
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:58,030
right.
So for me it's a matter of promoting a

1757
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:00,910
healthy lifestyle.
So maybe it's me in the gym working out.

1758
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:04,420
Maybe it's something like that where I
can be like post a pit,

1759
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:08,440
like whatever workout I did.
And perhaps what you could look like if

1760
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:12,760
you did these workouts sort of sorta.
Maybe better really.

1761
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:14,340
I mean,
um,

1762
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,790
so you know,
those are why I would take a selfie or

1763
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:19,100
if it's with someone you really like,
you know,

1764
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:21,740
you can take a picture with someone.
That's something that I don't think that

1765
01:08:21,741 --> 01:08:24,260
does that count as a selfie if it's just
you wouldn't be doing someone else.

1766
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:25,010
No,
no.

1767
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,550
That's just being creative with how
you're getting a picture of you.

1768
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,121
Yeah.
So,

1769
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:29,990
yeah,
selfies,

1770
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:33,710
the only time I do it really is,
is pretty much just to promote either

1771
01:08:33,711 --> 01:08:38,000
like clothes I'm wearing for my clothing
line or like workout style stuff for my

1772
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:38,900
book.
But for me,

1773
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:40,220
I'm not like,
damn,

1774
01:08:40,221 --> 01:08:42,410
my hair looks good today and you know,
I,

1775
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,281
I'm like,
Ooh,

1776
01:08:43,281 --> 01:08:45,380
look at me and I say nothing.
Yeah,

1777
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,520
same.
Let's just,

1778
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,520
I don't know,
it's not ego driven.

1779
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,600
I know as a woman who is very ambitious
and successful and powerful,

1780
01:08:56,150 --> 01:09:00,950
what do you make of these social media
stars now that,

1781
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:03,290
that just do that?
They just stick their butt out and take

1782
01:09:03,291 --> 01:09:06,770
pictures and a lot,
a lot of that.

1783
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,120
It's a weird

1784
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,480
cells.
Yeah.

1785
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,100
And always will.
Yeah.

1786
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:12,353
Um,

1787
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,553
uh,

1788
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,960
yeah,
probably deal with it more emotionally

1789
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:19,810
yourself because it's a vicious circle
where you want more,

1790
01:09:19,811 --> 01:09:21,580
so you have to keep doing more.
Right.

1791
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,990
You know what I mean?
And you end up dead,

1792
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:26,230
you end up in a place where you don't
know yourself anymore cause you're doing

1793
01:09:26,231 --> 01:09:29,170
it to fulfill someone else's wants and
desires more than yours.

1794
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:32,940
Yeah.
Right after going to the next level,

1795
01:09:32,941 --> 01:09:33,990
right.
You have to keep your like,

1796
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:37,920
oh I wore this like super cute like
leggings and a sports bra.

1797
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:41,550
Now I got to wear a body suit and now
I'm wearing a thong and only crap.

1798
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:43,140
You know,
like look at me now I'm,

1799
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:45,590
yeah,
what do you do?

1800
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:46,340
What?
Yeah,

1801
01:09:46,340 --> 01:09:50,600
who are you and after it like,
but some of it's oddly successful.

1802
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:54,200
It's gone to some of them,
their pages of like 17 million

1803
01:09:54,201 --> 01:09:54,580
followers.

1804
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:55,990
Well whoa.
Yeah,

1805
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,040
yeah.
Whoa.

1806
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,810
I mean,
well what it did of course.

1807
01:09:58,811 --> 01:10:02,110
Then it begs the question like what is
your definition of success then?

1808
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,930
Yeah.
Cause if you don't make money off 17

1809
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,300
million followers,
then what's the point?

1810
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:10,030
I think they do though.
They do like sponsored posts and stuff

1811
01:10:10,031 --> 01:10:10,864
like that.
Okay.

1812
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,070
I mean I agree.
That's why,

1813
01:10:12,071 --> 01:10:13,570
again,
you have to go to the next level all the

1814
01:10:13,571 --> 01:10:18,571
time to get more people kind of feeds
the ego's getting fed.

1815
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:23,830
But as a woman who's an attractive woman
who's also very ambitious,

1816
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,070
like you could have just been one of
those things,

1817
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,440
right?
Like you like

1818
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:31,980
when you see someone,
I mean,

1819
01:10:31,981 --> 01:10:33,540
man,
I don't think men look at it this way

1820
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:38,340
because I don't think there's a lot of
guys that like look at guys who just do

1821
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:41,790
like workout instagrams or something
like that and they get look at this

1822
01:10:41,791 --> 01:10:44,370
before from God.
How about use your brains protein

1823
01:10:44,371 --> 01:10:48,750
powder,
but as a woman who you mean you're not

1824
01:10:48,751 --> 01:10:50,670
falling back on your looks is what I'm
trying to say.

1825
01:10:50,730 --> 01:10:53,400
It's like you have them but you,
that's just a part of you.

1826
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:56,100
You're obviously hyper ambitious on top
of that.

1827
01:10:56,101 --> 01:10:59,850
When you see someone who's just,
do you feel like they're like wasting

1828
01:10:59,851 --> 01:11:01,500
time or do you feel like that's just
them?

1829
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:05,280
I just feel like it's immaturity.
Yeah.

1830
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:07,140
I mean,
if that's your driving forces,

1831
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:10,470
just your looks and you know,
but there are some that have some

1832
01:11:10,471 --> 01:11:11,670
content,
but you know,

1833
01:11:11,671 --> 01:11:14,370
and they can use it to drive a message.
Um,

1834
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,020
I mean there's some that I've noticed
like that,

1835
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,360
that really do have really positive
messages.

1836
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,510
I'm spreading positivity,
spreading good things,

1837
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:22,440
but,
um,

1838
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,090
promoting good things.
But,

1839
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:25,770
um,
for those who aren't,

1840
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:28,470
then I just think it's a level of
immaturity.

1841
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:29,820
Um,
and it's going to come to,

1842
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,760
I think it will come to bite them
eventually because it's,

1843
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:35,790
where does the road lead to

1844
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,600
yeah.
It's a short lived success.

1845
01:11:37,601 --> 01:11:38,434
Yeah.
Yeah.

1846
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:42,640
Somebody said this once,
it's a really great quote that beauty is

1847
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:45,980
a short lived tyranny.
Hm.

1848
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,500
Yeah.
You know,

1849
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:52,780
um,
kind of leads me to a little bit of a s

1850
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,180
one similar,
like the,

1851
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,280
I'm not going to get it right,
exactly.

1852
01:11:56,281 --> 01:11:57,170
But it's the,
uh,

1853
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:01,290
the ego is impatient because it knows
it's time is limited where the soul is

1854
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:02,121
patient because it,
no,

1855
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:03,450
it has,
it knows it has forever.

1856
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:04,440
Huh.

1857
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,690
Ooh,
we should like have memes on like a

1858
01:12:06,691 --> 01:12:07,524
stripper's instagram.

1859
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,480
Perfect.
Yeah,

1860
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,730
absolutely.
Kind of intrusion when the ego needs to

1861
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:13,020
be fed immediately.
You know,

1862
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:16,740
the ego wants something now and it's not
thinking about the long term or it's

1863
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:18,540
true.
No sole decisions are,

1864
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:20,790
you know,
perhaps on realized for a store for an

1865
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:22,320
amount of time.
But you know,

1866
01:12:22,321 --> 01:12:26,300
the truth will always come through.
And so if you're not living it,

1867
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,410
you're going to have a transition.

1868
01:12:28,730 --> 01:12:32,240
Now when you make like a,
if you put like an instagram post up of

1869
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:35,060
workouts and stuff like that,
do you do that specifically because

1870
01:12:35,061 --> 01:12:36,480
you're trying to motivate people?
Yeah.

1871
01:12:36,710 --> 01:12:38,000
Yeah.
Cause it does for me.

1872
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:40,040
I mean,
when I see somebody hot working out and

1873
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:41,540
see a picture of him,
I'm like,

1874
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:41,961
God,
it there,

1875
01:12:41,961 --> 01:12:43,400
get to the gym.
Yeah.

1876
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:45,140
There you get working out.
Oh maybe put that,

1877
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,740
put that chocolate down.
Yeah,

1878
01:12:47,050 --> 01:12:48,260
I agree.
I think that,

1879
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,061
I mean,
people,

1880
01:12:49,061 --> 01:12:52,810
especially people in my line of work,
comedians love to mock things along

1881
01:12:52,811 --> 01:12:56,020
those lines.
But I take inspiration off of a lot of

1882
01:12:56,021 --> 01:12:56,854
people online.
Right.

1883
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,211
And I,
you know,

1884
01:12:58,211 --> 01:13:01,420
my overwhelm,
like overall what I hope for people too

1885
01:13:01,421 --> 01:13:02,530
is that,
um,

1886
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,280
with,
um,

1887
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,600
with the book I wrote,
I,

1888
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,190
I just,
I really want people to find confidence

1889
01:13:09,191 --> 01:13:12,940
in themselves and develop a healthier
relationship with food and exercise.

1890
01:13:12,941 --> 01:13:15,010
And I think most people think of food as
a punishment,

1891
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:15,521
right?
They're like,

1892
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:17,980
oh my God,
I'll just eat this terrible vegetable.

1893
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,490
Or they'll like have to work out the
socks were working out,

1894
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:23,500
can be fun.
Working out can make you feel good.

1895
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:26,290
Food can also make you feel good.
Food is medicine.

1896
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:31,090
Food will make you not only feel good
but be good and I'm look better.

1897
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,800
So I'm so,
you know,

1898
01:13:32,801 --> 01:13:34,900
I,
I really hope that in all of my

1899
01:13:34,901 --> 01:13:37,870
motivation,
it drives people into a direction where

1900
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:41,170
they feel good about it all.
And there's a,

1901
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:43,180
there's,
there's more positivity around it.

1902
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:46,810
Don't you feel like there's so much
negativity around eating healthy and

1903
01:13:46,811 --> 01:13:48,850
working out?
There's so many people that just hate

1904
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:49,430
it.

1905
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:51,830
There's quite a bit of that,
but I think there's a lot of positivity

1906
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:56,390
around it too.
I think that people are recognizing more

1907
01:13:56,391 --> 01:14:01,391
and more today the benefits of eating
healthy in terms of like psychological

1908
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:04,130
benefits like your,
your mind works better,

1909
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:07,130
physical benefits.
You feel better about your choices.

1910
01:14:07,131 --> 01:14:09,170
You feel better about your momentum in
life.

1911
01:14:09,171 --> 01:14:09,531
Like,
Hey,

1912
01:14:09,531 --> 01:14:10,610
I'm on the right path.
I'm,

1913
01:14:10,910 --> 01:14:13,240
I'm healthy,
I'm taking supplements,

1914
01:14:13,241 --> 01:14:17,590
I'm working on a regular basis.
My body feels I've got more energy.

1915
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,873
It's tuned in.
Right?

1916
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,820
I mean,
I remember when I cut out dairy and

1917
01:14:20,821 --> 01:14:25,821
gluten years ago and my energy level
finally was up and consistent where

1918
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,980
before it'd be like the random day where
you're like,

1919
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:30,750
man,
why am I so exhausted today?

1920
01:14:30,751 --> 01:14:32,490
I'm just so tired.
Yeah.

1921
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:34,230
It didn't have any of those days
anymore.

1922
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:35,590
Yeah.

1923
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:40,590
When people eat a lot of refined
carbohydrates and then shift to a diet

1924
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:44,230
that has none of that stuff in it,
it's stunning.

1925
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:44,781
Yeah.
The,

1926
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:48,310
the effect that it has on your mid day.
I always tell people like if do you need

1927
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:50,710
a nap in the middle of the day?
If you're one of those people,

1928
01:14:50,711 --> 01:14:52,750
just try,
cut out your sugar,

1929
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,350
cut out your refined carbohydrates,
and then watch what happens.

1930
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,160
Yeah,
you will.

1931
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:58,630
You will have so much more energy during
the,

1932
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:00,370
not a Napper,
that's for sure.

1933
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:01,061
Yeah.
I mean,

1934
01:15:01,061 --> 01:15:03,580
maybe I like coffee,
but are you one of those four hours of

1935
01:15:03,581 --> 01:15:04,960
sleep at night people?
Actually,

1936
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:06,370
I can.
I don't need a lot.

1937
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:09,820
I wake up with the sunlight too,
so I'm one of those people and I wake up

1938
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:11,440
in the morning and like,
I see the light going on.

1939
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:12,280
I'm like,
ah,

1940
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:13,720
it's morning.
Is it morning?

1941
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,130
I'm so excited.
If it's morning,

1942
01:15:15,131 --> 01:15:17,560
I'm ready.
I love the morning and I'm very chatty

1943
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,350
and I'm very like up and ready to go and
like,

1944
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,500
are you awake?
Yes.

1945
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:25,000
Are you awake?
You are now me coffee.

1946
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:26,070
Do you want breakfast?
Come on,

1947
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:28,390
let's go rotten.
That's me.

1948
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:32,380
I'm really annoyingly up and ready to go
and happy in the morning.

1949
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,450
I love the morning.
How are you at night though?

1950
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,440
Sleepy.
Huh?

1951
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,510
Okay.
I'm okay.

1952
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:41,770
But once I get horizontal at night,
it's over.

1953
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:44,200
Like I'm falling asleep.
You have no insomnia.

1954
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:46,000
No,
no.

1955
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,870
Yeah,
I don't think so.

1956
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:48,970
No,
I have before.

1957
01:15:48,971 --> 01:15:50,290
It's awful.
Yeah,

1958
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,060
that sucks.
That's not good.

1959
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:53,050
But I don't,
I don't have it.

1960
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:53,531
No,
no,

1961
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:53,840
no.
I,

1962
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,673
I'm,
I'm,

1963
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:57,010
but once I lay down at night and I'm
tired

1964
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:59,780
now what kind of Diet do you follow?
Do you have a specific,

1965
01:15:59,781 --> 01:16:00,950
you said no.
Gluten,

1966
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:02,350
no dairy,
dairy.

1967
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:04,520
And then a couple of years ago,
um,

1968
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:05,503
I,
uh,

1969
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,460
so I,
uh,

1970
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:12,170
I did an IVF treatment to freeze my eggs
because I'm getting older and I drive

1971
01:16:12,171 --> 01:16:13,830
race cars and I can't,
you know,

1972
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,350
do any of that stuff.
So I was like,

1973
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:17,270
look,
I'm going for the insurance policy here.

1974
01:16:17,271 --> 01:16:19,640
So what are they,
how do they get those out of there?

1975
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,190
Okay.
Does he really want to know?

1976
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:23,840
Yeah.
It's a weird method.

1977
01:16:23,841 --> 01:16:24,590
Right?
All right.

1978
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:27,440
So you have a ton of shots for like a
month,

1979
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:28,940
a ton of shots,
ton of shots.

1980
01:16:28,941 --> 01:16:31,820
Every day you stick them in your stomach
and you have a ton of shots.

1981
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:35,240
And so they dropped your estrogen down
to nothing.

1982
01:16:35,241 --> 01:16:39,740
And then they ramp it up and then it
multiplies the follicles.

1983
01:16:39,950 --> 01:16:44,450
The follicles are what grows the egg.
So you go in after a while and you start

1984
01:16:44,451 --> 01:16:47,720
getting ultrasounds to see how many
follicles are growing on each side.

1985
01:16:47,721 --> 01:16:49,130
So,
um,

1986
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:50,900
anyway,
it was good for me.

1987
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:54,080
Um,
but that many grows and they want them

1988
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:58,070
each to get to like one by basically
almost an inch by an inch,

1989
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,990
each of them.
And I mean I had like,

1990
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:02,120
I mean this is a lot of information,
but you know,

1991
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,980
20 to 30 on each side.
That's a shitload of real estate in my

1992
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:10,250
body.
It got very 30

1993
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,410
inches on each side of the each one.
Yeah.

1994
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:13,140
Like,
well,

1995
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:14,690
did people think you were pregnant?
Yeah.

1996
01:17:14,691 --> 01:17:16,490
You do.
You look like three,

1997
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:17,810
ma.
I mean it was huge.

1998
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:20,300
I was so uncomfortable feeling all them
eggs in there.

1999
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:23,860
It's horrible.
This is bobby.

2000
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,630
You're number seven.
This is Mike.

2001
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,140
I'm pretty sure they're all girls.
Um,

2002
01:17:31,210 --> 01:17:32,860
but uh,
it's um,

2003
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,940
so I did that and they,
you do this trigger drug thing and then

2004
01:17:36,941 --> 01:17:39,430
you know,
36 hours on the minute you go in and you

2005
01:17:39,431 --> 01:17:41,200
retrieve it.
And what they do is they,

2006
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:46,030
you get wheeled in the room is super
like humid and warm.

2007
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:51,080
They runkle and um,
so animal wild things in there.

2008
01:17:51,761 --> 01:17:56,761
So they put you in like they put you in
like ski boots,

2009
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:02,010
like tills get you get you up and ready.
And then some chick was like,

2010
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:03,770
right,
I'm going to give you a little,

2011
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,790
little something.

2012
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,211
Actually.
I'm like,

2013
01:18:05,211 --> 01:18:06,080
girl,
you don't have to tell me.

2014
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,480
Just do it.
Like that was what I told her and I was

2015
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:11,960
asleep.
And they go in and every they go in with

2016
01:18:11,961 --> 01:18:16,640
a needle and retrieve every one of them
one by one with a needle,

2017
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,593
I think.
Yeah.

2018
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:23,110
They go in and puncture in through the,
through it and retrieve them sucked out

2019
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:30,521
of their 24 and 19,
19 where mature 19 potential.

2020
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:37,490
How do you think you're going to make?
Have you thought about it?

2021
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,740
No,
no.

2022
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:44,300
They say you need 20 to guarantee one.
So pretty much guaranteed one.

2023
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:47,030
Wow.
But this is an insurance policy.

2024
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:50,360
It doesn't mean I can try a different
way if I wanted to,

2025
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:52,123
but anyway.
So,

2026
01:18:52,130 --> 01:18:53,630
okay.
Back to the back to the point,

2027
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:56,810
like we just got way off track here,
but this is part of the story as to why

2028
01:18:56,811 --> 01:19:00,920
I decided to change my diet and my
workout and why I ended up writing a

2029
01:19:00,921 --> 01:19:01,960
book,
um,

2030
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:04,280
was because I,
I gained like four pounds.

2031
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:04,850
Okay.
Um,

2032
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:06,350
just people I know there's people were
like,

2033
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:06,801
well,
who cares?

2034
01:19:06,801 --> 01:19:11,000
Four pounds on my frame,
five foot who I'm small little.

2035
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,980
And you know,
for any girl out there,

2036
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,720
you know,
your genes only fit when you're exactly

2037
01:19:14,721 --> 01:19:17,810
the size that you are and then you gain
a couple pounds and they don't anymore.

2038
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,400
I was just uncomfortable.
It just wasn't,

2039
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,310
I just gained some weight and not
anything really.

2040
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,410
Well it was,
it was,

2041
01:19:24,411 --> 01:19:26,960
it was legit.
Like I just gained some weight because

2042
01:19:26,961 --> 01:19:29,660
of the hormones.
So it instantly also gave me some

2043
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:34,640
sympathy for people out there with
whether it's dudes and testosterone or

2044
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:37,610
women with pregnancy or you know,
um,

2045
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:40,640
uh,
menopause or whatever it is that changes

2046
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:42,710
their hormones.
And sometimes you just gain weight.

2047
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:43,610
I'm like,
Oh my God,

2048
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,350
this is,
this is real.

2049
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:50,090
This isn't just some excuse for getting
older and being lax about your diet or

2050
01:19:50,091 --> 01:19:51,740
your exercise,
it really happens.

2051
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:55,490
And so anyways,
so I decided to eat Paleo for like a

2052
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:56,630
week.
Really.

2053
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:59,120
I was going to do it for a week and I
did it,

2054
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:00,320
um,
and I never stopped.

2055
01:20:00,321 --> 01:20:03,980
So that was two years ago.
And then I also started doing two a day

2056
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:08,250
workouts because I wanted to change it
up and sort of kick things up a notch.

2057
01:20:08,251 --> 01:20:11,790
But I also realized that I was out
taking my dogs for walks and I was like,

2058
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,620
well,
if I'm walking them I might as well run

2059
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:15,060
and do a workout too.
So,

2060
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,090
you know,
instead of mile and a half of walking

2061
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:20,190
around the property,
I would go for three.

2062
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,450
Wow.
So when you,

2063
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,760
you say you do two a days,
like how do you break it up?

2064
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:26,510
Um,
they're usually a little shorter.

2065
01:20:26,511 --> 01:20:29,810
Like I would say somewhere between 20 to
40 minutes each.

2066
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,580
And um,
uh,

2067
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:33,740
one of them will be,
I do upper body,

2068
01:20:33,741 --> 01:20:37,460
lower body and an ab day and I just
rotate through those.

2069
01:20:37,461 --> 01:20:38,294
Really.
I just,

2070
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,850
I keep rotating through those because
look,

2071
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:42,320
if you do,
if I do it right,

2072
01:20:42,321 --> 01:20:45,110
I'm so sore,
I can't do upper body again for a few

2073
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:47,140
days.
So I just rotate through those in a nice

2074
01:20:47,141 --> 01:20:48,380
supplement.
And if I have time,

2075
01:20:48,381 --> 01:20:50,480
I do interval.
I'm running,

2076
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:53,510
we're all like sprint for 30 seconds,
walk for 30 seconds,

2077
01:20:53,511 --> 01:20:55,250
Sprint for 30 s and I'll do that for 20
minutes.

2078
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,240
And do you have someone train you or do
you do everything yourself?

2079
01:20:58,330 --> 01:20:59,320
No,
I do everything myself.

2080
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:00,760
I write,
I write,

2081
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:03,790
I love writing workouts.
I think it's the artistic side of me.

2082
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:08,791
I like the balance and the flow of like
creating something that has fluidity and

2083
01:21:08,831 --> 01:21:11,320
make sense and there's good transitions
through movements.

2084
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:12,460
So,
um,

2085
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:14,320
I mean I see your big rogue jim going
in,

2086
01:21:14,321 --> 01:21:14,951
so I,
uh,

2087
01:21:14,951 --> 01:21:17,180
I be happy to program for you if you
want me to,

2088
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:20,010
but it's going to frost,
crossfit style workouts.

2089
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:21,040
Well,
I do a lot.

2090
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,790
Like I said,
I don't do crossfit,

2091
01:21:22,791 --> 01:21:24,960
but most of the stuff I do is kettle
bells.

2092
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:26,060
Yeah.
Dead lifts.

2093
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:29,150
Chin ups.
Yeah.

2094
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:29,811
Too many.
I,

2095
01:21:29,811 --> 01:21:32,990
I got a what's called Waffles Golf
Golfer's elbow.

2096
01:21:32,991 --> 01:21:35,660
Tell me about it.
My right elbow is feeling so sore for

2097
01:21:35,661 --> 01:21:37,190
like three days.
Is it right on?

2098
01:21:37,191 --> 01:21:39,050
Yeah.
It's like right on the side.

2099
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:42,740
It's like right here.
It just got to give a shout out to Kelly

2100
01:21:42,741 --> 01:21:45,620
start.
He hooked me up with this crazy protocol

2101
01:21:45,621 --> 01:21:48,410
for a healing up my tendonitis.
What is it?

2102
01:21:48,411 --> 01:21:49,440
Is it legal started?
Yeah.

2103
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:51,920
Yeah,
yeah.

2104
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:53,360
It's uh,
mostly,

2105
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:54,580
do you know who he is?
He's a,

2106
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,920
the guy wrote that book becoming a
supple leopard and he's a,

2107
01:21:57,921 --> 01:22:02,330
a real wizard when it comes to like
exercise physiology and understanding

2108
01:22:02,331 --> 01:22:05,990
the body and his book's amazing and all
that new and improved modalities and

2109
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,430
yeah,
he's,

2110
01:22:07,550 --> 01:22:11,060
he gave me a bunch of different things
but also a tool to scrape the area which

2111
01:22:11,061 --> 01:22:13,940
is going to be proud of like a blade,
like a metal.

2112
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,290
Okay.
I've had that done before.

2113
01:22:15,291 --> 01:22:18,320
Yeah.
And topical CBD oil,

2114
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,770
which is really good.
Legal.

2115
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,550
Yes.
Yes.

2116
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,470
CBD is illegal across the board.
Okay.

2117
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,170
Non Non psychoactive.
But the FDA is trying to stop that.

2118
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:28,740
Of course.
Follow the money.

2119
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:30,550
Yeah.
Was creeps tiny.

2120
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,510
It's a good explanation for just about
everything.

2121
01:22:32,511 --> 01:22:33,830
Yeah.
They're trying to put it in the same

2122
01:22:33,831 --> 01:22:35,840
classification as heroin.
It's hilarious.

2123
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:37,190
Yeah.
So stupid.

2124
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:39,620
It's just 100% pharmaceutical drug
companies,

2125
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,700
institutions of decision making.
Yup.

2126
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:43,220
Well,
it's just creepy.

2127
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:46,130
People with money that don't want to
lose money to cbd oil because it's so

2128
01:22:46,131 --> 01:22:50,590
much better for you and healthy and
natural and does the exact same page and

2129
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:54,620
how much the drug companies would lose
if Lorne gain,

2130
01:22:54,621 --> 01:22:58,310
if they started selling it fucks.
It's just they want to monopolize it.

2131
01:22:58,311 --> 01:23:00,280
That's the problem.
They want to patents.

2132
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:02,660
They want to be able to patent things.
You know?

2133
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,040
That's,
but that's,

2134
01:23:04,041 --> 01:23:06,010
uh,
like were talking about before about the

2135
01:23:06,011 --> 01:23:07,360
things that are in the Amazon.
I mean,

2136
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:08,330
it stayed,
there's,

2137
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:13,240
there so many different plants that can
deal with so many different ailments

2138
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:15,400
that people have.
But I,

2139
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:16,390
Alaska,
yeah,

2140
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,740
that's one of them.
Sure.

2141
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:19,450
Have you done it?
I haven't,

2142
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:21,120
but it's interesting.
Yeah.

2143
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,630
Have you done any psychedelics?
No.

2144
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:24,250
No.
Never done drugs ever.

2145
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,790
No drugs,
no pot ever?

2146
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:26,840
Never.
Oh,

2147
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:27,674
you scared?

2148
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,540
No,
I just,

2149
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,450
my dad's scared the living daylights out
of me when I was a kid and he told me

2150
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:32,950
that if I ever,
he's like,

2151
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,730
you get tested for drugs and you fail,
you,

2152
01:23:34,731 --> 01:23:37,150
you won't ever be a race car driver.
You told me that about drinking and

2153
01:23:37,151 --> 01:23:38,060
driving too.
If you get,

2154
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:40,000
if you lose your license,
you won't be able to race.

2155
01:23:40,001 --> 01:23:41,110
And then,
you know,

2156
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:42,910
what are you going to be when you grow
up then?

2157
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:44,560
You know,
he threatened me with,

2158
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:48,450
Oh dad,
it's remedial remedial jobs and um,

2159
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,320
yeah.
So He'd scared the living daylights out

2160
01:23:50,321 --> 01:23:52,300
of me.
Truth be told you can lose your license.

2161
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:53,500
Still raise.
Also,

2162
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:56,830
truth be told,
I didn't get drug tested until way

2163
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,540
later,
but we do get drug tests.

2164
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:02,430
You're running a drug farm.
Oh,

2165
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:04,890
well one you're wanting to drug farm.
Well,

2166
01:24:04,891 --> 01:24:08,910
kind of I guess a drug farm lady.
It's legal buck 20 a hundred percent

2167
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:10,380
drug farm.
It's wonderful,

2168
01:24:10,381 --> 01:24:15,381
delicious taste in drugs.
It sure is fucked up on wine.

2169
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:16,740
Yeah.
And what does that,

2170
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:19,580
that's true.
And addicted to drinking alcoholism.

2171
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:22,190
I mean there's a lot of other things
that you can do that

2172
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,810
altering,
that aren't addictive,

2173
01:24:24,811 --> 01:24:26,940
right?
You're running a plant based drug farm.

2174
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,980
100% cash crops.
Yeah.

2175
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:30,870
So you're doing,
you're a drug dealer.

2176
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,790
Well,
let's just go all the way.

2177
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:34,350
Well,
if I was going to do something,

2178
01:24:34,351 --> 01:24:35,580
what would be the first thing I would
do?

2179
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:36,330
Pot.
Oh,

2180
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,170
for sure.
Okay.

2181
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,610
Nice and light.
Real slow.

2182
01:24:38,611 --> 01:24:40,710
Don't take much.
How quick does that mean?

2183
01:24:40,711 --> 01:24:42,360
Don't take much.
It just take a little bit.

2184
01:24:42,361 --> 01:24:44,760
You don't want to freak out.
The one of the major problems that

2185
01:24:44,761 --> 01:24:46,320
people have when they first start
smoking pot,

2186
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:50,730
they'll take like two or three heads and
he can take one when one like that's it.

2187
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:52,200
Put it down,
right Jamie?

2188
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:53,610
Yeah.
Jamie will tell you,

2189
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:55,490
okay,
we'll hit walkaway.

2190
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:57,290
Yeah,
don't fuck with edibles.

2191
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,100
Leave those alone.
Those,

2192
01:24:59,101 --> 01:25:00,790
those,
you need to build up to those things.

2193
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:02,970
So those are,
those are completely different

2194
01:25:02,971 --> 01:25:03,790
experience.

2195
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,960
Experienced users.
While it's not just that even

2196
01:25:06,961 --> 01:25:09,630
experienced users,
they don't recognize the fact that it's

2197
01:25:09,631 --> 01:25:11,610
a completely different psychoactive
ingredient.

2198
01:25:11,611 --> 01:25:12,540
Yeah,
yeah.

2199
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:15,090
When thc,
thc,

2200
01:25:15,150 --> 01:25:17,070
no,
when it's processed by your liver

2201
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:21,030
produces 11 hydroxy metabolite,
which is four to five times more

2202
01:25:21,031 --> 01:25:23,520
psychoactive than thc.
It's way more potent.

2203
01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:24,331
Whoa.
Yeah.

2204
01:25:24,331 --> 01:25:27,890
Which is why people for reek out when
they eat edibles and they just don't,

2205
01:25:27,891 --> 01:25:29,750
don't eat the whole Brownie.
No.

2206
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:34,710
Just a couple crumbs and then don't even
think about having any more for at least

2207
01:25:34,711 --> 01:25:36,720
two hours and let it settle in.
Let it,

2208
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:37,020
yeah,

2209
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:38,970
give yourself time.
Don't freak out for 15,

2210
01:25:38,971 --> 01:25:40,680
20 minutes and be like,
it's not working.

2211
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:41,630
Right.
Don't do that.

2212
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:45,000
Sometimes when I'm drinking I'm like,
I'm sure man,

2213
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:47,010
this is my third drank.
It just doesn't seem to be working.

2214
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:48,420
And then I hit it harder and then,
um,

2215
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:52,670
I don't remember anything.
Brownout or blackout or drugs or do

2216
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:53,341
drugs.
Yeah.

2217
01:25:53,341 --> 01:25:55,680
Actually one of the,
one of the first times I heard one of

2218
01:25:55,681 --> 01:25:56,820
your podcasts,
I think it was,

2219
01:25:56,821 --> 01:25:57,870
it was about dmt.

2220
01:25:58,030 --> 01:26:01,930
Yeah.
That's the motherlode DMT is the

2221
01:26:01,931 --> 01:26:06,450
psychoactive ingredient that's in Io
Osca and it's the most potent side.

2222
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:09,360
That seems like a cleaner,
cleaner way to do it as opposed to

2223
01:26:09,361 --> 01:26:11,670
Iowasca where you throw up and shit.

2224
01:26:11,930 --> 01:26:12,763
Yeah,
yeah,

2225
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:15,260
yeah.
It's definitely probably,

2226
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:16,610
uh,
it's also quicker,

2227
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,380
you know,
like the worst,

2228
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,750
the longest it's going to take a sec,
15 or 20 minutes,

2229
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:24,560
but there are some places that are doing
it now where they're doing an

2230
01:26:24,561 --> 01:26:27,530
intravenously.
So those trips are apparently,

2231
01:26:27,531 --> 01:26:28,850
that was how they did it.
And,

2232
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:31,130
um,
there's a book called DMT,

2233
01:26:31,131 --> 01:26:33,320
the spirit molecule molecule by this
guy,

2234
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:35,660
Doctor Rick Strassman,
who did all these studies out of the

2235
01:26:35,661 --> 01:26:37,580
University of New Mexico.
And,

2236
01:26:37,581 --> 01:26:38,840
uh,
they were the first,

2237
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:41,660
uh,
FDA approved clinical studies,

2238
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,200
but it was a group of people.
Yeah,

2239
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:45,260
he did it awesome.
Then about that.

2240
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,490
It's amazing.
It was amazing,

2241
01:26:46,491 --> 01:26:49,220
but they didn't intervene intravenously.
Yeah.

2242
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:52,520
And they were gone.
So for like 40 minutes,

2243
01:26:52,521 --> 01:26:56,120
like pull them off into the office to
the other dimension.

2244
01:26:56,460 --> 01:26:58,290
I was going to say,
so other dimension,

2245
01:26:58,291 --> 01:26:59,400
right?
This dream state,

2246
01:26:59,401 --> 01:27:00,870
is it,
what do you think is like a dream state?

2247
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:03,020
Uh,
it's very similar because they believe

2248
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:07,040
that your brain during heavy rem sleep
also produces dmt.

2249
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:09,870
May think that's cause we all have it.
We all had the empty,

2250
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:11,220
everybody has it.
Yeah.

2251
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:13,260
Yeah.
Everybody has recurring and everyone.

2252
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:15,410
Yes.
It's produced by your liver,

2253
01:27:15,411 --> 01:27:19,310
your lungs,
and now they know it's also produced at

2254
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:23,660
least in rats by your pineal gland,
which is literally your third eye.

2255
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:28,160
It's actually in certain reptiles.
It actually has a retina and the lens

2256
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:29,390
it's,
yeah.

2257
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,021
Yeah,
it is.

2258
01:27:30,021 --> 01:27:33,320
It is an eye.
I'm always trying to decalcify my

2259
01:27:33,321 --> 01:27:34,070
opinion.
Will Glenn,

2260
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:35,820
is that real?
I don't know.

2261
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,180
You get that from them crystal people in
Sedona?

2262
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:41,540
Yeah.
They say it's like fluoride.

2263
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:44,540
Fluoride is calcifying your pineal gland
man.

2264
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:45,240
Like,
okay,

2265
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,820
watch a cool thing like getting in
there.

2266
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

2267
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:50,520
How's it getting through my mouth and I
said,

2268
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:52,240
are you sure?
Are you sure Florence?

2269
01:27:52,241 --> 01:27:56,710
Because nothing you are what you eat.
Sordo but are you what you drink?

2270
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:59,690
You wine?
Yes.

2271
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,690
Yes.
I get better with age de.

2272
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,470
Yeah.
I don't know if you've really,

2273
01:28:06,471 --> 01:28:10,010
your pineal gland actually gets
calcified by fluoride in drinking water.

2274
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:12,260
I didn't.
That sounds like some hippie horseshit.

2275
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,840
It does sound hippie horse shit.
I'd like to see some scientific proof,

2276
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:17,430
but hey man,
with all the hippy shit,

2277
01:28:17,431 --> 01:28:19,110
there's not a lot of scientific proof
with it.

2278
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:19,801
No,
no,

2279
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:23,370
there's not a sense of knowing.
That's what it comes down to is a sense

2280
01:28:23,371 --> 01:28:26,850
of knowing like,
do you really feel like this is making

2281
01:28:26,851 --> 01:28:28,890
sense to you?
Does it register?

2282
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,350
And you're like,
I don't know why I believe this,

2283
01:28:31,351 --> 01:28:32,940
but I just do.
I don't even know where it came from.

2284
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:35,040
Yeah.
I don't know about that.

2285
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,930
Yeah.
I'd rather trust scientists.

2286
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:40,320
I like science too.
My sister and I went and saw Neil

2287
01:28:40,321 --> 01:28:45,310
degrasse Tyson and Indianapolis over the
winter when it was called the radio

2288
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:46,210
thing.
It was called the,

2289
01:28:46,211 --> 01:28:49,170
uh,
an astrophysicist reads the newspaper.

2290
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:52,390
Oh yeah.
So he like pulled Cray,

2291
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:53,940
you know,
articles and you know,

2292
01:28:53,941 --> 01:28:56,190
just laughed about them basically.
That's cool.

2293
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:00,270
Pluto came up because he was part of the
people part of the group that sort of

2294
01:29:00,271 --> 01:29:02,310
said the Pluto wasn't planet.
Yes.

2295
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,780
Yeah.
People get very upset with him.

2296
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:06,510
Yeah.
He also loved to point out how there'd

2297
01:29:06,511 --> 01:29:09,480
be something crazy and he'd be like,
let me point out,

2298
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:13,830
this is in the science section of the
newspaper.

2299
01:29:13,831 --> 01:29:17,310
Like as if like how did this make it to
the science section?

2300
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:21,660
Right?
He's going to come on here sometime in

2301
01:29:21,661 --> 01:29:26,310
February and they're going to,
he's going to talk to a guy who believes

2302
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:27,750
the earth is flat.
Oh,

2303
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:29,280
that guy,
he made fun of that guy too.

2304
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:32,080
He's like,
let me show you are a reflection of what

2305
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:34,090
it looks like if the earth was flat,
you know?

2306
01:29:34,091 --> 01:29:34,871
Of course it's,
you know,

2307
01:29:34,871 --> 01:29:36,310
shadow of a flat line.
It's like,

2308
01:29:36,311 --> 01:29:37,210
of course that's not true.

2309
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:40,360
Well of course it's not true,
but there's a lot of young people out

2310
01:29:40,361 --> 01:29:42,220
there today that believe the earth is
flat.

2311
01:29:42,250 --> 01:29:44,320
Do you believe the earth is flat?
This is,

2312
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:46,370
most certainly do not,
but I think it's,

2313
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:47,530
I mean,
do they,

2314
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:51,380
do they not think we actually go into
outer space and they think that that's

2315
01:29:51,381 --> 01:29:53,600
fake too,
but I think it's just a matter of,

2316
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:54,530
I think we landed on the moon.

2317
01:29:55,180 --> 01:30:00,180
If there's anything that I think is one
of the more attractive conspiracy

2318
01:30:01,421 --> 01:30:03,910
theories,
it's the moon landing was because the

2319
01:30:03,911 --> 01:30:08,530
only time they did it was between 1969
in 1972 they did seven missions,

2320
01:30:08,531 --> 01:30:12,700
six were successful and that's the only
time in human history that people have

2321
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:17,701
been more than I think 400 miles above
the earth's surface.

2322
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:23,140
Everything else,
all the space shuttle missions,

2323
01:30:23,170 --> 01:30:27,610
all of the space station missions,
all that stuff is inside of 400 miles.

2324
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:33,120
The moon is like 260,000 miles there and
back and they've never even sent a

2325
01:30:33,701 --> 01:30:36,040
chicken in the space and had it come
back alive.

2326
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:40,240
They never sent anything in this space
other than people like into deep space

2327
01:30:40,780 --> 01:30:42,820
passed the van,
Allen Radiation Belt packs,

2328
01:30:42,821 --> 01:30:45,700
the MAG needles fear.
I think most likely we went,

2329
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:50,590
but if there's ever a conspiracy theory
that's attractive to me it's that one

2330
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:54,280
cause I just think it would be
fascinating if during the Nixon

2331
01:30:54,281 --> 01:30:58,040
administration they really did fake it
and there's,

2332
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:01,050
there's a lot of weirdness to it.
They fake it.

2333
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:04,380
Well,
first of all to show military

2334
01:31:04,381 --> 01:31:06,000
superiority to the Russians.
And again,

2335
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:08,100
I'm not saying,
and I used to believe they did fake it.

2336
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:10,410
I was,
I was heavily on the side that they

2337
01:31:10,411 --> 01:31:12,030
faked it,
but then I realized,

2338
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:15,930
I don't know Jack Shit about
astrophysics.

2339
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:18,630
I don't know Jack Shit about rocket
travel.

2340
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:20,130
I don't,
I mean I'm just talking out of my ass.

2341
01:31:20,131 --> 01:31:25,131
So like me saying that they didn't go
was literally an ignorant perspective.

2342
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:29,580
Like well it's just being attracted to
conspiracy theories,

2343
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:33,360
which is fun.
That's the problem is that conspiracy

2344
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:36,070
theories are really fun.
Like big foot.

2345
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:38,010
It's really fun.
You have photos are really fun.

2346
01:31:38,011 --> 01:31:38,844
All that stuff

2347
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:42,680
of stuff to get to the get to the core
because there's,

2348
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:44,330
there's,
there's arguments on both sides.

2349
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,180
There is,
but it's also you have to recognize in

2350
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:50,360
yourself that you do not want the
official story to be true.

2351
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:54,800
And I do not an almost every single
thing that happens like,

2352
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:57,380
you know,
Moon landing or do Ufo landings.

2353
01:31:57,381 --> 01:31:58,460
Right.
Any crazy shit.

2354
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:03,610
I want the crazy shit to be real.
I always want the UFO thing to be a real

2355
01:32:04,031 --> 01:32:04,990
thing.
They do have it.

2356
01:32:04,991 --> 01:32:07,090
It's believe in aliens.
Yes.

2357
01:32:07,510 --> 01:32:10,980
I think it's more than likely that
there's something else.

2358
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:15,690
I feel like that we're the only thing in
the universe.

2359
01:32:15,691 --> 01:32:17,490
This is a little ridiculous.
It seems stupid.

2360
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:19,620
It seems pretty ignorant and arrogant.

2361
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:23,150
Yeah,
but I don't think that it's what we

2362
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:28,151
think it is.
I think it's a most likely far beyond

2363
01:32:28,191 --> 01:32:31,010
the,
the places that we can currently travel

2364
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:34,010
too,
and I think that by the time they get to

2365
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:39,040
a high level of sophistication,
they're most likely not even organic

2366
01:32:39,231 --> 01:32:41,300
anymore.
And I think that that's the future of

2367
01:32:41,301 --> 01:32:43,280
the human race.
I thought most of consciousness,

2368
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:44,870
well,
I think maybe that,

2369
01:32:44,871 --> 01:32:47,360
but I also think there's a real problem
with the possibility of artificial

2370
01:32:47,361 --> 01:32:51,740
intelligence.
I think human beings are about to create

2371
01:32:51,741 --> 01:32:54,470
life.
Whether we recognize it as life or not,

2372
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:56,960
what artificial life is going to be his
life.

2373
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:00,800
Artificial intelligence is going to have
the ability to change itself,

2374
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:06,250
multiply what human beings have been
able to do in terms of technological

2375
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:11,390
innovation by a rate of something
insane.

2376
01:33:11,391 --> 01:33:16,391
Like in two years they'll be able to do
10,000 years of innovation in terms of

2377
01:33:17,301 --> 01:33:20,720
like what we're capable of doing.
So I think that what we're looking at

2378
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:25,190
now is the,
the last days of biological life.

2379
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:28,370
I think a hundred years from now,
500 years from now,

2380
01:33:28,371 --> 01:33:31,850
whatever it is,
there won't be biological humans

2381
01:33:31,851 --> 01:33:33,260
anymore.
I think they'll,

2382
01:33:33,261 --> 01:33:35,250
this'll be an archaic out

2383
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,780
dainty will change as we know it.
Yeah.

2384
01:33:37,830 --> 01:33:38,780
And I can,
I mean,

2385
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:41,190
you know,
I don't believe in everything the Bible

2386
01:33:41,191 --> 01:33:42,330
says,
but you know,

2387
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,050
was that in the Bible?
Well,

2388
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,440
so the apocalypse and one of the changes
as we know it,

2389
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,780
I think the apocalypse slope world will
end as we know it,

2390
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:49,400
right?

2391
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:51,390
But I think the apocalypse,
like the stuff in the Bible,

2392
01:33:51,391 --> 01:33:53,190
that's all local.
Like if you,

2393
01:33:53,191 --> 01:33:55,740
if you lived where Hurricane Katrina
hit,

2394
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:57,120
you would think the apocalypse was
there,

2395
01:33:57,330 --> 01:34:00,090
right?
If you were in,

2396
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:02,370
you know,
anywhere where something really fucking

2397
01:34:02,371 --> 01:34:05,430
crazy happened and you didn't have any
contact with the outside world.

2398
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:06,750
No cell phones,
no radio,

2399
01:34:06,751 --> 01:34:08,210
no TV didn't exist.
Sure.

2400
01:34:08,570 --> 01:34:09,800
True.
You would isolate it.

2401
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:11,390
Yeah.
I think that's what all of our,

2402
01:34:11,391 --> 01:34:15,870
our notions of the apocalypse are there
periodic natural disasters that are

2403
01:34:15,871 --> 01:34:19,980
unbelievably devastating.
Like they've proven that the entire

2404
01:34:19,981 --> 01:34:24,390
human race was,
was down to a few thousand people

2405
01:34:24,510 --> 01:34:27,420
because of a supervolcano around 70,000
years ago.

2406
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:32,280
So I think there's been a series of
those events throughout history where

2407
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:34,530
the human race is brought down to an,
uh,

2408
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:37,950
an almost unmanageable level and then we
repopulate it.

2409
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:40,470
Huh.
And I think that that's probably the

2410
01:34:40,471 --> 01:34:43,680
origins of the apocalypse or asteroidal
impacts,

2411
01:34:43,681 --> 01:34:46,450
which are very common.
They've happened all throughout history.

2412
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:50,510
Ai is going to just eliminate biological
humans.

2413
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:53,190
I think it's entirely possible that
we're going to give into it too.

2414
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,710
Then we're going to take it,
we're going to first of all become

2415
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:58,640
symbiotic.
We're going to take something and put it

2416
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:01,400
inside of us.
It's going to enhance us was it's our

2417
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:04,190
ability to communicate,
whether it's our ability to see,

2418
01:35:04,610 --> 01:35:08,930
we're going to start implanting chips
into ourselves and then they're going to

2419
01:35:08,931 --> 01:35:11,720
have improved body parts.
Like say if you break your arm and

2420
01:35:11,721 --> 01:35:12,710
they're like,
look Danica,

2421
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:15,740
we can fix your arm,
but it's going to take a year.

2422
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:16,671
You have,
you know,

2423
01:35:16,671 --> 01:35:21,671
17 broken bones or we can replace it
with an arm that works better and it'll

2424
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:25,640
feel just like a regular arm.
And I'm going to bring in Mike and Mike

2425
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:28,430
has a fake arm and he's going to show
you how it works and Mike's going to

2426
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,110
come in.
I'm so much happier with my arm.

2427
01:35:30,111 --> 01:35:30,820
Then I was in my face,

2428
01:35:30,820 --> 01:35:33,790
come up with my real arm,
then a new drug drug pushers.

2429
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:34,751
They're like,
no,

2430
01:35:34,751 --> 01:35:38,460
this lookout works and I'll,
it's a free vacation to um,

2431
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:39,940
if you do this,
uh,

2432
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:41,410
I,
I've watched some,

2433
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:46,470
I heard some youtube video of like,
it was someone who channels other,

2434
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,190
oh,
one of those hours,

2435
01:35:48,910 --> 01:35:50,550
I think it was channeling the Palladian
so,

2436
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:52,570
oh yeah.
For probably totally legit.

2437
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:54,820
Yeah.
And she talked about how it was talking

2438
01:35:54,821 --> 01:35:57,490
about how as a,
as a human race,

2439
01:35:57,491 --> 01:35:59,890
we have to be careful.
We don't alter ourselves too much

2440
01:35:59,891 --> 01:36:02,650
because then we won't exist as a human
race because we won't be able to

2441
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,100
procreate.
And that is what keeps our race alive.

2442
01:36:06,640 --> 01:36:08,140
That's probably true.
I mean,

2443
01:36:08,141 --> 01:36:09,430
if you think about where we're going to
go,

2444
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:11,550
but also doesn't it have to

2445
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,410
keep evolving?
I mean,

2446
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:15,270
if we've got back,
look,

2447
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,900
do you think like monkeys when they were
living in trees thrown shitty

2448
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:21,140
each other or different than that?
Now we gotta be chill.

2449
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:24,110
Otherwise we're going to stop being
monkeys who won't be able to throw shit

2450
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:27,830
at each other and Dodge Jaguars,
bananas all day.

2451
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:28,580
Yeah.
I mean,

2452
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,700
I think people are afraid of change and
I think the human race is afraid of

2453
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:33,790
change too.
But we're by no means perfect.

2454
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:35,450
Most people don't do things right.
They're all,

2455
01:36:35,451 --> 01:36:37,080
everyone's afraid of change,
right?

2456
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:38,420
Taking a chance,
right?

2457
01:36:38,421 --> 01:36:41,030
Having it be different.
Maybe it's worse.

2458
01:36:41,060 --> 01:36:41,811
Well,
Dick,

2459
01:36:41,811 --> 01:36:43,170
maybe it's better.
You know?

2460
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:44,720
Well,
that's like the hallmark of your whole

2461
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:46,210
life.
Look at your 100% I'm,

2462
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:48,950
I'm not afraid of change.
I'm not.

2463
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:50,390
Okay,
so you have to roll it arm.

2464
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:52,040
I have a moment.
I'll take the arm.

2465
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:53,720
I'll,
I have a moment of,

2466
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:55,340
um,
uh,

2467
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:56,990
you know,
it was fear of like,

2468
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:59,690
Oh shit.
And then there's the next moment is,

2469
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,070
well,
maybe it's better than I could ever

2470
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:02,750
expect.
What if they were imagined?

2471
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:05,700
They'll give you two options.
They give you one robot arm that you

2472
01:37:05,701 --> 01:37:08,310
never have to work out.
It will always be strong.

2473
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:12,330
You can get that one or you can get one
that you constantly have to work out.

2474
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:13,640
Oh,
I would,

2475
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:16,610
I'd probably take the robot.
But which,

2476
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,250
which robot arm would you take?
The one that you constantly have to work

2477
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:20,900
out.
What would you take the one that's just

2478
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:21,770
perfect?
Yeah,

2479
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:23,870
I'd probably take the perfect one.
Never have to exercise.

2480
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:26,780
Just Bam.
Just jacked all the time.

2481
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,760
If I wanted a,
I mean,

2482
01:37:28,761 --> 01:37:31,370
working out,
if I still needed to do that for like

2483
01:37:31,371 --> 01:37:31,791
the,
you know,

2484
01:37:31,791 --> 01:37:34,370
feel good endorphin hormone sort of,
you know,

2485
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:37,040
state,
then I would still do that right here by

2486
01:37:37,041 --> 01:37:38,130
your brain,
just,

2487
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:41,253
well,
yeah.

2488
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:45,170
And I would go do a lot more stuff like
walking around in nature.

2489
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:48,230
Hmm.
That's good answer because that's,

2490
01:37:48,231 --> 01:37:50,000
I mean,
I really find enjoyment out of that.

2491
01:37:50,001 --> 01:37:53,300
I mean to find enjoyment out of the
intensity level of things and the

2492
01:37:53,301 --> 01:37:55,710
confidence that I get or the,
you know,

2493
01:37:55,740 --> 01:38:00,740
being able to shift my mindset to this
sort of like all go all in,

2494
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:04,260
not no pain,
no gain.

2495
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:07,890
That's so cheesy,
but like I can endure and the confidence

2496
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:09,870
that comes from enduring and pushing
through.

2497
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,950
I enjoy that.
I enjoy that development of my mind and

2498
01:38:13,951 --> 01:38:16,200
my discipline and my confidence.
I do.

2499
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:20,100
Um,
but I'm probably just shifting more into

2500
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:21,390
enjoying,
you know,

2501
01:38:21,870 --> 01:38:23,310
things that are a little more peaceful
too.

2502
01:38:23,311 --> 01:38:26,000
So shifting more and to enjoy nature.
Yeah.

2503
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:27,990
Yeah.
But that would be the most fucked up

2504
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:29,520
thing.
It's like you didn't enjoy nature

2505
01:38:29,521 --> 01:38:31,770
anymore.
They started replacing body parts and

2506
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:33,630
they're like,
you didn't give a shit about the forest.

2507
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:35,040
Oh,
that would be sad.

2508
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,350
I'll be sad.
I wouldn't take that body part then

2509
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:39,540
probably wouldn't know until it's too
late.

2510
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:43,920
Until they replaced probably going to be
dead before all this is real.

2511
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:44,840
So that's what I think

2512
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,250
those aliens are.
When people see Aliens,

2513
01:38:47,251 --> 01:38:48,580
those gray aliens,
Gray.

2514
01:38:48,581 --> 01:38:51,180
See guys,
I think that's just what we're going to

2515
01:38:51,181 --> 01:38:53,130
become.
That's what I think.

2516
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:55,590
I've been thinking that a lot.
I think it's natural.

2517
01:38:55,591 --> 01:38:59,820
If you look at what a monkey is,
and then if we were at some point in

2518
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:01,650
time,
like some ancient hominid like

2519
01:39:01,651 --> 01:39:03,300
Australia,
pithy gas or whatever,

2520
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:06,540
Cro Magnon man,
and then we moved on to become homo

2521
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:08,190
sapiens,
the f.

2522
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:11,250
If we keep going in that direction,
this is what we're going to look like.

2523
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:12,480
We're gonna look like a little skinny
things.

2524
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:13,314
A big heads

2525
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:15,300
lollipops.
Yeah.

2526
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:18,420
That's what I looked like when I had my
helmet on and I'm in my race suit.

2527
01:39:18,421 --> 01:39:21,120
People are like alien.
That's a good point,

2528
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:23,760
right?
Because I have a regular helmet.

2529
01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:24,780
That's right.
Yeah.

2530
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,570
I didn't even think of that.
Could your helmet is like,

2531
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:31,290
that would be like a big guy wearing an
enormous helmet.

2532
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:32,370
Yeah.
Crazy.

2533
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,410
Yeah.
Do you have a strong neck?

2534
01:39:34,420 --> 01:39:35,880
Most must have a wicked now.
Can I do,

2535
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,460
do you do exercises with it?
I don't need to.

2536
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:40,650
You don't just carry on the helmet
around all the time.

2537
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:45,810
It's probably that and just looking up,
looking up to my nine foot target for

2538
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:47,670
wall balls and like,
oh my neck hurts.

2539
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:50,200
Yeah.
Nah,

2540
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:50,881
just,
you know,

2541
01:39:50,881 --> 01:39:52,530
you're not out of the car,
out of the car that long.

2542
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,370
It might hurt a little bit when I get
back in an indy car again because the g

2543
01:39:56,371 --> 01:39:57,180
forces are higher.

2544
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:59,400
But you also lean your head against the
headrest.

2545
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,200
Usually the only thing that would make
me hurt my,

2546
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:04,560
make my neck hurt a little bit as road
courses at the beginning of the road of

2547
01:40:04,561 --> 01:40:06,510
indycar season.
What does it line to test?

2548
01:40:06,511 --> 01:40:09,390
Because acceleration and deceleration,
there's nothing to hold you from like

2549
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:11,670
your neck going,
your head going forward.

2550
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:13,740
I mean there is,
but not to the level that you would

2551
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,180
drive that way.
Um,

2552
01:40:15,181 --> 01:40:18,000
there's just a device that is in case
you're in an accident,

2553
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:19,740
but it still moves.
So you know,

2554
01:40:19,830 --> 01:40:21,930
holding,
holding your neck forward and backwards

2555
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:25,950
is a lot more sore than side to side
just because you have a head rest so we

2556
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:26,430
can use it.
Yeah.

2557
01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:29,170
Get out of a long race.
Is your whole body tired?

2558
01:40:29,171 --> 01:40:29,520
Yeah.

2559
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:31,380
Yeah.
I mean in stock cars it's,

2560
01:40:31,381 --> 01:40:34,410
so,
it's really a lot about dehydration.

2561
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:35,910
Dehydration.
Yeah.

2562
01:40:35,911 --> 01:40:37,130
I'm in the car.
It's like 130,

2563
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:40,190
140 degrees in there now.
Do you have a tube or you started to,

2564
01:40:40,191 --> 01:40:42,660
I wonder from a to camelback that goes
through the front of my helmet,

2565
01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:44,720
a couple of blowers,
the back blower,

2566
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:47,400
a helmet blower,
things that are cooler air,

2567
01:40:47,401 --> 01:40:50,910
but I'm here to tell you it's still hard
to sell on there or did I imagine?

2568
01:40:50,911 --> 01:40:51,020
Yeah.

2569
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:54,070
I mean there's a fire in a gigantic iron
block

2570
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:55,090
in front of you.
Yeah.

2571
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,670
When the water and oil temperature is
300 degrees.

2572
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:58,980
Yeah.
Jesus,

2573
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:01,660
it sort of,
it's like a greenhouse in the car.

2574
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,810
It's right.
It runs right underneath you to do.

2575
01:41:04,811 --> 01:41:08,020
You think you're going to miss it?
That's a great question.

2576
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:09,520
I was talking about this just the other
day,

2577
01:41:09,521 --> 01:41:11,200
like,
am I going to miss the intensity?

2578
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:12,970
Am I going to miss certain?
I mean,

2579
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,490
I don't know if I'll,
I think I will miss some of it a little

2580
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:16,840
bit.
Every now and again I'm driving down the

2581
01:41:16,841 --> 01:41:17,760
road and I'm like,
oh,

2582
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,760
I'll probably miss it a little bit.
But um,

2583
01:41:21,150 --> 01:41:23,640
but uh,
yeah,

2584
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:26,250
again,
I'm a decisive person,

2585
01:41:26,251 --> 01:41:28,140
so I'm good.
I'm sure you're good.

2586
01:41:28,170 --> 01:41:30,120
I'm just wondering more if I'm going to
miss the,

2587
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:36,140
the intensity level of the job and the
highs being so high,

2588
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:39,360
but the lows being low,
I mean,

2589
01:41:39,361 --> 01:41:41,370
that's the,
that's how you get the highest right and

2590
01:41:41,371 --> 01:41:43,950
the duality of the,
of the environment.

2591
01:41:44,010 --> 01:41:46,140
Um,
I'm wondering if I'll miss some of that

2592
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:50,610
and if whatever I do on the side will be
enough.

2593
01:41:52,010 --> 01:41:54,290
What is the age that most people retire
from racing?

2594
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:59,030
I'm 35 I'm a slightly young,
I would say early forties.

2595
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:03,050
After a while they just,
their body just takes too much and

2596
01:42:03,051 --> 01:42:04,670
you're just exhausted.
I mean honestly,

2597
01:42:04,671 --> 01:42:06,020
like,
especially if it's Nascar,

2598
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:08,570
he was just exhausted.
I mean it's,

2599
01:42:08,750 --> 01:42:10,400
I mean that's my feeling anyway.
You know,

2600
01:42:10,401 --> 01:42:13,640
you're gone for 40 weeks,
a year on the road and these,

2601
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:16,370
you know,
really luxurious places of the world on

2602
01:42:16,371 --> 01:42:19,430
the barbecue world tour,
like grilling out of your bus and living

2603
01:42:19,431 --> 01:42:21,980
out of a bus for most of your life and
you know,

2604
01:42:21,981 --> 01:42:26,981
on the road in and out of airplanes,
hours of nothing to do on the weekends

2605
01:42:27,351 --> 01:42:28,580
while you're,
you know,

2606
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:31,640
sitting there.
So just kind of the grind.

2607
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:34,460
So I think he kind of just get a little
worn out.

2608
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,070
I could only imagine,
you know,

2609
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:40,040
I mean even like you were talking about
interviews and stuff like yeah,

2610
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:45,041
I enjoy doing interviews that aren't
based around how's your car this

2611
01:42:45,110 --> 01:42:45,441
weekend?
You know what I mean?

2612
01:42:45,441 --> 01:42:47,280
There's just so boring.
They really weren't.

2613
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:52,040
So it's fun for me to talk about working
out or cooking or wine,

2614
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:52,581
food,
you know,

2615
01:42:52,581 --> 01:42:54,230
all that stuff.
It's just interesting.

2616
01:42:54,231 --> 01:42:59,231
Or aliens.
I can only imagine the boring grind of

2617
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,410
the media tour that you must have to go
through when you're racing all the time.

2618
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,850
Do you what Diana?
Good.

2619
01:43:05,851 --> 01:43:08,120
You are moving quite fast out there
today.

2620
01:43:08,121 --> 01:43:11,570
You have over performer.
I was watching the uh,

2621
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,850
the uh,
the old south park episode.

2622
01:43:13,851 --> 01:43:16,820
They had a bunch of Nascar drivers on
South Park and you know,

2623
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:19,130
it was the,
it was when um,

2624
01:43:19,770 --> 01:43:24,770
cartman's trying to be poor and stupid
so he could race in Nascar and he was

2625
01:43:24,951 --> 01:43:29,951
sponsored by badges cell and he
ate a ton of ad is still to make them as

2626
01:43:30,951 --> 01:43:33,710
stupid as he could and you realize that
the more stupid he got,

2627
01:43:33,711 --> 01:43:35,610
the more money spent in more in daddy
got.

2628
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:39,260
And that's how you got poor.
They're just bought like jet skis and

2629
01:43:42,110 --> 01:43:44,330
I think he says at one point in time,
Danica,

2630
01:43:44,331 --> 01:43:47,180
you're not having both halves porn
stupid as I am.

2631
01:43:47,510 --> 01:43:48,770
Oh that's right.
You were in it.

2632
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:49,633
Yeah,
I was in it.

2633
01:43:50,090 --> 01:43:51,770
Did you use your own?
No.

2634
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:52,170
Nice.

2635
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:55,980
Somebody else does all their own stuff.
I was on the simpsons that year too,

2636
01:43:56,020 --> 01:43:58,460
and I did my voiceover for that.
But for,

2637
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:01,190
for South Park now.
Did you love it?

2638
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,630
I was awesome.
I mean,

2639
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:04,610
I don't care what they say.
If you're on a show,

2640
01:44:04,611 --> 01:44:05,780
it's flattering.
Right.

2641
01:44:05,781 --> 01:44:09,680
They to make,
to make tv in a different capacity means

2642
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:10,770
you're being noticed.
Well,

2643
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:12,500
especially South Park.
Yeah.

2644
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,290
I think that's the funniest show that's
ever existed.

2645
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,390
Yeah.
Especially like all time.

2646
01:44:17,391 --> 01:44:18,070
If you look at the,
uh,

2647
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:20,240
all the episodes they've done,
I mean,

2648
01:44:20,241 --> 01:44:22,310
it doesn't even make sense how creative
they are.

2649
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:27,370
That's what I was thinking is how
they're just insightful ahead of things

2650
01:44:27,501 --> 01:44:31,010
a lot and definitely clever.
Like with there,

2651
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:33,010
the delivery of it.
Yeah.

2652
01:44:33,050 --> 01:44:34,440
They're wizards.
Yeah.

2653
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,690
Completely bizarre.
What kind of car do you drive in regular

2654
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:40,100
life?
Please don't say like a Prius.

2655
01:44:40,570 --> 01:44:41,403
No.
Throw it.

2656
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:42,471
Like if you're like,
oh,

2657
01:44:42,471 --> 01:44:44,390
I just drive.
The other day I was throwing some things

2658
01:44:44,391 --> 01:44:46,850
into the recycling bin and I'm like,
I'm just trying to do my part because

2659
01:44:46,851 --> 01:44:48,470
let's face it,
I burned fuel for a living.

2660
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,473
Yeah.
Right.

2661
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:53,660
In terms of how much fossil fuel,
I wonder if you could see a chart,

2662
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,120
how much fossil fuel the average person
burns.

2663
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:59,820
I would not be doing well on that.
That would not be a,

2664
01:44:59,821 --> 01:45:04,821
I would not do well with the
tree huggers are vegans of the world.

2665
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:10,580
All the people loving animals like me,
I'm all those people.

2666
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:14,030
I love the forest.
I try and eat vegetables most of the

2667
01:45:14,031 --> 01:45:15,170
time,
things like that.

2668
01:45:15,171 --> 01:45:17,750
But yeah,
I also don't do my part when it comes to

2669
01:45:17,751 --> 01:45:19,280
my job.
What kind of car do you drive?

2670
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:22,990
Uh,
so I've had cars for years through um,

2671
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:24,800
through the manufacturer.

2672
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:25,670
So,
um,

2673
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,590
this past year we were sponsored by
Ford.

2674
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:30,110
So I had,
I had a ford expedition,

2675
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:33,770
e l I didn't know what each element it
means extra long.

2676
01:45:34,060 --> 01:45:36,500
Oh,
I had extra space in the back.

2677
01:45:36,620 --> 01:45:37,850
Yeah,
it was,

2678
01:45:38,180 --> 01:45:39,920
yeah,
they hook you up with a Mustang,

2679
01:45:39,921 --> 01:45:41,030
shelby.
Well,

2680
01:45:41,031 --> 01:45:43,240
that's not very practical.
Three fifties.

2681
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,760
We weren't even allowed to customize
the,

2682
01:45:45,860 --> 01:45:48,240
customize the wheels on that thing.
So yeah,

2683
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:50,430
it was bare,
bare bones because they,

2684
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:53,150
that was part of the contract.
What you're alive.

2685
01:45:53,151 --> 01:45:56,270
You get a car but you can't get anything
dressed up.

2686
01:45:56,280 --> 01:45:59,800
So
I could have had a raptor I guess,

2687
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:05,020
but like trucks aren't really me.
Whatever better than the l

2688
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:08,930
a yeah.
So,

2689
01:46:08,931 --> 01:46:11,600
and then I had a Tahoe and I drove for
Chevy before that.

2690
01:46:11,820 --> 01:46:13,460
I would think that you would want
something fast.

2691
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:15,380
Um,
so that I a,

2692
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:18,560
I bought my first car and that's the
last car I bought.

2693
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:23,120
Oh yeah.
A long time ago I bought a Mercedes ml

2694
01:46:23,121 --> 01:46:25,790
63 amg.
It was like a suv,

2695
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:28,400
souped up suv.
That was a long time ago.

2696
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,770
I was like 10 years ago.
Um,

2697
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:32,990
I uh,
I bought a range rover.

2698
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:38,000
So since then you've just been using
manufacturer cars from the sponsors

2699
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,640
because they're free dollars and they're
not,

2700
01:46:40,641 --> 01:46:42,260
you know,
whatever is free is free.

2701
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:44,750
Is that like a part of the contract?
Like this the only car you're allowed to

2702
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:47,000
drive?
Um,

2703
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:47,863
probably not,
but,

2704
01:46:49,010 --> 01:46:50,670
but that was the only car you drove to
the race track?

2705
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:52,930
Probably the one driving your,
yeah,

2706
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:53,910
company car.
Yeah.

2707
01:46:53,911 --> 01:46:55,190
I'll probably good move.
Yeah.

2708
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,940
Yeah.
But other drivers have other cars too.

2709
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:00,210
But do you think that once you retire
you will start,

2710
01:47:00,211 --> 01:47:02,610
let go and god down,
whatever need to get something from

2711
01:47:02,890 --> 01:47:04,140
cargill?
What?

2712
01:47:04,230 --> 01:47:05,120
Nope,
not a cargo.

2713
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:06,780
I'm sorry to disappoint you mean how'd
you,

2714
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:10,480
how'd you even say those words?
I know carb.

2715
01:47:10,890 --> 01:47:13,330
Do you know who you are?
And I'm not going to Patrick.

2716
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:15,690
I know.
Race car driver,

2717
01:47:15,691 --> 01:47:17,580
woman.
I don't even know how many cylinders are

2718
01:47:17,581 --> 01:47:18,391
in things.
I'm just,

2719
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:19,860
I just drive him.
I'm just good at that.

2720
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:22,350
You don't know how many cylinders?
I don't know.

2721
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:23,520
I think we have eight.

2722
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:28,100
That's so crazy.
I just lost the sound.

2723
01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:30,300
Too many fans.
How could he be such a good driver and

2724
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:32,340
not know anything about cars?
I don't need to.

2725
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:36,030
That's a good way of looking at it.
I don't build it straight and have to go

2726
01:47:36,031 --> 01:47:38,700
to school for engineering.
I remember the beginning of our top 10

2727
01:47:38,701 --> 01:47:39,780
years old,
10 years old.

2728
01:47:39,781 --> 01:47:41,160
I remember.
So,

2729
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:41,731
uh,
yeah.

2730
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:44,040
I just,
I can drive them.

2731
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:46,920
You need to get yourself on those new
shelby gt.

2732
01:47:46,921 --> 01:47:49,740
500 700 horsepower.
I see.

2733
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,170
Oh,
I shelby.

2734
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:53,600
Oh,
okay.

2735
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:58,640
Not the GT.
Not The gt 500 or the PT cruiser to

2736
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:03,300
shelby just put out a new math problem
with those four gts.

2737
01:48:03,301 --> 01:48:04,740
They're awesome.
But the paddle shifts,

2738
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:07,380
you want a manual,
you want to stick?

2739
01:48:07,430 --> 01:48:08,280
Yeah.
Alex sticks.

2740
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,930
Yeah.
It's more fun.

2741
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:11,543
It is.
Yeah.

2742
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:13,740
Just some racy.
It's just more fun.

2743
01:48:14,110 --> 01:48:16,510
And I have a Bronco,
a 1977 bronco.

2744
01:48:16,510 --> 01:48:19,140
It's not down there driving that is,
you know,

2745
01:48:19,141 --> 01:48:20,080
to stick.
It's like,

2746
01:48:20,370 --> 01:48:21,990
it's not that fast,
but it's just,

2747
01:48:21,991 --> 01:48:24,120
it just feeds your testosterone,
mechanical,

2748
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:27,150
mechanical.
They feel it's analog.

2749
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:29,760
You know,
my car would be good off the line.

2750
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,880
I bought a Lamborghini along while back
and uh,

2751
01:48:32,881 --> 01:48:34,980
it didn't have a cup holder,
so I was like,

2752
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:37,770
well this is stupid.
This is not practical.

2753
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:41,460
So yeah.
So then I bought the Mercedes

2754
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:45,600
and that had a cup holder.
I had a couple of cup holders.

2755
01:48:45,601 --> 01:48:46,530
Yep.
So it was good,

2756
01:48:46,531 --> 01:48:47,580
but then it,
you know,

2757
01:48:47,610 --> 01:48:50,700
technology evolved and it didn't have
Bluetooth to play my music.

2758
01:48:50,701 --> 01:48:51,211
So I was like,
well,

2759
01:48:51,211 --> 01:48:53,940
I'm not going to have to get rid of
this.

2760
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:56,070
And that was when I started driving for
a chevy.

2761
01:48:56,071 --> 01:49:00,000
And then I got a Tahoe and I liked that.
And then I got a [inaudible].

2762
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:02,910
They didn't give you a corvette?
I didn't ask for one.

2763
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:07,900
How could you not want one driving
force?

2764
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:10,080
Certain practical car.
If I wanted a corvette,

2765
01:49:10,081 --> 01:49:11,050
I could buy one.
Oh,

2766
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:13,350
okay.
I know you're good.

2767
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:15,000
But I would say be like,
come on,

2768
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:17,130
hook it up.
I'm not,

2769
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:17,993
yeah,
I,

2770
01:49:18,790 --> 01:49:20,780
I'm not a car girl.
We went over this.

2771
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:22,050
Understand this though.
I keep,

2772
01:49:22,051 --> 01:49:24,210
I keep wanting to catch you in that lie.
No,

2773
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:25,710
I,
I don't care.

2774
01:49:25,711 --> 01:49:28,020
I just,
I have cars or like purses for me.

2775
01:49:28,021 --> 01:49:30,570
I just need one nice one and when it
wears out I'll get a new one.

2776
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,940
You don't like purses?
Not really.

2777
01:49:33,120 --> 01:49:35,190
Really cared girl.
Just needed one.

2778
01:49:35,191 --> 01:49:36,280
That looks good.
And

2779
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,960
what about shoes?
I like shoes.

2780
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,510
I have a lot of shoes.
Yeah,

2781
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:45,180
a girl.
I'm definitely a girl,

2782
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:48,220
but not purses.
A curl

2783
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,420
my own hair today.
Wow,

2784
01:49:49,421 --> 01:49:50,830
that's crazy.
How do you do makeup?

2785
01:49:50,831 --> 01:49:51,710
Yeah.
Okay.

2786
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:55,720
My shoulder hurts.
Hairspray.

2787
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,210
What does this stuff now I'm very much a
girl.

2788
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:01,540
I believe you.
That's what if people ask me what it,

2789
01:50:01,550 --> 01:50:04,190
what is it about you that people would
be surprised?

2790
01:50:04,191 --> 01:50:07,100
And I'm telling them like much more
girly away from the track than you'd

2791
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:10,370
think because I'm really aggressive at
the track and I don't look very happy

2792
01:50:10,371 --> 01:50:14,990
and away from the track I'm,
I try and be funny and I smile more and

2793
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:16,490
I'm much more relaxed.

2794
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:19,420
Are you surprised that with all your
success,

2795
01:50:19,490 --> 01:50:24,490
success and all the attention that
you've gotten from your success as the

2796
01:50:24,531 --> 01:50:28,070
only woman on your level in,
in professional racing,

2797
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:30,470
are you surprised that more women aren't
entering in,

2798
01:50:30,471 --> 01:50:33,710
that you haven't sort of opened the door
or do you think that it's such a

2799
01:50:33,711 --> 01:50:38,711
specialized and unique thing to do that
it's just not something that a lot of

2800
01:50:39,621 --> 01:50:40,700
women gravitate towards?

2801
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:44,360
I used to say that for a hundred men
that came through,

2802
01:50:44,361 --> 01:50:46,910
if you found a good,
he takes a hundred to find a good one

2803
01:50:47,300 --> 01:50:50,570
that comes pretty quickly.
But to go through a hundred women takes

2804
01:50:50,571 --> 01:50:53,330
a lot longer because there are so few of
them.

2805
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:55,190
Um,
there are more coming through,

2806
01:50:55,191 --> 01:50:56,330
but I just think that,
you know,

2807
01:50:56,331 --> 01:50:59,180
over time it just takes a lot longer to
find good ones.

2808
01:50:59,181 --> 01:51:00,560
But I don't know.
I don't know.

2809
01:51:00,570 --> 01:51:03,800
I'm,
I think back to a,

2810
01:51:03,801 --> 01:51:05,900
this is my ego talking.
I think back to,

2811
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:08,030
um,
a long time ago,

2812
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:09,560
um,
when,

2813
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:12,260
um,
Paul Newman was still alive and we were

2814
01:51:12,261 --> 01:51:14,060
on a late night show together,
probably Letterman,

2815
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:18,140
and he was asked before I went on,
he was the first guest if there was

2816
01:51:18,141 --> 01:51:20,720
going to be another driver,
another girl that comes through that

2817
01:51:20,721 --> 01:51:22,640
compares to me and he said he didn't
think so.

2818
01:51:24,460 --> 01:51:27,130
Maybe there won't be,
maybe there will be no shit.

2819
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:29,110
Yeah,
he knew his shit.

2820
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:30,340
Maybe.
I mean,

2821
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:33,400
you're unique.
I'm sure there will be someday.

2822
01:51:33,490 --> 01:51:36,550
I meet a lot of women like you because
of mma.

2823
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:39,670
Oh,
there's those savages that enter into

2824
01:51:39,671 --> 01:51:43,480
mma.
The women that fall wind up fighting in

2825
01:51:43,481 --> 01:51:45,220
MMA.
There's a lot of them.

2826
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,460
And I'm kind of stunned at how many of
them there are.

2827
01:51:48,790 --> 01:51:51,100
But I,
when I say they're like you,

2828
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:54,310
I mean they're bold,
powerful,

2829
01:51:54,311 --> 01:51:57,850
unique people that are,
does take wild chances.

2830
01:51:57,851 --> 01:52:00,660
I mean the type of person that is like a
holly home or someone like that.

2831
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:04,250
I think the big difference lies and
there are a lot of people that are

2832
01:52:04,251 --> 01:52:05,270
strong,
aggressive,

2833
01:52:05,271 --> 01:52:06,510
confident,
you know,

2834
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:08,150
assertive,
bold,

2835
01:52:08,210 --> 01:52:12,890
but to then be able to keep it together
and um,

2836
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:14,720
up,
up above their shoulders.

2837
01:52:15,290 --> 01:52:17,030
That's another,
that's the difference.

2838
01:52:17,900 --> 01:52:20,000
Keep it together in the pressure of a
race.

2839
01:52:20,150 --> 01:52:22,000
Yeah.
And the pressure of whatever moment is

2840
01:52:22,010 --> 01:52:25,550
have that you're having whatever
pressures are being put on you around an

2841
01:52:25,551 --> 01:52:27,410
event or for one.
I mean those are,

2842
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:30,800
that's really hard.
The right people around you being able

2843
01:52:30,801 --> 01:52:34,550
to filter the shit and let him like keep
the good,

2844
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,860
um,
s keep your own confidence up.

2845
01:52:36,980 --> 01:52:38,120
Um,
that's,

2846
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:41,240
that's hard.
That's the hardest part.

2847
01:52:41,270 --> 01:52:44,270
And then being able to flip that switch
when you're performing to,

2848
01:52:44,271 --> 01:52:47,350
of course then not have doubts,
but um,

2849
01:52:47,810 --> 01:52:48,830
more confidence.

2850
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:54,140
I think everything that you've said
would be mirrored by what a woman who

2851
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:56,600
competes at the very highest levels of
MMA would say.

2852
01:52:57,140 --> 01:53:00,980
I think they would find all those things
to be factors.

2853
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:01,851
You know,
it's just,

2854
01:53:01,851 --> 01:53:04,850
I'm,
I'm really stunned that you literally

2855
01:53:04,851 --> 01:53:06,320
are the only one.
I mean there's,

2856
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:08,990
that's a,
that's a incredibly rare position.

2857
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,330
Do you ever stop and think about like
what if you weren't there?

2858
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,900
It's not like it's forbidden for women.
Huh?

2859
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:18,250
I never thought about it like that.
I've moans mostly only thought about it

2860
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:23,110
from the perspective of like,
have I thought about what I've done in

2861
01:53:23,111 --> 01:53:26,650
the sport because it's stuff that people
haven't done before.

2862
01:53:26,651 --> 01:53:30,940
And usually my answer is,
is that someday we'll look back and,

2863
01:53:31,150 --> 01:53:32,740
you know,
be able to have a little bit more

2864
01:53:32,741 --> 01:53:34,930
perspective on it.
But right now I'm just kind of in the

2865
01:53:34,931 --> 01:53:35,700
middle of it.

2866
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:36,533
MMM.

2867
01:53:37,230 --> 01:53:38,670
But yeah,
I've never thought about it like that.

2868
01:53:38,671 --> 01:53:40,050
Like what if I was never there?

2869
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:41,240
Yeah.

2870
01:53:41,240 --> 01:53:41,691
Yeah.
I mean,

2871
01:53:41,691 --> 01:53:43,790
you're the only one.
So if you were never there,

2872
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,890
what it would,
it would just be constantly a boys' club

2873
01:53:47,891 --> 01:53:48,910
forever.
I mean,

2874
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:50,200
I,
I'm just,

2875
01:53:50,201 --> 01:53:52,570
I'm,
I'm really fascinated by complete

2876
01:53:52,571 --> 01:53:53,290
outliers.
I mean,

2877
01:53:53,290 --> 01:53:55,000
you're,
you're a complete outlier in that

2878
01:53:55,001 --> 01:53:56,350
regard.
I mean,

2879
01:53:56,351 --> 01:53:58,720
there's not like 30 girls,
oh,

2880
01:53:58,721 --> 01:54:00,760
there's 500 men,
but there's 30 girls.

2881
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:03,250
Know How many men are Nascar drivers?

2882
01:54:03,460 --> 01:54:04,660
Uh,
well the field is 40.

2883
01:54:04,990 --> 01:54:06,710
Yeah.
So 40 men,

2884
01:54:06,711 --> 01:54:09,020
one check.
That's crazy.

2885
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:11,750
And then there's a bunch of people that
are trying to do it.

2886
01:54:12,830 --> 01:54:14,330
Are there any women that are trying,

2887
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:15,880
again,
a lower formula is other,

2888
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:19,560
some that do some part time stuff.
And I'm trying to think of someone has

2889
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:23,460
done like a full season.
I don't know,

2890
01:54:24,690 --> 01:54:28,440
back in indy car there was some girls
who did more.

2891
01:54:28,690 --> 01:54:30,570
There were like at one,
one indy 500,

2892
01:54:30,571 --> 01:54:34,050
there was like five of us.
But most of the time there's none

2893
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:36,960
or one,
um,

2894
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,810
comes in waves.

2895
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:41,420
Do you stop?
I mean,

2896
01:54:41,421 --> 01:54:44,690
do you think that when you stop and you
look back on your career,

2897
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:49,691
you'll take into account and maybe have
a more objective sense of what an impact

2898
01:54:51,741 --> 01:54:53,450
that you've had?
Sure,

2899
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:55,350
yeah,
of course.

2900
01:54:55,351 --> 01:55:00,351
But I need distance right from it.
I need to gain perspective that way.

2901
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:03,060
Does that make sense?
It does.

2902
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,650
Yeah.
I'm sure in your career too,

2903
01:55:04,651 --> 01:55:07,920
like I mean to be able to identify the
things that you've done,

2904
01:55:07,921 --> 01:55:11,460
the influence you've had over people
with the conversations you've had with

2905
01:55:11,461 --> 01:55:13,590
the,
with the things in business you've done.

2906
01:55:13,591 --> 01:55:15,810
I mean,
it's hard to see when you're in the

2907
01:55:15,811 --> 01:55:17,800
middle of it.
Yeah.

2908
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:20,310
I don't look at that.
You don't want to look at that?

2909
01:55:20,430 --> 01:55:21,263
No,
no.

2910
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,190
Cause I don't want to get distracted.
Yeah.

2911
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:26,510
That's why people don't in the mall.
Cause it doesn't matter.

2912
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:27,240
Yeah.
But I'm,

2913
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:30,700
when I'm doing a lot of people are doing
what you're doing is very,

2914
01:55:30,701 --> 01:55:34,080
uh,
it's just tag it to be a woman that does

2915
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:38,160
the thing that many men think is
probably one of the most manly things

2916
01:55:38,161 --> 01:55:40,860
you could do other than fighting and
maybe football.

2917
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,150
Yeah.
It's like race,

2918
01:55:42,151 --> 01:55:43,690
car driver.
Like a little boy.

2919
01:55:43,691 --> 01:55:44,010
What do you want

2920
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,830
to be when you grow up?
Billy army or a race car driver.

2921
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,890
But that's just lightening McQueen.
I mean,

2922
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:52,620
yeah.
I mean it's like a natural thing for men

2923
01:55:52,621 --> 01:55:53,150
to gravitate.
Yeah.

2924
01:55:53,150 --> 01:55:55,040
Towards it.
Dad always said he was just like,

2925
01:55:55,041 --> 01:55:57,890
Gosh,
I had cursed with three girls in the

2926
01:55:57,891 --> 01:55:59,810
house,
goes my mom and then me and my sister

2927
01:55:59,811 --> 01:56:00,820
and I'm like,
Hm Dad,

2928
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:02,970
what more did you want?
Like what more did you want with it?

2929
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:05,630
If you had a boy as a son,
like what was he going to do that's

2930
01:56:05,631 --> 01:56:07,560
right.
Cooler than what I'm doing.

2931
01:56:08,150 --> 01:56:10,700
He'd be out there banging chicks.
That's what he's missing.

2932
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:14,210
You think my dad would think that was

2933
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:17,450
cool
if his son was banging chicks?

2934
01:56:17,990 --> 01:56:19,760
I would think probably that's my boy.

2935
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,830
Scared shitless for me.
Yeah,

2936
01:56:25,831 --> 01:56:28,110
that's gotta be,
I think still in my adult life.

2937
01:56:28,111 --> 01:56:29,060
It's like er,

2938
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:32,140
wealthy.
They had the courage to let you go to

2939
01:56:32,141 --> 01:56:36,880
England by herself when you were 16 I
mean that and race over there on another

2940
01:56:36,881 --> 01:56:39,760
continent all the way across an ocean
sort of.

2941
01:56:39,761 --> 01:56:42,400
You did get hurt to get to you.
We'll take forever.

2942
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:45,260
Yeah.
Bold.

2943
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:47,210
What is the worst crash you've ever been
in?

2944
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:51,470
A my first crash in indy cars.
My very first race.

2945
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,510
Whoa.
Kind of paralleled getting an a go kart

2946
01:56:53,511 --> 01:56:54,830
for the first time.
Having a big crash,

2947
01:56:54,831 --> 01:56:55,641
but yeah,
it was,

2948
01:56:55,641 --> 01:56:56,421
um,
homestead,

2949
01:56:56,421 --> 01:57:00,290
Miami and uh,
there was a big accident and I was

2950
01:57:00,620 --> 01:57:04,130
running low and someone was sliding down
the track that had damage and they

2951
01:57:04,131 --> 01:57:08,990
clipped my right rear and shot me up
into the wall head first and um,

2952
01:57:09,530 --> 01:57:12,530
slid down the track.
And I don't remember that part.

2953
01:57:12,531 --> 01:57:15,050
I don't remember getting out.
I don't remember walking to the

2954
01:57:15,051 --> 01:57:16,610
ambulance,
but there's footage of all of it.

2955
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:19,700
And I walked the wrong way away from the
ambulance.

2956
01:57:19,701 --> 01:57:22,850
I was walking the opposite direction and
then I was kind of like stumbling

2957
01:57:22,851 --> 01:57:26,150
around.
And then I got back to the back to the,

2958
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:26,980
um,
uh,

2959
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:30,290
medical truck and then I got in and
apparently I was very repetitive on the

2960
01:57:30,291 --> 01:57:32,810
way to the hospital and I kept asking
them,

2961
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:36,500
did it look bad?
And they were like,

2962
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:38,780
you have asked us that a few times and
I'm like,

2963
01:57:39,290 --> 01:57:40,940
oh,
I'll just stop.

2964
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:41,810
Oh yeah,

2965
01:57:41,810 --> 01:57:43,430
yeah.
That's a severe concussion.

2966
01:57:43,431 --> 01:57:46,490
That's one of the things that happens is
the people ask the same questions over

2967
01:57:46,491 --> 01:57:47,270
and over again.

2968
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:48,710
Hmm.
Well then I've had one,

2969
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:51,500
let's hope I don't have a cte.
I'm sure you probably do.

2970
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:53,720
I probably do a little bit.
Yeah,

2971
01:57:53,950 --> 01:57:55,730
just a little bit.
The devil touch Oh,

2972
01:57:55,810 --> 01:57:59,240
matter makes you more risky.
Does it does,

2973
01:57:59,260 --> 01:58:00,790
yeah.
That's crazy.

2974
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:02,380
That sort of thing.
One of the things it does,

2975
01:58:02,381 --> 01:58:03,580
it makes people more impulsive.

2976
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:07,060
Do UFC people get,
yeah,

2977
01:58:07,790 --> 01:58:09,460
100%.
Did you see that video?

2978
01:58:09,461 --> 01:58:11,430
Is there,
are they doing studies in UFC like they

2979
01:58:11,431 --> 01:58:16,200
did in the nfl with,
I'm doing tests after they've passed

2980
01:58:16,201 --> 01:58:20,310
away to know if like they had cte.
Isn't that what nfl had they,

2981
01:58:20,570 --> 01:58:22,800
I got,
there was a study that came out last

2982
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,290
year.
It was like almost all but one out of a

2983
01:58:25,290 --> 01:58:26,580
hundred and some had cte.

2984
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:27,461
Yeah,
it was,

2985
01:58:27,461 --> 01:58:28,930
um,
I forget the numbers,

2986
01:58:28,931 --> 01:58:30,730
but yeah,
there was only like one or two people

2987
01:58:30,731 --> 01:58:31,780
that didn't have it.
Right.

2988
01:58:31,781 --> 01:58:32,350
Yeah.
No,

2989
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:35,560
a hundred odd hasn't done that.
The UFC hasn't been around as long as

2990
01:58:35,561 --> 01:58:37,690
the NFL obviously.
So we,

2991
01:58:37,691 --> 01:58:40,240
um,
we're not dealing with the same data

2992
01:58:40,241 --> 01:58:42,040
pool,
but I'm sure when people

2993
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,110
do pass away,
we're going to find it.

2994
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:47,230
It's just varying levels.
I heard they actually have a test now

2995
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:48,300
for cte.
Oh,

2996
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:51,220
saffron,
the trauma surgeon that you're alive.

2997
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:55,330
Yeah.
What would you do if you had it?

2998
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:59,830
Making excuses.
I just go extra crazy.

2999
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,200
Well that's why I'm gambling.
Naked

3000
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:09,600
bottle of whiskey in each arm.
Chug,

3001
01:59:11,351 --> 01:59:12,280
Chug,
pals.

3002
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:15,220
So insightful.
This question,

3003
01:59:15,250 --> 01:59:19,720
did you see the video that just came out
from a couple of days ago from the guy

3004
01:59:19,721 --> 01:59:23,860
that hit the off ramp and went flying
through the air and landed in a house in

3005
01:59:23,861 --> 01:59:27,040
the second floor of a house?
His car's poking out the side,

3006
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:29,230
but I couldn't,
he couldn't do it again if he had to.

3007
01:59:29,231 --> 01:59:30,160
I'm sure.
No,

3008
01:59:30,161 --> 01:59:31,270
no,
it's just total random.

3009
01:59:31,271 --> 01:59:33,730
Crazy luck.
But it is hilarious.

3010
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:37,450
I mean,
and see if you,

3011
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:41,200
once you find it then go to crystal Lee
instagram.

3012
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:43,660
Cause Deleah had a hilarious meme that
he created,

3013
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:48,880
but this car hit this hit like a
barrier.

3014
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:52,960
Hit one of those cement barriers and
literally got launched into the air and

3015
01:59:52,961 --> 01:59:55,780
stuck into the second floor of a
building.

3016
01:59:56,740 --> 01:59:58,580
I don't know.
I don't know.

3017
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,800
What country does it merit?
Marico Marico two people escaped.

3018
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:06,010
The injuries are serious injuries.
How the fuck did,

3019
02:00:06,011 --> 02:00:08,140
I mean I wonder how they got out of the
car.

3020
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:10,780
I mean it's,
it's the way it's hanging out of the

3021
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:13,270
building.
Hopefully it's front wheel drive and

3022
02:00:13,271 --> 02:00:15,910
they could keep accelerating to get a
little further and so they can get out

3023
02:00:15,911 --> 02:00:17,990
of the car.
That's spoken like a true race cars,

3024
02:00:17,991 --> 02:00:19,630
right?
They get about it that way.

3025
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:21,010
Yeah.
Here it is.

3026
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:25,780
Here's the video footage so you could
see it and there's the car washes.

3027
02:00:26,470 --> 02:00:29,530
It hits the,
see this is that.

3028
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:32,860
It's hard to tell there,
but they literally went across traffic.

3029
02:00:32,861 --> 02:00:35,590
They're speeding.
You can see it again.

3030
02:00:36,220 --> 02:00:39,250
The guy goes across traffic,
flies in the air.

3031
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:40,570
Let's see.
Go to Christa.

3032
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:43,870
[inaudible] page is instagram page and
find the meme cause then you can see

3033
02:00:43,871 --> 02:00:45,580
that and what you,
let's get this guys.

3034
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:46,810
Oh that's crystal.
He is there.

3035
02:00:47,080 --> 02:00:48,190
He says,
come her.

3036
02:00:48,191 --> 02:00:49,900
Come over me.
I can't tonight.

3037
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:51,910
Her,
my parents were on the first floor and

3038
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:56,380
I'm on a second floor and I had been
coins me.

3039
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:02,620
I mean,
that fucking car is stuck inside that

3040
02:01:02,621 --> 02:01:03,700
building.
I mean,

3041
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:08,080
you wouldn't believe that that was real
if you didn't see it.

3042
02:01:08,081 --> 02:01:11,010
There
is that Nissan need,

3043
02:01:11,020 --> 02:01:13,710
that dentist office that he just parked
himself.

3044
02:01:14,730 --> 02:01:15,700
Yeah.
Here's the question.

3045
02:01:15,730 --> 02:01:18,610
What do you do if you're in the car?
Like it gets stuck there,

3046
02:01:18,850 --> 02:01:20,340
even climb out,
probably drunk.

3047
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:21,330
You gotta be drunk,
right?

3048
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:22,640
I mean,
there's nobody or something.

3049
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:25,120
So you just,
you open the door and you wait.

3050
02:01:25,300 --> 02:01:26,051
You,
uh,

3051
02:01:26,051 --> 02:01:30,460
you take on the sprained ankle and you
jump and Jesus went and then it lands on

3052
02:01:30,461 --> 02:01:33,520
your fucking head.
The thing falls out of the building

3053
02:01:34,100 --> 02:01:37,880
right thing here.
You call the cops who are honest to,

3054
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:40,340
okay,

3055
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,980
is there a big coins?
And then you go,

3056
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:43,430
oh my God,
that's funny.

3057
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:44,660
Who put up the video?
What is the,

3058
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:47,990
where's the video from some dude's name?
What is his name?

3059
02:01:47,991 --> 02:01:50,990
Kenny homes.
It's a k homes live.

3060
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:54,080
He's the guy who fo it.
He's from NBC La,

3061
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:55,460
I guess.
Minor injuries.

3062
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:56,570
Hmm.
That's crazy.

3063
02:01:56,571 --> 02:01:57,500
Oh,
Santa Ana.

3064
02:01:57,560 --> 02:01:59,310
Santa Ana.
People are out of their fucking mine.

3065
02:01:59,311 --> 02:02:01,940
That's where Eddie bravos from Santa Ana
people.

3066
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,890
Boom,
look at that car flying through the air.

3067
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:07,730
It's just the fact that it's stuck into
the building that's just so ridiculous.

3068
02:02:07,810 --> 02:02:10,860
It's probably for a movie now.
When you drive in regular life,

3069
02:02:10,861 --> 02:02:14,050
are you a lead foot?
I'm a very aggressive driver.

3070
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:15,370
I know it.
Yes I am.

3071
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:17,260
I'm,
I have a large comfort zone.

3072
02:02:17,261 --> 02:02:22,261
I say people piss me off a lot.
They are horrible drivers and I,

3073
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:23,890
um,
I'm,

3074
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:24,701
I'm very,
uh,

3075
02:02:24,701 --> 02:02:26,290
yeah.
The only way I can make sure that I

3076
02:02:26,291 --> 02:02:28,360
don't get a speeding ticket is to not
drive.

3077
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:30,550
How many speeding tickets have you
gotten?

3078
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:32,350
Oh,
I've been pulled over at least 20 times.

3079
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:38,370
I got pulled over three times in three
days at one point when I,

3080
02:02:38,710 --> 02:02:40,900
my Mustang Cobra,
my first ever car.

3081
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:42,940
Oh,
Jesus.

3082
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:44,560
You see?
That's why I'm surprised you don't have

3083
02:02:44,561 --> 02:02:45,880
a fast car.
Oh,

3084
02:02:45,930 --> 02:02:48,550
I always make sure it's a good car.
Like that fast car.

3085
02:02:48,551 --> 02:02:51,070
But I mean like today,
like right now,

3086
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:54,040
like when you're driving around,
pulling up.

3087
02:02:54,070 --> 02:02:54,611
No,
no,

3088
02:02:54,611 --> 02:02:55,031
no.
I mean,

3089
02:02:55,031 --> 02:02:56,410
your everyday life.
Yeah.

3090
02:02:56,411 --> 02:03:00,280
Well I'm driving rentals because I don't
live here.

3091
02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:01,780
I mean not,
I mean here,

3092
02:03:01,781 --> 02:03:03,400
I mean in real life.
Real life.

3093
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:04,840
Oh yeah.
Like where's my sports car?

3094
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:07,350
Yeah.
Well I,

3095
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:09,040
you know,
in 40 weeks a year I'd do that.

3096
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:12,430
So you just get people mover.
I got two dogs.

3097
02:03:12,460 --> 02:03:14,680
Right.
So you get enough of it.

3098
02:03:14,681 --> 02:03:16,750
All my bags,
I feel like I'm trying to sell you a

3099
02:03:16,751 --> 02:03:18,850
car.
What car should I buy?

3100
02:03:19,630 --> 02:03:23,050
I would say something Martin.
Something that you do like American made

3101
02:03:23,051 --> 02:03:23,560
cars?
Yeah,

3102
02:03:23,560 --> 02:03:26,140
I would say I tend to die.
I don't care if they are or aren't

3103
02:03:26,141 --> 02:03:27,910
really well,
I have a porsche.

3104
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,400
I liked that.
I like a German cars too.

3105
02:03:30,430 --> 02:03:33,160
They're more reliable.
What I like about American cars is I

3106
02:03:33,161 --> 02:03:35,980
like the sound.
I liked the way that I just is a rumble

3107
02:03:35,981 --> 02:03:37,730
throatiness to it.
Do it.

3108
02:03:38,500 --> 02:03:41,140
You like to like,
so you like to make noise on the road?

3109
02:03:41,340 --> 02:03:42,640
I'm,
I'm a loud person.

3110
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:46,630
Yeah.
I have a 65 corvette with straight

3111
02:03:46,631 --> 02:03:48,100
pipes.
Those still side pipes.

3112
02:03:48,101 --> 02:03:50,380
Yeah.
Super kind of know what that is.

3113
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:52,720
Yeah.
I can picture it kind of race car

3114
02:03:52,721 --> 02:03:54,280
driver,
but it's a state that's what's

3115
02:03:54,281 --> 02:03:56,020
important.
I

3116
02:03:57,760 --> 02:03:58,930
don't care.
Nope.

3117
02:03:59,010 --> 02:04:01,620
But I would feel like we're someone like
you,

3118
02:04:01,830 --> 02:04:04,980
once you transitioned away from racing,
then it's going to be more important to

3119
02:04:04,981 --> 02:04:07,770
you because you're going to like miss
the capabilities of those things

3120
02:04:07,790 --> 02:04:09,340
at might be true.
Yeah,

3121
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:10,860
that might be true.
I might have to,

3122
02:04:10,861 --> 02:04:12,410
uh,
oh,

3123
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:13,470
there's my car.
Oh,

3124
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:15,600
that was a good looking car and sweet
car.

3125
02:04:15,630 --> 02:04:17,310
Jay Leno of course.
Of course.

3126
02:04:17,311 --> 02:04:18,360
He loves cars.
Yeah.

3127
02:04:18,770 --> 02:04:21,510
I'm not an,
I also don't really like old cars,

3128
02:04:21,600 --> 02:04:22,380
so,
um,

3129
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:24,300
that looks pretty good.
It's pretty fancy looking.

3130
02:04:24,330 --> 02:04:26,010
But um,
yeah,

3131
02:04:26,011 --> 02:04:27,390
I'm,
I'm a new car person.

3132
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:30,180
I like new modern sports cars.

3133
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:34,010
I do as well.
But that car is a 65 on the outside,

3134
02:04:34,220 --> 02:04:36,350
but all the underpinnings are completely
modern.

3135
02:04:36,380 --> 02:04:41,250
It has a one supercharged engine,
so it does a modern corvette engine,

3136
02:04:41,251 --> 02:04:42,540
Scott,
modern brakes,

3137
02:04:42,870 --> 02:04:45,450
modern suspension.
You don't know what any of that stuff

3138
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:45,930
means,
dude.

3139
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:46,860
Nope.
That's cool.

3140
02:04:47,210 --> 02:04:49,140
I know that my very first car,
my Mustang Cobra,

3141
02:04:49,141 --> 02:04:52,260
I drove it so hard that I needed an
8,000 miles.

3142
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:57,261
I was on my third set of brakes.
We put stiffer sway bars in it so that

3143
02:04:59,881 --> 02:05:02,400
it would handle better.
Um,

3144
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:03,900
it was uh,
yeah,

3145
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:05,050
I went through three,
so yeah,

3146
02:05:05,051 --> 02:05:06,750
it was on my third set of brakes and
8,000 miles.

3147
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:09,320
And now you say Mustang Cobra.
Like what year was this?

3148
02:05:09,610 --> 02:05:10,510
Oh,
this is when I first,

3149
02:05:10,511 --> 02:05:12,400
this is my first ever car,
so I was 16.

3150
02:05:12,401 --> 02:05:15,610
So I think it was a um,
uh,

3151
02:05:15,910 --> 02:05:18,840
97.
It was,

3152
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:19,823
yeah,
it was,

3153
02:05:20,730 --> 02:05:23,580
I'm not saying they're not cool,
but it was back when they were more cool

3154
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:26,580
when you know they were a lot,
lot less common.

3155
02:05:27,320 --> 02:05:27,730
Okay.

3156
02:05:27,730 --> 02:05:29,860
Yeah,
they were okay back on the back end of

3157
02:05:29,861 --> 02:05:31,810
the Cobra cool days.
Yeah.

3158
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:33,910
No,
the 90 sevens were okay there.

3159
02:05:33,911 --> 02:05:36,520
All right.
Like it run the eighties is when uh,

3160
02:05:36,730 --> 02:05:40,690
they came out with the 5.0 and then,
then like mustangs had a little bit more

3161
02:05:40,691 --> 02:05:41,400
power again.

3162
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:44,640
So what's your dream car then?
That corvette.

3163
02:05:44,850 --> 02:05:45,940
That's my favorite car.
Oh,

3164
02:05:46,020 --> 02:05:46,853
now what?
Then?

3165
02:05:47,220 --> 02:05:48,420
No,
try that around.

3166
02:05:49,140 --> 02:05:50,610
Do you drive it much?
All the time.

3167
02:05:50,750 --> 02:05:51,540
Oh,
okay.

3168
02:05:51,540 --> 02:05:52,920
Well,
it doesn't really rain in California,

3169
02:05:52,921 --> 02:05:53,650
so I guess you can,

3170
02:05:53,650 --> 02:05:56,100
well it has a top.
You put the driving rains.

3171
02:05:56,140 --> 02:05:56,901
I have.
Oh,

3172
02:05:56,901 --> 02:05:58,690
good for you.
Good for you.

3173
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:00,070
It's just a car.
Yeah.

3174
02:06:00,310 --> 02:06:02,170
Oh me,
I'm not afraid of it getting wet.

3175
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:04,270
The only problem is it's slippery,
you know,

3176
02:06:04,271 --> 02:06:06,730
it doesn't have any control or any of
that.

3177
02:06:06,731 --> 02:06:10,060
It's just all engine power and Torque
and yeah,

3178
02:06:10,150 --> 02:06:10,940
that's fun.

3179
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:13,760
Yeah.
I remember driving a Camaro around in

3180
02:06:14,750 --> 02:06:16,730
the rain and it was handled like trap.

3181
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:18,470
Just get one of the new ones.
Camaro.

3182
02:06:18,471 --> 02:06:20,000
Zl One,
they have a new one,

3183
02:06:20,030 --> 02:06:23,060
650 horsepower.
It's fucking ridiculous.

3184
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:26,300
I mean,
nobody even barely uses the full speed

3185
02:06:26,301 --> 02:06:27,980
of that here.
I don't know.

3186
02:06:27,981 --> 02:06:28,530
What am I?
Oh,

3187
02:06:28,530 --> 02:06:30,170
so I was actually going to tell you
about this.

3188
02:06:30,171 --> 02:06:31,010
This is,
I did a,

3189
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:32,720
a road and track,
um,

3190
02:06:32,790 --> 02:06:36,020
cover article where I test drove,
um,

3191
02:06:36,140 --> 02:06:38,360
um,
it was a porsche,

3192
02:06:38,480 --> 02:06:40,850
a corvette.
Um,

3193
02:06:40,940 --> 02:06:44,240
Eh,
I think it was a viper of some sort,

3194
02:06:44,330 --> 02:06:45,890
a viper.
And then there was,

3195
02:06:45,891 --> 02:06:47,410
um,
um,

3196
02:06:47,680 --> 02:06:50,720
a,
a Lamborghini Mercia logo and I'll,

3197
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:52,280
I mean,
my experience was the,

3198
02:06:53,120 --> 02:06:55,880
the Porsche was loose,
which is this one.

3199
02:06:56,460 --> 02:06:59,630
The corvette was tight,
which meant it was the most comfortable

3200
02:06:59,631 --> 02:07:01,670
and stable to drive.
Um,

3201
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:02,840
the,
uh,

3202
02:07:02,990 --> 02:07:07,460
I think it was a viper.
The Viper was just light on its feet,

3203
02:07:07,480 --> 02:07:09,800
Kinda just didn't really,
it wasn't very stuck and it was just

3204
02:07:09,801 --> 02:07:11,270
kind of clunky.

3205
02:07:11,970 --> 02:07:13,830
It's about seven or eight years old,
is that right?

3206
02:07:13,940 --> 02:07:14,601
Oh,
at least.

3207
02:07:14,601 --> 02:07:15,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

3208
02:07:15,320 --> 02:07:15,931
And then,
uh,

3209
02:07:15,931 --> 02:07:16,640
the,
the,

3210
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:18,890
the Lamborghini was,
was also light.

3211
02:07:18,891 --> 02:07:22,190
I mean it just went so fast,
but it's pretty well balanced,

3212
02:07:22,191 --> 02:07:24,020
but probably a little on the loose side.
So,

3213
02:07:24,090 --> 02:07:25,500
you know,
they stopped making vipers.

3214
02:07:25,530 --> 02:07:29,490
But I know the car for you does it car
that's for sale right now that,

3215
02:07:29,491 --> 02:07:30,780
uh,
I saw this morning.

3216
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:31,240
No,
no,

3217
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:32,820
no.
I'm trying to sell you a car.

3218
02:07:32,821 --> 02:07:34,110
This whole,
no,

3219
02:07:34,140 --> 02:07:37,360
uh,
Giappo link had a rare,

3220
02:07:37,390 --> 02:07:40,140
one of the,
this one dealership in 2017.

3221
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:44,830
The country bought up like 90% of the
vipers and they ordered them in a bunch

3222
02:07:44,831 --> 02:07:48,790
of crazy paints games.
And they ordered this hot pink viper.

3223
02:07:48,820 --> 02:07:49,700
Shut up.
Yeah.

3224
02:07:49,740 --> 02:07:51,940
Me To drive a car.
You got to see it.

3225
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:54,400
I drive it.
It's so fucking bad ass.

3226
02:07:54,401 --> 02:07:55,630
I'd drive it.
I like that.

3227
02:07:55,650 --> 02:07:57,820
Cool.
Or if a due to drive a pink car and I

3228
02:07:57,821 --> 02:08:00,790
would drive like some like stainless
steel,

3229
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:02,690
silver,
you know,

3230
02:08:02,830 --> 02:08:05,530
I would drive it and then I'd get a
rainbow license plate.

3231
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:08,500
So people would just assume I'm gay.
There's no way around it.

3232
02:08:08,630 --> 02:08:11,110
I've got a rainbow plate.
You've got a pink car.

3233
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:15,610
Just let it out sound it.
Isn't that it's shit.

3234
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:18,670
It was a,
I'm by google news feed this morning.

3235
02:08:18,671 --> 02:08:19,510
I looked at that.
I was like,

3236
02:08:19,511 --> 02:08:21,520
if I was a church that,
that'd be my fucking car.

3237
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:26,790
But it's like crazy metallic hot pink
Viper Mary Kay car.

3238
02:08:28,270 --> 02:08:29,110
No,
that's not it.

3239
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:31,630
That's old.
That shit's old red.

3240
02:08:31,900 --> 02:08:32,733
Yeah,
that's red.

3241
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:38,280
It's a 2017.
It might not even be joppa link.

3242
02:08:39,041 --> 02:08:39,750
I might,
uh,

3243
02:08:39,750 --> 02:08:40,960
that,
that would think that was what I was

3244
02:08:40,961 --> 02:08:42,840
reading to drive it.
Okay.

3245
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:44,740
You don't have to pull it up.
That's good thought,

3246
02:08:44,741 --> 02:08:47,620
but rather have black.
Let me guess.

3247
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:49,290
Black.
Uh,

3248
02:08:49,710 --> 02:08:52,500
black tinted windows,
black,

3249
02:08:52,501 --> 02:08:53,334
black,
black,

3250
02:08:53,360 --> 02:08:54,740
black wheels,
black whoa.

3251
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:57,970
Darkness.
Like a darth vader type thing.

3252
02:08:59,020 --> 02:09:00,490
So bad ass.
More.

3253
02:09:00,491 --> 02:09:03,230
More masculine than feminine.
Yeah.

3254
02:09:04,220 --> 02:09:05,800
I'm trying to figure out what kind of,
oh,

3255
02:09:05,801 --> 02:09:06,310
there it is.

3256
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:08,920
That's not it.
But that's an old one too,

3257
02:09:09,910 --> 02:09:11,440
but it's all right.
No worries.

3258
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:13,930
Those crows,
someone looks gross.

3259
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:18,010
The other one didn't look so gross.
It's more of a darker pink.

3260
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:19,990
You don't have to find a chamber.
Forget it.

3261
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:22,270
She's easy.
She's going to hate it no matter what.

3262
02:09:22,480 --> 02:09:25,000
She wants Darth Vader,
pink corvettes that,

3263
02:09:25,001 --> 02:09:26,090
uh,
Angela Andrew,

3264
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:30,130
I saw her the other day.
I saw her driving that.

3265
02:09:30,131 --> 02:09:35,131
Do know who Angelina's Angelina is a
woman who when I moved to California in

3266
02:09:35,771 --> 02:09:38,740
the 90s,
she used to have these billboards all

3267
02:09:38,741 --> 02:09:40,450
around California.
Of what?

3268
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:41,670
It's her.
Oh,

3269
02:09:41,830 --> 02:09:44,670
her like in her bikini.
Uh,

3270
02:09:44,770 --> 02:09:48,790
like she would just say her.
It would just say her name and her phone

3271
02:09:48,791 --> 02:09:50,330
number and that's,
that's,

3272
02:09:50,360 --> 02:09:52,000
he knows those billboards.
Oh,

3273
02:09:52,001 --> 02:09:52,860
shoot.
Well,

3274
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,070
yeah,
that's her.

3275
02:09:54,640 --> 02:09:55,990
And so these,
and I'd be like,

3276
02:09:55,991 --> 02:09:57,670
what the fuck is Angelina?
And everybody would be like,

3277
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:59,530
aw,
she's like this local celebrity.

3278
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:03,850
And so she apparently is just a wealthy
lady who,

3279
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:07,360
uh,
all of her time here has done that.

3280
02:10:07,480 --> 02:10:10,480
Just got these big billboards.
Yeah.

3281
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:12,790
She's doing a split on top of a
corvette.

3282
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:16,650
Is that a good thing?
Um,

3283
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:21,670
for her,
maybe she kept doing it so she still

3284
02:10:21,671 --> 02:10:22,620
does it right.
There's,

3285
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:24,280
you still have a billboard?
Not a billboard,

3286
02:10:24,281 --> 02:10:26,410
but I just,
she has at least three different print

3287
02:10:26,411 --> 02:10:29,530
corvettes and all I've seen,
I've seen her really recently in the

3288
02:10:29,531 --> 02:10:31,570
pink corvette.
Yeah.

3289
02:10:32,580 --> 02:10:33,830
Not,
you definitely know.

3290
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:34,130
You

3291
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,330
know,
I'm more like,

3292
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:40,100
I'm more of your sub do actually,
when I got the Lamborghini and I had to

3293
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:43,730
go pick my sister up from the airport,
okay.

3294
02:10:43,731 --> 02:10:45,470
There's nowhere to put your,
put your bags.

3295
02:10:45,710 --> 02:10:47,780
It's a,
it's like a briefcase for,

3296
02:10:48,110 --> 02:10:48,980
for uh,
you know,

3297
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:53,300
trunk and it's in the front.
So that was kind of silly.

3298
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,700
Um,
and then I realized that people normally

3299
02:10:55,701 --> 02:10:58,490
get these cars so they can just like
kind of take it out to dinner.

3300
02:10:58,610 --> 02:11:00,830
I don't want to be looked at so I'm not
going to,

3301
02:11:00,831 --> 02:11:04,460
I'm more likely to take it to go get
groceries than I am to go to dinner.

3302
02:11:04,850 --> 02:11:06,980
So I realized it was pretty pointless
for me.

3303
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:09,530
Yeah.
That's not the car for you.

3304
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:11,570
And if I want performance,
I go do my job

3305
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:14,680
for now.
For now.

3306
02:11:14,890 --> 02:11:16,540
But when it's over,
that's what I'm trying to look.

3307
02:11:16,570 --> 02:11:17,920
I'm trying to keep trying to help me.
You're,

3308
02:11:17,921 --> 02:11:21,010
you're looking forward.
I'm looking forward after these next two

3309
02:11:21,011 --> 02:11:21,550
races.

3310
02:11:21,550 --> 02:11:23,170
Well,
have to visit again in a year,

3311
02:11:23,410 --> 02:11:25,230
a year from now and,
and um,

3312
02:11:25,850 --> 02:11:28,330
I have to figure this,
figure it all out.

3313
02:11:28,690 --> 02:11:29,920
I'll tell you.
You're right.

3314
02:11:29,921 --> 02:11:30,510
Probably,

3315
02:11:30,510 --> 02:11:34,360
well in a year from now then the new
corvette zr one will be available.

3316
02:11:34,420 --> 02:11:39,420
750 horsepower.
Stupid 62 seconds.

3317
02:11:40,230 --> 02:11:41,410
I mean,
if we're going to use it,

3318
02:11:41,411 --> 02:11:44,050
so you might use the zero 1650 speeding
tickets.

3319
02:11:44,051 --> 02:11:45,340
So he talking to you negative.
True.

3320
02:11:45,610 --> 02:11:46,443
That's true.

3321
02:11:47,750 --> 02:11:49,550
Nobody get,
nobody got a speeding ticket for getting

3322
02:11:49,551 --> 02:11:51,710
the speed limit to quickly though.
That's true.

3323
02:11:51,950 --> 02:11:53,570
Yeah.
Well they probably would pull you over

3324
02:11:53,571 --> 02:11:54,320
anyway.
Actually,

3325
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:57,110
I got a funny story about when I got
pulled over when I was 16 with my

3326
02:11:57,111 --> 02:11:59,930
Mustang Cobra.
I was picking my girlfriend up and

3327
02:11:59,931 --> 02:12:03,260
pulling out of her,
her off of her street onto the main

3328
02:12:03,261 --> 02:12:06,890
street and it was wet out.
And so I kind of got it going and kicked

3329
02:12:06,891 --> 02:12:10,070
it sideways a little bit and looked in
my rear view mirror at the stoplight.

3330
02:12:10,130 --> 02:12:13,550
And there's a cop sitting there.
Well he comes for me.

3331
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:16,010
So I turned on the first road I can
find.

3332
02:12:16,011 --> 02:12:20,360
So I make a left drive down the road,
it's a fricking dead end.

3333
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:25,330
So I pull into a driveway and we
slouched down real low and the COP Kinda

3334
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:27,740
drives around and all of a sudden
somebody comes out from the house,

3335
02:12:28,020 --> 02:12:29,010
can I help you?
And I'm like,

3336
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:30,540
ah,
what road is this out here?

3337
02:12:30,541 --> 02:12:31,141
I mean,
mind you,

3338
02:12:31,141 --> 02:12:32,610
it's the road I live off of.
I'm like,

3339
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:33,840
Oh,
what road is this out here?

3340
02:12:34,260 --> 02:12:35,640
So anyway,
so we're like,

3341
02:12:35,641 --> 02:12:36,540
oh good.
Okay,

3342
02:12:36,541 --> 02:12:37,271
thank you.
Sure.

3343
02:12:37,271 --> 02:12:38,060
And so we,

3344
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:39,780
yeah,
back in the car and the cops gone.

3345
02:12:39,781 --> 02:12:42,900
So we back out and head back down the
road again,

3346
02:12:43,590 --> 02:12:45,810
trying to get further away from the Stop
Light.

3347
02:12:45,811 --> 02:12:48,420
Make a left.
I look over in the parking lot across

3348
02:12:48,421 --> 02:12:51,740
the street,
the grade school parking lot cops

3349
02:12:51,741 --> 02:12:53,970
sitting there.
So I make the first right,

3350
02:12:53,971 --> 02:12:56,760
I can then,
so I turned right into a neighborhood

3351
02:12:56,761 --> 02:13:00,270
and I'm driving along and he finally
catches me and I think I cried.

3352
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:01,460
Helped me.

3353
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:04,340
Did he turn his lights on?
So you were running from him?

3354
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:07,970
Kind of [inaudible] this guy sounds like
a shitty driver,

3355
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:09,460
like a shitty cop,

3356
02:13:09,640 --> 02:13:11,980
but I think I got in trouble for being
sideways.

3357
02:13:11,981 --> 02:13:14,680
Not for speeding.
Yeah.

3358
02:13:14,681 --> 02:13:15,514
You should say

3359
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:18,390
so I friend's car.
I don't even know how to drive this

3360
02:13:18,391 --> 02:13:19,224
thing.

3361
02:13:19,950 --> 02:13:21,710
Ben.
Actually a clever at uh,

3362
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:23,010
approach.
Yeah,

3363
02:13:23,730 --> 02:13:24,271
yeah,
yeah.

3364
02:13:24,271 --> 02:13:26,040
Just say I had,
I don't know what happened.

3365
02:13:26,041 --> 02:13:28,680
I hit the gas and then one side,
where am I getting pulled over three

3366
02:13:28,681 --> 02:13:32,040
times in three days episodes.
So that was number three.

3367
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:34,950
I think I cried.
Maybe it was number two.

3368
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:36,540
So is that why you were running from the
cops?

3369
02:13:36,550 --> 02:13:37,320
Like,
I just can't,

3370
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:42,320
I can't keep doing this.
I just try and see if I could to just

3371
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,670
get away.
Well,

3372
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:46,920
Danica,
I think I've kept you long enough.

3373
02:13:47,370 --> 02:13:49,620
It was really wonderful to talk to you.
I really appreciate it.

3374
02:13:49,621 --> 02:13:52,320
It was really fun.
I wish you all the best of luck with

3375
02:13:52,321 --> 02:13:55,710
your wine and your clothes and you last
two races and,

3376
02:13:55,711 --> 02:13:56,940
uh,
it was a pleasure.

3377
02:13:57,150 --> 02:13:59,880
Thank you.
So nice to talk to teach about the whole

3378
02:13:59,881 --> 02:14:02,970
car situation next year and next year
you're going to want to get something

3379
02:14:02,971 --> 02:14:04,830
crazy.
I guarantee once you're done,

3380
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:06,720
when I tell you I'm,
I'm a,

3381
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:09,330
I'm missing the action.
I'll let you just call the car.

3382
02:14:09,331 --> 02:14:11,250
I should buy it.
Sounds like a plan.

3383
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:13,200
Danica Patrick,
ladies and gentlemen,

3384
02:14:16,860 --> 02:14:18,490
that was fun.
