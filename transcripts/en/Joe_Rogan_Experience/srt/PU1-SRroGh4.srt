1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,540
The joe rogan experience.
Just too many bongs out there.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,080
Right.
People still rock the bond though.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,370
Kind of respect that.
You know,

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,360
it's like driving a manual car.
I never was a Bongha.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,600
It's too heavy,
man.

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,860
I got shit to do,
man.

7
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:15,640
I can't,
oh,

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,700
the hitch just peeled down or the DAB
thing,

9
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:20,530
the,
I got friends in Colorado,

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,290
California now.
First time I ever did with Shit.

11
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,650
This is pretty embarrassing story,
but my,

12
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,510
uh,
my buddy,

13
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:29,830
you know,
they were all like California,

14
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:32,020
Colorado guys.
They roll pretty hard.

15
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,600
I'm not really a heavy smoker man,
to be honest on the road.

16
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,930
It keeps me occupied from time to time.
But if I'm writing maybe,

17
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:40,550
but at home,
you know,

18
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:41,920
it was no needs.
So it,

19
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,550
the first time I did that shit,
I didn't know what it was.

20
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,160
You know,
I just pulled it like it was a big old

21
00:00:48,161 --> 00:00:49,750
bong rip and they're like,
everybody's face was like,

22
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,003
oh,
you know,

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:51,731
it was like,
I need,

24
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:54,130
you instantly know you just did
something you shouldn't have.

25
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,510
Oh.
And uh,

26
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,730
I was like,
Oh fuck man.

27
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,660
So I sat down and looked at a couple of
minutes.

28
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:01,090
I just started getting really cold and
clammy and I was like,

29
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:02,320
Yep,
I'm going to Puke.

30
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,480
So I went over and was like,
I'm fucked this guy.

31
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,910
So puke right in the sink.
And I was like,

32
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:07,840
dude,
I gotta go home.

33
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,360
I feel like dog shit now.
And I'm pretty sure I'm dying.

34
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,080
So I had,
we lived in this apartment and I was

35
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:17,260
like went out the door and turned the
corner to go down the hallway to mind.

36
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:19,090
And it was full on vertigo like the
hall.

37
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:21,700
Every time I took a step,
the hall we got twice as long.

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,700
That was like,
this is fucked up.

39
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,050
My wife was out of the country on work
at the time and I was like,

40
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,610
I remember I was sitting down in the
hallway just like trying to get my shit

41
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,271
together,
man.

42
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:33,210
Cause I thought I was having a fucking
heart attack.

43
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:37,750
It's just like sweating.
And I remember this voice saying,

44
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,320
get up you stupid junkie.
Fuck before somebody comes out here and

45
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:43,360
sees you.
You know,

46
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:47,350
sitting in the hallway like a dumb ass.
And I managed to like pop out of it and

47
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:49,900
as soon as I got back to my place and
sit down in the couch,

48
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,550
everything was fine,
but it was just so initial and the rush,

49
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:55,310
I was just like,
I don't,

50
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,440
nobody needs to be that stone.
You know that fast.

51
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,333
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,331
Uh,
yeah,

53
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:04,430
we worked on talking about joey getting
in trouble though.

54
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:05,100
He just,
uh,

55
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,420
just texted me about it.
How's Joey get in trouble with let the

56
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:12,590
MMA community MMA outlets,
they have nothing to do.

57
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,720
Well,
here's the thing though.

58
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,970
I see where they're coming from.
They're,

59
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,990
they're journalists.
If someone says something that fucking

60
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:25,910
outrageous about what mackenzie durans
dairy air must,

61
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:26,744
uh,
he said,

62
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,370
I think your ass smells great right
there.

63
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,720
Something like something along those
lines.

64
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,350
You're talking about the comic Uncle
Joey said this?

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,620
Yes,
the Commodore Google Joey.

66
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,580
But I get it.
I get where they would and then vinny

67
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:38,870
magallanes backed him up.
Yeah,

68
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,850
I get it packed up joey.
Yeah,

69
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,591
I backed up.
Joe,

70
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,520
he says something like,
and tasty to,

71
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,500
yikes.
Yikes.

72
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,720
I get it.
I don't get it.

73
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,290
That's a Joey Diaz,
the great comic who's commenting on a

74
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,870
hot girl in the UFC.
He is not a writer.

75
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,630
He's not a journalist.
These riders have nothing to do.

76
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:58,100
So they're like,
how can we get hits?

77
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,770
Let's talk about Joey,
right.

78
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,850
Cause no one's reading any of our shit.
I agree with you in somewhat,

79
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,850
but he definitely did do it.
Like it ain't a bat.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,510
Here's my thing.
They could say whatever they want about

81
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:13,840
what he said,
but if he was your friend and he texted

82
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,890
you that you would do what I did cause
I'll show you.

83
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,740
He fucking texted me that before.
Tweet.

84
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,810
Of course.
I love the joey texts now.

85
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,820
Joey never would text message.
Oh,

86
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:31,090
I hope he doesn't keep your ideas as a
full on texting me.

87
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,170
He still calls though last week.
Most of the time he calls.

88
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,950
But um,
he texted me this.

89
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,020
Uh,
yeah,

90
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,740
it's Julie Diaz.
Manzi

91
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,020
sorry folks.
I wish I could let you in.

92
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,110
You can go and Google what he said.
I'll try and be respectful.

93
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,970
It's Joey Diaz.
He can say whatever he wants.

94
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,680
He doesn't work for the UFC.
He's not.

95
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,830
He's not.
I'm glad he does.

96
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,930
I'm glad he does think like that.
How do you know?

97
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:09,030
Send me texts like that.
But if I was a news website and it was

98
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,270
going to report out to,
first of all,

99
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,910
you want to play.
Yeah,

100
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,600
for sure.
That's what they want,

101
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,600
but also anybody who reads that,
I really,

102
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,030
you're either going to be like me or
you're like,

103
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,320
you're going to start laughing or you're
going to get really upset,

104
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,200
really upset,
and you're not a [inaudible] fan anyway.

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,990
It doesn't matter.
It's 95% of that is dudes read and I'm

106
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:32,500
like,
that's hilarious.

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,300
Yeah.
The 5% of like,

108
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,280
what the hell?
What are we doing?

109
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,100
How could you report this?
Yeah.

110
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:43,600
I think that's a good number.
95 95 that's hilarious.

111
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:46,120
I was wondering the same thing.
Some women will get upset though,

112
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,260
and rightly so.
If I had,

113
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,490
just to imagine if you were a dude and
there was some big Ole giant Alexander

114
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,070
Corel and looking dude who wanted to
fuck you and he was always making jokes

115
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,720
about what your butthole must smell
like.

116
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,100
Just stop.
Just stop and think of what that would

117
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,690
feel like.
That wouldn't be a good time.

118
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,800
If you're Mckenzie,
if you're anybody that someone is saying

119
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:13,640
those things about right.
I would just be,

120
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:15,980
and just trying to be open mind cause
you're not going off

121
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,360
a little bit.
Turn social justice.

122
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,160
I'm fucking account.
I came out.

123
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,600
It's not possible,
but what I'm saying is if you look at it

124
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:30,601
from the position of the person,
the person who's buttholes in question,

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,430
that would be an uncomfortable position
to in right.

126
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,940
Bunch of people talking about what your
butthole smelled like.

127
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,120
We just try to make a living on TV.
I just tried to make a living.

128
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,640
Just tried to trick a girl.
You know what that it's,

129
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,360
it's also Joey Dheas being
complimentary.

130
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,270
Yeah.
It'd be one thing if she was not an

131
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:52,780
attractive female shut like that.
She's obviously very attractive,

132
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,120
which is what makes us funny.
I agree 100%.

133
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,430
There's definitely people that are bored
with though like enough.

134
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,060
Well they Hollywood's over.
I think Hollywood tends to be,

135
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,180
what bothers me about Hollywood is their
virtual virtue signaling.

136
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,450
Like they're going to set an example.
You fucking guys like you want to be

137
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,080
liked.

138
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,900
Okay.
And you're as fickle as it gets.

139
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,260
They were the same people that were
standing up and clapping for Roman

140
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,490
Polanski.
I'm sorry man.

141
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,160
Well some of them were,
some of them were really saying some

142
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,150
ridiculous shit.
I mean guys,

143
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,410
it's a long time ago and he's drugged
and sodomized.

144
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:27,470
A 13 year old,
I think he was like more than one too.

145
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,750
Yeah.
So guess what?

146
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,480
I can't have that guy.
You're not kidding.

147
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,580
They wanted to sign a petition to bring
them back in the country.

148
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't forgive that.
No stay in France.

149
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,260
Well they want to bring it back to the
country to arrest them and they're

150
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:45,770
really trying hard to do that.
And there's people that resist that.

151
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,800
I think he's an amazing artist and you
know,

152
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,130
artists are just be consistent though,
you know you can system.

153
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,360
That's where I draw the line.

154
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,660
You can't drug kids fucking with the HR
Argento who was one of the,

155
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,820
one of the people that came out against
Harvey Weinstein,

156
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,840
she had been raped by him apparently.
And then she had a sexual relationship

157
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:04,580
with for 10 years afterwards,
which by the way,

158
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,160
people are like Ah,
that I actually forgive that because

159
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,450
people go back to the trauma,
right?

160
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,710
They want to relive it on their own
terms.

161
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,610
But she signed the petition to for,
for Roman Polanski to,

162
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,240
you know,
to be freed when he was put under arrest

163
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:20,930
and I believe it was Switzerland.
And now that's not consistent.

164
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,850
I'm sorry man.
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:22,851 --> 00:07:26,360
But if that guy is just as bad as yeah,
you can see the petition online.

166
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:31,361
What was her perspective?
She was somebody who thought Roman

167
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,020
Polanski should not be prosecuted for
something that happened a long time ago.

168
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:38,990
She signed that petition.
I would never sign that petition.

169
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,930
So there's a lot of disconnect.
So I have a big problem with that sort

170
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,040
of disconnect.
That's a problem.

171
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,230
I don't know this woman,
I don't know her.

172
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,480
Um,
I believe her.

173
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,670
I believe what she says about Harvey
Weinstein.

174
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,350
Uh,
and again,

175
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:51,981
I,
you know,

176
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,480
people are like,
well she went back to the scene of the

177
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,740
crime.
That's very common,

178
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:59,741
but don't sign a petition and then now
be this leading voice in this whole,

179
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,590
you know,
anti harassment.

180
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:03,650
It's like,
I think it's very inconsistent.

181
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,600
I think you have to pay,
you have to at least answer to that.

182
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,240
Did she comment on,
she signed,

183
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,790
there was a mia culpa there,
but it's very inconsistent in it and

184
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,780
there's a lot of that up.

185
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,470
So No,
a bunch of my s team members are going

186
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:20,670
to shoot me in the face for talking
about this because in the face,

187
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,770
yeah,
literally in the face.

188
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:27,771
Because one thing that was an ongoing
thing when I was on the u s team,

189
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,340
we,
there was this thing that went on about

190
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,230
how long we could go at a tournament
before we talked about this particular

191
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:41,820
person.
So during my time on the teams,

192
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,850
we actually had a person that was,
um,

193
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,990
she claimed to have a medical disorder
or she didn't actually claim to have it,

194
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:56,130
but supposedly it happens,
but she claimed have a disorder where

195
00:08:56,131 --> 00:09:01,131
she had attachment to items.
This girl that was on my team actually

196
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:06,660
ended up marrying the Eiffel Tower.
Are you serious?

197
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,750
I'm not kidding.
She and she had an attachment to

198
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,740
a loving,
she actually filed some claims against,

199
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,490
supposedly filed some claims against a
bow company that this boat company

200
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:28,161
actually had a rubber laminate on the
limbs of the bow and

201
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,060
is Mary's I fuck hour has that her?
Wow.

202
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,080
She Man Harris is famous monument.
I wrote a many buses with you,

203
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,620
Roy with her.
Yeah.

204
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,090
Oh my God.

205
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,170
Cool.

206
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,540
She's a former soldier who lives in San
Francisco.

207
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,370
She has been in love with the objects
before.

208
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,190
Their first infatuation was with lance,
a bow that helped her become a world

209
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:57,240
class.
Our chair,

210
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,440
she is fond of the Berlin Wall and she
claims to have a physical relationship

211
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,480
with a piece of fence.
She keeps in her bedroom and the fuck.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,980
What I doing?
What do we do with people?

213
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,420
We can't,
we can't do this.

214
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,920
We've gotten too crazy.
We got to pull back.

215
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:23,070
We got to pull back.
Here's the thing,

216
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,830
Mary,
a fucking bridge.

217
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,010
Just pitch.
Married a bridge.

218
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,070
She married a Brooklyn.
She's married the Eiffel Tower.

219
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,710
This bitch is marrying a bridge though.
Just kissing,

220
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,670
kissing bridges,
parts of being in love with a public

221
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,850
object.
But what the fuck does she just say?

222
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,350
You love the public object.
The crank that up.

223
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,720
I want to hear this crazy lady.
I feel very,

224
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:51,350
very blessed to have a piece of my sweet
Golden Gate Bridge.

225
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,940
Oh,
Jesus stopped.

226
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,650
I give up.
I'm out

227
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:00,440
my new there,
as long as I could love with the bridge.

228
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:10,610
Okay.
