1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,800
And we're live,
so it was nice to take a break,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,110
man.
Taking a break from anything is a good

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:08,520
move.
It's really is.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,350
Take just a few days off the podcast.
Get all excited to come back and do it.

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah.
Little refresher.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,250
A little refresher.
So,

7
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,150
um,
what's up brother?

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,050
How are you?
Good to see you.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,540
I'm good man.
We going on there.

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,370
Oh,
this is my shirt that uh,

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,260
talks about how George Washington was
alive today.

12
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:28,960
They throw him in jail because he was
smoking weed and murdering.

13
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:30,790
Yeah.
He,

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,010
he grew pot,
right?

15
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:33,300
Yeah.
And he was pretty open about it.

16
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,580
He talked about how they should sow that
seed everywhere.

17
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,480
It's like,
it's amazing.

18
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:38,070
It's a miracle plant.
Makes me feel good.

19
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,200
It's good for good for clothes.
Could paper.

20
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,600
Did they smoke it though?
Did the founding fathers smoke it?

21
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,450
You know,
there's not like a lot of direct

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,990
reports.

23
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,850
I don't think about them actually
smoking it,

24
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,400
but if they hadn't figured that out,
they're pretty savvy.

25
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,830
I think they got that down.
I wondered though,

26
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,190
because if you were like growing
something and you were using it for one

27
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:58,590
thing,
like say if you were growing Kale and

28
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,180
you were eating it,
you wouldn't be like,

29
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:05,181
let's smoke this shit.
Like live your whole life and not know

30
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,880
the Kale could get you to God's front
door.

31
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,700
You don't think that smell though,
you know,

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,720
they're just like,
miss that smell,

33
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:14,800
this herb.
They would have eaten it.

34
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,240
Have made a tea out of it.
They would have done something isn't it?

35
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,950
Doesn't have to be cooked though.
In order to be psychoactive.

36
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,890
I'm the worst pothead ever.
I should know this.

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,380
I'm like such a pot advocate.
I should know.

38
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,810
Like if you're going to get in trouble
and you eat a bunch of your pot,

39
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,530
do you get high up?

40
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,350
I don't really.
I'm pretty sure you don't.

41
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,220
Wow.
Yeah.

42
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:40,221
I think that's one of the reasons why
people really enjoy a juice pot.

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,710
Apparently the health benefits of
juicing pot,

44
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,240
of taking the fresh non dried leaves and
doing it like wheat grass juice is

45
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,190
incredible.
It's supposed to be really good for you.

46
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,450
I believe that.
Yeah.

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,740
Yeah,
and it smell.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,840
It doesn't smell like something you want
to eat,

49
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,750
you know,
like if you smell pot it's like it's

50
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,460
aromatic.
It's a beautiful plant.

51
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,540
A flag of tea.
Yeah.

52
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,570
That was out in the wild data probably.
Fuck you up.

53
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,510
I think it's a fat issue though.
That's why they always do it with

54
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,860
butter,
you know?

55
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,530
I think it's a or the oils I should
know.

56
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,110
Goddammit.
Well we got it.

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,150
People get so mad when you don't know
things.

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,580
Pothead Carter's going to get revoked.

59
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,240
Research.
Well,

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,730
I definitely know it can get you high.
I'll vouch for that.

61
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,691
But no,
I don't think.

62
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:27,010
I just still think eating it raw can.
But um,

63
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,210
um,
people get so pissed off if you were

64
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:34,650
wrong about anything in these long
rambling shit.

65
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,100
Talking sessions.
No vetting of information.

66
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,070
Two thousand 16 man.
Enough.

67
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,430
Enough of your misinformation and I
don't know,

68
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,490
I don't know if it but it does it.
It is amazing though that all these guys

69
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:53,830
used it for so many different things and
somehow along the line,

70
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,230
just a couple hundred years later,
it became demonized and got people

71
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:01,390
locked up in jail.
Very Declaration of independence written

72
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,690
on the plant that got made illegal and
one of the drafts,

73
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,580
yeah,
one of the drafts is written on hemp

74
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:09,700
paper and papers the best.
Have you ever had him paper before?

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,030
Now it's insanely durable.
It's really weird.

76
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,930
It's such a weird plant.
There's a weird thing about marijuana is

77
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,990
have you ever held a stock a marijuana
tree stock?

78
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,400
Now it's incredible because it feels
like styrofoam in in,

79
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:27,940
in terms of like how light it is,
but it's really hard like oak.

80
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,360
It's bizarre.
It's a fucking alien plant.

81
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,910
It really is.
If you stop and think about all the

82
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:38,911
things that that one plant provides,
it has a full amino acid profile,

83
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,200
but almost like a meat only.
There's only a few other plants I

84
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:49,201
believe keenwah and a couple others are
similar in that they have a full amino

85
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,630
acid profile.
You can make oil that you could.

86
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,800
You could heat your house with it,
you could build a house with it with

87
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,960
hempcrete.
Ever seen that hempcrete stuff,

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,140
but I've heard my God,
they make concrete with hemp and

89
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:07,141
apparently has antimicrobial properties
where it makes it really an effective

90
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,050
building method and places that have a
lot of mold,

91
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,050
like high mold content,
like high moisture content.

92
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,150
It's insanely durable.
It apparently will last forever.

93
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,950
It's really light.
This is hempcrete.

94
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,810
This is the shit you make this with.
Hemp has massive installation

95
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:27,980
properties.
Yeah.

96
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:30,490
Energy efficient.
It really is like an alien gift.

97
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,120
Yeah,
it's crazy.

98
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,890
Just went down and said,
here you go,

99
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:37,510
humans for so many things.
Have you seen all the stuff they're

100
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:42,470
doing with cbd oil and children that
have epilepsy?

101
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,340
I have been following that closely.
Fucking wipes it out.

102
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,620
You know,
another thing apparently there's really

103
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,190
good for children that have epilepsy is
going into ketosis.

104
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,230
Akita genic diet apparently like high
fat,

105
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,540
high fat content foods low a low simple
carbohydrate foods.

106
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,060
Yeah.
Apparently has a radical effect on

107
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,280
children with epilepsy.
It makes sense.

108
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:09,160
You know,
I mean a lot of what the brain is brain

109
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,130
is mostly made up of fat,
you know,

110
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,380
and I think a lot of times we don't pay
attention to the raw materials that our

111
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,400
body's made up of.

112
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,590
You know,
like your brain is made up of largely

113
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,430
fatty content and it's shown in a lot of
different studies that fat is good for

114
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:23,800
the brain.
So these issues that are coming from the

115
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:26,230
brain,
maybe there's an issue with some of the

116
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,600
raw material,
maybe you just supply it more of what

117
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,030
it's made of.
Yeah,

118
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,230
that's probably.
That makes sense.

119
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,880
And also what makes sense to me is that
that's what people ate for thousands and

120
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:40,900
thousands of years.
They just ate plants that grew out of

121
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,690
the ground,
like normal stuff and meats and fishes

122
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,500
and whatever.
They could get a fishes the fish and you

123
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,500
know,
and whatever they could catch and eat.

124
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,830
They didn't have spaghetti,
you know,

125
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,110
they didn't have all this stuff that we
fucking love now.

126
00:05:56,111 --> 00:05:58,160
Bread bread is awesome.

127
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,530
Goddammit.
Bread is why is it so bad for you?

128
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,010
Well really,
I mean there's a lot of people who argue

129
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:07,010
that the bread is only bad for you
because of how we prepare it.

130
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,270
We allow the heat to dry,
which has it developed this heightened

131
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,970
layer,
this kind of protective layer so that

132
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,880
the seed could survive,
you know,

133
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,200
conditions where it wasn't going
directly into the soil,

134
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,420
you know,
seeds or have evolved to survive.

135
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,670
And the way that we prepare it,
it's not germinated,

136
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,420
sprouted.
So that hard layer is what makes it

137
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,330
really hard to digest.
Or if you get like a sprouted bread,

138
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,250
you know,
a lot of people say that the health

139
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:35,600
benefits are pretty good and all,
and a lot of the negative is mitigated.

140
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,910
That's interesting.
And that's what I eat most of the time.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,490
And he did Zucchini bread,
which is a sprouted bread,

142
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,630
which,
uh,

143
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,440
not nearly is delicious now.

144
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,770
It's definitely not.
Definitely not.

145
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,470
The other one that's supposedly good is
sour dough bread because sourdough,

146
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,210
they use,
uh,

147
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,043
it's,
you know,

148
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,730
they have a culture in there that's
fermenting,

149
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,440
that's what's actually causing it to be
sour.

150
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,900
And that's partially digesting some of
that,

151
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,120
uh,
the hard parts of the wheat to digest.

152
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:03,560
So it's almost coming to you like pre
digest it a little bit by the bacteria

153
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:06,350
that makes it sour.
So it's a lot easier on your stomach.

154
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,820
Yeah,
I'd heard that.

155
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:10,340
Right.
Like for even there's some gluten free

156
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,660
versions of sourdough bread,
[inaudible],

157
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,220
which is a apparently even better.
I have something I haven't,

158
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,020
I haven't done anything with it.
There's a lot of.

159
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,150
The problem is,
is that when your stomach gets

160
00:07:20,151 --> 00:07:22,130
inflammation,
it doesn't just go locally in your

161
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:24,380
stomach.
Then it creates these proinflammatory

162
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,790
cytokines which go cross the blood clot
in the bloodstream into the blood brain

163
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,590
barrier and then you get that Kinda
like,

164
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,500
foggy,
shitty feeling throughout your whole

165
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:33,920
body.

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,521
You know,
I mean,

167
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,560
a lot of people talk about it like leaky
gut,

168
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,840
but when inflammation is there and the
gut,

169
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:42,530
it's a lot easier for it to go systemic.
And so keeping that,

170
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,620
keeping that down to a minimum is really
key for,

171
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,580
you know,
performance.

172
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah.
Pasta Comas are legit for sure.

173
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,150
Fucking real mature.
Like,

174
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,450
my mom used to make this insane lasagna
and you'd eat the Lasagna,

175
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:01,451
you better know how many plans bitch
is on using your system.

176
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:03,690
That ricotta.
And

177
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,180
it was so good though,
God dammit.

178
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,660
And um,
I've had gluten free pasta written

179
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,550
recently.
I've been getting into that.

180
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,740
I wished I'm so glad Joey Diaz isn't
here.

181
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,950
He'd be screaming fucking gluten,
but it doesn't give you the same effect.

182
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,230
It's like you get but you don't have
that.

183
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,220
Oh,
like that.

184
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,150
A lot of people associate with a good
meal and feeling of just being,

185
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,070
just sedated.
Like,

186
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,180
oh,
that was great.

187
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:32,991
You know,
it's,

188
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:36,560
it's weird how that works until you have
to do something.

189
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,730
Exactly.
It's like,

190
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,670
shit,
I got work to do or have that big lunch.

191
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:43,310
And you got meetings afterwards and
you're just pounding coffee.

192
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,730
Just like get it together to death
doesn't work.

193
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,520
It doesn't really work that well.
She is the way to go.

194
00:08:49,521 --> 00:08:50,390
Right,
for sure.

195
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,150
If you're in that situation,
you really should be pounding enzymes,

196
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,010
digestive enzymes,
and even additional if you

197
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,080
really have a difficult meal,
you know,

198
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:01,860
taking some hydrochloric acid along with
the enzymes is going to be great.

199
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:03,500
But enzymes are,
are key.

200
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,510
You know,
it's,

201
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,400
it's so fascinating for me that for the
longest time when people thought about

202
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:10,380
food and nutrition,
they f they thought,

203
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:13,080
well,
he eat a healthy balanced diet and you

204
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,340
know,
that's pretty much it.

205
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,530
That's really all you need.
If you want to be a sensible person,

206
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,350
if you want to really push the fringes
like Jacqueline Lane,

207
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,740
he used to fucking eat a bucket of pills
everyday.

208
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,700
Didn't he?
Didn't,

209
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,680
wasn't Jack Lillian like a crazy
supplement taker guy?

210
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,670
I wouldn't surprise me.
Yeah,

211
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,190
I'm pretty sure he was.
Um,

212
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,450
or uh,
another one is a homeboy.

213
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,520
The guy wants to live forever.
Ray Kurzweil Kurzweil,

214
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,860
he explained to me.
I interviewed him once for this Scifi

215
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,470
show.
It was so fucking cool.

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Just me and Ray Kurzweil chilling in his
apartment in San Francisco for like an

217
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,720
hour and a half talking about to life
and possibilities and all the potential

218
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:59,070
future technologies that are going to
extend our life thousands and thousands

219
00:09:59,070 --> 00:09:59,370
of years.

220
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,530
But that guy,
he doesn't fuck around.

221
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,530
He takes a gigantic bucket of pills
everyday,

222
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:07,050
which I'm not sure is the right way to
do it,

223
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,903
you know?
I don't know.

224
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,890
Sure.
I don't know.

225
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,490
Is it foods?
Is it foods and supplements?

226
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,440
I think you've got to really just look
at what,

227
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,370
you know,
what you particularly need to know and

228
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,970
just targeted for that.
You know,

229
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,190
I think a lot of things are what you
want,

230
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,710
you know,
a lot of it is just like,

231
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,030
what's going to help your performance?
What's going to help you reach your

232
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,200
goal?
Like what is your goal?

233
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,340
For him,
it's live forever,

234
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:28,530
so he's probably trying a bunch of
different things,

235
00:10:28,531 --> 00:10:30,420
but he's a little bit frantic about
that.

236
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,240
He's a little concerned that he's not
gonna make it til this technology older

237
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,890
than us.
He's like 70,

238
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,930
70.
But what I was going to get at is that

239
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,500
when they started doing grass fed foods,
like grass fed beef became all the rage

240
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,980
and people start noticing the difference
in the actual size of the stakes,

241
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,540
like if you get a tenderloin or if you
get a New York strip from a grass fed

242
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,910
animal,
it's like can considerably smaller piece

243
00:10:56,911 --> 00:10:59,490
of meat and then the fat looks
different.

244
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,040
The fat is a yellow fat instead of a
white fat.

245
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,290
And then when I started getting into
hunting,

246
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,060
one of the weirder things that I've
found was Steven Rinella told me about

247
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:14,061
blueberry bears and that the most
delicious meat is these black bears in

248
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,430
Alaska and Canada as well.
Anywhere they have blueberries,

249
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,260
right?
When they're getting ready to get into

250
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,320
hibernation,
they feast on blueberries to the point

251
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:27,060
where their flesh smells like
blueberries and they're fat becomes

252
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:29,580
purple.
Like it changes your body.

253
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,410
And it made me think like,
what about fucking twinkies and shit?

254
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,510
You know,
what about Coca Cola?

255
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,940
What is all that doing?
Your fat content?

256
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,840
What is it doing to your body?
You know,

257
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:45,030
like how much of what you are like if
you ever smell someone that's like

258
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,820
unhealthy,
like give her a date and unhealthy girl

259
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,610
or your own self when you're sick.
Not Me Bro.

260
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,640
Good.
All the time.

261
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,193
Let's.

262
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,060
Yeah,
that'll,

263
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,930
that'll do it.
If you,

264
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,450
if the smell is.
I think that was one of our primal cues.

265
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,580
You sniff somebody and say,
are you healthy?

266
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,270
You know,
how's your,

267
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,980
how's your gut biome?
That's what someone's.

268
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,270
But you know,
like is that.

269
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,523
Yeah,
totally.

270
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,390
But I think um,
you know,

271
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,150
now we're in this paradigm where it's
not just you are what you eat because

272
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:16,900
that's really true.
Your body is made up of the input that

273
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,540
you eat 100 percent.
That's what makes up your body.

274
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,950
And I think we forget about that,
but.

275
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,680
So we're not only what we eat,
but what we're,

276
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,560
what we eat eight,
you know,

277
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:28,160
so we're what the animals ate because
their body's made up of what they ate.

278
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,830
And then when you're looking at
vegetables,

279
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:33,550
I think sometimes people ignore the fact
that the vegetables are drawing these

280
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:34,630
minerals from the soil.

281
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,630
So what's the soil like?
Is it soil that's been farm forever and

282
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:41,050
they just put a limited array of
fertilizer on there just enough to get

283
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,090
it to go,
well then maybe you're not getting

284
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:45,640
enough minerals because the plants don't
have enough minerals.

285
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,270
So I think that's scenario that I'm
really kind of looking keenly on because

286
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:52,000
the one thing that I've done this year
differently is really started

287
00:12:52,001 --> 00:12:55,840
supplementing with minerals and that's
made a huge difference in my energy

288
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,460
levels.
What are you doing?

289
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,150
I take a fulvic mineral and I take it a
couple of different ways.

290
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,190
What does that mean?
It's a different.

291
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,600
It's like fulvic acid.
It's a type of compound in the soil that

292
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:11,200
has a really wide array of trace
minerals and so you can get it.

293
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm pretty much from the United States.
You can get it from all over the place.

294
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:17,830
It's really like densely concentrated
old,

295
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,500
old vegetation,
you know,

296
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,340
that is turning,
turning the soil.

297
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,840
Um,
that.

298
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:25,360
And then Himalayan Sea salt of course is
another great resource.

299
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:27,790
But the combination of like
intentionally giving those,

300
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:33,030
I feel like I'm giving my body the
building blocks to make the body to do

301
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:36,070
what it needs to do.
Like all of our clans and skin and

302
00:13:36,071 --> 00:13:38,860
organs,
it's comprised largely of these elements

303
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,220
and minerals and these different things.
And I feel like sometimes the body's

304
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,470
reaching for spare parts and the garage
is empty.

305
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:46,270
It's like Duh,
what the hell?

306
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:49,090
I don't have this mineral that I need to
repair myself.

307
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,260
You know,
because it's not part of what

308
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:51,940
osteoporosis is.
Yeah.

309
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,790
Your body drawing calcium literally from
your bones.

310
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,680
Yep.
And then we do that naturally.

311
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:59,830
Another reason why we don't have that
many minerals is we do that naturally

312
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:03,100
when we run a little bit acidic.
So for drinking coffee and alcohol and

313
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:06,760
these things are Ph may not change,
but the reason it doesn't change is the

314
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:09,730
body uses the minerals from things like
the bones,

315
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,160
calcium carbonate,
which is the traditional antacid,

316
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,380
something that buffer the acid.

317
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,870
So it buffers the acid within the body
by utilizing available minerals.

318
00:14:18,871 --> 00:14:23,260
So we get an even a greater mineral
depletion if we're running more acidic,

319
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:26,140
which is one of the reasons why I think
an alkaline diet is helpful,

320
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,860
but you can kind of hack that by just
taking a lot more minerals so you have

321
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,500
more available to buffer out your acidic
diet,

322
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,220
not that you should be drinking booze
and eating sugar and coffee anyways,

323
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,680
but we're all going to do that.
We're all humans.

324
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:40,570
So if you're going to do that,
getting more minerals in your diet is

325
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,660
going to be huge.
What do you fuck around with colloidal

326
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:47,050
minerals?
We take that stuff into that for awhile

327
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,550
and I got some benefits of it,
but uh,

328
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,400
for whatever reason I stopped drinking
them.

329
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,190
Yeah.
You know,

330
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,530
for me it's just fulvic.
There's fulvic acid,

331
00:14:54,531 --> 00:14:55,220
humic acid.

332
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,990
I found that the humic acid a little
heavy,

333
00:14:56,991 --> 00:15:00,620
it weighs on my digestion,
but fulvic acid is a little cleaner.

334
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:03,560
I feel like I absorb it better.
So every time I'm making a drink,

335
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:07,130
I get those mountain valley spring
waters and my thing is just a little bit

336
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:09,800
of Himalayan salt,
maybe two grams and then a little scoop

337
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:14,801
of the fulvic mineral powder and um,
and drink that and huge difference and

338
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:18,050
I've given it to a lot of people who
have had some energy issues,

339
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,710
just things not going quite right and,
um,

340
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,050
made a huge difference.
So that's something I'm really kind of

341
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,580
looking at for 2016.
Nice.

342
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,543
Nice.
Um,

343
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,190
I'm going to get really in the
probiotics is here.

344
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,590
Yeah.
I had a Rhonda Patrick on the podcast

345
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:34,770
and she was talking to me about these
really powerful probiotics.

346
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,210
So I'm ordering those this week and I'm
going to get started on trying out

347
00:15:39,211 --> 00:15:42,570
different probiotics because I'm a
regular drinker of that Kombucha,

348
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,700
that stuff.
GTS,

349
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,990
Kombucha.
No bullshit.

350
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:49,730
I drank for a day,
three to four a day every day.

351
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,050
I mean,
I'm constantly restocking on that shit

352
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,150
and it makes a massive difference,
man.

353
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,440
Like having good gut biome having good
thing.

354
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,790
I've been eating a lot of his,
um,

355
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,870
raw sauerkraut and raw fermented beets.
Yeah.

356
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:08,070
Kimchi and fermented plants and foods,
when you're doing that,

357
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:11,480
you're.
You're literally taking in raw like

358
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,200
soldiers told to fight off all the other
shit that's going on inside your body.

359
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,420
I think that

360
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,720
absolutely.
The other big key that we all ignore,

361
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,670
you know,
all of us have taken these courses of

362
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,700
antibiotics and there's a recent study
that came out that showed it takes up to

363
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:29,900
a year for your gut biome to fully
recover from a course of antibiotics,

364
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,590
a single course of antibiotics,
so you're just basically detonating a

365
00:16:33,591 --> 00:16:35,660
nuclear bomb off in your stomach and
these,

366
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,910
these,
this gut flora is responsible for

367
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:40,430
neurotransmitter production and immune
system production.

368
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,690
All kinds of benefits and it may get
even crazier than that because there's

369
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:48,590
some animal studies now where they took
the gut biome of a really kind of chill

370
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,790
mouse and a really hyper mouse and they
switched the gut biomes of both of these

371
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:55,760
mice and their personality
characteristics changed.

372
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,270
So like a lot of what we are may be
related directly to our gut flora.

373
00:17:01,761 --> 00:17:06,761
So paying close attention to that I
think is that minerals is probably the

374
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,360
two most important things you could do.

375
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,960
That's a really insane thing when you
stop and think about it.

376
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,410
It was we,
I think we associate ourselves or we try

377
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:19,500
to think of ourselves as being some sort
of an independent entity like I may as

378
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,410
well.
I feel good when I have a cup of coffee

379
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:25,430
and a glass of orange juice.
But the idea that you literally are what

380
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:30,230
you've put into your body and that it
doesn't just fuel your body,

381
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,290
but it makes your body and your body
changes and varies dependent upon what

382
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,494
you're putting in.

383
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,180
Yeah.
We're like a trillion organisms actually

384
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,350
that just have one over mind so that
everything's not just warring with each

385
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:45,390
other and and making it like,
I need this,

386
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:47,700
I need.
We just have one over mine,

387
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:48,760
but it's really,
you know,

388
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,040
we're king of a trillion

389
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,290
cells and how are we going to be a good
ruler to these?

390
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,380
They're like our loyal subjects.
Like we have a little kingdom in our

391
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:56,970
body and are we going to be a good
ruler?

392
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,580
Are we going to be a shitty one that
just talks shit to him?

393
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,320
It gives him shit food and,
and you know,

394
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,600
taxes the hell out of them.
Mass too much.

395
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,870
Gives you little.
Well we have one voice where it comes

396
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,600
out of one hole,
but I don't necessarily know.

397
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,150
That's like one thing in there that's
running the show.

398
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,670
That's true because I think we like to
think that it is,

399
00:18:14,671 --> 00:18:18,420
but God dammit shifts loyalty and
direction.

400
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:20,130
It just,
it's all over the place.

401
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:25,131
The mind and who you know in quotes you,
when you think of yourself as me,

402
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,690
you know me when you think when you
yourself,

403
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,760
well,
I'm going to do this or I'm going to do

404
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:29,970
that.

405
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,590
I'm like,
what are you saying?

406
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,670
Like what do you.
What are you saying?

407
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,770
I'm going to lead the troops,
but who are you?

408
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,900
You change all the time,
motherfucker.

409
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,900
You're different whether or not you've
had a nap,

410
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,850
whether you've had a cup of coffee,
whether you're taken your Alpha brain,

411
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,730
you're fucking different all the time.
Like,

412
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:44,564
cool.
You Bitch.

413
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,250
You're so inconsistent.
Like what's going on in there?

414
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,720
Well,
what's going on there as you're an

415
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,110
ecosystem,
you're,

416
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:52,950
you're like,
it's like the jungle calling itself a

417
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:56,270
thing.
The jungles not authoring the jungle is

418
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,310
fucking millions of things all in a
cycle where the big ones are eating the

419
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,650
little ones and then the big ones die
and the little ones absorb it and it's

420
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:08,130
like this constant ever going thing
that's happening.

421
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,760
The idea of it being like the like a
lighter,

422
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,380
you know,
or like a brick,

423
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:13,620
you know?

424
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,620
It's not a fucking giant system of all
these and that's the body.

425
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,710
Very true.
Yeah.

426
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:24,360
I think there's this combination of also
the body and then consciousness and the

427
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:26,670
mind like all of these three different
things,

428
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,510
which I,
that's how I kind of organize it.

429
00:19:28,511 --> 00:19:30,060
There's the body,
then there's the mind,

430
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,970
ego,
and then there's your consciousness and

431
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,270
those are always different voices.
The body's more like a plant.

432
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,150
It's slow and it doesn't listen to the
mind that which moves,

433
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:41,970
like instantly the mind can think one
thing and the other thing,

434
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,090
but the body has fortunately has a big
lag.

435
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:46,200
It's way slower.
Otherwise,

436
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:48,000
they'd be getting mixed signals all over
the place,

437
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:51,660
so that inherently creates a conflict
because the mind moves at the speed of

438
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:53,610
light,
but the body moves slow,

439
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,810
so we have this built in system where
it's a little bit strange like we can

440
00:19:57,811 --> 00:20:00,690
want something for the body,
but it takes a while.

441
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,570
You gotta change the nutrients.
You got to do these different things and

442
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:07,470
I think that's a frustration point for
people with their bodies because their

443
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:11,220
mind is so fast and that's what they
identify with and they want the body to

444
00:20:11,221 --> 00:20:13,410
react.
But the body slow bodies like a plan.

445
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,450
Yeah.
Everybody wants that instant fix.

446
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,660
You know,
like you come off of hard drinking over

447
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:21,590
new years and you look at your gut and
you start pinching your fat and you're

448
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:22,620
like,
God damn it.

449
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,230
I got to change.
And then it's hard.

450
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,630
Like you wake up and you look at your
clock and like,

451
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:29,010
fuck,
I don't want to go to the gym.

452
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,800
If I go to sleep right now,
I could sleep for another hour and a

453
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:35,220
half before I have to go to work or I go
to the gym right now and you know what

454
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:37,830
you should do,
but your body's like,

455
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,220
come on man,
but then your brain is like,

456
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,650
what are we looking for?
We're looking for success.

457
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,660
We're looking to improve,
we're looking to feel good,

458
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,930
get up you fuck.
But it's,

459
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,160
it's

460
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,160
this conflict.
Constant conflict of trying to improve

461
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,250
and trying to be disciplined and trying
to get it all together.

462
00:20:57,251 --> 00:21:01,600
And then this fucking self sabotage
mechanism that somehow or another,

463
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,700
the vast majority of us have.

464
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,340
Yeah,
the inner bitch bitch.

465
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:07,300
Yes.
Yeah.

466
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,950
I think one of the most important
things,

467
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:11,380
and this is what I've really been
focusing on,

468
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:14,740
is having the ability to do what I call
mental override,

469
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,110
which is just where you just push
manually push that go button all the way

470
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,270
down and just do something that you
know,

471
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:25,780
you don't want to do because we're so
good at negotiating and justifying and

472
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,610
you know,
having these little arguments with

473
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:30,820
ourselves and sometimes you just need
that ability to just go,

474
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,110
okay,
we're doing this.

475
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,240
I don't care if you're scared,
that's cool.

476
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,130
You're going to be all right.
Mental override.

477
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:39,880
We're doing this and you can really use
that ability to choose,

478
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,290
you know,
in so many things.

479
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,810
You can even choose yourself in a better
mood.

480
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,670
You know,
I've experimented with that like you're

481
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,800
in a Shitty,
I'm in a shitty mood and like,

482
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:52,330
well maybe you just choose to listen to
a song that's not like a shitty mood

483
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:56,590
song and then you choose to.
You can jump from Lily Pad to Lily Pad,

484
00:21:56,591 --> 00:22:00,250
but you can choose your way out of a lot
of different things if you're willing to

485
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:02,770
do that.
If you have cultivated that skill to

486
00:22:02,771 --> 00:22:05,110
just push the hammer down and say,
all right,

487
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,850
I'm going to be happier right now.

488
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,470
It's that determinism thing that a lot
of people fall prey to.

489
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,820
It's like all the different
circumstances that have happened in your

490
00:22:16,821 --> 00:22:20,660
life.
All of your own trials and tribulations,

491
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:25,400
successes and failures,
all these things lead up to who you are

492
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:29,390
right now and sometimes the momentum of
those things is super hard for people to

493
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,120
break.
It's super hard for if you've always got

494
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:34,880
up in the morning and smoked a cigarette
and had a cup of coffee,

495
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,130
the one day you get up and you're like,
you know what?

496
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,930
I gotTa stop doing this.
I got to take care of my body.

497
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
Got To get off the cigarettes.
I got to figure out a way to have it,

498
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,370
but to to try to cultivate a bunch of
different inspirational things to get

499
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:55,940
you over that Hump I think is the way
like whether it's people like for me

500
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:59,030
there's a bunch of people that I call
upon in my mind in my mind,

501
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,340
like when I think of like a incredibly
disciplined top.

502
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,440
Like there's this guy that about on my
podcast before a great guy,

503
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,100
Jocko willink.
Jocko was fucking savage.

504
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,610
Yep.
Right.

505
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:13,220
He's the man every morning go to the
twitter page.

506
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,900
That motherfucker shows a photo of his
watch and it'll say 4:45 or 4:30 or

507
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:21,530
4:15.
This fucker is up every day before five

508
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,580
slinging lead,
just fucking lifting weights and he,

509
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,270
he'll show like puddles on the ground
after his workouts and then it'll show

510
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:33,830
like the sun coming up and he feels like
that gives him an advantage.

511
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,700
But in sending those images out there,
other people,

512
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:40,790
even people like me that.
I mean I don't necessarily have a

513
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:44,300
problem with discipline.
I'm a but I don't have the best

514
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:45,360
discipline.
Sure.

515
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,150
But I mean,

516
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,720
but it's pretty,
it's pretty good.

517
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,390
You know,
I'm pretty healthy but I'm still a fuck

518
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:53,710
up on occasion because I'm a comedian at
heart.

519
00:23:53,711 --> 00:23:57,260
I mean ultimately is that self-indulgent
personality that goes,

520
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,720
we're doing shots,
you know,

521
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,470
it's always there,
you know,

522
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:05,000
but when you see a guy like that that's
out there fucking going for it like

523
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,200
that,
guys like that,

524
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,180
they,
they breed like a little spark,

525
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,180
you know,
you're not even a little spark,

526
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,890
like a big spark.
So there's a few of those people that I

527
00:24:12,891 --> 00:24:15,200
follow,
a few people that I know,

528
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,050
a few people that have watched their
documentaries or a folder their,

529
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,530
you know,
their workout routines and you just,

530
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,680
you just got to cultivate those things.
Just sort of like,

531
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,400
he cultivate information.
You can have a conversation with no

532
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,480
data,
you can't,

533
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,850
you literally have nothing to talk
about.

534
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,850
If you haven't experienced anything of
you haven't taken any information,

535
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,570
will that information much like food is
fuel for your body,

536
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,840
that information is fuel for your mind,
for your personality and for the way you

537
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:49,160
view the world.
Like your overall projection or

538
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,420
interpretation of the world itself is
based on how much data you take in,

539
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,660
which is one of the reasons why it's so
important to surround yourself with good

540
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,310
people.
No,

541
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,080
Duh.
I mean people generally move by one of

542
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,360
two forces,
inspiration or desperation.

543
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,850
It's way better to get an get in early
on the inspiration tip,

544
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,580
wait for desperation.
It causing,

545
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,540
oh,
I had a heart attack.

546
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,040
That's why I changed my diet,
or Oh,

547
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,810
I'm going to die,
so now it's time,

548
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:15,050
but if you can move from inspiration,
you know you're going to be way,

549
00:25:15,051 --> 00:25:17,390
but way better off.
But there's something else too,

550
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:22,130
which is just the ethos like you know,
and all warrior cultures develop this.

551
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,210
The Samurai had the Bushido,
the spartans had their ethos and it's

552
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:29,750
something where you just decide
something that just doesn't have.

553
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,250
There's no room for negotiation anymore.
This is not a negotiable item.

554
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:36,800
You don't need inspiration.
You don't need desperation because it's

555
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:41,420
no longer on the table for negotiation
and I think that's part of that ability

556
00:25:41,421 --> 00:25:44,270
to just choose something and create your
own ethos.

557
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:48,650
Like maybe your ethos is I don't smoke
cigarettes anymore and that is my ethos.

558
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:53,310
It is non negotiable.
Like that is part of my code and

559
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,990
developing something that's so,
so strong that it's not even on the

560
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,800
table for negotiation,
you know,

561
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,110
and I think it's important to use all of
those different facets.

562
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:04,840
Like for the spartans it was,
you know,

563
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,120
never retreat for the Samurai.
It was always keep on or you know,

564
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,090
whatever their Bushido it was pretty
wide code,

565
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,220
but you know,
and all of those things,

566
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:16,010
there were these just these things that
wouldn't break.

567
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,990
So when it came time to,
you know,

568
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,590
take the sword to protect your honor
into your own gut.

569
00:26:21,591 --> 00:26:22,490
You know,
how hard that is.

570
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,600
I can't even cut my little finger,
cut my finger.

571
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,970
You mentioned like sticking a sword,
but it was just non negotiable.

572
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,620
Like it was so deeply ingrained and so I
think all of us should spend time

573
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:36,440
creating our own ethos.
Like what is our ethos?

574
00:26:36,441 --> 00:26:39,530
And don't get too crazy with it.
Like I'm never going to eat sugar.

575
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,550
Come on man.
I mean,

576
00:26:40,551 --> 00:26:42,380
give yourself a little bit of sugar
every now and then.

577
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,860
Don't make that ethos

578
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,170
but create something that's just non
negotiable.

579
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,870
Well,
I think cheat days are really good for

580
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:52,170
the mind.
Cheat meals are really good for the mind

581
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,540
and that even though it's not good to
take in like an entire pizza in one

582
00:26:57,661 --> 00:27:00,810
setting,
knowing that you allow yourself that

583
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:05,811
possibility every now and then actually
relaxes the imagination and relaxes the,

584
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,590
the resistance to discipline because I
feel,

585
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:13,410
at least me personally,
I don't like rules.

586
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,530
I don't like.
I mean one of the reasons why I became

587
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:20,880
who I am and the path that I chose as
far as like what I chose to do in life

588
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,900
just because I didn't like people
telling me what to do.

589
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:28,800
I didn't like the idea of school.
I didn't like them telling me I had to

590
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:33,801
learn this right now for whatever dumb
reasons and when you grow up with this

591
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:39,921
idea that confirm conforming is bad and
that following orders makes you a robot

592
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,450
and a slave.

593
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,430
Fuck that man.
I'm going to be my own person will be a

594
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:47,490
free spirit.
I'm going to put tie dye on fucking

595
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,460
hitchhike across the country.
Here you have these ideas that the,

596
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,610
the sort of patterns that everybody else
is following,

597
00:27:53,611 --> 00:27:56,550
they're only following them because
they've been told to and you don't have

598
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:57,241
to do that,
man.

599
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:59,400
It's bullshit.
We're all just organisms.

600
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:00,780
We're all just living on this life
together.

601
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,260
So you kinda get,
get into this mindset where you don't

602
00:28:04,261 --> 00:28:07,950
want to have any rigidity.
You don't want to have any,

603
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,600
uh,
any hard fast rules,

604
00:28:09,601 --> 00:28:13,680
but that's not necessarily empowering to
you as an individual.

605
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,970
One of the things I'm really fond of
saying is that you only appreciate rest

606
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,340
when you've earned it.
Yeah.

607
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:22,390
Like,
I don't appreciate rest unless I've

608
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:25,980
fucking busted my ass and those have
worked out hard.

609
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,860
Got All my work done,
got all my shit,

610
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:30,210
all my.
If I have anything that's fucking with

611
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,530
me in the back of my head,
it,

612
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,100
it haunts me.
You know,

613
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,580
it,
it bothers me and I can appreciate

614
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,070
relaxation.
It does not worth anything anymore.

615
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,700
If I come home from doing nothing and I
sit down in front of the television,

616
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:45,600
I may enjoy whatever I'm watching.
I might enjoy it because it's good

617
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,130
information or it's good stimulation,
but I'm not going to enjoy that

618
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,680
relaxation.
I'm not gonna.

619
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,760
Enjoy that.
That thing and I've earned it.

620
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:57,240
Yeah,
I mean you have a natural seeking of

621
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,870
your own kind of balance and I think
that's what's important is having that

622
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:02,910
compass to say like,
alright,

623
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,200
I've worked this hard and now it's time
to take off and just let the stress go

624
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:10,500
and I think that's an important line of
delineation something that I struggle

625
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:14,010
with too because I'll finish a long day
at the office and they'll come back and

626
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:17,400
I'll work and I'll be constantly.
Even when I'm like with Whitney trying

627
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:20,130
to watch a movie,
I'm thinking about what I could be doing

628
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:21,840
instead of just saying,
all right man,

629
00:29:21,841 --> 00:29:23,390
just take this two hours.
Yeah,

630
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,170
really rest.
You're off.

631
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,530
You're off duty man and clock out.
And I think that's an important thing to

632
00:29:28,531 --> 00:29:32,400
kind of restore and yet again,
it's that same thing like taking a

633
00:29:32,401 --> 00:29:34,860
break,
like allow yourself that opportunity to

634
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:36,670
let the stress go.
You know,

635
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,660
when you've done the work.
But if you're on the other side and

636
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:42,010
you're just not really doing anything,
you know,

637
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,670
and you're just kind of relaxing and
that's starting to create the stress,

638
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,660
then you got to go to the other side of
the pendulum and kick some serious ass

639
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,450
first before you start worrying about
the rest.

640
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:55,690
So it's just about like striking that
right balance in your life.

641
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,890
God,
that's so important.

642
00:29:56,891 --> 00:30:00,010
The right balance of so God damn
important because you don't want to be

643
00:30:00,011 --> 00:30:03,970
that fucking psychopath that just burns
everything in front of you and just

644
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:07,540
hacks at the land trying to achieve
victory because that,

645
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,620
unless you're a fighter,
I think that if you're competing,

646
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,030
if you're fighting like,
well,

647
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:17,080
I'm a big fan of saying that if you,
if you want to fight,

648
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,800
if this is what you want to do,
it has to be completely singular pursuit

649
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,813
you.
You can't.

650
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,000
I want to fight.
And I also want to open up an organic

651
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,090
peach jam business and I know what I
mean and I also want to start marathon

652
00:30:31,001 --> 00:30:35,230
running and I'm also really involved in
this and that and that and this man,

653
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:39,910
if you want to be someone who's doing
something so insanely dangerous that

654
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:45,150
it's probably as far as pursuits in
sport fighting is probably one of the

655
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:51,100
all time most dangerous things you could
possibly do other than like maybe bmx,

656
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,810
flying those flips,
those guys do have ramps and like ski

657
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:58,570
jumping,
like the shit that he does when he's

658
00:30:58,571 --> 00:30:59,830
fucking flying down a hill.

659
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,110
Like Jesus Christ.
Like that's insanely dangerous too.

660
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:05,960
But like a singular pursuit.
Yeah,

661
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:08,170
I think you can only do it for a few
years.

662
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,170
Like maybe at the most 10 or something
like that.

663
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:14,620
But I think to,
to be like a fade or a million inco in

664
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:17,830
his prime,
that motherfucker was probably gone.

665
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,060
I mean he was probably in that zone all
the time,

666
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,230
like Anderson when he was in his prime
other than pussy and food.

667
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,170
I bet that dude was pretty locked in,
you know,

668
00:31:29,171 --> 00:31:31,480
in the few recreational activities,
video games,

669
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:35,770
what have you,
but you need to achieve that state of

670
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:40,540
like high revolution excellence.
You almost have to be like unhealthy.

671
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,390
Yeah,
I mean I talked to a really successful

672
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:46,750
person that I know and he said that he
limits himself always two,

673
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:49,600
three things.
Like he will not allow himself to focus

674
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:53,110
on anything more than three things and
that was kind of interesting for me

675
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:56,560
because I love creating these little
different things and working on these

676
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,310
different projects.

677
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,510
He's like,
for me,

678
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:02,770
three things is the maximum and that's
what I forceably cut myself off with and

679
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:04,930
I think that's something good to keep in
mind.

680
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:08,830
You can only really genuinely work on
three things at a time and maybe when

681
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:12,520
you're a fighter that just narrows down
even more to just one thing.

682
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,870
Right?
Because you have those disciplines

683
00:32:13,871 --> 00:32:15,310
you're working on,
you're working on the grappling,

684
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:17,440
discipline,
striking disciplines and maybe those are

685
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:18,460
your three things.
Wrestling,

686
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:19,840
striking,
not like nuts.

687
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,700
That's it.
That's all you have time for.

688
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:24,310
If you're going to be the greatest,
maybe that's why Thailand so good for

689
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,830
those guys.
Just you just pay for sex.

690
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,820
You just take that off the table.
Not even an issue.

691
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:32,680
Yeah.
Just go to the massage parlor or

692
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:35,200
whatever you do.
Get your joint worked out.

693
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,250
Yeah,
no doubt.

694
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,083
Yeah,
I know.

695
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,043
I think,
um,

696
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,783
where

697
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:44,900
everybody's sort of trying to find this
zone that makes them feel the best,

698
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,900
that makes them feel the most satisfied,
the most comfortable,

699
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,260
the least crazy,
the least disappointed.

700
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:54,830
You just want to find this and
everybody's zone is different.

701
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,370
Like some people,
they don't have this and burning

702
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:01,580
ambition to succeed.
They don't have lofty goals,

703
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:06,550
they just want to be happy or they want
to pursue whatever are in they enjoyed

704
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,870
doing.
Maybe it's maybe like painting or

705
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:12,140
something like that.
They just enjoy creating painting,

706
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,540
you know,
creating a piece of art that someone's

707
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,040
going to look at and it looks kind of
cool.

708
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:20,900
I think that's really important to not
take what societies when is and make it

709
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:23,840
your own.
You have your very own wind and that

710
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:27,560
could be chilling at the beach surfing
and occasionally painting and that's

711
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,930
your win and if somebody else is trying
to tell you,

712
00:33:29,931 --> 00:33:31,370
oh,
you got to do something with your life,

713
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:31,910
fuck that.

714
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:34,730
That's just a counter force,
like if you really track what your

715
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:39,500
mission is and what you love to do,
then do that thing you know and don't

716
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:43,490
let these other things tell you that
you're not succeeding or try and make

717
00:33:43,491 --> 00:33:48,080
you conform to what society says is
success because that's a bunch of

718
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:50,690
bullshit.
We each have our own version of that and

719
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,360
I think it's the most important thing we
can do to stay true to that,

720
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,840
but it does seem to me that everybody
needs something.

721
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,640
We were like,
sure,

722
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,250
whatever those things are.
These interests that people have,

723
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,620
they seem to be like vehicles for
happiness,

724
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:08,390
like the mind almost from being
developed at the time we were monkeys to

725
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:11,000
what we are now.
The mind has gone through all these

726
00:34:11,001 --> 00:34:13,970
different activities and has gone
through all these trials and

727
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:16,250
tribulations and the struggles for
survival.

728
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:20,090
So there's almost like this built in
mechanism in the mind to problem solve

729
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,810
and to deal with things and either to
create like for a lot of people that's a

730
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:28,790
big one or to achieve or to accomplish
or to get over the hump and when you're

731
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,280
not fighting for your life and you're
not struggling,

732
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,640
those,
those don't get fed and these sort of

733
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:39,641
genetically ingrained reward systems,
they seem to be like built into the

734
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,550
system of being a person they don't get
addressed.

735
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,240
And I think that's one of the reasons
why a lot of people feel lost.

736
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,670
They feel they feel like depressed and
unsatisfied because what they're

737
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:55,490
choosing to pursue is not really
interesting to them.

738
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,960
Like there was a threat on my message
board where someone was,

739
00:34:58,961 --> 00:34:59,301
uh,
it was,

740
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:01,370
it became like a big crazy fucking
argument,

741
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:03,050
like all threads and all message boards
do.

742
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,950
But it started off interesting where
someone was saying that hard work stupid

743
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,300
and that really what you want to do is
find something you love and then

744
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:14,090
disciplines no longer required because
you're truly enjoy it.

745
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,430
Which is sort of true.
But sort of not,

746
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,460
because if you really want to achieve
excellence,

747
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,980
you need both.
You need to find something you really

748
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:24,650
love doing and then you need to figure
out how to discipline yourself to pursue

749
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:29,600
it to the utmost so that you,
you hone that blade and sharpen it to

750
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:32,780
it's razor edge.
And if you do not do that,

751
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,340
then you're always going to have this
thing like,

752
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:36,380
oh man,
I could have been better.

753
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,580
We need resistance.

754
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,500
You know,
we need resistance in our life.

755
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,040
Like the obstacle is,
is what we should go towards.

756
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,020
No matter what that is,
whether we're writing,

757
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,300
you know,
writing itself contains its own

758
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:51,420
resistance points where it's hard and
you're pushing against that.

759
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:53,640
Obviously in weight training or
athletics,

760
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:56,760
it becomes really obvious what that
resistance point is.

761
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,920
You know,
you're actually moving weight or trying

762
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:02,610
to defeat a person.
But no matter what that is like applying

763
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:05,220
our force,
the force that is the totality of

764
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:08,940
ourselves against a resisting force and
overcoming.

765
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:12,210
I think that's a fundamental craving of
the human nature.

766
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,580
Like that is definitely a key to
happiness.

767
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:17,220
Whether it's against nature,
against yourself,

768
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:19,170
against a craft,
against another opponent,

769
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:22,260
against whatever else.
Like that dynamic,

770
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:25,230
that push poll is super key.
Yeah,

771
00:36:25,231 --> 00:36:29,250
it really is.
And I think unfortunately for whatever

772
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:31,620
reason,
when I,

773
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,680
at least when I look at life itself,
I almost think that the evil of the,

774
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,750
it seems like this,
the struggle of the world,

775
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,900
whether it's a struggle for peace,
whether it's a struggle for,

776
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,640
you know,
to alleviate people that are trapped in

777
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,840
poverty,
whatever,

778
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,640
whatever struggle there is.

779
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,520
It seems like those struggles are
almost,

780
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,890
it's almost imperative to have some sort
of a struggle in order for people to

781
00:36:58,891 --> 00:37:03,891
find balance and,
and to find inspiration to do better and

782
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,970
inspiration to,
to push further.

783
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:10,320
Like I wonder where society would be.
This is kind of sound fucked up,

784
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:15,321
but where would we be as a culture if it
wasn't for the horrors of war and crime?

785
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,410
Like where would we be?
I got,

786
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,450
as I was driving here today,
I was thinking about,

787
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:22,460
um,
um,

788
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:28,100
just how fortunate people are in the
United States in general are most people

789
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:31,200
are at least,
but that there's parts of the world

790
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:36,201
right now that are in these horrific,
almost mad max states like Liberia.

791
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,100
I've watched this one documentary on a
vice on Liberia that back in the day

792
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,910
that just cemented in my mind how
fortunate we are because mad max like

793
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,540
the apocalypse,
it exists,

794
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,360
it happens every day.

795
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,530
Just doesn't happen right here.
Knowing that that exists,

796
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,680
does that make you appreciate this more?
And if,

797
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,670
if that didn't exist,
would we,

798
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:07,350
would we try as hard as we do to try to
keep peace in the world?

799
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,530
Would we try as hard as we do to like
try to be happy and achieve happiness if

800
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:18,090
we didn't know that there was some
ultimate horrible sadness and evil shit

801
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:20,160
going on?
Would you appreciate the cool people in

802
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:24,510
your life if you didn't know that there
was just an army of content out there?

803
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,960
You know?
Yeah.

804
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,280
That's an interesting topic.
I kind of tend to believe that there's

805
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:33,450
enough internal resistance that will
battle enough of our own demons.

806
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:36,370
I mean look at how you celebrities

807
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,160
and really wealthy people,
their rate of happiness is no better

808
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:43,090
than anybody else because even when you
alleviate all of these conditions,

809
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,650
you're battling these internal demons,
like will always find resistance points.

810
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:51,250
So I think we would be okay because it's
just the way the system is built,

811
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:54,610
they would come up internally when
everything is right and then we have to

812
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:59,410
apply that same force to fight that
enemy within our own demons within

813
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,050
rather than having this clear objective
outside.

814
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,690
But it's,
it's almost easier and it's almost like

815
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,840
it has a certain allure to make an enemy
external.

816
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,520
Because then like imagine,
you know,

817
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:12,460
think back to when the twin towers got
bombed.

818
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,830
Everybody pulled together with this
common enemy.

819
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:16,320
We all had a mission,
you know,

820
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:20,170
and everything made sense and that was a
really good external,

821
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,840
you know,
external way to focus our mission.

822
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,890
But when it gets internal,
that's where we just don't have as many

823
00:39:26,891 --> 00:39:28,930
skills.
And that's where the tools,

824
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:32,230
like the plant medicines and like
meditation and like floating or the

825
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:35,020
tools you need to navigate and kind of
conquer those waters.

826
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:37,480
It's not guns and it's not bombs
anymore,

827
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:42,481
it's these other more subtle mechanisms
which were not nearly as advanced as we

828
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:46,390
are with the stuff that blows stuff up.
So I think it would just go from these

829
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:49,000
external battles which have always had
this great allure.

830
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,810
Let's go to war,
you know,

831
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,730
into these internal battles,
which are really actually a lot of times

832
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,170
even harder.
I mean,

833
00:39:56,171 --> 00:40:00,010
not to say that these conditions in war
aren't incredibly challenging and

834
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:01,750
incredibly difficult.
I mean,

835
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:05,590
I've heard stories from Tim Kennedy and
all kinds of soldiers and just blow your

836
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,410
mind,
but these internal battles can be super

837
00:40:08,411 --> 00:40:09,460
fucking intense too.

838
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,880
Yeah.
We just don't think of it as being

839
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,970
intense because there's no life or death
consequences.

840
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,960
The consequences are there are
psychological there.

841
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,340
The reality of who you are as opposed to
this image that you're projecting,

842
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:27,370
the reality to seeing all the sort of
failures and,

843
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,080
and all the different,
um,

844
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,750
um,
sort of mechanisms that you've created

845
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:37,280
in your mind,
in your,

846
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:42,080
in your life to deal with all these
personality issues that you might not

847
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:45,260
have ever addressed.
And then when you take a psychedelic and

848
00:40:45,261 --> 00:40:48,170
you're confronted by this,
like Ari was telling me about one of his

849
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:51,620
friends that was a dick and they took
him out to,

850
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:52,010
well,
you know,

851
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,090
already does that true and fest every
year it took him out to the desert and

852
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,470
he just had this literal come to Jesus
moment where it was like,

853
00:41:00,471 --> 00:41:01,730
why do I act like that?

854
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:03,140
Like,
what is wrong with me?

855
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:03,860
Like,
what,

856
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,430
what is the.
And then he realized he's just unhappy

857
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,330
with his life in his state.
Wake up where he is as far as his

858
00:41:11,331 --> 00:41:14,840
achievements as a standup comedian.
And as a,

859
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,230
you know,
like he's not successful.

860
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:17,460
At least he,
you know,

861
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:19,940
he's always struggling with his bills.
And because of that,

862
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,730
um,
he's nervous all the time.

863
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,510
So when he goes on stage,
he doesn't do well and because he's not

864
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:28,970
happy,
he doesn't have good relationships and

865
00:41:28,971 --> 00:41:30,500
because he doesn't have good
relationships,

866
00:41:30,501 --> 00:41:33,620
he doesn't feel good about himself
because other people don't feel good him

867
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:38,810
and he acts out almost in a defensive
mechanism like attacks people and acts

868
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,870
Shitty to people in almost a way of sort
of taking away focus from his own

869
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:49,970
failures,
his own internal disputes.

870
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,290
So he's sort of externalize those in
this weird way and become this

871
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,240
aggressive kind of shitty person.

872
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,480
Like here's a perfect example of that in
my opinion,

873
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,940
in a successful person,
Donald Trump,

874
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:03,860
right?
I mean,

875
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,220
why is that guy so shitty about
Mexicans?

876
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:09,590
Why doesn't he have a balanced nuance
perspective?

877
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:12,410
Why doesn't he understand that you were
insanely lucky?

878
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:16,700
You Fuck your dad gave you what,
2 million bucks to start a business and

879
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:16,921
you,
you,

880
00:42:16,921 --> 00:42:20,630
you make it seem like it's no big deal
that your dad loaned you all this money

881
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:22,490
and you're a self made man.
That's ridiculous.

882
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,830
First of all,
you live in America and you're white.

883
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,330
Okay?
Right away,

884
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,840
you're lucky as fuck.
And then you're involved in this system

885
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:33,830
that it's allowed you to fail and go
bankrupt and you know,

886
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:36,410
and skirt away from all your bills then
come back.

887
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:41,620
But the idea being that here's the guy
that has this insanely successful life

888
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:44,960
monetarily,
but yet still,

889
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:48,410
you know,
we'll have these ridiculous short,

890
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,540
shortsighted opinions that he rants and
about and talks about and these,

891
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,790
like these Syrian refugees and he's
like,

892
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:57,650
you know,
we need to keep out of the country,

893
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:00,370
keep keep Muslims out of the country.
We need to figure out what the hell's

894
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,190
going on,
like,

895
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,290
what the hell is going on?
Like what you're again,

896
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:06,920
you're not dealing with units,
you're dealing with massive amounts of

897
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:09,350
human beings that are all different and
varied.

898
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:13,430
Like why does he have this sort of
aggressive fuck you,

899
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:14,990
you're a loser approach.
What,

900
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,910
what is the conflict?
How does,

901
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:21,830
how does he get out of that and have a
more balanced perspective to deal with

902
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,660
what is really in a lot of people's
eyes,

903
00:43:23,661 --> 00:43:26,450
people that are way more unfortunate
than he is.

904
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:27,990
Yeah.
And you know,

905
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:32,190
there's a bias in society to just
appreciate these external success is,

906
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:33,190
oh,
you're wealthy,

907
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,410
Oh,
you've accomplished this.

908
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,650
But we undervalue those in the victories
over that internal self to get somebody

909
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:42,900
more conscious,
get somebody more open in their heart,

910
00:43:42,901 --> 00:43:47,100
like those are like shoved to the side.
So everybody's been kissing trump's ass

911
00:43:47,101 --> 00:43:49,650
because of the power that this money
creates in the power of that.

912
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,890
And we may even vote him in as president
in this crazy,

913
00:43:52,891 --> 00:43:57,390
crazy world even though he's completely
ignored probably the most important

914
00:43:57,391 --> 00:44:00,600
thing that any human could do,
which is go inside and have that

915
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:03,000
accurate self reflection like,
hey,

916
00:44:03,001 --> 00:44:06,210
am I a Douche bag right now?
And one of the best ways to do that is

917
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:10,110
with the plants or with meditation or
anywhere where you get still and allow

918
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:14,160
that force of consciousness to actually
take control of the helm of the mind.

919
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:16,620
Push the ego aside and show you the
truth.

920
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,240
But that's why people are terrified of
it.

921
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,300
That's why trump will never,
you know,

922
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,530
go do Iowaska and the jungle and I'll
never.

923
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,020
Maybe you will.
Maybe he would be amazing.

924
00:44:25,021 --> 00:44:26,440
If you want to.
Man,

925
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,310
I'll hook it up.
I will hook you up.

926
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:30,870
We'll go down.
It'll be.

927
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,520
Could you imagine

928
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,500
if like in mid cycle he just completely
shifted gears and said,

929
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,560
I had a moment.
I had a revelation and I realized that

930
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,950
what were the direction we're going in?
It's just not right.

931
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,150
Everybody be like,
wait,

932
00:44:48,151 --> 00:44:50,880
you are our only hope.
You're Obi wan Kenobi.

933
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:53,700
Motherfucker year.
You're Obi wan Kenobi for white people.

934
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,710
Like,
who else is there?

935
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,660
Hillary Clinton,
get the fuck out of here.

936
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,510
There's so many guys that are just not
going to vote for a woman.

937
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,280
Especially a woman who was married to
Bill Clinton,

938
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:04,410
who looks like a shrew.
It's just not happening.

939
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:04,981
Oh,
who else?

940
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:07,230
Bernie Sanders.
Get the fuck out of here.

941
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,540
There's so many people that are not
going to vote for Bernie Sanders.

942
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,580
Especially when you realize that he
wants to literally literally 90 percent.

943
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,850
He wants to tax rich people.
Ninety percent like this.

944
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,830
I thought that was bullshit.
I thought like,

945
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:20,970
well,
that's not true.

946
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,340
He didn't really say that.
That's probably an exaggeration.

947
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:24,180
Nope.
Nope.

948
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,490
He's actually said that and he goes back
to like,

949
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,220
I think it was Roosevelt,
I forgot who it was.

950
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,490
It was an office during the war and
there was at one point in time where

951
00:45:32,491 --> 00:45:37,491
they sort of effectively taxed rich
people at extremely high rates and you

952
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:39,120
know,
he was talking about the efficiency of

953
00:45:39,121 --> 00:45:42,090
that,
but the idea of taking money from

954
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:46,560
successful people and just such an
insane disproportionate amount and then

955
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:49,980
giving it to what the government,
who is the government,

956
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,900
the biggest waster of money to you,
you fuck like lifelong politicians and

957
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:59,901
people that are for whatever reason,
working government jobs like get outta

958
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:02,370
here.
You can't just take the money from

959
00:46:02,371 --> 00:46:04,890
people that have achieved that,
but that's not the solution and it's an

960
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:07,860
ineffective strategy because you can
only tax people on their income.

961
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,660
You can't tax them on their wealth.
Right?

962
00:46:09,661 --> 00:46:13,170
It's all income tax based.
So all of the wealth that's already been

963
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,250
accumulated by all of these people,
you know,

964
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:18,480
you can't even get that money anyway.
So you're just taxing the people who

965
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,690
finally are getting successful enough to
make the money as well as some of the

966
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:24,960
people who have residual money,
but it's not going to even achieve

967
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,450
practically pragmatically what he's
trying to do.

968
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,720
He's trying to be Robin Hood,
except he's only taking the new money.

969
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,150
Not the.
Not The existing 90 percent of the

970
00:46:33,151 --> 00:46:35,070
wealth that's all stored up.
It's just a crazy.

971
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,200
It's just crazy all around.
But the,

972
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,520
the unfortunate part is his ideas on
pretty much everything else are pretty

973
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:42,600
fucking cool.
Yeah.

974
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,760
You know,
so it's like he has this dichotomy and

975
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:48,330
that's these choices that we get stuck
with your alright,

976
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,320
pretty good over here.

977
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,700
But you're totally completely
incompetent in this one area.

978
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,620
You know,
it's this weird thing,

979
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:57,300
these weird choices that we have to
make.

980
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,980
Well,
I don't think we get anything other than

981
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,320
that.
When it comes to established people

982
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:03,540
running for president of United States
of America,

983
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:05,280
I think in order to get to that
position,

984
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,790
you have to be so compromised.
You have to be so deeply entrenched in

985
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:12,750
this insanely flawed system that someone
who was really radically outside of it

986
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,040
is looking at it and saying,
Hey,

987
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,850
this whole idea is ridiculous.
Having one person running the whole

988
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:20,640
thing is preposterous.
It doesn't make any sense.

989
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:24,000
It might work if there was 50 of us and
even if there was 50 of us,

990
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,230
there'd be like 20 people that don't
like how it's running and but the idea

991
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:31,060
to do it with three plus million people,
it's insane.

992
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:31,720
It's insane.

993
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,390
It's insane to have this one guy and
then we watched.

994
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,180
First of all,
Bernie Sanders looks like he's a

995
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,250
thousand years old now.
What the fuck is he going to look like

996
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:41,380
after four years in office?
I mean,

997
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:44,560
that guy is going to be dead.
Obama looks like dog shit.

998
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,880
I mean he looks old as fuck right now.
If you compare him to what he looked

999
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:52,240
like seven years ago,
that is not seven years of aging at some

1000
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:57,290
radically accelerated aging due to
stress and tension and the reality of

1001
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:01,240
the world itself,
the massive grain of his hair.

1002
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,510
He just looks tired all the time.
He looks like a different person.

1003
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:09,511
It looks much more frail,
mean he's experiencing some insane

1004
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,840
stress and part of that stress is a job
that you're not supposed to do.

1005
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:17,320
No one's supposed to have that job.
You're not so opposed to have the weight

1006
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:18,154
of the world.

1007
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,500
You have to sleep in this fucking house
in the park.

1008
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:24,790
And if people around you constantly
earpieces and guns and bulletproof cars,

1009
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,390
look at the difference.
Yeah,

1010
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,740
it's brutal.
The fucking difference.

1011
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:34,720
We're looking at a photo right now of
Obama from 2009 and Obama from 2014 and

1012
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,680
all my God,
I mean he looks like he's 20 years old

1013
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:43,681
plus 20 years older plus and,
and really the tools to help people cope

1014
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:48,781
with that kind of stress or just tools
that aren't really that prevalent and

1015
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:52,390
talked about like what,
what is he doing to help mitigate that,

1016
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,224
you know,
is he,

1017
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,270
is he going in the float tank,
you know,

1018
00:48:55,271 --> 00:48:59,440
is he doing these different things that
you have to do to be able to release

1019
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,780
some of that stress and be supported
properly?

1020
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,150
Definitely not.
This one's fucked,

1021
00:49:04,151 --> 00:49:05,710
man.
This photo is fucked.

1022
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:08,830
We're looking at him from 2008 and 2013.

1023
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,980
Oh my God.
The poor bastard.

1024
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:17,920
Wouldn't you love to just have that guy
to sit down with them and go,

1025
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:22,210
tell me what is really going on.
Just tell me,

1026
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,880
what is it like when you get in that
fucking office?

1027
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:27,520
Uh,
who are you talking to from Halliburton?

1028
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,590
Who,
what,

1029
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:33,590
what dude pops out of a fucking a metal
grate in the ground with steam and fire

1030
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,890
and presents to you,
you know,

1031
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:41,900
he like he hands you want to pitch fork
of manifesto of ideas that,

1032
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,610
you know,
this military industrial complex wants

1033
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:50,611
you to promote any kind of leadership
position is really crazy.

1034
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,050
I think if I was thinking about it
recently in war,

1035
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,960
like you know,
you applaud these generals for these

1036
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:57,420
great strategies,
you know,

1037
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:59,620
and,
and sometimes the strategy is you put a

1038
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:04,180
small number of troops in one area to
lead the main core of your enemy army

1039
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:07,420
toward those troops so that you can
trick them and attack their flank or

1040
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:07,990
something like that.

1041
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,330
Classic,
like General Strategy.

1042
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,000
But really what you're saying is,
all right,

1043
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,610
these hundred people,
they're gonna die for sure.

1044
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,130
Like they're gonna die for sure.
So who's up?

1045
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,120
Who's up for that one?
Okay,

1046
00:50:19,121 --> 00:50:22,600
you guys,
you go into die for sure category and

1047
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:25,300
then the rest of the army will come and
we'll kick some ass.

1048
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,580
Like what a fucked up that is.
You know,

1049
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:31,910
like knowingly saying that you have no
chance.

1050
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:35,360
Like there's no fight.
There's no like you can run away through

1051
00:50:35,361 --> 00:50:37,190
the back hills,
you're going to fucking die.

1052
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,580
That's the plan.
So that we can kick more ass over here.

1053
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:45,050
I mean you have to be something of a
sociopath to be able to pull that off.

1054
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,520
But again,
that's.

1055
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:51,140
You know what these great general,
these quote unquote great generals have

1056
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:55,220
all had to do is just make these crazy
decisions and being president is a

1057
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:56,390
little bit a part of that too.

1058
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:01,390
You have so many people that they become
like numbers and it's no longer just

1059
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:04,940
each individual like,
how's this going to affect this dude?

1060
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,310
This dude who is me living a different
life.

1061
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:10,310
How's it gonna Affect that dude?
And you can't think about like that

1062
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:12,410
because you go crazy if we're going to
do it.

1063
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:17,330
It's just a weird dynamic,
which we're not really prepared for.

1064
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,280
You know,
we're prepared for these kinds of tribal

1065
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:20,780
dynamics where,
you know,

1066
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:22,760
we're working,
we know everybody that we're leading.

1067
00:51:22,761 --> 00:51:25,940
There's the chief of the tribe,
maybe it's under 150 people.

1068
00:51:25,941 --> 00:51:27,980
If you look through anthropological
records,

1069
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:30,230
that's usually how it was.
And that's generally,

1070
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,420
you know,
the leader back in the kind of tribal

1071
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:35,660
organization.
But then as it gets massive shit gets

1072
00:51:35,661 --> 00:51:36,800
crazy.
Yeah.

1073
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:41,850
I think in war there's the ethos of the
warrior and the warrior ethos is it's a

1074
00:51:42,681 --> 00:51:47,150
different reality and I think for a lot
of those guys not talk to this one dude

1075
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,210
who's a navy seal and he was explaining
that the way a lot of guys look at it

1076
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:57,020
and him included was that if he died in
combat,

1077
00:51:57,021 --> 00:51:59,810
that he would die as a warrior and that
that would,

1078
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:04,820
if he was killed by another warrior,
that is a time honored way to go and

1079
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,170
that this is just the way.

1080
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,100
And this is the ways pursuing that he's
accepted that way and because he's

1081
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:13,820
accepted that way and all of the
exciting aspects of it,

1082
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,900
like one of the things you talked to
people that have been to war about it,

1083
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,630
like Jocko says,
it was the greatest time of his life.

1084
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,860
You're not supposed to say that,
but I'm glad he does.

1085
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:28,100
I'm glad he's honest about it because
when someone's honest about it,

1086
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,340
folks like you and I that are outside of
it,

1087
00:52:31,341 --> 00:52:32,120
they go,
oh,

1088
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,550
okay.
Well how do I fucking internalize this?

1089
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:37,010
How do I.
How do I absorb this information and

1090
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,490
bounce it around in my head and make it
have it make sense to me?

1091
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,800
But he's being honest.
He's saying,

1092
00:52:42,801 --> 00:52:44,600
look,
this is the life I chose.

1093
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:48,230
This is the path I wanted.
I'm there and I'm very excited and happy

1094
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:48,980
to be there.

1095
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,160
I'm happy to lead and I'm happy to be a
warrior.

1096
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,000
So if you're going to die,
you know you live,

1097
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:58,160
you die.
Is he wrong?

1098
00:52:58,161 --> 00:52:59,270
No,
it's just,

1099
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,070
we,
we,

1100
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:04,910
we have this idea that the way we're
living is the only way to live and that

1101
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,320
this is the wrong way to live,
but if you want to fucking make Omelets,

1102
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,990
you gotta crack eggs,
you want to get into Ramadi,

1103
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,700
he gonna have to shoot some bitches.
Yeah,

1104
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,770
there's just no way around it.
And then to have that accomplished.

1105
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,870
I mean,
I think we could all agree that there's

1106
00:53:20,871 --> 00:53:23,270
some bad people in the world in order
to,

1107
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:26,250
to somehow or another keep those bad
from going straight up.

1108
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:29,040
Hitler on us.
There's some ass kicking has to be done

1109
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,010
in the current state of humanity the way
it is right now.

1110
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,140
Unless we,
uh,

1111
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,760
utilize my method from shining happy
jihad.

1112
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,240
My 2006 CD where I say we use crop
duster planes,

1113
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,830
fucking cover the entire Middle East
with chronic smoke for a couple months.

1114
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,400
And even that might not work to do as a
sober up and go back to the old ways.

1115
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,030
Unless something radical happens,
it changes humanity.

1116
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,870
We're always going to have this struggle
between quote unquote good and evil.

1117
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,220
And when you have evil you need,
you need ass kickers.

1118
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,840
Yeah.
If you don't have ass kickers,

1119
00:54:00,841 --> 00:54:03,930
you got a real fucking problem.
So you need people that have this

1120
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,350
warrior ethos,
this mentality to go in there and get

1121
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:10,710
the job done.
And sometimes that means you have to

1122
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,200
sacrifice troops or you have to put them
in danger.

1123
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,710
You have to.
You have to understand that there's

1124
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,570
going to be risks and those risks are
going to be horrific.

1125
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,270
The results of those risks are
potentially horrific.

1126
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,430
Yeah.
And that's absolutely what you have to

1127
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:24,900
do.
It's actually something that the body

1128
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:26,450
does really well.
You know,

1129
00:54:26,451 --> 00:54:28,620
if you think of all the cells,
like many organisms,

1130
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:31,170
think about what happens when you go
into a Cryo tank.

1131
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,710
You know when you go into a Cryo tank,
all of the blood rushes to the core of

1132
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:36,810
your body to protect the most vital
parts.

1133
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,920
You know,
your organs,

1134
00:54:37,921 --> 00:54:41,490
the things that you need for the whole
organism to survive the blood leaves the

1135
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,260
extremities,
like the fingers and the toes.

1136
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:44,280
It's like,
fuck it,

1137
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:44,980
sorry,
fingers,

1138
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:45,640
toes.
Yeah,

1139
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,890
you gotta go,
but you're on your own,

1140
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,080
like if you die you die.
We're going to live,

1141
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:49,980
you know,
by doing that.

1142
00:54:49,981 --> 00:54:52,650
And that's kind of the way that these
armies have to go.

1143
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:55,110
So there is certainly a model,
it's just,

1144
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:59,910
I would hate to be that person that
looks out at some garrison of 100 people

1145
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:02,730
and being like,
you're going in this basically suicide

1146
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:04,230
mission,
so the rest of us can do.

1147
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,600
It's a brutal thing to do.
But again,

1148
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,010
the warrior ethos,
you know,

1149
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:09,780
these people would go,
you know,

1150
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:11,340
look at you and probably go,
Whoa,

1151
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,860
you know,
like,

1152
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,920
this is it,
this is what we're committed to,

1153
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:16,470
the mission,
the mission is greater even than our

1154
00:55:16,471 --> 00:55:17,550
lives,
you know?

1155
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,700
Yeah.
And there's a lot of people that look at

1156
00:55:20,701 --> 00:55:23,790
the way the world works and as far as
conflict and say,

1157
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,250
well,
the only reason why we're involved in

1158
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:29,580
these conflicts is because United States
is invaded all these countries and

1159
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:33,360
they've done this and the foreign policy
and it's caused this and that.

1160
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:36,480
And there's probably a lot of truth to
that.

1161
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,750
There's probably a lot of truth to that,
but at the end of the day,

1162
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:44,780
there has always in less,
the entire world is brought to the exact

1163
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:50,331
same standards as far as standards of
living as far as access to resources as

1164
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:52,830
far as just peace on earth.

1165
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,770
If the entire world is not up to the
same standards,

1166
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,930
you always going to have conflict and
you're always gonna.

1167
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,360
Have ambitious people.
He always gonna have those pollutants

1168
00:56:00,361 --> 00:56:02,220
out there.
You always going to have these dudes

1169
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:06,630
that just decide to just dominate a
country that's smaller than them or take

1170
00:56:06,631 --> 00:56:09,930
over an area of the world and then
you're going to have horrific human

1171
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:11,910
rights violations and then you have to
make choices.

1172
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:16,380
Do we allow this country that's doing
this to this smaller country and

1173
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:20,310
subjugating it's people and torturing
the women and won't let girls go to

1174
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:24,190
school and do we allow that to happen?
Or we decide that we're the police

1175
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:29,190
force of the world and it's a.
it's a complicated question because when

1176
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:32,800
you don't do anything,
then evil grows and then it becomes

1177
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:36,760
really powerful and then you get to a
Hitler type situation that can happen.

1178
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:37,601
People think,
well,

1179
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:39,490
that's not gonna happen today.
Jesus Christ.

1180
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,380
That was not long ago.
Sure.

1181
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:44,950
It doesn't seem like if you look at
those black and white night,

1182
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,820
fuck,
he's got his arm up in the air and

1183
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,070
fucking people screaming.
It seems like eons ago.

1184
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:52,360
Nope.
Nineteen forties,

1185
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,890
forties,
man.

1186
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,120
Love externalizing an enemy and you see
it now.

1187
00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:59,180
I mean,
it's actually starting to happen with

1188
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:00,710
all Muslims,
all Muslims.

1189
00:57:00,711 --> 00:57:05,711
For some people have become the enemy
because instead of it makes it really

1190
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:08,990
easy to define yourself against an
external force.

1191
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:12,020
Where as I was saying,
it's really difficult to actually go

1192
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:15,030
within and battle those internal forces
where you know,

1193
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:17,420
the real conflict is raging.
It's much easier to say,

1194
00:57:17,421 --> 00:57:19,130
oh yeah,
the fuck and Muslims.

1195
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:20,540
Yeah,
let's go get them.

1196
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:21,591
You know,
and that's,

1197
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:25,640
I think a tendency that we've,
all we've all had is just to go fight

1198
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:29,060
these external things in this crazy
video game we call life.

1199
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,190
You know,
we like the boss battles and we like

1200
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,550
that kind of,
that aspect of the game because it's

1201
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,800
very active.
It's very proactive.

1202
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:39,860
You're out there with your hands and
you're swinging and you're shooting and

1203
00:57:39,861 --> 00:57:40,694
you're doing things.

1204
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:44,930
Whereas like these,
exactly the internal battles,

1205
00:57:44,931 --> 00:57:46,880
you have to have a totally different
strategy.

1206
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:49,790
It's the strategy of actively
surrendering,

1207
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,020
like,
okay,

1208
00:57:51,021 --> 00:57:53,360
I got to let that go.
I got to let go of that attachment.

1209
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:56,060
I got to see myself and be okay with my
death.

1210
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:58,910
I got to.
It's like a completely reverse side of

1211
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:01,940
the coin where to make progress in that
it's surrender.

1212
00:58:01,941 --> 00:58:04,520
Whereas to make progress and more it's
vigor,

1213
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:05,780
you know,
it's like these,

1214
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:10,280
these two dichotomies and I think
ultimately the way the game is best

1215
00:58:10,281 --> 00:58:12,860
played because if you're playing on both
sides of the coin,

1216
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:16,550
you know you're playing externally with
vigor and you're playing internally with

1217
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:19,820
that surrender forest and advancing on
both sides.

1218
00:58:19,821 --> 00:58:20,630
And that's,
you know,

1219
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:24,080
that is the idea of the warrior poet.
That's the the warrior who can go

1220
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:28,700
externally like Musashi and kick some
ass and then go back to his dojo and

1221
00:58:28,701 --> 00:58:30,020
paint colors,
calligraphy,

1222
00:58:30,021 --> 00:58:34,070
and tap into his internal thoughts are
in meditation or are all of these

1223
00:58:34,071 --> 00:58:34,551
things.
I mean,

1224
00:58:34,551 --> 00:58:37,550
that's,
to me the ideal one is not better than

1225
00:58:37,551 --> 00:58:39,260
the other.
They're both important,

1226
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:42,650
you know,
just let's expand the opportunities that

1227
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:46,070
we have as humans to play both sides of
this amazing game and

1228
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,210
you know,
I think there's parallels to with what

1229
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:51,690
we're talking about about the body.
Then we want things to change quickly,

1230
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:53,730
but the body does not change quickly the
body.

1231
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:58,731
It's sort of a long,
slow process and I think that's what's

1232
00:58:59,521 --> 00:59:04,140
going on with society and civilization
itself,

1233
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,150
that there's this.
We would like,

1234
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,540
we want war to be over.
We want everybody to live at peace.

1235
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:14,720
We want everybody to have a livable wage
and you shouldn't live in poverty and we

1236
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,920
got too many.
There's wealth disparity.

1237
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,750
We're going to fix it all.
You know it,

1238
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:23,990
it doesn't necessarily work that way.
The debate is going to start changing

1239
00:59:25,041 --> 00:59:26,890
people's ideas,
people's ideas,

1240
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,640
going to change their behavior and their
actions,

1241
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,000
and then ultimately we would hope that
we'd get to a better place than we were

1242
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:37,001
today someday.
Just like if we look back at 1200 add

1243
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,790
and look at today,
I think we would all agree this is a way

1244
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:41,624
better place.

1245
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,663
Yeah,
yeah,

1246
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,240
for sure.
I mean the heart of the dark ages where

1247
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,180
it's actually literally dark outside,
but,

1248
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,230
but also just the practices were
completely fucked.

1249
00:59:51,231 --> 00:59:54,020
You know,
think of the inquisition that was,

1250
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,690
that was the most ridiculous thing in
history.

1251
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,600
You know,
all of these people burned at the stake

1252
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,470
for some weird idea that they were,
which witches aren't real?

1253
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:05,760
Well,
it sounds a lot like what's going the

1254
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,210
hysteria that's going on today about
Isis,

1255
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:13,770
these ideologies that manifests
themselves and become toxic to all those

1256
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:21,161
around them until people rally against
it or realized the folly of that way and

1257
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:23,750
then change.
They meet that resistance.

1258
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:28,990
They find this horrible thing in the
world and they resist it and they fight

1259
01:00:29,031 --> 01:00:33,500
against it and then things get better
and it's kind of like a constant cycle

1260
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:35,420
that's going on that we would like to
end.

1261
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:37,190
We were like,
we would like it to be over now,

1262
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:39,560
please.
We would like to not have conflict,

1263
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:41,360
but we've got a lot of problems.
First of all,

1264
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,560
we don't understand each other.
It's fucking what?

1265
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,860
How many different languages do you
know?

1266
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,260
How many languages are there?
I don't know what the fuck those people

1267
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:49,170
are saying.
I don't even know.

1268
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:52,430
I see.
I have some people that I follow on

1269
01:00:52,431 --> 01:00:54,710
twitter that are Russian,
like a Russian fighters,

1270
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,980
and they'll occasionally,
they'll tweet something with their crazy

1271
01:00:57,981 --> 01:01:01,480
Russian words.
Those Russian letters.

1272
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:04,310
That one looks like a tree house.
Looks like pants,

1273
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,760
pants,
treehouse.

1274
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:10,120
What are you trying to say?
What the fuck is that like?

1275
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:12,030
What is he saying?
Don't worry.

1276
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,300
Or Hebrew.
You know,

1277
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:15,770
you see people that write in Hebrew.
You're like,

1278
01:01:15,771 --> 01:01:17,210
okay,
what does that.

1279
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,390
What is this?
This even these aren't even letters or

1280
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:24,320
Chinese or Japanese or Korean or all
fucking Christ.

1281
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:29,570
We see we can't understand each other,
so it's the idea of all of us coming to

1282
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:35,981
these same conclusions and having these
same ideals when the world vary so

1283
01:01:36,771 --> 01:01:41,771
radically and drastically as far as
conditions and poverty and you know,

1284
01:01:41,811 --> 01:01:42,210
and,
and,

1285
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,470
and then you know,
places like North Korea that had just

1286
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:50,471
been under the boot of a dictator since
the jump and they're just stuck.

1287
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,820
They're stuck in this insanely shitty
spot.

1288
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,680
The idea that your life in Pasadena is
going to be the same as some guy who's

1289
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:00,410
stuck in North Korea who might,
you know,

1290
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:02,750
as mother and father might've grown up
in prison.

1291
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,090
I mean,
there's people that are born and raised

1292
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:06,430
in prison camps.
They're,

1293
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,800
the world's not even,
it's just,

1294
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:13,801
it's just not an until we get past all
of these conflicts that we see right

1295
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:16,220
now,
it's not going to be even.

1296
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,380
It's not going to simply the United
States just stops invading these

1297
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,790
countries.
Everything's going to be great.

1298
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,390
It's not,
it's not going to.

1299
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:24,930
It's now.
It's not going to fix North Korea,

1300
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,820
just not.
It's way more complicated and they don't

1301
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:32,760
know they've lived this way their entire
lives.

1302
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:35,460
Many of them don't even know how it's
going on,

1303
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,940
like what's going on in the rest of the
world and they're not.

1304
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,370
They're not going to change that
quickly.

1305
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,890
It's going to take a long ass time.
They might have to die off.

1306
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:47,010
That might be what's going on with
United States politics as well.

1307
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:52,350
When you're looking at what we're seeing
now with Hillary Clinton and Bernie

1308
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:56,730
Sanders and Donald Trump and ted Cruz.
Get the fuck out of here.

1309
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,370
When I'm,
when I'm looking at in my mind is like a

1310
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:02,730
dying campfire so he can kick around a
few embers.

1311
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,650
There's like a little something left
here,

1312
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:08,070
but it's eventually going to die off.
I mean,

1313
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:08,760
this is,
uh,

1314
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,040
these are this.
There's no teddy Roosevelt's.

1315
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,110
There's no JFK.
There's,

1316
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:15,710
there's no fucking real leaders that are
running okay.

1317
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:19,550
I think they'll only come when the
people demand that they come when the

1318
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,340
people demand that people have
consciousness or reading them.

1319
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:25,070
But now at this point we're too easily
distracted.

1320
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,350
You know,
were they found these little hooks,

1321
01:03:27,351 --> 01:03:31,790
these ways to tug and pull at our
emotions and our fears and our different

1322
01:03:31,791 --> 01:03:36,791
things that Kinda influence us into
following these different preset paths.

1323
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,400
It's like,
I know I'm not big into the whole

1324
01:03:40,401 --> 01:03:44,480
conspiracy of the whole thing,
but certainly it's very good marketing

1325
01:03:44,481 --> 01:03:49,190
propaganda to hook people into following
certain preset channels that keep the

1326
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:53,360
establishment where it is,
but eventually that will break and I do

1327
01:03:53,361 --> 01:03:57,800
think that's one of the reasons why
there has been some intentional

1328
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:02,450
oppression of these mind expanding
consciousness tools that are available

1329
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:07,451
to us because those tend to allow you to
see the see the machine behind the

1330
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:08,170
curtain.

1331
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,000
You know,
that lets you see Oz.

1332
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:10,940
You're like,
oh,

1333
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:14,470
I see you pulling that lever bitch.
Like I know I kind of want to know

1334
01:04:14,471 --> 01:04:17,150
what's going on.
And that's a dangerous thing when you

1335
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,520
have this big establishment that's built
on that.

1336
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:23,150
But I'm really optimistic.
I think that it's going to change

1337
01:04:23,151 --> 01:04:26,120
because of the Internet.
I think actually a lot of these things

1338
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:29,090
wouldn't have been allowed to get to
where they are if the Internet had

1339
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,660
already been around from the beginning
because whistleblowers have been coming

1340
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:35,420
out information would it spread,
but that same force,

1341
01:04:35,421 --> 01:04:37,550
that free spread of information is going
to start,

1342
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,490
you know,
taking away all of these different

1343
01:04:40,491 --> 01:04:44,720
shenanigans and all of these tricks that
people are going on right now.

1344
01:04:44,721 --> 01:04:47,270
We're just kind of tolerating them,
but eventually I'll.

1345
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,410
Tolerance will get less and less and I
think that will be an interesting and

1346
01:04:51,411 --> 01:04:52,040
exciting

1347
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:52,871
for sure.
Yeah,

1348
01:04:52,871 --> 01:04:55,630
I agree.
And I also think that when you look at

1349
01:04:55,870 --> 01:05:00,870
the way we conduct politics today,
the way how the debates,

1350
01:05:01,390 --> 01:05:04,150
they all stand in the most unnatural way
possible.

1351
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:07,660
You're at a podium,
which never happens in life.

1352
01:05:07,661 --> 01:05:10,180
When do you ever talk to a friend?
They stand in front of a podium.

1353
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:12,520
Can you imagine?
Like if your girlfriend said,

1354
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,950
hey rob,
come on over man,

1355
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:16,510
I'd really love to have a conversation
with you.

1356
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,220
And then behind a podium

1357
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,250
and she's like,
there's your podium and this is my

1358
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,970
friend margie and Margie is going to act
as our moderator and you're going to

1359
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:26,980
state your point and then I'm going to
state my point.

1360
01:05:26,981 --> 01:05:30,490
We're going to have an audience and the
audience is going to cheer or respond in

1361
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,830
turn.
Like why is there a fucking audience?

1362
01:05:32,831 --> 01:05:35,950
These debates,
why is there's this grand standing

1363
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:40,000
opportunity where you can say what the
United States people deserve.

1364
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:42,730
It's a fair wage.
What we deserve,

1365
01:05:42,731 --> 01:05:44,080
what we want,
what we want,

1366
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,090
equal rights,
what we want.

1367
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,730
Black lives matter.
And when you say all these things that

1368
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:50,840
make people yes,
yes,

1369
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,200
it's,
it's all orchestrated.

1370
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,050
It's all artificial and it's all.
It's.

1371
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:59,500
It's the least natural and normal way to
communicate possible.

1372
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,920
Normal,
natural way to communicate would be sit

1373
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:07,540
down and have a conversation with these
people and try to figure out what are

1374
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:09,190
your plans,
how are you going to do this?

1375
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:12,580
And then the,
the rest of the world that's watching

1376
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:15,040
this gets to decipher and try to figure
out,

1377
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,540
okay,
is this guy makes sense?

1378
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,880
Is he full of shit he nobody's talking
about.

1379
01:06:18,881 --> 01:06:21,100
Does he have the data that he says he
does?

1380
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:25,960
Does he have the possible resources to
fix these issues and does this plan

1381
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:27,760
makes sense fiscally?
Does it.

1382
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,750
Is there their numbers to actually pull
this off or is it bullshit,

1383
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,900
but you don't.
You don't get to that when you're.

1384
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:38,470
You're involved in this debate where
there's a guy standing there talking.

1385
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:41,260
There's a whole fucking crowd of people
behind him.

1386
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:42,970
Then these people that are on
spotlights,

1387
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:45,670
they're wearing makeup.
They have notes in front of them like,

1388
01:06:45,671 --> 01:06:47,620
what is this?
What is the end?

1389
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:51,040
Does that person have the character and
that character under pressure?

1390
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,640
You know,
that's one of the most important things.

1391
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:56,620
Like when there's forces of pressure,
are you going to crumble?

1392
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:58,970
Like even when I'm hiring,
you know,

1393
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,960
add on it in the company,
like one of the most important things is

1394
01:07:01,961 --> 01:07:03,220
all right,
do you have the skills,

1395
01:07:03,221 --> 01:07:04,840
like what exactly what you're talking
about?

1396
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:07,300
Have you done this before?
Are you capable of,

1397
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:09,190
you know,
being a chief technical officer,

1398
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,660
what's the code that you've written?
You know,

1399
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:12,940
how have you been able to handle these
situations,

1400
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:15,790
but then there's also like,
how are you going to handle pressure?

1401
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:16,960
You know,
for me,

1402
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:21,670
like that's a really important thing.
So I'll do things informally to kind of

1403
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,580
test people out.
Like we'll go do a workout if they're

1404
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:25,360
athletic,
you know,

1405
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:29,320
we'll go do a hard workout and just see
kind of how they handle that external

1406
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:33,310
pressure will go out and get really
drunk and go out drinking and see like,

1407
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,450
oh,
when you're drunk,

1408
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,590
like does some weird shit come up,
little demons that are hiding in there

1409
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:39,760
that we need to find out about.

1410
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,780
And so eventually then you get this
opportunity to see and sometimes I'm

1411
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,820
dead wrong,
I've been dead wrong before,

1412
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:48,580
but then at that point you have the
ability to just say,

1413
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,600
Oh man,
I was wrong.

1414
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,910
Sorry,
this isn't the right fit and you know,

1415
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,530
you're out.
But America doesn't have that

1416
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:55,240
opportunity.
Of course you could impeach somebody,

1417
01:07:55,241 --> 01:07:57,370
but that's this crazy process.
You know,

1418
01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:01,090
it's just this weird thing where you
have all of this false hype and

1419
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:03,640
propaganda.
Then they're there and then they're just

1420
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:06,820
there right now and it's like there's no
accountability at that point.

1421
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:08,740
You don't really know what's going on.
Well,

1422
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:12,460
Clinton was the last person to go
through an impeachment procedure,

1423
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,440
right?
I mean they essentially ever get that

1424
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:16,274
far.

1425
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:19,490
I don't know.
I don't know what will impeachment.

1426
01:08:19,491 --> 01:08:21,800
We think of impeachment is being removed
from office,

1427
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:27,020
but a peach meant impeachment
essentially is being forced to sit down

1428
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:30,290
and review whether or not you should be
removed from office.

1429
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,530
I think they actually get kicked out is
a different phrase,

1430
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:37,820
different term,
but he was and he was on the most

1431
01:08:37,821 --> 01:08:41,540
preposterous thing ever.
Getting head like it wasn't.

1432
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:44,450
It didn't have anything to do with how
he was running the country.

1433
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:49,480
It was him lying.
The way he described this encounter with

1434
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:55,130
this woman's mouth and his penis.
You know that it is.

1435
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:58,430
The way he understands that was not
sexual relations.

1436
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:01,890
Yeah.
What the definition of is is.

1437
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:04,220
Yeah.
It was a great line that he had there.

1438
01:09:04,550 --> 01:09:07,100
Do you remember that conversation where
they.

1439
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:12,120
They were grilling him and they were.
They were giving him this.

1440
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:18,850
They sat down with them and they were
forcing him to recount what happened and

1441
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:23,150
describe in his,
in his eyes why he felt like he wasn't

1442
01:09:23,151 --> 01:09:27,800
lying and he's like,
as as the way it was defined to me,

1443
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:33,370
I do not think that I had sex with that
person and it was this weird fucking

1444
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,590
dance they were doing where you're like,
what?

1445
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,880
What are we doing here?
Like it's supposed to be about intent.

1446
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:42,770
What is intent?
Like did anything,

1447
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,950
did anything happen with that check?
Like can,

1448
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:46,730
can you say that?
Did you guys hook up?

1449
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:48,680
You know,
that's where hookup is like well

1450
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:50,090
defined.
Hook up,

1451
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,290
hook up.
As far as it's been explained to me.

1452
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:57,260
I did not hook up with that woman.
And what is hookup?

1453
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:00,620
You got to ask fucker asked to.
Mouth counts

1454
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,570
just jerks you off of the Oval Office
desk.

1455
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,230
That's nothing.

1456
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:07,730
Nothing.
That's that.

1457
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:12,050
Who Care exactly does care.
That's the crazy.

1458
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:14,570
Well we care because we catch you,
we catch you.

1459
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,750
We catch you lying.
Like that's one of the unique things

1460
01:10:17,751 --> 01:10:21,350
about a guy like Charlie Sheen because
in a lot of ways charlie sheen really

1461
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:24,320
did sort of pull the curtain back on a
different machine,

1462
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,590
the machine of,
of,

1463
01:10:26,591 --> 01:10:31,591
of sort of what is it that people have a
real issue with when someone gets caught

1464
01:10:33,111 --> 01:10:37,280
doing something like whether it's
smoking crack like Charlie Sheen did or

1465
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:39,440
whether it's getting blown like Clinton
did.

1466
01:10:39,590 --> 01:10:41,510
What is it that we really have a problem
with?

1467
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,470
I think we really have a problem with
almost more than anything is dishonesty.

1468
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:50,600
And when he was onstage when Clinton.
Well it was a wherever he was,

1469
01:10:50,601 --> 01:10:53,870
where he's like,
I did not have sexual relations with

1470
01:10:53,871 --> 01:10:56,960
that woman.
When you see him say that and you know

1471
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:57,800
he got his dick suck.

1472
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,920
Do you like wait a minute.
Okay,

1473
01:11:01,070 --> 01:11:03,650
well what's going on here man?
Cause you,

1474
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:07,490
you're not being honest now and now
we're in a situation where I know that

1475
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:12,491
your horse shitting me and then okay.
And then they're going to tell you that

1476
01:11:12,620 --> 01:11:14,670
they caught you,
the girls got address.

1477
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:17,100
Got Your calm on it.
Well hold on now.

1478
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,020
I'm not a liar,
I just,

1479
01:11:19,021 --> 01:11:21,570
as it's been explained to me is how I
feel,

1480
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,160
and then you,
you deal with all this,

1481
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:24,990
you know,
this,

1482
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:27,450
ah,
that feeling like that.

1483
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,460
Whereas Charlie Sheen comes out and
goes,

1484
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:31,020
look,
I was smoking rocks,

1485
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,180
you know,
I'm a fucking winter.

1486
01:11:33,181 --> 01:11:34,680
I'm winning every day.
And I'm like,

1487
01:11:34,681 --> 01:11:35,910
all right,
you know,

1488
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:36,990
that's,
that's what I do.

1489
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:37,951
You know,
I,

1490
01:11:37,951 --> 01:11:40,080
I'm,
I'm banging hookers and smoking rocks.

1491
01:11:40,081 --> 01:11:42,710
You're like,
okay,

1492
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:45,450
I guess we're done.
They kid fucking say anything.

1493
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,490
What,
what are you going to say to a guy like

1494
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:47,670
that?

1495
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,790
Obviously he's not the president.
He's not running for president,

1496
01:11:49,810 --> 01:11:51,840
not in public office.
He's not a leader.

1497
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,660
He's just a guy.
But he's a guy that,

1498
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,150
you know,
was,

1499
01:11:56,460 --> 01:11:59,280
it is refreshing when you hear that.
I think that's what tiger woods should

1500
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:01,320
have done when all that shit came out
and he should just spend like,

1501
01:12:01,321 --> 01:12:03,360
look,
I'm fucking tiger woods.

1502
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,530
I'm horny.
Like,

1503
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:05,350
it's,
it's,

1504
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,510
it's me like deal with it,
you know,

1505
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:11,910
instead of being a hard sell to go to
rehab and do these different things like

1506
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,710
sex rehab,
like I could,

1507
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:17,370
I could imagine that there might be some
value in that for somebody,

1508
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:21,720
but I really think that's just a way for
people to retreat because of these crazy

1509
01:12:21,721 --> 01:12:25,140
societal norms that say we shouldn't
want to bang people.

1510
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:26,790
You know,
it's like this is like the,

1511
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:30,540
the approved bullshit fallback position
that all of us know is bullshit,

1512
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:33,500
but you have to go play this charade,
you know,

1513
01:12:33,510 --> 01:12:34,350
and figure it out.

1514
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,530
It's just,
I think we got to all start respecting

1515
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:41,820
like the truth about each other.
Like everybody likes to have sex.

1516
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,700
Like let's just fucking get over it,
deal with it.

1517
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:46,770
Like it's cool.
Not only that,

1518
01:12:46,771 --> 01:12:49,140
but the per,
the type of people that wind up being

1519
01:12:49,141 --> 01:12:51,190
president,
the you,

1520
01:12:51,191 --> 01:12:56,191
you have to be some insanely confident
achiever and those people generally

1521
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:01,410
genuinely are generally both like to
fuck,

1522
01:13:02,160 --> 01:13:04,800
you know.
And that's what the whole jfk thing was

1523
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:07,080
all about.
Jfk was apparently like the biggest

1524
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:10,930
freak of all times.
And when people who knew him,

1525
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,620
when they see how much of these stories
are true,

1526
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,300
it's up to,
you know,

1527
01:13:15,301 --> 01:13:16,830
who knows,
we really don't know.

1528
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:20,850
But what you hear is the ultimate super
freak.

1529
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:25,950
I mean he was just in this time where
the information didn't spread very

1530
01:13:25,951 --> 01:13:28,260
quick.
I mean we're just getting it now.

1531
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:32,550
18 when she was in the White House and
he made her blow his friends and stuff

1532
01:13:32,551 --> 01:13:33,840
like that.
It was like really freaky.

1533
01:13:33,841 --> 01:13:36,720
Like in a pool.
I keep the woman that had an affair with

1534
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:38,130
him.
I think she was like,

1535
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:44,050
he had her suck some guy's Dick who was
secretary of state or something like

1536
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:48,030
that in front of him in a swimming pool.
And she wrote this book like,

1537
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,270
like a couple of years ago and it came
out like.

1538
01:13:51,271 --> 01:13:53,490
Or these stories were published a couple
of years ago.

1539
01:13:53,491 --> 01:13:56,610
It's like,
it takes so long for that information to

1540
01:13:56,611 --> 01:13:59,580
come out.
But if Clinton was in office right now,

1541
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:02,040
like queued Lord.
Yeah,

1542
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,130
good Lord.
What stories would come out like,

1543
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:05,940
whoa,
crazy.

1544
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,510
But if JFK was in office,
he would make Clinton look like a

1545
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,770
fucking in in our eyes because

1546
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,620
the data didn't get out while he was
alive.

1547
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,260
He's a great man and that's how we look
at it.

1548
01:14:17,261 --> 01:14:18,430
We look at it.
He's a great man.

1549
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,760
That was a,
a huge champion for civil rights and he

1550
01:14:22,761 --> 01:14:27,520
was gunned down by a horrible person who
is probably working for the CIA during

1551
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:29,110
his prime.
Then.

1552
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:31,750
I mean,
what about Putin?

1553
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,710
He's got it locked down,
don't Russia.

1554
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:38,230
And nobody's fucking with him in the
system.

1555
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:39,760
I mean,
he's murdering people,

1556
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:41,740
allegedly.
Supposedly.

1557
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

1558
01:14:43,271 --> 01:14:44,440
It's a,
it's a weird.

1559
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,590
It's a weird thing now where,
you know,

1560
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:48,820
there's such a spotlight on the wrong
shit.

1561
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,390
You know,
we get so easily distracted by these,

1562
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:54,740
these things that really don't matter,
you know,

1563
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,680
because we've set up this false
paradigm.

1564
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:01,300
People aren't supposed to have sex and
people able to have the most sex in the

1565
01:15:01,301 --> 01:15:02,980
world.
The most powerful people,

1566
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:07,180
athletes and presidents are supposed to
be faithful in this monogamous

1567
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:07,750
relationship.

1568
01:15:07,750 --> 01:15:10,750
And I think as we look forward into the
future,

1569
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:14,620
I think people are going to start to
understand each other a little bit

1570
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:17,830
better and some of these expectations
are just going to drop.

1571
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:21,700
I mean these were some old control
mechanisms put in by the church.

1572
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:25,120
Like you want someone to be relying on
the church.

1573
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:29,410
Well make them guilty for something that
they will always be guilty for,

1574
01:15:29,411 --> 01:15:31,690
something they cannot control,
sexual desires.

1575
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,260
Make them guilty for that and make you
the only person to have the cure.

1576
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:38,920
So create a problem that everybody's
going to have and have you be the cure

1577
01:15:38,921 --> 01:15:40,000
you.
You can only,

1578
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:42,490
you can absolve them of their sins,
you know,

1579
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:46,240
and it's this old control mechanism that
was put in place,

1580
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,000
you know,
maybe partly to keep the society and

1581
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:52,240
this kind of regimen in order,
but also to keep one particular

1582
01:15:52,241 --> 01:15:54,640
organization empower and isn't.

1583
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,530
It's sort of a byproduct of our lack of
ability to read each other's minds and

1584
01:15:59,531 --> 01:16:02,260
truly understand what each other are
thinking.

1585
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:06,220
Like this ability to find the truth and
actually get information.

1586
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:09,310
The ability to disguise that,
to disguise it.

1587
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:13,030
With this false morality and this Norman
Rockwell image that you're trying to

1588
01:16:13,031 --> 01:16:18,031
project all that leads to this like
massive confusion as to what the actual

1589
01:16:19,211 --> 01:16:24,211
playing field we're on really is,
and when we look at these media created

1590
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:28,990
versions of our world,
whether it's murder she wrote or CSI or

1591
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:34,170
a television show or a movie or a
coldplay song or some distorted version

1592
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:38,710
of human beings that we absorb into our
database.

1593
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:40,780
Well,
people are Clint Eastwood.

1594
01:16:40,810 --> 01:16:44,470
People are Charles Bronson know people
with a real clinics would the real

1595
01:16:44,471 --> 01:16:47,770
cleanness would as an old man who's been
divorced a shitload of times,

1596
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:50,200
who gets on stage and says a bunch of
Wacky Shit.

1597
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:52,510
We.
He pretends to have Obama sitting next

1598
01:16:52,511 --> 01:16:56,860
to him and it does this add.
It means he's doing a fucking ad libbed

1599
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:01,300
speech where he said he didn't even plan
that out.

1600
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:04,700
He just had obama like a fake Obama
sent.

1601
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:06,760
Do you remember that from the
Republican?

1602
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,320
Oh my God.
You never saw it?

1603
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:09,440
No.
You never saw it?

1604
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,010
No.

1605
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,030
Oh,
Jamie.

1606
01:17:11,031 --> 01:17:12,680
You must.
You must.

1607
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:14,240
You must.
It's.

1608
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,810
It's wonderful because this is the real
clinics with the real clinics would was

1609
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:21,140
the guy who was married to a woman who
made him do a reality show and I love

1610
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,220
cleaning,
don't get me wrong,

1611
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:27,290
I'm a fucking giant fan of his movies.
I'm a giant fan of the Spaghetti

1612
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:32,290
Westerns and the unforgiven and no,
but who he is as a man is just a.

1613
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:36,950
just an old man who's a republican and
he,

1614
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:41,980
because of the fact that he's famous,
they allowed him to go on stage at this

1615
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:47,590
convention or whatever the fuck it was
and give this insane speech where he had

1616
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:52,210
a chair next to him and he pretended it
was Obama and he actually like was

1617
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,280
standing over him looking down on them
like,

1618
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:56,660
watch this.
This is hilarious.

1619
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,010
You go to,
you're going to laugh your ass

1620
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:03,030
ministration hasn't done enough to cure
that and whatever.

1621
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:08,480
Whatever interests they have is not
strong enough and I think possibly now

1622
01:18:10,591 --> 01:18:14,370
it may be time for somebody else to come
along and solve the

1623
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,440
stand up white people.

1624
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,950
Mr. President,
how do you,

1625
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:36,210
how do you handle?
How do you handle promises that you've

1626
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:40,120
made when you were running for election
and how do you handle it?

1627
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:41,810
How do you handle it?
I mean,

1628
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,080
what do you say to people or do you
could just.

1629
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,630
I know people,
uh,

1630
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,470
people were wondering,
you don't.

1631
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:56,400
Well,
I know even some of the people in your

1632
01:18:56,401 --> 01:18:58,400
own party who were very disappointed and
we did,

1633
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:01,260
didn't close Gitmo and I thought,
well,

1634
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:03,900
I think get Kale closing Gitmo.
Why close that?

1635
01:19:03,901 --> 01:19:06,510
We spent so much money on it,
but

1636
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,480
I thought maybe it's an excuse.
What do you mean?

1637
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:15,920
Shut up?
Okay.

1638
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:18,730
It just,
I thought it was just because somebody

1639
01:19:18,731 --> 01:19:23,470
had this stupid idea of trying
terrorists and downtown New York City

1640
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:23,830
maybe.

1641
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:24,663
Yeah.

1642
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,360
If anybody wants

1643
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:32,660
us,
it's wonderful to watch because

1644
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,490
he's,
I'm sure a nice guy.

1645
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:38,440
I don't know.
I don't know.

1646
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,160
Cleaning doesn't seem to be a terrible
person,

1647
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:43,400
but just why close get my.
We spent so much money on it.

1648
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:46,330
Well,
why don't fucking keep the gas chambers

1649
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,500
open in Germany.
I'm sure they spent money on those two.

1650
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:52,430
What the fuck kind of argument is that
why close Gitmo?

1651
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:56,420
We spent so much money on it.
That is some wacky old man,

1652
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:58,310
republican thinking right there.
Sure.

1653
01:19:58,350 --> 01:19:59,183
The.
The idea that

1654
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:00,400
say that will,
what will,

1655
01:20:00,401 --> 01:20:01,234
what will.
Yes.

1656
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:04,030
We will work closer with George Martin

1657
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:07,290
glass.
Fuck he talking about.

1658
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,800
We're talking about a place where people
are pulled out of school where people

1659
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,760
might've went to the wrong meeting.
They might have known someone who knew

1660
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:19,200
somebody and they get locked up,
put in these orange jumpsuits and stuck

1661
01:20:19,201 --> 01:20:21,930
in these fucking camps for a decade.
Yeah.

1662
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:23,820
Maybe that's not a good idea to have
that.

1663
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,540
You know what works.
I think you brought up a good point when

1664
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,340
you said if people could read each
other's minds.

1665
01:20:31,341 --> 01:20:34,430
I think Bertrand Russell explored that,
the philosopher and he was saying that,

1666
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:36,680
you know,
initially it would just be whore.

1667
01:20:36,681 --> 01:20:38,630
Everybody would retreat to their homes
and be like,

1668
01:20:38,631 --> 01:20:40,220
man,
the world's fucking crazy.

1669
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:42,620
But eventually you just get kind of used
to it.

1670
01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:43,580
Yeah.
And then you'd be like,

1671
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,850
oh,
everybody has these same thoughts and

1672
01:20:46,851 --> 01:20:50,000
these same things that are going on in
their head and then everybody could

1673
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:53,300
actually start to track truth.
You know,

1674
01:20:53,301 --> 01:20:55,010
and just realize that,
oh,

1675
01:20:55,011 --> 01:20:58,400
everybody's thinking about pussy and or
Dick or whatever you're thinking about.

1676
01:20:58,401 --> 01:21:02,810
Everybody has these urges,
has these conflicting forces inside

1677
01:21:02,811 --> 01:21:05,720
their own heads.
Even weird thoughts,

1678
01:21:05,721 --> 01:21:07,520
weird thoughts when you're on this high
place,

1679
01:21:07,521 --> 01:21:08,980
that weird thought,
man,

1680
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:10,220
maybe I should just jump off.

1681
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,360
You know,
like what happened?

1682
01:21:11,361 --> 01:21:15,740
They're like these weird things that all
of us have that we shoved down deep in

1683
01:21:15,741 --> 01:21:17,270
some nook and be like,
that's not me.

1684
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:18,290
That's not me.
It's not me.

1685
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:21,890
You all have these fucked up things.
We all have that urge when we see a kid

1686
01:21:21,891 --> 01:21:25,340
making a beautiful sandcastle being man
and be funny to just knock that shit

1687
01:21:25,341 --> 01:21:27,350
over,
even though we'd never want to do it.

1688
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:29,690
Like we have these crazy parts of
ourselves.

1689
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:31,790
I think that's something that,
you know,

1690
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:35,660
as I've gotten this past year,
I did some pretty the most intense

1691
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:38,690
psychedelic journeys of my life,
which actually I've never talked to you

1692
01:21:38,691 --> 01:21:39,830
about.
Um,

1693
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:44,600
but part of it was just reconciling the
fact that we're a lot of things.

1694
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:48,020
We're not just the good thing that we,
that we think we are,

1695
01:21:48,021 --> 01:21:51,360
we're kind of everything.
We're all parts where all the good were

1696
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:53,990
all of the bad and we're just a
summation of our choices.

1697
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,450
You know,
it's really about like what we choose to

1698
01:21:56,451 --> 01:22:00,650
be and harnessing that,
that element of like I'm going to choose

1699
01:22:00,651 --> 01:22:04,010
to be someone who loves someone who's
someone who does good and brings out

1700
01:22:04,011 --> 01:22:05,570
into the world,
but you know,

1701
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:09,650
we're in that kind of morphic field is
rupert sheldrick would say in that

1702
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,640
capability of man is all the evil and
all the good,

1703
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:16,580
you know,
the protector as well as the destroyer.

1704
01:22:16,581 --> 01:22:19,970
I mean all of these elements are within
the human psyche.

1705
01:22:20,270 --> 01:22:24,200
And really I think the key is just to
reconcile that and to forgive that.

1706
01:22:24,201 --> 01:22:24,921
Like,
all right,

1707
01:22:24,921 --> 01:22:26,960
yeah,
there's some fucked up animal parts of

1708
01:22:26,961 --> 01:22:27,920
me that,
you know,

1709
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,470
get a,
get sexually aroused in certain

1710
01:22:30,471 --> 01:22:34,760
situations that you shouldn't get
sexually aroused in that get attracted

1711
01:22:34,761 --> 01:22:38,240
to violent situations when that's
actually hurting somebody and just

1712
01:22:38,241 --> 01:22:41,270
reconcile.
Like I'm going to choose not to indulge

1713
01:22:41,271 --> 01:22:44,060
any of those,
but that's a part of humanity,

1714
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:48,260
like the darkness is a part of all of us
and I think that's like a key

1715
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,590
recognition and it's enough to just
choose the light,

1716
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:54,050
to choose love and to choose to be who
you want to be.

1717
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:59,550
I think we're also dealing with a world
that is so complex and so fucked up in

1718
01:23:01,001 --> 01:23:06,001
so many different ways that to expect
someone to be balanced and perfect and

1719
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:12,091
healthy is kind of insane.
Expect someone to be completely free of

1720
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:17,281
any bizarre thoughts or ideas is
ridiculous because we are a product or

1721
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,340
at least we are influenced by the world
that we live in,

1722
01:23:21,610 --> 01:23:23,530
right?
In the world that we live in is insanely

1723
01:23:23,531 --> 01:23:26,320
chaotic.
Recognizing that and talking to that

1724
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:31,740
about that is a big part of the steps
that's going to take to improve whatever

1725
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:34,930
society is.
However we define it,

1726
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:37,480
whatever civilization is right now,
there's gonna.

1727
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,770
There's gonna have to be steps that are
taken in order to make it better and you

1728
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:43,750
got to kind of recognize that you're in
chaos.

1729
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:47,950
Even if we're going to die,
okay,

1730
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:51,550
this is gonna end,
it'll stop and then new people will deal

1731
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:54,460
with the same questions that we're
dealing with now and hopefully we were

1732
01:23:54,461 --> 01:23:59,461
honest about our experiences so that
they can gain some information without

1733
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:04,360
having to go through those same mistakes
themselves and that's part of what

1734
01:24:04,361 --> 01:24:05,350
inspiration is.

1735
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:08,350
It's part of what reading biographies
were all about.

1736
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:12,880
That's part of what talking to people
that are wise and ancient and you know,

1737
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:14,280
unlike clinics,
would they.

1738
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,170
They have some real like,
yeah,

1739
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:17,740
you're like,
yeah,

1740
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:20,350
Stanley Kripner.
You can talk to some really old people

1741
01:24:20,351 --> 01:24:25,351
who are really knowledgeable that have
experienced some bizarre moments in life

1742
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:29,110
and that have come through the other end
with some lessons and I think that

1743
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:35,700
what we're dealing with is a society and
a civilization.

1744
01:24:35,870 --> 01:24:40,330
What would human culture is today?
Is this thing that's becoming awake?

1745
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,640
It's going,
why are we doing this?

1746
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:47,170
Like when we're looking at what we're
seeing on television in terms of these

1747
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:49,840
debates that we're talking about there,
so preposterous.

1748
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:50,741
Well,
they're there.

1749
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:54,900
They're carrying the momentum of decades
and decades of similar debates that

1750
01:24:54,901 --> 01:24:56,980
they.
They feel like this is how they have to

1751
01:24:56,981 --> 01:24:59,260
do it.
When you watch the evening news,

1752
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:04,300
what you're watching is the evening news
is the momentum of the decades of

1753
01:25:04,301 --> 01:25:07,210
evening news,
the expectations that people have.

1754
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:10,090
If it bleeds,
it leads and these things have always

1755
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:14,350
been this way and it's to change that.
It takes a long ass time,

1756
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:19,120
but if you watch the evening news today
and you watched the evening news from

1757
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:21,550
1930,
it is a fucking different.

1758
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:26,140
Humans are different.
If you watch the way people talk from

1759
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:28,350
then and the way people talk today,
if you.

1760
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:33,040
If you look at movies or music or media,
things have become more complex and more

1761
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:38,041
honest and I think culture is becoming
way more aware of these complexities and

1762
01:25:38,891 --> 01:25:43,891
the importance of this.
Honesty in art are attempts to decipher

1763
01:25:44,051 --> 01:25:47,590
what it means to be alive.
There are attempts to decipher what it

1764
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:51,100
means to be a person.
What is the most harmonic way?

1765
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,040
What where,
where?

1766
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:56,110
How can you get through with harmonious
with the most harmonious way to get

1767
01:25:56,111 --> 01:25:57,190
through this experience?

1768
01:25:57,370 --> 01:26:01,870
What's the way to make the least amount
of mistakes and create the most amount

1769
01:26:01,871 --> 01:26:05,810
of happiness and have the most amount of
friends happy as well,

1770
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:09,440
and what is,
how is there a zero clear way?

1771
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:12,800
No is a trial and error thing that's
going on.

1772
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:17,540
There's a failure and success.
There's a lessons learned sort of thing

1773
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:19,970
that's going on and it's not just going
on with you.

1774
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:22,570
It's not just going on with United
States of America.

1775
01:26:22,571 --> 01:26:26,690
It's going on with the entirety of
humans on the planet earth.

1776
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,770
There's a learning thing and it's based
on how much data we're taking in and the

1777
01:26:30,771 --> 01:26:33,500
data were taken today is radically
increased.

1778
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:37,160
There's so much more data than at any
other time in history that we're almost

1779
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:40,610
overwhelmed by it to the point where you
just want to concentrate on gossip.

1780
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,770
He just want to concentrate on fucking
distraction.

1781
01:26:42,771 --> 01:26:44,420
Meek mill and drake beefing.

1782
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:45,620
You know what I mean?
It's shit.

1783
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:47,510
That doesn't mean anything,
but why?

1784
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,930
Because is this almost in a lot of those
cases,

1785
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:55,160
there's comfort in the simplicity of an
affair.

1786
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,170
There's comfort in the simplicity of a
two dudes that are going to fight and be

1787
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,840
like,
I was watching some video of the game,

1788
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,960
the rapper beaten up some other APP.
First of all to that dude needs to learn

1789
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:12,230
how to fight both of them.
Fucking horrible to watch it's shitty

1790
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:15,200
technique as a commentator.
I was appalled,

1791
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,560
but it's,
there's something adorable about

1792
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:23,210
watching some really like clear
conflict,

1793
01:27:23,211 --> 01:27:26,060
really obvious stuff.
It's,

1794
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:29,390
it's,
it takes you away from the complexities.

1795
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:34,250
It takes you away from the ambiguity of
the great picture where the great

1796
01:27:34,251 --> 01:27:38,840
picture I think is about information.
It's about information and,

1797
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:41,700
and figuring out how to apply that in
good information.

1798
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:43,410
Yeah,
and my,

1799
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,830
one of my favorite ways to get
information is just experientially.

1800
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:47,670
And again,
you know,

1801
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:50,550
that's been part of my path is like
figure out,

1802
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:53,880
you know,
go deep within your own psyche and get

1803
01:27:53,881 --> 01:27:55,140
that information out,
you know,

1804
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,410
not just the external information about
things that are going on in the world

1805
01:27:58,411 --> 01:27:59,970
and these new structures that are in
place.

1806
01:27:59,971 --> 01:28:02,060
But like learn yourself,
you know,

1807
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:06,360
learn about your own desires and
weaknesses and fears and demons and

1808
01:28:06,361 --> 01:28:08,100
these things that'll come up.
You know,

1809
01:28:08,101 --> 01:28:11,490
I remember I was in isolation for a
month and I was doing a,

1810
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,940
what's called a [inaudible],
which is a kind of a shamonic

1811
01:28:14,941 --> 01:28:16,260
technology.
I wanted to try.

1812
01:28:16,261 --> 01:28:18,990
I was going to write my book anyway,
so made sense,

1813
01:28:18,991 --> 01:28:22,680
but I was basically meditating every
night and with that clarity of

1814
01:28:22,681 --> 01:28:25,290
meditating every night,
which is something I don't usually do.

1815
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:27,090
It's,
I'm kind of like feast or famine with

1816
01:28:27,091 --> 01:28:28,590
that meditation practice.

1817
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:32,760
But for then I was meditating every
night and it started to shine a light on

1818
01:28:32,761 --> 01:28:34,890
a lot of different aspects of myself.
Nope.

1819
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,570
No,
no plants involved at all.

1820
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,400
Like,
and I started to see,

1821
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,710
you know,
even little tendencies that I could,

1822
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:44,640
that I could cure that would come to me
in my own imagination.

1823
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:48,600
Like I remember I was,
I was in a fight with Whitney and I was,

1824
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:49,410
you know,
really,

1825
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:53,340
really mad at her and you know,
I didn't say anything mean or call her a

1826
01:28:53,341 --> 01:28:55,920
bitch or anything,
but I would like wasn't returning our

1827
01:28:55,921 --> 01:28:57,030
calls.
Right.

1828
01:28:57,090 --> 01:29:00,480
And I knew kind of that was like,
that was hurting her for sure,

1829
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:03,560
but I didn't about it like this,
I'm not going to answer that call she

1830
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:07,260
can do with that.
And so I go into my meditation and I

1831
01:29:07,261 --> 01:29:11,760
start seeing this,
like this image come up of this gorilla

1832
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:16,680
with these big old horns and she's
taking this stock of stock of roses and

1833
01:29:16,681 --> 01:29:19,260
it's hitting Whitney with the stock of
roses,

1834
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,640
like the thorny part.

1835
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,220
And I'm thinking like,
what the fuck is this?

1836
01:29:23,221 --> 01:29:26,580
Why is this in my imagination here as
I'm doing this meditation?

1837
01:29:26,581 --> 01:29:31,260
Then I was thinking about it.
I was intentionally not talking to her

1838
01:29:31,261 --> 01:29:33,110
because I knew it would hurt her,
you know,

1839
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:36,350
but to me it was like my,
my mind was saying like,

1840
01:29:36,540 --> 01:29:38,340
as long as you don't say anything,
you're cool man,

1841
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:39,540
you know,
it's all good,

1842
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:42,240
but just shined a little light and like,
no,

1843
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:46,800
it's not cool under any circumstance to
intentionally hurt somebody you love.

1844
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:48,750
Even if it's just being quiet,
you know,

1845
01:29:48,751 --> 01:29:52,140
like that's fucked up too.
So you get these little pieces of

1846
01:29:52,141 --> 01:29:55,910
information where now all the sudden,
you know what I thought was like

1847
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:59,010
unacceptable behavior.
Oh you just go quiet.

1848
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:00,900
That's acceptable.
It's not being mean,

1849
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,070
you know?
Oh No,

1850
01:30:02,071 --> 01:30:02,311
no,
no.

1851
01:30:02,311 --> 01:30:04,260
That is mean.
That is kind of fucked up because you're

1852
01:30:04,261 --> 01:30:06,870
withdrawing your love and you're hurting
somebody.

1853
01:30:06,871 --> 01:30:11,130
So these little like course corrections
that can come from the knowledge of

1854
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:14,160
going within.
I think that's one of the most important

1855
01:30:14,161 --> 01:30:17,970
things we can do as well as absorbing
all the knowledge externally.

1856
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:21,360
Like put as much focus on the inside as
the outside.

1857
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:22,431
Well,
most people,

1858
01:30:22,431 --> 01:30:25,250
when they get involved in any sort of an
argument with somebody,

1859
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,280
they immediately start shoring up their
defense,

1860
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:29,360
you know,
fuck her,

1861
01:30:29,361 --> 01:30:32,060
I told her this,
and you have this whole like,

1862
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,150
you have these walls set up,
you have your armor meant you have

1863
01:30:35,151 --> 01:30:36,260
every,
all your weapons.

1864
01:30:36,261 --> 01:30:39,020
If she says anything about that,
I'm going to bring up the time.

1865
01:30:39,021 --> 01:30:42,530
She fucking did this.
And that's why it's so frustrating for

1866
01:30:42,531 --> 01:30:44,780
people when they have a conversation
about something like,

1867
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:45,650
you know,
hey,

1868
01:30:45,651 --> 01:30:47,510
how come you didn't put gas in the car?
You know,

1869
01:30:47,511 --> 01:30:49,490
you said you,
you fucking dropped the car off and I'm

1870
01:30:49,491 --> 01:30:51,320
fucked.
Now I've got to find a gas station.

1871
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:52,340
Yeah.
Well you know,

1872
01:30:52,341 --> 01:30:55,490
you should have done this last week when
my friend came over and you told her

1873
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,020
like,
what does that have to do with anything?

1874
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:02,200
Just always built up resentment and the
built in defense and instead of handling

1875
01:31:03,351 --> 01:31:08,351
that situation like I remember dating
girls in the past that you could never

1876
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:12,590
talk to them about something because
they would bring up some other shit that

1877
01:31:12,591 --> 01:31:16,760
was completely nonrelated and not even
address what you're talking about.

1878
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,820
They would just talk about some other
thing that happened a month ago or six

1879
01:31:19,821 --> 01:31:21,690
months ago or a year ago.
Like,

1880
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:22,740
oh my God,
like,

1881
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:24,920
I can't.
This is not going to happen.

1882
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:26,180
We can't do this.
You can't.

1883
01:31:26,181 --> 01:31:28,880
You can't talk about the like,
what will you need to fucking admit the

1884
01:31:28,881 --> 01:31:29,714
fact that you did.
That

1885
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,540
has nothing to do with what we're
saying.

1886
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:33,860
Right?
Nothing to do with what we're saying,

1887
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:37,430
but they've got their defense shored up.
They've got their walls up,

1888
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:40,730
they got their weapons and they're ready
to fucking go to war and that's what it

1889
01:31:40,731 --> 01:31:41,300
is.
You know?

1890
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,730
It's,
and it's so easy to get stuck in these

1891
01:31:43,731 --> 01:31:46,010
kinds of mine because the ego wants to
be right.

1892
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:50,240
The Ego wants to be superior.
The Ego's first line always is how dare

1893
01:31:50,241 --> 01:31:52,190
you and you want to win.
You want to win too.

1894
01:31:52,191 --> 01:31:54,920
Yeah.
If you don't believe that you're beyond

1895
01:31:54,921 --> 01:31:56,330
reproach,
even if you don't believe you're

1896
01:31:56,331 --> 01:32:01,030
innocent though this is a fucking game
of and you want to figure out how to get

1897
01:32:01,031 --> 01:32:02,380
that king knocked over.

1898
01:32:02,470 --> 01:32:04,150
You want to get to checkmate.
Yep.

1899
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:05,163
Yeah,
and that's.

1900
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:09,720
It's definitely the sticky little trap.
Whereas when you find yourself in that,

1901
01:32:09,721 --> 01:32:12,490
you know,
the solution has actually let the mind

1902
01:32:12,491 --> 01:32:15,760
with all of its manifestations go and
just focus back to the heart.

1903
01:32:16,150 --> 01:32:19,720
Focus back to those truths,
like the platinum rule that we talked

1904
01:32:19,721 --> 01:32:21,040
about like,
oh,

1905
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,710
that's another me living a different
life.

1906
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:27,940
Like that's not fucking crushed them and
when and hurt them.

1907
01:32:28,180 --> 01:32:32,770
Let's just see what's best for the good
of both of us and like take it back to

1908
01:32:32,771 --> 01:32:37,771
that simpler kind of slower truth that
we find like deep within our own

1909
01:32:38,111 --> 01:32:41,890
consciousness inside our heart.
And there's also a reality that some

1910
01:32:41,891 --> 01:32:45,490
people you got to let go because you're
not on the same path as you and they

1911
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:47,830
will drag you down with that.
You know,

1912
01:32:47,831 --> 01:32:49,060
you should have done this and blah,
blah,

1913
01:32:49,061 --> 01:32:49,301
blah,
blah,

1914
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:49,950
blah,
blah.

1915
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:53,140
There's some people that were will
always be in conflict,

1916
01:32:53,141 --> 01:32:55,280
are always going to be fucking up.
They're always gonna,

1917
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:59,380
not pay their taxes and being this
constant state of fucking chaos.

1918
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:03,250
They're always going to be caught lying.
They're always going to be doing this or

1919
01:33:03,251 --> 01:33:07,810
stealing or there's people that are
going to always do something wrong and

1920
01:33:07,811 --> 01:33:11,080
you can't keep them in your life because
they have to find their own path.

1921
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,980
Even if that is you living another life,
you're not helping them by enabling them

1922
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:18,610
now,
by continuing the cycle of like makeup,

1923
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:21,790
like fight makeup,
fight makeup,

1924
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:25,780
come to some acknowledgement within
denial afterwards,

1925
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:30,790
you you will be caught in their own
conflict and that same sort of thing

1926
01:33:30,791 --> 01:33:35,020
where I said that the complexities of
life oftentimes lead us to pay attention

1927
01:33:35,021 --> 01:33:38,060
to simple,
stupid shit like you hear Kanye is going

1928
01:33:38,061 --> 01:33:41,910
to get divorced from Kim because Ron,
well,

1929
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,520
what is that?

1930
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:45,040
It's like you're.
You're looking for some simple stupid,

1931
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,100
clearly,
easily defined shit to distract you from

1932
01:33:48,101 --> 01:33:50,230
the complexities of the world.
Well,

1933
01:33:50,231 --> 01:33:55,231
if you get involved in a friendship with
someone that's really fucked up and,

1934
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:58,900
and you know,
steals from you or just have some

1935
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:04,620
horrible shit going on,
that debt will take away from all the

1936
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:07,630
other stuff that you're doing.
It will become a massive part of your

1937
01:34:07,631 --> 01:34:10,960
life and that conflict,
which may you may be completely

1938
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:12,910
innocent.
He might not have anything to do with

1939
01:34:12,911 --> 01:34:14,800
it,
but you're trapped with this person that

1940
01:34:14,801 --> 01:34:18,210
might have a drug addiction.
Like if you have someone like for

1941
01:34:18,220 --> 01:34:21,880
people,
a lot of people that have family members

1942
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:24,760
that are hooked on drugs,
it's insanely,

1943
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:26,980
extremely frustrating because they'll
like,

1944
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:28,090
like,
uh,

1945
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:32,050
I know guys who have stolen from their
own mother to pay for their drug habits.

1946
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,780
Yeah.
Could you imagine you have a child and

1947
01:34:34,781 --> 01:34:39,781
you raise your child and your child is
stealing from you to pay for drugs and

1948
01:34:40,481 --> 01:34:42,140
you're kind of in denial about it and
you,

1949
01:34:42,170 --> 01:34:45,070
but you're trapped.
You're in this conflict with this person

1950
01:34:45,370 --> 01:34:48,280
and there's almost no way in your mind
to fix it,

1951
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:50,530
to make it better.
And it becomes your life.

1952
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,280
You know,
if you have a child and your child

1953
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:55,540
constantly in and out of jail and you
know,

1954
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:58,040
fucking up and doing horrible things,

1955
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,520
you,
you become trapped by that relationship

1956
01:35:01,521 --> 01:35:02,910
that you have.
You have,

1957
01:35:02,990 --> 01:35:06,140
you have a right to your own happiness
and we got to make sure that you protect

1958
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:07,100
that,
you know,

1959
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:10,370
and these people who are living on
compulsion,

1960
01:35:10,371 --> 01:35:13,130
it's almost like they've forgotten their
forgone,

1961
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,610
their right to choose their ability to
choose their compulsion.

1962
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:20,300
It's compulsion for more drugs.
That's compulsion for more emotional

1963
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:23,600
turbulence.
It's compulsion for needing something

1964
01:35:23,601 --> 01:35:26,630
like that.
And those people are naturally like the

1965
01:35:26,631 --> 01:35:30,110
hardest to be around because they don't
have that stillness where they can,

1966
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,960
you know,
kind of wrangle their ability to choose,

1967
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:34,510
you know,
to me like choices,

1968
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,260
like breath,
like it's going to happen no matter

1969
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:38,240
what.
We're going to make decisions no matter

1970
01:35:38,241 --> 01:35:39,860
what,
just like we're going to breathe no

1971
01:35:39,861 --> 01:35:43,340
matter what you know.
But then there's also the ability to

1972
01:35:43,341 --> 01:35:45,850
wrangle your choice and decide how you
breathe.

1973
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:48,530
Maybe
deep breath,

1974
01:35:48,531 --> 01:35:52,910
you take control and you actually can
maneuver with that choice and actually

1975
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:55,980
start to make reasonable decisions of,
you know,

1976
01:35:56,050 --> 01:36:00,800
acting on your own volition rather than
compulsion and getting people around you

1977
01:36:00,801 --> 01:36:05,120
who are also able to do that is so key
because then you can actually have some

1978
01:36:05,121 --> 01:36:09,860
freedom to make decisions and to build
cool shit or to explore cool things or

1979
01:36:09,861 --> 01:36:10,780
have,
you know,

1980
01:36:10,790 --> 01:36:13,580
have a lot of fun and those are the
people that I think are going to be the

1981
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:15,200
most beneficial to be around.
Yeah.

1982
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:19,640
And also you build momentum together.
That's the thing about having friends

1983
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:24,641
that are like really happy and fun and
warm and,

1984
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,950
and doing what they want to do.
Like when I have friends that are

1985
01:36:27,951 --> 01:36:30,290
successful,
it makes me excited about success.

1986
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:33,650
If I have friends that are involved in
good things,

1987
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:34,880
everything's going great.

1988
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,210
It gets me excited about doing more
myself,

1989
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:41,750
getting more good shit done,
enjoying life more.

1990
01:36:41,751 --> 01:36:45,340
And then when you spend time together
there's all this fun and laughter and

1991
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:49,310
it's like good times.
Whereas if you're involved in these

1992
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:54,290
negative patterns and these patterns of
like constant chaos and mistakes and

1993
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:58,250
deception and Horse Shit and addiction
or whatever the fuck it is,

1994
01:36:58,460 --> 01:37:02,690
those patterns seem to just be overwhelm
everything else in life.

1995
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:05,420
Yeah.
One of the most impactful things that I

1996
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:09,860
did last year was I went on that summit
at sea cruise and I thought it was not

1997
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,080
going to be that cool,
but what was the most cool part?

1998
01:37:12,081 --> 01:37:13,860
There was some great speeches,
some good content.

1999
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:15,140
Is it what is summit?
It's so.

2000
01:37:15,141 --> 01:37:18,590
It's like a curated group of
entrepreneurs,

2001
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:21,110
thought leaders,
musicians,

2002
01:37:21,111 --> 01:37:22,790
artists,
different people who have.

2003
01:37:22,791 --> 01:37:27,050
They've invited to come basically hang
out for a little while and interact and

2004
01:37:27,051 --> 01:37:29,030
so there's some speeches and people give
content.

2005
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:34,031
There was the CEO of Uber and a Schmidt,
the ex ceo of Google and there was a

2006
01:37:34,971 --> 01:37:36,500
bunch of.
Bob Pittman was there,

2007
01:37:36,510 --> 01:37:39,930
gave a great speech and Shep Gordon,
the famous music agent.

2008
01:37:39,931 --> 01:37:43,850
So a lot of like bigger names.
They are giving speeches and doing their

2009
01:37:43,851 --> 01:37:46,490
thing,
but there's just the general guest lists

2010
01:37:46,491 --> 01:37:49,160
with people who were somehow,
you know,

2011
01:37:49,161 --> 01:37:52,880
doing something cool,
but what the effect was is having 2,500

2012
01:37:52,881 --> 01:37:56,400
people who generally all,
everybody there

2013
01:37:56,640 --> 01:38:00,150
had the attitude of we can do anything,
we can totally do anything.

2014
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:04,140
Like anything is possible.
Like just the effect of being surrounded

2015
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:09,440
by 2,500 people who all believed that
anything was possible was just fucking

2016
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:12,660
super inspiring because you never,
you never,

2017
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:15,720
you know,
aggregate that many people who feel like

2018
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:17,970
that those are the anomalies and most
people are like,

2019
01:38:17,971 --> 01:38:20,080
oh man,
fml,

2020
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,300
this fucking sucks.
You know,

2021
01:38:21,301 --> 01:38:24,060
you get a good mix of both of those
things,

2022
01:38:24,061 --> 01:38:27,820
the inspiring people and the people who
were kind of bummed out and that's

2023
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,230
fucked my life for people going
and so,

2024
01:38:31,410 --> 01:38:33,670
but being on the boat like everybody
believing like,

2025
01:38:33,671 --> 01:38:34,890
yeah,
anything's possible.

2026
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:36,390
What are we going to create?
How are we going to do this?

2027
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:37,950
What's the social problem?
What's this thing?

2028
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:40,890
Just that alone was worth it,
you know,

2029
01:38:40,891 --> 01:38:41,970
to just be like,
man,

2030
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,720
that was fucking cool because your mind
takes in all of that.

2031
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:49,560
You kind of like absorb it if that's.
If that's the norm around you.

2032
01:38:49,950 --> 01:38:51,470
You know,
like there's a lot of people say that

2033
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,340
you're the average of your five best
friends.

2034
01:38:53,341 --> 01:38:57,000
Like if that's the norm around you,
you start to believe that even more

2035
01:38:57,001 --> 01:38:58,510
strongly to like,
fuck yeah,

2036
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,810
it's possible.
Like what do we want to do?

2037
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,100
What,
what do we want to create?

2038
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:06,330
Isn't that why being in a really
horrible neighborhood is so insidious,

2039
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:09,690
like being born and raised in a horrible
neighborhood is so insidious because

2040
01:39:09,691 --> 01:39:12,180
you're kind of trapped by your
environment a lot of ways,

2041
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:17,160
but that's what one of the things that
people that you know have that pull

2042
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:21,030
yourself up by your bootstraps mentality
don't take into account.

2043
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:23,700
It's like these people,
they don't see that.

2044
01:39:23,730 --> 01:39:26,940
Like where are they getting this?
Or you're asking them to build an

2045
01:39:26,941 --> 01:39:31,320
insane,
raging fire with nothing but wet trees

2046
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,690
and to rocks to bank and stuff like
that.

2047
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,430
Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.
I've done it well,

2048
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:37,980
no,
you had a fucking lighter.

2049
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,950
Okay,
and you had newspapers and you had dry

2050
01:39:40,951 --> 01:39:44,820
wood and you had a fireplace in a
beautiful mansion and you were watching

2051
01:39:44,821 --> 01:39:46,840
people build fires your whole life.
You know,

2052
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:52,510
and everybody knew how to build a fire.
So this idea that everyone starts on a

2053
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:57,720
level playing field and you just need to
escape from your environment because

2054
01:39:57,721 --> 01:40:01,530
you're ambitious and you know you're,
you only ambitious if you're allowed to

2055
01:40:01,531 --> 01:40:06,210
be ambitious like you.
You have to have someone around you that

2056
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:10,080
has some sense of difference that
there's some.

2057
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:13,860
Something can be done that,
that is more,

2058
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:18,690
more pleasurable,
something can be done that is better.

2059
01:40:18,691 --> 01:40:20,170
You can improve upon your surrounding
you.

2060
01:40:20,171 --> 01:40:22,350
You have to see that if you don't see
that,

2061
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,730
you just assume,
well,

2062
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:24,750
this is how we live.

2063
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:28,950
We scratch and claw where like the
chimps in the jungle that steal from

2064
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:30,630
each other and beat each other over the
head.

2065
01:40:30,930 --> 01:40:34,530
And then we're going to have to figure
out a way to survive.

2066
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,570
And the way to survive is scratch and
claw.

2067
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:37,610
Well,
if you're in,

2068
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:42,610
you know you live in some horrible,
poor neighborhood and that's how it is.

2069
01:40:42,691 --> 01:40:45,450
Everybody is survival of the fittest
around you all the time,

2070
01:40:45,451 --> 01:40:49,290
all the scratching and clawing and
that's your reality that you have to

2071
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:51,630
adapt.
You have to stay alive that way and

2072
01:40:51,631 --> 01:40:54,010
that's the dark ages.
That's the inquisition.

2073
01:40:54,011 --> 01:40:56,050
That's like your.
This is the environment you're in.

2074
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:59,380
It's so hard to escape the environment
or to change it.

2075
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:04,530
If you're stuck in a situation like
savior in like some isis occupied city

2076
01:41:05,261 --> 01:41:06,370
right now,
like what?

2077
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:07,930
What are you going to do?
Think positive.

2078
01:41:07,950 --> 01:41:08,500
What are you going do?

2079
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:11,020
Go to yoga.
The fuck are you going to do you know

2080
01:41:11,021 --> 01:41:11,854
you,
you have to.

2081
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:17,310
Reality is a motherfucker and you have
to accept the situation that you're

2082
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:18,760
presented with.
If you,

2083
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:21,970
if you don't,
this idea that you could somehow or

2084
01:41:21,971 --> 01:41:26,971
another rise above just simply by
thinking positive and doing the right

2085
01:41:28,361 --> 01:41:29,141
thing.
Well no,

2086
01:41:29,141 --> 01:41:29,590
your,
your,

2087
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:33,010
your,
your situation is constant conflict.

2088
01:41:33,011 --> 01:41:36,190
You involved in that.
Unless you can figure out some sort of a

2089
01:41:36,191 --> 01:41:39,790
way to end that across the board with
the entire country.

2090
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:40,860
The entire world,
the,

2091
01:41:40,890 --> 01:41:42,610
the planet earth,
all of humanity.

2092
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:44,880
We're always going to have issues.
We're always,

2093
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,340
you know,
there are certain circumstances though

2094
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:51,880
where that kind of external pressure,
everything being so fucked up,

2095
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,340
we'll crack most people like you're
saying,

2096
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:56,920
but then they'll occasionally be.
These diamonds are formed.

2097
01:41:56,921 --> 01:41:59,230
You know,
these people who define themselves

2098
01:41:59,231 --> 01:42:04,030
against this horrible resistance around
them and because it was so hard for them

2099
01:42:04,031 --> 01:42:06,730
to build the fire,
to use that analogy with their wet ass

2100
01:42:06,731 --> 01:42:10,780
newspapers and these two flints and
they've just been striking and striking

2101
01:42:10,781 --> 01:42:12,730
and striking when they actually do it.

2102
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:15,160
Their skills that they bring to the
table,

2103
01:42:15,161 --> 01:42:16,990
they're the baddest motherfuckers
around.

2104
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:22,200
So occasionally it can create these
masterful human beings that are just

2105
01:42:22,290 --> 01:42:25,570
defined in greatness by their struggle
coming up.

2106
01:42:25,571 --> 01:42:27,700
And I think we all know a lot of those
people.

2107
01:42:27,701 --> 01:42:29,170
You even,
I think at one point said,

2108
01:42:29,300 --> 01:42:31,240
you know,
show me the great man that's a son of a

2109
01:42:31,241 --> 01:42:35,380
great man because you know that you do
need some of this resistance to really

2110
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:40,030
be as you know,
as magnificent as you can possibly be in

2111
01:42:40,031 --> 01:42:42,010
a lot of circumstances.
But yeah,

2112
01:42:42,011 --> 01:42:45,070
in general it's hard because while
there'll be one diamond,

2113
01:42:45,071 --> 01:42:46,020
there'll be,
you know,

2114
01:42:46,030 --> 01:42:49,750
a thousand pieces of crushed call that
it's just the pressure of the

2115
01:42:49,751 --> 01:42:53,470
environment is not supportive for the
general population.

2116
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:55,300
It's also like that movie,
um,

2117
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,590
was that band movie where they were,
um,

2118
01:42:58,360 --> 01:43:01,810
there was that a composer who was trying
to get,

2119
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:05,890
he was the state,
like the farmer's insurance guy who was

2120
01:43:05,891 --> 01:43:08,650
a composer and he won like Academy
Awards,

2121
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:09,970
Farmer's insurance guy.

2122
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:14,200
He was a fuck,
I can't remember.

2123
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:15,410
But anyways,
he was like,

2124
01:43:15,490 --> 01:43:17,900
he was like,
he was a composer or like a,

2125
01:43:18,010 --> 01:43:19,480
um,
yeah.

2126
01:43:19,510 --> 01:43:22,630
And he was basically taking one of his
students and he would,

2127
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:25,270
he would take his students and he was
like the worst coach ever,

2128
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:30,290
like just recently.
So in whiplash,

2129
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,670
you know,
it was the most brutal hours insurance

2130
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:35,200
guy.
The guy from Oz.

2131
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:36,580
Yeah,
the screamer.

2132
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:38,220
Yeah.
So he would have,

2133
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:41,020
he died the most brutal methods for his
whole people.

2134
01:43:41,021 --> 01:43:42,790
I mean,
they're playing until their fingers were

2135
01:43:42,791 --> 01:43:45,490
bloody and he just basically broke
everybody.

2136
01:43:45,491 --> 01:43:48,670
He broke everybody.
And what he was waiting for was that one

2137
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:50,290
diamond to emerge,
right.

2138
01:43:50,440 --> 01:43:52,040
And a lot of have that kind

2139
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,960
of mentality.
Like we'll break them down,

2140
01:43:53,961 --> 01:43:56,660
we'll break everybody and then there'll
be this greatness that comes.

2141
01:43:57,110 --> 01:43:59,300
Well,
it's really like super rare that that

2142
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:01,850
happens.
And generally like not worth it,

2143
01:44:02,060 --> 01:44:04,400
you know,
like why not like have people enjoy

2144
01:44:04,401 --> 01:44:07,280
music and lead by inspiration instead of
this.

2145
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,660
Let's just fucking break everybody and
hope that that one time you strike the

2146
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:14,690
hammer down,
it doesn't break and the hammer breaks

2147
01:44:14,691 --> 01:44:17,180
instead because you've actually struck a
diamond.

2148
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:21,380
It's just kinda like weird ethos that I
think a lot of coaches and a lot of

2149
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:23,600
people have.
My High School basketball coach had that

2150
01:44:23,601 --> 01:44:26,270
same thing.
Like he was willing to make the entire

2151
01:44:26,271 --> 01:44:30,830
basketball season miserable,
completely miserable in order to try and

2152
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:33,710
get something out of the players,
which never happened.

2153
01:44:33,711 --> 01:44:35,600
We lost in the first round of the
playoffs,

2154
01:44:35,601 --> 01:44:39,470
no matter how highly ranked we were,
because part of our motivation is just

2155
01:44:39,471 --> 01:44:42,000
to get the fucking season over because
we hated him.

2156
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:46,940
Fucking hated him.
So we had like mixed motivations,

2157
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:49,970
effective coach.
And an ineffective and so,

2158
01:44:49,971 --> 01:44:52,640
but there is that.
You do create occasional diamonds with

2159
01:44:52,641 --> 01:44:55,220
pressure,
but for the most part it just crushes

2160
01:44:55,221 --> 01:44:57,230
most people and sometimes those
diamonds,

2161
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:59,270
they become like a guy like Nelson
Mandela,

2162
01:44:59,271 --> 01:45:03,740
that sort of elevated entire culture,
right in their King Nelson Mandela,

2163
01:45:03,741 --> 01:45:07,400
these different individuals who you know
were defined by this,

2164
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:09,920
by this intensity.
So it's not to say that it's a hopeless

2165
01:45:09,921 --> 01:45:13,310
situation.
It can create the greatest of the great,

2166
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:16,310
but it's going to be a real fucking
challenge.

2167
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,140
It is,
and for most people,

2168
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,700
expecting those folks that are in that
environment to to behave the same way as

2169
01:45:22,701 --> 01:45:24,920
people that live in a gated community in
Pasadena,

2170
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:29,570
just it's completely unrealistic in.
And that was the trump point.

2171
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:31,190
It's like,
c'mon man,

2172
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:34,520
like you.
You've had not just a silver spoon.

2173
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:39,710
You've had the entire cutler early line
in your mouth since you were a baby.

2174
01:45:39,711 --> 01:45:42,210
You were born with it.
The whole thing is it's,

2175
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:45,080
it's unfair.
It's unfair and uneven.

2176
01:45:45,081 --> 01:45:49,280
It's bizarre to me that some folks don't
recognize that,

2177
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,960
that they don't see it.
They don't.

2178
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:53,270
They don't look at it like,
wow,

2179
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:55,070
there's,
there's a lot of conflict out there.

2180
01:45:55,071 --> 01:45:57,140
There's a lot of different conditions.
They vary.

2181
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:59,690
It vary so much.
Yep.

2182
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,870
I think there's also a tendency to say
that,

2183
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:05,690
you know,
to expect people who do,

2184
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:10,010
who are wealthy to just be totally happy
and totally like avid together.

2185
01:46:10,011 --> 01:46:13,040
Look at all the advantage you have when
a lot of times you see these people,

2186
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:14,840
they're pretty fucked up,
you know,

2187
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,460
but society says,
look,

2188
01:46:16,461 --> 01:46:17,900
you've had every opportunity.
You know,

2189
01:46:17,901 --> 01:46:19,700
you didn't have to struggle,
you should be fine.

2190
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:20,960
Well,
again,

2191
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:23,780
those internal forces or a motherfucker,
you know,

2192
01:46:23,781 --> 01:46:25,330
and if you're not dealing with those
right,

2193
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:26,900
doesn't matter how much money you start
with,

2194
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:30,020
you're going to have problems.
You have all the money to access all the

2195
01:46:30,021 --> 01:46:33,110
drugs in the world.
You have all of the ways to escape and

2196
01:46:33,111 --> 01:46:35,270
not any of the tools,
you know,

2197
01:46:35,271 --> 01:46:39,890
to actually help you overcome those.
So in a lot of cases you see the

2198
01:46:39,891 --> 01:46:43,790
children of these really wealthy people
are some of the most fucked up people

2199
01:46:44,010 --> 01:46:45,150
you know,
around there.

2200
01:46:45,180 --> 01:46:45,860
Just.
Yeah.

2201
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:49,140
It's just a really interesting thing.
Like you'd rather hang with somebody in

2202
01:46:49,141 --> 01:46:50,340
a super poor neighborhood

2203
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:54,240
who's just real and down to earth and
mostly they have their shit together way

2204
01:46:54,241 --> 01:46:57,420
more than someone living in one of these
mcmansions somewhere.

2205
01:46:57,450 --> 01:46:58,950
Well,
they've been forced to deal with

2206
01:46:58,951 --> 01:47:01,110
conflict.
They'd be forced to find solutions.

2207
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:02,970
They've had been forced to develop
character.

2208
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:07,140
We define success too much by Zeros,
by numbers,

2209
01:47:07,141 --> 01:47:09,360
by yeah.
How much do you have?

2210
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:12,690
How much money do you have?
That's the ultimate goal of success

2211
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:17,990
instead of are you a happy person?
I was listening to this Ted talk and it

2212
01:47:18,211 --> 01:47:23,211
was a woman who was a model and she was
talking about how she hit the genetic

2213
01:47:23,701 --> 01:47:25,350
lottery.
She was really honest about it.

2214
01:47:25,351 --> 01:47:26,640
She's like,
for better or for worse,

2215
01:47:26,730 --> 01:47:29,850
you know,
this is what has been my life.

2216
01:47:29,870 --> 01:47:31,350
This is,
this is my existence.

2217
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:36,690
And she said that a lot of people have
this idea about what makes you happy.

2218
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:39,270
If my legs were thinner,
I'd be happy.

2219
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:41,430
If my hair was Shinier,
I'd be happy.

2220
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:44,400
If my face was,
my bone structure was better,

2221
01:47:44,401 --> 01:47:45,750
I'd be happy.
She said,

2222
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:50,751
but models in general are some of the
most unhappy,

2223
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:53,880
insecure people on the planet,
and she's like,

2224
01:47:53,881 --> 01:47:55,650
I'll tell you,
I am insecure.

2225
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,740
Like all my friends are insecure.
They are crazy.

2226
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:03,120
There are all these nutty fucking models
that are dealing with bulemia and

2227
01:48:03,121 --> 01:48:08,070
Anorexia and speed and all these
different methods that they use to keep

2228
01:48:08,071 --> 01:48:12,540
their body weight down and all the fear
they have of aging and you know,

2229
01:48:12,541 --> 01:48:16,140
should I get botox and what treatments
should I be doing?

2230
01:48:16,141 --> 01:48:21,141
And they're constantly in this state of
chaos and fear and a lot of it is over

2231
01:48:23,341 --> 01:48:28,260
this weird gift that they have that
becomes almost a prison,

2232
01:48:28,590 --> 01:48:33,450
a prison to maintain this garden of
beauty that you've been bestowed with

2233
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:36,150
from birth without any work at all.

2234
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:38,250
I mean,
we've all seen people that are just

2235
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:41,250
fucking beautiful.
They just have a written and everyone's

2236
01:48:41,251 --> 01:48:43,150
drawn to them genetically.
And why?

2237
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:43,861
Why is that?
Well,

2238
01:48:43,861 --> 01:48:47,700
because nature wants you to come in that
person to make people like them because

2239
01:48:47,701 --> 01:48:49,860
they have good symmetry and it's really
that simple.

2240
01:48:49,861 --> 01:48:53,490
But that poll,
that genetic poll is so overwhelming

2241
01:48:53,491 --> 01:48:58,491
that we use it to sell cars and we use
it to sell fucking condos and you know,

2242
01:48:59,101 --> 01:49:01,080
anything,
a woman with long legs,

2243
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:02,750
you know,
stepping into a car,

2244
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:03,720
looking at you,
they're here,

2245
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:06,630
makes you want to buy that car for
whatever fucking stupid reason.

2246
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:11,820
And this idea that we have that.
If I have that,

2247
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:13,890
I would be happy.
No,

2248
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:17,790
because look at the people who have it.
How many people who are super wealthy,

2249
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:22,230
how many Wall Street people in Manhattan
right now are ready to jump off a

2250
01:49:22,231 --> 01:49:24,000
fucking building?
Their freaking.

2251
01:49:24,001 --> 01:49:26,220
They might have 100 million dollars in
the bank.

2252
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:28,680
They might be rich as fuck,
but they're miserable.

2253
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:30,630
They hate.
They're just want to do coke.

2254
01:49:30,870 --> 01:49:35,760
And the other thing about people that
are successful is oftentimes what

2255
01:49:35,761 --> 01:49:38,490
they're doing is not pleasurable but
the.

2256
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:43,760
But the reward is the numbers.
The reward is having numbers so they

2257
01:49:44,221 --> 01:49:48,340
indulge in that reward where they want
to buy versace

2258
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:53,340
and wear a rolex and have a this and a
that and live in that or this and always

2259
01:49:53,771 --> 01:49:57,340
keep up with the Jones'.
And always have this quantified results

2260
01:49:57,580 --> 01:49:59,320
that they can show success.
Like,

2261
01:49:59,321 --> 01:50:00,160
look,
I've got,

2262
01:50:00,420 --> 01:50:03,370
you know,
in my day I've achieved blah blah,

2263
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:04,910
blah,
and I've got a all of them,

2264
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:09,100
but who are you and are you happy?
And that's not something that you can

2265
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:12,040
put down on a,
on a ledger,

2266
01:50:12,041 --> 01:50:15,760
you can't show that.
You can't have a spreadsheet that shows

2267
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:17,260
your happiness.
Yeah,

2268
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:19,480
I mean I've,
I've been in all different types of

2269
01:50:19,481 --> 01:50:24,400
circles from being indigenous places
where they have virtually nothing in

2270
01:50:24,401 --> 01:50:28,660
hanging out with local tribes in Africa
and South America and different places

2271
01:50:28,661 --> 01:50:31,540
than I've been at.
I was at a birthday party where the

2272
01:50:31,541 --> 01:50:36,541
musical lineup was John foggerty
stinging and like some other crazy pan

2273
01:50:37,481 --> 01:50:38,470
at a birthday party.

2274
01:50:38,470 --> 01:50:40,790
Right.
Who's fucking birthday party present.

2275
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,320
Yeah.
I don't know if I should mention her

2276
01:50:42,550 --> 01:50:43,390
name,
but yeah,

2277
01:50:43,391 --> 01:50:46,630
it was a big hedge fund trader that was
an old family friend.

2278
01:50:46,900 --> 01:50:48,590
How much they spend,
who knows?

2279
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:50,560
Countless,
countless millions,

2280
01:50:50,561 --> 01:50:52,990
you know,
and not a party on a party for his

2281
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:57,780
birthday.
So I was there and color for sure on the

2282
01:50:57,790 --> 01:50:59,080
other way.
They're happier.

2283
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:01,900
That guy's out there,
so it was a weird thing though,

2284
01:51:01,901 --> 01:51:04,390
because you know,
he was actually pretty happy.

2285
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:05,080
He's a,
he's a,

2286
01:51:05,080 --> 01:51:08,560
he's a hunter and he's a.
he's a cool dude and he was throwing the

2287
01:51:08,561 --> 01:51:13,561
party more for his guests than himself,
which made him actually happier.

2288
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:16,000
He was like the happiest person there
because he was like,

2289
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,940
let me give you guys this,
this awesome thing,

2290
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:23,320
but the majority of the people there,
you could just feel I got pretty high

2291
01:51:23,321 --> 01:51:26,590
before I went because I was by myself
and I could just feel the sadness.

2292
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:29,510
It reminded me of when I walked through
the red light district in Amsterdam or

2293
01:51:29,511 --> 01:51:34,030
it was just like the sadness,
like nobody was giving these people like

2294
01:51:34,031 --> 01:51:35,690
a real hug.
It was always a,

2295
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:39,550
let me give you a hug and try and take
your money and give you a hug.

2296
01:51:39,551 --> 01:51:42,970
Try and take your money.
And they were just so guarded by that

2297
01:51:42,971 --> 01:51:45,670
whole paradigm that they've been in.
You know,

2298
01:51:45,671 --> 01:51:49,810
there's just these challenges that are
across the board that we have to

2299
01:51:49,811 --> 01:51:53,140
recognize in these traps,
like the trap of more money.

2300
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:57,040
The trap of social media,
when you know a girl posts something in

2301
01:51:57,041 --> 01:51:59,710
a sexy photos and then looks immediately
refresh,

2302
01:51:59,711 --> 01:52:00,550
refresh,
refresh,

2303
01:52:00,551 --> 01:52:02,440
how many likes,
how many likes,

2304
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:05,800
how many likes this quantification of
how pretty you are,

2305
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:09,430
and then you start to live by that and
then if you get less than that all,

2306
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:11,200
fuck,
I only got 60 likes on that.

2307
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,210
Better slot it up.
Maybe I'm getting too old.

2308
01:52:13,211 --> 01:52:17,470
Maybe any more botox.
I'll do it as a new treatment of vampire

2309
01:52:17,471 --> 01:52:19,460
treatments.
Stab your fucking skin.

2310
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:21,900
Put baby blood in there.
Yeah,

2311
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:25,420
exactly.
So it's just traps and this were things

2312
01:52:25,421 --> 01:52:27,670
a lot.
I have a few girls that are follow on

2313
01:52:27,671 --> 01:52:31,960
instagram just to look at their but
pictures just to show how many different

2314
01:52:31,961 --> 01:52:35,590
ways can you stick your butt out.
How long can you keep doing this?

2315
01:52:36,010 --> 01:52:39,190
And there's this one girl,
her entire fucking instagram is her and

2316
01:52:39,191 --> 01:52:43,930
her underwear sticking her butt out in
various ways or her at the gym and what

2317
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:46,120
might as well be her underwear.
You know,

2318
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:50,620
jen selter got really famous that way.
That was one of the instagram checks had

2319
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:54,830
like millions of followers just from
showing us photos.

2320
01:52:54,940 --> 01:52:56,870
Just ridiculous.
Shell fast.

2321
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:59,390
Yeah.
That just came out and said she is a

2322
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:00,620
real though,
right?

2323
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:02,720
Like she has legs to that go along with
it.

2324
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:05,210
It looks real.
It looks real when they don't have the

2325
01:53:05,211 --> 01:53:05,931
legs.
It's like,

2326
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:08,180
wait a minute.
Why is all that weight in your ass?

2327
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:12,050
Anatomically,
it's like having boulder shoulders but

2328
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:15,380
having like little skinny arms.
Why are your shoulder so big?

2329
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:17,480
It doesn't make sense.
Is that her?

2330
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:20,980
Jesus Christ.
What a good kid.

2331
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:24,320
Look at that,
but it's go to go to some better ones

2332
01:53:24,321 --> 01:53:26,540
were the ones right next to it in our
dress.

2333
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,120
See down below,
down below,

2334
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:34,790
wherever the photo that you were at sea.
Go to the right there.

2335
01:53:34,791 --> 01:53:36,650
You all pay up.
Oh good Lord.

2336
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:39,440
She just sticking her ass out and every
photo,

2337
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:41,780
she's got that right.
Kind of little sway back thing,

2338
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:43,490
but girls were like,
look at her face.

2339
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,490
Now she's not even that [inaudible].
Guess what girls?

2340
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:51,880
Good enough
here to let you know the ass.

2341
01:53:52,460 --> 01:53:56,480
It trumps all those cheek bones,
all the,

2342
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,160
all the other stuff that you're worried
about.

2343
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,680
I don't know if that's real.
That's a tricky.

2344
01:54:00,740 --> 01:54:03,560
That's a tricky trap for her because
she's just obviously,

2345
01:54:03,620 --> 01:54:06,290
I don't know obviously,
but there's going to be a seduction is

2346
01:54:06,291 --> 01:54:07,690
going to say,
you know,

2347
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:11,070
I define myself by how attractive my ass
is.

2348
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:15,860
Like that's where a lot of she's going.
She's scoring winds and her book based

2349
01:54:15,861 --> 01:54:17,660
upon those instagram followers and
likes.

2350
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:20,570
At a certain point she's going to be a
40,

2351
01:54:20,571 --> 01:54:25,571
50 year old woman in the ass is going to
sag and it's gone or Kurzwell with

2352
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:26,810
fucking science.

2353
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:30,300
Kurzweil figures it all it permanent
giant ass,

2354
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:33,010
but you know,
I think that that's an issue that

2355
01:54:33,050 --> 01:54:37,130
particularly for females is something
that's a problem when you put that much

2356
01:54:37,131 --> 01:54:40,550
emphasis on beauty being and it's not
female's fault,

2357
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:43,790
it's society and everybody's fault.
You put that much emphasis on beauty

2358
01:54:43,791 --> 01:54:47,030
being one of the defining self worth
characteristics.

2359
01:54:47,330 --> 01:54:51,110
Then when that starts to go,
you're in this mad fucking scramble for

2360
01:54:51,111 --> 01:54:55,010
as much surgery as possible to restore
this youth rather than appreciating the

2361
01:54:55,011 --> 01:54:59,060
gifts that each age bring.
Like each aid should bring more wisdom

2362
01:54:59,061 --> 01:55:01,990
and like,
like the older obsolete as like that

2363
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,750
that you see down in the jungle that
have fucking magic that they're able to

2364
01:55:05,751 --> 01:55:06,351
bring like,
yeah,

2365
01:55:06,351 --> 01:55:09,200
I'm not young and beautiful anymore,
but I've lived 65 years.

2366
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:12,380
I'm tuned into my instincts and I can
fucking bring magic.

2367
01:55:12,381 --> 01:55:14,870
I can heal with herbs.
I can do these different things.

2368
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:18,230
That's all well and good,
but their instagram pictures of shit.

2369
01:55:18,530 --> 01:55:21,800
Version Celta pisses on those.
Go Fuck Yourself.

2370
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:25,390
Old Magic Lady in the jungle.
Look at these yoga pants fixtures.

2371
01:55:27,950 --> 01:55:30,290
Fucking yoga pants have revolutionized
the world,

2372
01:55:30,710 --> 01:55:33,800
changed everything changed the game when
you could look at a girl naked without

2373
01:55:33,801 --> 01:55:35,900
her being naked,
but better than naked because it's all

2374
01:55:35,901 --> 01:55:39,230
compressed like it's not.
It's not like you don't see the sloppy

2375
01:55:39,231 --> 01:55:43,070
aspects of skin and flesh and tissue and
deposits.

2376
01:55:43,310 --> 01:55:44,340
Just that beautiful

2377
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:49,200
pressed in shape and that shape is so
deeply ingrained in the human brain.

2378
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:52,880
The colors of a flower,
you know,

2379
01:55:52,881 --> 01:55:56,490
you get your whole legs are all pink.
It's amazing.

2380
01:55:56,491 --> 01:56:00,630
It's a bright pink,
a shocking bright pink or white or like,

2381
01:56:00,631 --> 01:56:02,730
whoa,
it's a white rose,

2382
01:56:02,790 --> 01:56:03,440
right?

2383
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:07,010
Like a total hack in your psyche.
Like the monkeys that have those colored

2384
01:56:07,011 --> 01:56:09,800
butts.
Totally freak out the monkeys out.

2385
01:56:10,820 --> 01:56:15,820
What the fuck is that?
That boone ass fucking goddamn explosion

2386
01:56:17,931 --> 01:56:19,760
of fireworks coming out of their
asshole.

2387
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:22,400
They should be baboons,
yoga pants.

2388
01:56:23,080 --> 01:56:27,890
The most popular yoga pants would maybe
be too much.

2389
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:31,690
It was just all flesh color,
just all normal and then just fold

2390
01:56:31,691 --> 01:56:36,691
baboons.
It would be too much asking too much.

2391
01:56:38,660 --> 01:56:39,300
It's weird.

2392
01:56:39,300 --> 01:56:41,400
Also,
shapes,

2393
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:46,760
shapes become insanely attractive.
Like I was looking at pornography the

2394
01:56:47,011 --> 01:56:51,840
other day and the girl had a natural
body and it's so weird when you see

2395
01:56:51,841 --> 01:56:55,530
natural tits,
big natural tits juggling around.

2396
01:56:55,531 --> 01:56:57,330
She had a natural ass.
I was like,

2397
01:56:57,331 --> 01:56:58,200
wow,
this is fascinating.

2398
01:56:58,201 --> 01:57:00,870
Like these,
these are fat deposits that are very

2399
01:57:00,871 --> 01:57:04,350
attractive because they're.
They're really good when you get

2400
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:05,940
pregnant.
If you're pregnant,

2401
01:57:05,941 --> 01:57:08,130
you should have wide hips.
The baby comes out easier.

2402
01:57:08,310 --> 01:57:12,210
Hip to waist ratio,
hip to waist ratio has been shown by

2403
01:57:12,211 --> 01:57:16,170
scientists to have a drug like effect on
heterosexual males.

2404
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:19,890
Like it literally is a drug.
There's a hip to waist ratio.

2405
01:57:19,891 --> 01:57:24,270
That's almost like when a man sees a
girl with small ways in a big ass

2406
01:57:25,860 --> 01:57:27,800
your your body,
your body just goes,

2407
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:29,240
Eh,
Eh,

2408
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:31,520
Eh,
man on deck man on deck.

2409
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:33,230
Like you're going,
you're about to go to war.

2410
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:37,760
Like it's time to be on your toes.
Like there's a drug and that drug is

2411
01:57:37,761 --> 01:57:39,050
right there.
It's an ass.

2412
01:57:39,180 --> 01:57:41,690
It's an ass and it's a form.
It's a shape.

2413
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:47,080
But if you see someone and she's got the
the back and ass of a Guatemalan

2414
01:57:47,781 --> 01:57:50,420
housekeeper,
you know where they have like that

2415
01:57:50,421 --> 01:57:55,220
really the like the hat,
the ass to weight ratio is nonexistent,

2416
01:57:55,430 --> 01:57:58,520
is a,
a parallel line like the twin towers

2417
01:57:58,521 --> 01:58:01,930
from her shoulders down to her hips and
was with,

2418
01:58:02,360 --> 01:58:04,670
you know,
there's just a weird sort of body and a

2419
01:58:04,671 --> 01:58:08,210
flat ass.
And like for whatever reason that is

2420
01:58:08,211 --> 01:58:11,300
completely unattractive,
she sidestep to a wall.

2421
01:58:11,301 --> 01:58:14,740
All parts would touch at the same time.
You don't want that.

2422
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:16,820
Well,
it's weird like that.

2423
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,880
These shapes have these ingrained the.
They're quantified in our brain,

2424
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,770
like you see these girls in their yoga
pants,

2425
01:58:24,771 --> 01:58:26,840
like that girl that has the millions of
instagram pages.

2426
01:58:27,170 --> 01:58:32,170
If the Guatemalan housekeeper with her
big wide back in her flat ass had the

2427
01:58:32,541 --> 01:58:34,790
same poses,
like nobody would care.

2428
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:38,840
We need what we're looking for certain
shapes.

2429
01:58:39,110 --> 01:58:40,910
Yeah.
There was even a theory that,

2430
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:42,130
you know,
the reason

2431
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,950
why people like cleavage and I don't
know if this theory is accurate,

2432
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:49,951
but that cleavage actually reminds our
brain of what a butt crack looks like.

2433
01:58:51,790 --> 01:58:55,120
And so that's one of the reasons why
it's sexually attractive to males.

2434
01:58:55,510 --> 01:59:00,510
That shape of those lumps of fat pushed
together in that kind of format is like

2435
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:03,760
a trick into our brain where it's like,
oh,

2436
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:06,250
an ass on the chest.
That makes sense.

2437
01:59:06,310 --> 01:59:08,230
Kind of.
But it also makes sense that,

2438
01:59:08,231 --> 01:59:09,550
you know,
if the tits are that big,

2439
01:59:09,551 --> 01:59:10,930
they're touching together and once you
were released,

2440
01:59:10,931 --> 01:59:15,820
those mamas pop that snap on the Bra and
they come out to play.

2441
01:59:15,821 --> 01:59:18,370
Whoa.
It's another bizarre one.

2442
01:59:18,371 --> 01:59:21,340
Like tits or magic.
They are fucking magical.

2443
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:25,270
Nipples are magic when they get hard,
when you're sucking on a nipple and it

2444
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:29,260
gets erect like that is a magic moment.
There's something exciting about that.

2445
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:32,950
Yup.
It's a fucking cool world we live in.

2446
01:59:32,951 --> 01:59:35,500
You know,
I sometimes think like if we were all

2447
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:39,370
just consciousness and more in reality
didn't exist in this world,

2448
01:59:39,371 --> 01:59:40,990
didn't exist,
and we were like,

2449
01:59:40,991 --> 01:59:41,830
man,
what should we do?

2450
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:43,870
Well,
let's create the fucking coolest video

2451
01:59:43,871 --> 01:59:45,250
game ever.
You know,

2452
01:59:45,251 --> 01:59:49,420
something that has lots of boss battles
and challenges and different things you

2453
01:59:49,421 --> 01:59:52,660
can do and you can have sex and it feels
amazing and you can accumulate things

2454
01:59:52,661 --> 01:59:56,140
and you interact with other players.
It's like the most massive multiplayer

2455
01:59:56,141 --> 01:59:59,320
online experience possible and like,
yeah,

2456
01:59:59,321 --> 02:00:00,310
let's do that.
Oh,

2457
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:03,310
I got an idea.
Let's make it so that you think it's

2458
02:00:03,311 --> 02:00:05,770
totally real when you're playing the
game,

2459
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:07,990
you don't know it's a game.
And then it was like,

2460
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:10,240
fuck yeah,
that game is even better.

2461
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:13,180
And I kind of feel like that's really
what we're doing here.

2462
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:18,180
We're in this like the best possible
video game that we could create and it's

2463
02:00:18,371 --> 02:00:22,210
so good because we think it's fully real
and it's such a good game that we can

2464
02:00:22,211 --> 02:00:26,410
create mini games within the game and
actually play video games in our video

2465
02:00:26,411 --> 02:00:31,411
game and those are awesome too.
Know it's like the most crazy thing that

2466
02:00:31,841 --> 02:00:33,750
we've done and then we get back,
you know,

2467
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:35,860
and in my believe that,
you know,

2468
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:39,280
when we're done with this experience,
we get back and we get to look and go,

2469
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:41,410
wow,
that was a crazy fucking turn.

2470
02:00:41,650 --> 02:00:43,630
And then get to decide like,
yeah,

2471
02:00:43,631 --> 02:00:44,740
let's go again.
Let's do it.

2472
02:00:44,741 --> 02:00:46,210
Let's play in this world,
you know,

2473
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:47,730
earth world.
And maybe there's another world.

2474
02:00:47,731 --> 02:00:49,840
I don't know if there is,
but maybe there's another world and you

2475
02:00:49,841 --> 02:00:51,100
can say,
Oh man,

2476
02:00:51,101 --> 02:00:53,530
that's playing that fucking world.
That world looks fun.

2477
02:00:53,920 --> 02:00:55,600
You know,
and there's just this opportunity.

2478
02:00:55,601 --> 02:01:00,601
And I think at least even having that
perspective really gets me to appreciate

2479
02:01:00,641 --> 02:01:01,870
this even more like,
yeah,

2480
02:01:01,871 --> 02:01:04,630
there's struggles,
but every video game is going to have

2481
02:01:04,631 --> 02:01:06,970
those struggles.
It's gonna have that thing where you can

2482
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,370
barely beat it and it takes you a long
time.

2483
02:01:09,371 --> 02:01:12,490
That's like a good game.
It's like it's just challenging enough

2484
02:01:12,491 --> 02:01:15,880
where if you apply yourself completely
and you're at the edge of your skill,

2485
02:01:16,120 --> 02:01:17,120
you can win.
Otherwise,

2486
02:01:17,121 --> 02:01:18,340
if it's too easy,
it's not fun.

2487
02:01:18,341 --> 02:01:20,050
You throw that fucking game away real
quick.

2488
02:01:20,750 --> 02:01:22,010
Yeah.
Yeah.

2489
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,910
Unless you live in the Congo,
then you game sucks and your game,

2490
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:27,730
you're in a level that's really too
hard.

2491
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:33,210
Blows get parasites and malaria and
fucking war lords.

2492
02:01:33,551 --> 02:01:36,190
Shit.
This game's dogs playing halo with a

2493
02:01:36,191 --> 02:01:39,260
bunch of professionals that just fucking
headshot you all day like I

2494
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:41,830
can't even play.
Yeah,

2495
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:45,140
well,
I'm fascinated by simulation theory.

2496
02:01:45,340 --> 02:01:50,240
I'm fascinated by the fact that there's
actual physicists that are bantering and

2497
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:55,750
throwing around this idea that it is
possible that at one time in the future,

2498
02:01:56,750 --> 02:01:59,150
in the near future,
perhaps like within the next 20 or 30

2499
02:01:59,151 --> 02:02:01,610
years even,
that they're going to be able to create

2500
02:02:01,611 --> 02:02:04,730
an artificial reality that's
indistinguishable from the reality we're

2501
02:02:04,731 --> 02:02:08,150
currently experiencing.
You are going to be able to enter into a

2502
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:11,590
fake world,
whether it's through some sort of a a

2503
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:16,160
chip that they can put into your mind or
whether it's some sort of a virtual

2504
02:02:16,161 --> 02:02:21,161
reality headset that you put on that
allows you to interface with some sort

2505
02:02:21,561 --> 02:02:25,010
of computer stimulation.
That's it makes it indistinguishable

2506
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:27,380
from reality.
We're currently experiencing that.

2507
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:32,000
We're going to come to a point in time
where it gets so good you can't tell if

2508
02:02:32,001 --> 02:02:35,240
it's really not,
so how do we know if we're not already

2509
02:02:35,241 --> 02:02:36,050
in it?

2510
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:40,610
How do we know?
How do we know if that isn't the entire

2511
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:44,330
process?
Being some sort of bizarre fractal thing

2512
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:48,890
like that.
From the time a cell divides into two

2513
02:02:48,891 --> 02:02:52,310
cells,
becomes a multicellular organism,

2514
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:55,580
becomes a more complex multicellular
organism,

2515
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:59,480
become sentient,
becomes something that's creative,

2516
02:02:59,510 --> 02:03:01,430
become something that's not just
creative,

2517
02:03:01,510 --> 02:03:05,930
but can manipulate its environment,
has articulating fingers that change the

2518
02:03:05,931 --> 02:03:09,980
atmosphere around it,
changed the physical world in which it

2519
02:03:09,981 --> 02:03:11,960
lives,
alter the weather,

2520
02:03:12,170 --> 02:03:17,170
alter the structure of the things that
are around them and then gets to the

2521
02:03:17,481 --> 02:03:22,481
point where creates an artificial world,
creates a world that's so complex and so

2522
02:03:24,021 --> 02:03:27,170
bizarre that it only exists in ones and
zeroes,

2523
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:31,490
but is indistinguishable when you
interface with it,

2524
02:03:31,790 --> 02:03:33,440
that when you interface with it there as
well,

2525
02:03:33,441 --> 02:03:35,810
is that a real world?
Who's to say it's not?

2526
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:37,610
Who's to say your worlds real?

2527
02:03:37,790 --> 02:03:42,650
If you get deep into your world,
if you go deep into the subatomic realm,

2528
02:03:42,651 --> 02:03:46,700
what is that?
It's all fucking space and and magic.

2529
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,970
When you get into the world of subatomic
particles.

2530
02:03:49,971 --> 02:03:53,930
I have tried so hard to understand.
I've watched lectures and listen to

2531
02:03:53,931 --> 02:03:58,931
people give speeches about quantum
theory and about the interaction of

2532
02:03:59,781 --> 02:04:03,680
subatomic particles.
Particles that are in superposition,

2533
02:04:03,950 --> 02:04:06,950
which means they're still and moving at
the same time.

2534
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:10,730
There was one of two possible outcomes.
They blink in and out of existence.

2535
02:04:10,731 --> 02:04:13,910
Observance of them is what decides which
one they are.

2536
02:04:13,940 --> 02:04:15,080
That's crazy.
Well,

2537
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:19,280
how about the fact that they go away and
we don't know where they go and then

2538
02:04:19,281 --> 02:04:23,360
they reemerge somewhere else.
They blink in and out of existence so we

2539
02:04:23,361 --> 02:04:27,020
have no explanation for it based on our
current understanding or a current

2540
02:04:27,021 --> 02:04:28,760
ability to measure what's happening.

2541
02:04:29,450 --> 02:04:33,530
Maybe that'll get more complex and I'll
have some more answers in the future

2542
02:04:33,531 --> 02:04:35,690
when they get better at figuring this
stuff out,

2543
02:04:35,930 --> 02:04:38,610
but the current understanding of
subatomic particles when they get into

2544
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:42,120
things like superposition is like you're
dealing with magic.

2545
02:04:42,300 --> 02:04:45,510
You're dealing with something that
literally if you.

2546
02:04:45,511 --> 02:04:48,750
If you.
If it didn't exist and you tried to say,

2547
02:04:48,900 --> 02:04:50,760
Hey,
I'm going to create something that

2548
02:04:50,761 --> 02:04:54,630
exists and doesn't exist as something
that's moving and still I'm going to

2549
02:04:54,631 --> 02:04:58,860
create something that's here and then it
goes away and we don't know where it is

2550
02:04:58,861 --> 02:05:01,260
and it comes back in another place.
People would go,

2551
02:05:01,261 --> 02:05:02,970
shut the fuck up,
just shut up.

2552
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,910
You're talking about nonsense,
but that's not nonsense.

2553
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:08,040
That's subatomic particles.
These are.

2554
02:05:08,041 --> 02:05:12,640
This is.
This is a real acceptable aspect of of

2555
02:05:12,690 --> 02:05:15,330
the scientific method.
They've gotten down to this,

2556
02:05:15,600 --> 02:05:18,630
they've examined this and this is
accepted across the board,

2557
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:20,460
but these people that study it,
well,

2558
02:05:20,461 --> 02:05:21,330
what does that even.

2559
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:26,750
How is that more real than this
simulation that someone's created with

2560
02:05:27,031 --> 02:05:31,080
the computer that makes you feel like
you really are running from dinosaurs in

2561
02:05:31,081 --> 02:05:34,110
Jurassic Park,
you feel the wet leaves under your bare

2562
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:37,110
feet as you're sprinting away from a
fucking raptor.

2563
02:05:37,380 --> 02:05:39,360
How did.
How has that more real?

2564
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:43,950
What is real and what is not real?
That's going to get real fuzzy.

2565
02:05:44,100 --> 02:05:47,580
That's going to get real strange when
you have to define reality.

2566
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:52,820
When you know that this desk that I'm
hitting on is filled with Adams and

2567
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:57,420
those inside those atoms.
It's mostly space.

2568
02:05:57,990 --> 02:06:00,720
We don't understand why there's so much
empty space,

2569
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:03,390
but what is in there like?
Why is it hard?

2570
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:05,370
Like why?
How come when I knock on this?

2571
02:06:05,371 --> 02:06:08,040
It's hard,
but when I put my hand through water,

2572
02:06:08,150 --> 02:06:11,040
it doesn't water of Adam's to like
what's going on here,

2573
02:06:11,190 --> 02:06:13,830
like what,
what is real and what's not real or are

2574
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:18,060
definitions of what's real and what's
not real or what can I put on a scale?

2575
02:06:18,180 --> 02:06:20,490
What can I put a ruler across and
measure,

2576
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:21,370
you know,
what,

2577
02:06:21,370 --> 02:06:23,040
how am I,
what can I sell you?

2578
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:27,420
What can I put a barcode on and package
it and sell it at whole foods?

2579
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,610
What is,
what is real and what's not real?

2580
02:06:30,160 --> 02:06:35,160
I think that the way that in my
explorations go in as deep as I possibly

2581
02:06:35,411 --> 02:06:39,040
can,
which is where I generally turn first,

2582
02:06:39,041 --> 02:06:41,920
is the way that I've understand that
understood it,

2583
02:06:41,921 --> 02:06:46,921
is that collectively we did create kind
of a simulation and at least in my own

2584
02:06:47,150 --> 02:06:48,490
experiences,
you know,

2585
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:50,890
illuminated in my own imagination
perhaps,

2586
02:06:51,220 --> 02:06:55,690
but collectively we did create a
simulation and that simulation was led

2587
02:06:55,691 --> 02:06:56,770
by,
you know,

2588
02:06:56,830 --> 02:06:58,630
just intent.
The desire to say,

2589
02:06:58,660 --> 02:06:59,740
yeah,
let's do this.

2590
02:06:59,770 --> 02:07:02,080
Let's have,
let's have a physical manifest.

2591
02:07:02,081 --> 02:07:06,220
Let's have things that we can knock our
knuckles on and have this opportunity to

2592
02:07:06,221 --> 02:07:09,400
do it collectively as that,
as that unified force,

2593
02:07:09,401 --> 02:07:13,690
kind of like the one voice in our body
that collectively makes decisions even

2594
02:07:13,691 --> 02:07:16,810
though we have all of these other
organisms all vying for different

2595
02:07:16,811 --> 02:07:17,650
things.
Collectively.

2596
02:07:17,651 --> 02:07:22,570
There was a yes and then there was like
an intelligence in place led by the

2597
02:07:22,571 --> 02:07:23,440
sacred geometry.

2598
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,410
That very quantum stuff that makes
things stuff.

2599
02:07:26,830 --> 02:07:31,830
Then that artificial intelligence
created the perfect solution for that

2600
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:36,010
initial intent which led and then
ultimately leading us and maybe other

2601
02:07:36,011 --> 02:07:41,011
sentient beings who could potentially
create other worlds downstream as well,

2602
02:07:42,270 --> 02:07:44,410
you know,
and it could just continue with creating

2603
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:49,030
other and then eventually those sentient
beings that have been created from the

2604
02:07:49,031 --> 02:07:52,900
intent and allowing rules like
artificial intelligence or sacred

2605
02:07:52,901 --> 02:07:54,940
geometry.
Allowing those rules to create the world

2606
02:07:54,941 --> 02:07:56,470
perfectly.
Because if you're actually trying to

2607
02:07:56,471 --> 02:07:58,750
program that Shit's too complex.
Not Possible.

2608
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,360
But if you have rules in place like all
right,

2609
02:08:01,361 --> 02:08:04,270
this artificial intelligence,
we'll figure it out according to these

2610
02:08:04,271 --> 02:08:07,120
different laws of evolution and
reproduction will make these things

2611
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:09,160
combined together in certain ways.
And,

2612
02:08:09,430 --> 02:08:11,290
and that's,
that's the rules of the system and it

2613
02:08:11,291 --> 02:08:14,860
will flourish in a certain way that will
survive until eventually there'll be

2614
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:15,920
other,
you know,

2615
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:17,380
God,
so to speak,

2616
02:08:17,381 --> 02:08:21,490
these other sentient beings that then
couldn't create eventually downstream

2617
02:08:21,491 --> 02:08:25,870
worlds when their ability to create
artificial intelligence in these other

2618
02:08:25,871 --> 02:08:29,680
rules will happen and that can go to
infinity,

2619
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,920
you know,
and we may be somewhere in that infinity

2620
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:34,690
of,
you know,

2621
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:39,760
and it just goes on forever and that's
this mind blowing kind of thing where

2622
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:41,680
you're like,
Holy Shit,

2623
02:08:41,770 --> 02:08:44,110
you know,
like we could be in a simulation that's

2624
02:08:44,111 --> 02:08:47,470
part of a simulation,
going to create another simulation,

2625
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:48,810
you know,
like we're,

2626
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:51,610
we're our own universe in the
multiverse,

2627
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:56,110
creating a micro verse which is a
universe and it's own multiverse and

2628
02:08:56,111 --> 02:08:57,490
just,
it just goes on forever.

2629
02:08:57,790 --> 02:08:59,230
Just like that.
We're not even high.

2630
02:09:00,130 --> 02:09:02,770
We're sober stone cold sober.
These full console owners.

2631
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:04,180
No,
incorrect.

2632
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:07,510
I have a theory about artificial
intelligence.

2633
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:10,510
I think the idea is very flawed.
The premise is flawed.

2634
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:12,880
It is intelligence.
It's not artificial.

2635
02:09:12,881 --> 02:09:16,540
What's artificial?
It's created on earth with materials.

2636
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:20,290
Why is it natural?
It's created with come and it's not

2637
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:24,490
natural if it's created with silicon
chips and it doesn't make any sense like

2638
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:27,250
it is intelligence,
but it's intelligence that's not

2639
02:09:27,251 --> 02:09:32,251
biological in origin in the sense of
it's not based on the cellular structure

2640
02:09:32,951 --> 02:09:37,660
that all biological entities on earth
possess.

2641
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:42,750
Like it's something that's made with
human beings manipulating the raw

2642
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:46,600
materials of the earth and creating
something through programming,

2643
02:09:46,930 --> 02:09:47,860
through,
uh,

2644
02:09:47,861 --> 02:09:50,740
you know,
where the fuck they make computers.

2645
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:54,940
Whatever processes are involved that
creates this intelligence,

2646
02:09:54,941 --> 02:09:57,850
but it's not artificial at all.
It's 100 percent real.

2647
02:09:58,040 --> 02:09:58,873
You know,
if you eat,

2648
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:02,710
like my kids have a kitchen set and eat
one of their fake tomatoes,

2649
02:10:02,760 --> 02:10:05,500
you're eating a fucking piece of plastic
that's an artificial tomato.

2650
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:09,490
That's hard official.
This is not artificial intelligence.

2651
02:10:09,491 --> 02:10:12,430
It's actual intelligence,
but it's intelligence is created by

2652
02:10:12,431 --> 02:10:17,290
people that have manipulated the raw
materials of earth and then looked at

2653
02:10:17,291 --> 02:10:21,760
their own shortcomings and sort of
modeled this idea of a future being

2654
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:26,530
based on correcting what they see is
wrong with themselves.

2655
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:30,130
But in doing so,
what are we gonna?

2656
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:35,280
What are we going to do to what we are?
I mean that's the big fear of artificial

2657
02:10:35,301 --> 02:10:37,340
intelligence is if we create something
better than us,

2658
02:10:37,490 --> 02:10:39,900
we have to come to the realization that
we are.

2659
02:10:39,901 --> 02:10:44,060
It's so flawed that we cannot be
repaired.

2660
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:48,200
Like the idea of coming in people and
getting them pregnant and then a baby

2661
02:10:48,201 --> 02:10:52,460
comes out of their pussy and then
someone comes in that baby and you know

2662
02:10:52,461 --> 02:10:55,850
when they become an adult and that the
baby has a baby that comes out of their

2663
02:10:55,851 --> 02:10:58,010
pussy and then we see that's the only
way we do it.

2664
02:10:58,340 --> 02:10:59,420
That's it.
It's the only way.

2665
02:10:59,421 --> 02:11:02,600
It's the way it's been because the
future is the past is no,

2666
02:11:02,601 --> 02:11:03,950
it's not.
It's not.

2667
02:11:03,980 --> 02:11:08,330
It is a way to get to the point where we
create these beings that are far

2668
02:11:08,331 --> 02:11:12,500
superior than the what our biology is
capable of making.

2669
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:16,460
I think you may be right,
but I think we're in this hurry to do it

2670
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:18,200
when I think we should just be like,
man,

2671
02:11:18,201 --> 02:11:20,660
this is the fucking golden age.
Genitals aren't going to be around

2672
02:11:20,661 --> 02:11:21,930
forever.
Like,

2673
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:24,320
let's enjoy the shit out of this right
now.

2674
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:28,070
Like I really feel like we're in this
transition point where we still have

2675
02:11:28,071 --> 02:11:31,400
those base or animal instincts that no
fucking good,

2676
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:35,300
but eventually I think you're right.
We will transition out with whatever

2677
02:11:35,301 --> 02:11:40,180
Kinda Kurzweilian ways that we can
transcend death and you know,

2678
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,190
have different reproduction done in
different way.

2679
02:11:43,190 --> 02:11:46,310
Like those grey aliens with no genitals,
you know,

2680
02:11:46,690 --> 02:11:49,370
and these different ideas of,
of a different way to do it.

2681
02:11:49,371 --> 02:11:52,010
But you know,
those guys are looking at us like,

2682
02:11:52,250 --> 02:11:53,880
man,
that must be fucking fun.

2683
02:11:54,250 --> 02:11:55,600
You know,
there's some shitty fights,

2684
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:58,250
but it's fun.
You could still get a muscle car.

2685
02:11:58,251 --> 02:12:01,910
They're still legal before they get to
this point where they're just going to

2686
02:12:01,911 --> 02:12:06,911
be these fucking automotive.
These cars are going to be all automated

2687
02:12:07,521 --> 02:12:09,380
and everything's going to be self
driven.

2688
02:12:09,381 --> 02:12:11,180
There's going to be no excitement to
that.

2689
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:14,210
And then there's gonna be no sex.
People are going to figure out a way to

2690
02:12:14,211 --> 02:12:18,950
make the same feeling that you get from
sex available on your command.

2691
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:21,440
You know?
Have you ever been in the hospital and

2692
02:12:21,441 --> 02:12:23,540
they give you one,
those morphine drips when you.

2693
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:28,640
I got my knees operated on back in the
nineties and it was the real painful

2694
02:12:29,481 --> 02:12:31,460
method where they do the Patella tendon
graft,

2695
02:12:31,461 --> 02:12:34,700
so they cut a piece of bone out of your
Shin and take a strip out of your

2696
02:12:34,701 --> 02:12:38,870
patella tendon and they take a chunk of
the bone and your Shin and they open you

2697
02:12:38,871 --> 02:12:43,871
up like a fish and then replace your acl
with this piece of your Patella is

2698
02:12:44,181 --> 02:12:45,014
painful as fuck.

2699
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,190
And so when you're in the hospital they
immediately put you on this motion

2700
02:12:49,191 --> 02:12:52,100
machine and this motion machine.
Your legs sits on this thing and it

2701
02:12:52,101 --> 02:12:56,000
constantly bends and straightens.
Bends and straight and spends is right

2702
02:12:56,001 --> 02:12:58,970
after the surgery,
like immediately after and then they

2703
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:01,800
give you this morphine button and every
time you hit that bitch

2704
02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:09,710
you just get just stoked up with
morphine and it's amazing.

2705
02:13:09,711 --> 02:13:10,500
You just sit.
There you go,

2706
02:13:10,500 --> 02:13:13,130
Woo.
So the only time I've ever done quote

2707
02:13:13,131 --> 02:13:14,630
unquote morphine,
I've known,

2708
02:13:14,660 --> 02:13:16,730
I've never experienced like opiates
before.

2709
02:13:16,760 --> 02:13:19,070
Other than that,
and it was fucking wild.

2710
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:19,790
I was like,
Ooh,

2711
02:13:19,790 --> 02:13:21,650
good thing.
This isn't available all the time,

2712
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:26,540
but we could easily get to a point
sometime in the future where the idea of

2713
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:31,500
going on tinder to try to find someone
to fuck is outrageously stupid.

2714
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:31,980
Why

2715
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,210
would you do that when you can just like
how you plug in your phone to recharge

2716
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:37,510
it.
You're going to plug in and

2717
02:13:39,810 --> 02:13:42,860
experiencing like the love of the mother
Gaia,

2718
02:13:43,070 --> 02:13:46,020
like,
like the swarming fractal.

2719
02:13:46,021 --> 02:13:49,140
Love that you get an a dmt experience,
pure.

2720
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:54,430
Just pure pleasure and pure experience
of,

2721
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:59,580
of just understanding and affection and
all of it wrapped up in this warm,

2722
02:14:01,020 --> 02:14:05,100
beautiful accepting,
embrace or you know,

2723
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:07,140
I told you this and you went and did
that,

2724
02:14:07,141 --> 02:14:08,700
and then I was like,
fuck you and you if I can,

2725
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:10,740
you might fucking cheap my friends.
My friends tell me,

2726
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:12,210
you know,
my friend Cheryl says,

2727
02:14:12,460 --> 02:14:14,180
Nah,
Nah,

2728
02:14:14,190 --> 02:14:15,440
Nah,
I don't want to do it anymore.

2729
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:17,940
You don't have to do it anymore.
And then because of the fact that people

2730
02:14:17,941 --> 02:14:19,590
kept doing this over and over and over
again,

2731
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:23,220
our dicks has shrunk and shriveled up
inside of our bodies.

2732
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:26,190
And then we become those gray aliens.
That's what we become.

2733
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:29,220
We ruin our atmosphere to the point
where we have built in sunglasses,

2734
02:14:29,221 --> 02:14:33,210
those big goddamn black eyes.
Our heads become huge because we use

2735
02:14:33,211 --> 02:14:34,620
telekinesis now.
Uh,

2736
02:14:34,730 --> 02:14:37,080
we don't want them to need muscles
because we don't pick anything up

2737
02:14:37,081 --> 02:14:38,820
anymore.
And if you look at our muscles in

2738
02:14:38,821 --> 02:14:40,530
comparison to a champ,
you know,

2739
02:14:40,531 --> 02:14:43,260
look at the,
you've seen those photos are of chimps

2740
02:14:43,261 --> 02:14:47,070
with mange hairless champs and like
Jesus Christ will,

2741
02:14:47,071 --> 02:14:51,030
they have to have muscles like that.
It's how they get the trend is clear,

2742
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:52,530
you know,
which way we're going.

2743
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:55,620
Great.
He's just now is an opportunity to just

2744
02:14:55,621 --> 02:14:58,680
really enjoy the shit out of it because
they know because it's going to go,

2745
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:00,360
you know,
I think at some point,

2746
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:03,540
and you know,
I mean there will be some good aspects

2747
02:15:03,541 --> 02:15:04,260
of that,
you know,

2748
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:07,320
I think for sure there'll be generally
some less suffering.

2749
02:15:07,320 --> 02:15:11,160
But this is if I had to choose what
level of the video game I want to play,

2750
02:15:11,161 --> 02:15:12,850
like I'm going to be here now.
Yeah.

2751
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:15,300
This is,
this is the cool time for me.

2752
02:15:15,301 --> 02:15:17,520
And,
and there are ways to do that.

2753
02:15:17,521 --> 02:15:19,290
I mean,
I think we think of it technologically,

2754
02:15:19,291 --> 02:15:21,960
but I think at the plants as a
technology,

2755
02:15:21,961 --> 02:15:26,961
like smoking dmt is a technology.
It's just a way to administer dmt

2756
02:15:27,391 --> 02:15:31,230
molecules that don't get broken down
immediately because there's such a flood

2757
02:15:31,470 --> 02:15:35,130
that it actually crosses the blood brain
barrier and you have that experience of

2758
02:15:35,131 --> 02:15:37,860
swirling guy,
you know,

2759
02:15:37,861 --> 02:15:40,980
and it's just like looking at that like
this is tech,

2760
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:42,870
this isn't,
this is drugs,

2761
02:15:42,980 --> 02:15:44,550
you know,
this is technology.

2762
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:46,140
It's a weird word though.
Technology,

2763
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:47,670
we think about metal.
Yeah,

2764
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:51,870
we do wires.
But really to me that's a better way to

2765
02:15:51,871 --> 02:15:52,681
look at it,
you know,

2766
02:15:52,681 --> 02:15:54,780
because drugs carry all these
connotations.

2767
02:15:54,780 --> 02:15:58,590
And I was at a cure for this.
It's just this is a technology that

2768
02:15:58,591 --> 02:16:02,520
allows this certain element of humanity
to unlock.

2769
02:16:02,521 --> 02:16:05,310
It's like a key to a lock and you hit
that right.

2770
02:16:05,580 --> 02:16:06,413
It's good.
It's not.

2771
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:09,510
You don't always want to unlock all the
doors either though,

2772
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:11,880
you know,
I mean in my recent experience,

2773
02:16:11,881 --> 02:16:14,340
I pushed it,
pushed it to a level where I could

2774
02:16:14,341 --> 02:16:18,480
really see like fuck.
Like you could get down into some weird,

2775
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:21,120
weird waters where you're entering a
lot,

2776
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:23,370
you know,
and you don't really know if you're

2777
02:16:23,371 --> 02:16:24,690
going to come back,
you know,

2778
02:16:24,691 --> 02:16:25,710
and,
and so I,

2779
02:16:25,711 --> 02:16:28,260
I definitely,
I announced on my own podcast was like,

2780
02:16:28,261 --> 02:16:30,010
look,
I'm done with that

2781
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:33,280
type of exploration of the plants.
I just want to play,

2782
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:38,320
hang out and experience them for fun.
But going intentionally that deep with

2783
02:16:38,321 --> 02:16:39,280
them,
you know,

2784
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:40,930
you have to be,
you have to have caution.

2785
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,330
Plus it's a predatory universe out
there.

2786
02:16:43,331 --> 02:16:45,370
You know,
a lot of these Iowaska shamans and a lot

2787
02:16:45,371 --> 02:16:47,560
of these things,
they don't always have your best

2788
02:16:47,561 --> 02:16:49,150
interests.
They come from the jungle where the

2789
02:16:49,151 --> 02:16:51,440
strong eat the weak.
That's what people gotta realize.

2790
02:16:51,441 --> 02:16:55,240
Like in the jungle,
the strongest Jaguar eats all things.

2791
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:57,670
All these Shamans,
their head animal,

2792
02:16:57,850 --> 02:17:01,000
most of moons.
Toronto is the Jaguar who eats all

2793
02:17:01,001 --> 02:17:04,060
things.
Like you got to realize like a lot of

2794
02:17:04,061 --> 02:17:07,060
those motherfuckers you're trying to eat
you like they're trying to eat you.

2795
02:17:07,061 --> 02:17:10,630
So be really super careful with it.
But look at it,

2796
02:17:10,631 --> 02:17:11,740
you know,
without bias,

2797
02:17:11,741 --> 02:17:15,400
look at it like this is a technology,
is this technology going to be useful

2798
02:17:15,401 --> 02:17:18,010
for me?
Am I ready to explore this technology?

2799
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:20,950
If so,
do it appropriately and responsibly and

2800
02:17:20,951 --> 02:17:22,300
it can be really,
really valuable.

2801
02:17:22,330 --> 02:17:25,120
But then no one that technology's no
longer serving you,

2802
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:28,760
isn't it one of those things like we've
been talking about where there's no,

2803
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:32,450
it's not a clear good or bad,
there's not a clear yes or no.

2804
02:17:32,451 --> 02:17:33,231
There's not like,
oh,

2805
02:17:33,231 --> 02:17:36,230
well if you meet a showman,
he will absolutely be pure.

2806
02:17:36,930 --> 02:17:38,070
No,
fuck no,

2807
02:17:38,190 --> 02:17:39,440
no,
not at all.

2808
02:17:39,530 --> 02:17:41,810
I mean there's just a mixed bag just
like puke.

2809
02:17:41,850 --> 02:17:44,480
It's like any human,
is this going to be a good guy or bad

2810
02:17:44,481 --> 02:17:46,940
guys can be someone's helpful or not
helpful.

2811
02:17:46,941 --> 02:17:49,190
That's why stereotypes are so fucking
problematic.

2812
02:17:49,550 --> 02:17:51,110
You know,
if you meet a girl and she's beautiful,

2813
02:17:51,111 --> 02:17:52,800
you assume she's dummy,
right?

2814
02:17:53,250 --> 02:17:55,190
You know what I mean?
That's the standard,

2815
02:17:55,191 --> 02:17:56,840
right?
Because beautiful people don't have to

2816
02:17:56,841 --> 02:18:00,170
try as hard as soon as she's taking it
easy and she slacked off.

2817
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:04,460
It's just a lot of people meet these
people from indigenous cultures and say,

2818
02:18:04,490 --> 02:18:05,780
oh,
they're indigenous.

2819
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:09,410
One Slash 16th,
native American,

2820
02:18:09,770 --> 02:18:10,603
spiritual,
right?

2821
02:18:10,700 --> 02:18:13,100
He's got extra magic and he's in
medicine.

2822
02:18:13,130 --> 02:18:15,110
Man's.
He made the barefoot.

2823
02:18:16,010 --> 02:18:19,070
He may just be trying to fuck everybody
in his village and take your money.

2824
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:24,280
Other people who are genuinely like
Gandalf,

2825
02:18:24,281 --> 02:18:25,690
the white wizard where you're like,
fuck,

2826
02:18:25,691 --> 02:18:28,120
that's Gandalf.
The white wizard I just encountered and

2827
02:18:28,121 --> 02:18:30,250
it's awesome,
but it's just you got to use your

2828
02:18:30,251 --> 02:18:31,840
instincts.
You gotta be you gotTa.

2829
02:18:31,841 --> 02:18:35,380
Be Keen to the situation and know what
you're getting into because it's a.

2830
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:39,880
it's a crazy wild world that we know
very little about compared to,

2831
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:41,740
you know,
these external technology.

2832
02:18:42,040 --> 02:18:45,190
Well also the fact that it's been
suppressed has become such a huge issue

2833
02:18:45,191 --> 02:18:48,010
that we have to go to these South
American countries to get it.

2834
02:18:48,370 --> 02:18:49,061
It's not like,
look,

2835
02:18:49,061 --> 02:18:52,720
if you want to go to get a massage,
you can go to Burke Williams and I

2836
02:18:52,721 --> 02:18:55,720
guarantee you they will give you an
excellent massage by a qualified

2837
02:18:55,721 --> 02:18:57,340
technician.
No one's going to fucking rob your

2838
02:18:57,341 --> 02:18:58,600
wallet.
You know what?

2839
02:18:58,610 --> 02:19:00,700
They have established a business and an
ethic.

2840
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:03,550
There's a lot of places like that where
you go and you can,

2841
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:06,130
you know,
you can go and experience a really good

2842
02:19:06,131 --> 02:19:08,620
service because it's legal in because we
don't,

2843
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:11,050
we don't.
There's no consequences for engaging in

2844
02:19:11,051 --> 02:19:13,510
that action,
but the consequences of the United

2845
02:19:13,510 --> 02:19:17,650
States are so extreme that people have
to fly to the fucking jungle to take

2846
02:19:17,651 --> 02:19:20,570
something that your own brain produces.
It's.

2847
02:19:20,600 --> 02:19:23,620
It's so weird.
It's so weird that there's these

2848
02:19:23,650 --> 02:19:28,160
destinations that you have to go to to
explore that your

2849
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:32,900
own fucking pineal gland produces,
and the only reason why is because we

2850
02:19:32,901 --> 02:19:34,730
make it illegal here in the United
States.

2851
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:37,340
They should have calabasas IOWASCA
centers.

2852
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:41,000
We should be able to go right down the
street from Kim Kardashians House and

2853
02:19:41,001 --> 02:19:43,030
get fucking fueled up,
but we,

2854
02:19:43,050 --> 02:19:45,660
we,
we're not there yet and if who knows

2855
02:19:45,661 --> 02:19:48,110
what we're ever going to get there.
It seems to me though that that's the

2856
02:19:48,111 --> 02:19:49,700
trend it seems.
Yeah,

2857
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:51,800
right.
Definitely in so many different ways.

2858
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:55,970
There's all these ponies in the race.
I was pretty much there with a religious

2859
02:19:55,971 --> 02:19:58,280
exemption,
like was that church that just opened up

2860
02:19:58,281 --> 02:19:59,960
in Washington?
Don't recommend it.

2861
02:19:59,961 --> 02:20:01,760
From what I've seen,
obviously haven't been there,

2862
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,550
but again,
there's a very select group that I.

2863
02:20:04,551 --> 02:20:06,130
What is the church in Washington?
What is there?

2864
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:09,870
It's a nondenominational IOWASCA church.
So the Church has Santa Diamond.

2865
02:20:09,880 --> 02:20:13,310
That church of UDV.
I'm already got religious exemption

2866
02:20:13,311 --> 02:20:16,430
approval cream court by the supreme
court twice.

2867
02:20:16,480 --> 02:20:17,060
Yeah,
right.

2868
02:20:17,060 --> 02:20:21,370
So one more time and you know,
it's fully like everything is going to

2869
02:20:21,440 --> 02:20:23,390
be a good.
They're doing full Iowa.

2870
02:20:23,430 --> 02:20:27,200
Rick Strassman Ios.
Rick strassman did it with them and he's

2871
02:20:27,201 --> 02:20:29,740
like,
they were these golf shirts like they

2872
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:34,800
have like a little outfit and they're
getting blasted with like insanely

2873
02:20:35,061 --> 02:20:38,570
powerful IOWASCA and they're singing
songs about Jesus.

2874
02:20:39,310 --> 02:20:42,490
Then that's the weird part.
So I'll sing songs about Jesus if you

2875
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:45,980
get me high enough.
So then the church in Washington was

2876
02:20:45,981 --> 02:20:46,550
like,
fuck it,

2877
02:20:46,550 --> 02:20:49,310
we're going to be nondenominational so
we're not going to sing songs about

2878
02:20:49,311 --> 02:20:50,720
Jesus,
we're just going to be a church.

2879
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:53,300
And so we're waiting to kind of see what
happens with that.

2880
02:20:53,301 --> 02:20:55,610
But that's,
that's already coming and then

2881
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:59,480
psilocybin is coming for approval as
medicine,

2882
02:20:59,481 --> 02:21:01,520
you know,
Johns Hopkins is doing amazing research

2883
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:04,070
on that for both palliative care and a
variety of other thing.

2884
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:07,040
MTMA for posttraumatic stress is coming
online.

2885
02:21:07,310 --> 02:21:11,450
Marijuana,
just by sheer sensibility and numbers is

2886
02:21:11,451 --> 02:21:15,260
going to be legal at some point.
So like all of these ponies are in the

2887
02:21:15,261 --> 02:21:18,590
race and I think they're all going to
come to fruition somewhere in the next

2888
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:19,400
five,
10 years,

2889
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:21,800
while also the information that the
Internet is providing.

2890
02:21:21,830 --> 02:21:25,100
Totally.
You can go online today and find all the

2891
02:21:25,101 --> 02:21:29,300
different things that marijuana is good
at and then find out the fact that it's

2892
02:21:29,301 --> 02:21:31,730
a schedule one drug,
the United States of America and you go,

2893
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:34,020
oh well,
whoever's making the schedules a

2894
02:21:34,021 --> 02:21:37,700
criminal and it's real simple.
You've got this plant that you can eat,

2895
02:21:37,701 --> 02:21:40,700
you could eat,
you could use it to make a fuel for a

2896
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:42,800
lamp.
He could build a fucking house out of

2897
02:21:42,801 --> 02:21:44,750
it.
Like you can make clothes with it,

2898
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:48,170
you can make paper with it.
You can essentially make everything with

2899
02:21:48,171 --> 02:21:48,410
it.

2900
02:21:48,410 --> 02:21:50,920
You need to get a hemp stock,
you need to get a piece like,

2901
02:21:50,940 --> 02:21:52,340
I'm going gonna,
I'm going to order you one.

2902
02:21:52,550 --> 02:21:55,400
We'll get some.
If it is a tree grows large,

2903
02:21:55,401 --> 02:22:00,401
it gets fat like like a forearm and it
weighs nothing and it's hard as a rock.

2904
02:22:00,921 --> 02:22:03,770
It's fucking alien.
It's so weird.

2905
02:22:03,771 --> 02:22:05,960
It's not like any other plant that
exists on earth.

2906
02:22:05,961 --> 02:22:10,160
It's so strange,
but these laws that are in place,

2907
02:22:10,161 --> 02:22:13,550
we're all in place.
Back when information was difficult to

2908
02:22:13,551 --> 02:22:17,450
come by back when you had to get it
through these selected media sources

2909
02:22:17,451 --> 02:22:21,080
like newspapers or television shows and
everybody was confused.

2910
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:24,110
Everybody was worried they were going to
go crazy like reefer madness and jump

2911
02:22:24,111 --> 02:22:26,100
off a building or stab white women

2912
02:22:26,310 --> 02:22:29,610
when nobody knew they they didn't know,
and now we do know.

2913
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:34,640
So now that we do know those,
those nonsensical non reality based

2914
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:40,470
perceptions are eroding their roading
right before our eyes.

2915
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:43,410
In the line of it is things like
podcasts.

2916
02:22:43,770 --> 02:22:46,560
A lot of his things like Ted talks,
lectures,

2917
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:49,290
people explaining the actual reality of
it,

2918
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:51,630
information,
social media,

2919
02:22:51,900 --> 02:22:56,900
stories that are being printed in online
media sources where they explain like

2920
02:22:57,720 --> 02:23:01,320
the actual effects of these drugs that
John Hopkins studies where you can,

2921
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:06,350
you can read in New York Times the
benefits of Psilocybin for people who

2922
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:11,490
are experiencing the the end of life
relieving of pressure of people that are

2923
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:16,700
terrified about dying.
People who have had some serious

2924
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:21,950
traumatic abuse in their life and their
being cured of the burden of that with

2925
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:27,051
psychedelic medicines and it's bizarre.
It's bizarre the time that we live in

2926
02:23:28,620 --> 02:23:31,650
and that all these things are sort of
sprouting out of the earth.

2927
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:36,270
They've been suppressed and stuffed into
the ground by these people that were

2928
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:40,230
essentially the enemies of information
that they were distributing false

2929
02:23:40,231 --> 02:23:42,540
information,
suppressing the real information.

2930
02:23:42,541 --> 02:23:47,400
I mean Nixon was the enemy of
information because he sponsored these

2931
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:51,390
studies to show how bad marijuana was
and when it turned out,

2932
02:23:51,391 --> 02:23:53,340
the marijuana is actually not bad at
all.

2933
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:57,840
They suppress that information.
He's actually the enemy of data.

2934
02:23:58,140 --> 02:24:01,410
He'll like push that data down into the
ground and never released it,

2935
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:06,620
but now it's just just through sheer
truth is popping through the earth and

2936
02:24:06,811 --> 02:24:11,811
you're seeing Colorado experiencing
record revenues and taxes and when that

2937
02:24:12,571 --> 02:24:17,070
happens,
then all the evil people who quote

2938
02:24:17,071 --> 02:24:21,240
unquote the people that are
concentrating solely on numbers on money

2939
02:24:21,690 --> 02:24:26,660
now they're involved because you're
talking about a state in Colorado that's

2940
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:30,720
made more money from taxes from
marijuana than they did from alcohol

2941
02:24:30,721 --> 02:24:33,150
last year,
which is fucking insane.

2942
02:24:33,570 --> 02:24:38,570
But Tulsa Pot people don't mind paying
39 percent taxes if you make it legal

2943
02:24:38,790 --> 02:24:41,040
because then what's the joint?
Seven bucks instead of five.

2944
02:24:41,130 --> 02:24:42,090
Fuck it.
Let's do it.

2945
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:42,840
Yeah.
No,

2946
02:24:42,840 --> 02:24:45,150
seven bucks.
And your blast that off your head for

2947
02:24:45,151 --> 02:24:49,480
like the next 10 hours.
Do you understand like how much drinking

2948
02:24:49,520 --> 02:24:52,260
costs?
You know if you get a drink at a bar,

2949
02:24:52,261 --> 02:24:53,910
like what is.
I don't even know what a drink cost.

2950
02:24:54,750 --> 02:24:55,583
10 Bucks.
Okay.

2951
02:24:55,950 --> 02:24:57,330
So what?
Two drinks?

2952
02:24:57,331 --> 02:25:00,510
20 bucks.
20 bucks worth of pot will fuck you up

2953
02:25:00,511 --> 02:25:04,590
for a week.
You get 20 bucks worth of marijuana.

2954
02:25:04,770 --> 02:25:08,590
Like if you,
you can smoke like three hits a day for

2955
02:25:08,670 --> 02:25:11,400
four or five days in a row on 20 bucks
worth of weed.

2956
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:12,751
Yeah,
no doubt.

2957
02:25:12,751 --> 02:25:15,060
I mean it's,
it's a chronicle,

2958
02:25:15,090 --> 02:25:18,540
it's economical and it's inescapable
now.

2959
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:19,800
Like they've let the,
the,

2960
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:22,200
that oppression can only work when it's
tight.

2961
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:24,030
When you start to like the

2962
02:25:24,320 --> 02:25:27,760
plants growing up through the concrete,
the concrete starts to break off and all

2963
02:25:27,761 --> 02:25:30,310
of a sudden it returns the jungle again.
You can't,

2964
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:33,640
you can't keep this stuff down.
And I was actually,

2965
02:25:33,641 --> 02:25:36,070
I had dinner with the maps people at my
house,

2966
02:25:36,071 --> 02:25:38,620
a little charity dinner and they
presented some of the new data that was

2967
02:25:38,621 --> 02:25:41,080
coming out from their recent study on
Mtma.

2968
02:25:41,740 --> 02:25:46,720
Unbelievable results for treating PTSD.
So to give it like a quick summary,

2969
02:25:46,990 --> 02:25:50,770
posttraumatic stress has a scale and the
scale goes from zero to 1:30.

2970
02:25:50,771 --> 02:25:55,060
One 30 is like the most incomprehensible
amount of terrible shit that's happened

2971
02:25:55,061 --> 02:25:57,760
to you possible lived in a cage your
whole life,

2972
02:25:57,761 --> 02:25:58,900
whatever.
Tortured forever.

2973
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:03,130
Most people have a certain amount,
like five of skift score of five or 10.

2974
02:26:03,131 --> 02:26:04,930
There's always been bad shit that's
happened to people,

2975
02:26:04,931 --> 02:26:07,540
but like the threshold is somewhere
around 50.

2976
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:10,090
Oh,
anything over 50 year actually

2977
02:26:10,120 --> 02:26:14,320
diagnosable with ptsd and in the kind of
medical record as far as I understand

2978
02:26:14,321 --> 02:26:16,660
it.
And so in their recent studies,

2979
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:18,310
you know,
they're getting an average of people

2980
02:26:18,311 --> 02:26:22,720
with treatment resistant ptsd.
That means the drugs didn't work and

2981
02:26:22,721 --> 02:26:24,670
what the drugs showed and it's a
combination of,

2982
02:26:24,671 --> 02:26:28,690
I believe Paxil and Zoloft with the drug
showed is they were able with consistent

2983
02:26:28,691 --> 02:26:32,320
application to reduce that score like
six to 10 points,

2984
02:26:32,350 --> 02:26:35,620
so from like 70 to 60,
so still pretty fucked up.

2985
02:26:35,621 --> 02:26:37,780
You're not down like in the normal
range,

2986
02:26:37,781 --> 02:26:41,260
which is somewhere around 10,
reduced it from 70 to 60.

2987
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:44,830
With the MTMA assisted psychotherapy,
there's three sessions,

2988
02:26:45,040 --> 02:26:47,360
you know,
where they took Mtma three times with a

2989
02:26:47,361 --> 02:26:52,361
therapist and it reduced it like 50
points and not only did it reduce it 50

2990
02:26:52,991 --> 02:26:57,991
points instead of 10,
it continued to drop over the next three

2991
02:26:58,001 --> 02:27:01,460
years that they observe them without any
utilization of mdms.

2992
02:27:01,870 --> 02:27:04,810
So it's like instead of this,
this constant treatment,

2993
02:27:05,230 --> 02:27:09,910
there's a cure potentially out there.
That's available where three times you

2994
02:27:09,911 --> 02:27:14,050
do this thing and of course you know the
psychotherapy isn't to be ignored.

2995
02:27:14,051 --> 02:27:16,990
That's an important part of this.
It's Mtma assisted psychotherapy,

2996
02:27:16,991 --> 02:27:20,290
not just willy nilly taking the drugs
and hold someone that guide you and

2997
02:27:20,590 --> 02:27:24,520
guiding you through into these
situations and it's amazingly powerful

2998
02:27:24,521 --> 02:27:27,610
and this is a disease that affects or
disorder rather,

2999
02:27:27,611 --> 02:27:31,150
that affects so many millions of people
who are suffering and you just have

3000
02:27:31,151 --> 02:27:35,650
something there on the fringe with this
data coming out and pretty soon it

3001
02:27:35,651 --> 02:27:40,300
becomes incredibly unethical to keep
this illegal when the data is showing

3002
02:27:40,301 --> 02:27:43,300
that much promise.
Like any other pharmaceutical drug that

3003
02:27:43,301 --> 02:27:45,640
could be patentable,
that showed that much promise and doing

3004
02:27:45,641 --> 02:27:50,040
something fast tracked.
I mean it would be like like that a act

3005
02:27:50,050 --> 02:27:52,840
drug which ended up not working,
but when everybody's afraid of aids and

3006
02:27:52,880 --> 02:27:55,480
like this may work,
all of a sudden that shit was legal in

3007
02:27:55,481 --> 02:27:58,240
like six months because people were
freaked out.

3008
02:27:58,510 --> 02:28:01,960
I mean that's what should happen with
Mgma and we'll see if it does.

3009
02:28:01,961 --> 02:28:03,610
You know,
because when this data is presented,

3010
02:28:03,611 --> 02:28:07,690
it's going to be such a convincing case.
It really becomes unethical not to use

3011
02:28:07,691 --> 02:28:07,860
it.

3012
02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:11,730
Well,
I think we're also in a world now where

3013
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:16,940
children are growing up and they're
growing up from the time they're a baby.

3014
02:28:17,101 --> 02:28:20,760
They have access to the Internet and the
culture that exists today is so

3015
02:28:20,761 --> 02:28:25,761
radically than the culture pre 1994 that
the children that are born in 1994 have

3016
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:30,320
now they have.
They're 20 years old,

3017
02:28:30,640 --> 02:28:35,640
you know now they're adults and they've
grown up with the Internet from the time

3018
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:39,140
they were babies.
Those are the people that are just not

3019
02:28:39,141 --> 02:28:43,760
going to accept the laws that are in
place as they get older and they become

3020
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:48,200
leaders and politicians and they're
going to have a completely different

3021
02:28:48,201 --> 02:28:53,201
idea than some of these old wacky fucks
that are just they.

3022
02:28:53,441 --> 02:28:56,300
They're operating on a false paradigm
they're operating with,

3023
02:28:56,330 --> 02:28:59,780
with bad information and they're the
what,

3024
02:28:59,810 --> 02:29:01,370
what,
what's undeniable.

3025
02:29:01,371 --> 02:29:04,040
It's concrete and solid to them just
isn't,

3026
02:29:04,270 --> 02:29:06,290
well,
bull drugs are bad and it's bad for your

3027
02:29:06,291 --> 02:29:06,710
brain.

3028
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:08,510
Like,
I had a conversation with Michio Kaku

3029
02:29:08,511 --> 02:29:11,450
once when I was on the opiod,
Anthony Show when I was asking him

3030
02:29:11,480 --> 02:29:12,200
about,
uh,

3031
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:15,680
about psychedelic drugs.
I forgot what I was asking them about,

3032
02:29:16,070 --> 02:29:16,521
but,
uh,

3033
02:29:16,521 --> 02:29:17,340
it was like,
well,

3034
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:20,450
we know scientists,
we're trying to expand our brain.

3035
02:29:20,451 --> 02:29:22,490
We don't want to give ourselves brain
damage.

3036
02:29:22,670 --> 02:29:27,670
I gave this idea that you would ruin
your brain by doing mushrooms.

3037
02:29:28,131 --> 02:29:28,300
Like,
Oh,

3038
02:29:28,300 --> 02:29:29,540
well,
you've never done mushrooms,

3039
02:29:29,541 --> 02:29:30,740
right?
Have you ever done mushrooms?

3040
02:29:30,741 --> 02:29:32,810
No,
I wouldn't do it because I don't want to

3041
02:29:32,811 --> 02:29:34,430
ruin my brain.
I want to expand my.

3042
02:29:34,610 --> 02:29:35,210
And I was like,
well,

3043
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:36,770
you don't understand what you're saying
that you're,

3044
02:29:36,780 --> 02:29:38,630
you're talking about something that you
don't,

3045
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:41,870
you've never experienced.
So you have this idea in your head that

3046
02:29:41,871 --> 02:29:45,470
it's bad for you based on what?
Based on propaganda.

3047
02:29:45,471 --> 02:29:46,460
But then I realized,
well,

3048
02:29:46,461 --> 02:29:49,370
he's in academia,
being an academia,

3049
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:50,101
purdue,
you know,

3050
02:29:50,101 --> 02:29:51,230
uh,
doing lectures,

3051
02:29:51,231 --> 02:29:54,470
do you use it,
would radically limit his income,

3052
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:57,920
radically limit his exposure if he came
out and started saying,

3053
02:29:58,190 --> 02:29:58,851
you know,
hey,

3054
02:29:58,851 --> 02:30:00,980
I'm,
I'm really in favor of people trying

3055
02:30:00,981 --> 02:30:04,490
drugs and going to the jungle and
fucking hanging out with barefoot dudes

3056
02:30:04,730 --> 02:30:09,730
or giving you some toxic frog poison
makes away from that one.

3057
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:14,600
I've done a lot of things and that was
definitely not one that you want to do

3058
02:30:14,790 --> 02:30:16,360
the Kambo poison.
But yeah,

3059
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:21,140
I mean the psilocybin has been shown to
have neurogenesis help rebuild the brain

3060
02:30:21,141 --> 02:30:24,080
and neurons like what?
Yeah,

3061
02:30:24,081 --> 02:30:25,970
that's some crazy shit.
And you know,

3062
02:30:26,030 --> 02:30:29,510
if you've experienced DMT,
either an Iowaska or smokable form,

3063
02:30:29,810 --> 02:30:32,000
you know,
a lot of times it feels like there's a

3064
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:35,360
thousand little doctors like soldering
and fixing shit in your brain.

3065
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:37,070
You're like,
oh well the end.

3066
02:30:37,170 --> 02:30:39,740
It was nice.
The end of my trips always feel like,

3067
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:41,780
like almost like,
you know,

3068
02:30:41,790 --> 02:30:44,700
if like if you went theoretically
because we've never done this,

3069
02:30:44,840 --> 02:30:47,180
could go to a massage parlor and get a
hand release.

3070
02:30:47,410 --> 02:30:49,520
Like they actually rubbed you down first
and they go,

3071
02:30:49,521 --> 02:30:50,810
all right,
now let's take care of the problem.

3072
02:30:51,960 --> 02:30:55,190
Um,
will dmt feels like you have this wild

3073
02:30:55,191 --> 02:30:58,640
exploratory trip.
And then the end of it to me always

3074
02:30:58,641 --> 02:31:00,410
feels like they're like,
all right,

3075
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:03,170
well we got to do some maintenance.
So just kick back and look at the pretty

3076
02:31:03,171 --> 02:31:05,420
lights were done showing you shit.
We're just going to,

3077
02:31:05,630 --> 02:31:08,690
we're going to go deep there and just
try to correct some shit.

3078
02:31:09,070 --> 02:31:10,340
Yeah.
You hear the,

3079
02:31:10,341 --> 02:31:12,350
you hear in the Eco rose the IOWASCA
songs.

3080
02:31:12,351 --> 02:31:14,650
We'll often talk to Dr Ceto,
you know,

3081
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:18,200
Dr Ceto his little doctor.
And so it's like,

3082
02:31:18,410 --> 02:31:19,980
it's a paradigm exists in

3083
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:22,320
many cultures and you can feel it
independently,

3084
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:24,210
you know,
like I was feeling that before I

3085
02:31:24,211 --> 02:31:25,021
realized like,
Oh,

3086
02:31:25,021 --> 02:31:26,900
Dr c dot a little doctor,
you know,

3087
02:31:26,901 --> 02:31:28,650
that's what they're,
that's what they're talking about.

3088
02:31:28,651 --> 02:31:30,350
His little doctor come here,
you,

3089
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:32,940
you know,
and that's what they're singing to the

3090
02:31:32,941 --> 02:31:33,810
plants.
These,

3091
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:36,330
these medicines will.
There's so many people that are dealing

3092
02:31:36,331 --> 02:31:38,910
with traumatic brain injuries these
days.

3093
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:43,380
How fascinating would it be if it found
out if they found out or it could prove

3094
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:47,820
that siliciden could alleviate the
problems with traumatic brain injury by

3095
02:31:47,821 --> 02:31:50,940
regenerating tissue,
but actually healing the brain?

3096
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:53,730
I mean,
maybe it's not where that is right now.

3097
02:31:53,731 --> 02:31:55,350
I mean maybe it hasn't gotten to a
stage,

3098
02:31:55,351 --> 02:31:59,350
but between that stem cell treatments
and all sorts of different ways.

3099
02:31:59,351 --> 02:32:04,351
There's so many people like when you
lose the ability to see reality

3100
02:32:04,441 --> 02:32:06,240
correctly because your brain's not
functioning like either.

3101
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:08,970
You're very Oregon.
It's like having a television that just

3102
02:32:08,971 --> 02:32:10,950
doesn't get a good signal anymore.
It's all fucked up.

3103
02:32:11,190 --> 02:32:12,330
Well,
it's got to be fixed,

3104
02:32:12,420 --> 02:32:13,770
right,
but we can't fix it.

3105
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,770
Like right now,
the brain has a very limited ability to

3106
02:32:16,771 --> 02:32:20,640
fix itself and there are some strategies
and some different treatments that they

3107
02:32:20,641 --> 02:32:25,641
use to help people recover from
traumatic brain injuries and get to some

3108
02:32:25,681 --> 02:32:28,470
semblance of normalcy.
But imagine if they got to a point where

3109
02:32:28,471 --> 02:32:33,471
they found out that this neurogenesis
capability that we've shown to exist in

3110
02:32:33,670 --> 02:32:38,310
silicide and can actually rebuild tissue
and heal brain and run proper studies

3111
02:32:38,311 --> 02:32:40,620
like you would with any other
supplementary thing out.

3112
02:32:40,621 --> 02:32:41,191
They're like,
all right,

3113
02:32:41,191 --> 02:32:44,760
well let's try a micro dose for over the
course of two months.

3114
02:32:44,790 --> 02:32:47,430
You know,
like a sub detectable where you're not

3115
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:50,760
like tripping your balls,
but just something like you would a

3116
02:32:50,761 --> 02:32:51,690
nutritional supplement.

3117
02:32:51,690 --> 02:32:55,650
Let's test that over against placebo for
two months and then measure the results

3118
02:32:55,651 --> 02:32:56,484
in the brain.
Well,

3119
02:32:56,790 --> 02:33:01,680
the suppression has just eliminated that
option for science to just explore these

3120
02:33:01,681 --> 02:33:05,340
hypotheses.
Like what happens if you microdose dmt

3121
02:33:05,610 --> 02:33:07,800
in some form over the course of two
months?

3122
02:33:07,801 --> 02:33:11,880
Like how does that affect performance?
And a lot of people are doing that now.

3123
02:33:11,881 --> 02:33:14,880
They're microdosing on their own and
anecdotally reporting something.

3124
02:33:14,881 --> 02:33:19,800
But what we need is a placebo controlled
trial to say like unequivocably,

3125
02:33:19,950 --> 02:33:21,300
Oh yeah,
that's what this does.

3126
02:33:21,330 --> 02:33:25,140
But it's so hard to get that shit
approved and get the approval material

3127
02:33:25,141 --> 02:33:28,530
and get this done that it's.
It's become challenging.

3128
02:33:28,531 --> 02:33:31,590
But when that lids off,
it's going to be really,

3129
02:33:31,591 --> 02:33:34,830
really fucking cool.
I agree that this is the coolest time to

3130
02:33:34,831 --> 02:33:37,830
be alive.
It really is an an amazing,

3131
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:40,350
fascinating time to be alive.
But I wonder if they're going to look

3132
02:33:40,351 --> 02:33:43,530
back at us the way we look at champs.
You know,

3133
02:33:43,650 --> 02:33:45,870
lily's fucking dummies.
They thought that was an awesome time to

3134
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:46,733
be alive.

3135
02:33:48,710 --> 02:33:53,250
I wonder.
I wonder if people always have that way

3136
02:33:53,251 --> 02:33:57,750
of looking at things where they just
appreciate what's around them and say,

3137
02:33:57,751 --> 02:33:59,460
wow,
this is as good as it's ever been.

3138
02:33:59,461 --> 02:34:02,940
This is amazing.
But then one day they'll look back at us

3139
02:34:02,941 --> 02:34:05,430
and go with how ridiculous they couldn't
even read minds.

3140
02:34:05,550 --> 02:34:08,880
Imagine going through life not being
able to read minds like what a shitty

3141
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:11,220
way to live.
Sort of how we look at people that can't

3142
02:34:11,221 --> 02:34:13,590
send emails.
They didn't even have the Internet.

3143
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:17,590
You had to go to a library and read a
book that was written hand.

3144
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:18,010
Like

3145
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:20,800
some guy wrote the a pen.
He had a feather,

3146
02:34:20,950 --> 02:34:25,100
a dip it in some coal that they mixed
with oil or whatever the fuck they use

3147
02:34:25,101 --> 02:34:26,680
to make ink.
Yeah.

3148
02:34:26,770 --> 02:34:31,180
We're going to probably look back at
that someday and maybe even in our

3149
02:34:31,181 --> 02:34:33,700
lifetimes.
But I bet there's also those people who

3150
02:34:33,701 --> 02:34:36,070
if you took them from the past like
let's say,

3151
02:34:36,310 --> 02:34:38,230
you know,
you talked to him Musashi and you're

3152
02:34:38,231 --> 02:34:40,510
like,
there's an awesome future,

3153
02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:43,360
but you can't use your sword to cut
anybody.

3154
02:34:43,361 --> 02:34:44,890
He'd be like,
fuck,

3155
02:34:45,130 --> 02:34:46,690
I think I'm good.
You know,

3156
02:34:46,691 --> 02:34:49,420
it's like we got all this cool shit.
We got computers and knowledge and you

3157
02:34:49,421 --> 02:34:50,470
know,
all these different things.

3158
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:52,270
Travel the world.
We have drones.

3159
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:56,410
You don't even have to be involved and
just have to be like in another room

3160
02:34:56,411 --> 02:34:58,330
somewhere else.
He's not going to be into that.

3161
02:34:58,360 --> 02:35:03,100
So much is just holding the steel in his
hand and just that's got to meet and so

3162
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:08,101
in every age there's these parts of that
age that are irreplaceable.

3163
02:35:08,410 --> 02:35:11,410
I was in Vegas yesterday leaving the
airport early in the morning and you

3164
02:35:11,411 --> 02:35:12,640
know,
you're waiting in line at the security

3165
02:35:12,641 --> 02:35:16,450
thing to show your id and I looked up
and they had a screen that was giving

3166
02:35:16,451 --> 02:35:21,220
instructions and guidelines for using
drones and I was like,

3167
02:35:21,250 --> 02:35:24,100
Jesus Christ,
we're living in the future.

3168
02:35:24,430 --> 02:35:25,111
Like it,
it,

3169
02:35:25,111 --> 02:35:27,160
it almost.
I was waiting for it to be a joke

3170
02:35:27,161 --> 02:35:29,170
because if you ever gone through the Las
Vegas airport,

3171
02:35:29,290 --> 02:35:34,290
they have these big screens up and
they'll show these sort of humorous

3172
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:36,610
character sketches.
Yeah.

3173
02:35:36,620 --> 02:35:39,460
Carrot top.
Trying to carry all his props through

3174
02:35:39,461 --> 02:35:41,680
the security and showing what you can't
do.

3175
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:45,400
They have these heavy metal guys that
are taking off these giant spiked risk

3176
02:35:45,401 --> 02:35:50,080
bracelets and you know what you have to
like take off to go through security and

3177
02:35:50,081 --> 02:35:52,690
so on.
The same screen where they show that

3178
02:35:53,020 --> 02:35:56,500
they showed this thing about drones and
I was like,

3179
02:35:56,680 --> 02:35:58,810
this seems like some starship troopers.

3180
02:35:58,810 --> 02:36:01,630
Shit.
It seems like it doesn't seem real,

3181
02:36:01,840 --> 02:36:05,470
but it was real.
They were talking about the Federal

3182
02:36:05,470 --> 02:36:08,170
Aviation Administration and the
guidelines and rules for using drones.

3183
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:12,250
Don't let your drone get out of sight.
Don't make your drone go over a certain

3184
02:36:12,251 --> 02:36:15,820
amount of feet in the air.
Don't let your drone wandered near

3185
02:36:15,821 --> 02:36:18,820
airports.
Don't let your drone get involved in the

3186
02:36:18,821 --> 02:36:21,400
path of commercial flights.
I was like,

3187
02:36:21,401 --> 02:36:22,630
wow,
this is.

3188
02:36:22,750 --> 02:36:25,240
Please use your drone responsibly.
And I'm like,

3189
02:36:25,241 --> 02:36:27,260
whoa.
This is bizarre.

3190
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,810
Yeah,
like demolition man.

3191
02:36:28,811 --> 02:36:33,190
Weird future shit girl.
You see the drone that I almost dropped

3192
02:36:33,191 --> 02:36:34,930
on that skier?
No.

3193
02:36:35,020 --> 02:36:38,760
Jamie tried to find that there was a
drone that drops out of the sky and

3194
02:36:38,770 --> 02:36:42,400
almost completely obliterate ran out of
gas or something.

3195
02:36:42,430 --> 02:36:44,680
Ran Out of fucking signal or something
like.

3196
02:36:44,681 --> 02:36:47,890
And Paul's like right on the heels of
his skis.

3197
02:36:47,980 --> 02:36:51,280
It's wasn't the guy who was piloting it?
No,

3198
02:36:51,300 --> 02:36:52,330
he was.
He was like,

3199
02:36:52,331 --> 02:36:56,560
it was an actual competition.
So he's skiing ski racer.

3200
02:36:56,920 --> 02:36:58,360
Watch this.
Oh my God.

3201
02:36:58,510 --> 02:37:02,260
Oh Jesus Christ.
Hold on back that up again.

3202
02:37:02,740 --> 02:37:04,080
Oh my God.
Slowmo.

3203
02:37:06,520 --> 02:37:08,890
Tom.
That's insane.

3204
02:37:09,100 --> 02:37:11,890
That want to fuck that dude.
I'm fucked him up for sure.

3205
02:37:11,950 --> 02:37:15,860
Wow.
I wonder if that was like a person in

3206
02:37:15,861 --> 02:37:20,120
the audience that wanted to get like a
good video of it or whether that was the

3207
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:22,040
real camera crew.
It's weird.

3208
02:37:22,610 --> 02:37:24,440
Well,
there's a thing going on right now where

3209
02:37:24,441 --> 02:37:29,030
there's new technology that they haven't
had the ability to form the proper

3210
02:37:29,031 --> 02:37:32,540
regulations for yet and they're not
really aware of like what the issues are

3211
02:37:32,810 --> 02:37:37,100
like those Goddamn hoverboards,
those things like you see people at the

3212
02:37:37,101 --> 02:37:38,640
airport,
at least they were for awhile.

3213
02:37:38,690 --> 02:37:41,410
I think they're trying to make that
illegal where they're at the airport and

3214
02:37:41,411 --> 02:37:46,280
they're wandering through the terminals
on these hoverboards just scooting along

3215
02:37:46,281 --> 02:37:47,410
on these.
These,

3216
02:37:47,810 --> 02:37:52,160
if you don't know what a hoverboard is,
it's essentially like a surf or it's

3217
02:37:52,161 --> 02:37:55,490
like a skateboard,
but instead of going sideways,

3218
02:37:55,520 --> 02:37:57,650
like the way you skate,
you go forward.

3219
02:37:57,950 --> 02:37:58,670
Like,
uh,

3220
02:37:58,670 --> 02:38:03,110
it's so it's perpendicular and there's
wheels on it and the wheels are like

3221
02:38:03,470 --> 02:38:04,303
those,
uh,

3222
02:38:04,610 --> 02:38:05,870
those.
What are those things called?

3223
02:38:05,871 --> 02:38:06,900
The fucking.
The,

3224
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:08,630
the segway.
The segway.

3225
02:38:08,631 --> 02:38:12,380
Thank you.
It's a gyroscope and the gyroscopes sort

3226
02:38:12,381 --> 02:38:14,390
of balances you out and you roll around.
They're fun.

3227
02:38:14,391 --> 02:38:16,490
My kids have them.
I ride them around the house,

3228
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:19,310
they're really fun,
but now they're starting to have

3229
02:38:19,311 --> 02:38:20,780
regulations like they're starting to
say,

3230
02:38:20,781 --> 02:38:22,580
hey,
you can't ride these things on the

3231
02:38:22,581 --> 02:38:23,420
sidewalks.
You can't.

3232
02:38:23,421 --> 02:38:25,130
Okay,
now we're making rules because those

3233
02:38:25,131 --> 02:38:27,090
rules didn't exist before.
And people like,

3234
02:38:27,170 --> 02:38:31,040
remember when the Wiz Khalifa got
arrested at the airport,

3235
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:33,050
he got arrested the airport because he
wouldn't get off of it.

3236
02:38:33,140 --> 02:38:37,030
Really Monitor to around probably
highest fuck tattoos on his face and he

3237
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:39,260
doesn't give a fuck about a hoverboard
and you know,

3238
02:38:39,310 --> 02:38:42,800
they arrested him for it.
That doesn't help street credit actually

3239
02:38:42,950 --> 02:38:46,610
when you get arrested for robbery,
I mean there's a lot of arrests that

3240
02:38:46,611 --> 02:38:48,260
might help a rapper,
but that's maybe not.

3241
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:50,640
Anytime a wrapper gets arrested,
it's good because the thing is they

3242
02:38:50,690 --> 02:38:52,960
complain.
These niggas don't know.

3243
02:38:54,590 --> 02:38:57,350
I don't know if you should be allowed to
do it,

3244
02:38:57,351 --> 02:39:00,170
but I do know when you do do it,
if you know what you're doing,

3245
02:39:00,171 --> 02:39:02,130
like very precise with it.
I mean,

3246
02:39:02,360 --> 02:39:05,690
it's not an issue,
but I think people have the idea,

3247
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:08,510
the,
the issue is it's automated and you can

3248
02:39:08,511 --> 02:39:10,850
potentially like,
like uh,

3249
02:39:10,880 --> 02:39:13,370
my daughter I had a slower down and like
settle down,

3250
02:39:13,371 --> 02:39:15,650
settle.
She's fucking whizzing around in this

3251
02:39:15,651 --> 02:39:18,980
thing like really fast and she's wiped
out a couple of times.

3252
02:39:18,990 --> 02:39:23,430
Like she kinda crazy and she's wiped out
and hurt herself and I'm like just going

3253
02:39:23,431 --> 02:39:27,890
to just a little too fast and shark,
she's getting to the edge of the ability

3254
02:39:27,891 --> 02:39:30,500
to control the thing.
And if someone was doing that in an

3255
02:39:30,501 --> 02:39:32,960
airport,
it could be a real problem between those

3256
02:39:32,961 --> 02:39:33,890
and drones.

3257
02:39:34,280 --> 02:39:38,270
Like these emerging technologies that we
don't necessarily have regulations for

3258
02:39:38,271 --> 02:39:40,610
yet.
And I think there's so many people that

3259
02:39:40,611 --> 02:39:43,320
are so fragile and they get so scared,
you know,

3260
02:39:43,380 --> 02:39:46,780
like they can't,
they haven't kept up with their body so

3261
02:39:46,790 --> 02:39:51,260
they can't get out of the way if some
shit happened or like if they did get

3262
02:39:51,380 --> 02:39:53,690
hit,
they're going to break for sure.

3263
02:39:53,691 --> 02:39:55,280
Like in Santa Monica,
that happens all the time.

3264
02:39:55,281 --> 02:39:58,390
We'll be riding our bikes around and
we'll pass them old people and they'll

3265
02:39:58,400 --> 02:40:00,620
just curse us.
We're not even close.

3266
02:40:00,770 --> 02:40:01,640
Yeah.
Like on the bikes,

3267
02:40:01,641 --> 02:40:03,450
we miss them by six feet.
Yeah.

3268
02:40:03,510 --> 02:40:07,790
Like fuck.
Because they know they're just in this

3269
02:40:07,791 --> 02:40:11,870
kind of like fragile state and so they
kind of panic when there's something on

3270
02:40:11,871 --> 02:40:14,010
wheels rolling by.
They don't really

3271
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:17,920
understand them.
Crackers there are made out of crackers.

3272
02:40:19,190 --> 02:40:20,940
They fall down.
It's a wrap.

3273
02:40:20,970 --> 02:40:22,170
It's over.
Everything over.

3274
02:40:22,610 --> 02:40:25,920
Imagine a wiping out on an old lady with
a bike.

3275
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:29,910
If you're whipping along on a mountain
bike and you collided with an 80 year

3276
02:40:29,911 --> 02:40:32,730
old lady,
he would just shatter her whole body.

3277
02:40:32,731 --> 02:40:34,710
Everything would just snap.
Crackle.

3278
02:40:35,310 --> 02:40:37,620
They can't fall down like you can't fall
down.

3279
02:40:37,650 --> 02:40:40,530
Imagine you're.
Your body gets to a place where you

3280
02:40:40,531 --> 02:40:43,590
cannot fall down if you fall down.
Everything breaks.

3281
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:47,070
Yeah.
That's not a future that I'm hoping for.

3282
02:40:47,130 --> 02:40:49,230
Yeah.
I mean fuck.

3283
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:52,260
I wonder how much that can be mitigated
by strength training.

3284
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:54,930
A lot.
Training and mineralization,

3285
02:40:54,931 --> 02:40:56,840
you know,
keeping their bone density up,

3286
02:40:56,850 --> 02:40:59,870
making sure that you have the spare
parts to replace the ones that you're

3287
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:00,631
losing,
you know,

3288
02:41:00,631 --> 02:41:02,250
I think that's,
you know,

3289
02:41:02,251 --> 02:41:03,120
a big part of it.

3290
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:06,690
Getting the muscles on the frame and
then supporting the bones and making

3291
02:41:06,691 --> 02:41:10,170
sure that your body is sturdy enough
because you see the other way if you see

3292
02:41:10,171 --> 02:41:14,040
these people is just sturdy is shit and
all different cultures.

3293
02:41:14,041 --> 02:41:16,170
Cultures that don't have medicines and
pharmaceuticals.

3294
02:41:16,171 --> 02:41:20,550
Like even in the jungle again,
you'll see somebody 75 with a machete,

3295
02:41:20,551 --> 02:41:24,210
just kicking ass macho,
big cigarette coming out of his mouth.

3296
02:41:24,211 --> 02:41:27,510
Just ha ha.
And then drinks beers at the end of the

3297
02:41:27,510 --> 02:41:27,781
day.
You know,

3298
02:41:27,781 --> 02:41:30,660
like if you stay that vigorous and
active,

3299
02:41:30,661 --> 02:41:31,900
you can,
you know,

3300
02:41:32,070 --> 02:41:35,700
and eating very natural foods.
Obviously they don't have another choice

3301
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,990
and a lot of those cases you can see the
other side and then you can see this

3302
02:41:39,991 --> 02:41:44,370
kind of this other amalgamation which is
gary where you got cracker bones.

3303
02:41:44,400 --> 02:41:45,270
Yeah,
that's more,

3304
02:41:45,330 --> 02:41:48,390
that's another benefit of being able to
do the work.

3305
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:52,500
Being able to force yourself to do some
things you don't want to do as far as

3306
02:41:52,501 --> 02:41:55,470
that like exercise and pushing yourself.

3307
02:41:55,980 --> 02:42:00,390
The benefits of that are you have a body
that works way better for way longer,

3308
02:42:00,570 --> 02:42:03,210
and if you don't do that,
you get deterioration and you get

3309
02:42:03,211 --> 02:42:06,260
atrophy and then you become frail.
You become that old person.

3310
02:42:06,261 --> 02:42:08,610
It's screaming at you because you're on
a bike 10 feet away from them.

3311
02:42:09,700 --> 02:42:12,170
You can kill me.
Cracker bones.

3312
02:42:13,310 --> 02:42:14,380
Yeah,
exactly.

3313
02:42:14,490 --> 02:42:15,360
It's a bummer,
man.

3314
02:42:15,870 --> 02:42:17,010
It's a bummer.
That's a.

3315
02:42:17,011 --> 02:42:19,080
that's another inevitable bummer about
life,

3316
02:42:19,081 --> 02:42:22,980
but it's also isn't that part of what's
beautiful about this is that you can't

3317
02:42:22,981 --> 02:42:25,110
be that girl with the picks and the
instagram forever,

3318
02:42:25,111 --> 02:42:29,850
like why the butt pics are so exciting
is because that but only exists for

3319
02:42:29,851 --> 02:42:34,851
about 20 years or so.
We'll start falling blossoms perfectly

3320
02:42:35,161 --> 02:42:37,140
right before it falls off into nothing.
You know?

3321
02:42:37,141 --> 02:42:39,420
That was the great symbol for the
Samurai was.

3322
02:42:39,421 --> 02:42:42,780
That's why they appreciated it because
it flowers and beauty and then falls.

3323
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:47,070
That's life time.
Time will rip US clutching and grabbing

3324
02:42:47,071 --> 02:42:50,190
from every attachment that we have.
It always wins.

3325
02:42:50,460 --> 02:42:54,450
It's like someone in Jujitsu with the
ultimate squeeze that never gets tired

3326
02:42:54,451 --> 02:42:58,050
like we're going to have to tap out at
some point of everything that we love.

3327
02:42:58,051 --> 02:43:00,740
Everything that we like,
so might as well just accept that like

3328
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:02,820
it's cool.
Enjoy it while it's here and in a

3329
02:43:02,821 --> 02:43:04,980
fractal sense.
Even if you can live forever,

3330
02:43:04,981 --> 02:43:06,910
the fucking planet will be here forever,
right?

3331
02:43:07,410 --> 02:43:11,100
The Sun will burn out,
the sun is going to run out of energy

3332
02:43:11,110 --> 02:43:15,370
and it's going to eventually supernova.
Good luck.

3333
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:18,790
You can't live forever.
There is no forever.

3334
02:43:18,791 --> 02:43:21,040
It doesn't exist.
Time always wins.

3335
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:24,840
That time is a motherfucker know.
It is such a motherfucker.

3336
02:43:24,850 --> 02:43:29,750
I wrote this piece for Maxim magazine
about how the human body's like sand

3337
02:43:29,751 --> 02:43:32,320
castle.
That's one of the cool things about a

3338
02:43:32,321 --> 02:43:35,560
sand castle as you're building it and
one of the beautiful things about,

3339
02:43:35,561 --> 02:43:36,940
as you know,
it's not gonna last.

3340
02:43:37,330 --> 02:43:39,970
If you made a sand castle out of cement,
nobody would be impressed.

3341
02:43:40,240 --> 02:43:43,030
So something about a sandcastle where
you,

3342
02:43:43,031 --> 02:43:46,930
you've put all this work into it with
the understanding that this is entirely

3343
02:43:46,931 --> 02:43:50,560
temporary and that's sort of the same
thing with a human body and I was

3344
02:43:50,561 --> 02:43:54,580
comparing old Arnold Schwartzenegger
from the seventies to the Arnold

3345
02:43:54,580 --> 02:43:57,090
Schwartzenegger now with the dad bod
when you see them now and his little

3346
02:43:57,100 --> 02:43:59,200
skivvies on the beach.
Like Whoa,

3347
02:43:59,800 --> 02:44:02,710
what the fuck man,
that's the tide is started to come in,

3348
02:44:02,830 --> 02:44:05,500
you know,
and that ocean spray is washing away the

3349
02:44:05,501 --> 02:44:09,580
towers and washing away everything until
eventually there's only the memory and

3350
02:44:09,581 --> 02:44:11,500
the pictures of that sand castle as it
was.

3351
02:44:11,650 --> 02:44:14,890
And that is fucking beautiful.
Like it's not something to be lamented,

3352
02:44:14,900 --> 02:44:17,800
like appreciate that shit.
Like it's temporary.

3353
02:44:17,801 --> 02:44:19,420
So we fucking love it.
Yup.

3354
02:44:19,480 --> 02:44:21,940
You know like that's,
that's a part of the thing.

3355
02:44:22,210 --> 02:44:24,130
Yeah.
It's one of the more fascinating aspects

3356
02:44:24,131 --> 02:44:27,490
about at all is that it is temporary and
I think that if it wasn't,

3357
02:44:27,491 --> 02:44:29,530
if everything,
it's like the way I described it in the

3358
02:44:29,531 --> 02:44:32,030
article was like if you,
if it.

3359
02:44:32,080 --> 02:44:34,840
That wasn't the case.
It would be like as boring as playing a

3360
02:44:34,841 --> 02:44:38,770
video game on God mode.
Never play a quake on God mode.

3361
02:44:39,580 --> 02:44:41,530
You can type quake used to be,
you could,

3362
02:44:41,531 --> 02:44:43,840
uh,
go to hit the [inaudible] key and go

3363
02:44:43,841 --> 02:44:46,360
into the command prompt and you can,
uh,

3364
02:44:46,570 --> 02:44:50,380
you could type in God and you would play
on God mode.

3365
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:53,530
In God mode is you were in vulnerable.
Your life would last forever.

3366
02:44:53,680 --> 02:44:56,230
It all the weapons you wanted and you
couldn't get hurt.

3367
02:44:56,320 --> 02:45:00,700
She just run around shooting things and
as boring as fuck and no consequences

3368
02:45:00,820 --> 02:45:04,840
and not worrying at all about your own
mortality.

3369
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:06,790
That would,
it wouldn't be fun.

3370
02:45:06,791 --> 02:45:09,780
Like one of the fun things about doing
wild shit is you know you're going to

3371
02:45:09,781 --> 02:45:11,350
have to sleep.
You know,

3372
02:45:11,500 --> 02:45:13,930
one of the fun things about sex is you
know what's going to end.

3373
02:45:14,020 --> 02:45:15,850
You know,
it's hard to get when you get it.

3374
02:45:15,851 --> 02:45:18,670
You know,
I can't leave her fucking and then it's

3375
02:45:18,671 --> 02:45:19,600
over.
Then your tie.

3376
02:45:19,630 --> 02:45:21,550
One of the fun things about dragon is a
god damn,

3377
02:45:21,551 --> 02:45:23,990
we're going to pay for this.
It's,

3378
02:45:24,150 --> 02:45:27,280
it's part of the whole thing is it is
the Yin and Yang.

3379
02:45:27,281 --> 02:45:28,570
It is the struggle.
It is,

3380
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:30,490
it's the,
the,

3381
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:34,660
the consequences and it's the reward and
it's all together.

3382
02:45:34,830 --> 02:45:37,480
Yeah.
It's the coolest fucking video game that

3383
02:45:37,481 --> 02:45:38,710
we all made together,
man.

3384
02:45:38,711 --> 02:45:40,420
I'm telling you,
that's really what it is.

3385
02:45:40,450 --> 02:45:42,400
And we were born into it,
born into it,

3386
02:45:42,490 --> 02:45:44,530
and then we just get to decide how we
want to play,

3387
02:45:44,590 --> 02:45:46,240
you know,
decide if we want to level up,

3388
02:45:46,241 --> 02:45:49,180
decide if we want to retreat.
We can ultimately decide if we want to

3389
02:45:49,181 --> 02:45:52,210
hit the reset button,
but if we hit that reset button,

3390
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:54,340
you know,
and end this game right now,

3391
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:56,600
we'll never get to play this turn again.
You know,

3392
02:45:56,601 --> 02:45:58,390
when,
then we get to be this person at this

3393
02:45:58,391 --> 02:46:00,730
time on this planet.
I can't say never,

3394
02:46:00,731 --> 02:46:02,980
but holds likely.
Most likely.

3395
02:46:02,981 --> 02:46:05,470
You never get to do a Redo of this exact
thing.

3396
02:46:05,471 --> 02:46:08,560
Maybe something similar,
but so what are you missing out on?

3397
02:46:08,561 --> 02:46:10,580
You're missing out on a unique

3398
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:15,140
opportunity to experience something
totally unique in that sense.

3399
02:46:15,141 --> 02:46:17,690
And so it's a real shame to do it,
but I think,

3400
02:46:18,020 --> 02:46:20,290
you know,
I think taking some of the pressure off

3401
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:21,910
that situation like,
oh okay,

3402
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:25,430
some people may want to hit that reset
button because shit sucks and that's

3403
02:46:25,431 --> 02:46:28,730
lamentable and it's an unfortunate
situation because of those things that I

3404
02:46:28,731 --> 02:46:32,030
mentioned,
but in my worldview that is just hitting

3405
02:46:32,031 --> 02:46:34,520
the reset button on the game and you get
a chance to play,

3406
02:46:34,940 --> 02:46:36,050
you know,
some other time

3407
02:46:36,690 --> 02:46:40,320
or you come back as well as poisonous
frog is in Topanga Canyon and fuck

3408
02:46:40,321 --> 02:46:43,320
people up.
That would be a motherfucker.

3409
02:46:43,350 --> 02:46:43,681
I mean,
you know,

3410
02:46:43,681 --> 02:46:47,400
with this idea that we always that
reincarnation,

3411
02:46:47,430 --> 02:46:49,980
you always come back as a person.
Imagine if not,

3412
02:46:50,340 --> 02:46:52,920
imagine if you will,
like you become a person,

3413
02:46:52,921 --> 02:46:55,530
a person.
Is that top of the food chain ideally.

3414
02:46:55,531 --> 02:46:56,364
Right?
All right.

3415
02:46:56,610 --> 02:46:59,220
So when you come back,
you come back as an Amoeba

3416
02:47:00,790 --> 02:47:02,610
and you've got to go through the whole
process again.

3417
02:47:02,790 --> 02:47:06,030
You had dies an Amoeba,
you come back as a multicell organism,

3418
02:47:06,031 --> 02:47:07,680
you die,
you come back as a slug,

3419
02:47:07,710 --> 02:47:11,490
death come back as a frog.
Death come back as a bird death.

3420
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:16,050
You're a dog death,
you're a chicken death death,

3421
02:47:16,290 --> 02:47:17,290
you go,
it doesn't know,

3422
02:47:17,370 --> 02:47:21,330
time doesn't give a fuck no,
and then there's multiple dimensions and

3423
02:47:21,331 --> 02:47:24,480
infinite universes.
Now you just keep coming back as new

3424
02:47:24,481 --> 02:47:26,670
things,
new things on other planets,

3425
02:47:26,671 --> 02:47:30,480
new biological creatures that we haven't
even begun to discover,

3426
02:47:30,720 --> 02:47:33,330
like the idea that if you live and die,
you only live in dying.

3427
02:47:33,330 --> 02:47:35,490
This one patch of dirt and that your
soul,

3428
02:47:35,491 --> 02:47:37,230
if that's a real thing,
your consciousness,

3429
02:47:37,231 --> 02:47:40,680
your entity,
your essence only transcends this body

3430
02:47:40,681 --> 02:47:42,720
and enters into another one like it.
You know,

3431
02:47:42,721 --> 02:47:47,721
in past life who queen or lived in new
people were fucking presidents or kings

3432
02:47:48,120 --> 02:47:51,450
like every motherfucker.
It was a president or a king in the

3433
02:47:51,510 --> 02:47:54,660
past,
a homeless person sucking dick for

3434
02:47:54,661 --> 02:47:58,110
homemade wine and all the fucking.
All the Gypsies are telling you that

3435
02:47:58,111 --> 02:47:58,680
Shit.
She's like,

3436
02:47:58,680 --> 02:48:01,530
Oh yes,
I see you at a great general like,

3437
02:48:01,531 --> 02:48:02,580
motherfucker,
come on,

3438
02:48:02,581 --> 02:48:04,440
come on.
How about I was a loser?

3439
02:48:04,920 --> 02:48:08,280
I would like to elucidate.
Or Julius Caesar,

3440
02:48:08,480 --> 02:48:11,550
the 7,000 Julius Caesar's from fucking
fortunate.

3441
02:48:11,670 --> 02:48:12,510
Oh,
I see you.

3442
02:48:12,511 --> 02:48:16,110
It was great.
Caesar leading the Roman as well.

3443
02:48:16,140 --> 02:48:19,020
People love this.
Love that whole nostalgia.

3444
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:20,370
I was listening to this one,
uh,

3445
02:48:20,490 --> 02:48:22,290
African American dude.
It was talking about.

3446
02:48:22,320 --> 02:48:24,610
He was talking about the history of
black people.

3447
02:48:24,611 --> 02:48:26,760
It's like we were kings.
That's what he said.

3448
02:48:26,790 --> 02:48:27,181
Like,
okay,

3449
02:48:27,181 --> 02:48:29,130
somebody needs to talk to you because
you can't.

3450
02:48:29,131 --> 02:48:31,500
Everybody can't be kings.
Do Kings work.

3451
02:48:31,710 --> 02:48:33,950
First of all,
kings are assholes and if you were a

3452
02:48:33,951 --> 02:48:36,360
king back then most likely fucking
killed.

3453
02:48:36,361 --> 02:48:38,850
A bunch of people were enslaving a bunch
of motherfuckers.

3454
02:48:38,920 --> 02:48:39,890
Exactly.
This idea,

3455
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:42,320
we worked things like how many,
how many of you were kings?

3456
02:48:42,330 --> 02:48:43,500
Did you go,
I'll get along.

3457
02:48:43,530 --> 02:48:46,200
Did y'all have separate kingdoms?
Did you all live in a community of

3458
02:48:46,201 --> 02:48:48,360
kingdoms?
Like what the fuck he talking about

3459
02:48:49,080 --> 02:48:51,990
Jesus Christ in the past?
No,

3460
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:53,540
we would love that.
We'd love to.

3461
02:48:53,820 --> 02:48:55,500
I will.
I'm really curious about that.

3462
02:48:55,501 --> 02:48:58,440
Like this longing for nostalgia.
Like what is that?

3463
02:48:58,620 --> 02:49:00,990
What people want to look to the past?
And you know,

3464
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I dated this girl a long time ago and
she was brutal in the fact that she

3465
02:49:06,450 --> 02:49:08,040
always distorted

3466
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:11,970
the past and made,
it sounds so amazing and so incredible.

3467
02:49:11,971 --> 02:49:13,010
And so,
you know,

3468
02:49:13,020 --> 02:49:16,710
like what you grew up in a broken home.
Your parents were abusive,

3469
02:49:16,711 --> 02:49:18,640
alcoholic,
so was like,

3470
02:49:18,820 --> 02:49:20,040
you know,
when we're together,

3471
02:49:20,041 --> 02:49:23,570
the love was amazing and they were
always together and they always know

3472
02:49:23,580 --> 02:49:24,540
they weren't,
they fought,

3473
02:49:24,541 --> 02:49:27,090
they threw glasses at each other like
Jesus Christ.

3474
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:32,240
Will you look at the life as what it
actually is in gain those possible

3475
02:49:33,811 --> 02:49:38,811
lessons from the actual truth of the
life instead of this romantic fucking

3476
02:49:39,451 --> 02:49:43,590
movie,
this strange reese witherspoon movie of

3477
02:49:43,591 --> 02:49:45,660
life.
Like somehow,

3478
02:49:45,661 --> 02:49:48,900
like people feel like they need that,
who they are.

3479
02:49:48,901 --> 02:49:52,890
It's built into like their own pride in
themselves having this thing.

3480
02:49:52,891 --> 02:49:54,930
But yeah,
just strip all that shit away.

3481
02:49:54,931 --> 02:49:56,950
I mean,
I think that the ego that wants all of

3482
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:59,130
these things,
once that passed and once this,

3483
02:49:59,490 --> 02:50:03,480
you got to just strip that little tyrant
and just like take all that armor off,

3484
02:50:03,481 --> 02:50:07,050
take all the bullshit off and let it
stand naked in the light of truth.

3485
02:50:07,050 --> 02:50:09,600
Just naked as shit out there.
Like,

3486
02:50:09,900 --> 02:50:11,070
you know,
get real,

3487
02:50:11,420 --> 02:50:13,950
get real with the elements.
I think it has something to do with

3488
02:50:13,951 --> 02:50:15,030
movies too,
man.

3489
02:50:15,060 --> 02:50:18,030
I think it has something to do with
literature and it's something to do with

3490
02:50:18,031 --> 02:50:21,470
our,
our creation of a narrative like our

3491
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:26,280
creation of these uh,
these lives that we read about and

3492
02:50:26,281 --> 02:50:30,990
watching films and we sort of apply them
to our database of what's possible.

3493
02:50:31,620 --> 02:50:32,520
And then,
you know,

3494
02:50:32,550 --> 02:50:37,500
you sort of like look back on some movie
that you saw that was wonderful and it

3495
02:50:37,501 --> 02:50:38,850
was amazing,
you know,

3496
02:50:38,851 --> 02:50:43,380
some really silly movie and you apply
that to your own past and you sort of

3497
02:50:43,381 --> 02:50:47,040
like trying to twist things around.
Especially when you're describing them

3498
02:50:47,041 --> 02:50:49,170
to other people.
You want people to think you had the

3499
02:50:49,171 --> 02:50:53,460
most amazing life but it never works.
It's sort of like name dropping,

3500
02:50:53,940 --> 02:50:56,130
like name dropping has the opposite
effect,

3501
02:50:56,480 --> 02:51:00,150
like it doesn't work,
like the idea that you are going to

3502
02:51:00,151 --> 02:51:05,151
somehow or another make people like you
more because you know,

3503
02:51:05,370 --> 02:51:08,010
you know Harry Belafonte or someone.

3504
02:51:08,190 --> 02:51:11,220
I don't know why I said Harold Bell,
where the fuck that came from?

3505
02:51:11,820 --> 02:51:14,550
Leonardo Dicaprio.
Really good friends with Leo.

3506
02:51:14,830 --> 02:51:16,590
You know,
we go to bars that you immediately think

3507
02:51:16,591 --> 02:51:19,050
that guy's a douche bag.
People assume that this,

3508
02:51:19,230 --> 02:51:23,010
the machinations behind what they're
saying are completely transparent,

3509
02:51:23,011 --> 02:51:26,280
but they're not like people.
Some people are blind to it and ignorant

3510
02:51:26,281 --> 02:51:28,140
and that's when name dropping work.
Like oh my God,

3511
02:51:28,141 --> 02:51:28,974
you're know Leo,
Blah Blah,

3512
02:51:29,130 --> 02:51:33,030
and they're just operating on that short
hamster wheel that's running full speed

3513
02:51:33,031 --> 02:51:36,870
and they can't figure out that he's has
some other compulsion that's causing

3514
02:51:36,871 --> 02:51:39,930
them to do this.
But then you meet somebody who has a

3515
02:51:39,931 --> 02:51:41,190
little bit of that,
you know,

3516
02:51:41,191 --> 02:51:43,500
wherewithal and it's just gross.
Like,

3517
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:44,880
Ugh,
what are you doing?

3518
02:51:44,881 --> 02:51:49,440
I see what you're trying to do.
That I see these hidden motivations and

3519
02:51:49,470 --> 02:51:52,380
I think that's kind of what we're seeing
in politics.

3520
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:54,300
We're seeing across the board,
it's like,

3521
02:51:54,720 --> 02:51:57,000
you know,
and so many different little gimmicks

3522
02:51:57,001 --> 02:52:01,020
that people play,
like even them saying when I'm president

3523
02:52:01,021 --> 02:52:03,090
of the,
they don't fucking believe that when

3524
02:52:03,091 --> 02:52:05,420
fucking Jeb Bush,
when present,

3525
02:52:05,421 --> 02:52:07,810
he doesn't believe it,
and you can tell you're like our

3526
02:52:07,811 --> 02:52:11,830
bullshit belief detectors.
Know that when he's saying he doesn't

3527
02:52:11,831 --> 02:52:13,840
believe it,
but you know who does believe it when

3528
02:52:13,841 --> 02:52:17,970
conor mcgregor says when they clash them
and I'm not gonna fucking head off he

3529
02:52:17,980 --> 02:52:21,580
fuck it believes it was Scottish.
He just fucked up the Irish accent.

3530
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:24,040
Irish accents.
Tough do.

3531
02:52:25,780 --> 02:52:26,613
Yeah.
He definitely.

3532
02:52:26,620 --> 02:52:27,453
Well,
he in that,

3533
02:52:27,570 --> 02:52:30,520
that you know,
that limited world of interacting with

3534
02:52:30,521 --> 02:52:32,920
bones and flesh and technique.
Yeah.

3535
02:52:32,921 --> 02:52:34,960
He,
he understands it to the point where he

3536
02:52:34,961 --> 02:52:38,500
really believes it and says it and I
think although probably believed it too

3537
02:52:38,501 --> 02:52:40,540
and some sort of fucked up way believed
him.

3538
02:52:40,600 --> 02:52:41,351
Yeah.
Yeah.

3539
02:52:41,351 --> 02:52:43,780
I think that's one of the things I think
when anybody's fighting,

3540
02:52:44,020 --> 02:52:46,000
it's not only a test of their
physicality,

3541
02:52:46,001 --> 02:52:49,840
it's like a test of their belief and all
of that squaring off and all of the

3542
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:51,280
stare downs.
It's like,

3543
02:52:51,550 --> 02:52:53,230
how much do you believe you're going to
beat me?

3544
02:52:53,440 --> 02:52:54,730
You know,
and most people probably.

3545
02:52:54,731 --> 02:52:56,590
Great champions,
they're in that 98.

3546
02:52:56,591 --> 02:52:59,050
They're pretty confident.
Connor just shows up straight.

3547
02:52:59,051 --> 02:53:02,760
A hundred hundred like denial.
Like you sure you sure?

3548
02:53:02,790 --> 02:53:03,311
Congress like,
yeah,

3549
02:53:03,311 --> 02:53:05,510
I'm fucking my favorite quotes of
Connor.

3550
02:53:05,730 --> 02:53:07,330
And he goes,
I'm number one.

3551
02:53:07,540 --> 02:53:08,920
He goes,
number one,

3552
02:53:09,010 --> 02:53:10,870
do you think like when they were
replaced,

3553
02:53:10,871 --> 02:53:13,480
Chad Mendez replaced Josie Aldo.
He goes,

3554
02:53:13,481 --> 02:53:16,510
I'm number one.
Do you think number one gives a fuck who

3555
02:53:16,511 --> 02:53:18,070
number two?
And number three is,

3556
02:53:18,220 --> 02:53:20,140
let them all come.
Let them.

3557
02:53:20,141 --> 02:53:21,460
Oh,
that was a bad Irish accent to.

3558
02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:23,200
That was pretty good actually.
I thought it was bad.

3559
02:53:23,350 --> 02:53:25,660
Fell in west La,
had deteriorated in the Middle Eastern.

3560
02:53:25,661 --> 02:53:29,420
Somewhere in the middle of it.
We're out of time,

3561
02:53:29,421 --> 02:53:30,760
man.
We just banged out three hours.

3562
02:53:30,761 --> 02:53:31,690
Beautiful.
Believe it or not,

3563
02:53:31,820 --> 02:53:35,710
I don't know how that happened.
That's the wonders of conversation or my

3564
02:53:35,711 --> 02:53:36,340
brother.
Always.

3565
02:53:36,340 --> 02:53:37,081
Good.
Good time.

3566
02:53:37,081 --> 02:53:38,890
Definitely.
We're out of time.

3567
02:53:38,891 --> 02:53:41,350
You fuckers,
but we'll be back tomorrow.

3568
02:53:41,351 --> 02:53:42,550
So,
uh,

3569
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:44,080
thanks.
Happy New Year.

3570
02:53:44,081 --> 02:53:45,670
Yeah,
I love you all.

3571
02:53:45,730 --> 02:53:46,990
Love you all.
Bye.
