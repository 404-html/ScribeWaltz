1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,370
Yeah.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,750
The Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by
[inaudible] dot com if you

00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:10,240

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,700
Click on the link for Alpha brain
and use the code name Rogan.

5
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:16,240
You will save yourself 10%
off any and all supplements.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,920
But we also have some new stuff in stock
and that is kettle bells and battle

7
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,830
ropes and they're pretty fucking bad ass.

8
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:26,800
We want to get yourself into caveman
shape. If you want to train like,

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,290
like Brock Lesnar does
in the countdown shows.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,280
If you want to do some manly man working
out or if your girlfriend has big boobs,

11
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,980
it's probably cool to watch
her do it. Oh, the ropes. Yeah.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,040
You don't want to watch the kettle bells.
You don't want it would have sharks.

13
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:41,130
Don't like slams amount of
chips around that bruises them.

14
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,400
If you've never seen kettlebells before,
you don't know what they look like.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,070
A cannon ball with a handle on
it. And then it's, in my opinion,

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,840
the most effective way to uh,
produce functional strength for, uh,

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,500
for martial arts, especially for Jujitsu
and Muay Thai. And things like that.

18
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,770
That's mostly what I do for
my strength and conditioning.

19
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:04,010
I do kettle bells and I do body weight
squats and Chin ups and stuff like that

20
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:08,920
and dips and um, just,
uh, it's a, it's a brutal,

21
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:09,940
brutal way to work out.

22
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:12,880
There's one DVD that I recommend
always to everybody if you can get it.

23
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:15,640
It's all sold out now because
I recommend it so much. Yeah.

24
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,890
It's called the extreme
kettle bell cardio workout.

25
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,330
This guy kicks your ass with
one Kettlebell. It's like
one 35 pound kettle bell.

26
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:24,820
It's fucking brutal.
You would think I'm a manly man.

27
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:28,450
35 pound Kettlebell kind of
a fucking pussy workout. Am
I going to get with that?

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,680
Trust me. You'll get a workout, a brutal
work. I would just body weight squats.

29
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:36,760
Just look up Hindu squats. Do 200
of them in a row and get back to me.

30
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,630
See what I'm talking about, bitch,
we're talking crazy shit here today.

31
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:43,450
I'm getting fired up, ladies and
gentlemen. All right. Because, uh,

32
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,560
James Bobo Fay is on the podcast.
We're going to talk some big foot.

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,590
You sons of bitches were going
to get down to the nitty gritty.

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,580

Rogan experience podcast. Sorry,

43
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,120

let's get this motherfucker started. Ryan,

44
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,620
she's actually a squash trash

45
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,670
fish or experience.

46
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,560
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

47
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,060
That's a new one. I'm not sure I like
it. That new fade out you do at the end.

48
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:43,840
You crafty devil. That's a squatch
trained dog. Ladies and gentlemen,

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,440
if you hear a dog or see a dog,
if you're watching us on Ustream or Vimeo,

50
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,920
and you see a dog in the background
that is actually a squatch trained dog.

51
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:55,750
And this is an official tracking squatch
hat. This is a gone squatch and hat.

52
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,250
Did you sell these?
Because if you don't,

53
00:02:57,251 --> 00:03:02,170
you should because it will show like
fucking I thought Animal Planet trademark

54
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:04,630
that they thought I
did. Oh, so nobody did.

55
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,590
Somebody else trademarking
some guy in Taiwan now. Oh,

56
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,100
those sons of bitches just fucking
sell it and make them sue you because

57
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,860
everybody would want an official
Bobo con squash and hat.

58
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,890
They sold tens of thousands
on a cafe press cafe.

59
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:20,410
Presto.

60
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,130
Like anybody could go on cafe press and
pretty much like make your own shirt

61
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:26,650
though, right? Uh, yeah. Uh,

62
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:31,180
last time I looked there was like
670 websites selling those hats. Oh,

63
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,820
that's hilarious. Dude.
You've created a, uh,

64
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,650
like you looking at your Twitter
right now. I fucking, oh, sorry.

65
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,590
I promised my buddy I texted when
it started because they're driving.

66
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,780
I can try and text him right now. We say
it's on, it's on. When I was a little kid,

67
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:51,190
I went camping with my parents. We
were, I was probably like six and uh,

68
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,210
we were in Yosemite and, uh, I
met a dude who was a trapper,

69
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,800
gave me like some,
some stinky fucking feet of like animals,

70
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,090
like killed like bobcats and stuff. But
when you're sick it's fuck it's bad ass.

71
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,360
Like whoa, this is cool. But uh, you know,

72
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,950
that's when I got obsessed with big foot
was talking to this guy cause he, uh, he,

73
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,740
uh, hundred percent believed in Sasquatch
is, and he, I remember it was just,

74
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:18,580
he was six.
I was six years old when he told me this.

75
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,770
He was just saying that
the woods are so dense.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,280
There's no way everybody's been to
every part of it. Nah, there's no way.

77
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:27,370
He's like, if you draw, if you
fly over the Pacific northwest,

78
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:30,460
I guess that's the only time where you
really get a true sense of how intense it

79
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:34,420
is. Because we kind of think of it
like, especially the Pacific northwest,

80
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:36,910
we kind of think of it
as like, you know, yeah,

81
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:40,390
they're Seattle and there's Portland
and there's some cities up there and I

82
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,250
guess there's highways dude.

83
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,590
A giant chunk of that is just
fucking dense rain forest.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,150
No, our people are not aware of
that. And that's where the, the Pr,

85
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,720
that's the majority of sightings
in America, right? Um, the most,

86
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,800
but what people trip on is they're all
their continent wide. They're worldwide.

87
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,850
How is it possible that
something can be kind and,

88
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,750
and the only video footage available
in 2012 is that shitty Patterson film,

89
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:11,380
Low Fat Patterson.
I think he's a fraud dude.

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,580
Know what happened. It was a camera.
You rethink Israel. You think

91
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,480
that was a very emotional response?

92
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,280
Say that if you were to search
or NASA, Delaware, the table. No,

93
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:28,650
I'm saying it wasn't Patterson known
to be a, a, a con man. I'm listening.

94
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,170
I believe firmly that Jane
Goodall believes 100% right.

95
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,340
There's a Sasquatch, I believe
very firmly. It's very possible.

96
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,260
I think that if they found one, all of a
sudden people would start, uh, you know,

97
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,120
it would make sense to people.
There's,

98
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,340
there's all sorts of
primates over this is planet.

99
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,020
And they know that gigantic [inaudible]
lived with people in Asia, right? Like,

100
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,960
you know, thousands and thousands
and thousands of years ago.

101
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,620
And the real legit scientists that,

102
00:05:55,621 --> 00:06:00,080
that talk about big foot say it's
possible that an animal came down with a

103
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:03,140
humans do during the Bering strait.
But you know,

104
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,160
realize humans are cunts. They're a
pain in the ass to fucking shoot Ya.

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,720
They stabbing, they make rugs. Any let's
hide, let's, let's go hide in the woods.

106
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,080
Show me a big animal that we don't kill
out in the woods. It's true. But how it,

107
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:17,740
oh, we would definitely kill one
for sure. Why there's a killed,

108
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,700
there's a guy who's on youtube right now.

109
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,730
I'm subscribed to the big foot
report on Youtube. You know,

110
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,340
whenever the new video comes up,
they'll send that guy.

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,690
But there's a guy who claims he killed
big foot. So he did you really think so?

112
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,733
I bought.
Does he have,

113
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,160
I bought that camera cause I wa I got
invited to go on the bottom of recovery

114
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:38,960
mission last year and a, it's a
real story, but where's the body?

115
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,530
What happened was,
I'll just give a rundown real quick.

116
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,140
I'm actually friends with the guy I
thought I'd never be friends with the guy

117
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,280
shot a squash, but he's shut the baby,
right? Yeah. Shot adult and a baby.

118
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,800
He first thought would happen.
They're doing, they're driving.

119
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,361
They were doing a huge,

120
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:57,050
when they just saw a warden and they were
duty turn way up in the Sierra Nevadas

121
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:00,580
but 8,500 feet and it was like Halloween
I think, or the day before Halloween.

122
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:05,390
Sierra Nevada's are in California.
Is that the huge mountains like Taco hub?

123
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,230
I just all the way down to the
Clara County. What is it? Yeah,

124
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,740
they run from current kind
of to like Oregon border
base. Okay. That area though,

125
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm like northern California, we're a
hundred miles long and 50 miles wide.

126
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,520
That's a big, big foot
siding area, right? Oh yeah.

127
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,430
So this guy didn't believe in big
foot or anything. He's total redneck,

128
00:07:22,431 --> 00:07:27,050
like kills it, like likes to just kill
shit out in the woods. Right. And, uh,

129
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,050
the big adult came out, was waving
his hands and wiggling his fingers.

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,320
They'll wave their hands and Lidl their
fingers just show that they're not bears.

131
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,510
We think they're pretty smart.
They're like people.

132
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,500
So he drives a beat on his buddy, had
just come back, just got a jacket,

133
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:44,400
just come back from Iraq and Afghanistan
combat vet and like he just was

134
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:47,400
overseeing stuff shot. He's like,
firstly say, don't shoot it. It's uh,

135
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,080
it could be a person in to see it.

136
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:52,100
And Justin was looking through the
scope and he's looking at it going,

137
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,680
it's not a person. He could see it through
the scope. It was, uh, it was a squatch,

138
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,860
but it wasn't one of those big buff ones.
He said it looked real frumpy,

139
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:02,190
kinda like saggy,
like wasn't sure if it was older or what.

140
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,420
So he's started squeezing one op and
when the thing realized he was going to

141
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:08,430
pull the trigger because
they were locking eyes,

142
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,580
he turned and he shot it through the ribs,
uh,

143
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,620
like lung shot. And it dropped, went
down like to a sprinter position,

144
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,660
then got up and sprint.
It's super fast,

145
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:22,110
stumbled once and then went
crashing down this Manzanita,

146
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,780
well they get out of the truck and
they're walking into their trip.

147
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,400
They never even thought of big fit.

148
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,060
They're walking out of their trip and
balls like they just saw a huge thing.

149
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,920
They call it a monster shot it,

150
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,920
it ran out there looking for them but
they heard it crashed out in the brush.

151
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,440
This guy's a registered bear hunting
guide so he said he could tell it,

152
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,620
you know that that was the
sound it makes when it crashes.

153
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,510
Well they get about 40 yard.

154
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,930
It was about 70 80 yards when he shot
it and they got about 40 yards there and

155
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:49,560
right where the thing was around two
identical twin babies like the size,

156
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,130
like three or four year old kids.
But with way bigger heads came out,

157
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,073
came out of the brush,

158
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,350
we're running around looking for lack
of the parent and they were running back

159
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,430
and forth cause he went,

160
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:01,770
he was going to shoot one of the babies
right off the bat and his buddy wouldn't

161
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:04,770
let him. I kept yelling, don't do it,
I'll kick your ass. You shoot that thing,

162
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,010
go shoot it.
Things are running around like 10 minutes.

163
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,180
They couldn't find the adult and they
realize okay there's two babies and they

164
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:12,630
were identical twins.
They'd run around,

165
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,870
they'd sniff the ground and look
around on all fours, like totally,

166
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,190
totally countable on all fours like
quadro pad, you know, just run around.

167
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,440
When they came near each other they'd get
up on two legs and they'd come up face

168
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,290
to face and he said they sounded
like too profoundly mute.

169
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,310
People talk and they go like
just real guttural sounds.

170
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,920
But like he said like a language
and they'd get back down.

171
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,440
They were moving down and they were
working their way towards where they heard

172
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,230
the body crashed and they realized,
well shit, they thought it was,

173
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,800
they shot the mobs like well if we just
shot the mom and then daddy's probably

174
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:44,400
around like this thing is eight foot
with a shot was probably eight foot tall,

175
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,000
600 pounds.
Hmm hmm.

176
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,850
Sort of thing. And we'll
shit, it's getting dark.

177
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:52,740
We want to go here and Jack and Justin
split up because they're covering

178
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:55,590
different territory and the one of the
little babies kept like bought without

179
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:58,070
Wallace and just still this rise.
We went to the spot with them.

180
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,700
We weren't like Doctor Meldrum went and
mine ski like you like the big name guys,

181
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,910
scientists. We went out there when
the snow melted the next summer.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are these the big name guys that believe
in big funds or no beliefs for shit you

183
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:15,510
can't see, right? Well they know it
exists. It's like people believe in Jesus,

184
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:18,870
but I never find like a Jesus heritage.
Jesus tracker, Jesus Shit in the woods,

185
00:10:18,871 --> 00:10:21,060
you know,
or where Jesus killed the elk or anything.

186
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:25,860
But what if you found
personally, so you're saying
historically one of the bags,

187
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,250
so then that would a dick,
I know

188
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,610
he feels bad now, but it could even
tell that story, you know? Yeah.

189
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,120
I had a film that you shoot a
baby. I know, Dude. Well he put it,

190
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,720
he wanted to prove the story was real.
He's just redneck dude.

191
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:46,440
That's killer shit for fine. That kind of
mindset, you know, he's not a bad dude.

192
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:49,260
That's just how he was raised.
And uh,

193
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,200
he's actually a smart dude when you get
to talk to him because you think he's

194
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,920
just some dumb shit redneck when he
talked to guys is pretty sharp dude.

195
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,780
Why didn't he take a video?
Why didn't they didn't have a camera?

196
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,130
They didn't have a cell phone with them.

197
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,100
I teach a pretty red nose and
12 yeah, this was October, 2000,

198
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,640
whatever. 11th 10th how could you
not have a cell phone? I do not.

199
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:10,980
I'm not justifying what he did.

200
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:14,970
I'm just saying I watched his video and
my bullshit alarm went off. Oh No, dude.

201
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,240
Well, I'll tell you.
I'll see what happens.

202
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,660
So he shot it and the thing
it rolled down the hill,

203
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,890
he picked it up and look and just
watched it die in his hands. Then he,

204
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,210
then his buddy started screaming at him.

205
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,630
He said he's stuck the body of this Bush.
They took off,

206
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:31,560
got out of there and they were on a
hunting website and one of our buddies,

207
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:34,380
Derek Randall is like, you know,
talk to him on the website, whatever.

208
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,900
Like there's like a chat room for hunters.
I was like,

209
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:40,140
I shot a couple of kind of jokes and
how would you mount a big foot and then

210
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,110
he's all, no, I really did. It really did.
He's all dude, you, you'll get that body.

211
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,960
I'll give you $1 million. Right.
But all you have right now,

212
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:49,320
it's just a guy with a story.
No, no. He came back and brought,

213
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,480
when he picked up the baby,
it bled on his boot.

214
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,040
There's blood on the boot from the baby

215
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:55,910
when they're,

216
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,210
they went back out there and snow like
three and a half feet and they're digging

217
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:01,420
six by six foot holes down to this.
Now they're out there for like a,

218
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,990
I forget what he said,
like eight hours digging,

219
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,380
digging and then there's
bloodhound they found where they,

220
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,530
they thought it was crashed, they found
it and like there's liquid mammal.

221
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,050
I was like how all the grease comes up
the ass like it at least like a greased

222
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,630
slick there.
And they found out there was,

223
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,230
it looked like a bear fed on it cause it
was just torn up and there was actually

224
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:23,760
some bear prints in the snow as they dug
and they'd say [inaudible] which does

225
00:12:23,761 --> 00:12:25,140
happen. Dan, any animal.

226
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,190
When was the last time you
saw a dead deer in the woods?

227
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,110
They don't last very long.
If they're,

228
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:33,480
there are a couple of days
something finds it. Oh yeah.

229
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:35,490
It starts getting torn up
and then like road and seat,

230
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:39,880
the bones porcupines eat the
bones, whatever. And so, um,

231
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,950
where was I to lead?
How puppy found a chunk of meat and flash?

232
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,780
He couldn't tell. Look, it looked like
the same colors he got and it was like a,

233
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,250
like a girl.
I saw it.

234
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:55,240
It's like grayish white with brown mixed
in like kind of multicolored and it's

235
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:59,470
weird course hair and it matches.
Anyways, that is the, the the,

236
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,030
the catalyst of the center piece of
the DNA study is that piece of meat.

237
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:06,220
That's the first one they got
cause it snowed right on it.

238
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,410
That was the first hold.

239
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,880
And what does it have they
done an analysis so they've
mapped the whole genome.

240
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,560
What is it?
It's a,

241
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:18,010
what the guys that are working on it
called is a relic hominid and it's not a

242
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,910
gigantic,
Pittsburgh is really so,

243
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,200
so there are 100%
convinced it's not a chimp,

244
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:27,130
it's not any other kind of
bad word. Word, word lead.

245
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,230
Cause this guy that has done this study,

246
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,370
it's a woman named Melba
Ketchum and there's a lot of
controversy around her and

247
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:34,900
there's some weird stuff
about her for sure.

248
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:39,760
Like things she's done in Saje crazy.
Nah, I don't know. Bed. She's a woman.

249
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,110
I was glad you said that.
How many cats does he own?

250
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,440
How many crystals around her neck?
She's cool,

251
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,920
but she's a g Jeanette glass
has a big genetic lab. She
anyways, she's well known.

252
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,280
And what's her, what's the issue
that people have with her? Well,

253
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:57,680
because she had to come up
with new, um, God what it,

254
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,370
I don't want to start talking
to each teeth when I read it.

255
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,060
I understand that people like the
scandal was it? No, no, no. She, uh,

256
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,780
well I'll just say this from that.

257
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,960
Now Oxford University is doing a study
over in England on the same, they,

258
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,620
I think they're getting some of
the, I mean, I'm not sure exactly.

259
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,550
I hear stuff from different people and I
was just with the guys that are running

260
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:22,120
the DNA project this last week, last
week, I just slept in two days ago.

261
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,350
And uh, but um, there's
other labs that are,

262
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,450
do you have to like go through
peer review and they have to like,

263
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,280
you give them a sample,
they do the same test,

264
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:35,170
but she had come up with
these new techniques that
hadn't been used before. And,

265
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,980
and so the other labs that authenticate
that then replicate the process and you

266
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:43,020
had to replicate it twice each other lab.
And the word is,

267
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,120
and like there's other scientists getting
onboarded cause it words leaked around

268
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,530
in the community of those
type of geneticists and stuff
is that it's, it's real.

269
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,210
Like there's, it's, it's
really close to human.

270
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:56,630
Like where's chimps and gorillas have 98,

271
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:59,360
98.1% the same amount of
d the same DNA we have.

272
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,630
These are 99.59 9.6 the samples from age
of the Yeti's or 99.4 to nine or 9.5.

273
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,790
So what are the Yeti samples?
What would they proven to be? Uh,

274
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,320
well that was the thing was that
there's these genetic markers there.

275
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:17,030
They're really similar to, they're,
they're like a type of PR people.

276
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:21,340
Like they're there the whole,
that evolutionary chain
they have, you know, his,

277
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:25,550
his way out of whack and aware that
there was this much conclusive evidence.

278
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,740
So I'd never even learned this before.
Yeah.

279
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:32,360
People do talk about it on the show that,
you know, it's so aggravating. It's,

280
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,720
it's, um, it's real frustrating
because we were like,

281
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,430
you guys never put any real science in the
show. They're like, they're like, yeah.

282
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,920
And I used to get in fights with them
and I actually quit the show a bunch of

283
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:46,810
times. Like Susan, why like
in between season one and
season two, you really? Yeah,

284
00:15:46,811 --> 00:15:49,730
I was, I was, I was like, this isn't
what I signed up for. You know,

285
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:53,290
like some hokey asked, what would
you say? What did you sign up?

286
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,620
They wouldn't like a, we got some,
you know, uh, audio, we've got some,

287
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,810
we've got audio and stuff captured and,

288
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,010
and when you run through spectographs you
could rule out, you can rule stuff out,

289
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,291
you know,

290
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,890
and a lot of times you'll get left with
the only thing that matches it would be

291
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,950
like a, like a howler monkey
or something or given,

292
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,360
and then it goes out of range
of that even, you know, the,

293
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,930
my favorite story is Les
Stroud from survivor. Oh yeah.

294
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:18,764
Survivor man.

295
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,630
That dude was in Alaska and apparently
he was on a remote island and the Alaska

296
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:27,620
for folks who will know it as more than
a thousand islands last is a fuck load

297
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,600
of islands, temperate rain
forest in the southeast. Well,

298
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,490
he was camping there.

299
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,000
He's doing one of his survivor of things
where he stays up all night and you

300
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:39,500
know, sleeps in a tent and makes
his own food. I mean it's really,

301
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,610
it shows amazing. I love the guy. Anyway,

302
00:16:41,611 --> 00:16:45,990
he was in Alaska by himself and he started
hearing primate noises. He heard like,

303
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,963
Ooh,
Ooh,

304
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,230
loud something that didn't sound
anything like a bear. And he's like,

305
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:55,140
this was like very distinct primate.
And he said,

306
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,580
then I started to make some movement
and when it realized that something was

307
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:04,080
there, ran hard and fast are the ones
he goes, I don't, don't know what it is.

308
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,570
But it was big and it was heavy and it
ran through the woods and it sounded like

309
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:12,220
it was making primate noises.
I said it to him, it was a,

310
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,980
it was a real animal. And he suspects
that it's probably big foot, you know,

311
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,180
and he's a guy that goes to these really
remote places in stays for days and

312
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:22,014
days.

313
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,110
And I think he's got it in his head how
there could be an animal like that that

314
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:30,240
lives completely outside of human contact.

315
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,300
And even in 2012 as he discovered just
this guy story sounds like bullshit.

316
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:39,420
I watched a story. I've watched him talk,
watch him talk about shooting the, the,

317
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:43,320
the thing that it was a baby. I was like,
dude, you're an actor. This is nonsense.

318
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,790
This is, I don't buy, I didn't buy it

319
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,210
or it takes a lot of grief, man. He's
not, and he's not making any money off it.

320
00:17:48,211 --> 00:17:50,040
Like they're doing a book it and
he's done it. And all of them

321
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,700
are crazy. People check this out. When
I took them out, when we went out there,

322
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:57,480
monkey loves like she's playing with
big victory for up and Bluff Creek.

323
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,670
I didn't actually see her playing with it,

324
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:02,820
but it's the only daylight setting I
ever had was the same day she was in the

325
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:03,960
brush in that same spot,

326
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,450
run around and I could hear something
huge running back and forth.

327
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,490
And when she gets excited,
she hates,

328
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:11,490
she got her ribs all brook by a bear when
she was a puppy and she hates mountain

329
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:15,300
lions. Wow. And uh, where he
said he's stuck the baby's body.

330
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,750
She like, she'll never hear him make
a noise. She doesn't bark or anything.

331
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,170
She meant maybe playgrounds a little bit,
but she doesn't bark in a whole week.

332
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:25,410
We were up there. The only time anyone
heard her make any noise was when he said,

333
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,280
yeah,
I still it over that Bush.

334
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,650
And she was just walking around stiff
and she went over that Bush where he said

335
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:33,410
he's stuck the baby body and she went
crazy and started digging holes and like,

336
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,810
did you guys try to figure out if it
was there to try and dig it out? Yeah,

337
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,880
we had cadet like um,
uh,

338
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,510
Dr measurements set up for some cadaver
dogs to the Smithsonian and stuff like

339
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:46,880
that to come up. It was like a full,
we had professional trackers and um,

340
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,960
the cadaver p we had two
different sets of cadaver dogs.

341
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,530
They wouldn't do it because if it
was a funny part was, is the lady,

342
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,690
it doesn't search and rescue in
the mountains with the dogs too,

343
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:55,710
like body recoveries.

344
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:59,070
And she was certain there that Sasquatch
has lived there and she didn't,

345
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,170
and it wasn't like, I don't
want to do it. That's crazy.

346
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,510
I don't want to be involved in
something that's not real. She was like,

347
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,110
if it is Sasquatch and you try and my
dog picks up on that set and tracks it,

348
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,040
it would like a,
it wouldn't ever train track humans again.

349
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,450
They only track one thing. Those
cadaver dogs. Really? Yeah, absolutely.

350
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:16,991
Definitely.

351
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:21,420
His handlers track a Sasquatch then
they wouldn't work for humans anymore,

352
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,890
so,
but yeah,

353
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,430
but if you've got a dog that was trained
to track squats as you probably dog

354
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,790
wouldn't live long. If it caught up to
him, you think they would eat the dog.

355
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,120
They've, they've been known to kill
dogs like real pretty frequently. Yeah.

356
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,390
Really aggressive dogs. Even dogs
were just mind their own business.

357
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:40,260
They've killed him. No Shit. Yeah, but
dogs barking. Getting aggressive though.

358
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,490
People say they'll see him kick him. Just
know that anyone that's had their dog,

359
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:49,320
Sasquatch. Yeah, they see it. They see
it happen. I talked to these natives.

360
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:54,030
We were down squash it on the hickory
Apache reservation in New Mexico and they

361
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:58,710
had one called the porch and they were
there. Uh, the female dog was a Pitbull,

362
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,200
was gardener. Publish had like,
they were like four weeks,

363
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:04,120
six week old puppies and they're up
on the site and the store is morning.

364
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,050
The kids are watching cartoons, getting
ready for school, eat breakfast,

365
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,520
and the thing walked up on their porch
and the dog was snarling and snapping and

366
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:15,240
just walked up like that. It's like,
and just crushed it, broke it's back,

367
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:19,590
like crushed it and then stomped
all the puppies and walked away.

368
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,570
Whoa. Stomped a puppy. So big. That's a
Douche bag. I think there are like people,

369
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:28,500
yeah, Alex, summer, total dicks.
And most of them are, are I now,

370
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:31,740
what is the most conclusive evidence
you'd think it's that Patterson footage

371
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:35,270
because I think that footage is horse
shit. I take it you're tripping. Nah,

372
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,040
you're so wrong.
You're more wrong than you know.

373
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,930
Do you know that that guy was arrested
for riding a fake check to pay for the

374
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:46,990
very camera that he used to Fisk
finish that film. That, okay. You're,

375
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,190
you're talking about Greg longs

376
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,750
book, which is what I'm talking about.
Which was this total, is it not true?

377
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,620
He was, uh, he, he had some
financial difficulties,

378
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,760
difficulties for sure.
Bob Gibson,

379
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,000
the guy that was driving him
and the in the Apache Indian,

380
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:03,310
the tracker guy and the
guy's a legend dude. He's,

381
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,410
there is one guy who is come out and
said that it was a hoax and then he was a

382
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,940
part of it. Right? That guy's a liar.

383
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,510
Told here's some drunk neighbor guy
that used to hang out with them. That,

384
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,960
that um, was Roger and Bob were
real popular. The Roger Patterson,

385
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,670
Bob Galen [inaudible]. They were like
expert Rodeo riders. Um, Bob Gibbons,

386
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,160
the baddest dude you'll ever meet.
Dude,

387
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:26,800
he was the number one ranked welterweight
in the world when I got in a serious

388
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,310
car wreck. And that his career,
he's in the Rodeo Hall of fame.

389
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,300
He's like the best tracker hunter
you ever saw sobbing. The guys.

390
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:37,270
He's 81 he's still out there like
breaking horses and roping and,

391
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,870
and what part did he play in
this? He was, he was the guy,

392
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,660
he was the other guy that was
with Roger when they filmed it.

393
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,080
Roger Patterson wasn't a con man. No,
because I've read that he was a con man.

394
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,730
This guy put this heat as arrested
for writing bad checks. Yeah, he,

395
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,750
cause he was so impassioned with the
project and like he knew that there was

396
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,580
real and he was just thought he,

397
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,610
well his brother in law was
supposed to be finding this stuff,

398
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,450
this guy out the athletes. It was a
millionaire up there and he kinda,

399
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,510
he was like his brother in law, like,
you know, crazy Roger running around,

400
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,960
whatever. I think, you know,

401
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:17,650
and he was his partner on this and then
he was supposed to be putting funds in

402
00:22:17,651 --> 00:22:19,060
and like it didn't happen.
It wasn't like,

403
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,100
it wasn't like Rogers is total calm
man. He was like, everyone, people,

404
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,760
we've talked to them and
say he's a good dude.

405
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,190
And he w he purposely went there to try
to find a big flood and he was there

406
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:33,700
filming fresh tracks. They were there
to film the Blue Mountain. Trackway.

407
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,833
What does that mean?

408
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,410
There was some sets of tracks that
people had found big foot tracks. Yeah,

409
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:41,600
there was to try to find a big foot.
Um,

410
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,600
at that time they were just
looking for fresh tracks.

411
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:46,570
I never thought they'd see it,
especially in the day. Well, listen man,

412
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,490
nobody wants to believe
big foot more than me,

413
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,240
but when I look at that video footage,
it looks fake. Dude, you're tripping.

414
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:56,590
Let's say a guy in a monkey suit. I'm
just pull it up, Brian. Pull it up.

415
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,600
You're way off chirping. Do you think it's
a real big foot, Brian? No, it's real.

416
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,360
I saw, I saw one of the daylight.
Well, I'm not listening.

417
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:06,190
I'm not saying that the files are real.

418
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,860
I'm not saying that at all by any
stretch of the imagination. Look,

419
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:10,810
Jane Goodall beliefs big for Israel.
She's,

420
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:15,460
she said she believes 100% that there
is some undiscovered primate in the

421
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:18,910
Pacific northwest. I believe those
were as global her exact words.

422
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,310
What should I look up? Bob
Patterson, big foot footage. Uh,

423
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:26,500
Roger Patterson,
Patterson.

424
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,740
Gimlin stabilized Patterson.
Big Foot footage.

425
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,920
I'm sure it's going to put up stabilized
cause he wants it. Oh that's it.

426
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,630
It's funny. Mexican
border, big foot footage.

427
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,230
His and a fucking bag of traffic.
That's a,

428
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,340
they talk to a border patrol agent though.
That was tracking some coming across

429
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,390
and saw big foot down the mountains down
in Arizona. Really? Okay. No stable.

430
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,700
Yeah. Original footage. Um, okay.

431
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:58,490
For one thing,
let's watch she's walking.

432
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,710
If you could say that's not stabilized.
Yeah,

433
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,880
they're going to stabilize it
in a sec. Okay. Okay. Right.

434
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:07,730
Let me just spit back suit.
Dude.

435
00:24:07,731 --> 00:24:12,731
You're so off the top expert as in the
world like chambers that made the the,

436
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:16,770
um, okay. Right. Let's see back a little
bit more. Her foot. They have a dope.

437
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:19,520
If you look at that cash, they have a
double ball foot and you can see it.

438
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,200
They just found this recently right there.

439
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,520
Yeah. You'd have to pause it. Pause
it. When she's picking her foot up,

440
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,180
it's her left foot going down. It's a
total girls over there saying, oh dude,

441
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:37,390
hitters, big hairy ass tits. Let's,

442
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,740
I would love to believe that. That's
a real big front. I really would,

443
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,570
but it will be soon.

444
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,590
Okay.

445
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,490
Nah, it is. It's it's
way bigger than a human.

446
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,520
It's does.
Do they do the things that you guys do?

447
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,970
That's one of the things I really enjoy
about your show is that when someone has

448
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:55,240
a a video that they think it's big foot,

449
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:59,600
then what they do is they sent Bobo out
and bubbles always bigger because you're

450
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:00,350
a big dude,

451
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,870
but you're always bigger than the the
what they thought was big foot except for

452
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:06,860
coming up this season. One of the
episodes coming up. Oh really? Got One.

453
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,280
It's way bigger than what they got.
Smart season two they wizened up.

454
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,810
You know a lot of those people
just want to be on TV, right?

455
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:17,670
No. A lot of them. You don't think a
lot of those people with their stories.

456
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,300
There was one guy I remember a little bit.
Most will, what happens is we go there,

457
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:24,230
right? Like we're, we have like
a network all across the country,

458
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,940
like big foot researchers.
There's like a lot of like academics,

459
00:25:26,941 --> 00:25:28,770
cops like fishing game officials,

460
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:31,320
like people that are seen on
themselves and like they get into it.

461
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,350
Have you seen in yourself?
Yeah. When have you seen it?

462
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,780
The last one I saw it funny. The guy just
called me was with this guy, uh, Jamie j.

463
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:43,360
He was your step maybe Black Hawk
down? Yes. He was the real life dude.

464
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,800
The fifth third squad leader that
shot their way out, like Kimra,

465
00:25:46,801 --> 00:25:49,680
that rescue house and came out and met
up with him and then ran out front and

466
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:53,320
shot his way up. Me and that guy
were up there and is where I saw the,

467
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:57,750
my only daylight setting. It was right
on Bluff Creek or that was filmed the PG,

468
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,710
the parish agreement films. Films.
Really? Yeah. You saw one there? I saw it.

469
00:26:01,711 --> 00:26:02,280
That's the one I,

470
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,830
when monkey was playing that day and
the brush or I thought she was gonna get

471
00:26:04,831 --> 00:26:08,400
killed earlier in that day. The
wonders I saw. What she was staring at.

472
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,740
It was leaning out behind a tree and I
saw lean out behind the tree for like

473
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:12,540
just that fat,
this was gone.

474
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:16,110
I walked up there and you can just smell
that smell is one of the only times

475
00:26:16,111 --> 00:26:18,210
we're really smelled that smell
real thick. You hear about,

476
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,940
cause I haven't smelled that.
Black people always talk about that smell,

477
00:26:20,941 --> 00:26:24,900
but I want you to call them skunk
apes. Yeah, we think it's like a,

478
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,610
like a secretion gland. Like they can like
if they get agitated or scared or mad,

479
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:32,040
it'll seep out and like over Millennia,

480
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:34,950
human brain is when that
pheromone hits your brain,

481
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,180
it just causes total fear
reaction. Really. Yeah. That's

482
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,230
interesting.
So it's like,

483
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,900
you know what p a lot of people
don't realize is that like um,

484
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,990
the parts per million that a dog can
smell of a person is very similar to what

485
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,270
you can smell from a skunk.
Right.

486
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,440
It's really interesting because you really
think about how strong a skunk smell

487
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,800
is. The you're in your car with the
windows rolled up and you're driving like,

488
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,000
oh fucking skunk that's outside.
It's outside,

489
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,130
nowhere near you and it
just a little tiny squirt.

490
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,360
Well a dog can smell a person
like that. That is a trip, man.

491
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:14,050
That's a wild thing to think of.
If we have a reaction to these things,

492
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,950
some primordial reaction to these things,

493
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:20,430
and that gland is just like a skunk gland,
just like some,

494
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,490
something that squirts out of to us is
like really distinct. Right. Probably all,

495
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,530
probably all animals through that smell.
What was it like to you?

496
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:33,000
Like what was the smell like, if you
could describe it? Um, it was it possible?

497
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,250
Yeah.
I'll tell you this.

498
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:37,670
I walked through it to another time where
it was real thick or had just walked

499
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,301
in front of us.

500
00:27:38,301 --> 00:27:41,630
Like we missed it by minutes where it
walked into broad date across the meadow

501
00:27:41,631 --> 00:27:45,740
and uh, hickory Apache
reservation. I smell it there too.

502
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,940
It was like they'd be like from here to
the wall and you can walk through it and

503
00:27:49,941 --> 00:27:52,310
you'd just be like, uh, and
like if there's no wind, right.

504
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:53,960
Cause both these times there was not when,

505
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:58,961
right then it just hung so thick
and it was like real musty,

506
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:03,680
like a Musk and it was kind
of sour kind of sewage.

507
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,880
He smelled like wet,

508
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,030
like wet dog mix was like bear of when
a bear comes out in the spring when you

509
00:28:09,031 --> 00:28:11,420
smell a bit of smell bears when
they come out of hibernation,

510
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,600
like that kind of smelly,
stinky animals.

511
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,190
Fucking real funk but and like
nut and you would not when people,

512
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,170
cause I didn't smell it for a long time.

513
00:28:21,171 --> 00:28:24,300
I was around him a long time
till I smelt one. Like I,

514
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,650
I'd seen them and heard him around
me before I'd ever smelled one.

515
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:32,570
What's the first time you saw on the
first one? I saw it was May 21st,

516
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:36,190
2001 where? Up in humble up in the
bald hills. And that's where you from?

517
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,610
I'm from down here originally. We went
up there in the 80s. It's nice up there.

518
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:45,170
Oh yeah, that's beautiful. So I,
I was with this, uh, these, uh,

519
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,800
this cop and this probation officer guy.
And then my buddy I left,

520
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,050
I was all excited about
these guys and I had,

521
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,470
I had just bought a gen two Ukrainian
knight's scope. That's when night vision,

522
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:57,050
all that stuff was super expensive.
It was like a real,

523
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,600
nowadays it just be a piece of crabby,
probably buy one for 100 bucks.

524
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,990
But I'd never had one before. So I
was of like little cheap, you know,

525
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,980
big five ones. And I left on the porch
when I was packing my truck to go out.

526
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:11,330
We're going to go squatch and for a
week. And uh, my buddy drove it up to me.

527
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,640
We were only there 20 minutes and
it's a long story, Dude. I know.

528
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:21,370
It's okay. It's um, well, five
nights before that I'd had my,

529
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,030
my first first.
Sure.

530
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:28,031
Like on an unambiguous Sasquatch and
counterparts scared still to this day,

531
00:29:28,041 --> 00:29:32,540
it was scariest moment of my life.
Like ours not didn't see him,

532
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:36,440
but I saw like when they ran, when
they bluff charged me, there was like,

533
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,130
it was pitch black but you could just
see black on black movement like,

534
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:43,570
you know what I mean? Like you
couldn't make out any, any form.

535
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:45,400
But it was just a big black
couple of black shapes.

536
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,730
Like it was like there was gaps in
between the trees, a starlet behind,

537
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,541
there's just like,

538
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:53,080
but there were so it was just like a
black blur and they ran on both sides. Me,

539
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,580
um, I've been doing house and growls
and identify all the time and never had,

540
00:29:57,581 --> 00:29:58,270
never had,

541
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:02,950
in hindsight when we were logging up
there like probably about seven years

542
00:30:02,951 --> 00:30:06,190
earlier, six years earlier,
further down that ridge line.

543
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,950
We've been logging there one summer
and they'd come around as much.

544
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:11,210
But I didn't realize what they were doing.
I thought it was Indian.

545
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,060
I thought it was pot grower
Indian dudes that there,

546
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,450
cause we were off the Rez and there'd
be Knox and whistles in the morning and

547
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:17,680
the Indian dudes wouldn't
get out of the truck.

548
00:30:17,681 --> 00:30:20,040
But I like these dudes were like
the baddest dudes in the resin.

549
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,590
No it fuck with these guys.
And like if someone's going to,

550
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,470
they'd be confront whoever would
like these dudes were gnarly barley,

551
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:29,740
Indian lager trees and would just sit
in the truck and knock it out until the

552
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:32,680
sun came up because we'd be up there
and sharpen their saws and stuff,

553
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:35,710
getting ready and just kind of stretching
a little bit and just getting ready

554
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:38,620
for the day and they wouldn't get out of
the truck of those whistles and knocks

555
00:30:38,621 --> 00:30:42,820
going to sit in the truck. So I'd been
around but didn't know it. And uh,

556
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,803
but this time it was,

557
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,020
they kid I was doing house and this
thing came from the north. I don't,

558
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,690
when you say you were doing house
for folks who haven't seen the show,

559
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,770
you imitate like what you've heard and
recordings and when you, what, you know,

560
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,870
they believe our primate Howell's
tribute to big foot. Yeah. So you can,

561
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,640
there's a bunch of those you
can find on the Internet.

562
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,000
And I was doing those and all of a sudden
I thought I heard a wolf Hollenbeck or

563
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:06,390
like a wolf cross hybrid.
My buddies,

564
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,430
everyone needs to have like a
while back and seven eights wolf,

565
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,100
Husky and they don't listen to you at all.

566
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,220
And I thought it was one
of those things and uh,

567
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,820
it was coming down the ridge and it has,
it made some weird,

568
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:20,770
sounds like almost like
more coyote kind of sound,

569
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:23,530
but that sound and then I'll just
never forget it. It kinda want,

570
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:25,690
it sounds sorta like mine but different.

571
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,290
It sounded way more primal and
just gnarly. And it just goes,

572
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:33,760
I just remember every hair on my
body shut up. My son went, Holy Shit,

573
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,930
I'm actually having a big fit.

574
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,600
And countering the things had been
walking towards me at that point had been

575
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,420
walking at me for probably 20 minutes.

576
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,600
I could hear it coming closer and
closer and it was just so loud.

577
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:47,410
I was carrying forever. I was looking
down over the Klamath River and um,

578
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,040
it just, and when it came into the tree
line, I was sitting in this meadow,

579
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,640
I was like, there's a dirt road
that runs along the top of the hill.

580
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,420
And then the left side is,
um, redwood national park.

581
00:31:58,421 --> 00:32:01,750
And on the right side it's Timberland
and there's a few ranch in holdings,

582
00:32:01,751 --> 00:32:06,250
all family and holdings in there.
And I was sitting up there and I was,

583
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,390
uh, this Indian woman, there's
a little Indian village,

584
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,980
knew of this dirt road about 12
miles down. Said she'd saw one.

585
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,830
And when I was talking about my Chapati
jump freight us that day on the phone,

586
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,870
he said it was real.

587
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,810
This is like cell phones and
humble back then were like real,

588
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:21,640
unless you were right in the middle
of town, didn't work too good.

589
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:26,010
And I heard him say, yeah, May 21st,
you know, about a woman's sought,

590
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,820
we'll run across the road.
Right. And I knew were shoot,

591
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:29,700
cause we logged up in there.
I knew that whole area.

592
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,340
I knew exactly where he was talking
about. It was a big deer. And Elk meadow,

593
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,980
so I was like, okay shit,
I know where that is.

594
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:39,560
And I was like jammed up there and I had
the nights because I sat there and this

595
00:32:39,561 --> 00:32:42,390
thing came into the tree lag. I started
in these crazy roars and screaming,

596
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,160
snapping trees and it was,
this thing was huge, gnarly,

597
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:50,150
just I couldn't live when it came to
the tree line to my right and my two

598
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,990
o'clock position. So that was like, it
says like if this is the dirt road here,

599
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:56,720
there's this metal that's
kind of a crescent shape,

600
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:01,250
half moon and there was a little timber
stand here, brush and timber right here,

601
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,020
and then there's a dirt road behind here.

602
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,160
I was sitting on the other side of the
road facing the meadow with my night

603
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:09,800
scopes and then this beach
chair look about this way.

604
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,080
This thing came in to hear it by
nine o'clock I was facing this way.

605
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:15,140
This is Kevin might nine o'clock
and right when it did it like this,

606
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:16,490
craziest Roran snap.

607
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,970
This tree from over here at two o'clock
was this gnarly power, not just our rack.

608
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,260
They'll take a branch or something and
just bash the tree or a stomp or whatever

609
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:26,250
we call them power and actually do that.

610
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:29,220
Or would Knoxville are lighter
but just as full 90 product boom.

611
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,210
Just to let you know they could do that
in your head. Right. That's what they did.

612
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:35,310
If they were ever going to kill him when
they would have killed me that night

613
00:33:35,311 --> 00:33:39,990
because, or they're musicians, they're,
they have a really primitive band.

614
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,930
Nuts. I've asked a lot of
natives about that. Like,

615
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:46,680
cause they come around tribal dances
and stuff and I've talked to you. Yeah.

616
00:33:46,681 --> 00:33:48,750
They'll keep the noise down.

617
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:54,060
They'll like kind of dig on it.
They dig music. Apparently the, the,

618
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,150
from what I've heard, they don't
make any kind of music. What does it,

619
00:33:57,151 --> 00:33:58,990
what did they sound like?
Like what does the house,

620
00:33:58,991 --> 00:34:03,720
I'm like the house gave us a version
of the [inaudible] my, my version.

621
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,470
It only did mine once from what happened.
Should I do it? Yeah, of course.

622
00:34:07,471 --> 00:34:09,540
I get like a little bit,
yeah, that's good. It's good.

623
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,500
Like a hit and I reckon your law,
uh

624
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,700
wow. But I do it louder. If
we were outside it was um,

625
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,780
the videos that are rather the audio
recordings that some people have gotten of

626
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:30,980
a, of screams in the woods that they have
identified as priming. Right. You know,

627
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,600
where,
where was that that they got those?

628
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:36,740
Cause it's pretty all over the
sounds like there's Zuri Mississippi,

629
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,400
Florida. How come numbers game and
pictures of them man, they just,

630
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:43,460
they're shitty pictures and cameras
don't work like the human eye. Right to,

631
00:34:43,461 --> 00:34:47,690
it's like your eye focused
so quick and it whenever you,

632
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,810
cause they're so used to getting shot
at and they see a shoot at everything I

633
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:54,200
think. But I think they know what cameras
are but when they see something come up

634
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,170
they're just gone.
Like they're not sticking around.

635
00:34:57,171 --> 00:34:59,750
They're not going to sit there.
But there is videos,

636
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:03,080
there's a lot of videos but it is like
we know people that have gotten them but

637
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:06,050
you can't tell him it's just so
shitty, low quality, low Rez.

638
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,440
Like they're almost always in the shadows.

639
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,720
Like it'll be bright outside
then they're in the shout out.

640
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,410
People aren't using high
quality gear cause it you,

641
00:35:15,411 --> 00:35:19,010
if you hadn't personally had an
encounter at a certain point in time,

642
00:35:19,011 --> 00:35:21,860
you have to look at all these different
people with their shitty photos and the

643
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:24,710
things that don't,
that don't really look like a big foot.

644
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,430
You're showing you these,
there's a lot of hoaxers and crazy people.

645
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,200
A lot of people. Right.
Well Moses for sure hooks.

646
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,690
There's almost not a knowing
that you're dealing with,

647
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:37,010
you're in a business where half the
people were full of Shit, let's say being,

648
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,870
being nice guy.

649
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:42,660
I think that's being nice. That
research. Bigfoot? No, no. Not Research.

650
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:45,900
Big Foot that have claimed to
have seen him I think. I think,

651
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,700
I don't think half of them are full
of shit. No Way. Cause there's,

652
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,750
I've talked to over 4,000 people that
have seen him and maybe a hundred or 200

653
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:55,580
we're trying to bullshit me.

654
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,720
Only 102 hundred really because this
is before I was on TV and stuff mostly.

655
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:02,100
You know what I mean? Like I
just be talking about, you know,

656
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,211
people in the community.

657
00:36:03,211 --> 00:36:05,670
Like I've talked a couple of my
professors when I was going to school,

658
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,110
I had seen him, um, we did all kinds
of people. We did this thing once.

659
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,960
You can't trust it once you put it on TV,
like your show right now.

660
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,760
Like I see people that raise their
hands and I'm like, this motherfucker,

661
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:22,650
this shit up as town hall meetings. When
did you see a big player? I'll fucking,

662
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,480
they just like you could tell some,

663
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:27,800
some folks will just make shit
up to get on camera. And a,

664
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,580
I did a show for CBS wants,

665
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:33,090
it was called game show in my head and
one of the things we did was we would

666
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:37,420
show up somewhere pretending
to be a real news crew. And um,

667
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,800
the assignment that the contestant had
was you have to get someone to agree to

668
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:46,800
have seen something that they
didn't actually see because uh,

669
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,620
your witness took off
and it's a Ufo sighting.

670
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,350
So you have to get someone tell them
you're going to put them on the news and

671
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,920
say, listen, I, you know, I was
a, we were about to film this guy.

672
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:58,380
Do you think you could pretend
that you had seen the Ufo?

673
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,850
Every fucking one of them said yes.
It was crazy. You could tell though,

674
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,130
you couldn't tell man.
What do you watch the playback?

675
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,090
You couldn't tell they were bullshit.

676
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,910
It was no different than listening to
people. And you show talk about big foot.

677
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,080
There is a difference though because you
know what's funny is a lot of um, we,

678
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,510
we deal with a lot of law enforcement
will cause they'd go out to rural

679
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:16,740
residents is like breaking,

680
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,730
it's like stealing chickens or
freezers like big foot steel.

681
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,720
Chickens are omnivores and uh,

682
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,710
a lot of cops watch are the Guy John
Friend is a cop was out before he,

683
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:33,740
he's certified federally to be a
deception expert when he trains other law

684
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:39,360
enforcement agencies. And uh,
we've heard like other, uh,

685
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,130
police training and she's like, well
they teach them like, uh, uh, deception.

686
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,680
Like what to look for when
people are lying and they watch,

687
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,620
they watch our show for the witnesses
and they said they're surprised at how

688
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,030
they aren't lying.
Almost all the ones they see how more?

689
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,760
Three cause I bet that guy sucks at that.
I don't know other ones or other, other,

690
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:01,470
other, other like other people
that did instruct on them
better. That shit. The Nim

691
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,230
I could just see Roscoe Pico.
Yeah. How much rain, you know,

692
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,230
expert in the laws in the
hearts of deception. Oh, Ross.

693
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,220
On the Sni by me. The Duke was, um,

694
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,740
like if that kind of, if that kind of
officer said I was a trained professional.

695
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,840
How many times have you been
out on a show? Right? No

696
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,890
though where you're going with
the witnesses and you go, man,

697
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:28,450
I think this guy might be full of shit.
Not We just did. Um, well I can't,

698
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,510
I can't tell you what, which ones
haven't. I don't think none of the,

699
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,730
none of the ones that we aired. And
Dude, if someone was pulling a prank,

700
00:38:33,731 --> 00:38:36,110
believe me,
they'd be growing up not pulling

701
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,280
the prank. Just they're crazy
and they want a friend instead.

702
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:42,970
They have a big foot story. Yeah. Oh
we get, there's some of that for sure.

703
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:45,370
But you know, we, we don't put those
people on a show. Like they might,

704
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,960
they might show clips from the town hall,

705
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:48,400
but we don't go out to
their spot with them.

706
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,320
And a lot of those guys
would go out with like,

707
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:52,720
they've already been
vetted like several times.

708
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,680
Local BFR investigators have gone there
with the person and gone over the old

709
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,600
siding.
Although we did have,

710
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:02,590
we just did one on the show where we're
pretty sure that we don't know for sure

711
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,290
what we do. The guys were pretty
sure that he was a line, you know.

712
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,820
Well if you guys are sure that guy
was lying, I bet he's fucking lie.

713
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,120
Like moneymaker those. I,
you've seen the show, right?

714
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:17,500
Moneymakers just real stairs out. I'd be
like, you know, just thinks it's funny.

715
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:20,350
That is his name. First of all,
it's real name is Matt moneymaker.

716
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,680
That's hilarious. Dad's a famous
bankruptcy attorney here in Beverly Hills.

717
00:39:23,681 --> 00:39:26,590
They enrich moneymaker.
That's even funnier.

718
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:30,450
Rich money made the bankruptcy attorney,
I mean,

719
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:34,840
if you were going to have a Coen
brothers movie and it was going to be a

720
00:39:34,841 --> 00:39:39,700
plotline, didn't involved a big foot TV
show, you guys would be perfectly cast.

721
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,590
You know, you blow the Sasquatch
expert is always bigger than the video.

722
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,980
Matt moneymaker,
the guy's name is moneymakers that alone.

723
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:51,850
It sounds like a character. It's
awesome. Yeah. You guys all get together.

724
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:56,350
Like how did this show gets started?
Um, I hooked up with Matt, uh,

725
00:39:56,620 --> 00:40:01,300
through, well he runs the BFR bro. I don't
know if you've ever looked at website,

726
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,650
bigfoot field researchers organization.
It's got like 50,000 sightings on it,

727
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:09,760
whatever. And it was real hard to
get him back then. Like, you know,

728
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,080
and I was just like whatever.

729
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:15,220
Fishermen lager guy didn't have any
credentials or anything like that.

730
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:18,100
But I always went out and I knew a lot
of the natives out there and I worked in

731
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:20,680
the woods out there and I spent time out
there and I talk to people and I just

732
00:40:20,681 --> 00:40:24,450
need to lay of the land. So I hooked
up with this guy, John Frayed is,

733
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:27,670
and then I was like a volunteer, whatever
it would be a far off for a few years.

734
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:29,830
And then in 2003,

735
00:40:29,831 --> 00:40:32,680
they were filming that show mysteries
and counters on outdoor left network.

736
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:36,370
It was Matt, not, I'm not in if ever.
So I was just one season. But uh,

737
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,240
Matt and autumn,

738
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,210
we're on it. And then I was on
like three episodes of that.

739
00:40:40,211 --> 00:40:44,790
We were cruising around in northern cal
and, um, uh, then he made me like, oh,

740
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,720
whatever investment you have to get,
you know,

741
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,640
you had to go through steps
being an investigator.

742
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:52,030
Like you gotta know what you were
talking about. And maybe now there's,

743
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,890
there's definitely people
that are in the BFR now.

744
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,660
There's like several hundred
people across countries.

745
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,160
It's good cause it's a broader net,

746
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,430
but some of the people just
don't have the woods experience.

747
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,930
Like when they go out
there, they don't, uh,

748
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,170
like people misidentify stuff all the
time. Like, you know, a lot of the stuff,

749
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,320
a lot of stuff I gotta do
appeal to some of that.

750
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:09,400
I'm a big foot action out there.

751
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:14,401
You get out there and it's a bobcat and
he or there's a barred owl moved in and

752
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:17,100
you know, at some bar dot. Yeah.

753
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,500
Could be just stuff like our bear,
whatever.

754
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:24,010
But I'll say this for all the Times that
people say they saw big foot and it was

755
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:27,310
a bear. I'll bet you there's way more
times where people saw big foot and go,

756
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,230
I just saw a weird bear, right? Because
they brang came in process big foot,

757
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,130
especially before sixties.

758
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,280
There's my buddy Scott McLean lives
right down here in Santa Monica.

759
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,230
He's compiled that he's putting a book
out and it's all like pre 1950 newspaper

760
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:42,501
accounts.

761
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:47,501
He's got like 1500 of them from North
America back to the 17 hundreds of people

762
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:51,260
reporting orangutans because it was
before gorillas were discovered that wants

763
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:52,850
to,
gorillas were discovered,

764
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:56,330
people the description switched
from orangutan to gorilla.

765
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,580
Would they compare it to, or a wild
man? There's wild man stories like,

766
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,810
um, up in humble, they call them,
the loggers call them. Uh, since, uh,

767
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:09,050
since the 18 hundreds. Wood,
apes and brush apes. There's,

768
00:42:09,051 --> 00:42:13,100
there's a 137 names up and down
the west coast with monkey or ape.

769
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:17,450
And then they like Monkey Creek, Ape
Canyon, Monkey Ridge, eight ridge.

770
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,830
Like they're all over the place.

771
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:23,000
And they'd get that name because that's
where the brush shapes lived. Jesus.

772
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,670
How fucking cool would it be if
they actually got some real fudge,

773
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:31,970
some real honest to good at goodness.
You can't fuck with it.

774
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,950
And at least my phone one footage and,

775
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:38,951
or quote captured one or captured a
Sasquatch tracked one and dragged it out

776
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,960
there. There's footage. They won't
release it. We just went there.

777
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:45,770
We did an episode there. Uh, I
won't release. No, it's a tribe.

778
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,020
They got on a security
camera behind the casino.

779
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,880
What and why won't they release
it? Dude, it's, it's super heavy.

780
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:58,280
Uh, the squatch to the
natives is, um, listen,

781
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,650
anything for money, liquid they did
with these, they'll take the money.

782
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,770
They set up casinos down there. They seem
to offer him some cash. Xavier. Now do.

783
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:10,870
There's certain, there's some tribes,
there's a few tribes like that,

784
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:13,550
but most of them that there's still old
people in charge that like they listen

785
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:17,480
to them about that kind of stuff, like
cultural stuff. So the Sasquatch video,

786
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:17,900
if they,

787
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,440
that's their culture that you would
never be able to release a video of it.

788
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,440
It's funny because I've talked to some,

789
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,730
some tribes where they
said that that it's,

790
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,570
it's signifies the end of the world is
Sasquatch has brought in like captured.

791
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,520
Yeah.
It'd be like,

792
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:39,530
that's like their life has gotten so crazy
that someone caught a big foot or you

793
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:43,610
know, brought in a body, whatever. Well
now this guy who I think is full of shit,

794
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,260
he was telling the story
about shooting the baby.

795
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,300
Why wouldn't you just bring
a piece of it with them?

796
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:49,940
Why would you cut off a finger if he's
willing to cut killing on these fucking

797
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:53,840
things? Like it's a, like it's a dog
or like it's a coyote or something.

798
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:57,310
He just take the blood to
another blood DNA per person.

799
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,660
How Crawford's in at that
point his buddy came over,

800
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:06,030
was super pissed at him for shooting it
and then they were starting to trick was,

801
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:09,440
is at this point getting really dark
and they're just going like, okay,

802
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,380
there's gotta be another bit.
It takes two to make babies.

803
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:14,580
There's gotta be another
big one. They let he, they,

804
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:17,240
they definitely regret not bringing it
because they could have brought the baby

805
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:20,000
line weighed like 30, 35 pounds. Like
that doesn't make any sense to me.

806
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:22,790
I don't believe him. It sounds like
horse shit. It sounds like horse shit.

807
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:23,870
The guy doesn't have a photo of it.

808
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:26,300
He shoots a big foot and he's not
going to bring something to it.

809
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:27,980
There's no way you would
bring nothing back.

810
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,470
But they map the genome of that sense of
that flush sample he brought in. Yeah.

811
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,160
But that's some shit

812
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,630
they found there after the fact.

813
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:36,830
He didn't take it facility and
bring it with them. Right? Yeah.

814
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:41,190
There's no direct chain of custody.
But um, did, you can't argue DNA. Well,

815
00:44:41,191 --> 00:44:44,490
if you really do say that the DNA has
been mapped and it is something new

816
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:49,070
hominid but isn't the woman crazy?
That's DNA. I'll say. I didn't say that.

817
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,410
Well I mean that there's at least that
at least there's some controversy about

818
00:44:52,411 --> 00:44:55,950
it or some controversy. If there's any
controversy, just take it to like a,

819
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:00,850
like a regular DNA map and starting
like a known company. There,

820
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:01,780
there is,

821
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,320
there's other and the other labs are
coming up to the same conclusions as her.

822
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,730
What's her name? Melba.
Melba. Mel Lba Ketchum.

823
00:45:09,731 --> 00:45:12,760
K. E. T. C. H. U. M. She has like,

824
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:17,320
I guess like DNA diagnostics
done in Texas, but we just,

825
00:45:17,321 --> 00:45:20,110
we went to a genetic lab
recently with some, um,

826
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,210
some hair from that back when that
whole thing that, you know, the,

827
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,860
the video he told you about the video
with a 10 foot big foot walks up to the

828
00:45:26,861 --> 00:45:31,630
dumpster. The things about 10 foot.
Yeah. Where was this? Um, Oklahoma.

829
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,880
We got, I never got to
see, but I don't, I,

830
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,830
we know people that have seen
it and they didn't get it.

831
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,340
Why haven't you gotten to see it?
It's it's,

832
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,480
it's locked in the vault and the
tribal chairman won't, won't really,

833
00:45:42,481 --> 00:45:45,490
it won't let anyone even see it anymore
because what happened was word leaked

834
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:47,770
out. There was a big foot,
there was Bigfoot's anybody.

835
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:50,260
You go to this place in Oklahoma, it's
what they traveled. The river routes.

836
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:50,891
They follow the rivers.

837
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:54,130
There's thick brush and bogs along
the rivers and they've traveled that

838
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,540
especially at night and this casino
was near. It was near enough to that.

839
00:45:58,541 --> 00:46:00,140
They'd come up there and they're,

840
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,310
they're real cut around natives because
natives don't shoot that. I'm very odd.

841
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,700
It's rare for a native to
shoot at a squash. They
respectfully leave them alone.

842
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,610
They'll put out food for him
and leave is what they do.

843
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:12,280
They don't have any photos of him either.
Some,

844
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:17,320
some have the upper up in Humboldt there
was a family of some local Indians that

845
00:46:17,351 --> 00:46:20,800
shot footage. It's about from 400
yards away and it's looking down there.

846
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:25,300
They were out scouting elk and it's
a female was feeding down in the,

847
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,080
in the bottom some kind of
vegetative matter. I'm not
sure whether it was eating,

848
00:46:29,081 --> 00:46:30,940
but she was digging something up.

849
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:35,710
Like it might've been some kind of
root and they filmed it for like 13,

850
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:38,490
14 minutes. But you know, it's like
400 yards away with the things,

851
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:41,980
probably about seven
foot tall and 400 pounds.

852
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:47,800
So this woman who Ms Ketchum,
who's uh, doing this, this,

853
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:50,140
this study, uh, it's,

854
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,990
she's apparently putting it out for peer
review. Is that what's going on? Yeah.

855
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,810
So she's made the peer reviews going on
the, yeah. Or her conclusions are done.

856
00:46:58,811 --> 00:47:02,530
The peer review is going on right now
in Oxford University is one of the labs.

857
00:47:02,531 --> 00:47:06,520
It's in on the DNA study now. There's,
um, I can't say, I mean that's their deal.

858
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:11,230
I can't, I can't say, um,
what other labs are doing it.

859
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:15,130
But you'll, you would know
the names. There's a, there's
a big public university,

860
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:19,710
one of the guys who runs the genetic park
department's doing it and, and their,

861
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,820
their initial results
or they're blown away.

862
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:27,070
There's a picture of a big foot back.
It's the best picture.

863
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,960
I think that was fake.
It's a fig. I Dunno,

864
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:31,840
I might not be,
I think it is.

865
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,660
What if [inaudible] fleets were
born very big and they only like,

866
00:47:36,661 --> 00:47:40,850
we're big like one day and they grew
really small hole. Shut the fuck up now

867
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:48,120
nigger backwards or something just broke
every person's brain who's listening to

868
00:47:48,841 --> 00:47:52,930
this thing they're not from or dare you
be.

869
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,810
So your,

870
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:59,490
your first encounter came after you
were already obsessed with big foot.

871
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:04,260
Totally. What became, what started
it off? How did you become obsessed?

872
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,830
I told you my story. I talked to a
trapper and he told me it was real.

873
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:09,150
Then I was really freaked out.

874
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:14,010
I saw the Patterson Gulen film, like
on some TV show when I was about five,

875
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:18,400
because I remember I, I had just started
kindergarten and I could get, uh,

876
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,310
I could take books out at school.

877
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:24,240
At that point I was looking
for bigfoot bucks and it just,

878
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:28,530
just caught you, like you would just
mess with it. Yeah. And then, um,

879
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:32,160
I was that, I grew up down here. I was
a surfer and all that and you know,

880
00:48:32,161 --> 00:48:36,220
skate punk and, uh, after high school
I was going to, I was doing it,

881
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:40,320
I was piloting outer can is if, you
know those Hawaiian canoes, outriggers.

882
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,400
I was racing those and we were like the
top team in the country and you know,

883
00:48:44,401 --> 00:48:47,160
doing like world championships and all
that stuff. So I stayed down here longer,

884
00:48:47,161 --> 00:48:49,710
but I was wanting me to humble
because I was in a surfing.

885
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,580
I like big waves and there was big foot
and big surf up there and I was like,

886
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,960
man, places killer. I'm going there.
So I moved up there and I started, uh,

887
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,580
did some logging jobs and started meeting
people in the community and worked

888
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:05,190
with some natives and kind
of got in more and more.

889
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:07,680
I just really started delving into,
like, if I heard about a report,

890
00:49:07,681 --> 00:49:11,370
I'd go check it out. Um,
talk to whoever I could.

891
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:13,170
I'd like big foot shirts or hats.
I'd,

892
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:18,060
wherein people country to
go believe in big foot, you
know, you know, I'd say yeah.

893
00:49:18,061 --> 00:49:21,080
They'd say, uh, I saw on one time he like,

894
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,900
it was crazy how many people you got in
rural areas, how many people, and it's,

895
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,290
there's so many,
there's so much hard data form,

896
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,450
like where you live with the
sightings are, it's generally 90%,

897
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,490
90 plus percent of the sightings, over
90% of the settings are, you can fall.

898
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:36,000
It's like a,

899
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,600
you look at it where there's 20 inches
of rainfall or more like theirs.

900
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,960
That's where they live. Yeah. Yeah.
And there's like, there's a bell curve.

901
00:49:42,961 --> 00:49:46,750
What you'd see, what the natural
occurring animal for like foot size. Um,

902
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,740
without God, I should have
brushed up on this. He said,

903
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,100
I said to think about saying something
stupid on the front of the camera.

904
00:49:53,101 --> 00:49:54,660
When I'm doing big foot step at a,

905
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,900
well, there's a lot of possible
a, you know, when you, when you,

906
00:49:57,901 --> 00:50:00,360
as soon as you start saying you
believe in big foot, it's going to,

907
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,700
it's impossible to, you know,
to have everybody take you
seriously. Right. You know,

908
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,430
let's fuck those people there. They're
the wrong, well eventually it's going to,

909
00:50:08,431 --> 00:50:12,720
if it, if it is a real thing, someone's
going to get something conclusive. Right.

910
00:50:12,721 --> 00:50:15,240
And they're able to justify,
well, what's the most,

911
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:18,160
what's the most conclusive thing besides
the Patterson footage that I think it's

912
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:23,161
bullshit that just the enormous amount
of footprints that have been cast for the

913
00:50:24,061 --> 00:50:25,930
folks on Ustream. He brought me a, uh,

914
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,560
a replica of the best footprint and it's
fucking awesome if that really is a,

915
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:33,470
a from an animal.
Holy Shit is that think big.

916
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,470
Yeah. And I'm actually, I got a,

917
00:50:35,471 --> 00:50:39,570
I got a copy of the ha it left a knuckle
mark to where it stepped up over a um,

918
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:43,690
uh, like a four foot step up. It went
up and put its knuckles on the ground.

919
00:50:43,691 --> 00:50:46,900
I got that out in the car check at Shea,
but she, those little rich patterns,

920
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:48,920
only living flashlights like those red,

921
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:53,150
a cutout foot or like a fiberglass mold
would not leave that ridge pattern in

922
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:57,700
that moisture. Right. This, all this stuff
right here. The national flag. Yeah. Yeah.

923
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,650
I mean, any tracker, I'll tell you that.

924
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:00,943
Wow.

925
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:05,620
So this do you think is a for
sure legit big foot footprint.

926
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,500
Oh yeah. It's considered the best one.
It's the best one without clear journals.

927
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,070
And that was cast by a deputy Hereford
and graves county, Washington.

928
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,700
And when you say

929
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,680
creek cleared dermal is
for folks who don't know,

930
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,100
that's one of the most conclusive pieces
of evidence for the people that the

931
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:24,101
scientific community that support the
idea of a giant primate is dermal ridges

932
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:28,010
that you have like similar
to fingerprints, you
know, you have those, uh,

933
00:51:28,011 --> 00:51:30,230
on the bottom of your foot.
And these,

934
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,990
these animals actually leave
these in some of the tracks,

935
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,950
which would be incredibly
difficult to replicate.

936
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,000
Do they? Jimmy Chilcott, he,

937
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,160
he talked the FBI labs in Quantico,
Virginia.

938
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:46,370
Like when you go through the academy,
he's the latent fingerprint expert,

939
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:49,730
blah blah. Well, they were trying
to see like when they found just a,

940
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,410
like a gun at a murder scene,

941
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:56,411
there's prints on it and that just no
matches that he was the guy that you used

942
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:57,530
for 15 years.

943
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:01,660
He went around and fingerprinted
and footprinted every prime it,

944
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:06,560
he couldn't zoos research labs
and printed thousands of gorillas,

945
00:52:06,561 --> 00:52:10,220
orangutans, monkeys, chimpanzees, blah,

946
00:52:10,221 --> 00:52:13,010
blah Gibbons.
And uh,

947
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:17,270
so after all this time it was because
since they have a smaller gene pool,

948
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:19,850
they don't interbreed was the
idea was they were trying to see,

949
00:52:19,851 --> 00:52:24,851
was there any pattern discernible like
Asians are Africans or Europeans or

950
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,470
native Americans. Like if they just
found a gun with a fingerprint,

951
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:32,000
was there any thing that would,
that would show it's from like what race?

952
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,470
At least it was right. And the answer
was no. But as a result of that study,

953
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:40,460
he became the world's leading expert on
primate compensate us. Wrong, dramatic,

954
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,420
dramatic God. Dramatic Lipsticks,
dermal ridges. It's terrible. Yeah.

955
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,680
Right. Can I get a little tongue tied
of them? Some of that stuff, but uh,

956
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,950
I can spell it, but um, and so anyways,

957
00:52:51,951 --> 00:52:55,250
he's testified in court for like smuggling
cases, you know, people bring it in,

958
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,950
they'll say, no, the sound
was born here and he'll,

959
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,510
he can go ahead and show
the fingerprints Bot.

960
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:01,760
And so he studied the tracks and he's,

961
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,820
and this guy has put people
away in over 400 capital cases.

962
00:53:04,821 --> 00:53:08,390
He was the expert witness is where
the evidence was fingerprints.

963
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,600
And he went on on
discovery channel and said,

964
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:15,530
I stake my professional reputation
and name on that. These are genuine.

965
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:18,410
There's an undiscovered
primate leaving these tracks.

966
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,080
And even when people are saying
like, well, you just opened up like,

967
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,160
you know yourself to like have it
like, or these 400 you've gotten. Now

968
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,180
the defense lawyers could say this guy
is crazy. What? Right. And he goes,

969
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:33,120
I can prove it in court. So he's not
even worried about it and it hasn't,

970
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,610
he hasn't had to,
but he said he could.

971
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,610
The uh, what's interesting to me is, uh,

972
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,670
the idea that there could be
an undiscovered animal, uh,

973
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,230
and that,
uh,

974
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:50,520
someone someday is going to bring it
in just like they have with this, uh,

975
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,150
the big chimpanzee that was a ledge.
Congo.

976
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,770
It's called a bondo actually, but no bowls
or the, the little ones like regular,

977
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:02,250
like a cousin to regular champion.
They fuck a lot.

978
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,060
They're horny ones.

979
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,680
Bondo apes are these giant
chimps or ability bill it. Yeah,

980
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:14,100
yeah, yeah. They're um, in a part
of the Congo, um, which really,

981
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:18,340
really fucking hard to get to.
And since the 19 hundreds,

982
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:20,160
there was stories of these big giant,

983
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:23,580
great chimps and that was from the
Michael Crighton movie, the Congo,

984
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:26,880
they actually depicted these things in
there, these big giant and they'll walk,

985
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:31,260
try sometimes. Yeah. Yeah. This is a,
they're called lion killers of time.

986
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,780
Exactly. Yeah. They, they
have two words for champs.

987
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,960
They called him tree beaters or
lion killers and there's some chips.

988
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,280
They have photos of dead ones.
I mean,

989
00:54:38,281 --> 00:54:43,281
these are real legit 100% real
primates that are still a like very,

990
00:54:44,341 --> 00:54:46,590
very controversial. It's, it's still,

991
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:50,040
there's a lot of people that didn't
know they existed until the 90s were,

992
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:54,600
weren't sure til Karma. Carl Armaun,
who's a Swiss wildlife photographer, he,

993
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,090
he, um, got some evidence,

994
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,410
some bones and some stuff and then
became obsessed with it and started going

995
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:06,030
there. But he has camera trap photos of
them. They have a total of 2000. Exactly.

996
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,410
Exactly.
They brought back some classroom casts.

997
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,040
Like those that weren't even as good
as this. Right. And there's more,

998
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:15,010
there's more evidence for
Sasquatch than those, those, uh,

999
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,930
Billy apes really well.

1000
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:19,500
There's actual real good
photographs of these all the apps.

1001
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,160
So high hazard there is, um, but the,

1002
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,700
but the point is that for the longest
time people were saying that this was

1003
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:30,480
bullshit and now they know
100% that this is real.

1004
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:32,950
And the Congo as people living in it,
you know,

1005
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:37,140
they ain't nobody live in when these,
they're too much. So up in that area,

1006
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:41,010
they're just pushing their, now, you
know, there's still tons of virgin timber.

1007
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:45,090
They're cutting down up there
and the Congo. So huge too.

1008
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:46,770
Another thing that people don't realize,

1009
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:52,010
it's like literally almost as dense as
the entire distance between California

1010
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:57,900
and New York. Like there's that
much Congo. It's fucking enormous.

1011
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:02,640
I noticed that. Yeah, I might be wrong
about the country, but the Congo, Congo,

1012
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:07,440
the Congo jungle, the rain to
talk about the country. But yeah,

1013
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,740
the Congo base,
that,

1014
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,890
that animal being something that was
mythological and now is a real thing.

1015
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:16,920
There's that give you guys hope. Does that
like make big, big foot people that go,

1016
00:56:16,921 --> 00:56:20,880
yeah. See Bitch, you could see this some
shit out there that you couldn't find.

1017
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,040
I used to be pretty militant,
like sometimes

1018
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,010
violent and my defense of
the Sasquatch existence,

1019
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:30,160
but I don't even worry about it.
I've seen him and I know,

1020
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,520
I know there's enough tissue samples
and they're now getting exam.

1021
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:35,560
There's so much going on.
Um,

1022
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,140
there's a lot of hair experts
getting in on the hair cause it, uh,

1023
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,540
I'm not sure what exactly what it is,

1024
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:42,310
but some about the platelets
where they line up,

1025
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,310
they've gotten better microscopes or
something that they can see him better.

1026
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,070
I'm not sure what it is, but the, um,

1027
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,760
these hair experts are getting really
into the Sasquatch here because it's

1028
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:56,740
unique. There's nothing that matches
it at, and it's, and there's the, um,

1029
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,330
there's just certain characteristics
about Sasquatch or it's like every sample

1030
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:02,920
that's legitimately,
it's handed in and it's not,

1031
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,250
it doesn't try to be horse or bear or
whatever, but every sound gets turned in,

1032
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,740
has these same characteristics.
And there's a,

1033
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:12,850
there's a joint study going on like
different experts in that field who are

1034
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:16,540
working around like from different
countries even that are all examine these

1035
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:19,990
hairs and like marking these markers and,
and uh,

1036
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,290
it's like they're real excited about it.
You know,

1037
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:27,750
it's really going to be interesting when
the skies are filled with drones and

1038
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,990
drones can take images of
anything anywhere they want
at anytime and they just

1039
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,270
fucking send them over
the Pacific northwest.

1040
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,920
They already kind of have that
with everyone having cell phones.

1041
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:39,220
That's just the thing that
I just don't understand if,

1042
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:41,530
if there's so many people
that see this and there,

1043
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:45,200
there's still no photos and then
there's photos and like the hair,

1044
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,870
the hair and the blood
and everything like that.

1045
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,840
I know that it doesn't take that
long for it to get the, you know,

1046
00:57:50,841 --> 00:57:53,150
for them to say, you
know, this is deer blood.

1047
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,970
This is so and so blood
that this is something. But,

1048
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:59,990
but if they're all saying that it's
unknown, then why are you, have they,

1049
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:05,080
has there been multiple agencies that
have put out reports about this or is

1050
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:09,240
there any, you know, these teams
you're talking about sun like, like,

1051
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:14,400
like, like if there's been so many blood
samples and hair samples and they're,

1052
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:19,130
they're all being tested and they can't
find out what this blood is because they

1053
00:58:19,131 --> 00:58:21,740
could, it doesn't take that long
for them to take blood and go,

1054
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:26,090
this is deer blood, you know, so,
so if they're all saying like, hey,

1055
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:27,740
we don't know what this blood is.

1056
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:31,640
Have they been giving out like
statements or press reports or you know,

1057
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,240
stuff about this. Is there, is there
information out there about them saying,

1058
00:58:35,241 --> 00:58:36,740
we don't know what this blood is?

1059
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,751
Yeah,
there is.

1060
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:42,460
But you got understand is like the
science world is so political and so

1061
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:44,050
backstabbing and so,

1062
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,410
and they're so afraid to like do something
unconventional cause you just get

1063
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:51,670
barred in the field that they're real
reticent to like do stuff like that.

1064
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:55,180
But there are some that have like Dr
Fehrenbach and some others that have,

1065
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:56,950
and there's others that
look at it and they won't,

1066
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,340
there's a lot of people who work
in the bigfoot field anonymously,

1067
00:59:00,341 --> 00:59:03,790
like other scientists that collaborate
with them that just don't want to deal

1068
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:08,590
with any ridicule or get not get
promoted or whatever it may be.

1069
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,170
I watched a documentary where a doctor,
uh,

1070
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,810
some sort of a professor at a
university was talking about, um,

1071
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,480
the fact that even though he supports
big foot, he does it very reluctantly.

1072
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,510
He supports the idea big foot exists.
It goes because quite honestly,

1073
00:59:23,511 --> 00:59:26,030
until one's discovered it
until there's conclusive proof,

1074
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,180
he says it's just a point of ridicule.
It's just one of those things.

1075
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:33,580
Talk about Doctor Meldrum and auto state.
I don't know where he's from. Uh, he's,

1076
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:37,010
and he's just, he's a genius. He's written
like four books on the foot anatomy,

1077
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:41,690
how humans have gone from Quad,
how like back, you know, evolution,

1078
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:43,550
how we went from Quadrat pad to buy pedal.

1079
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:47,960
He's like the foremost expert guy
in the world on that. And, um,

1080
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,100
he was actually one of the guys at the
body recovery site with us when we went

1081
00:59:52,101 --> 00:59:55,280
up in there and he, he believes that
he believes the shooter story also.

1082
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:57,770
He was there like everyone that
goes there, that guy, yeah.

1083
00:59:57,771 --> 01:00:01,370
Everyone that was there that, that's
there that week came away believe in him.

1084
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,600
Why did he bring something back?
It's silly.

1085
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:09,080
I'll tell you later off
the air. Okay. All right,

1086
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,810
well there's some sort of a secret ladies
and gentlemen and I can't share with

1087
01:00:11,811 --> 01:00:13,790
you. That might be the
answer to this whole crazy.

1088
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:18,890
It just would answer some a little bit.
Well they were,

1089
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,570
they were,

1090
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,050
they were pounding beers and they had
just saw that word and a guy and they

1091
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:26,210
didn't want to, like, they were,

1092
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,400
they have a drive to get back
to camp and they had it, they,

1093
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,730
the dude was afraid to get uh, like a
DUI or something cause they, you know,

1094
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,670
whatever, we're out in the woods
like, you know, just drinking beers,

1095
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:40,280
driving around out the track,
whatever it was described.

1096
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,090
And those are the guys that
shot a pig foot baby. I know,

1097
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,120
well the only the one guy did,
the other guy was anti the whole time.

1098
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,820
And other than that,
like what is a,

1099
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:53,120
what is a good piece of evidence that
someone could look at Freeman footage?

1100
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:57,140
Freeman footage.
I'm convinced that's real Freeman footage.

1101
01:00:57,141 --> 01:00:59,960
What is Freeman footage? Fall
Freeman was, uh, he was, uh,

1102
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,270
the mill creek watershed
up in the Blue Mountains,

1103
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:07,190
northeast Oregon and southeast
Washington. Um, there's this huge area,

1104
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,450
like a lot of municipalities have
their own water districts and they'll,

1105
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,670
they'll own like,
you know,

1106
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,290
tens of thousands of acres of watershed
land and you're not allowed up in there

1107
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:17,690
cause it's a water supply. They don't
want like diesel in it or anything.

1108
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,680
And he was the patrol guy up in there
and he was seeing big foot's find their

1109
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:23,990
tracks and actually seeing
them in the day light up there.

1110
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:28,610
So we started carrying a video camera
and he got footage of that and I'm 100%

1111
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:32,480
convinced that real Brion pull that
shit up. Freeman big foot footage.

1112
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:39,350
This is from the 90s. Yeah.
And then he has another clip
that he wouldn't, he died,

1113
01:01:39,351 --> 01:01:42,710
he got diabetes and died
young but about 15 years ago.

1114
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:47,030
But he has another clip where he
falls down and starts screaming,

1115
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:50,450
kind of cry and it gets bluff charged
for when he gets it real close to the big

1116
01:01:50,451 --> 01:01:51,201
mail comes up at,

1117
01:01:51,201 --> 01:01:54,740
I'm like full guerrilla style charge
and he got footage of it and he never

1118
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:58,460
released it because a, he
looks so bad and it, you know,

1119
01:01:58,461 --> 01:02:01,820
he got pissed his pants or something.

1120
01:02:02,930 --> 01:02:05,420
I just saw something in the woods

1121
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,610
and those tracks are authenticated.

1122
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,800
Do you see much here?
Here?

1123
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,610
I hear the brush popping and stuff.

1124
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,610
Oh, well there you go. But keep watching.

1125
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:54,410
You're up here. Yeah, it's pretty, yeah.

1126
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,250
From watching these videos,
like whenever I think I've, um,

1127
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:01,000
potentially I don't want a big foot.
I never take the camera off.

1128
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,580
I don't know one thing,

1129
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,760
when it costs got up there to
probably drop it on the ground,

1130
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:16,180
it shouldn't be here.

1131
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,340
Does he see it again or is that,
I don't think so.

1132
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,240
What makes you convince it that's real?

1133
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,810
Just like the size of
it and the way it moves.

1134
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:43,350
People went back up there and said it
was well over seven and a half feet tall.

1135
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,740
I dunno where the
comparison video is for it,

1136
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,270
but people did go up there and then right
after that they ended up clear cutting

1137
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:51,751
that whole thing.

1138
01:03:51,751 --> 01:03:55,140
I'm putting like a campground right
there that they're actually staking out.

1139
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:59,190
There's like some ribbons you can see
that flag tie on a couple of the trees and

1140
01:03:59,191 --> 01:04:01,380
it was marked for being
turned into a campground.

1141
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,580
That to me looks way better than the
Wright Patterson or the Roger Roger

1142
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,300
Patterson footage just
because, uh, it's not as clear

1143
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,160
anything about the
Patterson given filaments.

1144
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:20,130
You're seeing the copies you've seen on
TV or like every time they make a clone

1145
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:22,370
copy,
and this is like 30%,

1146
01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:26,070
30% resolution for the Chris
on the original Patterson,

1147
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:28,910
the original footage piece,
which no one knows where it is now.

1148
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:33,360
Probably Al Adley has it is
really clear, clear than the, Oh,

1149
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:35,480
what you see on TV a lot. Like, um,

1150
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,680
nat geo did a good digit
digitization of it and they, um,

1151
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:44,610
they've shown that that's the, that's
like the clearest version you can get now.

1152
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,600
But like the stuff you'd see on TV back
in the day, you, it'd be all blurry.

1153
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,650
It wasn't, the original is not blurry.
Who's this Guy Bob Herana must.

1154
01:04:52,651 --> 01:04:56,420
It says that he was a
Douche bag alcoholic.

1155
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:59,610
I just a liar Gibbons neighbor.
It's like, dude, okay.

1156
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:02,740
You know what the whole
Kennedy assassinations over I,

1157
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:06,720
I'm the one that shot Kennedy.
It was me case closed.

1158
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,480
So he's just some crazy dude is
trying to take, he's not crazy.

1159
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:14,000
He's just an asshole.
She's kind of a day's pretty much pretty.

1160
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:18,370
She move out. It really was a big
foot if it really was a, a video

1161
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,850
of a live Sasquatch and this motherfuckers
running around pretending that he was

1162
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:22,684
a part of a hoax.

1163
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,180
Well, he, he's, there's a, I'm
this guy, if you're into this,

1164
01:05:26,181 --> 01:05:28,500
you can look it up Roger night,
but um,

1165
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,880
I forgot what it's called and he wrote
like a 74 page thing where he interviewed

1166
01:05:31,881 --> 01:05:34,670
Hieronymus it went through and
tore apart his story, all his,

1167
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,300
he's made like five different statements
about how the costume was constructed.

1168
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:43,620
Well, Gimlin said that it was possible
that it was a hoax. He said he was older.

1169
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:46,560
He says, I was totally
convinced no one could fool me.

1170
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:49,470
And of course I'm an older man now
and I think there could have been the

1171
01:05:49,471 --> 01:05:50,850
possibility of a hoax,

1172
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,810
but it would have had to have
been really well planned by Roger.

1173
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:57,640
I told him, he said, he's,
I just, I've talked about,

1174
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,300
I was just with Bob this weekend. He's
the raddest I swear to God did, he's,

1175
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:04,640
he was, uh, he was one of the
first guys are evil Knievel.

1176
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:08,990
He was like a dare devil guy. Like he's
just a raft guide and salt of the earth.

1177
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,120
And we are asking about that. And he
said, the way the questioning was going,

1178
01:06:14,121 --> 01:06:17,500
he was just getting bored, whether
badgered when it, he said, yeah,

1179
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:20,960
there's always a possibility you could be
hugs. And he's like, I know what I saw.

1180
01:06:20,961 --> 01:06:24,470
The thing was, I was looking at it
at eye level for my horse. They,

1181
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:26,680
when they wrote their, there's
B roll footage, you know,

1182
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:30,030
they ride the horse next to the tracks
and the horse prints are not going as

1183
01:06:30,031 --> 01:06:33,590
deep as those footprints.
Really. Yeah. What,

1184
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:37,820
what do you think these fucking
things eat? Everything. Everything.

1185
01:06:37,821 --> 01:06:42,590
A berries. Um, they're omnivores.
They, you know, they're there.

1186
01:06:42,591 --> 01:06:45,680
They'd have obviously have a high
caloric intake to be that big.

1187
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:50,360
And so in the wintertime they
probably eat more meats. Like bill,

1188
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:55,090
they'll hunt deer, elk bear, black
bear. They hunt them. Yeah, they,

1189
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,160
they use tools to the youth.
Sometimes.

1190
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:02,690
We've seen that some evidence where
they've, um, or the elk, the flesh deer,

1191
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,780
elk out of a metal, they'll come running.
It'll take the same routes every time.

1192
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:08,280
And one will be on the,
like one o' rore at one side,

1193
01:07:08,281 --> 01:07:11,960
like hundreds and said they'd been up,
you know, bow hunters creeping up on a,

1194
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,740
on a little herd in the med or something
else and that just God awful roar,

1195
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:20,130
scream, come from one side, they all
run into their side and there was wack,

1196
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:20,531
you know,

1197
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:24,550
and I'm just seeing like where they'll
just take a club and as a deer go run and

1198
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:27,740
by this club in the front legs and shatter
their front legs and then go over and

1199
01:07:27,741 --> 01:07:30,260
break. They'll break their neck when
they kill and they break their neck.

1200
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:33,860
So they kill them with objects.
They used the monetizer,

1201
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:38,150
he's log or something and
you know, I think most of us
use their bare hands then.

1202
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:43,010
Um, they're that big. They would
their bare hands, oh, easy, easy.

1203
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:46,070
They'll pick them up, they'll,
they'll, they'll take a full grown up.

1204
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:49,610
It's looking over their shoulder
and walk off with it. Jesus Christ.

1205
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,550
Like I've heard so many stories like do
not do that electronic bullshit and be

1206
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:55,220
like, you know, just people tell
what they saw and they, you know,

1207
01:07:55,221 --> 01:07:56,600
obviously there's something
that you could go,

1208
01:07:56,601 --> 01:07:57,800
that guy is full of shit or whatever,

1209
01:07:57,801 --> 01:08:00,500
but I'm not like genuine people that
you're talking about just going like,

1210
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:04,730
this guy's not shitting me and you hear
these stories and I've never seen him

1211
01:08:04,731 --> 01:08:08,120
cause I've, I've only seen one really
moving good. And I was at night,

1212
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:10,670
it was on the hickory again,
the hickory Apache reservation.

1213
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:14,620
How many times have you seen big foot?
Probably a half dozen. Half dozen.

1214
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,700
Only time in the daylight.
And I didn't see it.

1215
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:20,600
It was just stand there and I turned, my
head was gone and I didn't see it again.

1216
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,900
That's what I smelled real good.
And then I'm the one at Hickory.

1217
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:27,140
I saw 2004 it came,
walked,

1218
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:30,710
we had all these infrared cameras and
stuff planted the tree line and it walked

1219
01:08:30,711 --> 01:08:34,490
across the South Alpha field and came
into our camp. Everyone was down to fires,

1220
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,660
kind of spread out camp.

1221
01:08:36,010 --> 01:08:38,480
We were at the chief of police
for the WHO's according to,

1222
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,250
for all law enforcement on the Hickory,
Apache,

1223
01:08:40,251 --> 01:08:44,750
Rez and we were on his property and no
one's cute. This deal was a bad ass.

1224
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:48,370
He got in trouble for being
a little too, uh, you know,

1225
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:52,370
he'd beat the shit out of people you like.
Like if he couldn't,

1226
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,600
couldn't prove some guy broken as some
old lady's house, you know, it's a razor.

1227
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:58,640
When those terms, it's going on everyone,
this guy's on math, whatever, you know,

1228
01:08:58,641 --> 01:09:01,790
he's stealing. And if he couldn't prove,
like if he couldn't catch the guy,

1229
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,580
he would just take him outside and beat
the shit out of like one of those guys.

1230
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,470
So no one's coming up.
This guy's ranch,

1231
01:09:06,471 --> 01:09:10,880
he was the very end ranch then it was a
continental divide behind there and it

1232
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:14,580
went from like 25 miles to the
next set of houses. And uh,

1233
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,280
this thing came from the continental
divide side came walking up and I didn't

1234
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:20,110
see it walk up.
I,

1235
01:09:20,110 --> 01:09:24,260
I wasn't aware of it until we had this
guy who was a special forces colonel and

1236
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,390
the special forces. Dr. Guy, not Jamie,

1237
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:30,290
the guy I was with when I saw the one
that I'm beloved night and I thought it

1238
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:33,590
was him dressed all in black and just
weren't because it was below freezing.

1239
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:36,320
We're like 9,000 feet
and I thought it was him.

1240
01:09:36,321 --> 01:09:38,720
I'll bundle it up wearing like a Parker's,
I wasn't sure,

1241
01:09:38,721 --> 01:09:40,130
but it was all black eye.

1242
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,490
I was going to let you doing cause I
could hear fingernails going down the side

1243
01:09:43,491 --> 01:09:47,070
of a tent like it was. She like that
fabric just we'll figure it out.

1244
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:51,260
Isn't that fabric sound nylon and it was
going around the tent and it got over

1245
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:52,760
to the front where the,

1246
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:55,220
it was our bait tent where we're keeping
all the food we were putting out for

1247
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:59,820
bait was that it was, it was new and
then I'm like why? Because it walked.

1248
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:02,030
I get up for a second and show you.
Yeah,

1249
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:05,660
I was watching it for a while and I
had night vision or I had night vision

1250
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:08,540
around my neck and I didn't cause
you don't want to be like the creek,

1251
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:11,180
like get caught staring at someone
through night vision at night, you know.

1252
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,320
So I didn't even look,

1253
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:17,180
I thought it was just a one of
us walk like a man except for it.

1254
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:19,330
Um,
there's walking like a man,

1255
01:10:19,331 --> 01:10:22,070
but it looked like he looked like he
was looking on the ground for something.

1256
01:10:22,071 --> 01:10:25,910
But I think it was was in hindsight
knowing how careful they are about where

1257
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:27,230
they step,
not to step when they leave.

1258
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:29,990
They're real conscious not to leave
tracks like that for the most part.

1259
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:31,011
And it was,

1260
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:33,890
I think it was looking at where it was
stepping so it wouldn't step in and lead

1261
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:34,281
a print,

1262
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:38,570
but it was just walking so it needs to
step in like mud or something like that

1263
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:42,770
to me was walking the walk and
walk like this the whole time.

1264
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:47,320
But they would kneel down like just get
on one knee like that and mess around

1265
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,450
the front of the tent and
they want to go to this tab.

1266
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:52,300
The only girl that was kind of there
was going to hurt Ted going back.

1267
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:54,100
It's hard for people to
hear you when you saw him.

1268
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:59,110
This is going back and forth and I
watched it for about five minutes and the

1269
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:04,100
moon was coming. There was almost a
full, I can't remember exact man. And uh,

1270
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:07,070
it was walking and then the moon
was just about to hit the field.

1271
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,850
It was an old Alfalfa field this
guy had and he would plan it,

1272
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:14,190
but the deer and elk were so thick up
there. He just up and let them eat it.

1273
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:18,540
He just quit farming and there's Alfalfa
ground for like, like a hundred acres.

1274
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:20,700
And so,
uh,

1275
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,070
this thing walked back across the village
as a moon that was coming down and

1276
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:25,020
just walk profiles.
I thought it was the colonel.

1277
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,890
I go back down to camp and I was
going and uh, they were like,

1278
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:30,760
was that you throwing rocks?
Pebbles at us there.

1279
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,330
Pebbles being thrown down by the
guys and they thought it was me.

1280
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:36,090
And like if you're a squashy not
screaming like you don't do like,

1281
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,540
hey that's fool this guy or you just
don't do shit like that if you're out or

1282
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:42,360
you'll get banned, you know, wants
to go out there if you're a squatter.

1283
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:46,340
Is that what you said, the verb or that
I thought you went instead. You were,

1284
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:50,130
I thought you were saying if you were
a squatch like saying here's you throw

1285
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:54,720
rocks at people. Yeah. Yeah. And
so I'll just finish real quick.

1286
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,960
It walked away and I got it back on and
everyone's there had this guy that was

1287
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:01,350
bigger than me go stand. By the time
I went back to my original position,

1288
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:05,670
he was walking around the tents and I
didn't you just something seven foot or

1289
01:12:05,671 --> 01:12:10,230
like six and a half foot. It's not
real clear. Like I didn't, I wasn't,

1290
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:13,830
I hadn't made mental notes.
How exactly did these tents where in a,

1291
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:16,890
someone was walking around how
big they look in scale. So,

1292
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:18,630
but when I saw this guy was about six,

1293
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:21,060
five or so down there
walking around the tent,

1294
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:24,600
he was just warped by this thing
and it wasn't that much taller,

1295
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:28,080
maybe like you know, six, nine,
seven foot. But just the bull.

1296
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:33,081
It was just easily twice the way
to him or more easily at least.

1297
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,140
Where'd this thing go?

1298
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:37,950
It walked back and just walk straight
across the meadow and in the moonlight

1299
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,280
just as it walked past him and that
popped up and started hitting that whole

1300
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:44,970
area and it just went back in the woods.
It, my dad who was a total skeptic,

1301
01:12:44,971 --> 01:12:45,810
he came out there just you know,

1302
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,120
camp for a week and they
have like a father son trip.

1303
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:53,460
He actually heard them
like talking and uh, not,

1304
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,540
not at right then, but then, uh,

1305
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:59,940
the night before that he'd heard them
talking like a couple of them up there and

1306
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:03,930
they were actually Hawkin they do like
to his gym. Ever heard the Sierra sounds?

1307
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:05,790
No,
I got in the car,

1308
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,160
I'll burn you a copy of these guys
got hours of recordings in the Sierra,

1309
01:13:08,210 --> 01:13:11,400
Nevada's of them chattering away and
those things are being translated by

1310
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:14,070
military translators right now.
There's a,

1311
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:15,900
there's a breakthrough on that front too.

1312
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:18,450
There's all kinds of breakthroughs
going down. Right. So this,

1313
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,290
this sound that they make it,

1314
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:24,490
was it anything like with this other guy
was talking about the guy who says he

1315
01:13:24,491 --> 01:13:28,430
shot a baby. He, they were like
mumbling like almost like death. Yay.

1316
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,360
They sound like they were profoundly deaf.

1317
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:36,020
I've heard him do this a few times and
it sounds like to me what it sounded like

1318
01:13:36,241 --> 01:13:40,360
to me it was kind of like maybe like a
monkey trying to talk Chinese something,

1319
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:44,490
something like that. You know that's
funny. Monkey to tongue chain.

1320
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:50,700
Yeah. But like more grumbly though, like
more wall and I've heard the low mumble,

1321
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:54,060
they mumble like, so the idea is that
they have a language or they just,

1322
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:57,580
all the natives and he talked to any
native anywhere will tell you the yeah,

1323
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:00,870
they have language and they can
understand certain words. We say

1324
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:04,500
they can understand.
Certain words were saying,

1325
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:07,620
but we don't have a video of the one
of these things. We don't have to do.

1326
01:14:07,621 --> 01:14:12,010
The Patterson gave one the freemen yeah,
but they could be bullshit. They I, okay.

1327
01:14:12,011 --> 01:14:16,450
Freeman, I'm not so sure,
but I can tell you for, yeah,

1328
01:14:16,451 --> 01:14:18,110
there's been a,
and there's other breaks.

1329
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,110
Who's going down on the
patterns and Gaylen film? What
does it break throughs? Um,

1330
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,810
they've actually found some of the
original trees that were back behind.

1331
01:14:25,811 --> 01:14:29,230
There's been so much regrowth
that these guys, this guy is,

1332
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:31,020
he's the State Park Ranger.

1333
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:34,820
Check the range of cop up there for
Humboldt redwoods, him Robert Letter.

1334
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:38,320
And then another guy, Steve Stroop
hurt the guy owns big foot books, sir.

1335
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:42,370
And Willow Creek has spent two years going
out there and going over the site and

1336
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:45,490
finding an actually found from the
original trees that are obscured.

1337
01:14:45,491 --> 01:14:47,140
You can't see him from the
creek pay more cause it's been,

1338
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:51,430
it's been 43 years or
whatever, 45. And, um,

1339
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:53,770
they're all grown up and uh,

1340
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,510
they've found trees in the background
that one of the original PG fell.

1341
01:14:56,511 --> 01:14:58,900
So we're going to go there and,
and uh,

1342
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,270
with all this like three
d laser scanning stuff,

1343
01:15:01,271 --> 01:15:02,920
they're gonna be able to
get three dimensional,

1344
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:07,180
three dimensional view of
the whole of the whole creek.

1345
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,950
Go back in and plugging the PG films,

1346
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:12,670
like overlay it and they'll get a three
dimensional, like to like a half inch.

1347
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:16,690
How big, how big the subject from the
film is? Well what if it's only five 10,

1348
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:20,020
then what do you do if it's only five 10?

1349
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:26,370
I Dunno, I just don't see that happening.
I don't know. You know, I don't know.

1350
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:29,260
I Trust Bob, you know, cause Bob
Gilman is a really good friend of mine.

1351
01:15:29,261 --> 01:15:31,150
He was himself said,

1352
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:36,010
but you said that he was badgered
and he'll tell you he loved this guy.

1353
01:15:36,011 --> 01:15:38,440
He would love to hang out. And
then I would, I mean I believe him,

1354
01:15:38,441 --> 01:15:42,670
I'm not saying he's full of Shit,
but that there's been a lot says no way.

1355
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,970
He said there's no way.
He said it had to be over 500 pounds.

1356
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,780
And he this guy's expert hunter,
and he's like watching the muscles.

1357
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,860
There's like nine different muscle than
men she can see in the video. Yeah,

1358
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:56,890
but isn't that possible? You just
put some fake mussels on it. Dude.

1359
01:15:56,950 --> 01:16:00,160
The Guy Chambers that made the planet of
the apes back in the 60s when that was

1360
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:04,180
made, said he could not do that. He could
not. He went to his death. That's it.

1361
01:16:04,181 --> 01:16:07,660
Cause there was always a rumor that he
did it and he was just like, nope. Was,

1362
01:16:07,661 --> 01:16:10,480
I'd never did it. He goes, I
wish I could have done that.

1363
01:16:10,481 --> 01:16:14,170
And you're talking about two cowboys.
You'd, Roger was unemployed at the time,

1364
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:18,530
coming up with mate. Roger
did buy a costume from, um,

1365
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,240
his name was Phillip, his name was last
name was Morris out in North Carolina.

1366
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:25,510
He made a gorilla suit and he
did say shitty $400 gorilla suit.

1367
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,300
And it was for recreation's in his,
in his documentary.

1368
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,710
And that's not the suit that he wore
in. So anyways, there's, there's,

1369
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,090
there's controversy around it for sure,

1370
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:35,470
but there's always people looking to like,

1371
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:38,560
I just wish there was some better
shit. Oh, we all do. And you know,

1372
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:40,360
there's some footage it's
going to be coming out.

1373
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,030
The con that's in conjunction
with the DNA study.

1374
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:47,740
It's called the Kentucky footage
and I only seen part of it,

1375
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,670
but people that have seen it say it's,
it's the real deal. There's a face shot.

1376
01:16:51,700 --> 01:16:55,910
How many do you think are alive? If
you had to, if you had to guess, well,

1377
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:59,410
we're going to start getting some hard
evidence on that due to the DNA samples.

1378
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:04,411
But I would say their camp people say
there's got to be at least 2000 just to

1379
01:17:05,201 --> 01:17:06,850
have as many as there
are in North America.

1380
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:09,010
And you're talking Canada
and Canada's big to,

1381
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:14,350
I'd say my guess would be probably
four to 6,000 in North America.

1382
01:17:14,810 --> 01:17:18,100
How the fuck are there four to 6,000
things and no one has a good night. Yeah,

1383
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:20,600
that's what I'm saying. Because
for one thing, did your shit.

1384
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:22,910
You're looking at some giant eight
managers shitting your pants,

1385
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:27,160
people free sort.
Do they make sleep?

1386
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:32,660
They definitely go to Kay's and extreme
weather. Really cold, real hot. Um,

1387
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,750
native state where we live,
they use these. There's,

1388
01:17:35,210 --> 01:17:39,260
there'll be fires in southern Humboldt
and smoke pops out in southern Oregon,

1389
01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:43,110
you know, 150 miles away as the k's are
all connected. Oh really? Yeah, the knee.

1390
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,020
It's the biggest cave
complex in the world. That's,

1391
01:17:45,021 --> 01:17:48,610
but that wouldn't explain everywhere,
but that's pretty bad ass. Yeah.

1392
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,720
You're talking on the Sangamon? Yeah.
Thanks. Okay. I didn't know about that.

1393
01:17:53,721 --> 01:17:54,554
That's interesting.

1394
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:59,060
So they sleep in case they all than it
is telling us that they bury their dead

1395
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:02,330
and caves and we'll like pilot
with rocks just to put big rocks.

1396
01:18:02,331 --> 01:18:05,990
No Man could move in, in places where
machinery is going to go either.

1397
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:08,060
And those cover the cave up.
There's,

1398
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:11,300
we need to find out where the fuck those
caves are and dig them up and find some

1399
01:18:11,301 --> 01:18:11,990
big foot bones.

1400
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:14,660
That's what we were going to do with those
cadaver dogs is because we knew like,

1401
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:19,520
um, if that was the male that
was shot, um, because the,

1402
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,950
the rumor going around
is that was the mom,

1403
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,020
but the DNA shows it was a
male was the father. Hmm.

1404
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:27,920
So maybe it was the grandpa urban grandpa,

1405
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:32,420
whatever old and fucked up stover.
No muscle tone.

1406
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,620
We'll see. We'll see. So anyways, if
we could have got those, I'm sure.

1407
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:38,930
I can't imagine them.
It was as big as you said it was.

1408
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:42,200
I couldn't see them carrying it
more than a mile or two, you know,

1409
01:18:42,201 --> 01:18:44,810
from there and then find it.
And there was cliffs down the backside.

1410
01:18:44,811 --> 01:18:48,230
There was other cave interest is
around who they know that area,

1411
01:18:48,231 --> 01:18:51,020
like no one else.
And who knows where they put it.

1412
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:54,640
But I can't imagine them carrying a
600 pound carcass that far. Right.

1413
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:59,530
But you got to assume too that you
remember that movie grizzly man love it.

1414
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:04,400
Great movie where the Dude, uh,
they, they shot at Grizzly and uh,

1415
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:08,240
when they, uh, came back just a, I
think it was a couple months later,

1416
01:19:08,270 --> 01:19:11,870
there was nothing. Oh, right,
right. Little tiny pieces of bone.

1417
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:15,200
You know what I mean? Even a, a
600 lbs Sasquatch or something.

1418
01:19:15,201 --> 01:19:18,340
If you left the bone behind in the
jungle or in the woods right there,

1419
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:22,580
it's not going to last for long
because this is all the ecosystem.

1420
01:19:22,581 --> 01:19:25,780
A whole cycle setup. Like people say,
well, where's the dead ones? Well,

1421
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:29,330
where's the dead mountain lions? We
know there's mountain lions. Okay.

1422
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:32,780
And Mountain Lions live way closer
to people and civilization. I mean,

1423
01:19:32,781 --> 01:19:35,210
they have like at the edge,
they could kill the mountain.

1424
01:19:35,211 --> 01:19:37,010
Mine in Santa Monica for months ago,

1425
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:40,550
there was a mountain mind siting in
my neighborhood a couple of weeks ago.

1426
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:41,630
There's mountain lions,

1427
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:45,180
they're the tiger that got loose stuff
off the one oh one that's 600 pounds,

1428
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,430
orange tiger run.

1429
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:51,230
It ran loose for three and a half weeks
in a six by two and a half mile stretch

1430
01:19:51,231 --> 01:19:53,830
of, of, you know, up there.
They had helicopters.

1431
01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:56,660
They brought in the six best track.

1432
01:19:56,690 --> 01:20:00,320
They brought in the six best tracking
teams from fish and game with their dogs

1433
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:03,270
in all of California came in, but
it was raining. It was winter.

1434
01:20:03,271 --> 01:20:04,290
I don't often from it was raining,

1435
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:07,710
but they look for that Bangle Tiger
for three weeks right there off the,

1436
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:09,570
off the freeway and you know,

1437
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:13,580
between Malibu and the valley and
couldn't find it until it walked up to

1438
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:13,841
somebody.

1439
01:20:13,841 --> 01:20:18,660
His backyard was staring at her poodle
to what a fucking terrifying look.

1440
01:20:18,661 --> 01:20:22,920
That must have been looking for a giant
Bengal tiger that hasn't eaten in a week

1441
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:27,300
or two weeks or whatever the hell it is.
And it's wandering around.

1442
01:20:27,301 --> 01:20:31,800
So every corner you turn, that might be
it every time you go down a back alley.

1443
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:33,660
That might be it.
Do we just,

1444
01:20:33,690 --> 01:20:36,540
we were just in a tiger preserve
and Sumatra looking for the Orang.

1445
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:40,920
Pendek well that's a, that's a, uh, a
different sort of totally different.

1446
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,810
Totally smaller. Way Smaller.
Yeah. And they're not related.
I don't, well, you know,

1447
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:46,150
we're all related at some point.
Pit.

1448
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:50,100
And is there evidence of this thing
dude there that that is like that's the,

1449
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:54,540
that have all cryptids that's the one
that all scientists agree is did the lady

1450
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:57,350
that runs the UN program down
there for like wow serve it.

1451
01:20:57,370 --> 01:21:00,780
She's seen it three times. Really?
Yeah. And what did she say it is?

1452
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,840
It's some kind of upright
orangutan that walks on two feet.

1453
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:08,140
It's about a meter tall or so, but up to
like 200 like maybe three, 300 feet tall.

1454
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:11,640
200 pounds. Ball of muscle. Whoa. Yeah.

1455
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,850
And so we were up there at night and uh,
that,

1456
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:16,950
that we couldn't like we couldn't
get to the locals about the porters.

1457
01:21:16,951 --> 01:21:20,070
They were scared to death go out cause
those tires, they are their managers.

1458
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,140
They'll eat the tigers. Yeah. Yeah.

1459
01:21:22,141 --> 01:21:25,200
We were out there at night looking
for a ring pin decks and the,

1460
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,170
so you guys went out at
night in the tire preserve.

1461
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:32,310
You did Jesus fucking Christ. What
were you thinking? That's crazy.

1462
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,140
I was thinking it's going
to take money maker.

1463
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,870
Do you think it was going to
get him first? How's hoping,

1464
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:42,170
why is he the slow one Florida day slower
than everybody slow compared to what

1465
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:46,950
tiger man, uh, you know, they said,
I said, well, we're in a big group.

1466
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,620
Like the last guy out here,
like the month before,

1467
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:52,950
whatever they were walking in a group
that went out to a group of 15 people and

1468
01:21:52,951 --> 01:21:54,900
it jumped right in the middle of land.
I got crushed.

1469
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:58,930
His skull ran off to the guy dead.
Well, you know what he did once this,

1470
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:00,930
I do a bit about it.
In my act,

1471
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:05,010
there was a boat and I d I forgot
how many guys were in the boat,

1472
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,420
but this tiger swam out
to the boat three times,

1473
01:22:09,421 --> 01:22:14,040
killed three fucking pizza up before
it, got tired of doing it, swam out,

1474
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:16,590
climbed in the boat, killed a
guy, dragged his bottom shore,

1475
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,770
jumped back in the mortar, swam out
to the boat, killed another guy,

1476
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:23,610
and they're just rolling
like a motherfucker trying
to get away from this thing.

1477
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:27,870
They just get bored. Just one night,
just one day hunt. They hunt those boats.

1478
01:22:27,871 --> 01:22:32,070
I mean those are those legal would
guys and they have those guys get more,

1479
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,820
they get eaten all the time.
They could swim like a motherfucker.

1480
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:38,130
I did not know that they could
swim like that are the aquatic cat.

1481
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:42,060
It's a scary animal man. They're
gnarlier than polar bears. Yeah,

1482
01:22:42,061 --> 01:22:43,830
they're right up there.
Yeah.

1483
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:46,590
The thing about polar bears though
is that did just start eating you.

1484
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,480
They don't kill you first.
A tiger at least has the,

1485
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:53,250
the good grace crush your windpipe
and then take you out quick.

1486
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,350
Polar bears eat you dick first.

1487
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:59,910
They just start chewing on any part
that could hold down just like a salmon.

1488
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:04,500
You were saying something crazy before
that you have to leave salmon out for

1489
01:23:04,501 --> 01:23:06,120
Sasquatch is in some places

1490
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:07,100
they throw rocks at you.

1491
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:10,230
Yeah,
like when you talk to the ne I,

1492
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:13,660
my thing was always go to the tribes and
talking to as many elders as I could.

1493
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:16,410
That would most of it's changed
now more and more. There.

1494
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,330
A lot of dealers that talked to
me now say the kids, they're like,

1495
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:21,310
they're all on a hip hop,
like NBA,

1496
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:24,130
like don't give a shit about any of
the traditions or the storage of that

1497
01:23:24,131 --> 01:23:28,630
knowledge and they just want to be
like it. They want to be Westernized.

1498
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:32,790
Totally. And um, so the, they'll they've
dealt, they said they would never tell.

1499
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:36,370
They were told, never tell white people,
but they'll tell me, cause I'm respectful,

1500
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:39,100
this subject and I'm into
it and I'm listening.

1501
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,910
What you hear is you'll hear all these
things like, well my grandma was around,

1502
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:44,410
they used to do this or
they used to do that.

1503
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:48,970
But the one thing that he's still do up
and down the whole Pacific coast from

1504
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:51,870
California to Alaska is the ne you talked
to any of those net pores when they,

1505
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:54,850
they put the Gillnets cross the
rivers when they pull the nets.

1506
01:23:54,851 --> 01:23:57,730
And if they don't put a
salmon up on the bank,

1507
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,240
on the other bank for the
squatch that it'll come down,

1508
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:03,610
throw rocks at him or pull the
net in and take all the fit.

1509
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,300
Well, what they should do then is
do that and then bring cameras.

1510
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:12,830
Don't leave the May salmon and bring
cameras and boom, you got Sasquatch.

1511
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:16,220
It seems like they, they bait them.
They want them to get this food.

1512
01:24:16,221 --> 01:24:17,880
It's an offering. Right.
But they don't, they don't,

1513
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:20,450
they almost never almost
never see him take it.

1514
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:23,030
They'll only take it when you're not
there. But you know, set up cameras,

1515
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:26,690
set up some cameras, leave a fish. That
seems like the easiest way in the world.

1516
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:29,660
They're Jed eyes mad like they,
it's so crazy.

1517
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:32,750
We don't know if it's the electromagnetic
field around things they pick up on,

1518
01:24:32,751 --> 01:24:33,980
but they are hip to a lot of,

1519
01:24:34,010 --> 01:24:37,340
but they have walked in front of game
cameras before and stuff. So they have,

1520
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:41,750
yeah, we just, there's some
game count photos out there.
Really. The work I work at,

1521
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:45,660
I find those camera photos.
I didn't have one this coming to just say

1522
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:48,840
and when the other day
what I want on my phone.

1523
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:52,910
Yep. Big Flood was one of the
first things that Google pulled up.

1524
01:24:52,911 --> 01:24:57,500
Isn't that funny? Game camera photos. Big
Foot was one of the very first things.

1525
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:02,560
You know why Google and I
was, I'm a retard. I see it.

1526
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:06,530
It says you're a smart guy. Oh, there's
one that's totally fake as fuck. Well,

1527
01:25:06,531 --> 01:25:10,040
most of them are. We just saw, I don't
think this one is on the Internet yet.

1528
01:25:10,041 --> 01:25:13,870
This guy, oh, this one's tripping. This
one looks like a monkey. That's like a,

1529
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:14,773
like a four.

1530
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,090
Okay.

1531
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:19,980
Like something on four legs
that's fake. It's fake. Yeah. No,

1532
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,050
that they have to walk on two legs or
they're not real. They're not legitimate.

1533
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:25,490
They go on for sometimes for sure.
They'll knock a walk.

1534
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:29,330
Especially the young ones. Yeah.
Some of these like really fake God.

1535
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:30,890
Yeah.

1536
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:33,980
Which ones do you, how do you
discern whether they're fake or real?

1537
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:35,283
MMM.

1538
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:39,390
God, I wish I could get ahold of cliff
and have him send you one right now.

1539
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:42,530
A lot of the best ones do.
People don't. You'd be surprised.

1540
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:45,180
Most people aren't looking for
fame and fortune, like with this,

1541
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:48,630
the most of the stuff that gets
caught of the, we're going,

1542
01:25:48,631 --> 01:25:50,550
we went to the Mongolian room.
Do you know, you talk about,

1543
01:25:50,570 --> 01:25:51,990
you know the Pacific northwest,

1544
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:57,710
the fifth largest pine forest in North
America is in Arizona. Really? Yeah.

1545
01:25:57,740 --> 01:25:59,390
The Mongolian rim.
That's where this is.

1546
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:00,390
Okay.

1547
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:01,770
Well this might have even
been the video we did.

1548
01:26:01,860 --> 01:26:03,690
No.
What,

1549
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,850
what are you slowing down to? Quarter
speed. What is this? I won't say Shit.

1550
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:12,110
It's hard when we take something
from Youtube, um, put her, I I,

1551
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:15,380
I'm not even sure that all the footage,

1552
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:18,920
that's what big foot and none of it's
in like the HD or anything like that.

1553
01:26:18,921 --> 01:26:23,180
It's always like this, you
know, we're really low quality.

1554
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,850
How convenient. You know, it's funny dude,

1555
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:30,350
is that the best DNA sample from
Asia came from destination truth,

1556
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,680
you know that TV show destination truth.
Yeah. It's kind of Hokey. Whatever.

1557
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:38,930
They just aired it I think the Vietnam
episode and we're going to work,

1558
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:43,990
our team's going to go there because
the thing ran past the camera man at the

1559
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:46,100
base camp ran right by him on the side,

1560
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:51,101
like a big eight footer and they got four
good footprint cast cause it's stepped

1561
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:55,550
in mud a couple of spots. And
Really? Yeah, they got d, that's the,

1562
01:26:55,551 --> 01:26:58,630
this is destination truth.
Yeah, the Vietnam side,

1563
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,490
I think it just aired last night or the
night before or something. I don't know.

1564
01:27:01,491 --> 01:27:05,090
I was on, I was up in the mountains
so I wasn't, and it's a big foot.

1565
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:08,960
It's a Vietnamese when they call
them rock ape. So The v the non,

1566
01:27:08,961 --> 01:27:10,070
that's called them rock caves.

1567
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:14,090
Because you're worried about
that Vietnamese big foot. No,

1568
01:27:14,091 --> 01:27:16,790
I've never heard a rock.
So did you talk to him and Brock came,

1569
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:18,890
talked to a whole alert
guys or any of those?

1570
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:23,600
All the non like the Ford Ranger guys and
the, you know, behind the enemy lines.

1571
01:27:23,601 --> 01:27:27,590
Got even even guys, just regular army
guys, when they're up in the northeast,

1572
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:28,880
like in the [inaudible] territory,

1573
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:31,880
they the rocks and throw apes out
and they call them rock caves.

1574
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,140
They throw rocks at him.

1575
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:37,970
They found several footprints and they
also caught something on thermal imaging

1576
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:43,250
that um, might have been a bipedal
creature. It says, however, in the end,

1577
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:48,200
Gates couldn't be sure that they
found evidence of a Bot. Toot, toot.

1578
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:52,800
Some of they say it. That's
not, but to toot, which led, uh,

1579
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:55,930
some viewers to vent their
frustrations on Twitter. Well,

1580
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:58,760
people vent their frustrations on
Twitter and I'm minute of what you'd do.

1581
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:02,780
I only want to read Twitter after all the
what ifs that we've thrown in today on

1582
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:07,410
the big foot front. Just for the
smart people. They can't Miss Kate.

1583
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:12,140
I don't have a smart filter. I need a
smart filter for Twitter. Uh, Nah, he,

1584
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:17,120
the idiots are very, they
should have their say to
homes was not constant. Right.

1585
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,510
I honestly don't, I don't read
any reviews. I don't read,

1586
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:24,500
I don't read anything. I don't look
at any of those big foot websites.

1587
01:28:24,501 --> 01:28:27,400
I don't really, how come?
It's just, you know,

1588
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:31,640
it's like you must get tired of people
saying that you crazy big foot's fake.

1589
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:35,990
Cause like I said that I was going to
talk to you about this today because uh,

1590
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:39,230
all my life, like I said, I've,
I've read so many books on big foot,

1591
01:28:39,231 --> 01:28:41,820
I've watched so many documentaries
are always been fascinated by it.

1592
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:47,090
Immediately people were like,
who can big foods? Food, food,

1593
01:28:47,091 --> 01:28:51,500
can big foods foods? Like, no you
don't. No big foot's fake. He just,

1594
01:28:51,501 --> 01:28:55,320
I used to Dick, you want everything
to be negative, you fuck right.

1595
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:57,470
And there was a lot of, well you
know, it's like when people say,

1596
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:59,760
well I think that this is my third.
It's like,

1597
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:02,100
like I've said to this thing for like,
you know,

1598
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,120
over 30 years and have spent 25
years looking in the field actively.

1599
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:10,170
And I mean I know that real, I've
seen it for myself, I've heard him,

1600
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,660
I've talked to thousands of people
that have seen him that are legitimate.

1601
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:16,440
I mean I've seen him myself,
I know the real so that when people go,

1602
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,420
well I think this last time hap right.

1603
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:20,310
And they just thought of it
in five minutes and it's like,

1604
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:22,620
well that's like me going to some like,
you know,

1605
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:27,700
astrophysicist guy in a lab with
a giant telescope looking up at,

1606
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,750
you know, 30 foot telescope looking
at the stars and studying, you know,

1607
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:35,610
he's got a phd in astronomy and I go,
I think the moon's made a cheese.

1608
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:38,850
That's what I think that's like when
people come to me until they think about

1609
01:29:38,851 --> 01:29:41,400
big foot in or what the fuck
they're talking about. Yeah.

1610
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:43,170
It's one of those things, man. It's a,

1611
01:29:43,171 --> 01:29:47,430
it's one of those things where I would
imagine it would get really annoying if

1612
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:48,930
that was your life's dedication.

1613
01:29:48,931 --> 01:29:51,780
Like I can say I believe in big foot and
people call me an idiot and I'm like,

1614
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,990
whatever.
I'm freely factor.

1615
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:58,620
I'm the fucking standup comedian,
you know? There's a lot of evidence.

1616
01:29:58,621 --> 01:29:59,680
I'm probably in it.

1617
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:04,440
The pig foot thing is just one little
piece of the puzzle that shows your smart

1618
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:09,420
though. Really? I leave everything open.
You know? I leave open the possibility.

1619
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:12,090
There's a, there's a lot of things that
I leave out, but probably ridiculous,

1620
01:30:12,091 --> 01:30:14,820
but that's,
to me then that one makes sense.

1621
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:18,480
There's just too many people that have
seen something. If one of them is true,

1622
01:30:18,481 --> 01:30:19,260
it's real.

1623
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:24,260
There's too many different names for
it and native American languages.

1624
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:29,721
I believe there's more than 105
508 categorize for North America.

1625
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,740
Yeah.
What's that?

1626
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:35,040
There's not that many things that they
believed that aren't real. You know,

1627
01:30:35,041 --> 01:30:39,420
they have like they know,
they pray to certain gods that the,

1628
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:42,840
you know like the rain gods and
fire gods and all that kind of shit,

1629
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:45,360
but they don't have like
things that aren't real.

1630
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:49,980
They don't have too many like or their
spirit animals and bigfoots in both

1631
01:30:49,981 --> 01:30:51,510
worlds. Big. That's the one at walls.

1632
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:56,150
Some have like they think it's a real
animal in both worlds, but yeah, it's,

1633
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,630
they're not dude. No native will
tell you there are animal there.

1634
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:03,690
There are type of people.
So they think it's just a tribe.

1635
01:31:03,990 --> 01:31:06,920
A tribe. Wow. They think of it as
a tribe. Oh yeah. You know what?

1636
01:31:07,050 --> 01:31:08,880
We were just in Australia
with the aboriginals.

1637
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:13,910
Those guys blew my mind and they have
so much knowledge about these things.

1638
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:16,470
Like they live,
they have them in Australia.

1639
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:20,320
How the fuck did they get to Australia?
We got our folks,

1640
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:22,690
we'll talk about Trillia.
They're not sure they were,

1641
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:26,070
the aboriginals all say they were there
when they got their 50,000 years ago.

1642
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:28,950
So the big foots are
good at avoiding people.

1643
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:33,630
On every content is not like one group
of big foot's. That's a retard race.

1644
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:38,480
They see him in the summer
way North or the, uh,

1645
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:42,510
where it's daylight all day long.
Like way in northern Canada and stuff.

1646
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:46,110
They'll see him like small, like
outpost villages, like native villages.

1647
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:48,960
They'll come in because they'll go to the
garbage dumps in the middle of the day

1648
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:52,850
and it's like, why don't you guys fill
them? They just, they just don't. What,

1649
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:54,450
why would they just not,

1650
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:58,800
that doesn't make any sense in 2012
that you would see a kid's a kid.

1651
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,300
There's a lot of kids now
because of our show too.

1652
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:04,270
Like more kids are in it and like,
they're like, oh, you're like, hey,

1653
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:06,430
we're gonna try to film it.
But these people just don't,

1654
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:09,530
what do you mean they just don't, that's
cool. That's crazy. How could you,

1655
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,940
it's just his head.
What's that? Is it crazy?

1656
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,480
Have you guys spent any time on big it
is Brian. No, I don't think it's crazy.

1657
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:19,720
What do you think they, you know, they're
busy looking for this thing, hunting it.

1658
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:23,090
They don't carry a camera around for that.
One second though.

1659
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,870
These people aren't looking for
big. These people live there. Brian,

1660
01:32:25,871 --> 01:32:30,850
are you playing devil's advocate here?
What he does is killing me.

1661
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:33,970
I just can't believe that that
that one person doesn't have,

1662
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:38,320
like when those go cams on and it's HD
go camps that cost $89 or something like

1663
01:32:38,321 --> 01:32:42,010
that. That has fucking crazy.
If it happens, it's going to,

1664
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:45,550
technology is catching up to
the squatch for sure. Yeah.

1665
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:49,090
That's going to be the drone
to catch them. I Dunno dude.

1666
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:51,480
So do you believe that they're all over
the country and you believe there are?

1667
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:54,520
No, I've, I've, I've
personally heard them.

1668
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:59,440
I personally heard them and Oregon,
Washington, California, Alaska,

1669
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:04,750
Florida, Kentucky, Florida.
Yeah, the skunk ape.

1670
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,900
Really.
And it's not a Cuban

1671
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:13,600
dare you get over here.
Well the, they, they have,

1672
01:33:13,601 --> 01:33:16,620
I've started seeing a mountain
lions in Florida Jam. Oh,

1673
01:33:16,621 --> 01:33:19,600
he's just another reason like government
doesn't want to acknowledge big foot is,

1674
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:22,800
there's a few reasons governors,
Wanda, but everywhere we go,

1675
01:33:22,801 --> 01:33:24,030
we go to these places.
Like they say,

1676
01:33:24,031 --> 01:33:26,040
there's no mountain lions here
but they're here. You know,

1677
01:33:26,041 --> 01:33:29,190
you keep hearing that until one gets hit
by it or someone would get shoots. Wine.

1678
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:31,200
Well one got shot one
recently in the Ottawa.

1679
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:35,190
They thought they'd been extinct in
Canada or in that part of Canada for more

1680
01:33:35,191 --> 01:33:40,191
than since the 18 hundreds those last a
citing that they had and they shot a big

1681
01:33:40,651 --> 01:33:44,610
one. Man, they're spread out. They don't
want to do a shot one in Connecticut,

1682
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,550
but the, you have to have a
management pilot and it costs.

1683
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:50,370
Millions of these states are all strapped.
You had to have a management plan.

1684
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:52,380
They don't want to acknowledge it.
That's what I said.

1685
01:33:52,381 --> 01:33:54,060
We don't have them because they
don't want to have to deal with them,

1686
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,260
but with big foot,

1687
01:33:55,261 --> 01:33:59,430
I think it was more just what's really
the biggest thing when it comes out.

1688
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:03,660
They're real here soon is to be the
whole like I think there should be like a

1689
01:34:03,661 --> 01:34:07,530
lot of PhD students write papers
on this and like psychiatrists and

1690
01:34:07,531 --> 01:34:11,310
psychologists are going to write
books on this and on how these things,

1691
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:15,300
there's all this evidence and stories
and just everything right there in front

1692
01:34:15,301 --> 01:34:17,850
of you and people refuse
to acknowledge it. Well,

1693
01:34:17,851 --> 01:34:20,610
I think one of the reasons why they
refuse to acknowledge is what we've talked

1694
01:34:20,611 --> 01:34:22,530
about before.
There's so many people that fake it.

1695
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:24,930
There's so many people
that fake UFO stories.

1696
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,880
There's so many people
that fake bigfoot stores.

1697
01:34:27,180 --> 01:34:31,440
People are fucking crazy and there's a
lot of people out there. Big Foot storage.

1698
01:34:31,441 --> 01:34:35,430
Well you don't think so. I think
anything cryptic man, I think loch ness,

1699
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:39,330
anything UFO, anything
big foot. I think ghosts,

1700
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,520
there's a lot of people that are
full of shit when it comes to those,

1701
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:45,600
those stories because those are like
fun stories to bring up. You know?

1702
01:34:45,601 --> 01:34:49,140
Like if people say they saw a crocodile,
a generally genuinely believed them.

1703
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:54,030
When you start saying you saw some shit
that's, that's in the cryptic realm, man,

1704
01:34:54,031 --> 01:34:54,960
you might've seen it,

1705
01:34:54,961 --> 01:34:58,160
but it also might be that you're one of
those crazy that likes to pretend you

1706
01:34:58,161 --> 01:35:00,970
saw something awesome.
You talk those people long enough,

1707
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:02,730
it comes apparent that's what's going on.
See,

1708
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:05,840
I wish I was on your show then because
I'm way better at that than most people.

1709
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:09,680
I'm really good at sniffing out bullshit.
We're really good.

1710
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:12,060
We're getting ready to jump the
shark here. Probably pretty soon.

1711
01:35:12,061 --> 01:35:14,180
It cause we're run out of the videos of
the cat and they're talking about having

1712
01:35:14,181 --> 01:35:17,260
celebrities. Come on dude, I'll
come on. We got to, come on now.

1713
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:19,880
Come on and just let me come on
in and screen your guests. I go,

1714
01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:22,800
this guy's gotta be, that'd be honest.
This guy's full of shit. This guy's car.

1715
01:35:22,801 --> 01:35:25,490
They'd be screaming at me like,
dude, you're not telling the truth.

1716
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,490
I know when people are telling the
truth, I smell them. It's weird.

1717
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:30,650
I've always been good
at no one crazy people.

1718
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:33,470
So if you bring me in front of a crazy
dude and he tells you a big foot story,

1719
01:35:33,471 --> 01:35:35,480
I'm going to tell him he's full
of Shit. Well, yeah, so I mean,

1720
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:37,180
I don't believe everything I
hear people go, you guys live.

1721
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:38,510
Are they gonna hear on
there? It's like, well,

1722
01:35:38,580 --> 01:35:40,940
you see witnesses we're dealing with,
they've already been vetted.

1723
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:46,040
One show where there was this one
obviously gay guy whose like nick.

1724
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:50,790
Yeah. Whose job it was right here.
The big files. Right. I'm like, bitch,

1725
01:35:50,791 --> 01:35:52,430
she ain't seen no, no, no. That guy,

1726
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:55,820
he just tried to drag some dudes in the
woods and hope somebody stumbles on your

1727
01:35:55,821 --> 01:36:00,300
Dick. That guy was a wildlife biologist.
Is he good for him? He's full of shit too.

1728
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:04,330
No,
I totally believe that.

1729
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:07,730
It seemed like he was making it
up as he went along to me. Now.

1730
01:36:07,780 --> 01:36:10,830
He was a great dude. He
was great. Yeah. Yeah.

1731
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,270
He firmly believe that that guy
saw a big foot. Yeah. We spent,

1732
01:36:14,990 --> 01:36:18,560
he was his camera, this son of a bitch.
We were with that guy for a week,

1733
01:36:18,561 --> 01:36:23,561
like he was our local guide and
he showed us around and he was,

1734
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:27,270
he was fun. You'd love that
guy. He's hilarious. But um,

1735
01:36:27,670 --> 01:36:28,760
as he was our guide for a week,

1736
01:36:28,761 --> 01:36:32,060
so we were with the guy for a week and
Matt knew the guy for several years

1737
01:36:32,061 --> 01:36:32,491
already.

1738
01:36:32,491 --> 01:36:36,230
He's been on different expeditions around
the country with them and he never,

1739
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:39,080
he's, and usually when people
start telling those stories,

1740
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:43,460
like more will come up and it changes.

1741
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:47,190
His story is just the same all the
way through it. Sally wrote Italian,

1742
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:51,440
he's smart. It's good job, dude.
Well, I'm not saying, I don't know.

1743
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:53,870
He might actually be the one guy
that's telling the truth. Right.

1744
01:36:54,050 --> 01:36:56,180
The one guy that we're all sure is lying.

1745
01:36:56,240 --> 01:36:58,460
We'll see if you think
he is to this season.

1746
01:36:58,461 --> 01:37:01,080
I'm sure I'll think he's lying
if he think he's lying. I should.

1747
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:04,160
I think almost everybody's
aligned. Yeah. Most people.

1748
01:37:04,290 --> 01:37:06,950
I think if you lived out in the woods
and he lived in a rural community,

1749
01:37:06,951 --> 01:37:07,220
where there,

1750
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:10,030
where there are big foot's around you
and you've talked to so many people that

1751
01:37:10,040 --> 01:37:12,260
like, dude, dude, I like big foot so much.

1752
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:17,260
I thought of getting a buying land in
the Pacific northwest just to live in the

1753
01:37:17,511 --> 01:37:21,980
summers with hope of seeing a big
dude. I dude, I get stupid. I am.

1754
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:25,580
I know the place. It's for sale
right now. Really? Where is it?

1755
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:30,470
You sound real estate now? No, no, no,
no citing spots. That'd be a good move,

1756
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:32,480
Dude. I'm talking to the guy
about trying to buy it, right?

1757
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:35,060
If you went and you bought real estate,
heavy,

1758
01:37:35,061 --> 01:37:38,930
big foot areas and set up a set plan,
cameras and shit, that's the plan.

1759
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:39,770
I have a lodge.

1760
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:42,950
If you live like somewhere in the
Pacific northwest and in an area,

1761
01:37:42,951 --> 01:37:46,820
there's a heavy duty bigfoot sightings.
She's fucking set up cameras everywhere,

1762
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:50,780
everywhere, and every day you go and
check those cameras. I said, well that's,

1763
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,390
that's what the Olympic project there's
going on right now. They actually,

1764
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:54,980
one of the,
one of the best pieces,

1765
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:58,140
DNA from the Olympic project
is this weird looking bigfoot.

1766
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:02,010
They've got pictures of it comes up
and sniff the camera and licked it.

1767
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:05,940
And they got saliva off the
camera. Olympic project. Yeah.

1768
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:08,820
Did they have these photos online? Can
you see the photos of him? I think so.

1769
01:38:09,240 --> 01:38:10,330
So where did they take the,

1770
01:38:10,860 --> 01:38:15,420
like they shipped it next day and
brought it to a site that we have. We,

1771
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,860
we uh,
we,

1772
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:18,970
there's a lot of,

1773
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:22,000
there's a lot of cops involved in this
and we have like protocol we follow for

1774
01:38:22,001 --> 01:38:25,690
collecting DNA evidence. Cause you
guys laugh about this. I used to,

1775
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:28,070
I was on this crazy squatch adventure,

1776
01:38:28,090 --> 01:38:32,350
like pride 2000 to 2001,
2002.

1777
01:38:32,920 --> 01:38:33,580
And this thing,

1778
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:36,310
this guy bought property had been
abandoned for 11 years and the squashes,

1779
01:38:36,311 --> 01:38:39,790
we're living on the property and they
didn't like him moving and all this stuff

1780
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:43,790
happened, but they, um,
they, uh, they were,

1781
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:47,260
we'd finally these huge scats in the
woods or on the property. They, China,

1782
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:51,190
like giant human shits,
like that'd be like a foot high.

1783
01:38:51,191 --> 01:38:54,730
And 18 inches across at the base,
like big thick, like two inch cables.

1784
01:38:55,180 --> 01:38:57,520
And I'd collect them and bring them
down with a fishing game and drop off.

1785
01:38:57,530 --> 01:39:02,200
Like check out this big foot. You know,
Scott, can you guys DNA test it? You know,

1786
01:39:02,201 --> 01:39:03,220
what can you do?
Blah Blah Blah.

1787
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:06,680
And then my buddy got a job at the fish
and game like a couple of years later,

1788
01:39:06,681 --> 01:39:09,070
I'm all do whatever happened.
If I'd sabals he's like,

1789
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:10,211
we were talking about about you.

1790
01:39:10,211 --> 01:39:13,030
I brought all these big foot scat samples
and I brought in some hair a couple

1791
01:39:13,050 --> 01:39:15,960
times and it's not, he's like,
do they talk about some crazy guy

1792
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:19,540
brings it bear shit, drops
it off. They throw it away.

1793
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:22,520
They never even looked at it. They
wouldn't even look at it. Yeah,

1794
01:39:22,521 --> 01:39:25,880
they're probably like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well we're going to check on it. For you.

1795
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:30,350
It was like that. Very unprofessional.
And then you pay for something.

1796
01:39:30,351 --> 01:39:32,950
You think that they have to give
you some kind of real results.

1797
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:37,270
They should really be checking fuckers.
Tax Dollars.

1798
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:42,230
Glue hair on his chest is big
but episode or he's a savage.

1799
01:39:42,231 --> 01:39:45,710
You're a very good catcher.
Brian's an animal. Um, it,

1800
01:39:45,711 --> 01:39:48,570
so the Olympic project says they have a,

1801
01:39:48,571 --> 01:39:52,180
the researches in the Olympic mountain
range in Washington state. Uh,

1802
01:39:52,350 --> 01:39:56,210
the Olympic project is a comprehensive
systematic camera trap program consisting

1803
01:39:56,211 --> 01:40:01,130
of 50 plus cameras placed along predatory
travel routes through the Olympic

1804
01:40:01,130 --> 01:40:01,131
mountains.

1805
01:40:01,131 --> 01:40:04,370
Our primary focus is to obtain a
series of crystal clear photographs of

1806
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:06,800
Sasquatch in their natural environment.
So,

1807
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:10,470
so far it says they haven't gotten
anything. Is that what it says? Yeah,

1808
01:40:10,471 --> 01:40:12,890
they have footprints. They
don't have any, none others.

1809
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:15,500
They see everyone had to sign

1810
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:19,410
DA's about the DNA.
So that could be why that's not on there.

1811
01:40:19,411 --> 01:40:21,430
But I s I would see the photos.
You didn't like I looked at,

1812
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,850
I thought it was a sock puppet
when I first looked at it,

1813
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:26,760
but the DNA came back with jet.

1814
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:31,970
Yeah. This isn't saying here that they
have anything. It doesn't, no. Doesn't,

1815
01:40:31,971 --> 01:40:33,810
not on their website, dude. I'll call,

1816
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:37,190
I'll call the Guy Derek that bears
and deers. It's cool looking.

1817
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,750
They've won all the game camp photos.

1818
01:40:40,550 --> 01:40:45,270
There's those big contests every like
5001st place. They have one bad ass man.

1819
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:48,960
They've got some awesome photos.
They do have a lot of great wildlife.

1820
01:40:49,090 --> 01:40:52,020
The mountain lion stocking the duck
and the duck doesn't see it. Yeah,

1821
01:40:52,021 --> 01:40:55,630
they weren't first prize last year
with that one. It's really cool, man.

1822
01:40:55,631 --> 01:41:00,550
They show this mountain lion walking
through the snow to and they a bunch of

1823
01:41:00,551 --> 01:41:04,330
bears, including bear standing
upright, which is pretty fucking cool.

1824
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:08,380
Bears getting really close to
the trap coyotes. Elk. Wow.

1825
01:41:08,410 --> 01:41:12,160
I mean their camera chat photos make me
want to buy some land and set up camera

1826
01:41:12,161 --> 01:41:15,370
traps. That'd be bad ass just
to see different shit every day.

1827
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:19,160
You know huge elk. Yeah,
I'll do that. Yeah.

1828
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:23,080
A mountain lion got right up to
the camera. Oh Shit. They look,

1829
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:25,720
they'd notice it like animals.
If you look at most of the pictures,

1830
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:28,660
they'll be looking at the camera.
At least on the second shot.

1831
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:31,450
They'll that infrared flash
goes up. They look. Yeah,

1832
01:41:31,451 --> 01:41:34,870
and there's been a lot of cameras
through the squatters. We'll break them.

1833
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,030
They'll turn flip around backwards.

1834
01:41:37,031 --> 01:41:40,900
I put a camera traps from are they walked
into a camp when I was in and I had

1835
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:41,240
the camera.

1836
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:45,530
The camera's all hidden like in tall grass
and stuff and they're all pushed down.

1837
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:49,450
All of them were pushed down so that
the lens was facing the ground. Wow.

1838
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:52,210
These folks usually just check it out.

1839
01:41:52,211 --> 01:41:57,211
Just go to the Olympic project.com just
to look at the actual real animals,

1840
01:41:57,281 --> 01:42:01,530
the bobcats and the wildlife. No fucking
big foot though. They got, they got a fee.

1841
01:42:01,570 --> 01:42:04,870
They got a photo of elk.
Fucking awesome elks.

1842
01:42:04,871 --> 01:42:08,220
Paused right in front of the
camera and fuck. This is amazing.

1843
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:13,180
Can you put it back up on that one? I
can see. Yeah, put up an Olympic project.

1844
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:19,090
This is a myth. The, the photos are
amazing man, but no big foot man.

1845
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:23,800
They've got another camera. There's
a two shot. There's two shots of, uh,

1846
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:27,370
of a squatch coming up to the camera real
close. But it must not be on the way.

1847
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:29,920
You don't. I'll call Derrick
when we're done. And this one,

1848
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:33,460
it says bear gets close to the camera.
They don't, I don't see shit up here.

1849
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:37,030
That's a, that says that
even says it's too big foot.

1850
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:41,890
I don't think it's up there just
because of the NDA. Look, there it is.

1851
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:45,070
That's it. Yeah. Scroll down
to photos are awesome man.

1852
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:48,670
It's really cool that they're saying
that Sasquatch right there. What?

1853
01:42:48,671 --> 01:42:52,300
That mountain lion looking fat down.
The next one down. That's the squatch.

1854
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,780
Oh wait, where's the one where you can
see it's whole arm and eyeball and stuff.

1855
01:42:55,781 --> 01:43:00,730
The creature reappears so it go
back up there. That one? Yeah.

1856
01:43:00,731 --> 01:43:04,540
Okay. They've done all this analization
on that and that hair pattern,

1857
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:09,570
the and patterns of that and the tha tha
tha that's like seven that things like

1858
01:43:10,571 --> 01:43:15,190
seven feet off the ground. So it can be
a bear. Bears don't get over six, six,

1859
01:43:15,191 --> 01:43:19,660
six would be the top like a trophy
bear kind of bear black bears.

1860
01:43:19,661 --> 01:43:22,780
There's only black only black
pants, like a producer guy. Uh,

1861
01:43:22,781 --> 01:43:26,800
six six is like about as big
as a blackberry. Good. Six
foot, huge for black pair.

1862
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:28,271
Brian,
which uh,

1863
01:43:28,271 --> 01:43:33,271
which page did you
look@andthebigproject.com
possible squat sightings possible

1864
01:43:34,061 --> 01:43:36,100
squatch side.
Is it on the menu?

1865
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:40,030
But did you guys patent the word
squatch cause I had never heard it.

1866
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:45,250
Is that you? Did you come up
with it? Um, I know Scott Harris.

1867
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:49,870
You never know that guy. A comedian
he has got, what's his name? Harriet?

1868
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,000
No,
he wasn't like big timer thing.

1869
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,040
But I know he did a
documentary called squatch in,

1870
01:43:55,041 --> 01:43:59,530
but I never heard anyone say it before.
I've said it was rainy.

1871
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:03,800
Licky man, this is a what?
I was the first one. Shit.

1872
01:44:04,460 --> 01:44:06,950
Yeah. Well can't see shit. I agree.

1873
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:11,310
I've not too impressed when they sons
of bitches but do that. But again,

1874
01:44:11,340 --> 01:44:14,340
animal experts have looked at it and the
hair does it match and then how could

1875
01:44:14,341 --> 01:44:15,860
you tell me you can't
tell him like an animal,

1876
01:44:15,890 --> 01:44:18,230
etc. A PETCO and this is the problem.

1877
01:44:18,231 --> 01:44:23,231
The problem is the best fuck that their
best shit is blurry as fuck because it's

1878
01:44:23,331 --> 01:44:27,410
set there. The camera's set to take
pictures like 30 feet away. Not a foot,

1879
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:30,690
but they're pro their photo
galleries. Amazing man. Yeah.

1880
01:44:30,830 --> 01:44:34,570
I don't care if it's set to take 33
this is, it should be a photo of man.

1881
01:44:34,571 --> 01:44:38,320
It should be a photo wanting to fuck
up thing. One comment. I hope so man.

1882
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,960
Frustrated dude. It's really fresh. What
if they found out that it wasn't real?

1883
01:44:41,961 --> 01:44:45,550
What did you find out? You
already stooped. See that
there's no way you got duped.

1884
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:47,090
There's no,
I'm not worried about that.

1885
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:50,300
So what you saw was so
conclusive that you're 100% sure.

1886
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,890
Why didn't you have a camera?
One of those 12 times? I did do,

1887
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:56,750
but it was the only one I saw on
that day that I didn't cause my,

1888
01:44:56,870 --> 01:44:57,980
my shit got ripped off.

1889
01:44:57,981 --> 01:45:02,420
Like when synclavier and you leave your
truck that will not put psychically knew

1890
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:05,620
that your camera wasn't present.
Imagine if there is so sensitive.

1891
01:45:05,621 --> 01:45:07,990
I would have had a camera when I got a
picture. Do you think so? I wouldn't have.

1892
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:11,390
It was, it was less. I slept for
like literally like half a second.

1893
01:45:11,391 --> 01:45:14,660
It was just gone.
Once Google goggles comes out,

1894
01:45:14,661 --> 01:45:16,310
people need to go hiking for Sasquatch.

1895
01:45:16,311 --> 01:45:19,920
People aren't goggle cause there's
people wearing those now that those the a

1896
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:22,610
little GoPros. Yeah, we'll
not have a smaller ones.

1897
01:45:22,611 --> 01:45:26,190
We were like little spy ones but does
one suck the rate resolution set to the

1898
01:45:26,191 --> 01:45:29,090
goat razor HD. So it's like
people are using coke brothers.

1899
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:32,030
People are mountain among the helmets
they have to someone. This is,

1900
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,760
it's going to get ridiculous. So
there's a new, there's a new footage.

1901
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:37,820
We take it as real of a squashed down
on the side of the road that some

1902
01:45:37,821 --> 01:45:40,810
hillbillies. God with
a Gopro. Really? Yeah.

1903
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:44,000
The new footage maybe if you look up from
like two or three weeks ago it sat on

1904
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:46,400
the side of the road. It's on the
right. It's up in Canada somewhere.

1905
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:50,320
New Big foot footage. What would you
look up on? Youtube. Canadian. Bigfoot.

1906
01:45:50,530 --> 01:45:54,470
Maybe go pro. A lot of sightings
come from Katie. Can I Canadia

1907
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:59,780
and like crazy. It was just
crazy. People reporting them.

1908
01:45:59,810 --> 01:46:03,890
There'd be just as many settings
in Hawaii. Right? Right. Or road.

1909
01:46:03,900 --> 01:46:05,480
I will not really,

1910
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:10,630
because if there wasn't a
place for them in 1900 or 1850,

1911
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:14,630
everyone knew what a Unicorn was
and no one knew what a big foot was.

1912
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:18,530
But you can find hundreds and hundreds
of newspaper clippings about people

1913
01:46:18,531 --> 01:46:22,730
seeing a giant ape. There's no people
saying they saw a unicorn. Right?

1914
01:46:24,140 --> 01:46:27,620
Yeah, yeah. It's always the
same thing. Right? Yeah.

1915
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,620
And it follows the same pattern is
like we were when we were in Australia,

1916
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:33,750
like we, we'd always heard that
you always were different than um,

1917
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:36,350
that's what they call me. The
aboriginals and the struck home galleys,

1918
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,440
we'd always heard galleys were different
than big foot's. When we're down there,

1919
01:46:39,441 --> 01:46:42,650
we found out there tear Bigfoot's man.
I mean that the way they act,

1920
01:46:43,070 --> 01:46:47,450
we hurt the best stuff or recorded was
in Australia you think the exactly the

1921
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:50,110
same. I don't know about
that, but the, the,

1922
01:46:50,110 --> 01:46:52,530
the action, the patterns,
all that was the same.

1923
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:55,770
Did you have photos or are of
anything that you got in Australia?

1924
01:46:55,771 --> 01:46:59,810
Like what is all the aggregators
are saying? No, they don't.

1925
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:05,070
The behavioral patterns and and what
people describes, there's a little like,

1926
01:47:05,071 --> 01:47:06,600
you know,
maybe the difference between like a,

1927
01:47:06,990 --> 01:47:10,680
like a European gray wolf in a North
American grill. You know what I mean?

1928
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:14,820
Like same genus and all that. But yeah,
there's a lot of photos of wolves.

1929
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:18,630
Yeah. But they didn't, they didn't
do that. The biggest, the biggest,

1930
01:47:18,631 --> 01:47:20,760
they did a three year study on wolverines.

1931
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,680
Almost wolverine you see on shows
aren't wildlife parks. They're there.

1932
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:28,080
They've been like babies that were
captured when her mother got killed or

1933
01:47:28,081 --> 01:47:30,540
whatever.
But they did a three year study,

1934
01:47:31,230 --> 01:47:34,710
millions of dollars spent on this and
the only footage they got was from like

1935
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:38,550
four to 500 yards away on a
snowfield of a wolverine going away.

1936
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:40,080
And that was a well-equipped,

1937
01:47:40,081 --> 01:47:44,670
professionally funded looking for a known
animal and they got one clip in three

1938
01:47:44,671 --> 01:47:47,730
years. That's pretty crazy.
Yeah. It's like snow leopards.

1939
01:47:47,731 --> 01:47:50,820
They didn't get any footage of snow
leopards until like 2007 do you think that

1940
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:55,800
people just underestimate the
amount of actual forest? God, yeah.

1941
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:59,790
You don't need a million acres
of forest for a squash to hide.

1942
01:47:59,970 --> 01:48:02,670
But you think you would because
otherwise people would run into it.

1943
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:05,180
People run into them all the time.
They're seeing all,

1944
01:48:05,250 --> 01:48:09,180
it's just not that you guys expected
me ever waver. I need a fucking photo.

1945
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:12,680
Just one. Just one. And
you don't find any of this?

1946
01:48:12,681 --> 01:48:15,690
I then I've been with squatters
and stuff that had said like, yeah,

1947
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:20,070
I had my camera around my neck or I was
holding it and I saw it and it looked at

1948
01:48:20,071 --> 01:48:24,000
me and they just shit their pants and
froze and even after the thing was gone,

1949
01:48:24,001 --> 01:48:27,450
I didn't even think of to take
a picture of toe was gone. Yeah.

1950
01:48:27,451 --> 01:48:31,890
I'm looking at this, a Canadian, the
new Canadian big foot footage. Is it?

1951
01:48:31,891 --> 01:48:33,480
The one on the side of the
road is down on the side,

1952
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:37,860
stand down like below the below.
He's like walking through a trail.

1953
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:40,130
None of those things just,
it's just a car drives by,

1954
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:44,240
it's down on the side of the road
standing there. Oh really? No.

1955
01:48:45,190 --> 01:48:48,110
This one's different. This one's
a dude walking through the world.

1956
01:48:48,120 --> 01:48:50,640
When I say hillbilly, I don't mean
any negative connotation of that.

1957
01:48:50,641 --> 01:48:54,630
Like to me it's like a, you know,
compliment a hillbilly as a compliment.

1958
01:48:54,650 --> 01:48:58,200
I do like I say redneck and Hillbilly,
I don't mean anything bad by it at all.

1959
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:58,531
Well,

1960
01:48:58,531 --> 01:49:01,950
a lot of rednecks to like being rednecks
and hillbillies don't like being called

1961
01:49:01,951 --> 01:49:05,480
the hillbillies, you know? No, I found
that out the hard way. Well this,

1962
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:10,110
well they tried to fight. You does get
mad at him? Yeah, they'd get offended.

1963
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:12,170
Like one of the witnesses has
got really mad that I, you know,

1964
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:14,400
I was just joking around like mad
some hillbilly shit there, you know,

1965
01:49:14,401 --> 01:49:18,870
ball and he got real offended and it
was like, well, he's probably crazy.

1966
01:49:18,871 --> 01:49:22,180
That's why he's making a big foot
story and getting offended here.

1967
01:49:22,220 --> 01:49:27,210
You son of a bitch is the original
original video is over an hour long.

1968
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:33,510
So what were they doing? They were driving
around. Yeah. This one. It's real quick.

1969
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:37,830
It's either, uh, either it's
a dude t they're racist video.

1970
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:43,730
Where's this thing down? The right,
right, right there. Highlight it.

1971
01:49:43,890 --> 01:49:46,780
Wow.
What

1972
01:49:55,140 --> 01:49:58,440
my not saying that you don't see
where it's to the shadow starts.

1973
01:49:58,441 --> 01:49:59,940
It's right in front of the first shot

1974
01:50:00,110 --> 01:50:02,470
right there.
See

1975
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:06,950
really if you go one more couple
more frames, it's really clear

1976
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:11,443
right there.

1977
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:16,600
But that photo they just showed oddly
enough with like a million times better

1978
01:50:16,601 --> 01:50:21,100
has it loose and vague as
fuck. That was that. So good.

1979
01:50:21,101 --> 01:50:22,240
Then this

1980
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:30,340
which is on. Oh that is kind of weird.
But it seems me to go investigate it.

1981
01:50:30,420 --> 01:50:34,190
It seems like a trick of lighting
and shadows to me. Really? Yeah.

1982
01:50:34,191 --> 01:50:35,510
Cause it seems like it's moot ball.

1983
01:50:35,511 --> 01:50:37,970
Maybe it's just because of the
resolution of the video. It could be.

1984
01:50:37,971 --> 01:50:40,990
We're going to go check it out
on the side right there. Right.

1985
01:50:41,420 --> 01:50:44,120
That's the clearest.
Well there's of their own video.

1986
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:47,780
They went back later and filmed it
and it's not there or it's not there.

1987
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:50,070
So it's either a man in a
suit or a squash. I see.

1988
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:53,780
Okay.

1989
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:58,580
And then these guys, these, this video,
this would have been right here. Yeah.

1990
01:50:58,581 --> 01:51:03,080
That's so clear. And I mean
this is the same, same footage

1991
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:04,820
there,
you know.

1992
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:10,950
Listen man, that's some shadows I
can kid money. Don't go on that trip.

1993
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:16,020
Can we got to go look at something?
How many sightings do you guys get?

1994
01:51:16,110 --> 01:51:19,050
Like a month that uh,
that they asked you to investigate?

1995
01:51:19,550 --> 01:51:23,890
Oh, well there's like the shit, I'm not
going to wade through all this shit.

1996
01:51:23,900 --> 01:51:24,711
Like look at every video.

1997
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:27,380
Like they have a whole production
team that just all I did was scour the

1998
01:51:27,381 --> 01:51:28,820
Internet.
Look for everyday there's a new video.

1999
01:51:28,821 --> 01:51:32,420
Put up your worry now that the show's a
hit that people might still faking it.

2000
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,630
Oh totally. We already are. We're
getting that. He must be right.

2001
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:38,260
I mean we're pretty good. I
mean we've been doing this
be clip metal. All they do,

2002
01:51:38,270 --> 01:51:42,320
there's like 20 years. We're pretty good
at filtering people out pretty quick.

2003
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:46,820
Like we caught one guy hugs and in
the Ohio Epa side really wasn't. Yeah,

2004
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,550
Brian's from so blame him.

2005
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:52,460
They don't and they don't want us to
see a lot of stuff ahead of time if they

2006
01:51:52,461 --> 01:51:53,810
want us to be surprised when we see it.

2007
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:57,240
We all know it just cause we're in
the big community. But you know,

2008
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,710
I didn't see that video before and I'm
looking at it on a monitor this big.

2009
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:04,460
And then when you see it on home,
like on a big high def TV and everyone,

2010
01:52:04,461 --> 01:52:06,950
you are fooled by that video at the
beginning. You know, it's like, well,

2011
01:52:06,951 --> 01:52:09,200
I just saw it on a black and
white monitor, like, you know,

2012
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:12,890
five inch monitor or something.
But it was a guy, you know,

2013
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:17,580
cliff busted him clips straight up,
called the guy a liar, right? Dan?

2014
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:19,790
The guy started like trembling
and tearing up and stuff.

2015
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:26,620
So he's a faker in a bitch. How dare you
sir, with your fake big foot footage.

2016
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:30,060
Listen man, I really want to
believe. I really do. And uh,

2017
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:32,800
I might be a little bit more skeptical
than you, but I hold out hope.

2018
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:36,990
I really believe in.
It's no, it, I wish I,

2019
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:39,990
I wish I shared you enthusiasm. It'd
be fun. I'd be out there with you.

2020
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:43,090
I'm very enthusiastic.
I hope it's real.

2021
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:46,010
I just feel like there's
a lot of fucking lot

2022
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,570
of fuckery afoot, but so I
feel like, yeah, but it's,

2023
01:52:50,630 --> 01:52:54,790
but if any of it's real, it's real. Well
if one of them is a real then it's ready.

2024
01:52:55,510 --> 01:52:59,510
Right. So you're, yeah, so it is
real well if you seen it. Yeah. You,

2025
01:52:59,511 --> 01:53:03,440
what you've seen is on fuckery.
You, you know more than anybody,

2026
01:53:03,441 --> 01:53:06,590
which is probably why
I'm saying you know,

2027
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:09,020
is more than the average person for sure.

2028
01:53:09,630 --> 01:53:12,950
And even more than the average person
researching it because you've seen it.

2029
01:53:13,010 --> 01:53:16,300
Right. How many researchers haven't
seen anything? Does it, has the chicken,

2030
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:20,180
the show ever seen anything? She seems to
be the most skeptical. What's her name?

2031
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:24,050
Renee. Renee. She saw something in
the Olympic peninsula when she were,

2032
01:53:24,110 --> 01:53:28,910
the Olympic project is where I just got
back this weekend. She saw something,

2033
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:32,690
she doesn't say what it was. She said it,
it looked like it was tall and it was,

2034
01:53:33,030 --> 01:53:36,530
and there was like a arm, like
an arm and she, she's like,

2035
01:53:36,531 --> 01:53:38,510
what could have been a
bear walking upright?

2036
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:41,870
Or it could have been a bear that was
just starting to drop down as it was

2037
01:53:41,871 --> 01:53:45,020
running, like picking up speed on two
legs, getting ready to drop down and,

2038
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:50,660
and but it, she probably saw squatch
she's the most skeptical out of the group.

2039
01:53:50,661 --> 01:53:52,490
Would you agree with that?
That's her job too.

2040
01:53:52,491 --> 01:53:54,920
I mean there's been times where she
was like, Holy Shit though as a squash.

2041
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:56,540
And they're like, you
can't say that. You know,

2042
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:58,240
like oh they tell her
she can't say nothing.

2043
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,450
We're in Oregon when we recorded
those ones, 2000 I think it's like,

2044
01:54:02,451 --> 01:54:05,690
did they do that? They, they'd tell
you what you, you're supposed to,

2045
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:08,700
what role you're supposed to play in
the show and she plays the skeptic role.

2046
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:10,610
Yeah, we'll just, when we
were in Oregon, she was like,

2047
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:13,580
when it happened she was like, oh my God,
that had like, that had to be a squash.

2048
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:15,200
I had to be a squash. We're like, look,

2049
01:54:15,201 --> 01:54:20,060
you can't see why they say she can't
say that. Cause then I guess like,

2050
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:22,300
you know,
then she wouldn't be taking [inaudible].

2051
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:25,670
I'm probably gonna get totally in trouble
for having said that. Probably. Yeah.

2052
01:54:25,671 --> 01:54:28,630
Well they don't, well they say they
never been a part of her cause she,

2053
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:30,890
she represents all the people
at home that are skeptical.

2054
01:54:30,891 --> 01:54:33,110
That's her job is to represent them.
Like what would they say?

2055
01:54:33,111 --> 01:54:35,450
Like the person that thinks it's
all bullshit, what would they,

2056
01:54:35,660 --> 01:54:39,770
she's supposed to ask the question
that that person did she, when,

2057
01:54:39,771 --> 01:54:41,540
when she was seeing something,

2058
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:46,250
what did she see that made her so
convinced she didn't see? She heard her.

2059
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:49,940
What'd she here do? We heard two
squatters call them back and forth.

2060
01:54:49,941 --> 01:54:54,680
I've been Malala river in Oregon and it's,
it's on the episode, but dude, it was,

2061
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:58,460
if you've heard of Murphy's law, Murphy's
laws and nothing, squatters laws,

2062
01:54:58,461 --> 01:55:02,600
way worse. Like what squashes law.
If something's gonna go wrong, right?

2063
01:55:02,601 --> 01:55:07,040
When that happens, it will, like
your battery dies or whatever.

2064
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:09,360
Like just whatever it may be happens,
right?

2065
01:55:09,361 --> 01:55:13,400
When we've got a call from the network
one, camera B, whatever isn't working,

2066
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:16,100
there's no, all the tape you sent
us is blank. And we get this call.

2067
01:55:16,101 --> 01:55:18,290
We're out in the woods and it was
like when it finally came through,

2068
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:19,640
somebody would come back from camp,

2069
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:21,470
like the messages come in earlier
that day and they're like,

2070
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:24,140
you got to check the camera
right now and check the audio.

2071
01:55:24,141 --> 01:55:26,180
Like there's nothing sync that
and it just turned out to,

2072
01:55:26,181 --> 01:55:30,350
the editor was totally blowing
it but we stopped all filming.

2073
01:55:30,620 --> 01:55:34,150
He was putting the camera back into
playback mode to see what he had the song.

2074
01:55:34,151 --> 01:55:37,940
I was checking his stuff. I had a pair
of boxers, it wasn't part of their stuff.

2075
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,540
I had a parabolic to record and it was
going from like would clear up and get

2076
01:55:41,541 --> 01:55:45,060
really cold and like kind of clawed back
up and then get a little bit warmer.

2077
01:55:45,420 --> 01:55:47,520
So I had like five layers.
I was taken off the lyrics,

2078
01:55:47,521 --> 01:55:51,090
I was burning up and I had the
parabolic that were in pitch black.

2079
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:54,510
I put the paralogue in the brush and these
things started screaming and I got my

2080
01:55:54,511 --> 01:55:57,630
job. I like my whatever, my thermal,

2081
01:55:57,631 --> 01:56:00,320
I'm pulling off over my head
right when this happens and we're,

2082
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:03,510
everyone's like holy shit. Like, you know,
when it first happened were like no way.

2083
01:56:03,890 --> 01:56:07,050
And then by the time we got up and
then the salads from between me and the

2084
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:10,770
camera guy was like, the whole crew is
between me shy of the parabolic dish here.

2085
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,970
And all it picked up was just these
guys, you know, ripping up and Velcro,

2086
01:56:14,971 --> 01:56:17,760
like uncovering stuff. And because
it had been raining on and off,

2087
01:56:18,050 --> 01:56:21,960
guys going no way talk. And so you can't
hear any, nothing comes to a parabolic.

2088
01:56:22,490 --> 01:56:25,930
I mean it's that fuel the,
and then we hear stuff at homes,

2089
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:29,700
this is what I want them to
put more effort into this
as capturing what we hear.

2090
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:33,180
Like we were the mics that are made to
block out all sound except for us talking.

2091
01:56:33,290 --> 01:56:36,480
Right, exactly. And they don't
pick up screams in the distance.

2092
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:39,330
They're designed not to.
So,

2093
01:56:39,390 --> 01:56:42,510
but we do have a guy that's going out
of this now that has the parabolic and

2094
01:56:42,511 --> 01:56:44,490
he's, you know, but
you have to be pointed,

2095
01:56:44,491 --> 01:56:46,980
like if it's coming from right
there and you're appointed here,

2096
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:48,440
you might not get it right.

2097
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:51,990
Like you gotta be pointed right at it
and we don't have the best gear for that.

2098
01:56:51,991 --> 01:56:53,100
He's like,
it's kind of Hokey.

2099
01:56:53,370 --> 01:56:56,790
Do you know like when you hear something
in the woods too, it's kind of weird.

2100
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,250
Things echo off of trees and stuff.

2101
01:56:59,251 --> 01:57:03,780
It's hard to pinpoint exactly where
it's coming from. I totally like my ear.

2102
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:07,300
Um, like I was, you know, big time
and a servant for a long time.

2103
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:11,400
Oh you got that soul surfer. Yeah.
So I have one grows and your, yeah,

2104
01:57:11,401 --> 01:57:16,050
and it's worse than my left ear and a
fix that with surgery. Yeah they can,

2105
01:57:16,051 --> 01:57:19,830
I got to get it done. But my hearings
really good though. It's like, but it's,

2106
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:22,830
my ear will cause the cavities
so small can clog up easy.

2107
01:57:22,831 --> 01:57:27,270
So sometimes it's clogged and whatever's
like, they shouldn't always show going.

2108
01:57:27,271 --> 01:57:29,880
Is that a squash or something like that?
And they never show like where we go.

2109
01:57:29,881 --> 01:57:31,380
Like, you know, after
we hear the Giggling,

2110
01:57:31,770 --> 01:57:36,540
oh that was a coyote or that was a
bear or whatever. It was edited Hokey.

2111
01:57:36,541 --> 01:57:39,000
They tried to make it a little
bit about season one. They did.

2112
01:57:39,001 --> 01:57:41,050
I thought season two, they
did a good job. And, um,

2113
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:43,340
season three we'll see how they
do that. I mean, season two,

2114
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:46,530
the editors did a great job.
I'll show. Got Way better.

2115
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:50,100
How many seasons have you done so far?
This one re we shot through,

2116
01:57:50,101 --> 01:57:54,810
they've shown two seasons. We just
finished the third, like 10 more episodes.

2117
01:57:55,200 --> 01:57:58,800
We just got picked up for seasons
four and five. We start next month.

2118
01:57:58,801 --> 01:58:01,170
So they're going to start
Erin season three in the fall.

2119
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:03,690
We'll already be puppet
in episodes for four.

2120
01:58:03,691 --> 01:58:07,320
And so they're going to air like seven
and a half months straight every Sunday

2121
01:58:07,321 --> 01:58:11,420
in new episode. So that's awesome.
So when you go out there or how,

2122
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:14,940
how many,
like if you take a hundred trips,

2123
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:19,590
how many trips do you hear something
or see some footprint or something? Um,

2124
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:26,420
uh, it seems to go in waves. Like, I mean,

2125
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:30,600
I haven't seen a squash since 2007 so
I haven't seen anything for five years

2126
01:58:30,601 --> 01:58:33,240
being out there a lot. And that's
gotta be frustrating. Yeah.

2127
01:58:33,241 --> 01:58:37,530
But from 2000 well is there, which I
never, I never, I don't tell this story.

2128
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:41,770
I don't count it because it was just
so frustrating. But my buddy and bart,

2129
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,380
we got flooded.
We note were,

2130
01:58:43,420 --> 01:58:47,680
we know we got some but it was such
an old school kind of shitty thermal.

2131
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:51,580
It's just this big blurry heat things
you can't, you can't prove any of that.

2132
01:58:51,581 --> 01:58:55,270
We know like all the sounds are with
it. What happened? It was a squatch.

2133
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:59,920
I was walking back out of the same place
that it was big rainstorm and cliff.

2134
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:03,990
They got in a show at me. The other
guy cliff, he had this guy, Walter,

2135
01:59:03,991 --> 01:59:05,810
he invented the ACDC adapter is,

2136
01:59:05,811 --> 01:59:09,820
it's like billionaire guy that was funding
us finance equipment and clip it just

2137
01:59:09,821 --> 01:59:13,420
fried as recording unit,
like a $1,500 a unit in the rain.

2138
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:15,160
And while I told us like,
hey,

2139
01:59:15,161 --> 01:59:18,940
you guys can't be keep blowing cause
he grew up poor even though he's like a

2140
01:59:18,941 --> 01:59:20,380
billionaire guy, he's still, he grew up,

2141
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:23,350
you know he's frugal guy like hey you
guys can't be frying stuff out in the rain

2142
01:59:23,351 --> 01:59:25,540
if it's raining, just put
the stuff away, you know.

2143
01:59:25,930 --> 01:59:29,170
So I was walking back out
and end up run the thermal,

2144
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,480
it has a waterproof flat,

2145
01:59:31,510 --> 01:59:35,650
you have to open that stick in a cord that
goes to a recording yet cause it does.

2146
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:39,670
Now we have built recorders with thermal
but then we did it and I was walking

2147
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:44,671
back out and I got back down where we'd
seen it three weeks before and it hadn't

2148
01:59:44,891 --> 01:59:45,641
been a peep on that.

2149
01:59:45,641 --> 01:59:49,180
And usually all the action happens way
back up where I was coming from and I had

2150
01:59:49,181 --> 01:59:50,710
walked a few miles,

2151
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:54,310
my truck was parked right out the hop
right off the highway next to some houses

2152
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:57,730
and the thing ran,
it was just standing behind my truck.

2153
01:59:57,990 --> 02:00:01,570
And if I had filmed it it
would be clear cut. Like, no,

2154
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,990
it was way taller than the back
of my truck. I have a shell,

2155
02:00:04,991 --> 02:00:08,820
it's about this high and it was
above the shell. So when I filmed it,

2156
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:11,620
why didn't feel it?
I looked at it right when I pulled my,

2157
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:14,950
thrown them out of my pocket.
I'm looking at it and there's water,

2158
02:00:14,951 --> 02:00:18,280
big Robert Water drops coming down.
It like went blurry really quick,

2159
02:00:18,281 --> 02:00:18,971
what I was looking at.

2160
02:00:18,971 --> 02:00:22,150
But you could see it for a second
and it just ran up the driveway.

2161
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:24,370
And I'd never tell that
story cause everyone's like,

2162
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:27,700
you had a recording in it and you didn't
record it. Like, you know, Blah Blah Blah.

2163
02:00:28,300 --> 02:00:32,500
That's gotta be frustrating as
fuck dude did it. That was like,

2164
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:36,280
did you ever get tired of people
saying that you're crazy? No,

2165
02:00:36,281 --> 02:00:39,880
it says that no one,
when you talked to regular folks,

2166
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:43,300
just like firmly embedded it. I
don't give a shit. I know I'm right.

2167
02:00:43,330 --> 02:00:46,870
I know I'm right. I don't care what they
say. I know. To me it's like people going,

2168
02:00:47,100 --> 02:00:49,930
you're crazy that you know that
the sun goes around the earth.

2169
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:53,440
So for you it's just a matter of time.
It's just I know it's coming out.

2170
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,700
I know it's going to come out like all
this stuff going on. There's no way.

2171
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,600
And I mean people are talking about how
there's not better footage and we'll

2172
02:01:00,601 --> 02:01:02,560
look who's trying to get the footage.
It's guys like me,

2173
02:01:02,561 --> 02:01:07,030
you know like Sony and camcorders
and it's not professional.

2174
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:10,150
It's hard to get equipment
back to where these things are.

2175
02:01:10,151 --> 02:01:14,170
If you really talking about deep with
berries, like all that kind of stuff,

2176
02:01:14,171 --> 02:01:16,810
like generators, how long do you stay
out there when you do like a camp?

2177
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:21,840
When you go squatch and like me and
cliff did a two month or one time to ma.

2178
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:25,990
Not Deep, but we'd come back
and supply up. I was like,

2179
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:28,690
that was the longest we
went straight months.

2180
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:32,440
So what you would go back like how
often to civilization to get supplies

2181
02:01:33,340 --> 02:01:36,280
whenever we wanted like
it at least once a week.

2182
02:01:36,340 --> 02:01:40,220
You were just camping out there for
two months? Yeah. Yeah. Jesus Christ

2183
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:43,130
and then home home for like a
couple of weeks ago I went fishing.

2184
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:46,860
Did you get paid some money when you
were out there for two months? Filmed it?

2185
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:48,830
Nothing. No. Cliff took a year,

2186
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:52,820
something cliff lived in Long Beach as
a school teacher and I was like, dude,

2187
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:54,830
you know, all his TV companies have
been call me, but they're going to,

2188
02:01:54,831 --> 02:01:57,560
we're going to get a Shugg on.
Just quit your job, come up,

2189
02:01:57,561 --> 02:02:00,290
we'll go squatch and just
quit your job slayer house.

2190
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:04,400
We'll go squatch them for a year. And yet
he did. Wow. And we were out for like,

2191
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:08,040
Brian was ready to do that right now.
At least felt like seven months ago.

2192
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:10,760
We did about seven months of
that year out in the woods,

2193
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:14,030
seven months out thermals and
we'd drive at night. You know,

2194
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:17,090
we'd drive these roads. Real slug. We had
it pretty wild, like to get good like,

2195
02:02:17,810 --> 02:02:18,650
and uh,

2196
02:02:19,220 --> 02:02:22,460
we thought it was going to be game
over because I'd hurt him so many times

2197
02:02:22,461 --> 02:02:22,750
around me.

2198
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:26,390
Comfort and growl and snap branches and
stomp their feet walking around on two

2199
02:02:26,391 --> 02:02:30,140
feet and stuff like that that I just
thought with a thermal, it's going to be,

2200
02:02:30,830 --> 02:02:31,641
give us a week,

2201
02:02:31,641 --> 02:02:35,690
we'll have footage two weeks max and I
have it and it's not the case at all.

2202
02:02:35,691 --> 02:02:38,570
Like they,
they,

2203
02:02:38,571 --> 02:02:43,490
I think they've been shot at so many
times that even when it's pitch black,

2204
02:02:43,550 --> 02:02:47,030
they still are always taking that
evasive action they can see in the dark.

2205
02:02:47,060 --> 02:02:48,140
Oh yeah.
I know they can.

2206
02:02:48,380 --> 02:02:52,250
They can definitely see in the dark for
nocturnal creatures. For the most part,

2207
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:54,570
they're there. They'll come on
the day to like, like, you know,

2208
02:02:54,610 --> 02:02:56,240
never seen their eyes up close to it.
Right.

2209
02:02:56,430 --> 02:03:00,110
When I see something I seen other I
the one I saw the daylight, the eye,

2210
02:03:00,350 --> 02:03:03,020
it was this, the way the sun was
coming down, it's, I was so deep set,

2211
02:03:03,021 --> 02:03:04,700
it's brown was out so far.
I couldn't see that.

2212
02:03:04,701 --> 02:03:06,890
I remember that was one thing that
struck me because it was that quick.

2213
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:11,330
But the one thing I remember really
clearly was the hair was real shiny.

2214
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:14,720
It was super skinny.
It was the arm was,

2215
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:16,460
it's going to say this one was,

2216
02:03:16,461 --> 02:03:19,760
all the ones I've seen at night were
bulky except where I saw one about your

2217
02:03:19,761 --> 02:03:22,490
size. Like a lot of it was
about five 10 look like,

2218
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:24,860
like a high school linebacker
or something like five,

2219
02:03:24,861 --> 02:03:29,570
10 to 20 something like that. So it
was an adolescence. I try. Yeah. Yeah.

2220
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:30,463
And uh,

2221
02:03:30,560 --> 02:03:34,880
but these are the big ones I saw were
all bull like bulky and you know,

2222
02:03:34,881 --> 02:03:39,500
these are all through night vision or
thermal from far away and a lot of fucking

2223
02:03:39,501 --> 02:03:43,820
food. They would think it would do a
lot of damage and leave shit everywhere.

2224
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:48,090
Well they've been seen shit in like
flowing water and in late like there are

2225
02:03:48,100 --> 02:03:50,320
conscious about hiding their scat.
Like they really,

2226
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:51,590
they just don't shit in the trail.

2227
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:55,280
So you think they're like smart enough
to know that people are a threat?

2228
02:03:55,281 --> 02:03:59,660
Actively avoid people who they are kind
of people there are kind of people. Well,

2229
02:03:59,661 --> 02:04:03,620
I mean that foot's a footprint of a
fucking human. No, no. If there's,

2230
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:08,180
there's no model. Do you know what I
mean? It's built the big toe down hall,

2231
02:04:08,181 --> 02:04:12,560
Middle Toe. I mean, not a
gorilla for sure. It looks
like a giant human footprint.

2232
02:04:12,770 --> 02:04:14,540
Superficially. It looks
like a human. Well,

2233
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:16,850
there's nothing else like
that in the primary world.

2234
02:04:16,851 --> 02:04:19,520
It hasn't felt like that us and well,

2235
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:23,170
that's another interesting thing
that came to light recently. Um, uh,

2236
02:04:23,180 --> 02:04:25,580
scientifically over the last decade,
they found that,

2237
02:04:25,850 --> 02:04:30,850
I think they call them homo floresiensis
from orient wait at Flory ansys.

2238
02:04:30,891 --> 02:04:34,190
Is that it? Oh God, Chris going to kill
me. He's always taught me how to say it,

2239
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:35,870
right. Because I've always said
it wrong because when I read it,

2240
02:04:35,871 --> 02:04:39,000
I'd say it in my head.
Yeah. Rock Larissa Ansys.

2241
02:04:39,150 --> 02:04:42,090
Okay. Well what it is folks
that it's really like a Hobbit,

2242
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:46,650
like a real hobbit that really did
exist and may even eight, eight people,

2243
02:04:46,890 --> 02:04:50,910
they might, there's a lot of evidence
that they're still there. Really? Yeah.

2244
02:04:51,060 --> 02:04:52,080
Well this,
this thing,

2245
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:56,460
they found bones recently
within the last decade and um,

2246
02:04:56,480 --> 02:04:57,750
but really fascinating stuff.

2247
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:02,550
The absolutely know that a very small
type of human being existed and it was

2248
02:05:02,551 --> 02:05:07,380
really like a, it's not like a
dwarf or like a mutation or a,

2249
02:05:07,381 --> 02:05:12,030
you know, a genetic screw up or anything
like that. It's a whole species,

2250
02:05:12,031 --> 02:05:15,840
a different completely different
species of human being that, um,

2251
02:05:15,870 --> 02:05:18,300
they call it the florists man or two.
It's,

2252
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:21,780
they called it like a modern day
hobbit and it's, it's amazing.

2253
02:05:21,781 --> 02:05:26,430
I mean this is something that
was mythological up until
just a few years ago and

2254
02:05:26,431 --> 02:05:30,720
now fact scientific fact,
they know for sure this existed.

2255
02:05:30,721 --> 02:05:35,190
This is a real small animal. And where
do they think this thing's still lives?

2256
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,160
Um, well maybe the Cape
York peninsula of Australia,

2257
02:05:38,161 --> 02:05:42,330
like the Stranger Torres through their
lecture in Australia and going up in an

2258
02:05:42,331 --> 02:05:45,630
age of, there's reports of them on
islands up in there to this day.

2259
02:05:46,110 --> 02:05:49,050
And then in the 80s
I'm a really respected,

2260
02:05:49,051 --> 02:05:50,970
he was a missionary to the
aboriginals up in the kit. You know,

2261
02:05:50,971 --> 02:05:53,820
that Cape York peninsula goes up in,
I'll start that big point. It goes up.

2262
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:56,670
There's only like one road that goes
around it. There, it's just empty.

2263
02:05:57,270 --> 02:06:01,740
And he was up there like visiting his
rural remote villages and he got a pack of

2264
02:06:01,741 --> 02:06:02,430
them came up on him.

2265
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:07,320
And what he described that
he had a forensic artist
draw what he saw back then.

2266
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:07,730
It,

2267
02:06:07,730 --> 02:06:11,790
it matches exactly what the
reconstructions are from
the remains they found in

2268
02:06:11,791 --> 02:06:16,350
Flores island. Why the Flores
man? Like, it's uh, um,

2269
02:06:16,440 --> 02:06:19,020
how many do you think live up there?
They don't know.

2270
02:06:19,021 --> 02:06:20,300
And they don't even know that there's,

2271
02:06:20,350 --> 02:06:23,220
like the aboriginal said they haven't
seen him. They said they're still around,

2272
02:06:23,221 --> 02:06:26,790
but they haven't seen him in a while.
Well, they said they haven't seen him.

2273
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:28,890
We didn't talk to him and
see them within 10 years,

2274
02:06:28,891 --> 02:06:32,130
but they're supposedly up and
those islands up in there still.

2275
02:06:32,340 --> 02:06:34,950
And then there's another type
of big foot up in those. Um,

2276
02:06:35,460 --> 02:06:37,230
we've talked to this guy,
he's on Australia, Bro.

2277
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:41,190
He's like their version of like a
like public radio down in Australia,

2278
02:06:41,191 --> 02:06:44,970
the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
He's the naturalists for them.

2279
02:06:44,971 --> 02:06:49,080
Like he identifies calls this
and that. He's a phd. He saw one,

2280
02:06:49,120 --> 02:06:51,010
and I'm Papa New Guinea,

2281
02:06:51,011 --> 02:06:56,011
yet like 9,000 feet doing a bird
survey for the UN back in the 70s.

2282
02:06:56,370 --> 02:06:59,370
I mean, so that they're see
their, their seating islands too,

2283
02:06:59,371 --> 02:07:02,270
which is pretty trippy and well in 2004 B,

2284
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:07,710
if you ask any anthropologist how many,
how many, how many hominids like us,

2285
02:07:07,711 --> 02:07:11,820
you know, like homo branch, like Homo
Erectus was alive 30,000 years ago.

2286
02:07:11,821 --> 02:07:16,821
The answer would have been to Neanderthal
homosapien and now it's for you notice

2287
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:21,510
that the hobbits and then that
they found that new kind of tall,

2288
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:23,730
like when they call it [inaudible] or uh,

2289
02:07:23,790 --> 02:07:28,010
the one up in Russia they found two years
ago and they got the DNA chai knuckle

2290
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:30,210
boom, the knuckle bones,
like twice as big as a human.

2291
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:31,740
And they got DNA out of that.

2292
02:07:31,741 --> 02:07:35,990
So now there's four hominid species that
are known and one squatch comes out. And

2293
02:07:36,020 --> 02:07:37,420
what with the,

2294
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:41,590
from talking to people that I know that
we're part of the DNA study is that,

2295
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:47,190
that it's not a tree, it's not the
homo homosapiens like how humans came.

2296
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:52,150
The Homo branch isn't a tree.
It's a very bushy plant.

2297
02:07:52,270 --> 02:07:56,620
It's, it's, it's a lot of lateral,
a lot of crossing. And uh,

2298
02:07:56,650 --> 02:08:01,280
what the DNA shows is that there's
five types of homage species in,

2299
02:08:01,281 --> 02:08:02,560
in I'm in us,

2300
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:07,040
there wasn't these clean breaks coming
down through like most people are part

2301
02:08:07,420 --> 02:08:11,950
neanderthal. Most white bull spread.
Everyone that's not like your audience.

2302
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:15,690
Let's say that one MMA
fighter is our Lawsky.

2303
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:20,560
Maybe it's 10% what's really, yeah,
there's some, where'd you hear that?

2304
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:21,413
Um,

2305
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:22,360
yeah.

2306
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:25,430
God, I was I talking to you. It was
some of those, part of that genetic say,

2307
02:08:25,431 --> 02:08:26,500
but they've,
they've got,

2308
02:08:26,770 --> 02:08:31,770
they've got people with 12 think I
would have heard that there was 12% DNA,

2309
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:34,750
12% in the top 12%.

2310
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:37,210
Deana told DNA and people that can in a,

2311
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:41,920
you like that area of above Mongolia
Far East Russia. Really? Yeah.

2312
02:08:41,921 --> 02:08:45,010
They've found and we're, you're,
if you're, if you're European,

2313
02:08:45,011 --> 02:08:49,600
you're at least 2% like you have
at least 2% nan or tall. Did you,

2314
02:08:49,601 --> 02:08:53,620
uh, have you seen that footage that's
been going around the Internet recently?

2315
02:08:53,621 --> 02:08:58,220
We talked about it on yesterday's podcast,
the atoll and versatile space,

2316
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:01,510
like the one picture where it's sitting
there on a rock looking over. No,

2317
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:05,140
the aunt and neanderthal that looks like
a gorilla besides the guy's idea that

2318
02:09:05,141 --> 02:09:06,580
they weren't,
they didn't look like us.

2319
02:09:06,581 --> 02:09:09,580
They at black skin like gorilla and they
were really scary and muscular and they

2320
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:14,020
fed on people and they were like a, a
super predator. He's already got that.

2321
02:09:14,021 --> 02:09:17,500
That there has been refuted. Yeah. Yeah.
But it's fascinating. There's a picture,

2322
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:18,770
there's a picture of a,
um,

2323
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:21,580
possible Dan or tall just taking like
last week that's up on the Internet.

2324
02:09:21,581 --> 02:09:25,600
Have you seen that? No. Well, Doctor
Melbourne, like he's impressed with it.

2325
02:09:25,601 --> 02:09:29,680
He doesn't authenticate it, but he, they
think there might still be neanderthals.

2326
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:33,430
Oh yeah. You haven't heard that? No. Oh
Dude. Who thinks it might be neanderthal?

2327
02:09:33,431 --> 02:09:36,850
A lot of scientists over in,
in Russia for one thing.

2328
02:09:37,700 --> 02:09:38,030
Okay.

2329
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:42,770
I don't see anything about his
DNA and China's, um, uh, there,

2330
02:09:42,780 --> 02:09:46,450
there are launching, um, well they,
they have urine over in China.

2331
02:09:46,490 --> 02:09:47,390
We're probably gonna go,
we're there.

2332
02:09:47,391 --> 02:09:48,930
We're probably going to go
to Russia and China. Look,

2333
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:50,390
check that stuff out on the show.

2334
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:52,180
Okay.

2335
02:09:52,180 --> 02:09:53,960
Well in China they have a,
an animal,

2336
02:09:53,990 --> 02:09:58,490
they set aside a whole national park
forum recently. What? Yeah, urine Y,

2337
02:09:58,491 --> 02:10:03,380
r e n. And what is this thing?
Supposedly like a Yeti. Yeti.

2338
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:08,750
So, uh, it's in the Himalayas.
Tibet. They, this range out.

2339
02:10:09,180 --> 02:10:12,880
Then I remember like that there's
some of the best photos were, uh,

2340
02:10:13,010 --> 02:10:16,190
from the Himalaya,
so of footprints and shipping photo.

2341
02:10:16,430 --> 02:10:21,230
And there was a scalp dude, I can, I
know that whole story inside and out.

2342
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:23,510
Yeah. Whatever happened when
that scalp that they'd found,

2343
02:10:23,511 --> 02:10:26,060
did they ever figured out
what that thing is? Well,

2344
02:10:26,970 --> 02:10:27,720
okay.

2345
02:10:27,720 --> 02:10:31,320
For the monks, uh, Peter Burns
stole some of this stuff.

2346
02:10:31,321 --> 02:10:34,070
He's still alive up in Oregon.
He's about 85, 86. He was an

2347
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,830
event. He was on those original
expeditions in the 50s.

2348
02:10:37,150 --> 02:10:40,640
He's still involved in big
foot research, but, um,

2349
02:10:41,750 --> 02:10:44,950
there's two different, there's two
stores and I'm not sure how they crossed,

2350
02:10:44,951 --> 02:10:46,310
but they would,

2351
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:49,190
they replace the stuff that was
out that people could look at with,

2352
02:10:49,290 --> 02:10:53,930
with goat skins. And just sewed it like
the Yeti, but they actually kept the Yeti,

2353
02:10:54,010 --> 02:10:58,970
the Yeti scalp and like a sacred box.
And the other story is that,

2354
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:03,710
um, you knew who was a big part
of this was uh, Jimmy, um, God,

2355
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:07,730
you know, uh, Mr. Smith goes
to Washington. Jimmy Stewart.

2356
02:11:08,140 --> 02:11:12,760
Oh really? He's looking
for Sasquatch high. Well,

2357
02:11:12,761 --> 02:11:15,970
they're looking at, he was a hue acts
snitch by the way. He was a what?

2358
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:19,570
You accidentally does that House on an
American affairs committee though when

2359
02:11:19,571 --> 02:11:22,590
they blackballed all the people
in Hollywood penis. Yeah, he was,

2360
02:11:23,070 --> 02:11:26,410
he was the guy that ratted out all
the guys anyways. Well what a Dick.

2361
02:11:26,440 --> 02:11:30,370
He was a full on, I'm like
anti evolutionary, like uh,

2362
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,110
really creationist.
Ah,

2363
02:11:32,380 --> 02:11:37,310
cause I'm on the air on the throne and
he uh, and it's gone. There's a big four,

2364
02:11:37,660 --> 02:11:38,170
there's a,

2365
02:11:38,170 --> 02:11:43,170
there's a book coming out about detailing
how he was buying these remains that

2366
02:11:44,111 --> 02:11:48,550
it would come out of Asia. Like he bought
like a checkout on pivot, get stuff.

2367
02:11:48,551 --> 02:11:50,200
He bought other stuff and
he'd have it destroyed.

2368
02:11:50,290 --> 02:11:53,890
What Jimmy Stewart did that part of
the theory, you know that Minnesota,

2369
02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:59,140
Minnesota ice man, you know the Minnesota
iceman, that blonde eyes. Oh yeah, yeah.

2370
02:11:59,170 --> 02:12:02,950
The guy. I'm like, that's what
they called them, the name.

2371
02:12:03,210 --> 02:12:06,340
Um, well Minnesota ice man
is the most common look. Hey,

2372
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:10,590
punch that up cause you punch that
up. Minnesota ice man. There's a lot.

2373
02:12:10,591 --> 02:12:12,810
Like they didn't, that was uh, uh, uh,

2374
02:12:13,530 --> 02:12:16,050
well the stories either got
shot in Vietnam or in Russia.

2375
02:12:16,051 --> 02:12:20,460
I've got shot above the eye
and this guy is writing a book.

2376
02:12:20,461 --> 02:12:22,290
I know the guy that's right
in the book. He's, you know,

2377
02:12:22,440 --> 02:12:25,770
professor guy and supposedly
there's a lot of Jimmy Stewart

2378
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:28,790
bought that and had it
destroyed. Why? Yeah,

2379
02:12:28,830 --> 02:12:31,140
that's I'm thinking of the wrong thing.
I'm thinking of the uh,

2380
02:12:31,200 --> 02:12:35,390
wasn't Minnesota thinking of the guy they
found the glacier, the ancient oh yeah,

2381
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:39,780
that guy. Yeah. He was a straight
person. This is Minnesota ice man.

2382
02:12:39,790 --> 02:12:42,900
It's all the arm over its head is frozen
in a block of ice and they showed it

2383
02:12:42,901 --> 02:12:46,050
all over and then since it's a hoax,
so

2384
02:12:47,770 --> 02:12:51,840
probably what does that usually
when they say who said it's a hoax?

2385
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:57,310
A Wikipedia? Yeah, it was a hoax.

2386
02:12:57,780 --> 02:13:01,320
Wow. It's just saying it's a hoax. All
they're saying it's a hoax. Period.

2387
02:13:02,070 --> 02:13:03,000
History.

2388
02:13:03,420 --> 02:13:05,130
What does that look up?
Look up the photos.

2389
02:13:06,370 --> 02:13:10,350
Vernal's Hoover men's who was like one
of the top anthropologists in the world

2390
02:13:10,380 --> 02:13:15,180
study that thing. Pretty close. And he
staked his whole rotation and it was real.

2391
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:16,081
And what did he say?

2392
02:13:16,081 --> 02:13:19,890
It was thought it was at neanderthal that
had been shot like a recently shot man

2393
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:22,620
or tall. That's it right
there. That's the face. Yeah,

2394
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:28,350
because the power went out one
time and it started the, the uh,

2395
02:13:28,360 --> 02:13:33,360
I started melting that it was in and they
said a distinct rotten meat odor smell

2396
02:13:34,621 --> 02:13:38,750
was coming out like rotten flesh. Now what
do they think if they think that Nina,

2397
02:13:38,770 --> 02:13:41,340
there are also real, just went
away from it. There's the body.

2398
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:44,430
It's um,

2399
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:48,840
those are your five year old it. Yeah.
Is that it was wrong. Yeah, that's a,

2400
02:13:49,090 --> 02:13:50,560
that's a totally a drawing
cause like look at it.

2401
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:53,500
Yeah, but that's what, that's just
showing you what it looks like.

2402
02:13:53,860 --> 02:13:58,570
Have like exaggerated
sized hands and her feet.

2403
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:01,673
Hmm.

2404
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:05,660
Where's your photos or a phone? There's,
I don't know where, yeah, there's photos.

2405
02:14:05,661 --> 02:14:08,440
There's like video of it and everything.
I mean, I don't know where that is.

2406
02:14:08,450 --> 02:14:12,870
All that. And Jimmy Stewart had
that destroyed [inaudible] I don't,

2407
02:14:12,890 --> 02:14:16,650
I mean that's just this guy.
That's what people he's talking to.

2408
02:14:16,651 --> 02:14:17,400
That's what he's heard.

2409
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:20,250
Well, if we learned anything on
this show, it's fuck Jimmy Stewart.

2410
02:14:21,870 --> 02:14:25,280
I think we learned that.
He usually,

2411
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:30,150
I just strongly believe in Jesus
and don't believe in big foot.

2412
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:31,643
I Dunno man.

2413
02:14:31,770 --> 02:14:35,490
He thought it would shake people's faith
in God if evolution was proven true.

2414
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:39,330
What a silly bitch or Joe Fox
Magic Joe. Well, you know,

2415
02:14:39,331 --> 02:14:43,380
how does that shake your belief in God?
It's even if the Bible was 100% bullshit,

2416
02:14:43,381 --> 02:14:46,920
it shouldn't shake your belief.
It's possible that there could be a god,

2417
02:14:46,921 --> 02:14:50,760
but it's also possible that people are
full of shit. And that story sucks.

2418
02:14:51,570 --> 02:14:55,300
Right? It's, that's like
simple mathematics. Right.

2419
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:59,820
And that if we apply to big foot means
that there's a certain percentage of

2420
02:14:59,821 --> 02:15:03,390
those big foot stories that are bullshit.
But I hope, I hope to real. I hope.

2421
02:15:03,391 --> 02:15:08,340
I hope there's a percentage that are real
and that may be soon we get something.

2422
02:15:08,740 --> 02:15:13,500
Give me something. A fucking photo.
A dead one. What about the DNA?

2423
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:16,890
Hmm. If it comes out to it's true. Yeah.
I mean, what's, if it's pure review,

2424
02:15:16,891 --> 02:15:20,610
study proves, right. Bruce inclusive.
That's the thing that's driving me crazy.

2425
02:15:20,611 --> 02:15:23,460
It's like it's it be out by
now or at least you know, it's,

2426
02:15:23,461 --> 02:15:26,050
it doesn't take that long
to tell you what it is.

2427
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:29,630
It is when it's a new species
and there's no type specimen.

2428
02:15:29,660 --> 02:15:31,270
If they had a type specimen,
it'd be easy.

2429
02:15:31,271 --> 02:15:34,430
But when you have a type specimen
for deer berets, right. Real quick.

2430
02:15:34,431 --> 02:15:37,340
So when there's no type specimen
takes a long time to do the name.

2431
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:41,870
And when there's all kinds of markers
showing homo sapiens and people,

2432
02:15:41,871 --> 02:15:46,430
would people have these misperception
what DNA and how DNA works due to those TV

2433
02:15:46,431 --> 02:15:48,920
shows? CSI and shit.
Yeah, I mean that stuffs,

2434
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:52,130
if you're talking about a cryptid
species that is has nothing to do.

2435
02:15:52,131 --> 02:15:53,480
I mean those guys will,

2436
02:15:53,560 --> 02:15:58,490
you got 3 billion genomes and your DNA
strand and when they go to court they

2437
02:15:58,491 --> 02:15:59,840
just have to line up like seven,

2438
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:04,370
seven of those like certain
markers to get a conviction. Right.

2439
02:16:04,371 --> 02:16:08,660
So I mean it's like wow, it's when you're
talking about 3 billion and there was,

2440
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,480
there had been all thought there was
like 30 if you watch those shows,

2441
02:16:11,481 --> 02:16:14,340
it looks like there's like, well they,
they didn't mind it was going to say want.

2442
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:17,300
It's like 30 of them. Oh, right,
right. Oh that's what it looks like.

2443
02:16:17,360 --> 02:16:18,910
But they don't line up all 3 billion.

2444
02:16:18,920 --> 02:16:21,290
Think when you got a certain
sections and line up those sections.

2445
02:16:21,800 --> 02:16:23,840
And what happened was with
that, with the guy, that sample,

2446
02:16:23,841 --> 02:16:26,630
he brought in the shooter there,
there's like,

2447
02:16:26,631 --> 02:16:30,760
so there'd be strands like
with like 2.9 billion in there,

2448
02:16:30,761 --> 02:16:32,650
but the gap right here
in a gap right here,

2449
02:16:32,830 --> 02:16:35,970
but you could line up other DNA
samples and those gaps would fill in.

2450
02:16:35,971 --> 02:16:38,380
They'd all line up,
none of them are complete.

2451
02:16:38,381 --> 02:16:40,360
Then he brought on the first complete one.

2452
02:16:41,410 --> 02:16:45,280
So now they just have to go to the peer
review process and other people have to

2453
02:16:45,281 --> 02:16:47,060
find the same conclusions
that this woman is.

2454
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:50,770
What is the criticism about this woman?
Again, he never really got to that.

2455
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:53,650
I've never met her in person.

2456
02:16:53,651 --> 02:16:57,070
I don't want to bat an eye people that
I really respect and know that our smart

2457
02:16:57,071 --> 02:17:00,340
people, professionals are working
with her and really liked her.

2458
02:17:00,340 --> 02:17:04,190
And I've talked to other people that
are like, dude, she shady. Uh, so,

2459
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:09,080
so who knows, right? I don't know. I don't
know her personally. Now when does a,

2460
02:17:09,081 --> 02:17:10,030
the show,
uh,

2461
02:17:10,031 --> 02:17:14,320
when does a season two or season
three reason twos over season three?

2462
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:17,540
They just said sometime in the fall
products sweeps week or something.

2463
02:17:17,541 --> 02:17:19,240
They're gonna cause you're
still Aaron episodes.

2464
02:17:19,241 --> 02:17:23,420
I was still like show him and repeats, I
don't know. Popular show. Yeah it's real.

2465
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:24,360
Well right cause they,

2466
02:17:24,361 --> 02:17:28,250
it's like the second most popular and
animal planet history didn't say didn't uh

2467
02:17:28,270 --> 02:17:30,820
South Park parody guys.
Yeah fuckers.

2468
02:17:32,770 --> 02:17:36,850
Fuck cause we were all laughing like
wait we all love South Park and the

2469
02:17:36,851 --> 02:17:39,790
producers that we're going to show like
comedian stand up comedians and stuff

2470
02:17:39,791 --> 02:17:44,791
and like they love this show and
here's money maker and a box.

2471
02:17:45,301 --> 02:17:48,250
So we thought well we thought it was
going to be was because we saw that we saw

2472
02:17:48,251 --> 02:17:52,810
some little clip that came
out way earlier. Someone
got ahold of somehow of a,

2473
02:17:52,900 --> 02:17:54,790
it showed them like dressed up like ass,

2474
02:17:54,800 --> 02:17:58,630
like wearing backpacks and stuff and
we thought for sure they going to have

2475
02:17:59,050 --> 02:18:03,580
carbon played moneymaker cause he's like
carbon and make her like the same guy

2476
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:08,830
and that's pretty good.

2477
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:14,320
So then they made Clinton and Matt
like normal and then they made me this

2478
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:19,150
fucking short retard that is all scared.

2479
02:18:19,151 --> 02:18:21,790
Like it was the most, like they didn't
get it. I like this little short,

2480
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:25,450
retarded is scared.
Like I can't talk.

2481
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:29,500
They don't talk all that great, but
so they got you the worst. Oh Dude.

2482
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:33,940
I'm only guy. They slaughtered
video. Have you seen the episode?

2483
02:18:34,860 --> 02:18:38,980
I haven't seen it. Brian told me it's
awesome. It's a find a clip of it. I get,

2484
02:18:39,010 --> 02:18:40,720
I get Cartman.
Hi Dude.

2485
02:18:40,721 --> 02:18:44,020
We talked about the show on the podcast
so many times that people will yell at,

2486
02:18:44,070 --> 02:18:48,280
uh, during comedy shows. Have you
gone squatch in yet? Oh really? Yeah.

2487
02:18:48,281 --> 02:18:49,720
People you don't want it to,
it's very squashed

2488
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:52,480
area. Have you seen the
memes of, you were like,

2489
02:18:52,481 --> 02:18:55,570
it was like a meme is like
an internet photo that live,

2490
02:18:55,571 --> 02:18:58,180
they add a lel words too,

2491
02:18:58,181 --> 02:19:03,040
and then it gets passed on so many
times. You know, like a meme would be,

2492
02:19:03,041 --> 02:19:06,410
there's a photo of you or like, here's
a perfect example. You know, George,

2493
02:19:06,411 --> 02:19:10,030
Josue glows from ancient aliens.
There's a photo of him. It says,

2494
02:19:10,270 --> 02:19:13,840
I'm not saying it was aliens,
but it was aliens. It's like,

2495
02:19:13,990 --> 02:19:16,870
it's always one of those type things.

2496
02:19:17,330 --> 02:19:20,710
There's only one answer aliens
and it'd be the same photo,

2497
02:19:20,830 --> 02:19:22,790
but like with different texts.

2498
02:19:23,220 --> 02:19:27,070
But there's awesome ones of you
where it's like, that's a tree.

2499
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:28,450
This seems squashy

2500
02:19:29,590 --> 02:19:32,570
thank you. See if you can
find them. Brian there in the,

2501
02:19:32,571 --> 02:19:36,690
the Rogan board thread for this.
We were, I was thought squats.

2502
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:39,350
Pull one up if you can. I
would say squat. She laughed,

2503
02:19:39,351 --> 02:19:42,170
but I started saying it even more when
I found out it was a drinking game on

2504
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:45,950
college campuses because watch are shown
or told me to say squash or squash or

2505
02:19:45,951 --> 02:19:48,770
they drink. It's like, I ain't
going to kill somebody. That's it.

2506
02:19:48,771 --> 02:19:51,370
Like four times it, it's like you
can tell this places squatch it.

2507
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:54,260
You look around the squatch with k through
here and squashed over there and like,

2508
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:57,230
ah, just to try to give them
alcohol poisoning. Yeah.

2509
02:19:57,350 --> 02:20:00,590
It was a drinking game for the UFC.
If someone got rocked,

2510
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:03,800
I said he's rocked and people that drink,
there's a bunch of other things too.

2511
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:07,610
So if you play along at home, Oh, I'm
looking at this photo, this monkey,

2512
02:20:07,611 --> 02:20:12,440
this fake thing. It looks fake
as fuck. Dude, man, my aunt,

2513
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:16,070
my cousin Donnie says he
knows he's the little, uh,

2514
02:20:16,390 --> 02:20:20,240
Italian guy with a thick Boston accent
that worked with a Subaru dealer in Santa

2515
02:20:20,240 --> 02:20:24,410
Monica. Do you remember him? A
Subaru dealer in Santa Monica.

2516
02:20:24,470 --> 02:20:29,450
Did I look at a car there or something?
And he's salt. Never called me a Subaru,

2517
02:20:29,451 --> 02:20:31,580
so I don't know. He said he knew
or maybe it was from the playbook.

2518
02:20:31,610 --> 02:20:33,800
You ever go to the playboy mansion once?

2519
02:20:33,801 --> 02:20:37,160
I hosted the marijuana
policy project thing there.

2520
02:20:37,161 --> 02:20:40,760
So I was there once there was
a marijuana policy project,

2521
02:20:40,761 --> 02:20:44,390
had a thing at the mansion.
It was a,

2522
02:20:45,740 --> 02:20:49,460
it's like they rented out,
you know, so it's like,
everybody's like, wow. Oh right.

2523
02:20:49,461 --> 02:20:50,030
And they like,

2524
02:20:50,030 --> 02:20:53,000
they hired a couple chicks to go around
with like strippers that aren't even

2525
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:56,470
playbase, right? Fucking,
yeah, it's a sausage factory.
It's all done. It's right.

2526
02:20:56,690 --> 02:21:00,310
Whereas the girls, people, I know,
he's been up there finding the memes.

2527
02:21:01,350 --> 02:21:06,110
Take us out. This is how they
portrayed the big bigfoot field.

2528
02:21:06,111 --> 02:21:07,070
Researchers are going to see,

2529
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:10,570
would you stop scaring
everyone with your gun?

2530
02:21:11,460 --> 02:21:14,310
People Thought Atlantis was a
myth. Cow. But I was just there.

2531
02:21:14,490 --> 02:21:15,840
I explored the depth of Atlanta is,

2532
02:21:15,841 --> 02:21:19,110
and now that to prove a new species
exist on a little James Cameron,

2533
02:21:19,430 --> 02:21:22,080
they see black going to prove anything.
To believe any of this,

2534
02:21:22,081 --> 02:21:24,360
you either have to be a liar or stupid.

2535
02:21:24,540 --> 02:21:27,570
These are professional people who go
around tracking. SASQUATCH is cow.

2536
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:29,700
They aren't liars and they aren't stupid.

2537
02:21:30,510 --> 02:21:34,640
Look at its trajectory and head
directly to the right. Can't be human.

2538
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:38,910
It's too low to the ground. What do
you think Bobo? Bobo think scary.

2539
02:21:40,690 --> 02:21:44,770
I think in a Sasquatch it's not big
enough to be a squatch, so it's a baby.

2540
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:47,940
Squatch that's what I'm thinking.
I've already done my research boys.

2541
02:21:47,970 --> 02:21:51,030
What you're looking at there
is a Juba Cobra jump on camera.

2542
02:21:51,450 --> 02:21:54,240
It's like a Sasquatch, only
more elusive, more ferocious,

2543
02:21:54,241 --> 02:21:58,180
and a little more greening.
Oh, Jupa carbon. That's scary.

2544
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,580
If we rule out a human and
a baby, Sasquatch, Juba.

2545
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:05,220
Copper is all we really have left the man.
I guess that's it.

2546
02:22:05,250 --> 02:22:07,530
You're going to have to allow only
me and to the Easter egg hunts there.

2547
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:08,870
I'm the only one credit fed

2548
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:12,360
that one. That must be. That
must be awesome to have that.

2549
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:15,030
I mean that to me as a South Park Fan,
I would,

2550
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:19,440
I would faint and they fucking
parody dear show. Fucking retard.

2551
02:22:20,820 --> 02:22:24,320
Really. You though. It's
just a character real.

2552
02:22:24,321 --> 02:22:27,420
You has the big foot
community quite well today.

2553
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:31,260
Thanks very much for the and squash
and hat. This is pretty fucking dope.

2554
02:22:31,330 --> 02:22:34,170
If they did me, I would
be a gay cat. That's

2555
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:39,710
probably right stage that you think is
the good part though. Cause I got Cartman.

2556
02:22:39,750 --> 02:22:44,430
Hi, you've got Carmen. I turned
carbon into a Jew. Really?

2557
02:22:44,460 --> 02:22:48,870
Yeah. Wow. I'll check out the rest
of it. Go on South Park Studios.

2558
02:22:48,871 --> 02:22:52,490
They had all the episodes and the episode
is call it Jeeva, cholera or whatever.

2559
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,310
Do you pack a,
I'll just spell it out.

2560
02:22:56,311 --> 02:23:00,330
J. E. W. P. A. C. C. A. B. R. A.

2561
02:23:00,331 --> 02:23:04,170
It's seasoned 16 Jupa. Cobre. Yeah,
like a trooper cover, but a Jew.

2562
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:09,570
That's what I was thinking it was
God blessed South Park, the best man.

2563
02:23:09,610 --> 02:23:11,610
They're there, but no one's
consistently put out funny shit.

2564
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:15,730
Why they heckled fuck the heroin
like, well dude, look at your,

2565
02:23:15,731 --> 02:23:20,670
your fucking on a bigfoot show.
Money makers for all of them.

2566
02:23:20,671 --> 02:23:23,400
They all looked retarded.
That's what South Park does.

2567
02:23:23,401 --> 02:23:26,070
They went after you a little harder,
but come on man.

2568
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,310
It's an honor and you're
on a big food show, man.

2569
02:23:32,900 --> 02:23:36,000
That's really how they respect that.
Dot. They'd fucked up when big foot,

2570
02:23:36,001 --> 02:23:39,330
when you get something solid men,
then the tide will change.

2571
02:23:39,331 --> 02:23:40,140
You're going to come in,

2572
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:43,380
they're going to have a fucking float for
you in downtown La Cause it'd be a big

2573
02:23:43,381 --> 02:23:44,490
parade every right.

2574
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:48,540
We found a real big foot and
you and moneymaker and the,

2575
02:23:48,780 --> 02:23:51,420
and they could put all this
stuff back in the Renee saying,

2576
02:23:51,421 --> 02:23:54,460
I think it's squatch because then
we'll know. Now we know squashes.

2577
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:56,550
It isn't always that she did
that when we were in Oregon.

2578
02:23:56,730 --> 02:24:01,050
They should have left that
shit in authenticity there.
She says, she still says,

2579
02:24:01,051 --> 02:24:02,350
she goes, I don't know
what it was like, shit,

2580
02:24:02,351 --> 02:24:04,980
we got to get her on the podcast too.
I've got to find out what makes her tick.

2581
02:24:05,180 --> 02:24:09,800
Oh is a bad
dude.

2582
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:12,360
I think you guys have a good time.
What's wrong?

2583
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:16,320
Nothing sounds like she's poisoned.
Gets Sewn Joe. No you're not.

2584
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:22,470
I see what you're saying.
I would have a good time if I was a woman,

2585
02:24:23,410 --> 02:24:26,080
I scissors up. Good. She would
have a good time with me.

2586
02:24:26,140 --> 02:24:29,100
Your garrison would have a shot.
Well even if she wasn't gay,

2587
02:24:29,101 --> 02:24:31,610
hanging out with you guys in the
woods chasing weight, foot turning,

2588
02:24:31,620 --> 02:24:34,200
gay or lesbian

2589
02:24:34,660 --> 02:24:35,500
when the tooth,

2590
02:24:35,501 --> 02:24:40,360
this fucking tweaker tooth that they
can't run out to me with like four little

2591
02:24:40,361 --> 02:24:43,270
rug rats, like all licensed
vested kids like on it was like,

2592
02:24:43,420 --> 02:24:44,950
I think it was the first of the
month or something. You know,

2593
02:24:44,951 --> 02:24:46,390
they just got their checks right.

2594
02:24:46,420 --> 02:24:50,260
She was at like the canned food story
and identity can store like cheap stuff,

2595
02:24:50,261 --> 02:24:50,470
whatever.

2596
02:24:50,470 --> 02:24:53,900
I was walking by and Oh we're big fans
are big fans since you came to this like

2597
02:24:54,160 --> 02:24:57,580
just this looks like the Simpsons
evil baby like unibrow and all that,

2598
02:24:58,060 --> 02:25:01,300
like frowning and she hands you this
like kid, like two or three years old.

2599
02:25:01,301 --> 02:25:05,560
She's all take a picture of your kids.
Like am I, Hey. And I'm like, hey buddy,

2600
02:25:06,240 --> 02:25:06,791
how to Cameron?

2601
02:25:06,791 --> 02:25:10,390
He just looks at me and smile and he
just looks really wham and headbutted me

2602
02:25:10,391 --> 02:25:15,010
and knocked my tooth out.
A baby headbutted you like a toddler.

2603
02:25:16,030 --> 02:25:20,060
Whoa dude. I find that harder
to believe than bigfoot.

2604
02:25:20,580 --> 02:25:24,070
Well it was already. It was a, I
got hit the face of the surfboard

2605
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:27,740
there. Oh, is already loose.
Well it did cap. I went to,

2606
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:31,830
I went to Tijuana, dude, I
got this deal captain t on,

2607
02:25:31,840 --> 02:25:35,620
I got a bunch of dental market teal on
and really do. My dentist is off the hook.

2608
02:25:35,621 --> 02:25:38,080
He's like, this is crazy.
He wasn't crazy. He's like,

2609
02:25:38,530 --> 02:25:41,230
he's kind of the world's most interesting
man because if I got a short fat

2610
02:25:41,231 --> 02:25:46,231
Mexican boy Orbison like short fat banks
get Roy Orbison like the thick glasses.

2611
02:25:47,591 --> 02:25:51,780
He's funny. He just had a liver
transplant like six months. I was as a,

2612
02:25:52,210 --> 02:25:56,170
did you want to hear that? You got
a minute? Yeah, so I'm going down.

2613
02:25:56,171 --> 02:25:59,140
I was going to like this like legitimate
clinic down in Tj that people go to the

2614
02:25:59,141 --> 02:26:03,250
one next to the police station and uh,
cause like they want like 20 grand.

2615
02:26:03,251 --> 02:26:06,190
I'd been hit in the face with
crab blocks and surfboards and

2616
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:10,930
pool cue, stuff like that. And so
I'd always cracked teeth and stuff.

2617
02:26:10,931 --> 02:26:13,780
So I was gonna him all fixed.
They want like 23 grand and the states.

2618
02:26:14,290 --> 02:26:16,960
So I'm going down there and stop and
see my buddy's Mexican dude. He's all,

2619
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:21,400
oh my fee, my fiance's uncle is a
dentist and then he's got like, yeah,

2620
02:26:21,401 --> 02:26:24,240
it's a cheaper clinic. You know,
it's just like, like there's,

2621
02:26:24,700 --> 02:26:27,380
there wasn't even electricity when I
went there. Like the first day, you know,

2622
02:26:27,940 --> 02:26:31,240
he hadn't been practicing cause he'd got
a liver transplant, he's be a partier.

2623
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:34,350
And uh,
we go down there and like,

2624
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:37,240
we're doing all this work
and out of the second day,

2625
02:26:37,241 --> 02:26:40,510
I've been the chair for like eight hours.
He's like,

2626
02:26:40,511 --> 02:26:43,310
we got to go look at pretty good. He's
a total horn dog. He's like almost 70.

2627
02:26:43,311 --> 02:26:46,930
He's a little short, chubby guys hitting
on every girl. He's pretty cool. He's fun,

2628
02:26:46,931 --> 02:26:49,840
he's interesting and whatever. And he's
hitting on all these checks. He's like,

2629
02:26:50,110 --> 02:26:53,650
so he takes this giant strip are called
like the Hong Kong cafe or something.

2630
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,760
You ever heard of that? No, it's like
three stories. It's like one of those, uh,

2631
02:26:57,220 --> 02:26:59,260
it's like grindhouse or something.
You think when you want.

2632
02:26:59,261 --> 02:27:04,210
It's like full narco place. Like you
know, full inky Awana it's three stories.

2633
02:27:04,211 --> 02:27:05,860
It's got like big hot tub.

2634
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:10,090
Are you wearing a gone squatch and hat
while you're wandering around this place?

2635
02:27:10,330 --> 02:27:11,560
I don't know what I was wearing,

2636
02:27:11,561 --> 02:27:15,100
but I'm just probably just like I have
now I want to picture you in a garland

2637
02:27:15,101 --> 02:27:19,690
squash and hat. If I don't, if you
don't mind. And the dude, he disappears.

2638
02:27:19,691 --> 02:27:20,840
Like I didn't know that.

2639
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:24,640
I thought I apparently every girl in
there was like a hooker and you can just

2640
02:27:24,700 --> 02:27:28,150
get a girl, whatever and well he splits
and we're waiting and we had a plan.

2641
02:27:28,150 --> 02:27:29,740
If anyone got to separated for a reason,

2642
02:27:29,741 --> 02:27:32,230
we were going to meet at the truck back
at nine o'clock or whatever it was,

2643
02:27:32,231 --> 02:27:34,180
or eight or eight 30 we,
you know,

2644
02:27:34,181 --> 02:27:38,020
we'd meet at the truck was a couple
of blocks away. Well, you know,

2645
02:27:38,021 --> 02:27:40,240
it's eight 30 we don't see the guy.
They were at the place. We leave,

2646
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:45,310
we go back to the truck, he's not
there. Then we wait for like two hours.

2647
02:27:45,330 --> 02:27:47,980
My buddy's like in going
to school to be a nurse.

2648
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:50,410
So he had to get back head class
like seven years. Her Dude,

2649
02:27:50,411 --> 02:27:52,330
I can't wait for the guy all night. Fuck,
I don't know where he is. You know, he's,

2650
02:27:52,360 --> 02:27:54,730
he's Mexican. He speak Spanish,
you know, he's probably all right.

2651
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:57,520
But he just had a liver
transplant six months earlier.

2652
02:27:57,950 --> 02:28:01,120
He'd had a couple of Margarita,
so like we weren't Christ.

2653
02:28:01,180 --> 02:28:04,210
And so we go back to the states because
we were just going to cross the border

2654
02:28:04,211 --> 02:28:09,211
every day and he never comes home and the
family thinks I kidnapped and that I'm

2655
02:28:09,551 --> 02:28:11,920
part of a kidnapping because they
looked at me and thought like sketchy.

2656
02:28:12,430 --> 02:28:16,960
And so I'm getting accused of kidnapping
this old man. So he never came home? No.

2657
02:28:16,961 --> 02:28:20,380
So we're like, you know,
like I was starting to get
nervous and they were like,

2658
02:28:20,440 --> 02:28:23,480
it was what'd you do it and
be like accusing me like,
you know, over the phone.

2659
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:27,470
Oh Wow. And um, I was like,
oh, said, well I just got,

2660
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:29,150
and I was covering for the
guy, you know, go on. Like,

2661
02:28:29,151 --> 02:28:32,720
well I don't want to say all the guys
split with a hooker, you know, you know,

2662
02:28:32,721 --> 02:28:34,400
his wife's all upset.
I'm just like,

2663
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:37,280
I don't know where we were
in a Mexican restaurant.

2664
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:40,410
I wanted some barrage drinking out of
all those, you know, pain pills that day.

2665
02:28:40,411 --> 02:28:42,500
And I was getting just whatever,
like the shots and stuff.

2666
02:28:42,501 --> 02:28:44,690
I said I was kind of groggy and you know,

2667
02:28:44,691 --> 02:28:46,550
I just was walking around looking
for some brother and I came,

2668
02:28:46,580 --> 02:28:48,020
I didn't even know what,
what restaurant it was.

2669
02:28:48,021 --> 02:28:51,920
I walked for like four or five blocks, got
laws. So I totally covered for the guy.

2670
02:28:52,340 --> 02:28:55,400
The next day he shows up and he's like,
and the family's like,

2671
02:28:55,401 --> 02:28:58,070
where worry you don't know. I don't know
what story he told them, but you know,

2672
02:28:58,071 --> 02:29:00,260
you just said that I left
him in a restaurant luck.

2673
02:29:00,290 --> 02:29:02,390
He said something like that too.
That was close enough.

2674
02:29:03,170 --> 02:29:06,320
So he was so stuck that at this point
of were like he's not a very good,

2675
02:29:06,321 --> 02:29:07,430
he's a cool guy.
They go party with,

2676
02:29:07,431 --> 02:29:11,160
but he's not a very good dentist and at
this point he's not a very good dentist.

2677
02:29:11,170 --> 02:29:16,100
No. All he's all right. He's
wasn't terrible. But um, so he uh,

2678
02:29:16,670 --> 02:29:17,870
he goes,
he goes blah.

2679
02:29:17,890 --> 02:29:21,230
I thank you so much to all give you
half off the rest of your dental work.

2680
02:29:21,231 --> 02:29:23,100
Cause I was like, I'm not going to
get any more dental work for this guy.

2681
02:29:23,580 --> 02:29:28,100
I like half off. Fuck yeah. So that
let's say you said, well fuck it.

2682
02:29:28,101 --> 02:29:30,620
As long as it's cheap. Yeah. Oh Shit.

2683
02:29:31,740 --> 02:29:34,130
Fuck happened. What does that noise, Bro,

2684
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:40,970
my computer's going crazy.
What do you mean it's going crazy?

2685
02:29:43,450 --> 02:29:46,270
Shitty music of that.
Yeah. What is that music?

2686
02:29:46,810 --> 02:29:49,730
That's the universe telling us
to wrap this podcast up. Huh?

2687
02:29:50,020 --> 02:29:51,280
Let's just wrap this podcast up.

2688
02:29:52,560 --> 02:29:56,500
You sound Mexican dude. Sounds bad
ass. What the fuck are you playing?

2689
02:29:56,501 --> 02:30:00,880
Is that fake rage against the
machine? Turn the volume down, Bro.

2690
02:30:22,090 --> 02:30:22,923
Thank you very much.

2691
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:27,500
My whole life I've been
fascinated by big foot.
