1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,483
Ma'Am,

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,440
the Joe Rogan experience day.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,310
Joe Rogan podcast by all day

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,940
you introduced us

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,160
my,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,790
we are all balls of steel.

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,683
Bloody balls.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,090
Bloody balls of steel shut offs.

9
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:24,924
Duncan Trussell.

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,183
Oh,

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,040
the hardest deal is the
ball of steel hammer.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,350
Tom Crane and Lance Armstrong
could form a true at trio.

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,150
Oh my,

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:38,530
what's it called?

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:40,050
Korn ferry Avengers trio.

16
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:40,884
It's true.

17
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,050
I want to see a tree yet.

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,140
You know,

19
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,940
quartet sounds better than trio.

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,311
Trio.

21
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:48,870
Sounds like the next time we come in,

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,550
get to take one more.

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,740
So all the way the working title.

24
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:53,870
Yeah.

25
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,060
Uh,

26
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,893
what you going to do now?

27
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,873
What are you going to do now,

28
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,330
ladies and gentlemen on Twitter?

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,100
Now's your time to be heard,

30
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,200
right?

31
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,790
Ben and Suzanne or listening?

32
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,933
Yeah.

33
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,860
And judging you.

34
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:05,281
Just kidding.

35
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,510
We're not except you.

36
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,773
Oh,

37
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,710
coming down.

38
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,403
Okay.

39
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,123
Ah,

40
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,453
yeah.

41
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,223
Okay.

42
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:40,923
Si.

43
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,010
Si.

44
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,173
Very

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,613
wait,

46
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,900
you can't change him.

47
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,303
Okay.

48
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:31,973
Yay.

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,973
Yes.

50
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,450
Key.

51
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,240
The key

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,490
to the gay.

53
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,030
Yeah.

54
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,550
Yeah.

55
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,980
I'm staying here.

56
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:10,893
Ooh.

57
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,263
Wow.

58
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,263
Okay.

59
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,130
You can't change him.

60
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,813
Hmm.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,593
Mouth.

62
00:03:59,270 --> 00:03:59,810
Ooh,

63
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,643
baby.

64
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,010
Yeah.

65
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,653
Yeah.

66
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,023
Okay.

67
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,840
Yeah.

68
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,673
Okay.

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,193
Awesome.

70
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,430
I really liked that one.

71
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,563
That was great.

72
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:58,290
Cool.

73
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:58,680
Wow.

74
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,640
That's bad ass.
