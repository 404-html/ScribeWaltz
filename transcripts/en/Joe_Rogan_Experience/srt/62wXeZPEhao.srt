1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,880
Hello freaks,
the fuck's going on ladies and 

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:07,880
gentlemen,
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,730
podcast is brought to you by Luke 
Massetti.com.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,790
That again is.
That's not a dude,

5
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,830
by the way.
That'd be a cool name though.

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,720
My name's Lou lumosity.
That's a bad attitude.

7
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,150
Is that the Internet?
That helicopter?

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,560
No,
that's real life.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,230
That's a sound effect.
They're looking for you anymore.

10
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,860
Don't say not now.
I didn't say shit.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,710
Listen to Alex Jones.
Go after him.

12
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,530
Black helicopters problems and 
solutions.

13
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:43,980
Ladies and gentlemen,
lumosity is a website that's designed as

14
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:47,370
a gym for your dome as we sit here 
drinking miller.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,040
Highlife lumosity is,
um,

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,250
it's essentially what they've developed 
is games that increase your brain's 

17
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:01,950
capacity to do things.
And what do I mean by that?

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,360
It's like it gets your brain in shape 
and they don't come across as like being

19
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,890
work.
It comes across as,

20
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,060
as games.
It's really interesting and it's based 

21
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,310
on the science of it's called 
neuroplasticity.

22
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,350
That's the,
uh,

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
the idea behind it.
And there's a series of questions that 

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,630
they ask you when you sign up and when 
you,

25
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:21,900
uh,
you go to their website,

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,290
you click on get started now,
and then you start entering all sorts of

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,230
information.
Like what aspects of your memory are you

28
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:32,040
trying to train?
Like recalling the location of objects.

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,360
Can you not breathe?
Hold on.

30
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:33,760
What happened?

31
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,910
Oh,
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,950
The right into the microphone.
I'm sorry man.

33
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:43,560
I remember one makes you do things and 
not realize you're doing it.

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,950
Lumosity a has memory,
attention,

35
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:48,570
speed.
Like meaning,

36
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:50,970
the speed of,
of recognizing things,

37
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:53,490
coming up with answers for things,
flexibility,

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,010
communicating clearly and thinking 
outside the box.

39
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:58,120
And again,
all this shit is done in,

40
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,750
in games.
It's really interesting stuff.

41
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:02,250
I enjoy it.
It's fun.

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,820
It's fun to play.
That's ever been a guy that uh,

43
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:10,150
you know,
there's a bunch of 350 pound guys out 

44
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,460
there that you know,
that all of a sudden they're one 90.

45
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:16,461
They get in shape.
They have been to the last year with 

46
00:02:16,461 --> 00:02:16,710
Robert.
Robert Bradley was 350 pounds.

47
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,940
It's 190 pounds now.
He's amazing because he cut out soda and

48
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:25,941
he started training Jujitsu.
So with this luminosity thing that 

49
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:25,941
you've got,
what if,

50
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,810
what if,
what if you start like,

51
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,280
you know these dudes,
you know certain,

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,640
you know this guy joe or whatever is an 
idiot and all of a sudden he gets into 

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,730
these games and he's fucking 
intelligent.

54
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:38,580
He's like Graham Hancock and shit.
You think there'll be guys like that.

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,330
I think it's possible to increase your 
capacity slightly.

56
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,390
That's what I think.
I know how dumb I am,

57
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,220
so I know like when it comes to like,
have you ever talked to a mathematician?

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,320
A in sixth grade I've had conversations 
with mathematicians,

59
00:02:55,321 --> 00:03:00,321
just random guys that have met places 
and start talking to them about that 

60
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:00,321
fucking goodwill hunting

61
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:05,100
shit.
When they write on the chalkboard and 

62
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,430
all those weird fucked up.
I knew what it meant and Algebra because

63
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,400
Algebra was kind of easy to me and it 
was all that shit,

64
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,540
but I don't remember what it means now.
Well,

65
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,570
I think this is what it's like.
I think,

66
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,520
and I think this is where lumosity comes
into this,

67
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,270
is that when you do something a lot,
you get in shape for that thing and that

68
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,650
includes comedy.
You know,

69
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,480
I've been doing comedy for 23 years,
but dude,

70
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,150
if I tell you a couple of months off,
I get on shaky legs.

71
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,080
If I just try to go onstage flat,
I have to go over my material,

72
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:34,081
I have to listen to notes,
I have to listen to old recordings and 

73
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:37,261
get myself in the groove because my 
mind's not in comedy shape and that's 

74
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:37,261
what happens.

75
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:37,990
Like that happened to me when I was 
filming that show,

76
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,820
the Scifi show because I was doing it 
constantly.

77
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,770
I got out of comedy shape like I could 
feel it.

78
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:46,771
I could feel onstage.
I was awful little and I think that 

79
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:49,510
mathematics especially is one of those 
things that you get into and you build a

80
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,940
base,
you build a base and understanding of,

81
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,030
you know,
simple stuff like simple arithmetic,

82
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:57,270
simple subtraction.
Then you start dividing things.

83
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,290
Then you start getting into Algebra and 
equations in Calculus and you need that 

84
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:02,290
base.
You need like you to need,

85
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,200
got to be in shape.
You can't just get into a Jujitsu gym 

86
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,571
and roll with Eddie Bravo.
You gotta have some fucking training 

87
00:04:09,571 --> 00:04:12,301
behind you.
You've got to build your conditioning 

88
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:12,301
up.
You've got to get somewhere.

89
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:12,301
I think it's like that with everything 
you do,

90
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:17,281
man.
Do I remember I had a multiply numbers 

91
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:17,860
and Adam and subtract them and light 
them up.

92
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,690
Right?
But the division,

93
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:24,640
you know when you put them in a little 
345 divided into 17,000,

94
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:27,470
212,
like how the fuck do you do that?

95
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,820
You start over,
you start on the top of that house and 

96
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,140
where do the decimal points go out?
I don't know how to do that shit no 

97
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,140
more.
Yeah.

98
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,900
That's where it stops.
It's one of those things,

99
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,880
man.
Well you just gotTa do it all the time.

100
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:43,150
It's got to be a part of your life.
If it's not a part of your life,

101
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,530
it's too slippery with Jujitsu.
I think that's where the comedy.

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
I think that's the way with anything 
hard.

103
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,060
I think most people forget that shit 
like this division because I'm sure 

104
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,960
you'll probably fuck up yo,
I fuck up.

105
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,970
Simple point of is there.
Is it important to learn how to do it 

106
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,050
even though you're going to forget it is
does.

107
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,140
Is that just an exercise of the mind?
It's not the actual division process in 

108
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,040
and all that.
It's just you're,

109
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,690
you're young,
you're 12,

110
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:12,670
you're 13,
you're working out the mind.

111
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,550
We know they're going to forget it when 
they grow older,

112
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,560
but you need that workout.
Is it for that or are you supposed to 

113
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,681
remember how to do that?
I think when you take time off of 

114
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:22,681
things,
you just forget how to do them.

115
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:23,740
You know?
I went for a long period of time where I

116
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,970
didn't play pool.
You know?

117
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:26,740
I used to play pool eight,
10 hours a day.

118
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,970
When I lived in New York,
I was upset.

119
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,290
I wanted to be a professional pool 
player.

120
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:34,000
I was obsessed and then I took like 
years off and I started playing again in

121
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:39,001
like 2006 or something after I did a TV 
show and I was fucking terrible.

122
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:41,140
Dude,
I didn't know what I was doing.

123
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:45,250
I just lost all my information.
I get it all went away,

124
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,170
but I was playing eight,
10 hours a day.

125
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,670
Man,
I was pretty decent.

126
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:53,020
I was a decent like b player and then I 
just was Tara f player.

127
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:55,300
As soon as I came back I was like,
where did it all go?

128
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,890
Why did I forget how to do everything?
Methods,

129
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,130
the

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,240
methods of science thing right up,
right up on may have math.

131
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,710
Math to me is a.
it's a science.

132
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,880
It's very complex like I think you're 
born with it.

133
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,260
It's a.
it's a serious set of skills that you 

134
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:10,260
have to constantly keep working on it if
you're going to perfect it.

135
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,680
One thing about mathematicians,
they never argued with each other and 

136
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:14,680
they're not,
oh no,

137
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:14,680
this is.
This is going to happen.

138
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,730
To be mathematicians are just like,
boom,

139
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,250
it's right on the table.
You can't argue the math is correct.

140
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,500
All this is going to do is look at it 
and you'd be like,

141
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,490
Oh man,
that's correct.

142
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,780
The same thing with this lumosity,
which is so crazy because to me that's 

143
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,271
like science,
science is basically telling you to put 

144
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:31,271
your life,
your brain,

145
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:31,271
your neurological patterns,
your thoughts,

146
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,610
everything on a computer and I think 
scientists are able to study that like 

147
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:40,481
what do most people like,
what are they going to do this and 

148
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:42,431
they're going to start putting it into 
categories because there's these 

149
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,031
scientists out there right now that are 
basically learning how to control 

150
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:48,101
computers through through one's brain 
and they think that your brain is going 

151
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:48,101
to be a part of the computer one day for
sure,

152
00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:50,840
and it's all going to be that that 
computer is actually going to be you.

153
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,020
And I think with this,
lumosity is a huge step in that era,

154
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,430
which is like a science.
It's a math,

155
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:57,800
I think it says building on computers or
the next.

156
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,250
You can't deny him.
You know,

157
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,270
we've grown so much through,
through computers in this and this 

158
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,270
history.
It's only gonna get more advanced.

159
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,090
It's going to get a lot more technical 
and a lot more bizarre.

160
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Yeah.
And the idea of designing programs that 

161
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,841
and he enhanced your brain the same way 
you would design something that would 

162
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:13,810
work out a computer.
I think you have a real good point about

163
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:16,480
mathematicians to because they don't 
argue about shit.

164
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,810
It's pretty pretty black and white if 
you can understand the math,

165
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,230
but it gets so squirrely that some guys 
can't even understand the math.

166
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Like it gets to this weird super complex
area like where they have these million 

167
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,861
dollar prizes to solve problems.
Like there was this one crazy Russian 

168
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:34,750
cat that apparently he wanted but didn't
want the money to remember that shit.

169
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:40,050
That story.
Some Russian dude is solve this long 

170
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,010
term mathematical problem and he didn't 
even want the money.

171
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,220
It was like a million dollar prize or 
something ridiculous behind it.

172
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,430
But he was just obsessed with solving 
these complex riddles of numbers and he 

173
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,330
lived in that world,
the world of numbers.

174
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,000
How crazy is that?
That that is the pinnacle of,

175
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:02,060
of intellect.
We don't know shit about it.

176
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:05,520
I don't know what the fuck.
And that's like.

177
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,320
It's almost like it's almost to fully 
understand.

178
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,700
No one knows exactly what we're about 
and how the fuck we're why we're here,

179
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:18,701
but it's going to have something to do 
with them damn numbers that they're 

180
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:18,701
working on.
Right.

181
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,660
It's like the meaning of the universe 
has something,

182
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,990
there's a connection and they're,
they're closer to figuring it out than 

183
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:25,990
we are.
You know,

184
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,470
that's what life's about is really 
connected,

185
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,630
you know,
as far as connecting to punch,

186
00:08:29,631 --> 00:08:31,110
connecting to triangle,
the whole world,

187
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,180
not connecting the dots.
And math is the true science to it 

188
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,000
because most people can't understand it.
So automatically like,

189
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,880
oh,
this guy's crazy.

190
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,770
So basically none of us in this room are
involved.

191
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:44,771
The true science of life.
We're just fucking shitting ourselves 

192
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:44,771
and jerking off.

193
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:44,771
Yeah,
yeah.

194
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:46,860
When you look at people,
people,

195
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,020
reproduction is very,
very key to our species out there that 

196
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,000
could look at science though.
They see the signs and they still,

197
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,370
they still wrote they're smart as hell.

198
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,380
They'd,
they look at the science and they still 

199
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,430
don't see it,
but if it was put in this put in math,

200
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:05,130
like you put it in numbers,
you have to accept it.

201
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,560
Right?
Except the numbers,

202
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,510
all that shit,
but you know,

203
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,620
they'll,
they'll check to see if your theory's 

204
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:14,620
Ryan.
If it isn't,

205
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:14,620
it basically becomes like a law of 
gravity.

206
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,920
It's set in stone.
There's no arguing with it.

207
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,370
It's a,
it's a law.

208
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,680
If you throw something up in the air,
it's going to fall down and he's like,

209
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,840
so no bias in that.
You know,

210
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,660
in math there's no bias.
Interesting

211
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,380
point,
man.

212
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,660
You know,
and I want to get to this on the podcast

213
00:09:28,661 --> 00:09:33,661
later when we're talking,
we're going to talk about some numbers 

214
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:33,661
and some,
some,

215
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:33,910
some different things over this weekend.
Anyway,

216
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:36,400
go to lumosity.com.
Use the code named Rogan.

217
00:09:36,401 --> 00:09:40,360
Let them know that I sent you in the 
referral box and click start training.

218
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:42,370
Create your own program.
You could try it out.

219
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,450
It's a really,
really fascinating website.

220
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:50,260
I think it's a beautiful design.
I love the idea behind it and I love the

221
00:09:50,261 --> 00:09:52,700
idea that you can do something like 
this,

222
00:09:52,701 --> 00:09:55,390
that you can create a fucking gym for 
your brain.

223
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,790
It's awesome.
They owe you triple for this commercial.

224
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,460
This was 35 minutes.
Yeah,

225
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,470
but these commercials are entertaining.
That's the whole key behind it and we 

226
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,470
need more of those.
Joe,

227
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,350
like the way you used to do it,
you're just blazing through them in two 

228
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:09,370
minutes.
Sometimes 30 minutes.

229
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:10,860
That is true.
Sometimes I do.

230
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,040
They're going to expect it,
man.

231
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,210
You better slow down.
Damn,

232
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,230
you're right.
Dammit.

233
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:15,810
Eddie Bravo wife freaking me out,
man.

234
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,820
He had the Darth vader of I'm going to 
give you commercials and they're going 

235
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,260
to give you material to try to say this,
this dot.

236
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,530
Oh really?
Yeah,

237
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,440
he jokes.
I shipped a lumosity.

238
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,120
Got Go there.
It's the shit.

239
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,150
You'll love it.
Uh,

240
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,840
we're also brought to you by 
squarespace.com.

241
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,010
Squarespace is

242
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,440
a new website that is designed to make 
websites.

243
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,100
It's fucking awesome.
I'm a huge fan of this thing.

244
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,380
Everybody that we've turned on two 
squares

245
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,650
base has,
has really enjoyed it.

246
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,320
Like my space.
Right?

247
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,150
Sorry,
it was adjusting something.

248
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,390
You are retarded.
No.

249
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,580
My space.
You pretty much used to build your own 

250
00:10:59,580 --> 00:10:59,580
website,
right?

251
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,720
This is way better.
This is not going to crash and I don't 

252
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,100
think you use glitter tags.
You can set up a store on this,

253
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,900
there's no comments.
You can use it on iphone,

254
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,030
android,
anyone

255
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,590
thing it's pretty bad ass and there's 
going to be,

256
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,640
we're going to do some sort of a 
contest.

257
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,850
And the winner,
whoever creates the coolest website is 

258
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,850
going to get,
um,

259
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,660
free squarespace with,
for a year or something like that.

260
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,580
Right?
It's free service for a year.

261
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,160
Um,
I'll let you know exactly what the,

262
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,720
uh,
what the contest is going to be,

263
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,780
but I'm expecting some pretty cool 
websites because it's pretty easy to use

264
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,540
a dope like myself can use it.
It's simple.

265
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,690
And if you go and use the offer code Joe
and the number 11 because we're in the 

266
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,430
month of November,
you can get 10 percent off your first 

267
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,430
purchase on.

268
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:43,670
That's what's so funny.
What happened,

269
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,870
what happened?
It keeps on bringing that mix.

270
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,800
I keep turning it.
Eddie Bravo.

271
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:52,850
So your trend is doesn't have carved out
like a sleep apnea.

272
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,990
Mild a mild case.
It's snowing like a motherfucker man.

273
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,940
Me chills,
you know,

274
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,480
when my wife takes me,
she goes,

275
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:02,980
look,
this was the last night,

276
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:03,610
and I'm like,
Shit.

277
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,320
You know what a big part of that 
memorable.

278
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,860
It's your nose and it's also your neck 
grapplers get it.

279
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,140
A lot of sleep because neck is too big.
Dude,

280
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,730
I'm all over the fucking place.
I said,

281
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,980
do you sleep on your side?
I'm here.

282
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,730
I'm like,
I'm violently wrestling with myself.

283
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:20,680
I'm putting myself in the lockdown and 
shit.

284
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,920
When I sleep I,
I wake up five times a day or night and 

285
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,450
then I piss a couple of times a night.
I'm all over the fucking place,

286
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:29,850
man.
I never get A.

287
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,150
Anyway,
make a website on that.

288
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,520
Eddie Bravo.
Sleep patterns.com.

289
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,640
It just every night go man.
Tonight wasn't motherfucker.

290
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:41,350
That actually might be a cool video 
series.

291
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,430
Like every day you wake up and talk 
about your fucking sleep and Gopro.

292
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,750
The snoring.
I haven't elapsed time.

293
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,400
Elaborate.
Just fucking all over the place.

294
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,570
You can go to squarespace,
Eddie Bravo,

295
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,420
and you could make this website and you 
can sell stuff.

296
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,840
You can set up an ecommerce site and it 
works for musicians to.

297
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,930
This is a thing about squarespace.
You can easily sell music,

298
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:04,030
so it is right up your alley.
Digital downloads,

299
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,400
soundcloud,
man,

300
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,930
that's the shit like soundcloud.
Soundcloud is the best workout.

301
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,370
You got to get on that sound cloud,
get the free music,

302
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,890
every art.
It just seems like most artists,

303
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,820
even though they're signed,
they'll have their little soundcloud and

304
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:21,280
put their own remixes and shit on that.
I mean,

305
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,400
it's all free.
So go ahead.

307
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I'm sorry.
You're going to apologize for musicians 

308
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,750
who want to sell music.
I guess it's pretty fucking hard to sell

309
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,940
music score days,
right?

310
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,090
Give it away.
That's a fascinating turn of events,

311
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,160

That's o n n I t if you haven't been 
there for a.

326
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,770
We got a lot of new shit including 
Zombie kettlebells.

327
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,890
That will scare the fuck out of you 
while you're training.

328
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,210
You want to train for the Zombie 
Apocalypse?

329
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,060
No better way than swinging around a 72 
pounds.

330
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,670
Zombie head.
You will get some serious shapes on,

331
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,350
especially if you double up on those 
bitches.

332
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,310
Put Hair on him.
No,

333
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,320
no hair yet.
That's Eddie Bravo that it looks like 

334
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:45,160
you're swinging around the capitated 
head.

335
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,560
I could think of no better way to kappa 
bells.

336
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,220
I can think of no better way to prepare 
for the apocalypse than to 72

337
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,680
pounds Zombie kettlebells sign.
You'd be ready.

338
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,360
You just gotta you gotTa.
Do what that do.

339
00:14:56,361 --> 00:15:01,361
That extreme kettlebell cardio workout 
series from Keith Weber do it with two 

340
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,070
72 pounders.
No one can fuck with you though.

341
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,190
The zombies.
You just be cutting the heads off and 

342
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,190
run into safety over and over again.
So these are real.

343
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,340
They're real.

344
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,340
Put that on your squarespace.
Set.

345
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Your website and Pravo.
They're making a prequel to face that 

346
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,400
facebook movie.
No,

347
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,250
I didn't know about my space.
Is it?

348
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,740
That seems like a show.
Justin timberlake.

349
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,460
Episode one.
They got to go back to friendster.

350
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,900
Friendster,
and then it turned.

351
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,370
Then everyone you ask friends during the
Ngo space was on live journal.

352
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,580
Remember that?
They should really.

353
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:39,581
I don't remember that at all.
They should really fuck with us and use 

354
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:39,581
the exact same actors that they use in 
the.

355
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:41,420
In the facebook commercial and don't say
shit about it.

356
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,300
The facebook movie use the exact same 
actress.

357
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,080
Everyone who was in that facebook movie 
now in the space,

358
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,100
but we let you know how fucking stupid 
we think it has a bad ending.

359
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,200
The My might is when everyone started 
abandoning ship going to facebook.

360
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,370
It's still up,
man.

361
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,710
I tried to delete my account several 
times,

362
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,300
fucking didn't work.
Anyway,

363
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:08,680
go to [inaudible]

364
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,250
dot com,
check out any of our supplements,

365
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,640
use the code name Brogan and save 10 
percent off any and all the supplements,

366
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,530
all the supplements we sell,
whether it's shroom,

367
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:17,190
tech,
sport,

368
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:22,191
which is the best if you want to talk 
about a workout pre workout thing to 

369
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:27,171
take.
The best thing I've ever tried ever for 

370
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:27,660
enhancing your endurance is shroom Tech 
Sport Shit.

371
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,750
It's cordyceps mushrooms and be 12.
And uh,

372
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,490
there's a couple other ingredients in 
there as well.

373
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,040
But the idea behind it is that cordyceps
mushrooms,

374
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,110
they found that these high altitude 
herding cattle people notice that their,

375
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,530
their cows were eating these mushrooms 
and they were like more active.

376
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,980
So they started taking them and people 
start using them.

377
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,990
China used him in the Olympics and they 
got a bunch of gold medals with them in 

378
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,260
1993.
The Beijing Summer Games,

379
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,150
uh,
the Chinese,

380
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,860
uh,
women's team was using,

381
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:56,340
uh,
they,

382
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,080
they figured out how to use these core 
steps.

383
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:03,081
Mushrooms to run marathons says they 
were running and impossible marathon 

384
00:17:03,751 --> 00:17:06,930
every day in preparation.
Several world records later,

385
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:11,931
the rumor was confirmed,
rumor doping test came up negative and 

386
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:16,110
it was revealed that the secrets was 
court has steps send Nessus sinensis,

387
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,430
sinensis,
s I n e n s science.

388
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,100
How would you say that?

389
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:25,470
How many fucking words are there online 
that you know what they are when you 

390
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,291
read them,
but you see you have no idea to say 

391
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,881
that.
A different story because that story 

392
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,551
isn't true story because how are you 
going to check on the Chinese fucking 

393
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,730
swim team or something?
Yeah,

394
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,240
you could just make up some shit easily.
You could go online and find that pretty

395
00:17:37,241 --> 00:17:39,370
quick.
These supplements are the real deal.

396
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:42,970
I think man behind this quarter

397
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,200
mushroom,
it improves oxygen utilization and the 

398
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,930
ATP production.
Two critical aspects of endurance,

399
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,580
the endurance athlete.
So it's,

400
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,460
it's,
it's a fantastic workout.

401
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,540
Top of it.
Makes Sense.

402
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,170
I could just like weed.
Weed is good in so many different ways.

403
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,630
It with nutrition and everything,
doesn't mushrooms,

404
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:03,840
you know,
they definitely put you in touch with,

405
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
uh,
the other dimensions that are all on 

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,000
you.
So yeah,

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,000
some of them will kill the fuck out of 
here.

408
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,820
You gotta be careful,
but it makes sense.

409
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,900
It makes sense that it does other shit 
like physical benefits.

410
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,410
That makes total sense.
Totally does.

411
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,420
Anyway.
No one's trying to rip you off.

412
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,950
This is all the best shit that we could 
find.

413
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,040
We sell everything that we use and we 
have a very fair policy on supplements.

414
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,850
A 30 pill,
90 day money back guarantee.

415
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:29,820
You don't even have to return it.

416
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,200
Just say,
I tried this shit.

417
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:33,180
I didn't feel anything.
You don't.

418
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,260
Okay,
you're fine.

419
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:34,850
You're good.
You,

420
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:40,060
you don't have to send anything in.
You get your money back because all 

421
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,191
we're doing is trying to turn you onto 
some shit that we use ourselves and I 

422
00:18:43,191 --> 00:18:45,050
find benefit in it.
And I think that if you try it,

423
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,060
you're going to enjoy it.
You're going to find benefit in it and 

424
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,190
you're going to realize why it costs,
what it costs,

425
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:53,550
what's involved in producing it.
What we're trying to do,

426
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,580
give you the highest level ingredients 
available and do it like in a suit in 

427
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,240
the most ethical way possible.
That's what we're trying to do.

428
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,220
Yeah,
for sure.

429
00:19:01,221 --> 00:19:02,270
If you,
if you fill it,

430
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,410
you know it's real,
you know,

431
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,820
fill your performance,
peak up,

432
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,740
you'll feel you'll feel a lot more 
healthier,

433
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:11,741
you know,
like more older you get and the more 

434
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:11,741
better you feel you're going to start 
filling a lot younger I think.

435
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,520
I think it does a lot of great things 
for your men mentally,

436
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,090
mind,
body,

437
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:14,780
soul,
Spirit,

438
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,620
everything,
man.

439
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,660
There's a bunch of shit you can do out 
there to benefit yourself and that's 

440
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,120
what ana is all about.
It's a human optimization website.

441
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,150
We're trying to just find shit that puts
you in the best mood.

442
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:31,151
Like there's a supplement called five 
htp and it helps your brain actually 

443
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:32,570
produce chemicals that make you feel 
better.

444
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,560
And serotonin development.
It's all from people been,

445
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,050
you know,
they've had these,

446
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,180
these drugs to enhance serotonin and 
development for a long time and Ssri for

447
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:49,181
people who have depression issues or 
five htp is a natural way to do that and

448
00:19:49,251 --> 00:19:54,251
that's one of the supplements that we 
sell it on and it's called new mood and 

449
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:57,551
inside of new mood is five htp and also 
trip to fan which converts to five htp 

450
00:19:57,551 --> 00:20:02,531
in your body.
The idea and being that it'll give you 

451
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:02,531
more of a time release effect.

452
00:20:02,531 --> 00:20:04,770
Um,
as far as what's controversial now,

453
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,790
I've never had one person say that new 
mood didn't have an effect on them.

454
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,791
And I've never heard one person say that
shroom tech sport hasn't had an effect 

455
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:16,811
on a positive both,
but there have people that said Alpha 

456
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:17,090
brain didn't do shit for them.
And I don't know what that's about.

457
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,180
I don't know how.
I mean some people they work together.

458
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,950
Yeah.
The mood and the Alpha brain.

459
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,500
Some people maybe they're not as 
sensitive as to what affects their brand

460
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,680
or doesn't affect their brain.
Maybe it didn't work on them.

461
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:32,681
Maybe they already have like a,
a high level of nutrients in their 

462
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:32,681
system.
It didn't need a bump.

463
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:35,240
I know too many people took too much 
night that nighttime night,

464
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,520
bunch of other shit.

465
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,670
Just give me the most crazy,
elusive wild dreams ever.

466
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,580
Amazing,
amazing dreams that I use.

467
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:44,870
This.
I'll take it to three times a day.

468
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:48,070
I'll use the Alpha brain.
I'll use the shroom tech ran and when

469
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,190
I go to sleep like sometimes like I 
don't,

470
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:51,910
I don't go to sleep for awhile,
but when I sleep,

471
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,470
man I'm,
I'm out for the whole night.

472
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:55,090
I'm not getting up,
going to the bathroom.

473
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:59,440
I wake up in the morning just just like 
sunshine in like it's great.

474
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:01,030
Every day is from knew.
Mood.

475
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,580
Knew mood in a alpha.
Beta.

476
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,730
Use them together.
Man.

477
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,200
I,
I sleep so good.

478
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:07,510
It's not like when you wake up,
you feel like groggy.

479
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:09,100
Maybe you guys took Nyquil.
When you're sick,

480
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,120
you wake up.
You're like,

481
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:11,520
oh my God.
Yeah.

482
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,360
Do you take this?
You wake up.

483
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:13,810
You're like,
man,

484
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:15,220
how you doing baby?
You feeling good?

485
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:20,221
Ready to get after it.
Like you just automatically in the zone 

486
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:20,221
as soon as you wake up,
you know how to get that night.

487
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,630
The practices early,
I think.

488
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,900
No,
I do have new mood,

489
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,180
but you know,
I,

490
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:29,310
I would take it every now and then after
a late night podcasts and I'm all wound 

491
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,070
up and I need to get some sleep.
I use it like to try to call it.

492
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,230
Well,
people who were into lucid dreaming,

493
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,290
they've been using Alpha brain people 
who there's like a whole,

494
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,380
you know,
how people were into Jujitsu because 

495
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,380
people were into Lucy.

496
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:42,380
I try to get it for a while.
I never tried it.

497
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,220
I got to work twice for me.
Railing.

498
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Hell yeah.
There's all these different techniques 

499
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,740
out there and lucid dreaming.
There's a lot of people who think lucid 

500
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,660
dreaming is like dreams that uh,
everything is crystal clear.

501
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,340
And so it's like,
so like it affects them.

502
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:01,830
It's not really that lucid dream is 
knowing that you're inside a dream,

503
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,870
recognizing that it's a dream and then 
having the power to control everything.

504
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,240
The first two steps of the levels of 
dreaming,

505
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:09,870
I think.
Right?

506
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,790
Like when you're your mind still half 
awake,

507
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,220
it's when you realize you're dreaming,
you know you're in a dream and you know 

508
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,020
you're sleeping and this is a dream and 
you can control everything.

509
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,470
Then when you wake up,
you can look it up in a blood only that 

510
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:25,470
you could fly.
You could do anything you want.

511
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,900
You are on the Matrix.
As soon as you recognize you're in a 

512
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:30,900
dream,
you right.

513
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,700
You have to recognize that you have the 
power to do whatever you want.

514
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,760
The only time I ever had a lucid dream 
happen because of something I did was 

515
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,190
something I saw in a movie where a guy 
was saying,

516
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,610
when you go through a door,
you should knock on the door and say,

517
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,560
am I dreaming?
And do it every day.

518
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,260
When you go through doors,
like whenever you go through door knock,

519
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:47,140
knock,
am I dreaming?

520
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,740
So that becomes like a habit when you go
through doors.

521
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,570
So when you go through a door and your 
dream.

522
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:56,571
I did this for awhile.
Then I went through a door and my dream 

523
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:56,571
and I went,
Oh shit,

524
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:56,850
I'm dreaming.
I was like,

525
00:22:56,851 --> 00:22:58,790
there's no door here,
and then I realized I was dreaming.

526
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:01,320
I remember this.
Normally when I know that I'm dreaming,

527
00:23:01,321 --> 00:23:04,020
I'll just wake right the fuck up.
I normally can't hang onto it.

528
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:06,990
I always described dreams as being like 
a really gentle bubble,

529
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,110
like a kids bubble where they blow 
bubbles is a barely hold it in your 

530
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,960
hand,
but dreaming on Nootropics,

531
00:23:12,961 --> 00:23:16,650
whether it's Alpha brain or neuro one or
new boot or any of these.

532
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,330
I get these weird like rubber dreams,
like you can bounce them around and move

533
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:23,220
them.
They're durable bubbles.

534
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,470
I slept with dvds.
I got into [inaudible].

535
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,930
There's people that are really good at 
it.

536
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:30,980
There's guys that could do it every 
night that masters and they look forward

537
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:34,940
to dreaming while I was into this for 
like maybe six months.

538
00:23:34,941 --> 00:23:39,941
I got into it.
I got a couple of dvds and you sleep 

539
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:42,101
with these dvds and they keep it.
They keep waking you up like every 

540
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,170
couple minutes ago,
wake up and then it actually does you 

541
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,471
up,
and then you go back to sleep and you 

542
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:50,960
get used to just sleeping through the 
white cups.

543
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,550
And then as soon as,
I don't remember exactly how it all goes

544
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:58,190
down,
but it's really,

545
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:03,191
really hard because you've got to keep 
reminding yourself you've got to keep 

546
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:03,191
thinking of a,
a,

547
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,910
a certain place and then you can do all 
that other stuff where you knock on it 

548
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,660
every time we walked through a door,
you asked herself on my dreaming in your

549
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,460
everyday life.
But that becomes really hard.

550
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,110
Like you forget,
you get lazy,

551
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,220
you don't want to do it.
So it's hard.

552
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,240
So I was able to do it twice a with 
these dvds.

553
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,900
There's all these instructions and they 
talk to you and they try to wake you up.

554
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,380
And it worked out of maybe 40 times that
I went to bed doing these exercises,

555
00:24:27,031 --> 00:24:29,860
these mental drills.
Uh,

556
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,090
it worked twice and it was pretty 
awesome,

557
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:32,520
man.
And then,

558
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,130
and the two things that everyone does 
and you can do with breathing,

559
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,620
the [inaudible] you have fight or 
flight,

560
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:43,621
so when you're all fight or flight,
so you get home from a late night work 

561
00:24:43,621 --> 00:24:46,291
out or you just beasts in the Joe Rogan 
on it kettlebells feeling like a beast 

562
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,650
and you're at night,
you could be tired,

563
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:50,120
but your body's still reacting to the 
fight or flight mode.

564
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,090
We just did this workout.
What are we going to do next?

565
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,380
And if you actually take time and you 
slow down your breathing,

566
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,430
you tell your,
uh,

567
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,170
your nervous system to,
to slow down.

568
00:24:59,171 --> 00:25:00,100
Okay?
It's time to relax,

569
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:01,690
which actually releases natural 
hormones,

570
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:04,040
which I'm sure you're capable of.
But in,

571
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,230
in dreams I've had dreams on,
on these type of supplements where I 

572
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,440
felt like I could literally push off the
ground and I was flying in the air and I

573
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:13,030
was like,
I kept telling myself when I woke up,

574
00:25:13,031 --> 00:25:13,390
I'm like,
man,

575
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:14,080
I got to remember that.

576
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,910
So I tell myself,
almost like you're knock on the door.

577
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,610
Remember that?
And I was,

578
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,980
I was transforming in these dreams.
Like I'd fly here and then I would go 

579
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:23,980
somewhere else and when I remember that 
I looked it up and it was like,

580
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,710
you're in control of your life.
Like you can control your destiny.

581
00:25:26,711 --> 00:25:29,480
Right now it's like all about.
So sometimes I'd have like some good,

582
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:32,470
like positive results and then like 
sometimes it's like a,

583
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:37,500
you got bit by something and then you 
gotta like look it up and it's just 

584
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,500
like,
oh,

585
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,500
you're just going through a rough one 
right now.

586
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,870
And you're like,
we have no doubt.

587
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:40,750
Right?
So have interpretations.

588
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,280
They have interpretation.
Know what the.

589
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,770
I think they're guessing like a mother.
It's insane.

590
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:46,900
No way dude.
Grab,

591
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,930
grab a book of a,
of a dream book from anywhere and just 

592
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,240
just try to tell yourself to either 
knock on the door,

593
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:57,241
remember this dream,
wake up and either you can even Google 

594
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:58,150
this dream interpretations and you can 
really look up your dreams.

595
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,770
Some of them are like a little bit off 
the ball,

596
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:00,910
but some of them you're like,
wow.

597
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:05,911
I mean,
I've had more than on both hands of 

598
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:06,430
dreams that I can remember were like I 
looked it up and it like maybe something

599
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,860
hit while you're talking about knowing 
that you're in a dream,

600
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,830
dream,
dream,

601
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,790
and then he finds the interpretation.
What does it mean

602
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,880
in the dream going,
fuck,

603
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:17,690
I'm in a dream.
I can.

604
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Once people realize their dreams,
the two most common things that they do 

605
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,590
fly.
Everyone flies right away and have sex 

606
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:26,590
immediately.
Like,

607
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,220
Oh shit,
you and the two times I did it,

608
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,730
I remember when the first time this DVD 
worked,

609
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,140
I thought,
oh my God,

610
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:33,800
I'm dreaming.

611
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,910
Let's get to the podcast.
We're going to end this commercial.

612
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,430
This is a commercial.
Use a code name.

613
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,030
Rogan save 10 percent off finding this 
up,

614
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:41,860
and I said,
Tom,

615
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,780
o n n and it will talk about this,
right?

616
00:26:43,781 --> 00:26:44,050
I,
we'll

617
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:46,200
just go right into it because I don't 
want people to mess us.

618
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:46,980
Hit it.

619
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:56,320
Joe Rogan experience podcast

620
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,120
commercial.
It was just too good.

621
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:06,190
I had A.
I had to stop and just make the podcast 

622
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,381
live because on Sirius satellite radio,
none of that other stuff will go on 

623
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:09,410
because it's all the commercials,
but talking about we were talking.

624
00:27:09,411 --> 00:27:14,411
I'm here with Jeremy Stevens,
little heathen in the house and the 

625
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:14,411
Great Eddie Bravo,
my brother.

626
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:15,410
Thank you for.
And we're uh,

627
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,970
we're going to talk about the UFC for 
sure.

628
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,670
But right now we were talking about 
lucid dreaming and Eddie was bringing up

629
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,650
the fact that you can,
you can,

630
00:27:21,651 --> 00:27:24,680
if you study like methods,
there's books that they have.

631
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:29,681
There's exercises you can do where you 
can try to figure out how to get 

632
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,430
yourself in a state where you can have a
lucid dream.

633
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:32,320
And you did it a couple times.

634
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,640
And again,
lucid dreams.

635
00:27:33,641 --> 00:27:36,220
A lot of people think lucid dreams are 
crystal clear dreams.

636
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,460
Lucid dreaming is when you know you are 
dreaming.

637
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,950
Not a crystal clear,
profound dream.

638
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,960
It's when you figure out you're 
dreaming,

639
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,830
you can control everything.
Everything becomes super clear.

640
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,390
Like all.
Once I figured it out,

641
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,450
I was dreaming it and it worked.
All these,

642
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:56,550
these,
this DVD talks to you while you're 

643
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,411
sleeping and then it wakes you up.
He's trying to wake you up in your 

644
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:58,411
dream.
You're dreaming,

645
00:27:58,411 --> 00:27:58,411
wake up,
you're dreaming,

646
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,620
you're dreaming.
Wake up,

647
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,080
control this DVD.
You're saying that,

648
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,720
so you go to sleep with this.
Is that what you're doing?

649
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,610
There's all these mental exercises you 
do.

650
00:28:06,611 --> 00:28:09,280
You have to think of a.
you're on an island with,

651
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,310
you know,
think about the person you want to dream

652
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:14,400
with and all that.
There's really hard.

653
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,370
It's easier just to go to fucking sleep.
What if you got to,

654
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,320
if it's a five DVD series,
you got to like DVD number five and it's

655
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:26,321
like,
and I'm going to come to my house and 

656
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:26,321
you're going to unzip my

657
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:28,750
pants and you're going to suck my cock.
Like it's programming you program with 

658
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,320
people across the country.
Guys blow jobs,

659
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,840
but the two most popular things,
there's a lot.

660
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,700
There's black belts at lucid dreaming.
If you have the,

661
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,270
the men.
It's a mental exercise and you just want

662
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,790
to go to sleep on at night,
so it's very hard to do.

663
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:45,791
You have to be militant and you have to 
be sharpened in know while you're tired 

664
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:46,760
and ready to go to sleep.
It's hard,

665
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,810
but it worked a couple of times for me 
and the two things that most people like

666
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:55,811
doing or flying.
As soon as they figured out there in a 

667
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:55,811
dream,
they go,

668
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:55,811
fuck,
I'm gonna fly,

669
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:57,320
come flying shit.
And then sex.

670
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:02,321
They go right to sex.
And it's true because the two times it 

671
00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:04,661
worked for me and,
and when I used to have lucid dreams as 

672
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:05,330
a kid,
I actually had him when I was a kid once

673
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:10,331
or twice a year and I'm talking about 
being like eight or nine years old and 

674
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:14,680
the first thing I wanted to do with just
like find a girl and make out with her 

675
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:14,870
and just like humber wasn't a weird 
thing.

676
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,040
It was a weird thing.
It was,

677
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,960
I was a little kid.
It was a weird thing.

678
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,080
I wanted to go look for girls and I 
remember these lucid dreams.

679
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:22,640
I remember a couple I'll never forget.

680
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,540
Amazing that when your hormones are at 
your highest,

681
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,330
that's when you're the youngest and 
dumbest and not able to.

682
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,910
When you're 13,
you're shit is killing you all day.

683
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,380
Baffled.
It's like you went through your whole 

684
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,511
life feeling like pretty much the same 
dude just slowly growing and then all 

685
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:42,070
the sudden you hit 30.
You

686
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,070
get to a storm of confusion.
In high school we did is hard all day.

687
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,800
You don't know what the fuck is going on
and God forbid you find a girl's willing

688
00:29:50,801 --> 00:29:52,330
to touch your Dick.
Oh my God.

689
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:54,580
You stick to her like glue.
Like she.

690
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,990
She's like,
you're a drug dealer,

691
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,260
you're a crack addict and she's your 
drug dealer and you're hanging around 

692
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,721
with it.
No matter what state became believe 

693
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:03,970
different things to hang out with.
A girl when the fuck did that,

694
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:08,971
I haven't ever just make an out because 
it's going to be making off while I'm 

695
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:08,971
making it out.
Awesome.

696
00:30:08,971 --> 00:30:09,890
You just want to make an offer.
I want to go to movies just to make out.

697
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,510
Just like whatever.
Fuck them over.

698
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,790
Just make out.
It's the only private spot at 13 that 

699
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:16,790
you could find dark,
but anyway,

700
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,410
it's about these dreams.

701
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,740
I ended up doing it twice and that's 
what I did the first time.

702
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,590
As soon as I figured out I was dreamed 
that you are dreaming and I'm like,

703
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,800
I am dreaming.
Everything became really bright and 

704
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:28,800
immediately I flew with my hands down 
like that,

705
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,800
like fucking ironman through canyons and
it was so bright and all I kept thinking

706
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:35,650
was,
I can't believe this is a dream.

707
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,230
This is so clear.
That's just so vivid.

708
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,370
That's all I was thinking.
Dreams are amazing.

709
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,440
I'm flying through king.
It's like iron man.

710
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,170
And I thought,
Oh,

711
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:46,360
I'm going to have sex now.
And this is when I was single.

712
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:51,361
This is before I was married.
So I was a single man so immediately 

713
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:53,380
from the sea,
I don't remember like a video.

714
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,500
I descended from the candidate into the 
canyons and up came this girl hiker,

715
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,260
this hot girl,
and she just smiled at me like a dream 

716
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,260
in a movie.

717
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,080
Like if this was in a movie,
I came down into the canyon,

718
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:06,130
she's hiking,
she's hot,

719
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,340
and we,
I take off her clothes and we start the 

720
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:11,560
love making and I couldn't.
And I remember thinking,

721
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:16,480
I can't believe this is a dream.
I see this is soul real.

722
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,950
And then Bam.
I woke up with a vicious boner.

723
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,990
Yeah,
right there.

724
00:31:19,991 --> 00:31:22,270
I woke up.
It was so crystal clear.

725
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,710
I just got too excited.
I'm like,

726
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,260
I can't believe like I'm having sex 
right now.

727
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,470
That's always been my issue.
Coming all the time,

728
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,140
but not really been my issue with lucid 
dreams that they go away too easy 

729
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,550
because you get excited because I can't 
believe you're dreaming.

730
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:41,551
Yeah.
And you know that all you gotta do is 

731
00:31:41,551 --> 00:31:41,551
open your eyes and then you start 
opening your goddamn eyes.

732
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,240
Those supplements had,
uh,

733
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,220
hit the sprint program that we're on.
I'm telling you,

734
00:31:45,221 --> 00:31:50,221
man,
you'll dream amazing sprint program and 

735
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:50,590
you want just the alliance sprint 
program.

736
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:52,690
What's the alliance print program?
It's a,

737
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,150
it's basically just for like the first 
minute,

738
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:56,680
15 seconds,
like you're running by her,

739
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,710
by herself.
I got a 15 incline treadmill,

740
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,380
sprinting.
It's a treadmill,

741
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:03,880
sprinting,
and then we also do a 400 meters,

742
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,430
a 15 times,
so running around the track.

743
00:32:06,431 --> 00:32:11,431
That's one sprint.
15 Times 55 52nd rest and then again 

744
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:15,691
boom.
So this is something that everyone on 

745
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:15,691
the team does pretty much.
Yeah.

746
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:15,691
Wow.
That's.

747
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:20,100
Is that unique to an MMA camp that a 
team has a single a strength and 

748
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,700
conditioning protocol that everybody 
follows like a.

749
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,850
I think it's very important to follow a 
set structure.

750
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:25,620
Yeah.
You know,

751
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,260
you know the,
you know,

752
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:28,690
the ground rules is kind of like how 
we're talking about the math program the

753
00:32:28,691 --> 00:32:31,240
other day,
the lumosity stuff.

754
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:34,270
You just basically just set a good 
foundation if you have good stability,

755
00:32:34,271 --> 00:32:36,000
good foundation I think.
I think it's,

756
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:40,040
you're a lot more easier to.
Can do a lot of MMA camps have

757
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,720
that,
like they have like a sprint series that

758
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:44,170
the whole camp we'll do every week or 
you know,

759
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,000
strength and conditioning series that 
the whole camp.

760
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:46,910
We'll do.
I imagine,

761
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:48,620
I think,
I think I've heard of Greg Jackson,

762
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,530
I think he's real famous for is a sandal
domes.

763
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,330
Yeah,
yeah,

764
00:32:52,331 --> 00:32:53,000
yeah,
something like that.

765
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:54,200
So I think,
I think that's,

766
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,480
that's a good one you see by like Carlos
condit and guys like that always hinton 

767
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,760
some,
a high altitude and I know Diego Sanchez

768
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:05,060
is all being in the altitude so.
But I think I think everybody does their

769
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:07,250
own thing or at least there is some type
of structure where they do,

770
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:09,920
do Sam Dume.
So a lot of the big teams at least.

771
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,150
Yeah.
Yeah.

772
00:33:11,151 --> 00:33:12,330
I think there's,
um,

773
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,530
there's a big benefit to a team isn't 
there when you're a,

774
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,560
you're a fighter being is the most,
it's the most intimate individual thing 

775
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:20,560
ever.

776
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,910
It's the most lonely,
separated,

777
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:24,340
selfish completely.
Yes.

778
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:29,450
Fish completely on your own.
But there's a massive benefit obviously 

779
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,490
to being a part of a team because you 
see like,

780
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,290
like at this point in time there seems 
to be like a separation.

781
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:38,330
There's very few high level fighters 
that are training like individually that

782
00:33:38,331 --> 00:33:43,331
you don't know who they're training if 
you don't hear about them training with 

783
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:43,331
anybody.
Good.

784
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:43,331
It's very,
very few.

785
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:47,890
It's usually guys that are just sort of 
just getting into the game and then the 

786
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:47,890
fine.
Like when Jon Jones,

787
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:52,480
before he joined Jackson's camp,
he was up in upstate New York and you 

788
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,501
know,
didn't have guys like his level around 

789
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,100
there and went over to Jackson's and 
then really started to catch a stride.

790
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,660
He was searching for that.
A coach.

791
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,840
Everyone package.
Yeah.

792
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:07,090
I think a lot of the fighters need that.
That's what I do with a lot of my time 

793
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,740
and money was spent searching for a 
coach and just a good camp.

794
00:34:09,741 --> 00:34:14,741
Somebody that just fit me.
It took me a while to settle in and 

795
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:14,741
then,
you know,

796
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:15,080
I think I found that at alliance and it 
may be other stuff.

797
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,590
Gang had good camps in this country.
Now you know,

798
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:21,410
they're there at one point in time.
It was just like att and you know,

799
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:23,210
there's still good and there's getting a
lot of people.

800
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:26,240
I mean,
tyrone Woodley over the over the week.

801
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,490
Gotcha.
Gotcha.

802
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,440
Do you know what?
This is what I think.

803
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:31,780
Here's what I think a tyrone woodley.
Tyrone says,

804
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,310
I'm watching a GSP and I'm watching 
Johnny Hendricks.

805
00:34:36,311 --> 00:34:38,710
I'm watching them and I'm.
And I'm really thinking,

806
00:34:38,711 --> 00:34:40,330
I don't know.
This is a bad thing to say,

807
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,510
but I'm thinking like,
who cares who wins here?

808
00:34:43,511 --> 00:34:46,120
Because Tyrone Woodley is going to come 
and fuck these dudes.

809
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,380
Both these dudes up.
Well,

810
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:49,030
Tyron Woodley.
Just lots of jake shields.

811
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,140
Yeah,
but man that he got knocked out by named

812
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:53,210
mark too.
I mean,

813
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,360
I think tyron woodley is a bad 
motherfucker.

814
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,930
He's an amazing athlete,
but tyron Woodley,

815
00:34:58,960 --> 00:34:59,830
he's,
he's,

816
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,260
you know,
he really has to be cost check,

817
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,500
but he really has to face like the 
really high level guys like Carlos 

818
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,580
Condit and we'll see if he's capable.
I think he's an amazing athlete and if 

819
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,091
he's not capable of beating those,
that caliber guy now or he wasn't maybe 

820
00:35:15,091 --> 00:35:16,840
a year ago when he fought mark warrant.
He's gonna keep getting better.

821
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,460
That's what I think.
The only reason I say that is just based

822
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:23,920
on that cost check,
like just based on that,

823
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,310
uh,
he had all the potential high,

824
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,550
high level wrestler and he had a,
he has a good striking,

825
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,300
but in that cost check fight,
I saw different human being ice.

826
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,730
I'd never seen anybody throw punches 
that fast.

827
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:38,610
And MMA,
that's the fastest,

828
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,580
most powerful.
You see those right hands.

829
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,390
He would.
There was like several of them.

830
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,020
You're like,
what?

831
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,230
I just missed it.
It was just that you just saw a display 

832
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:51,290
of immense power.
Like I don't see anybody throwing 

833
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,420
punches like that.
What a system with heat,

834
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,260
how cost check.
But you know what I mean?

835
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,060
It seems like he finally is putting it 
together.

836
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,560
I never did.
Did you notice that?

837
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,720
Holy Fuck.
That was fast.

838
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,790
Three different times.
I just want to caution,

839
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,440
same dude,
he came out,

840
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,510
he was wrestling people and everybody's 
like,

841
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,630
ah man,
this guy knows.

842
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:08,940
He does his wrestling.
Next thing you know,

843
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:11,280
he was knocking dudes out with the right
hand because it's starting to feel a lot

844
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:12,410
more confident,
you know,

845
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,400
probably after the show he got into a 
good camp,

846
00:36:14,401 --> 00:36:15,580
which now like,
Oh man,

847
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:16,770
no,
I have standup skills.

848
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,840
I'm already an athlete.
I know I can rustle.

849
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:24,110
Next thing you know,
he started to believe in his hands 

850
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,600
morning that I'd probably credit that to
like him being done at American top team

851
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,690
starting to train and to use his 
athleticism because the dude's obviously

852
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:28,320
a freak of nature.

853
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,380
I think you see Woodley's fight with Jay
heroin.

854
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,650
I probably did,
but I like 90 percent of those fights.

855
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:34,460
I forget them.

856
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,570
Who was the first round knockout?
It was incredible.

857
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,340
It was just swarmed them.

858
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,310
Doesn't it seem like the way he threw 
that right hand,

859
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:42,410
like no one will survive that thing.
If he cannot.

860
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:45,950
He's got that,
that's for sure.

861
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,390
You know,
and he's got the wrestling.

862
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:52,391
I think you know what happens with even 
the Brazilian fighters to his high level

863
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:58,270
Jujitsu,
black belt still come in and they 

864
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:01,421
definitely are not where they need to be
with our striking and some of them like 

865
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:05,810
super high level guys,
they come in and try on the May and they

866
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:10,830
just haven't spent enough time with our 
striking and they'll just leave mma and 

867
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:16,061
just go back to Jujitsu because they 
didn't get the striking was just too 

868
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:16,061
hard,
but then there's some guys that stick it

869
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:18,860
out and they go through rough patches 
and they lose because of their striking.

870
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,090
People will criticize them because of 
their striking like Vodoun for instance,

871
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,600
and then after a while they just stick 
it out and my Damien Maia,

872
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,790
they just stick it out.
People talking shit on their striking,

873
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,960
but they stick it out.
They handle some losses and as long as 

874
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,291
they just keep going and keep the 
consistency of all of a sudden the 

875
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:42,040
silver dome is a dangerous striker.
Now all of a sudden Damien Maia has a 

876
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,360
real legit stripe.

877
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,670
Could you find out what type of man you 
are when you're.

878
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,690
When you,
you know,

879
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,820
when you're winning,
you're on top,

880
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
everybody thinks you're all good,
but then when you lose you're like,

881
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:53,841
man,
like I really got to work on some 

882
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:56,211
things,
but you find out what type of man this 

883
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:56,211
guy is going to be.
Is he going to go back out there?

884
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:56,670
Is you're going to work on things and 
getting better?

885
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:59,310
Is he just going to go out there and 
fold over and then that was it.

886
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,830
Yeah.
For some fighters it is a big confidence

887
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:06,831
hit that they never recover from.
They have this idea that there are 

888
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:07,440
unbeatable from the jump and then once 
someone beats them,

889
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,310
they have to sort of rethink their whole
paradigm and some guys don't ever do it.

890
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,430
Some guys come back stronger,
you know,

891
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,470
some guys come back from a loss and 
there are different guy there.

892
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:18,120
They're more focused,
more intense,

893
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:23,121
more aware.
They cut out all the bullshit in their 

894
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:23,121
camp.
They thought back on all the things that

895
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:23,121
they did that might've crossed

896
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:23,620
it's wisdom.
You know?

897
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:25,540
It's just like growing and getting 
older,

898
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,430
making changes just even outside of 
fighting,

899
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:32,431
you know,
fighting doesn't define half these guys 

900
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:32,431
that are in the octagon because a lot of
them are real cool dudes.

901
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:36,721
You know,
everybody I've ever met has been been 

902
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:36,721
like super down to earth.
Awesome.

903
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:37,390
You meet a lot of cool guys,
but it does.

904
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:38,560
It does play a difference,
you know?

905
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,200
Yeah.
There's no doubt man.

906
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,800
There's no doubt.
Do you think that you just cut down from

907
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:47,940
155 to 145 pounds and that's like one of
the big issues in mma,

908
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:51,460
the people keep talking about is the 
amount of weight guys cut in.

909
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,650
How they cut it.
You know,

910
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,030
guy like Tyron Woodley,
he,

911
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:57,230
what does he weigh?
How is he won?

912
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:57,970
Seventy.
That's.

913
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,350
That makes zero sense.
I know I'm not racist,

914
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,300
but you ever noticed like black guys,
really,

915
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,280
really huge,
right?

916
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,640
I love when people say that and then 
they talk about black people are racist 

917
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,970
and having a perfect body and having the
perfect body.

918
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:13,560
How's that?
How is liking watermelon?

919
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:16,020
Bad watermelons fucking delicious.
Exactly.

920
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,070
And well,
they'll jump on this

921
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,210
scale and then they're like,
they're,

922
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:21,280
they're not as heavy or you know,
like their body's not as dense.

923
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:26,281
I remember this friend of mine back home
demicco and he was just this big dude 

924
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:30,571
and we used to work together at the same
company and he would just eat whatever 

925
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:30,571
chips,
hot dogs,

926
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,110
whatever.
And he was just always jack man,

927
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,390
whenever I understood it,
you know,

928
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,520
and I'm like,
I'm over here getting like a belly.

929
00:39:35,521 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm like,
Jesus,

930
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,410
no way.
It's like that.

931
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,170
It's just having a mesomorphic frame.
That's what it is.

932
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,840
And that's what Tyron Woodley.
He's like extreme Mesomorph,

933
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,690
you know,
when you cut down to 1:45,

934
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,790
how much did you have to lose?
Man,

935
00:39:47,791 --> 00:39:51,420
I'm probably one 76.
[inaudible] 77 right now.

936
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,310
My God,

937
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,380
I cut a lot of weight,
but I credit that to the fitness vet 

938
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:57,470
diet that I'm on.
And George Lockhart,

939
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,800
who just knows how to weight cut.
And I was thinking about it for a long 

940
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,290
time and the,
just the change is going down there.

941
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:05,330
I'm a lot faster.
I feel a lot more athletic.

942
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,610
Uh,
I'm working on my athleticism,

943
00:40:07,611 --> 00:40:10,190
I'm trying to be a lot more precise and 
just,

944
00:40:10,191 --> 00:40:12,380
I know that the power is always there,
it's a lot more natural,

945
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:15,260
but I feel like I have just a better 
mental edge.

946
00:40:15,261 --> 00:40:20,261
I can,
I can use a lot more of tools at 145 

947
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:20,840
pounds and you know,
I basically grew up inside the octagon.

948
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,520
I probably shouldn't have been there at 
a certain time.

949
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,850
It's just that I,
my heart carried me through like a lot 

950
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:27,850
of fights.
So like I said,

951
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:29,630
I was searching for this camp to help me
to help me and be like,

952
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:30,290
man,
let's get a hold of me.

953
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,250
I have,
I have talent,

954
00:40:31,251 --> 00:40:36,251
you know,
I just wanted to get out of my hometown 

955
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:36,251
after a certain why I can only,
which was,

956
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,010
which was des Moines,
Iowa and uh,

957
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,690
you know,
I was just like,

958
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:40,430
man,
I need to get ahold of some better guys.

959
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:43,250
I gotta I gotTa train,
get a higher level coaching,

960
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,950
just different type of stuff.
I didn't,

961
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:46,160
I mean I didn't even have a striking 
coach.

962
00:40:46,161 --> 00:40:48,860
I was just going to gym to gym,
whichever was the best I was there.

963
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,800
So I think,
I think it just credited that to like we

964
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:56,801
said,
you don't mind my coaches and then you 

965
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:56,801
know,
making that cut.

966
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:58,640
I need the George Lockhart and fitness 
vet because he gives me everything.

967
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,170
I mean I'm water load and a lot,
you know,

968
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,490
I don't want to give away too much of 
this stuff,

969
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:03,860
but I feel oh,
I feel amazing.

970
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,870
And it's the,
it's the reload after the weight cut,

971
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:11,130
this stuff and the things that he has me
eat specific's and everything that I'm 

972
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:11,240
calculating it.
It's amazing.

973
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,260
Phil.
So if you get down to 1:45,

974
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:15,970
what are you wearing when you walk into 
the octagon?

975
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,330
About one slash 70.
That's crazy.

976
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,020
Oh my God.
Are you using

977
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,150
eating,
eating light?

978
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:23,660
Yeah,
I do.

979
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,280
I do.
How many ivy bags do you put?

980
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,300
I do too.
I do a one water regular water and then 

981
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:30,470
I do like a warm temperature,
like a sodium bag

982
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:36,010
just to obtain.
You have to like if you didn't have 

983
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:36,010
those bags it would make

984
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:36,010
a big difference.
Right?

985
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:36,010
Yeah,
hell yeah,

986
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,640
you can definitely tell people that 
don't like,

987
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:41,030
you know that they don't want to do the 
bags and I keep telling them at the high

988
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,170
level,
you know,

989
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:45,890
you want to rehydrate scientifically and

990
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:52,090
yeah,
there was a guy in the UFC that got 

991
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:52,730
caught way back in the day because he 
was taking blood out of his body to make

992
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:55,700
weight.
They went to his hotel room.

993
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:58,940
There was a doctor there and fucking 
bags of his blood.

994
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,310
They took it out.
I don't know what they did.

995
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:06,311
They stored it somehow or another,
I guess they had a freezer or a 

996
00:42:06,311 --> 00:42:06,311
refrigerator there or something and they
put it back in.

997
00:42:06,311 --> 00:42:08,510
His body looks like blood doping,
like blood doping.

998
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:13,511
Yes,
but I mean they're not giving them 

999
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:13,550
enough chance to rebuild the blood 
cells.

1000
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:18,551
The blood being.
The way it works is your body rebuilds 

1001
00:42:18,551 --> 00:42:19,400
all those blood cells and then you 
reintroduce all this extra blood.

1002
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:24,550
You've got crazy amounts of blood now 
and your body is eventually going to 

1003
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,550
burn it off,
but until then,

1004
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:29,020
enjoy the benefits of extreme production
of oxygen or utilization of oxygen.

1005
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,560
That's what that epo stuff does to what 
those cyclists keep getting busted for,

1006
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,960
that he was going too hard,
too hard out there.

1007
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:42,190
So this guy,
he cut the weight and then the last 

1008
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:42,400
couple of pounds he took out and blood.
Nice.

1009
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,420
And then he put it right back in.
When he went back,

1010
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,200
I'd probably,
you know,

1011
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:47,120
some people will pass on.
I mean you already cutting down,

1012
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:48,470
wait and then go to do that.
You know,

1013
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,210
I guess depending on how much weight he 
cut,

1014
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,340
I've seen dudes that look like they're 
on death's door.

1015
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,580
I've seen dudes that are cutting weight 
like Travis Luder when he fought 

1016
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,521
Anderson Silva.
I've never seen a guy look worse in my 

1017
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:01,280
life that's still alive.
He was shuffling.

1018
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:04,250
He couldn't walk band.
He was shuffling towards the scale.

1019
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:08,060
The second time he was making weight,
his lips were chapped as fuck.

1020
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,510
His whole face was sucked in.
He looked like he was dying.

1021
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:15,140
I mean he was dying.
He was essentially draining himself out.

1022
00:43:15,141 --> 00:43:17,570
But he just miscalculated.
You get down.

1023
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,610
He was this close to beating Anderson 
Silva.

1024
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,170
He was all over at all.
The guys who are like super talented,

1025
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:29,171
it didn't live up to their potential.
Travis Luder might be number one in my 

1026
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:29,171
book.
He's one of those guys.

1027
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:30,080
You're talking about the training 
himself,

1028
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,610
trained himself.
He didn't like.

1029
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:37,030
He didn't like.
He was from Texas and he went to 

1030
00:43:37,371 --> 00:43:40,010
Jackson's towards the last few fights of
his career.

1031
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:45,011
I think he was at Jackson's when he lost
in the tall and I think that might've 

1032
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:47,711
been the last fight.
He's got some back issues though too 

1033
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:47,780
from Jujitsu.
Who doesn't know you,

1034
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,590
you,
you know,

1035
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,560
constantly training and enrolling and 
you're going to get some back issues.

1036
00:43:51,561 --> 00:43:56,561
Ricardo Laborio told me he's got like 
six bulging discs or seven bulging 

1037
00:43:56,561 --> 00:43:57,260
discs,
something crazy.

1038
00:43:57,261 --> 00:43:59,750
These guys are all like a little bit 
jacked up.

1039
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:00,220
Their backs

1040
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,930
need to get on the Lacrosse ball.
Man Medicine bond that Eric did.

1041
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,700
I buy those a like it opens up my 
posture.

1042
00:44:07,701 --> 00:44:09,590
If I start going like this.
I don't know if you've seen.

1043
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,680
If people were watching,
like you'll start getting rounded like 

1044
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:14,680
vandelay does.
It can't throw a straight punch,

1045
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:16,430
but if you get into Lacrosse ball and 
you're able to break up your Pec minor,

1046
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:17,720
your Pec major,
your lats,

1047
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:18,590
your traps,
you know,

1048
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:21,530
even even like your Scapula,
you're able to get into those knots that

1049
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,340
your elbow is not going to hurt anymore 
because you're,

1050
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:29,341
you're elongating the muscles that need 
to be in long gated if you're talking 

1051
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:30,860
about like a rumble roller or Lacrosse 
ball,

1052
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,100
cross ball or like a

1053
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,130
softball or a baseball.
So hard like I get in my hip flexors 

1054
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,640
because a constantly running,
wrestling and being like on your thing.

1055
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:43,641
Like my,
my knees will start to hurt so I'll get 

1056
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:43,641
on like a lacrosse ball.
I mean I'll break up everything,

1057
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,810
every muscle down from my hip.
I'll,

1058
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,610
I'll be the.
I'll start at the glue,

1059
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:52,640
the,
the hip flexor and I just never 

1060
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:52,640
accidentally go up your ass.
Never,

1061
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:52,640
never.

1062
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,590
Did you wrestle?

1063
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:00,600
Yeah.
As a,

1064
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:01,340
as a kid,
uh,

1065
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,840
as a,
as a kid growing up.

1066
00:45:02,841 --> 00:45:03,100
I did.
Okay.

1067
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,090
It makes it better.
Grab it and move it towards you.

1068
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,990
You can just do like this,
bring it towards you.

1069
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:13,850
Nice.
Got It.

1070
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:14,890
There you go.
Look at that.

1071
00:45:14,891 --> 00:45:16,940
Nice.
I actually grew up a wrestling as a kid.

1072
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:17,870
My,
my,

1073
00:45:17,871 --> 00:45:18,980
uh,
one of my uncles,

1074
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,040
it was my grandfather.
He was really big into like wrestling 

1075
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,200
and boxing and stuff like that.
So he,

1076
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:24,760
uh,
uh,

1077
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,390
when my parents were kind of going 
through a hard time,

1078
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:28,100
he's the one who encouraged me to get 
into wrestling,

1079
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,370
get involved in sports like that.
So I started wrestling as a kid.

1080
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,580
How old?
About five years old until.

1081
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:37,340
Did you wrestle in high school?
I did wrestle in high school.

1082
00:45:37,341 --> 00:45:42,341
I wrestled a one year in high school.
My parents had a complication so I was 

1083
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:47,081
Kinda,
I was transferring to like a lot of 

1084
00:45:47,081 --> 00:45:48,881
schools so I was kind of wrestling but 
like I was on like another side of town 

1085
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:48,881
that one week I was on another side of 
town.

1086
00:45:48,881 --> 00:45:51,500
There's a recipe for becoming a fighter,
a bunch of schools.

1087
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So when I,
when I wrestled I wasn't like great or 

1088
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,000
anything.
I just,

1089
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,000
you know,
used heart just out their stronghold and

1090
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,901
people and,
and that's basically how I got involved 

1091
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:01,901
with UFC was through my grandfather 
watching that.

1092
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:03,380
So I do have a little bit of a wrestling
background.

1093
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,790
I'd say my wrestling's a lot better now 
working with a good guys,

1094
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,810
Olympic level guys,
guys like dominick Cruz coaches pushing 

1095
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,411
me,
so I'm always in there with like a good 

1096
00:46:14,411 --> 00:46:14,411
set of dudes,
you know better how long you've,

1097
00:46:14,411 --> 00:46:15,260
you been with alliance now you're in San
Diego,

1098
00:46:15,261 --> 00:46:17,420
right?
Training about three years now.

1099
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,500
That's awesome.
Solid.

1100
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,310
Yeah.
The first year it took me a while to get

1101
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:21,170
to get used to it,
man.

1102
00:46:21,171 --> 00:46:22,250
We,
we train hard up there.

1103
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:23,630
We spar hard,
we go hard.

1104
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,740
A lot of drills.

1105
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,570
A lot of technique.
And it took you like,

1106
00:46:26,571 --> 00:46:28,730
what was the biggest transition?
The hardest part of it?

1107
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:33,790
Conditioning or what was,
it was hard to get used to just the day 

1108
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:33,790
in,
day out and just the,

1109
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:34,570
uh,
I mean,

1110
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,930
I say I hung in there,
you know,

1111
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,880
I mean I have my good days,
my bad days,

1112
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:42,881
but it's just,
it's just everybody's after the same 

1113
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:42,881
goals,
the same dreams,

1114
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:42,881
but it's the day in,
day out,

1115
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:43,670
you know,
anybody can fight,

1116
00:46:43,671 --> 00:46:45,670
we can go right to the Chevron,
you know,

1117
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:46,670
and to start a fight,
you know,

1118
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:49,850
anybody can just go fight.
But when you discipline yourself,

1119
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:51,040
it's the day in.
You know,

1120
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:53,300
the hardest thing is when you're sore 
like you're talking about,

1121
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:53,840
you're like,
oh man,

1122
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:55,700
I gotta get up.
I got to go train and I,

1123
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,110
you want to disappoint your,
your boys,

1124
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:58,750
let alone do you want to lose the fight?
You know,

1125
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,660
you got to give up who you are now for 
who you want to be in the future.

1126
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,670
Yeah.
George St Pierre was talking about after

1127
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:06,250
the fight.
It was,

1128
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:11,251
it was an interesting thing.
I don't want to hear nothing about 

1129
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:11,251
George St Pierre.
This podcast.

1130
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,070
Can you imagine?
Imagine if we just made.

1131
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,640
We should have,
we should have trolled everyone else.

1132
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,500
And they're like,
you're right,

1133
00:47:18,501 --> 00:47:20,940
you're right.
You're right about that fight funnel.

1134
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,810
Even that important.
I don't want it.

1135
00:47:22,811 --> 00:47:25,260
That's the last thing,
but he was talking about I can't sleep.

1136
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,090
He's got a few personal issues 
apparently,

1137
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,980
allegedly that's being reported and

1138
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
um,
unfortunately with his family's health 

1139
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:34,980
and what have you,
I don't know what's true,

1140
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:35,830
what's not true,
but that's what this story is,

1141
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:38,440
which makes a ton of sense why he saying
that he can't sleep,

1142
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,000
you know,
he's having a real hard time.

1143
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:43,810
He thinks he's going crazy and yeah,
he was talking about on the podcast,

1144
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:48,811
he said he gets abducted by aliens,
but I think also it's just fucking hard 

1145
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:50,080
to keep up.
I think what you're saying about the day

1146
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:50,890
in,
day out,

1147
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:55,891
day in,
day out and intensify that even more 

1148
00:47:55,891 --> 00:47:56,050
than you're the champ,
you're the top of a hill with a bunch of

1149
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:57,730
hungry sharks nipping at your feet,

1150
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,860
but he's stressed out all the time and 
I'm telling you,

1151
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:04,861
you gotta,
you gotTa have those types of Lacrosse 

1152
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:07,270
balls.
Like you got to keep your stress levels 

1153
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,270
down because if you're stressed out all 
the time,

1154
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,020
say say a fight week,
I'm stressed out all week,

1155
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:09,580
I'm just,
I can't get my weight.

1156
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:10,870
I'm stressing out.
I'm freaking out.

1157
00:48:10,871 --> 00:48:15,871
I'm going through crazy.
So my nervous system is going to become 

1158
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:15,871
like a radic.
It's like,

1159
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:19,381
man,
we are stress and we're going crazy 

1160
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:19,381
right now.
By the time you go to fight and you need

1161
00:48:19,381 --> 00:48:21,070
all those hormones that you need to go,
like boost yourself up,

1162
00:48:21,071 --> 00:48:23,590
get yourself back into that mode.
Your body is used to be like,

1163
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:24,940
no bro,
we're already tapped out.

1164
00:48:24,941 --> 00:48:27,080
You know,
we've been filling out.

1165
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:30,460
So then like you're just like boom.
You just hit like a crash as compared to

1166
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:32,650
if you're relaxed all week,
you're chilling out,

1167
00:48:32,651 --> 00:48:34,750
you're not really.
You're just thinking the good vibes,

1168
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:39,751
you know,
weight's going down and things are just 

1169
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:39,751
going beautiful.
Everything's looking sharp,

1170
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:39,751
but just keeping yourself relaxed the 
whole time.

1171
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,670
So then when you go to fight,
you're energized to the Max.

1172
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:43,330
You're like,
boom.

1173
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:43,990
It's all right.
No,

1174
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,340
it's,
this is what we trained for it.

1175
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,870
Yeah,
that's the adrenaline dump,

1176
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:50,740
right?
I think the all week or few days leading

1177
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:51,250
up to it,

1178
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,320
a little tents,
man.

1179
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:58,321
I think.
I think India is a relaxed bro and you 

1180
00:48:58,321 --> 00:49:00,521
know like this.
This is the fight game where we have 

1181
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:00,521
small gloves,
isn't boxing,

1182
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:00,790
you know where you're hitting yourself 
with 16th,

1183
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,150
which is even bad as it is.
These guys,

1184
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:05,190
man,
some of these dudes that are swinging at

1185
00:49:05,191 --> 00:49:06,940
you that you know,
it could put you out any.

1186
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:07,710
Any second

1187
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,040
shit man.
How about your fight with honey?

1188
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,470
Jason,
how about that shit?

1189
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,010
You caught him within the first round.
Holy Shit.

1190
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:16,990
Did you see that fight?
God Damn.

1191
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:18,310
Dude,
let me tell you something.

1192
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:22,600
That followup right hand was ferocious.
There was no hesitation.

1193
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:25,390
You cracked him with that and you were 
on autopilot.

1194
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:28,960
You just launched that right hand on him
and that shit was perfect.

1195
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:31,050
Pull that out Brian.
Pull that video up.

1196
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,580
Jeremy Stevens versus Ronnie.
Jason.

1197
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,230
Ron,
why you pronounce it haunted?

1198
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:37,180
You need a poster,
you know would make a great poster.

1199
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:40,100
That big right there is a poster of that
upper cut

1200
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,010
mid,
upper cut.

1201
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,150
Great poster.
Come on.

1202
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,170
I'd have to give the posts away man.
I don't like looking at stuff like that.

1203
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,690
I read this book one time and this 
architect,

1204
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,250
because people will come up to me like,
oh man,

1205
00:49:56,251 --> 00:50:01,251
like,
like what was your favorite fight or 

1206
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:01,251
whatever.
And I always tell them my next one,

1207
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:05,310
you know,
because I just think of like 

1208
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:05,310
visualization visionary,
you know,

1209
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:05,550
like always want,
like it was a cool knock.

1210
00:50:05,551 --> 00:50:10,551
I appreciate her but give me like all 
the love but there's still more work in 

1211
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:10,551
the gym that I'd been working on,
you know,

1212
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:15,441
and I've been,
I've been at this for awhile but I 

1213
00:50:15,441 --> 00:50:17,571
really feel like I'm just starting to 
like barely tap into my potential skin 

1214
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:18,490
better 20.
So 27 and I,

1215
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,350
my,
my first on my 21st birthday,

1216
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:23,880
it was my,
that was I fought Din Thomas.

1217
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,220
You must've been some crazy motherfucker
coming up locally,

1218
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,220
right?
For you to like for Joe Silva to take 

1219
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:33,220
notice of you.
You're 21 years old and go,

1220
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,270
we got to put this fucking beast where 
you Beeston people in Iowa.

1221
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,080
What was going on?

1222
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:36,870
Yeah,
I was doing the same,

1223
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,010
I was hitting people with spinning back 
fist,

1224
00:50:39,011 --> 00:50:40,930
a flying knee.
We're knocking everybody out,

1225
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:42,730
knocking a lot of guys out.
Not Everybody,

1226
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,630
you know,
I had a few,

1227
00:50:43,631 --> 00:50:48,190
a few submissions and stuff like that.
But what was your record before the UFC?

1228
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:50,350
I think it was like seven.
One 81,

1229
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:53,340
something like that.
Mostly knockouts mostly.

1230
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,140
Yep.
Comes from not vicious knockouts.

1231
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,640
Did you have a highlight reel of like 
vicious striking,

1232
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,060
like how to Joe Silva?
My highlight reel is so old because 

1233
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,760
anytime I put something for the UFC up 
there,

1234
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,200
they just take it down,
you know,

1235
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:06,800
so I don't really get a chance.
Not A,

1236
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,840
not a lot of people.
Everybody that I could probably like 

1237
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,411
youtube is made is probably like men.
This is old school stuff like where is 

1238
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:13,411
this?
You know,

1239
00:51:13,411 --> 00:51:14,020
but when you fight a UFC guy who had the
uh,

1240
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:15,160
the honor to be like,
Hey,

1241
00:51:15,161 --> 00:51:18,220
can you send me over his tapes?
And then he got all the UFC tapes.

1242
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:19,960
What do you think about that?
About how they do.

1243
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,380
Here's,
here's the Kale right here.

1244
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,340
This is the slow mo version of it.
Oh my God,

1245
00:51:25,341 --> 00:51:28,050
that shit is perfect.
And look at this code.

1246
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,170
That might be one of the best one to 
Zara.

1247
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,960
Boom.
And blam.

1248
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,320
That shit is for.
I'm talking about right there when they 

1249
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:40,520
sense for Osha,
if I liked that.

1250
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:42,800
I liked that.
I liked seeing violence.

1251
00:51:42,801 --> 00:51:44,360
You know,
that I'm a big uh,

1252
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,090
for violence.
I like watching it.

1253
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,400
Uh,
but a fan of concussions.

1254
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:54,450
Yeah.
But when we're talking about the 

1255
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:54,570
monorepo thing where he held on to tap 
too late or too,

1256
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:55,340
too long,
man,

1257
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:56,450
I think he got.
I'm going to,

1258
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:58,430
I'm going to get bit controversial on 
this.

1259
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:03,431
I think he got a bum deal on that 
because I think what he held onto was 

1260
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:07,100
barely a second and yeah,
it's fucked up to do and he does it,

1261
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:12,101
but he did it way worse in the past and 
I think he's at least a little bit 

1262
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:16,241
crazy.
I think it's real hard to get that guy 

1263
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:16,241
to let go.
I think when he's trying to tap you,

1264
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:19,820
it's some life and death shit.
He grew up on a farm he liked,

1265
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:22,880
had no schooling.
He was eating pig slop when he was 13.

1266
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:28,060
I mean,
I think you're not dealing with a 

1267
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,060
regular dude here.

1268
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,060
Yeah,
that's a,

1269
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:28,060
that's a very aggressive,
uh,

1270
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,610
behavior to be living like that.
I'd never heard that about him,

1271
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:33,740
but I imagine that's a little bit more 
of an aggressive behavior than anything

1272
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,350
but in a very,
very,

1273
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:37,030
very,
very tough environment,

1274
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,300
but much,
much harder than I think most of us can 

1275
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:42,300
comprehend.
Listen,

1276
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,230
listen,
that just blows me away,

1277
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:45,030
dude.
That's crazy.

1278
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:50,031
In pig slop,
he has a giant scar on his chest from 

1279
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:52,321
when they couldn't get.
He had cut open and they couldn't get a 

1280
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:54,811
medical attention,
so they use like crazy glue on it and 

1281
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:54,811
try to pinch it together.
He's a giant scar on his chest.

1282
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:59,280
I agree with you though.
I think he got a raw deal because I 

1283
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,400
think that there's something wrong with 
what he did.

1284
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,670
Then there's something wrong with what 
Dan Henderson did to Brisbane or what 

1285
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:06,190
you just did right there.
I love that show.

1286
00:53:06,191 --> 00:53:06,440
No,
no,

1287
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:11,450
no.
I didn't get called off and that guy 

1288
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:11,450
could have jumped up.

1289
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:11,450
I don't think.
Yeah,

1290
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:13,240
it was bad.
Like I,

1291
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,430
I happen to land the kick and then I 
came right back,

1292
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:18,550
right back to my base.
I kind of saw him go to get up,

1293
00:53:18,551 --> 00:53:23,551
which I thought maybe he was Tko because
I knew it was a good shot and I didn't 

1294
00:53:23,551 --> 00:53:27,451
expect it.
I expected it to land in land heart at 

1295
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:27,840
least scaring boat.
He leaned into that and it was basically

1296
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:28,860
all faints.
So then when I,

1297
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:33,980
I kicked it,
I landed back on my bass and he kinda 

1298
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:33,980
like went to like get up.
Like almost.

1299
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:38,270
It almost looked like he went to get up.
I missed a short split second that you 

1300
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:38,270
have to decide,
you know.

1301
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:40,020
But like I'm a lion bro.
I have a family to feed,

1302
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:45,040
you know,
as you said something about a guy like 

1303
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:51,751
Diego Sanchez.
That's what I think about when anybody 

1304
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:51,751
wants to stop a fight too soon.

1305
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:52,160
I think a lot of garlic,
Diego Sanchez,

1306
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:53,670
Diego Sanchez,
you can hit that dude.

1307
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:59,310
He wants to go out on the sheet and hit 
him with a media and he comes running 

1308
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,931
back at you even more power fights his 
mouthpiece and starts fucking bought 

1309
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:03,530
those stories and you cracked him.
I mean,

1310
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:06,530
I think that Shin might've knocked out 
any human being on earth,

1311
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,850
but it is possible that it got.
I mean,

1312
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,700
Diego's been hit with some bombs goes 
down and somehow under the recoveries.

1313
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:13,860
Oh,
I've cracked them before.

1314
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,460
And you do the same thing.
We've just done this in his backyard,

1315
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:21,470
does it,
you do a video of it and we just start 

1316
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:21,470
throwing down and that's the type of 
guy.

1317
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,700
Diego isn't.
He does bring that out in you,

1318
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:27,701
man.
I've had the funniest times training 

1319
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:27,701
with Diego Sanchez.
I owe him a lot,

1320
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:27,701
you know,
for,

1321
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:28,700
for me being here and getting to the 
next level,

1322
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:33,710
hit him and Josh near like one of my 
inspirational dudes and I'm hanging out 

1323
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:37,031
with these guys when I'm young and when 
he had a chance to invite me out and 

1324
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:37,031
train with them.
Like I,

1325
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:38,180
I had the funniest time train with Diego
Sanchez.

1326
00:54:38,181 --> 00:54:39,070
He's a wild man.
It's okay.

1327
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,470
A wild man.
He's the most,

1328
00:54:40,471 --> 00:54:45,471
in my opinion,
the most consistently entertained on 

1329
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:45,471
fighter.
Like maybe ever.

1330
00:54:45,471 --> 00:54:46,680
I got a question for you.
Who would you rather be?

1331
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,190
Would you rather,
would you rather be Mike Pierce?

1332
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,890
Would you rather be Mike Pierce?
Okay.

1333
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,830
Or go through it and Mike Pierce went 
through with it.

1334
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,840
Who's smart boss?
You have to live through it or lifted 

1335
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,790
with a honey.
Uh,

1336
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,330
Jason went through.
Well,

1337
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:05,790
the thing Mike,
Mike Pierce can heal his knee up.

1338
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,030
He totally replaced nothing towards 
spring.

1339
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:09,670
Disney,
you're,

1340
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:14,671
you're absolutely right in that 
situation when you do deal with the 

1341
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:17,721
consequences,
I think I would way rather be Mike 

1342
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:18,000
Pierce.
Way,

1343
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:18,420
way,
way,

1344
00:55:18,421 --> 00:55:18,870
way,
way,

1345
00:55:18,871 --> 00:55:19,290
way,
way,

1346
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:19,680
way,
way.

1347
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,800
But the difference is that he has a 
choice to let those submissions go.

1348
00:55:25,141 --> 00:55:29,160
It's not like a strike that's in motion 
in during the middle of the contest.

1349
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:31,080
Okay.
In absolute legal time,

1350
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,430
he connects.

1351
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,520
Jeremy connects with a perfectly placed 
shin and then a perfectly placed right 

1352
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:37,520
hand right afterwards.
That is,

1353
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,210
that is.
There's no referee stopping that fight.

1354
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:42,090
There's no one he knows this 
motherfucker's tapping.

1355
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:45,210
He knows the referees touching them.
That's where it gets weird.

1356
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:47,460
Where it gets weird is he fucking knows.
You know?

1357
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:48,240
He knows.
I know.

1358
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:51,630
He knows anybody's ever put a heel hook 
on anybody ever in their life knows that

1359
00:55:51,631 --> 00:55:53,370
guy was tapping.
He knew he was tapping.

1360
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:58,371
You knew the ref was stepping in.
He knew the fight was over and he still 

1361
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:58,371
held on.
But,

1362
00:55:58,371 --> 00:55:59,400
but this,
this is what I'm saying is when,

1363
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,500
when it comes to submissions,
right,

1364
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:04,500
there's,
you see the submission coming.

1365
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:09,650
He wraps up his leg.
If you watch the fight that is right 

1366
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:09,650
there,
he sees the submission coming.

1367
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:11,040
He's right there.
He's ready to go.

1368
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,390
So as soon as he taps,
he goes,

1369
00:56:12,391 --> 00:56:13,050
okay,
stop.

1370
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,200
And then he held on a little bit long.
When in these cases the referee is far 

1371
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:21,840
away.
So if the referee was right next to him,

1372
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,580
he would stop the and that last part.
Well that's a good.

1373
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,080
That's a good argument.
Logically.

1374
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:31,081
The problem with that is that you're 
dealing with a choice and when the guy 

1375
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:31,081
is holding onto a submission,
it's a choice.

1376
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:33,440
No,
but let's say it's not a momentum there.

1377
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:36,490
There've been fights.
Where do knock someone out and again,

1378
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:38,290
I love the violence.
I love it.

1379
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:43,291
I'm not saying cut it.
I'm just saying you can't knock with 

1380
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:43,291
some are perhaps because it happens a 
lot.

1381
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:45,220
When Dan Henderson bisbing in that 
situation,

1382
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:50,370
there is a chance,
I don't know exactly what was going on 

1383
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:50,370
in Dan Harrison's brain,
but there was a shower.

1384
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:54,690
He knows he's out,
but I'm going to fuck them up one more 

1385
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:54,690
time.

1386
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:57,150
The reps too far away to stop that shit,
but then he kind of knows like she kinda

1387
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,050
knows.
He doesn't kind of know.

1388
00:56:59,051 --> 00:57:00,540
You talked about in the postpaid press 
call,

1389
00:57:00,570 --> 00:57:03,760
he said he wanted to shut him up,
gave him that last punch to shut him up.

1390
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,890
So there's.
That's all legal because the referee,

1391
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:10,891
if the referee is not there,
that shit's on him and that guy is in 

1392
00:57:10,891 --> 00:57:11,650
survival mode.
He's in full war mode.

1393
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,060
I agree.
I liked that.

1394
00:57:13,061 --> 00:57:17,060
What I'm saying is what happened with 
with smart barth is exactly the same.

1395
00:57:17,061 --> 00:57:18,760
It's not here's where it would be 
different.

1396
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:23,761
He made a referee.
If the referee told him to stop and got 

1397
00:57:23,761 --> 00:57:24,970
in front of him and he pushed the 
referee aside,

1398
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:26,700
instill smashed him,
Dan,

1399
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,710
that's happened before then it would be 
worse than what he did because he's,

1400
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,240
he's,
he's sitting and concussed fighter and 

1401
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:37,240
one the referees already stopped the 
contest.

1402
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,860
This was just a race and this is in the 
rules.

1403
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,260
That guy was talking shit.
He decided to crack them.

1404
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,060
He saw him going down.
He's like,

1405
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:43,690
you know what,
bitch,

1406
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:45,910
I'm going to give you one more before 
the referee gets here.

1407
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:51,290
We all know what it was there,
but the bathroom was out of position 

1408
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:52,980
wasn't exactly the same because I do all
I am aware of.

1409
00:57:52,981 --> 00:57:57,981
The Rep did stop him,
but it was that the amount of time and 

1410
00:57:57,981 --> 00:58:01,000
it's almost like you crack a dude like 
that in sap and a bunch,

1411
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,010
you know,
like the fighter.

1412
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:08,040
No,
there have been times where a guy gets 

1413
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,051
crackly,
knocks out the guys out because I'm not 

1414
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:10,051
going to hit them again.
Stop it.

1415
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:10,051
Rough.
What?

1416
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:11,540
I mean,
you could do that too.

1417
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,530
Mark meal.
So there's a choice there so.

1418
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,340
Well,
those guys are friends.

1419
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,760
Big Difference.
She machida and Munoz who don't get me 

1420
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:20,760
wrong.
I like it.

1421
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:21,040
I would rather have the guy get hit one 
more time.

1422
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:24,310
I like when guys get Jack.
I like when guys get knocked out.

1423
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:25,490
Enjoy them

1424
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,030
though.
He.

1425
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:27,760
This is where I don't agree.
I,

1426
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:29,250
I.
That was kind of a stoppage.

1427
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:30,560
You know what?
That could have been questionable,

1428
00:58:30,561 --> 00:58:32,130
but the guy has done it a couple times.
Yes.

1429
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:33,700
So,
so now they're,

1430
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,640
now they're going like,
okay,

1431
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:36,830
what the heck?
But the guy actually made a statement.

1432
00:58:36,831 --> 00:58:41,831
He goes,
I couldn't fill the guy tapped because 

1433
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:41,831
the referee was on me.
Now that's it.

1434
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:43,800
That's key.
That's a key point were like,

1435
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:44,910
dude,
the referees on you're like,

1436
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:48,000
what are you doing with the reference 
checking to make sure that he'll hook is

1437
00:58:48,001 --> 00:58:48,840
applied correctly.
No,

1438
00:58:48,841 --> 00:58:53,841
he's not putting in your mouth.
That's such a Goddamn dumb statement 

1439
00:58:53,841 --> 00:58:53,841
statement.
If he,

1440
00:58:53,841 --> 00:58:58,210
if he actually say,
that sucks that he got cut because he's 

1441
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:01,911
always amazing.
You know what every guy wants to be 

1442
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:03,420
because of he doesn't really listen and 
he enjoys it.

1443
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:08,040
He enjoys the reputation of being a guy 
that rips needs a part because he's done

1444
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:10,530
it before,
but he had to get cut.

1445
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:13,260
I understand why Dana condom the condom 
here,

1446
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:16,260
but you got to have that animal back.
Bring them back,

1447
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:21,670
let them suffer for a year and bring 
them back because he's always a threat 

1448
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:21,720
to anybody at time.
Well,

1449
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:23,080
especially at one,
17,

1450
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,500
18,
there's no other guys like that.

1451
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,980
There's no other guys that could jump on
you with heel hooks like that.

1452
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,840
There's nobody that he says sort of 
edema.

1453
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:34,940
Esther was never as dynamic is that dean
lister fought in the UFC a few times.

1454
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:37,400
He'd never had that kind of crazy,
scary performance.

1455
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:38,750
Dean is very,
very good.

1456
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:41,330
Don't get me wrong.
His grappling is world class.

1457
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:42,260
He's.
He's excellent,

1458
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:47,560
but dean never had that kind of started.
Kind of appearance in the UFC were just 

1459
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:49,630
attack someone like a fucking wild 
animal.

1460
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:51,820
He's very explosive and dean wasn't.
No.

1461
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:54,110
Dean was known as a mall or like a 
grizzly bear.

1462
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:59,250
He wasn't known as an explosive.
There were supposed to do a Jujitsu 

1463
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,800
match and I.
I don't think it went down because I 

1464
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,801
think Paula Harris or somebody got hurt,
but I think dean lister would get like 

1465
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:07,880
an intelligent mauler that's a good way 
of scarring.

1466
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,480
Intelligent Mahler.
He's very technical and he just knows 

1467
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:13,480
exactly where to be in the right 
position.

1468
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,290
He's strong as fuck.
He's a beast dude.

1469
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:16,280
He's crazy.
He like,

1470
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,610
he'd always tell me he goes because I 
trained with him and he's always like,

1471
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
no matter what,
like even when I'm feel like I'm in a 

1472
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:25,000
horrible position and he's like,
there's many options here,

1473
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,560
Jeremy.
And sometimes he doesn't even know who'd

1474
01:00:26,561 --> 01:00:28,040
be like go back there again,
do this.

1475
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:29,210
He'll be like,
okay.

1476
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:34,570
And then like he'll just come up with 
something like right there and it'll 

1477
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:37,210
have an escape for it and he's so he's 
such a big dude but he rolls like 125 

1478
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:41,921
pounds a bad motherfucker.
It's a real shame that gene list or had 

1479
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:42,650
to go into mma because like if there 
was,

1480
01:00:42,651 --> 01:00:45,740
I think there should be a real 
professional jujitsu on television,

1481
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:48,110
like on espn the same way they have 
tennis.

1482
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,560
Anything else?
Figuring out how to do like an Abu Dhabi

1483
01:00:51,561 --> 01:00:54,470
style submission only thing.
Put It on TV.

1484
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:59,500
Jujitsu would be for that too.
Maybe maybe to come in the future for 

1485
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,450
like maybe like a UFC Jujitsu and 
submission.

1486
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:05,630
Wrestling would be a solid basis by 
itself.

1487
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,510
I think just by itself.
Jujitsu is still very,

1488
01:01:08,511 --> 01:01:13,511
very exciting and there's some guys that
are just never going to make that 

1489
01:01:13,511 --> 01:01:13,930
transition as striking.
So like we were talking about with um,

1490
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:19,050
with some guys just don't,
they just don't get there and some guys 

1491
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:19,050
do like febreeze,
shiver,

1492
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,560
doom or Damien Maia or what have you.
Or Mark Munoz guys would get better and 

1493
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,820
better at striking and become like a 
dangerous threat on their feet as well.

1494
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,450
But it's be nice to see them just do 
what they're awesome at.

1495
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,420
Like why should a soccer player also 
have to learn how to play baseball?

1496
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,480
You know what I mean?
Or something right in between like 

1497
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:37,480
combat Jujitsu.
It's right in between.

1498
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,180
No striking standing.
It's wrestling standing,

1499
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:40,280
but on the ground you could punch to the
face that makes.

1500
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,870
It's right in the middle between Nogi 
grappling and Nma.

1501
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:49,871
It's not as quite as hardcore as I may,
but it's more exciting because on the 

1502
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:51,070
ground they'd be left stalling because 
you could punch to the face,

1503
01:01:51,071 --> 01:01:56,071
hit Samba guys almost like,
it's almost like old ufc without like 

1504
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:59,171
all,
like maybe the violence that people 

1505
01:01:59,171 --> 01:02:00,851
don't want to see.
So you have like this Russian Zombot 

1506
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:00,851
dude verse in this Brazilian in the 
Olympics.

1507
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,060
I think that'd be incredible.
You know,

1508
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,270
like the wrestling,
the Jujitsu mix,

1509
01:02:04,271 --> 01:02:05,070
you know?
Yes.

1510
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,930
We sick with people,
but they would,

1511
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:12,130
they would cross train,
everybody would cross train and nobody 

1512
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,160
would ever do just Jujitsu versus samba.
Let's just figure this out.

1513
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,740
What style is better?
Everybody would cross train,

1514
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:21,340
you know,
you got to learn another guy's 

1515
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:21,340
techniques as well.
Your cross train but not admitted.

1516
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:21,340
Well,
you know,

1517
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,330
it's really interesting man.
His combat sambo because they're kind of

1518
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:27,090
doing mma,
but then they're also doing judo because

1519
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:32,091
they have like judo Kimonos on.
That's another inbetween Nma and 

1520
01:02:32,091 --> 01:02:33,690
grappling.
That's probably the closest.

1521
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,820
That's what I'm saying,
that those guys would face like a 

1522
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:39,610
Jujitsu guy because back in the early 
days it was like a boxer versus this.

1523
01:02:39,611 --> 01:02:44,611
So if we got this in the Olympics,
I think everybody from some sort of 

1524
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:44,611
grappling with want to be like,
okay,

1525
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:45,640
let's,
let's compete with these people.

1526
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:49,370
Oh yeah.
And the safety level is amazingly high.

1527
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,640
When you think about,
you know,

1528
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,640
the,
the injury rates and Nascar,

1529
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:55,200
the injury rates and fucking Polo,
you know,

1530
01:02:55,201 --> 01:02:57,620
I mean,
dudes get jacked riding horses,

1531
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:00,800
man shows all the time.
Horse races guys fall off,

1532
01:03:00,830 --> 01:03:02,360
break their necks,
gets stomped.

1533
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,070
I mean,
how many of those go a year?

1534
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,420
It's,
it's.

1535
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,300
But you got to know when you've had 
enough.

1536
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:09,320
Right?
For sure.

1537
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,650
That's probably one of the most 
important things for fighter to be aware

1538
01:03:12,651 --> 01:03:17,651
of.
Every fighter in the gym knows at least 

1539
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:17,651
one guy that didn't figure it out.

1540
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:17,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1541
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:18,500
That's,
that's sad.

1542
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:19,940
You know,
he has a lot of heart,

1543
01:03:19,941 --> 01:03:21,650
but at the same time it's kind of 
stupid.

1544
01:03:21,651 --> 01:03:22,850
You know,
like if I,

1545
01:03:22,851 --> 01:03:25,580
if I felt like I was getting knocked out
like three times in a row,

1546
01:03:25,581 --> 01:03:26,380
two times,
you know,

1547
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,950
I would just,
you know,

1548
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,570
pay respect to my family,
you know,

1549
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:32,060
it'd be like,
thank you for letting me enjoy this,

1550
01:03:32,061 --> 01:03:33,110
you know,
and that's not.

1551
01:03:33,111 --> 01:03:34,980
Eventually I would just walk away and 
you know,

1552
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,710
eventually open up a gym or something 
like that,

1553
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:36,890
but

1554
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:39,370
super hard to admit that though the 
guy's done,

1555
01:03:39,371 --> 01:03:40,150
they're always,
I mean,

1556
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:45,210
you know,
as much as anybody that there's always 

1557
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,761
wonders after a loss.
Like if you'd done something 

1558
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:50,521
differently,
would the fight have played out 

1559
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:52,531
differently?
If you were trained with a different 

1560
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:54,031
coach,
would you have been able to see that 

1561
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:54,031
common?
If you had done this differently,

1562
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:54,850
would that have happened and those 
thoughts?

1563
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:55,780
They,
they never,

1564
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,450
they never go away.
You never get to

1565
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,830
natural.
It's natural to fill those thoughts and,

1566
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:05,160
and wonder,
because I actually been being clipped 

1567
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:05,160
before at a.
before that time,

1568
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,820
I just thought I was,
it was almost like a Mike Tyson thing.

1569
01:04:06,821 --> 01:04:11,821
I felt like surreal and they're like,
I could just go in there and brawl and 

1570
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:11,821
just slug it out,
you know?

1571
01:04:11,821 --> 01:04:12,610
Then eventually,
oh,

1572
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:16,260
I actually went to some community,
like bad problems and stuff and uh,

1573
01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:18,030
I got caught by Eve's Edwards,
you know,

1574
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:23,120
he's a great dude.
But honestly I think I could have beat 

1575
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:23,120
them and I could have played that fight 
a lot more different.

1576
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:23,860
I was asking myself,
man,

1577
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,570
you know,
it was,

1578
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,110
you know,
my,

1579
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:26,170
my,
my weak Chin now,

1580
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:31,171
you know,
I've been hit with solid shots but that 

1581
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:31,171
just didn't land.
So finally I just,

1582
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:31,270
you know,
like I just talked to my coaches,

1583
01:04:31,271 --> 01:04:34,180
I talked to a sports psychologist and I 
just pick myself up,

1584
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:35,020
dust myself off.

1585
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,630
I knew I was getting better in the gym 
and the progress,

1586
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,980
it just wasn't there yet.
And again,

1587
01:04:38,981 --> 01:04:41,080
like just,
we started lining things up.

1588
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:46,110
Everything started connecting a lot 
better and I ended up being a better 

1589
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:46,520
fighter from it.
Now if I was continued to going to,

1590
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:47,920
and I still have fun with this dude,
I,

1591
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,600
I'm still learning so much.
I mean,

1592
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:54,750
we could probably roll right now and I'd
probably learn something new or just 

1593
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:54,750
like a different way,
a different route.

1594
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:59,430
So I love that aspect about fighting.
I mean I'm sitting here talking to you 

1595
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,580
Rogan and youtube as well,
so I'm like,

1596
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,750
I'm all pumped up,
you know,

1597
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:03,440
I've never done this if it wasn't for 
like mma.

1598
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:08,470
So it's like changed my life and in the 
moment I stop having fun with it and 

1599
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:09,160
stop learning.
Just like Charles Darwin said,

1600
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:11,870
you know,
you have the most the longest or survive

1601
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:14,680
was the one that to adapt to change.
And uh,

1602
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,280
I just totally agree with that.
There's some young beast is in the UFC.

1603
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,000
I'm a Sergio Pettis.
How old?

1604
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:20,800
That kid?
He just wasn't.

1605
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,070
He just looks sweet.
Awesome.

1606
01:05:23,071 --> 01:05:25,180
You know that that type of talent is 
actually coming in.

1607
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:27,130
So you gotta be able to adapt and 
adjust.

1608
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:30,040
You can't just be the same.
Stand in the pocket type brawler dude.

1609
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:30,360
You got it.

1610
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:33,450
That's what's going to make you great is
that attitude to that being in love with

1611
01:05:33,451 --> 01:05:38,451
the idea of learning things.
And one of the beautiful things about 

1612
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:38,790
mma and you know,
well even in Jujitsu,

1613
01:05:38,791 --> 01:05:41,490
it's like you never run out of things in
Jujitsu,

1614
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:42,930
you never learned that run out of 
techniques.

1615
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:46,740
Now you add striking to that and you 
know,

1616
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:51,800
and then wrestling to that and it's like
there's a never ending ocean of 

1617
01:05:52,831 --> 01:05:53,850
techniques out there.

1618
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:55,160
These are.
Are you throwing,

1619
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,430
are you working on like we'll kicks and 
shit like that.

1620
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:58,620
And spinning back kicks.
Yeah.

1621
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:01,180
Yeah.
I've just seen his videos of him kicking

1622
01:06:01,181 --> 01:06:01,990
the bag.
Oh,

1623
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,860
you're hitting spending back in.
I used to be a,

1624
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,300
I was a taekwondo black belt.
You haven't seen those videos?

1625
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:07,920
No.
No,

1626
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,150
I never.
I never saw myself.

1627
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:10,880
I never knew you did.

1628
01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:12,680
Yeah,
it was before I ever did that.

1629
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:17,510
I used to teach taekwondo for a living 
and won a bunch of taekwondo tournament.

1630
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,300
But seriously,
seriously,

1631
01:06:19,301 --> 01:06:21,200
I'm not just saying this and everybody 
knows this.

1632
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:23,320
Everyone used to think I was kissing his
ass when,

1633
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,880
when,
when I would try to tell people.

1634
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,560
But now there's video.
Now there's proof.

1635
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:32,070
Uh,
I've never seen anybody throw attorney 

1636
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:32,500
inside kick as hard as Joe,
like when he starts this coming up.

1637
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:34,020
Yeah.
You gotta look at the way he is.

1638
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:37,660
He's teaching Jordan George St Pierre.
I think it's earlier than that,

1639
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:43,240
but that's one of the interesting things
about Joyce before this,

1640
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,570
before this,
because this is what he's already asking

1641
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:51,571
to record it.
How'd you get involved involved in like 

1642
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:51,571
fighting man,
you,

1643
01:06:51,571 --> 01:06:52,600
you have such a good grasp on things,
man.

1644
01:06:52,601 --> 01:06:55,960
Like I don't even go to bars and all 
order a paper view dead broke.

1645
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,910
And just a,
just to hear your commentating though.

1646
01:06:58,830 --> 01:06:59,700
Um,
no.

1647
01:06:59,701 --> 01:07:01,180
Well thanks man.
I really appreciate that.

1648
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:06,910
It was a taekwondo guy when I was a kid.
I won the US Open and one of the 

1649
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:08,610
Massachusetts state championship like 
four years in a row.

1650
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:14,170
That.
And then I went from that into 

1651
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:14,170
kickboxing.
I had a three kickboxing bouts,

1652
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,750
but it was doing that all while I was 
still doing standup comedy.

1653
01:07:16,751 --> 01:07:18,730
And then I had,
I had to figure out what to do because I

1654
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:23,731
was starting to lose.
I lost my last fight and I knew I lost 

1655
01:07:23,731 --> 01:07:23,731
because I wasn't in good shape.
I was,

1656
01:07:23,731 --> 01:07:28,411
I was,
I was fucking around too much and doing 

1657
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,421
comedy.
I wasn't focused and I knew I wasn't 

1658
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:32,611
training like I was when I was younger 
so I had to make a big decision in my 

1659
01:07:32,611 --> 01:07:35,731
big decision was abandoned all that,
that whole world and just throw myself 

1660
01:07:35,731 --> 01:07:36,400
into comedy plus there was no money man.

1661
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,200
There was no UFC,
there was nowhere to go.

1662
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:39,380
And then,
you know,

1663
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:44,450
I went from comedy.
I was on a television show called news 

1664
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:47,230
radio and from news radio I watched the 
first UFC when I was there.

1665
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:47,970
It was like,
you know,

1666
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,370
I first saw it and like I think it was 
like probably like 95.

1667
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,180
I probably caught it like year or two 
after it had started.

1668
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,880
I had heard about it and I watched it on
a vhs tape.

1669
01:07:57,881 --> 01:07:58,960
I don't have anything.
I watched the first one.

1670
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:02,320
I think I watched UFC too because I 
think the first one wasn't available for

1671
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:05,320
some reasons or some copyright issues or
what have you.

1672
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:10,321
I don't,
I don't remember what it hit the exact 

1673
01:08:10,321 --> 01:08:10,321
reality was,
but I remember watching the hoists.

1674
01:08:10,321 --> 01:08:10,330
Gracie strangled the fuck out of 
everybody going,

1675
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,480
oh my God.
Like I felt first of all,

1676
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:15,290
all my years of type window,
I was like,

1677
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,400
Oh,
I'm helpless.

1678
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:20,030
Like I thought I was just going to kick 
dudes in the head and I'm like,

1679
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:21,300
I didn't even realize that guy could 
just,

1680
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,810
just manhandled me like that.
So I went to,

1681
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,080
I went to crossing Gracie's place in 
[inaudible] 96.

1682
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:32,110
I started training there.
That was back when Vito was making his 

1683
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:32,110
debut.
They used to call him victor.

1684
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:33,890
He's convicted Gracie.
Like when I,

1685
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,800
when I interviewed him on UFC 12,
I called them Victor Gracie.

1686
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,930
That's crazy.
That's what everybody called him.

1687
01:08:38,931 --> 01:08:41,390
And then he was getting sued by Horian 
or something like that.

1688
01:08:41,391 --> 01:08:44,180
So he had to drop the Gracie name,
but he was taking it because of Carlson.

1689
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:49,810
So that's when I started.
And then I met Eddie and probably like 

1690
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:49,810
98,
I started John jocks.

1691
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:53,250
I met Eddie around there.
And uh,

1692
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:57,380
I started smoking weed about 99,
2000.

1693
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,810
One was,
it kind of knows us before.

1694
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:00,920
Fear factor though.
Yeah,

1695
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,130
that was,
it was 2000.

1696
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:09,360
You had a calm demeanor on there when I 
remember this one time because I knew I 

1697
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,750
wasn't a big fight,
a big fight guy.

1698
01:09:11,751 --> 01:09:15,290
And then just the way there's this guy 
having like this attitude and this crazy

1699
01:09:15,291 --> 01:09:15,830
and you're like,
whoa,

1700
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:16,910
whoa Bro,
like,

1701
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:18,770
chill out.
And then the guy like tried to like fear

1702
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,930
factor one and he just had like a calm,
calm demeanor.

1703
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:21,440
And I was like,
man,

1704
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:22,590
Joe,
Joe's pretty cool dude.

1705
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:24,380
Or you can just tell me like,
man,

1706
01:09:24,381 --> 01:09:25,670
Joe would have messed him up.
Actually,

1707
01:09:25,671 --> 01:09:30,671
you know what that guy was.
I was told about him before we ever did 

1708
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:34,331
the show.
They were telling me that this guy's a 

1709
01:09:34,331 --> 01:09:36,250
kind of a loose cannon.
He attacked a counselor on one show and 

1710
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:36,890
he threw his wife to the ground on 
another show.

1711
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,440
Like he was of day alarm in the show.
It's fun.

1712
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:41,240
It's exciting.
You never know what's going on.

1713
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:46,270
They knew he worked.
Him and his wife were fucking screaming 

1714
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:46,760
at each other.
They were like screaming,

1715
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:52,300
you fucking stupid bitch.
Like it was like there was really 

1716
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,511
entertaining because it was like the 
most dysfunctional and violent 

1717
01:09:55,511 --> 01:09:56,100
relationship I've ever witnessed without
being like.

1718
01:09:56,101 --> 01:10:01,101
They're like,
these motherfuckers screamed at each 

1719
01:10:01,101 --> 01:10:03,041
other and swears and all the time while 
this is going on is this little dude 

1720
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:07,230
from Johnny fairplay from survivor who 
is fucking hilarious the whole time 

1721
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:09,000
they're there screaming,
where's the fucking flashlight?

1722
01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:11,400
Flashlight.
The flashlight.

1723
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:16,520
Fuck Johnny fairplay is is yelling at 
the guy like about the wife telling him 

1724
01:10:20,731 --> 01:10:22,320
you don't need her.
She's dead weight.

1725
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,230
She's ruined it for you.
He's like,

1726
01:10:25,231 --> 01:10:27,630
you don't need or Jonathan,
she's dead weight.

1727
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,680
She's ruined it for you.

1728
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,860
And like he would say that about her.
He would say that about him.

1729
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,650
He was just constantly hackle it 
constantly.

1730
01:10:34,651 --> 01:10:36,900
Haglund like,
you guys got this wrapped up.

1731
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:39,060
You guys got it wrapped up.
Fuck Yo.

1732
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:44,110
Shut up.
She comes back and immediately punches 

1733
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:44,110
this guy,
johnny fairplay.

1734
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:46,290
I mean fucking punches him hard in the 
stomach.

1735
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:48,060
And I said,
hey,

1736
01:10:48,061 --> 01:10:53,061
just because you hit your,
your husband doesn't mean you can hit 

1737
01:10:53,061 --> 01:10:53,061
other people.
You can't just hit people.

1738
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:56,100
And so then he got in my face.
I thought he was gonna hit me.

1739
01:10:56,101 --> 01:11:01,101
So I just grabbed him.
It was like I pushed them away a couple 

1740
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:01,101
times.
They didn't show that.

1741
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:01,920
And then the next thing you know,
I got them in the plum.

1742
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,440
I just held onto his head.
Don't show this man,

1743
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:08,550
always pull it up.
You're so stupid.

1744
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:14,070
It was so stupid.
So he just told that it was a straight 

1745
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,070
hothead and the way you handled it,
I was like,

1746
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,070
this guy obviously has

1747
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,050
some type of martial arts,
like self control,

1748
01:11:16,051 --> 01:11:17,430
you know.
So he's working.

1749
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:21,390
You're working on a lead leg side kick.
I conor Mcgregor.

1750
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,980
You ever do that one?
Oh,

1751
01:11:22,981 --> 01:11:25,260
I mean that's been around a lot more 
since connor mcgregor.

1752
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,680
I want to give him the credit for it,
but I remember way back.

1753
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,820
Yeah,
not too many people.

1754
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:30,920
I mean,
who else?

1755
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:36,810
Who's talking about an mma?
Like who was throwing that lead leg side

1756
01:11:36,811 --> 01:11:41,811
kick?
Like Jon Jon Jones did it on Jones says 

1757
01:11:41,811 --> 01:11:42,480
it to the knee,
which is a very v towards the body.

1758
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:46,110
He's got a legacy to the body and 
dropped me to remember that.

1759
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:51,740
It's cool to see that.
And I also use like a lot of stuff 

1760
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,351
because I trained with Alex Gustafsson 
and he uses a lot of like real trickery 

1761
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,150
stuff.
Like he'll get like hip to hip with you,

1762
01:11:55,151 --> 01:12:00,151
like where you're standing and then 
he'll just go hip to hip and then just 

1763
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:01,110
sweep you and just Kinda Kinda almost 
makes you look stupid.

1764
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:06,240
Dominick Cruz style down on your toes.
I mean he,

1765
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,750
he purposely emulated dominick Cruz.
That's not a coincidence,

1766
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:11,360
right?
That they moved the sign.

1767
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:13,170
Just think he was just light on the same
coaches.

1768
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:15,330
Yeah,
yeah,

1769
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,000
for sure.
But just doing that dance,

1770
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:22,610
is that Eric Delphia?
So he's constantly talking about being 

1771
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:22,610
on your toes,
being athletic,

1772
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:23,590
smart dude,
smart dude.

1773
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:26,460
Very distinct style.
That very distinct.

1774
01:12:26,461 --> 01:12:26,860
I mean,
Shit,

1775
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:32,030
very few people can do that and 
Gustafsson is pulling it off and he 

1776
01:12:32,030 --> 01:12:33,210
moves around like that.
But does it attack enough?

1777
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:35,310
Is Tim Elliot?
Did you see 10 million at this weekend?

1778
01:12:35,311 --> 01:12:35,810
Yeah.
Yeah,

1779
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:37,040
yeah.
Got Great Footwork.

1780
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:38,570
I think best is still yet to come with 
that.

1781
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,600
Yes,
I think so too.

1782
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,700
That kid is stupid.
Strong's from Midwest area.

1783
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:48,840
Was that super prelims?
A little guys?

1784
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,550
Yeah.
I fast forwarded through that one.

1785
01:12:51,551 --> 01:12:53,330
Who'd fight big puncher?
Strong wrestler.

1786
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:58,340
A lot of movement.
You see him definitely being a 35 or in 

1787
01:12:58,340 --> 01:12:58,680
the future that people are going to 
start looking,

1788
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,060
looking at.
I think it'd be 35.

1789
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:01,020
He's there.
Twenty five,

1790
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,200
25.
Yeah.

1791
01:13:02,201 --> 01:13:03,050
Yeah.
Those are flowers.

1792
01:13:03,051 --> 01:13:04,580
A big 25.
Yeah.

1793
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,640
You know,
you know who I'm a fan of 125 pounds 

1794
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:09,640
that I really want.
You know,

1795
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,160
a lot of respect for Demetrius Johnson 
guys.

1796
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,690
Obviously talented but Joseph Benevidez 
Bro.

1797
01:13:12,691 --> 01:13:14,580
I'm a fan of that little bastard,
you know,

1798
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:16,140
gets down bro.
He just,

1799
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,740
he just throws heat the whole time.
It's technically.

1800
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:21,740
I mean he sets things up like I like.
I like istock amazed.

1801
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,390
I've never seen that dude in the boring 
for.

1802
01:13:23,391 --> 01:13:28,391
This is a perfect example of what you 
were talking about before about someone 

1803
01:13:28,391 --> 01:13:28,391
putting together a training camp.
Now they got bang Ludwig,

1804
01:13:28,391 --> 01:13:32,100
who's running their whole camp and he 
runs a Alpha male and uh,

1805
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,750
in um,
San Jose,

1806
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:36,090
Sacramento,
Sacramento,

1807
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:38,790
and all those guys like,
look at Chad Mendez.

1808
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,200
Look at how much better he got from 
there.

1809
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:45,350
They'll look,
look at how much better everybody's 

1810
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:47,391
gotten from,
from that camp and Benevidez and mighty 

1811
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:47,391
mouse.
They're going to have a rematch on Fox.

1812
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:48,060
That's the,
uh,

1813
01:13:48,061 --> 01:13:50,910
the main event on Fox.
And then sacramento,

1814
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:52,170
Danny Castillo,
he,

1815
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,580
he's a,
he's a friend of mine out there.

1816
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:57,330
He's a 55 where he's fighting a,
a good talented striker Barboza.

1817
01:13:57,630 --> 01:14:01,560
So I'm interested to see how Dwayne Bang
and Alpha male come up with a strategy,

1818
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:02,850
you know,
because I like,

1819
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,960
he's a,
he's a good dude.

1820
01:14:03,961 --> 01:14:04,960
You know,
he throws down,

1821
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,510
he's,
he's getting better and you know,

1822
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:09,450
now they have dwayne up.
They're showing a lot of cool stuff that

1823
01:14:09,451 --> 01:14:12,340
I do to vet that strategy for the 
Barboza fight.

1824
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,960
If I had to guess,
probably going to be.

1825
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:15,210
Take that dude down.
Yeah,

1826
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,090
you got to set it up.

1827
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,920
Set it up.
Yeah.

1828
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:23,240
He said he thought he was going to go 
low and then caught them high.

1829
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:26,370
Julie's got that long right hand too.
She.

1830
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,930
She's fucking.
He launches that right hand at you.

1831
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:33,960
Throw,
throws a lot of it and it covers a lot 

1832
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:33,960
of distance to.
Yeah,

1833
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:34,630
it's like almost like a cost check back 
in the day,

1834
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:39,640
but caution with wing his a little bit,
but now you see in guys like throw the 

1835
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,941
straight right hand and catch guys 
before they're able to hit the hook on 

1836
01:14:43,941 --> 01:14:46,831
them.
Catch that Chin sometimes putting put 

1837
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:46,831
dudes asleep.
Yeah.

1838
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:48,400
The Way Varner completes that right hand
is very straight.

1839
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,620
It's very strict.
He landed that all through a set ups.

1840
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:53,050
He was smart that time he immediately 
came out,

1841
01:14:53,051 --> 01:14:55,180
take barboza down,
you know Barboza was going to get up.

1842
01:14:55,181 --> 01:14:57,910
So what does he do that next time acts 
like he's going to go down.

1843
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,190
Of course you got to respect it because 
the guy just took you down.

1844
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:01,570
Boom.
Righthand.

1845
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:03,510
Yeah.
I'm a big fan of Johnny Varner.

1846
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,970
I love a dude who like was the champion 
at one point in time,

1847
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:11,980
was wec champion and then went through a
bad streak where he's losing the guys 

1848
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:15,200
should never lose to lost his motivation
was going back to college and then all 

1849
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,930
of a sudden gets it back together.
He's event man.

1850
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:19,960
Those world class realize you realize 
shit.

1851
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,880
W,
what choice do you have?

1852
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:24,490
You're going to go back to regular life.
You're a superstar.

1853
01:15:24,491 --> 01:15:27,490
You're on TV.
It's right there at your fingertips.

1854
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:29,620
You just got to get a couple training 
camps together.

1855
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,210
Get your shit.
It's right there.

1856
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:36,140
A celebrity status and not waking up and
working at a factory or something.

1857
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,730
You got to keep going.
You got to look at it as like,

1858
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:40,210
you know what?

1859
01:15:40,450 --> 01:15:45,450
Maybe I will.
If you could look at it realistically 

1860
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:48,181
like maybe I won't get the belt,
but I'm going to fucking try my hardest 

1861
01:15:48,181 --> 01:15:49,630
and then in the meantime I'm not going 
to work a regular fucking job.

1862
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:51,910
I'm going to try to parlay this into 
some other shit.

1863
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:57,000
This the excitement they miss that you 
can't have regular days by him.

1864
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,950
Regular Day job.
It's just a slow drone drawn draw.

1865
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,590
I worked and it was just,
it was horrible.

1866
01:16:05,591 --> 01:16:06,720
And you know,
my,

1867
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:08,410
my,
my grandfather had a,

1868
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:10,360
had uh,
told me to quit a job,

1869
01:16:10,361 --> 01:16:11,470
you know what?
I was kind of skeptical.

1870
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:14,020
And then my old,
old girlfriend at the time,

1871
01:16:14,021 --> 01:16:16,630
like I remember one time I had to stay 
at her parents' house just because I was

1872
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,210
believing in this dream and I was just 
starting out.

1873
01:16:19,211 --> 01:16:21,010
I didn't really have much.
I struggled a lot.

1874
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:21,520
And then,
uh,

1875
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,550
I remember her,
her dad was just like,

1876
01:16:23,551 --> 01:16:25,390
you know,
a fight doesn't pay the bills.

1877
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,140
I remember just looking at this guy 
like,

1878
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:29,320
man,
some shit on my dream,

1879
01:16:29,321 --> 01:16:30,760
you know?
What'd you just do?

1880
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:32,890
Okay.
Went away.

1881
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:34,720
Oh,
is it a weird feedback?

1882
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,580
I don't think it was your phone.
Where's your phone?

1883
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,730
Oh,
that what it was.

1884
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:40,810
I thought it was a feedback thing.
Um,

1885
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:45,811
yeah man,
it's a fucking crazy dream to believe 

1886
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:45,811
in,
right?

1887
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:45,811
Yeah,
yeah.

1888
01:16:45,811 --> 01:16:46,020
I mean it's got its ups and downs,
man.

1889
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:48,550
I could imagine like all the crazy crap,
you know,

1890
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:50,600
Varner and like half these guys,
he's probably mad,

1891
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:51,430
you know,
what the hell.

1892
01:16:51,431 --> 01:16:53,140
And he was scared to death.
He admitted it.

1893
01:16:53,190 --> 01:16:56,350
He Barboza I mean,
but especially Barboza.

1894
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:58,780
That guy's a killer dude.
He's like human shit.

1895
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,710
Jimmy Carter said he was shaking before 
foes are coming off of that.

1896
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:05,620
Terry Edom knock out one of the worst 
knockouts ever in the UFC.

1897
01:17:05,710 --> 01:17:08,500
I train with that guy a long time ago 
down in Florida through Hermes,

1898
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:11,360
Franco,
who I was hanging out with a back of the

1899
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,470
day and we went to the armory and,
and uh,

1900
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:18,580
we train with Barboza and I just 
remember it just as more Thai was 

1901
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:18,580
really,
really good.

1902
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,250
And uh,
and I was just like,

1903
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:20,210
man,
what is this guy fight,

1904
01:17:20,211 --> 01:17:20,570
you know,
like,

1905
01:17:20,571 --> 01:17:22,400
this guy should be fighting here,
you know?

1906
01:17:22,401 --> 01:17:23,940
And I was already in UFC at the time 
and,

1907
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:24,950
and I guess they're like,
yeah,

1908
01:17:24,951 --> 01:17:26,540
he's working on his ground or whatever.
And he's,

1909
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,100
he's really good,
good striking.

1910
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:31,380
He's working on his wrestling,
he's explosive athlete and he's a big 55

1911
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:31,940
or two.
Man.

1912
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:33,650
That guy's a beast.
Yeah.

1913
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:34,560
It's uh,
the,

1914
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:39,580
the weight cutting thing is really 
fascinating because when most people 

1915
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,420
hear that a guy who fights at 155 pounds
or you fight it 145 pounds though,

1916
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:43,580
they assume you're actually 145 pounds.

1917
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,250
Yeah.
They're like manual Jesus.

1918
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:47,630
Fuck.
Does that work?

1919
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:53,200
Like I said,
Tyron Woodley is the best example of 

1920
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:53,200
that.
There's no way that dude looks to be 170

1921
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:57,281
pounds dense bro.
I don't know what the hell he always 

1922
01:17:57,281 --> 01:17:58,670
when he gets him and Hector Lombard or 
just going to take over the top.

1923
01:17:58,671 --> 01:18:00,470
I think that's just,
that's just,

1924
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:01,820
that's just what I'm saying.
Hey,

1925
01:18:01,821 --> 01:18:03,830
you know,
that would be an amazing fight.

1926
01:18:03,831 --> 01:18:06,850
Hector Lombard versus tyrone Woodley 
holder.

1927
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:11,890
They're both American top team.
They probably never would find it or 

1928
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:14,720
they wouldn't fight until they became 
absolutely coming back.

1929
01:18:14,740 --> 01:18:15,980
Dude.
Thiago Alves.

1930
01:18:15,981 --> 01:18:18,020
We're probably as soon to see him.
Scrap again.

1931
01:18:18,021 --> 01:18:18,890
Yeah,
I hope so.

1932
01:18:18,891 --> 01:18:20,510
I love that dude.
Great Guy.

1933
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:25,511
Fun To watch sighting fighter.
But he's not an unfortunate series of 

1934
01:18:25,511 --> 01:18:27,670
injury,
back surgery,

1935
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:32,700
you know,
impress the shit on me is donald 

1936
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:32,700
cerrone.
Holy Shit.

1937
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,930
Fight with Evan Dunham.
The coolest thing about that was Evan 

1938
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:36,930
Dunham.

1939
01:18:36,930 --> 01:18:37,880
He,
he,

1940
01:18:37,881 --> 01:18:38,560
uh,
deep.

1941
01:18:38,561 --> 01:18:42,050
Half some perfectly gets on top,
gets the triangle,

1942
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:44,180
escaped the triangle,
goes right into an Omoplata,

1943
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:47,180
gets the Oma plot the sweep width,
the past donaldson.

1944
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:49,310
Ronnie's inside controls.
Just some amazing,

1945
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:51,620
beautiful Jujitsu.
They get back up,

1946
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:57,460
they throw down again.
Dunham ends up on his back again with 

1947
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:00,791
another deep sweep.
He gets on top right into another 

1948
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:02,300
triangle.
But this time he finishes them serious,

1949
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,680
serious Jujitsu.
I heard them talking about going down to

1950
01:19:06,681 --> 01:19:09,010
145 pounds.
And I've actually fought serone.

1951
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,240
And uh,
he ended up breaking my eye orbit in the

1952
01:19:11,241 --> 01:19:12,230
first round.
You know,

1953
01:19:12,231 --> 01:19:14,060
it wasn't like he hit real hard and you 
know,

1954
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:15,500
what I was feeling,
I was feeling as kicks,

1955
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:17,470
but it was just a precise shot.
You know,

1956
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,500
astronomy is more time,
man.

1957
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:19,740
When he's on,
he's on duty.

1958
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:22,910
He's a scary dude.
He's a big dude at 155 pounds.

1959
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:25,400
And for him to go down to 145,
I'm like,

1960
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:26,330
man,
you know,

1961
01:19:26,331 --> 01:19:28,790
I think he's going to do that.
He's so 30 is a big dude.

1962
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:31,940
If he can make it and reload,
reload the right way.

1963
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:33,860
And I imagine that he probably will if 
he has a,

1964
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,570
you know,
he's training with Jackson so he's got a

1965
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:37,580
good camp and good team behind him.
He's going to drop.

1966
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:40,400
I think that was a room I think I read 
somewhere where he said no,

1967
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:42,610
I talked about it,
but it ain't going gonna happen.

1968
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:44,900
Usually people talk about cutting off or
they lose.

1969
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:46,530
He just beat the shit out of Evan 
Dunham.

1970
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:49,940
Sam,
he looked good to window.

1971
01:19:49,941 --> 01:19:54,941
He had a brief window he could have 
pulled out of that triangle where he's 

1972
01:19:54,941 --> 01:19:55,760
taking a little break there and that's 
when you just locked it up.

1973
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,520
Evan Dunham is a tough motherfucker and 
the tap him is even more impressive.

1974
01:20:01,830 --> 01:20:06,830
The train with them when we're dominant 
cruises camp with Uriah Faber when 

1975
01:20:06,830 --> 01:20:08,160
they're are on the show,

1976
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:11,750
we're a team of lance was always over at
drysdales and we've got to change.

1977
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,770
I got a chance to roll with Evan Dunham 
and do it.

1978
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:15,570
He was just.
He was ferocious on the ground.

1979
01:20:15,670 --> 01:20:16,600
Yeah,
his very good.

1980
01:20:16,601 --> 01:20:21,601
That's when he tapped Efrain Escudero.
That was a real wake up call for a lot 

1981
01:20:21,601 --> 01:20:25,021
of people like this kid's ground games.
Right before Evan Denim made his UFC 

1982
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:26,740
debut.
I didn't know anything about them.

1983
01:20:26,741 --> 01:20:28,960
Just one of those dudes you've never 
heard of Gerald to.

1984
01:20:28,961 --> 01:20:30,640
There's a guy named Evan Dunham.
He,

1985
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:34,190
I think he fought.
I forget,

1986
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,270
but he said he's trusted me.
Put all your money on.

1987
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:38,050
I haven't done them.
I just rolled with them all week.

1988
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:41,590
The guys trashed me.
Gerald's awesome.

1989
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,880
But uh,
Evan Dunham.

1990
01:20:42,881 --> 01:20:43,750
So I thought,
okay,

1991
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:44,170
okay.

1992
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:44,830
Leave it.
Yeah.

1993
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,260
When he fought Tyson Griffin,
one of his training partners,

1994
01:20:47,261 --> 01:20:50,740
I thought that was really good because 
Tyson Griffin's real solid on the ground

1995
01:20:50,741 --> 01:20:51,140
too.
And,

1996
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:56,240
and uh,
that fight Dunham was just had this bat 

1997
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,280
control that was crazy and control the 
fight will just fall back control.

1998
01:20:57,281 --> 01:20:59,180
So you know,
on,

1999
01:20:59,190 --> 01:21:00,190
on,
on top point.

2000
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,620
Yeah.
He's very good man.

2001
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:05,880
I just was completely blown away by how 
good serone looked.

2002
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,740
So Ronnie was just on fire

2003
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:09,340
when he's on fire,
he's on fire,

2004
01:21:09,341 --> 01:21:14,341
you know,
I think I think maybe had a little 

2005
01:21:14,341 --> 01:21:15,170
personal issue is that that fight with 
dos Anjos and uh,

2006
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,360
you know,
he just bounced back,

2007
01:21:16,361 --> 01:21:21,361
you know,
in Germany is one of those guys who 

2008
01:21:21,361 --> 01:21:22,591
likes to stay active and get after it.
So it's interesting to see what he's 

2009
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:22,591
going to do.

2010
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:22,591
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,

2011
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,950
that's going to be really interesting.
Um,

2012
01:21:24,951 --> 01:21:26,330
what did you think about the main event?

2013
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:29,220
Me Personally,
I think Hendrick's one,

2014
01:21:29,221 --> 01:21:32,640
I think he completed all,
all of what the octagon rules are about,

2015
01:21:32,641 --> 01:21:33,660
you know,
damage,

2016
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,550
octagon control,
you know,

2017
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,950
what he landed to take downs.
He busted up his face,

2018
01:21:37,951 --> 01:21:42,951
he controlled the fight.
He made it a great fight and almost he 

2019
01:21:42,951 --> 01:21:43,230
almost knocked him out.
And then,

2020
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,010
uh,
you know,

2021
01:21:44,011 --> 01:21:46,140
at the end of the day,
gsp one and that,

2022
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:47,250
that's,
that's the decision.

2023
01:21:47,251 --> 01:21:49,500
But I think,
I think a lot of better things are gonna

2024
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,800
come from that because Dana white and 
immediately calling out these,

2025
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:57,830
these judges and,
and probably getting things going on 

2026
01:21:57,830 --> 01:22:00,201
that end.
So it'll be interesting to see what 

2027
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:00,201
happens.
But I think he needs a rematch.

2028
01:22:00,201 --> 01:22:00,410
The,
I think you're right about,

2029
01:22:00,430 --> 01:22:01,000
um,
the,

2030
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:06,180
the judges.
I think there's also not just the 

2031
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:06,180
judges,
but the,

2032
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:10,300
the judging,
when you look at the scoring system 

2033
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:10,300
that's currently in place is not that 
crazy.

2034
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,430
The judging is not that crazy.
It's not that off at least this fight,

2035
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:17,300
but the scoring system's terrible.
The scoring system is terrible.

2036
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:22,330
It doesn't work when you can have around
like the second round we're Hendrix had 

2037
01:22:22,330 --> 01:22:27,041
GSP and all sorts of trouble and that 
round and the first round or scored 

2038
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:28,070
exactly the same.
They're both 10,

2039
01:22:28,071 --> 01:22:33,071
nine,
one way or another on either judges' 

2040
01:22:33,071 --> 01:22:33,071
scorecard.
That's crazy.

2041
01:22:33,071 --> 01:22:34,490
Those are not the same rounds.
One round.

2042
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:37,460
You had a good struggle that I think,
you know,

2043
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:40,520
one guy did more damage,
but one guy went for a submission.

2044
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:42,410
It's a sort of debatable 10,
nine round.

2045
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:46,310
But the second round was Johnny 
Hendricks clanging.

2046
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:50,390
George has wobbled,
hasn't been all sorts of trouble.

2047
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:54,680
Johnny swarming on him.
How the fuck are those two rounds?

2048
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:58,340
Quantifiably the same.
That's preposterous.

2049
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:02,360
They gotta fix that and if they don't 
fix that big nine,

2050
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,850
eight and seven around that.
But I,

2051
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:10,000
I think this may at least in some way 
motivate the conversation.

2052
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:14,200
I think if time goes on,
if you Ma'am and may last 20 years,

2053
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:19,530
if we're lucky,
they're going to figure out that the 

2054
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,280
system needs to be overhauled and this 
idea of 10 points every round is fucking

2055
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:26,281
silly about where we're acting.
Like there's a thing in place that we 

2056
01:23:26,281 --> 01:23:29,080
have to follow for a new sport and 
that's fucking stupid.

2057
01:23:29,410 --> 01:23:30,040
You don't,
you don't,

2058
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:35,041
you never know.
There's no consistency with these 

2059
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:35,041
judges.
Like you know,

2060
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:36,970
one thing I did not want to do in Brazil
was go to a decision and I was like,

2061
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:41,971
if this is closer and to give it to him.
When I went up and I had a close fight 

2062
01:23:41,971 --> 01:23:45,301
with Sam style,
I thought they're going to give it to 

2063
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:45,301
him.
I was like,

2064
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:45,301
man,
you know what,

2065
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:45,301
you did everything I knew in my heart.
I wanted to fight.

2066
01:23:45,301 --> 01:23:47,060
You know,
thankfully I ended up getting,

2067
01:23:47,061 --> 01:23:50,610
getting that fight,
but don't just fights.

2068
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,460
Yeah,
close fights.

2069
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:53,590
Phil Davis,
I thought be Leo.

2070
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:56,950
Machida two out of three rounds.
I was a very big controversial fight and

2071
01:23:56,951 --> 01:23:58,150
then people were just like,
Nah,

2072
01:23:58,151 --> 01:23:59,110
Leo,
Leo to one.

2073
01:23:59,111 --> 01:24:01,630
You know that decision down there like 
in Brazil.

2074
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:02,710
That's scary,
Bro.

2075
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:03,220
You know,
you're like,

2076
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,270
oh my God,
is he going to get.

2077
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:06,850
Watch that again?
Because I thought that Machita one,

2078
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:10,480
I would have to see it again.
He got the decision,

2079
01:24:10,481 --> 01:24:11,860
but yeah,
that's not a robbery.

2080
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:13,660
You know that.
That's a close fight.

2081
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,750
The problem with the Hendrix GSP fight 
is like,

2082
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:21,751
let's say people that are watching it,
that our mma fans that may not even 

2083
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:21,751
train,
they just enjoy the,

2084
01:24:21,751 --> 01:24:21,810
the,
the,

2085
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:22,900
the fights,
the joy,

2086
01:24:22,901 --> 01:24:25,240
the excitement,
the sport to them.

2087
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,710
GSP got his ass kicked for sure.
It's pretty God damn obvious.

2088
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:34,890
So the only way he didn't get his ass 
kicked as if the scoring systems broken 

2089
01:24:34,890 --> 01:24:37,270
because to the average person,
when you hear what is a fight about is a

2090
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:42,271
fight about touching a guy is a fight 
about putting a guy on his back and 

2091
01:24:42,271 --> 01:24:42,970
winding up on top of them.
What is a fight about?

2092
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:47,320
A fight is about doing damage one way or
another or trying to finish the fight.

2093
01:24:47,321 --> 01:24:50,770
And one guy clearly did that weigh more 
than the other for sure.

2094
01:24:50,771 --> 01:24:52,200
If you didn't have a scratch.
If we're on the

2095
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:55,580
we're on the street and that fight was 
to go down and then you know,

2096
01:24:55,670 --> 01:25:00,670
after awhile everybody breaks it up and 
no matter who's on top of whatever 

2097
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:01,250
happened,
big fight,

2098
01:25:01,251 --> 01:25:02,030
we stand up,
Johnny,

2099
01:25:02,031 --> 01:25:04,070
we stand up just and we're like,
okay,

2100
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,480
we'll give that one to johnny on the 
street.

2101
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:09,010
But also that could.
That could be.

2102
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:14,040
That could happen accidentally.
Someone could hit somebody with an 

2103
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:16,231
elbow,
cut them open real early in the fight 

2104
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:16,231
and even though they dominated the rest 
of the round,

2105
01:25:16,231 --> 01:25:18,020
they looked the worst for rare.
That's fine.

2106
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:18,710
True,
true.

2107
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:19,580
You gotTa,
you gotTa take,

2108
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,370
take in hand,
like what actually went down,

2109
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:23,840
like how was he doing that damage?
What was he doing?

2110
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:26,090
And it looked like johnny was actually 
doing the damage,

2111
01:25:26,091 --> 01:25:27,020
not just,
you know,

2112
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:29,000
he got a lucky punch and as I got 
swollen,

2113
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:30,290
you know,
that that could easily happen,

2114
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,750
but he would just,
he was landing shot after shot,

2115
01:25:32,751 --> 01:25:34,280
you know,
and put it pushing a good,

2116
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:37,660
a good pace where GSP was even wobbled 
and he's just laying on him.

2117
01:25:37,661 --> 01:25:39,830
So I mean obviously you think,
you know,

2118
01:25:39,831 --> 01:25:42,560
if anybody was not even like a fan or 
like your grandma was watching,

2119
01:25:42,561 --> 01:25:43,290
she'd be like,
wow,

2120
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:44,300
yeah,
I think this guy's winning

2121
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:48,430
the most shocked and disappointed guy I 
think maybe I've ever seen after a fight

2122
01:25:48,431 --> 01:25:51,560
with Johny Hendricks Saturday night he 
was Eddie Bravo.

2123
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:52,900
Breathe in.
It's crazy.

2124
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,720
He's going to sleep so good tonight.

2125
01:25:58,770 --> 01:26:03,770
Earlier when it echoed and you got mad 
because I was going to echo his 

2126
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:03,830
breathing.
Make an echo.

2127
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:04,070
So

2128
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,620
that's,
that's ridiculous.

2129
01:26:06,910 --> 01:26:09,680
He accidentally talked and then Shit,
you fucked it up.

2130
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,900
That's ridiculous.
Um,

2131
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:13,460
yeah man.
I think that,

2132
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:14,180
uh,
if you,

2133
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:16,190
if,
if you look at the scoring system that's

2134
01:26:16,191 --> 01:26:18,410
in place and how it's been utilized so 
far,

2135
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,230
I could see the argument.
I don't agree with it,

2136
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:23,330
but I could see the argument that GSP 
won the fight.

2137
01:26:23,570 --> 01:26:28,570
I don't think he won the first round.
Everybody was thinking that he won the 

2138
01:26:28,570 --> 01:26:29,480
first round because he went for the 
submission and got the take down.

2139
01:26:29,481 --> 01:26:34,481
But he,
Johnny did a lot of damage in that 

2140
01:26:34,481 --> 01:26:37,130
round,
fucked his legs up with those needs to 

2141
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:39,341
the legs,
which I don't understand why people 

2142
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:39,341
don't count those.
Like,

2143
01:26:39,341 --> 01:26:39,710
are you,
what are you looking at?

2144
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:41,210
The big strike.
That's like a Charlie horse.

2145
01:26:41,211 --> 01:26:46,211
I don't know if you guys have been hit 
in the leg or like you look at like a 

2146
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:46,211
one of those slug bugs and somebody hit 
you.

2147
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:46,211
You're like,
man,

2148
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:47,450
that's a knee hitting you.
It's a lot harder.

2149
01:26:47,470 --> 01:26:51,140
Just because GSP is not responding 
doesn't mean those are big shots.

2150
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,810
He can tolerate the pain.
It was hard like fuck.

2151
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:56,240
And those are damaging.
They take away your spraying.

2152
01:26:56,450 --> 01:27:01,450
And so in my opinion,
you've got people that should not be 

2153
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:05,650
judging that,
that don't understand what exactly is 

2154
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:08,621
going down.
Johnny did a lot more damage in that 

2155
01:27:08,621 --> 01:27:08,840
route.
He hit him with some hard fucking elbows

2156
01:27:08,841 --> 01:27:12,020
when they were up against the cage.
But George is trying to take him down.

2157
01:27:12,021 --> 01:27:17,021
He had the single johnny hit him with 
some hard fucking elbows and then when 

2158
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:20,741
they were in the clench and johnny was 
when Johnny was bouncing up and down on 

2159
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:21,920
one leg,
he was tagging him with left upper cuts.

2160
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:25,500
Those are all really significant.
The big,

2161
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,130
the takedown in this submission attempt.

2162
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:33,490
It wasn't close enough.
It wasn't like Johnny was screaming and 

2163
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:34,340
beet red and and then he got it out of 
it.

2164
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:36,680
Like you see him on his back and his dad
strangled.

2165
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,830
It wasn't close enough in my opinion.
I gave,

2166
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:41,950
I gave Hendrix that round and yeah,
I,

2167
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:43,170
I,
when I watch it,

2168
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:48,280
when I'm doing commentary and I watched 
as one thing when I watched it again 

2169
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:51,940
afterwards,
that's when I get a sense of what I 

2170
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:51,940
think actually happened.
Didn't happen.

2171
01:27:51,940 --> 01:27:53,660
Sometimes you're doing commentary,
just trying to be entertaining.

2172
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,300
You're all caught up in the moment,
but why?

2173
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,430
Why do you suppose nothing has been 
done?

2174
01:27:58,431 --> 01:28:03,431
I mean,
this isn't the first time we've had a 

2175
01:28:03,431 --> 01:28:03,590
main event and in controversial 
decision,

2176
01:28:03,591 --> 01:28:04,570
like why?
No,

2177
01:28:06,170 --> 01:28:08,570
because the athletic commission has to 
admit that they made a mistake.

2178
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:12,260
Do you believe the theory that uh,
like you really should be the champion?

2179
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:13,010
No.
Like,

2180
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,080
no,
because there's a lot of those ones with

2181
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:16,190
like Frankie Edgar,
Benson,

2182
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,450
Henderson.
I tell them,

2183
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:19,640
I think it's an even fight.
Some people are like,

2184
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:24,670
oh,
you really got to take it from the 

2185
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:24,670
champion and be the champion.
I could see how you got to be,

2186
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:26,450
have a look.
Any decision that's close,

2187
01:28:26,451 --> 01:28:28,190
you're going to have people that see it 
for the other guy.

2188
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:30,830
That's always going to be the case.
And in that way,

2189
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:32,810
the idea of you've got to take it from 
the champion,

2190
01:28:32,811 --> 01:28:37,811
kind of makes sense.
That's the only way it makes sense to 

2191
01:28:37,811 --> 01:28:40,751
convince the people that this is a fair 
and just decision even if you're not 

2192
01:28:40,751 --> 01:28:43,190
happy that the guy that you were rooting
for last,

2193
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,350
you still have to,
you know,

2194
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:48,200
you still have to look at it honestly 
and objectively,

2195
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:51,170
guy got his ass kicked.
That's the fact that you're like,

2196
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,580
okay,
here's a perfect example.

2197
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,190
Second round of Frankie Edgar,
Bj Penn.

2198
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,680
Okay.
The first fight was a clOse fight.

2199
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:59,270
Second fight,
second round,

2200
01:28:59,271 --> 01:29:01,130
second fight.
The first fight was a close fight,

2201
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,280
whereas very debatable.

2202
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,710
Second fight.
Nobody was debating that cranky,

2203
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:05,210
beat,
beat,

2204
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:06,720
beat bj,
period.

2205
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:11,380
So I think when you look out worked on,
he was more motivated.

2206
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:13,530
He was in beTter shape,
pushed to hard pace.

2207
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:17,010
That's a fight where bj penn has fucking
millions of fans.

2208
01:29:17,011 --> 01:29:19,320
they couldn't deny the fact that bj lost
that fight.

2209
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,030
True.
So in that kind of fight,

2210
01:29:21,031 --> 01:29:26,031
yeah,
I could see that's one of those fights 

2211
01:29:26,031 --> 01:29:26,031
where you,
you know,

2212
01:29:26,031 --> 01:29:28,580
you're really taking it to them even 
though frankie was the champion at that 

2213
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:29,010
time.
But I think that you should start even.

2214
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,170
You should start even for sure.

2215
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:32,460
You got it.
You got to earn it.

2216
01:29:32,461 --> 01:29:33,420
Definitely.
And I think,

2217
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:36,570
I think even gsps face a face like a 
told,

2218
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,100
told it all,
you know,

2219
01:29:38,101 --> 01:29:39,360
and uh,
it's crazy.

2220
01:29:39,361 --> 01:29:40,070
You know that actually,
uh,

2221
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:45,080
one of our buddies,
Mike Chandler just fought eddie alvarez 

2222
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:45,310
and a sick fight,
saw that fight and it was just crazy.

2223
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:47,390
Mike waS this going forward?
He's laying in takedowns,

2224
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,610
he's getting out of stuff,
you know,

2225
01:29:48,611 --> 01:29:53,611
and he just controlling these rounds and
then such a close decision where at the 

2226
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:53,760
end of it,
if you look at this,

2227
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:56,540
eddie alvarez is family,
looks worried they're not hugging.

2228
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:59,160
And Michael Chandler is families like,
yeah,

2229
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,870
and you know,
they're thinking confident,

2230
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:02,430
but then boom,
there's this decision.

2231
01:30:02,431 --> 01:30:03,300
You're just like,
whoa.

2232
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:05,460
You got to go back and look at things 
like,

2233
01:30:05,461 --> 01:30:06,110
okay,
well what,

2234
01:30:06,111 --> 01:30:08,630
what happened?
Maybe something I didn't see my bias,

2235
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:09,950
you know,
it's just those,

2236
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:11,670
those crazy fights,
you know,

2237
01:30:11,930 --> 01:30:13,490
I need to watch that fight a second 
time.

2238
01:30:13,491 --> 01:30:15,170
I enjoyed it though.
It was a wild fight.

2239
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:17,080
Chandler is a bad motherfucker,
dude.

2240
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:19,430
He's a beast.
So it's almost like that in the gym.

2241
01:30:19,431 --> 01:30:19,970
Yeah,
there was awful.

2242
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:21,930
So you think nothing.
Nothing changes.

2243
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:24,960
Because then that would mean the 
commission would have to admit they made

2244
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:25,580
a mistake.
Yes.

2245
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:26,930
If you.
if you change things,

2246
01:30:26,931 --> 01:30:28,850
you have to admit that you should have 
changed things.

2247
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,740
I have To admit that if you are running 
things,

2248
01:30:30,741 --> 01:30:33,860
if this is the correct way to do things,
why didn't you do this 18 months ago?

2249
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:36,530
Why didn't you do this two years ago?
Why didn't you do this five years ago?

2250
01:30:36,770 --> 01:30:41,770
You've been licensing nma for so long 
and people have been complaining about 

2251
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:42,100
things for so long,
but you've.

2252
01:30:42,101 --> 01:30:44,090
You've done the same shit over and over 
again.

2253
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,190
That's so then that's probably never 
going to change.

2254
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:51,870
That's like the definition of insanity.
Doing the same thing over and over 

2255
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:51,870
again,
expecting different results.

2256
01:30:52,030 --> 01:30:55,160
They can have people that are untrained 
as judges

2257
01:30:55,430 --> 01:31:00,430
better or worse for the the casinos,
the people that are taken.

2258
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:06,760
Is it better or worse if there is a 
logical reasonable scoring system or if 

2259
01:31:07,101 --> 01:31:08,930
there's a fucked up one,
what's better?

2260
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:10,340
What do you think is better for them?

2261
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:10,940
Well,
if this,

2262
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:16,090
if the kids see,
knows are on the board in everything is 

2263
01:31:16,090 --> 01:31:19,541
on the square than you know the house is
always going to win and almost every 

2264
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:22,100
game right when it comes to gambling on 
fights,

2265
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:27,490
they're pretty smart.
I'm sure they get really good odds 

2266
01:31:27,490 --> 01:31:29,981
makers.
There was a few lines that I didn't 

2267
01:31:29,981 --> 01:31:32,051
like.
I gave a few of my friends that were 

2268
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:33,911
betting.
I told them what I thought were like 

2269
01:31:33,911 --> 01:31:35,230
good bats and not good bets,
but I think that ultimately the experts 

2270
01:31:35,241 --> 01:31:37,700
of mma are,
you're not gonna be able to fool them.

2271
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:41,300
They know who's going to win or they 
have a 70,

2272
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:44,510
80 percent chance that who's going to be
way better than 51 percent.

2273
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:47,720
If the house is a 51 percent chance or 
54 percent,

2274
01:31:47,721 --> 01:31:51,890
whatever it is in blackjack and mma 
expert has a way better.

2275
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:53,240
You know,
if you're gambling,

2276
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:55,050
like if you were gambling on fines,
shit,

2277
01:31:55,070 --> 01:32:00,070
you're going to be 80 percent right now.
You think about 80 percent when you 

2278
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,070
guess

2279
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,220
sometimes I get them all wrong,
but let.

2280
01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:07,240
Let'S.
Do you think there's ever been a point 

2281
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:09,760
in time in las vegas where they see the 
people that are running the casinos,

2282
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:14,761
who the fuck knows who they are,
have something to do with the 

2283
01:32:14,761 --> 01:32:17,680
commission,
like they're tied in somehow and uh,

2284
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,560
at there was a fight.
Do you thiNk ever that the,

2285
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,760
the,
the casinos made a decision happened 

2286
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,040
because they didn't want to lose a 
certain amount of money?

2287
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:28,420
Who,
that's all speculation.

2288
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:31,180
Who knows if that ever happens?
I don't know.

2289
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:33,940
I'll tell you what I'm.
One thing I do know about casinos,

2290
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:37,690
like they're not stupid.
They catch people counting cards.

2291
01:32:37,780 --> 01:32:40,300
They get rid of them if they catch 
people doing things.

2292
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:43,090
Like here's a perfect example,
professional pool.

2293
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:45,160
They've never had a line on professional
pool.

2294
01:32:45,161 --> 01:32:50,161
You know why?
because they had a line on professional 

2295
01:32:50,161 --> 01:32:52,531
pool wants and the underdog was this 
dude named mike lebraun to win this big 

2296
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:56,941
tournament.
And so they dumped the shit out of this 

2297
01:32:56,941 --> 01:32:56,941
dude.
Everybody dumped to the dude,

2298
01:32:56,941 --> 01:33:01,500
meaning everybody quit.
They played shitty on purpose and let 

2299
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,160
this dude when and they get all their 
money on this guy winning.

2300
01:33:03,370 --> 01:33:07,210
So everybody just had his just driving 
balls straight into the rail.

2301
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:09,580
They're missing the pocket book inches 
on purpose,

2302
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:12,970
totally on purpose,
obviously on purpose and the other one

2303
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:16,070
dude casino,
it's trial and error and those,

2304
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:16,850
uh,
you can't,

2305
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:21,970
you can't actually denied a casino.
It's just like the people that are out 

2306
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:27,100
there that are highly elite people,
they know how to make good decisions no 

2307
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:28,490
matter what it is that they're winning 
for a reason.

2308
01:33:28,491 --> 01:33:33,491
That's because they're making good 
decisions and taking advantage of those 

2309
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:33,491
people that are trying to cut,
cut this.

2310
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:36,480
Do you think there might be a crazy 
conspiracy where like the people running

2311
01:33:36,481 --> 01:33:41,481
the casinos have something to do.
Like every now and then they make the 

2312
01:33:41,481 --> 01:33:41,910
call and they go,
that motherfucker loss no matter what.

2313
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
If it's close,
you think there's anything like that or 

2314
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,930
you go to the casino,
they play their odds.

2315
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:51,780
Very good.
Someone always making for some,

2316
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:56,900
for,
for a judge to get paid off to do this 

2317
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:56,900
or that.
There's got to be someone with power.

2318
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,220
It's the math that people don't 
understand.

2319
01:33:58,221 --> 01:33:59,960
That's why those people that are 
counting cards,

2320
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:05,140
they understand a portion of the math.
You got to think those people are at an 

2321
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,471
elite level and are always winning 
Because of their decision making so 

2322
01:34:08,471 --> 01:34:11,591
their.
Their science and their math skills are 

2323
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:13,490
way better than you are so they can see 
these small little snakes in the grass.

2324
01:34:13,491 --> 01:34:18,491
If that's what you want to call them,
like dirt bag trying to scheme on your 

2325
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:18,491
money.
Imagine if like that.

2326
01:34:18,491 --> 01:34:20,780
That's yours and you see this little rat
over here playing a little game.

2327
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:22,560
You just want to go up and smack him.
Like,

2328
01:34:22,580 --> 01:34:23,090
bro,
you're cheating,

2329
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:24,350
cheating.
It's.

2330
01:34:24,351 --> 01:34:27,350
He's just good at it.
It's so stupid that you can't count.

2331
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,420
He caught onto the science of the math.
You know what I mean?

2332
01:34:29,421 --> 01:34:30,680
How crazy is that?
They tell you,

2333
01:34:30,681 --> 01:34:32,780
you can't be really good at this.
You can't.

2334
01:34:32,781 --> 01:34:34,430
You can't be good at it.
You can't,

2335
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:36,690
can't figure it out.
They're playing it to the.

2336
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:38,090
To the people that are juSt like,
man,

2337
01:34:38,150 --> 01:34:39,000
am I goIng to get lucky?
Lucky.

2338
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:40,010
Imagine that,
man.

2339
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:43,910
it's like only fighting guys.
You can absolutely be like,

2340
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:46,350
could you imagine you would.
You'd never get a title shot.

2341
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,570
Like the idea is ridiculous.
Anybody who's.

2342
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:51,510
It's not like the battle between the 
card counters in the casinos.

2343
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:53,250
That should never goes down.
It's not really.

2344
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:58,810
You know,
they make sure those guys can't work 

2345
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:58,810
like,
nah,

2346
01:34:58,810 --> 01:34:58,810
sorry,
we're just here to steal.

2347
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:00,980
We're just here to extract it.
We're not here to gamble.

2348
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,680
To actually gamble or something.
Been gambling.

2349
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:05,430
When a guy gets like really good at 
poker,

2350
01:35:05,431 --> 01:35:08,610
are really good at blackjack and see 
kind of becomes like things.

2351
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:11,740
Those dudes just make money man.
Really best dudes.

2352
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,760
They make money.
They make a big risk.

2353
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:18,840
Yeah.
They lose a little bit here in the 

2354
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:20,500
again,
but for the most part they wind up 

2355
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:22,841
ahead.
There's a lot of those guys that are 

2356
01:35:22,841 --> 01:35:22,841
like professionals.

2357
01:35:22,841 --> 01:35:25,700
What do they.
What happens is these guys just get 

2358
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:27,381
funded.
Are they just playing in a basement 

2359
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:29,031
where these dudes come from?
It's crazy because they just see this 

2360
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:29,031
guy on tv.
You're like,

2361
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:29,490
man,
does this guy even know anything?

2362
01:35:29,491 --> 01:35:32,630
But all of a sudden it shows like the 
chip or the money count and you're like,

2363
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,110
this dude's

2364
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,040
well,
think about it.

2365
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:37,020
THink about how much money it would 
mean,

2366
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:40,990
how much time and effort you put in to 
get really good at mma.

2367
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:46,500
Now think about someone who's doing the 
same thing with card counting or with 

2368
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,771
poker.
They're just constantly playing moves 

2369
01:35:49,771 --> 01:35:49,930
over there.
You ever see like poker dorks talk,

2370
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:53,350
give her like have a poker door 
conversation with people when they start

2371
01:35:53,351 --> 01:35:58,351
talking about night.
I had five night and he pulls king six 

2372
01:35:58,351 --> 01:35:58,370
and I flopped with.
Yeah,

2373
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:01,090
it has like a pig latin.
What the fuck is saying?

2374
01:36:01,091 --> 01:36:02,890
But,
but to them it's just,

2375
01:36:02,891 --> 01:36:05,590
it's almost like a chest thing.
Felt like they're going over the moves.

2376
01:36:05,591 --> 01:36:05,950
They're like,
oh,

2377
01:36:05,951 --> 01:36:07,750
I see.
Well why didn't you fold?

2378
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:08,590
You know,
like why didn't you,

2379
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:10,390
why didn't you do this?
Why didn't you do this?

2380
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:12,610
and they're,
they're going over positions.

2381
01:36:12,611 --> 01:36:14,830
And I got a bad roll of the cards and 
you know,

2382
01:36:16,470 --> 01:36:18,300
I believe in the role of the card is all
you ever.

2383
01:36:18,330 --> 01:36:20,730
You ever sat down like on like a,
what is it,

2384
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:25,790
like a black jack table and then that 
person's always hitting when they 

2385
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:25,790
shouldn't be hitting or not hitting and 
you're just like,

2386
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:30,680
I gotta get up,
I just lost 75 bucks to realize this 

2387
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:30,680
guy's an idiot and he's messing up the 
whole table.

2388
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:34,881
But you get on that table and you're 
just hitting in your role and you're 

2389
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:37,581
slapping high fives with some person 
from Arizona you don't even know and 

2390
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:37,581
you're just killing it.
So it's,

2391
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:37,581
it's crazy

2392
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,770
playing that to me.
How does it see,

2393
01:36:39,771 --> 01:36:44,771
I don't know gambling.
So if we're all playing say you mean 

2394
01:36:44,771 --> 01:36:47,591
eddie,
you're playing blackjack together and 

2395
01:36:47,591 --> 01:36:47,591
eddie gets crazy and he just fucking 
said he hits.

2396
01:36:47,591 --> 01:36:50,990
He's a hiT me.
I got this is a fucking bitch.

2397
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:54,630
Say I have like a low car,
like I'm at like a nine and he's hitting

2398
01:36:54,631 --> 01:36:57,690
on a 16 to try to get to 21 because he 
wants to beat the guy.

2399
01:36:57,691 --> 01:36:59,990
You know you're supposed to let that 
just pass and let let,

2400
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,120
let me go ahead and hit,
hit and hit the bigger number instead.

2401
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:05,670
He'll bust and ruined my car.
Next thing you know,

2402
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:07,560
like all hit like two little cards and 
I'm like okay,

2403
01:37:07,561 --> 01:37:10,290
I'm at like a a 12,
but they're showing like a 15,

2404
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,840
16 to.
I got a hit and then boom I,

2405
01:37:12,841 --> 01:37:14,730
boston,
it just kind of just goes down the line.

2406
01:37:14,731 --> 01:37:17,400
But if you get the people that are 
hitting on the right cars,

2407
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:19,530
that'll actually funkshway and flow

2408
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,600
really.
It doesn't make any sense.

2409
01:37:21,601 --> 01:37:24,360
It seems like he's making his decisions.
You're making your decisions.

2410
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:30,430
Commercials.
The guy goes downstairs and they score 

2411
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:30,430
scoring.
Know

2412
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:31,010
dante using like five decks now.
They're like five days.

2413
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:32,810
I don't even know how many they use.
They use a Bunch.

2414
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:37,830
You,
they have that big machine that like 

2415
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:37,830
just like.
So

2416
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:39,960
the way you're looking at it as if he 
gets a five that you could have used and

2417
01:37:39,961 --> 01:37:42,530
he busts because that five he fucked 
you.

2418
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:45,540
You have had that five and you would 
have had 20 or something.

2419
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:46,250
YeP.
And he would.

2420
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:48,650
And he might've been.
Then the dealer might have busted and he

2421
01:37:48,651 --> 01:37:50,910
could actually one,
but he actually hit the wrong card.

2422
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:52,160
Trying to be greedy too soon.

2423
01:37:52,260 --> 01:37:55,050
I think that's not a good way of looking
at it.

2424
01:37:55,610 --> 01:37:56,040
I think

2425
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,980
that's like a defeatist logic because it
doesn't make any sense.

2426
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:01,410
Like you look,
the numbers are the numbers.

2427
01:38:01,411 --> 01:38:03,450
If you have 15 and you hit,
you know,

2428
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,960
you know what the consequences are.
If you have 17 and you hit your crazy,

2429
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:12,050
there's some good ones that you're 
supposed to hit on and that they tell 

2430
01:38:12,050 --> 01:38:12,640
you not to hit on.
And sometimes the dealer if you'd like,

2431
01:38:12,641 --> 01:38:17,641
you don't really know what you're doing.
You're just starting out and they'll be 

2432
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:17,641
like,
you sure you want to do that?

2433
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:21,510
You know,
but they can't tell you but they'll ask 

2434
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:21,510
you and stop you.
Which is pretty cool because I.

2435
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:25,101
What if you don't know you're doing just
blacked out drunk and you're making all 

2436
01:38:25,101 --> 01:38:25,101
stupid bets.
Solution money.

2437
01:38:25,101 --> 01:38:26,560
Well I would imagine too that if you're 
a card counter,

2438
01:38:26,561 --> 01:38:31,561
it would actually help you to have 
someone who's betting all fucking wacky 

2439
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:33,850
next to you because you know that he got
that certain card,

2440
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:37,540
like key.
Instead of like him folding or holding,

2441
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:42,120
he actually added additional information
into the equation he gave you like,

2442
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:43,630
oh,
the seven just got used,

2443
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,030
so now you have an extra number that you
can eliminate.

2444
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,220
You know whaT I mean?
I mean,

2445
01:38:47,230 --> 01:38:52,230
it seems to me that playing with idiots 
would be beneficial if you have the 

2446
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:52,540
right attitude.
It could possibly work out.

2447
01:38:52,541 --> 01:38:53,980
Yeah.
I guess if you're a card counter,

2448
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:55,930
if you're a really good card counting,
and again,

2449
01:38:55,931 --> 01:38:57,940
I don't understand how the fuck card 
county works,

2450
01:38:57,941 --> 01:38:58,430
so I'm just talking.

2451
01:38:58,670 --> 01:39:00,490
There's a movie about it,
but I still never.

2452
01:39:00,570 --> 01:39:03,380
It's hard math and math.
Ed norton,

2453
01:39:03,410 --> 01:39:04,130
right?
Yeah.

2454
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:07,050
It's a crazy.
It's a crazy math to it that.

2455
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:08,940
No,
no.

2456
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:10,050
I think it was a.
No,

2457
01:39:10,051 --> 01:39:12,830
that's.
That's a rob the casino.

2458
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:18,070
They robbed the casino.
Was there a card counter in those 

2459
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:18,070
movies?
Now?

2460
01:39:18,070 --> 01:39:19,470
There's a lot of others.
There's a lot of those.

2461
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,900
Louise,
the were the dude.

2462
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:26,320
Vegas figures out all these genius.
Whether the movie wasn't with a bunch of

2463
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:28,200
genius card counters.

2464
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:33,350
Does the college that they would.
Then the guy takes him there and he 

2465
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:33,390
wasn't supposed to Be in the building.
Yeah,

2466
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:36,420
you guys want to do this?
They all got a suite together.

2467
01:39:36,421 --> 01:39:38,350
They're rolling around in cash and it 
all goes bad.

2468
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:43,430
Eddie bravo cards.
Would you rob the system where if you,

2469
01:39:45,090 --> 01:39:50,090
if you do a little bit like say you knew
the math and you just sit down and 

2470
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:50,090
you're like,
you know what else?

2471
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:50,730
I just want a couple extra hundred.
Let's real quick,

2472
01:39:50,731 --> 01:39:55,731
you know,
and then you would you sit down and do 

2473
01:39:55,731 --> 01:39:55,731
it.
Don't be scared of a system.

2474
01:39:55,731 --> 01:39:59,720
But I didn't realize that I was an idiot
and I was going to try to make some 

2475
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,030
money and taco and then realized,
oh shit.

2476
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:02,520
How much did you lose before you figured
ouT?

2477
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:07,500
Well it's just,
it's like 21 and roulette.

2478
01:40:08,140 --> 01:40:10,050
There'S reddit.
You can just bet red and black.

2479
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:15,051
You could put chips on the numbers or 
you could just put chips on red and 

2480
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:15,051
black.
So I figured,

2481
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,920
I figured that if you put a,
you know,

2482
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:17,870
if you had a.
Yeah,

2483
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:21,900
I have a lot of cash to put $500 on red.
If you lose,

2484
01:40:21,990 --> 01:40:26,990
you just keep putting.
You keep doubling it until finally read 

2485
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:31,130
hits.
But you got to have a lot of money to 

2486
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:31,130
double.
But there's a limit.

2487
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:31,560
So they already figured that out a long 
time ago.

2488
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:33,660
So they limit you that you can do that 
shit.

2489
01:40:33,661 --> 01:40:38,661
So I thought I had it.
I didn't realize that they already 

2490
01:40:38,661 --> 01:40:38,661
figured it out.
So I'm in,

2491
01:40:38,661 --> 01:40:38,850
I'm going to do this shit.
I'm just gonna.

2492
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:41,550
I'm just gonna win once when 500 bucks 
and I'm done.

2493
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:44,440
That can be an expensive method though.
you better come in with some staff.

2494
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:47,830
You've got to have like $10,000
if you hit that,

2495
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,680
I'd be so awesome.
He's like walk away.

2496
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:50,930
Yeah,
you got to walk with.

2497
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:54,160
The key is to walk away when you your 
$500 back.

2498
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,190
So everybody's thought this through.
It's hilarious.

2499
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,760
How many conversations have been had 
across the country?

2500
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:03,160
People figuring bro.
I was telling people I got it bro.

2501
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:04,930
I got it,
but I'm not going to get crazy.

2502
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:08,140
It's just going to be $500 a day.
It's a system to get you could.

2503
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:11,370
You could live nicely just once a day.
He just got up.

2504
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:13,870
What's interesting,
if you want $500 a day,

2505
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:18,871
they would fucking kick you out.
They'd be like you to keep switching 

2506
01:41:18,871 --> 01:41:18,871
casinos,
bro.

2507
01:41:18,871 --> 01:41:19,000
Yeah.
That's the move.

2508
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:20,650
right?
But don't keep winning.

2509
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:24,040
Did they offer you stuff to keep you in 
that environment for the hotel?

2510
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:28,960
Might bring some pretty girls over to 
and they give you a bottle of champagne.

2511
01:41:28,961 --> 01:41:32,100
Like you're the man broke two days.
I love vegas.

2512
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:37,110
I love the idea behind vegas.
Just let people do whatever the fuck 

2513
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:37,110
they want.

2514
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:37,110
Let him gamble.
Let a decision may open.

2515
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:41,560
Stay open 24 hours a day with alcohol.
Fuck yeah,

2516
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:43,000
I like it.
I like vegas.

2517
01:41:43,001 --> 01:41:46,910
I liked the freedom of vegas.
you need people like some seedy parts of

2518
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:49,990
the seedy parts everywhere.
If you get 100 people together,

2519
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:52,060
one of them is going to suck.
It's good to have fights.

2520
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:56,340
They're too big.
It's too hot to live though to be.

2521
01:41:56,470 --> 01:42:01,470
If you were like rolling ball and like 
carrot top and you had some giant 

2522
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:01,490
mansion and henderson,
you know,

2523
01:42:01,491 --> 01:42:04,930
you keep your bitches doesn't pull his 
fucking.

2524
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:06,790
Is he rich?
Fuck,

2525
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:10,450
are you kidding?
He's not like corey feldman.

2526
01:42:10,451 --> 01:42:11,880
No,
he's got a.

2527
01:42:12,070 --> 01:42:15,090
He's got a long standing show in vegas 
at the luxor,

2528
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,010
so he's got like 10 million carrot.
Top has been performing celebrity in our

2529
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:23,880
store for all the law.
It was like a vanilla ice cutting.

2530
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,270
No way.
Dude.

2531
01:42:25,271 --> 01:42:30,271
Countertop has been a successful 
performer in vegas for more than a 

2532
01:42:30,271 --> 01:42:30,271
decade.
He's been killing it,

2533
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:33,820
killing it in vegas for a decade and he 
puts on a great show.

2534
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:35,890
You know,
a lot of people give carrot top a lot of

2535
01:42:35,891 --> 01:42:36,880
shit.
But look,

2536
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:40,060
there's people that like the monkeys and
there's people that like slayer,

2537
01:42:40,150 --> 01:42:45,150
right?
Everybody's got their own thing they 

2538
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:45,150
enjoy and if you'd like that kind of 
comedy,

2539
01:42:45,150 --> 01:42:49,530
carrot tops a funny dude and he's 
basically essentially taken over that 

2540
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:50,560
entire market.
What exactly does he do?

2541
01:42:50,561 --> 01:42:52,720
Magic prop comment.
She's a prop comedian.

2542
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:54,550
Brings out a bunch oF prompts.
They used to.

2543
01:42:54,551 --> 01:42:58,120
They used to be a style prop prop comedy
used to be a style of comedy.

2544
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:01,300
It was like puppet guys who eventual 
requests those guys,

2545
01:43:01,450 --> 01:43:04,210
those guys who would do impressions and 
there was prop comics.

2546
01:43:04,211 --> 01:43:09,211
There was like a style of comedy and 
it's not anymore because carrot top was 

2547
01:43:09,211 --> 01:43:09,211
so dominant.

2548
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:14,310
he was so big.
Was the biggest prop comic of 

2549
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:14,310
autologous.
A prop comic.

2550
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:17,850
Yeah,
but gallagher is like a a fake prop 

2551
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:17,850
comic,
like smashes fruit and shit.

2552
01:43:17,850 --> 01:43:18,870
It's a little different.
He has,

2553
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:24,060
I shouldn't say fake.
I would say he's got his own branch of 

2554
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:24,060
prop comedy,
but he owns as well.

2555
01:43:24,060 --> 01:43:25,930
if you went on stage and try to smash 
watermelons,

2556
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:26,950
they'd be like,
bitch,

2557
01:43:26,951 --> 01:43:29,710
are you fucking kidding me?
You can't steal from him.

2558
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:32,770
Gallagher's shit.
You can't smash fruit.

2559
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:33,640
What aBout andrew?
DIce?

2560
01:43:33,641 --> 01:43:36,220
Clay is hilarious.
the man,

2561
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:38,050
he still does.
He still make a lot of money.

2562
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:42,400
He never really.
He just had the swagger of just coolness

2563
01:43:42,401 --> 01:43:42,940
around him.
You know?

2564
01:43:42,941 --> 01:43:45,780
He just lives.
We've had podcasts a couple times now.

2565
01:43:45,830 --> 01:43:48,940
Went to see him in vegas.
I saw him back in his height live,

2566
01:43:48,941 --> 01:43:49,840
man.
That was a massive,

2567
01:43:50,020 --> 01:43:54,420
where it was a big play there,
pacific amphitheater or so,

2568
01:43:54,620 --> 01:43:56,480
orange county during the height.

2569
01:43:56,550 --> 01:44:01,550
Oh my god.
And then did some insane amount of 

2570
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:01,830
theaters across the country with more 
than any comedian.

2571
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:07,140
Yeah.
He's probably the most successful 

2572
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:07,140
comedian of all time.
Like as far as money.

2573
01:44:07,190 --> 01:44:08,660
Oh,
George Lopez.

2574
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,220
Cool dude.
At the right time.

2575
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:12,350
He just came through the right era and 
just smashed it.

2576
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:15,590
He just had the perfect act.
He had an act that you could play back.

2577
01:44:15,650 --> 01:44:19,220
That was the thing about is act like you
didn't mind if you knew the jokes.

2578
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:24,340
It's almost like music,
like if you want to go see the rolling 

2579
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:24,340
stones,
you don't want to have your new song,

2580
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:24,430
bitch.
Come on,

2581
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:27,610
get it out of the waY.
You've got new song.

2582
01:44:29,520 --> 01:44:30,740
I want to hear.
Stop me up.

2583
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:35,790
You know,
back to the classic comedy comedy 

2584
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:39,580
comedy.
You have to have new shit except dice 

2585
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:39,580
clay.
Dice clay.

2586
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:40,280
What's in the bowl?
Bitch?

2587
01:44:41,660 --> 01:44:45,330
The whole crowd would sing it along as 
if they were like,

2588
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:48,630
yeah,
it's a different candidate.

2589
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:53,840
It was a different thing.
He figured out something different or 

2590
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:53,960
stumbled upon something different,
but that's something different.

2591
01:44:53,961 --> 01:44:56,510
Became massive.
People wanted to see those rhymes.

2592
01:44:56,511 --> 01:44:59,270
They want them to hear those rhymes.
Little boy blue.

2593
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:04,330
Oh,
he needed the money and the whole crowd 

2594
01:45:04,330 --> 01:45:06,800
would sing it along.
What's his act like nowadays?

2595
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:11,801
I haven't heard a.
He almost seemed like he was just 

2596
01:45:11,801 --> 01:45:11,801
keeping it real.
He doesn't give a fuck.

2597
01:45:11,801 --> 01:45:12,830
He's.
He's worth a ton of money.

2598
01:45:12,831 --> 01:45:17,831
He's got a hot wife.
He is very few people that legitimately 

2599
01:45:17,831 --> 01:45:21,311
don't give a fuck.
Andrew dice clay legitimately doesn't 

2600
01:45:21,311 --> 01:45:21,311
give a fuck.
It's still smokes.

2601
01:45:21,311 --> 01:45:22,380
A ton of cigarettes.
Still wears rest,

2602
01:45:22,430 --> 01:45:27,430
fucking weightlifting gloves and cut off
sleeves and whereas a nice fannY pack 

2603
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:28,670
prompts,
I learned about the roots fanny pack for

2604
01:45:28,671 --> 01:45:28,850
him.

2605
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:31,650
It's an excellent choice.
If you're going to get leather.

2606
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:36,010
Fanny pack doesn't give a fuck.
I love ford failing.

2607
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:41,020
I was such a big andrew dice clay fan 
that ford fairlane was still one of my 

2608
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:41,020
favorite movies.
I love that.

2609
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:42,620
Fucking loves.
Last time You saw his comedy,

2610
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,380
long time ago too,
we saw him.

2611
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,620
We saw him about two years ago in vegas.
Was a year ago,

2612
01:45:48,621 --> 01:45:50,100
two years ago,
was about a year ago.

2613
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:54,290
Did you ever ask them about what the 
reasoning behind that?

2614
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,660
The day the laughter died,
what was that about?

2615
01:45:56,740 --> 01:45:59,930
Like I didn't give a fuck.
He went on stage anD he was like decided

2616
01:45:59,931 --> 01:46:01,250
that he was too big or something like 
that.

2617
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:06,251
So he went on stage at danger fields and
decided to just talk nonsense for two 

2618
01:46:06,251 --> 01:46:10,280
our jokes and then release it as a dvd 
and it did great.

2619
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:13,340
So fucking hundreds of thousands of 
copies.

2620
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,860
It was a joke.
It was what he wanted to do.

2621
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,280
He just wanted to do whatever they call 
it.

2622
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:19,990
The dAy the laughter died.
She did die.

2623
01:46:20,030 --> 01:46:25,030
He did whatever the fuck you wanted to 
do and what he wanted to do was just 

2624
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:27,881
show up and start recordIng shows where 
he just starts talking and maybe comes 

2625
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:30,020
up with jokes and maybe not.
Some of the things were funny,

2626
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,450
like you'd get something funny.
Really 15,

2627
01:46:32,630 --> 01:46:34,280
20 mInutes.
I took that seriously,

2628
01:46:34,281 --> 01:46:34,740
man,
I,

2629
01:46:34,810 --> 01:46:36,170
I,
I didn't get it.

2630
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:39,470
I think I was like 22.
I didn't get it.

2631
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:41,300
I took it seriously.
I thought it was,

2632
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:44,570
it was just,
he just sucked on purpose.

2633
01:46:45,350 --> 01:46:50,350
I think he got so big.
I don't think you nor I nor anyone in 

2634
01:46:50,401 --> 01:46:54,330
this room could ever imagine what it's 
like to be that famous when.

2635
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:56,940
And this was famous before the internet,
so it was a weird fame,

2636
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:57,790
you know,
it was a,

2637
01:46:58,130 --> 01:46:58,680
you know,
like,

2638
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,630
people couldn't believe there are seeing
you.

2639
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:04,170
There's a lot more exclusive as famous.
Everybody knows that.

2640
01:47:04,171 --> 01:47:07,380
I don't know how you go through life.
Everywhere you go,

2641
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,960
people are going,
they're fucking joe rogan everywhere.

2642
01:47:09,970 --> 01:47:12,990
That's got to be fucking crazy.
But they're nice man.

2643
01:47:12,991 --> 01:47:15,330
People are almost universally nice to 
me.

2644
01:47:15,750 --> 01:47:17,130
It's not hard.
You know,

2645
01:47:17,131 --> 01:47:18,020
people go,
what's up joe?

2646
01:47:18,021 --> 01:47:18,390
I go,
hey,

2647
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:19,830
what's up?
It's not hard.

2648
01:47:19,831 --> 01:47:21,470
It's not like.
But when people are staring at you,

2649
01:47:21,490 --> 01:47:24,180
like at restaurants,
I'm a nice guy,

2650
01:47:24,181 --> 01:47:24,990
man.
You know,

2651
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:26,850
they say hi,
I'll say hi.

2652
01:47:26,851 --> 01:47:27,420
You know,
it's uh,

2653
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:32,470
it's not that to me,
it's just a bunch of people that are 

2654
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:32,470
being nice to you.
If I was known for being like,

2655
01:47:32,470 --> 01:47:35,040
here's a perfect example,
if you were like George Zimmerman,

2656
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:37,920
you know,
like that's kind of the trick.

2657
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:40,380
Shooting trayvon martin.
If you were that kind of famous,

2658
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:41,070
that would have to be.

2659
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:46,100
That would be very disconcerting because
you're famous for something horrible or 

2660
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:49,611
that egg incognito guy.
He just got arrested again last night 

2661
01:47:49,611 --> 01:47:51,420
for punching.
Is allegedly allegedly signed cognito?

2662
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:52,380
No,
no,

2663
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:52,810
no,
no,

2664
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:54,640
no.
Zimmerman mean,

2665
01:47:55,220 --> 01:47:57,600
look,
you're gonna you're gonna run into crazy

2666
01:47:57,601 --> 01:47:59,310
people.
No matter what you do in this life,

2667
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:01,560
whether you're famous,
whether you're not famous and you know,

2668
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:06,060
if you're a friendly person being famous
as long as you manage it correctly,

2669
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:07,500
as long as you don't think it's,
you know,

2670
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:10,180
you don't believe it.
Can't believe it can't,

2671
01:48:10,190 --> 01:48:14,490
but you have to enjoy like you come,
you come from basically worked hard.

2672
01:48:14,491 --> 01:48:15,390
You deserve it.
And I like,

2673
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,010
it never seems to get old.
People were like,

2674
01:48:17,011 --> 01:48:17,910
man,
do you ever get nervous?

2675
01:48:17,911 --> 01:48:18,510
I'm like,
no man,

2676
01:48:18,511 --> 01:48:19,830
that's so cool.
You know,

2677
01:48:19,831 --> 01:48:21,360
maybe you inspire a lot of people.
I mean,

2678
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:23,380
you're everywhere so people maybe feel 
inspired and is like,

2679
01:48:23,430 --> 01:48:24,180
man,
thanks joe.

2680
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:25,410
Keep.
Keep on going.

2681
01:48:25,411 --> 01:48:26,280
That's cool.
I mean you get.

2682
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:27,240
Well,
if that's the case,

2683
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:28,560
I'm happy to do it.
You know,

2684
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:31,740
I think I've been inspired by a shitload
of people in my life,

2685
01:48:31,741 --> 01:48:36,741
so if there's ever anybody that I can 
inspire to me that's a huge gift to be 

2686
01:48:36,741 --> 01:48:37,710
able to turn that back around.
You know,

2687
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:38,700
for sure.
I think we all,

2688
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:40,830
everybody in this room's doing that in 
some way,

2689
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:43,620
shape or form and I think doing a 
podcast is doing that,

2690
01:48:43,950 --> 01:48:45,900
you know,
having a podcast is like,

2691
01:48:46,430 --> 01:48:49,050
you know,
literally inspiration in a digital form.

2692
01:48:49,110 --> 01:48:54,110
A lot of them conversations with people 
that you might not ever get to sit down 

2693
01:48:54,110 --> 01:48:55,020
with and you're,
you're talking like I had graham hancock

2694
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:56,640
on last week and you know,
I mean,

2695
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,250
can you start smoking weed again?
Not yet,

2696
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,700
not yet.

2697
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:05,640
He freaked out because the biggest donor
ever he was,

2698
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:08,450
he was off the rails.
He was looking,

2699
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:10,500
he was smoking every day,
all day.

2700
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:13,740
That's way too much.
I never vaporizing too.

2701
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:16,530
So when you're hitting that vaporizing 
bag,

2702
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:18,290
god damn,
you're getting a lot of thc.

2703
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:24,170
No big deal.
Don't take a daY off here and there and 

2704
01:49:24,170 --> 01:49:24,600
you know,
what else is good about?

2705
01:49:24,601 --> 01:49:27,000
We do it with someone that you like,
you know,

2706
01:49:27,480 --> 01:49:30,150
like eddie bravo and I will get together
with smoke a little weed.

2707
01:49:30,260 --> 01:49:31,890
There were never,
you know,

2708
01:49:32,150 --> 01:49:33,420
it's a cool,
calm,

2709
01:49:33,421 --> 01:49:36,180
collected situation.
It's gonna enhance the conversation.

2710
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:40,170
We're going to have a nice time by 
themselves.

2711
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:45,760
Big bags of shit.
Some people just trying to get on that 

2712
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:46,950
spiritual level and it could be a 
spiritual way of just chilling.

2713
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:48,090
Relaxing.
Yeah,

2714
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:49,390
it is.
It's a part of the earth.

2715
01:49:49,420 --> 01:49:50,680
It's a part of the earth.
It's.

2716
01:49:50,770 --> 01:49:53,800
We have a relationship with.
If you're waking up hitting the ball,

2717
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:55,420
that's too much.
Well you know what?

2718
01:49:55,421 --> 01:49:57,010
Maybe you need it,
you know,

2719
01:49:57,011 --> 01:49:58,810
I'm not saying what you need or what you
don't need,

2720
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:01,150
but if you don't need it and you're 
fucking out of control,

2721
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:04,360
then you got to deal with your shit.
And that's the out of control thing.

2722
01:50:04,361 --> 01:50:07,300
It's like a psychological balance.
And as a fighter,

2723
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:11,200
I think you probably have the most 
difficult job in all of athletics,

2724
01:50:11,201 --> 01:50:12,370
entertainment,
sports.

2725
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,040
You have the most difficult,
solitary,

2726
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:16,870
lonely,
dangerous,

2727
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:17,520
crazy job

2728
01:50:17,660 --> 01:50:22,660
I think.
I think athletes just in general have 

2729
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:24,831
that because look at the exposure that 
we're getting on twitter and stuff like 

2730
01:50:24,831 --> 01:50:24,831
that.
That stuff wasn't happening with Michael

2731
01:50:24,831 --> 01:50:29,631
Jordan was for.
This goes back to what you're talking 

2732
01:50:29,631 --> 01:50:30,030
about when people were a lot more 
exClusive than because they couldn't get

2733
01:50:30,031 --> 01:50:32,280
into your day to day life as if like,
you know,

2734
01:50:32,281 --> 01:50:33,780
I'm a fan of joe rogan.
So I'm like man,

2735
01:50:33,781 --> 01:50:38,781
what's,
what's joe doing when he's in like 

2736
01:50:38,781 --> 01:50:38,781
Brazil or london or something like that.
So then keep up on you a little bit more

2737
01:50:38,781 --> 01:50:39,850
exclusively.
So then when they see you,

2738
01:50:39,851 --> 01:50:40,440
they're like,
oh hey,

2739
01:50:40,770 --> 01:50:43,500
well that's also a different thing in,
in what we're talking about,

2740
01:50:43,501 --> 01:50:48,501
about like people coming up to you.
Like people coming up to me are 

2741
01:50:48,501 --> 01:50:48,501
universally friendly.
Like um,

2742
01:50:48,501 --> 01:50:49,530
I've avid,
very few people come up to me.

2743
01:50:49,531 --> 01:50:50,220
They weren't friEndly.

2744
01:50:50,510 --> 01:50:55,510
Even if someone didn't disagree with me 
About something that come up and just 

2745
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:58,401
start talking to me and we can have a 
nice conversation about it and there's 

2746
01:50:58,401 --> 01:51:01,130
never hostility,
but online when you're dealing with 

2747
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:04,200
anonymous people,
horrible shit,

2748
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:06,240
internet tough guys because that's.
It's not even.

2749
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:11,270
They're not even,
it's not even a real thing they're 

2750
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,270
saying because they don't really mean 
it.

2751
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,670
They would never say it if you were in 
front of them,

2752
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:15,780
fake the words have no.
What if those people spend half the time

2753
01:51:15,781 --> 01:51:20,781
off the internet or off their cell phone
talking so much and they use that same 

2754
01:51:20,781 --> 01:51:22,110
energy that they do on this side,
but they go to the other side,

2755
01:51:22,430 --> 01:51:23,940
you know,
a much more positive.

2756
01:51:23,941 --> 01:51:28,941
How much more inspirational possibly 
like how much more like ambition they 

2757
01:51:28,941 --> 01:51:28,941
would have him,
you know,

2758
01:51:28,941 --> 01:51:33,711
maybe successful in that aspect,
but some people spend that same amount 

2759
01:51:33,711 --> 01:51:34,440
of energy as you would over here on the 
good side.

2760
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:37,080
Spending it on the negative side if 
you're able to just to turn it around.

2761
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:38,640
It's the same effort.
Yeah.

2762
01:51:38,641 --> 01:51:43,350
I learned that very early in life that 
even though there's a real big pole

2763
01:51:43,400 --> 01:51:48,400
to think about other people and dwell on
other people and be angry about other 

2764
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:51,500
people and look about their success or 
compare it to your success,

2765
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:56,740
that shit is all flawed and dangerous 
because it robs you of your time for 

2766
01:51:58,230 --> 01:52:03,230
time you spend,
even though it feels natural to hate on 

2767
01:52:03,230 --> 01:52:06,791
somebody,
that time you spend hating on someone 

2768
01:52:06,791 --> 01:52:09,920
robs you of your own time.
You are literally hating on yourself and

2769
01:52:09,921 --> 01:52:13,010
you don't even realize it because you're
a smart person.

2770
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:18,160
You only have a certain amount of free 
time and your fucking day because if 

2771
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,370
you're a smart person,
you find shit you love to do.

2772
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:21,410
Whether it's a relationship you love to 
do,

2773
01:52:21,411 --> 01:52:25,010
whether it's a sport you love to do,
whether it's a job you like to pursue,

2774
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:30,160
you don't have much time and anytime you
spend on some nonsense and gossip and 

2775
01:52:30,441 --> 01:52:35,441
stupidity,
when you see these gossipy websites and 

2776
01:52:35,441 --> 01:52:36,800
people talking shit about people where 
you're like,

2777
01:52:36,801 --> 01:52:38,990
why would you even write that?
What are they doing?

2778
01:52:38,991 --> 01:52:42,970
They're distracting themselves from 
their own failure reversals.

2779
01:52:43,100 --> 01:52:48,100
It's amazing.
There's some people that ain't even on 

2780
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:48,100
that level,
you know,

2781
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:48,100
lost a lot of friends growing,

2782
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:51,280
growing up and getting to where I'm at,
but it's probably a good decision 

2783
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:51,410
making.
Some people just don't ever get it.

2784
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:56,650
They don't ever know how to flip that 
switch and realize that it's the same 

2785
01:52:56,650 --> 01:52:57,650
amount of energy that you spend doing 
bad as the same amount that you could be

2786
01:52:57,651 --> 01:53:02,651
spending doing good.
It's all goes to the decisions and 

2787
01:53:02,651 --> 01:53:02,870
momentum.
They get on momentum.

2788
01:53:02,871 --> 01:53:05,030
They get caught up in this wave of 
hating,

2789
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:08,140
hating on people or gossiping about 
people.

2790
01:53:08,141 --> 01:53:13,141
We're talking about someone that you 
don't even fucking know how many people 

2791
01:53:13,141 --> 01:53:15,020
you've ever heard like talking about 
like reality stars on tv,

2792
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:17,380
talking like tmz,
people like their job.

2793
01:53:17,510 --> 01:53:19,160
There's three types of people in this 
world,

2794
01:53:19,161 --> 01:53:19,580
man.
There's,

2795
01:53:19,700 --> 01:53:21,950
there's talkers,
there's watchers and there's doers.

2796
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:24,050
You know,
and if it wasn't for like people like,

2797
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,510
like real famous people or whatever,
teams,

2798
01:53:26,570 --> 01:53:29,330
people don't even have a job because 
they don't know who to go follow anymore

2799
01:53:29,331 --> 01:53:29,810
and be like,
oh,

2800
01:53:29,811 --> 01:53:30,650
what are they doing now?

2801
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:33,710
Are like system.
Think of when I made a tmz guy that he's

2802
01:53:33,711 --> 01:53:37,160
just a cool dude and transitionary job.
That's My approach.

2803
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:42,340
I like to think that right now he's 
taking a camera in front of people's 

2804
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:42,340
faces at the airport.
But hey man,

2805
01:53:42,340 --> 01:53:42,950
I'm just trying to make some money.
I don't know,

2806
01:53:42,951 --> 01:53:44,540
dude.
I used to deliver newspapers,

2807
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:46,100
you know,
I don't,

2808
01:53:46,101 --> 01:53:48,620
I try not to judge anybody doing any of 
that shit,

2809
01:53:49,270 --> 01:53:51,200
you know,
but it's a job that exists.

2810
01:53:51,201 --> 01:53:56,201
It's not his fault that that job exists.
The problem is there is a demand demand 

2811
01:53:56,201 --> 01:53:56,690
for their,
for nonsense.

2812
01:53:56,780 --> 01:53:58,790
And mom,
I'm guilty as charged man,

2813
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:03,940
if I see,
cause there was a fake video apparently 

2814
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:03,940
wasn't really kanye west,
but it was a,

2815
01:54:03,940 --> 01:54:05,720
it was saying the kanye west was 
knocking out these,

2816
01:54:05,721 --> 01:54:10,721
um,
these people that were paparazzi and 

2817
01:54:10,721 --> 01:54:11,780
austin and mean whoever this dude was 
that looks like kanye west,

2818
01:54:11,781 --> 01:54:12,170
but it wasn't.

2819
01:54:12,170 --> 01:54:17,170
Kanye west is just uncork and lefthand.
The video has been removed,

2820
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:19,690
just bombs on these dudes.
And it's,

2821
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:23,510
he obviously has skills because he ducks
under a punch and connects with a punch.

2822
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:26,120
He hits hard and he knocks these three 
dudes out and it's video.

2823
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:29,360
I watched it three times.
What the fuck am I watching that for?

2824
01:54:29,361 --> 01:54:32,210
Like wHy do I give a shit if kanye 
west's getting brawls?

2825
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:37,510
Turns out he wasn't even,
but if he was getting in browser 

2826
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:39,971
photographers,
there's a new thing going around the 

2827
01:54:39,971 --> 01:54:41,951
internet called a game called knockout 
supposedly that I think the east coast 

2828
01:54:41,951 --> 01:54:43,160
was doing these like young kids are 
knocking out old people,

2829
01:54:43,161 --> 01:54:45,110
just innocent people.
There's going up like,

2830
01:54:45,111 --> 01:54:46,310
hey,
having a conversation.

2831
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:51,490
Boom just hits them and they're calling 
this game knockout or something like 

2832
01:54:51,490 --> 01:54:54,821
that and let's go find those faggots and
choke them out and break their arm.

2833
01:54:55,750 --> 01:55:00,750
A squadron of guys going out to look for
these motherfuckers and so can you 

2834
01:55:00,750 --> 01:55:02,630
imagine that you're walking down the 
goddamn street.

2835
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:07,930
You could be a lady at fucking man with 
kids at home waiting and these dudes 

2836
01:55:07,930 --> 01:55:09,080
combined punch you.
Do those.

2837
01:55:09,710 --> 01:55:14,710
It should be totally legal to take a 
baseball bat to those fuckers fixing to 

2838
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:14,710
chill out.
They don't.

2839
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:19,590
You know what?
There's a lot of dumb kids out there 

2840
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:21,641
that are not raised right.
They don't get any guidance in their 

2841
01:55:21,641 --> 01:55:22,140
life that live in a terrible 
environment.

2842
01:55:22,190 --> 01:55:23,840
They're terrible.
They're broken.

2843
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:25,370
I mean,
I'm not saying you can't be fixed,

2844
01:55:25,371 --> 01:55:30,371
but god damn.
That is a utter lack of respect for 

2845
01:55:30,371 --> 01:55:31,100
humanity.
If you just strike someone for no reason

2846
01:55:31,101 --> 01:55:31,780
for.
Yeah,

2847
01:55:31,781 --> 01:55:36,781
there's a.
There's a point where you grow up 

2848
01:55:36,781 --> 01:55:36,781
though,
you know,

2849
01:55:36,781 --> 01:55:36,781
because you can't,
you can't blame.

2850
01:55:36,781 --> 01:55:37,820
You can blame it on the parents,
but there comes a point where you get to

2851
01:55:37,821 --> 01:55:39,110
a certain point where you're like,
okay,

2852
01:55:39,111 --> 01:55:41,900
I can make a decision for myself to make
either a good choice,

2853
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:43,740
like I don't have to live like this for 
the rest of my life.

2854
01:55:43,741 --> 01:55:44,100
I can go

2855
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:49,100
on and do this,
but just the fact that you would use 

2856
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:49,220
that as an excuse,
like bad parenting and I'm going out and

2857
01:55:49,221 --> 01:55:54,221
I'm like bashing people.
But granted it does start with the 

2858
01:55:54,221 --> 01:55:54,221
parenting.
You know,

2859
01:55:54,221 --> 01:55:54,221
that's,
that's very important.

2860
01:55:54,221 --> 01:55:55,710
I told the guys that are involved 
because it's always.

2861
01:55:55,850 --> 01:56:00,850
It's one dude.
There's like a group of five or six of 

2862
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:02,420
them in one dude.
Just clocks this man passing by and that

2863
01:56:02,421 --> 01:56:03,840
the people in that group,
man,

2864
01:56:03,841 --> 01:56:06,030
there's got to be one per group,

2865
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:11,320
is,
has half a heart and can call the cops 

2866
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:12,740
and report this fucking bastard before 
he does it again.

2867
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:17,960
Use.
There's gotta be there's gotta fuck you 

2868
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:18,700
talking about his group.
So we need to.

2869
01:56:18,830 --> 01:56:19,380
Right?
Okay.

2870
01:56:19,390 --> 01:56:20,100
Yeah,
yeah.

2871
01:56:20,240 --> 01:56:21,400
Come on.
That's ridiculous.

2872
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:26,500
Or rats.
Rats are bad.

2873
01:56:30,201 --> 01:56:34,340
That's a good rat.
Yeah know it's incredibly cowardly move.

2874
01:56:34,341 --> 01:56:37,580
But it's also like they're looking for 
some excitement in their life probably.

2875
01:56:37,820 --> 01:56:42,820
And it's exciting to do something 
horrible like that for all the wrong 

2876
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:42,820
reasons,
but still exciting.

2877
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:44,500
How about getting paid $100,000
to get into a gym,

2878
01:56:44,501 --> 01:56:45,730
you know,
dana white stone out,

2879
01:56:45,731 --> 01:56:46,760
big bonuses,
you know,

2880
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:47,200
get some.

2881
01:56:47,670 --> 01:56:51,790
So that's the real knock say to people 
when people talk to me about fighting,

2882
01:56:51,791 --> 01:56:52,530
you know,
they're like,

2883
01:56:52,780 --> 01:56:55,330
why don't you go find them and mega,
what are you talking about?

2884
01:56:55,331 --> 01:56:57,640
Like,
do you understand what fighting is like,

2885
01:56:57,641 --> 01:56:59,230
yo man,
you kicked somebodies ass.

2886
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:04,350
I always say this like,
you think fighting is kicking someone's 

2887
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,590
ass.
Know that happens sometimes,

2888
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:08,770
but it's fighting and everybody wants to
kick someone's ass,

2889
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:11,800
but nobody wants to fight.
Nobody wants to have a jon jones.

2890
01:57:11,801 --> 01:57:15,160
Alexander gustafson where you sanchez 
gilbert were,

2891
01:57:15,161 --> 01:57:16,210
you have,
you know,

2892
01:57:16,211 --> 01:57:19,900
you're letting it all hang out in there 
and if that is

2893
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,290
not your sole idea of what to be doing 
with your life,

2894
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:26,570
you shouldn't be fucking doing it.
Exactly.

2895
01:57:26,600 --> 01:57:28,520
Because there's a dude like that out 
there.

2896
01:57:28,521 --> 01:57:30,230
There's the alexander gustafson out 
there,

2897
01:57:30,231 --> 01:57:32,840
there's the John Jones out there,
there's a Jeremy Stevens out there.

2898
01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:35,840
There's dudes out there that that's what
they do.

2899
01:57:35,870 --> 01:57:37,340
Those guys are fighting for real man.
You're,

2900
01:57:37,341 --> 01:57:40,160
you're born with like natural talent.
Like with those guys,

2901
01:57:40,161 --> 01:57:45,161
you know,
they just made the decision to take it 

2902
01:57:45,161 --> 01:57:45,161
to a whole nother level.
You know,

2903
01:57:45,161 --> 01:57:49,030
and you're right man.
You find out a lot about a guy when you 

2904
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:49,030
hit them,
isn't going to just fold over.

2905
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:53,771
Let me just beat him up to the rough,
pulls them off or is he going to take a 

2906
01:57:53,771 --> 01:57:53,771
hit?
Keep coming back fighting strong,

2907
01:57:53,771 --> 01:57:53,990
you know?
and that's,

2908
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:56,780
that's where that class comes in.
Like we're at the end,

2909
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:02,020
at the end of the fight,
as soon as that buzzer hits and they 

2910
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:02,020
know it's all over,
all the training,

2911
01:58:02,020 --> 01:58:05,861
everything.
And they just give each other a hug and 

2912
01:58:05,861 --> 01:58:05,861
people are just like,
man,

2913
01:58:05,861 --> 01:58:06,050
that's amazing what those two fighters 
have.

2914
01:58:06,051 --> 01:58:08,030
Like,
they know each other better than anybody

2915
01:58:08,031 --> 01:58:09,410
at that particular moment.
They're just,

2916
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:10,550
they're just on one.
You know,

2917
01:58:10,551 --> 01:58:12,140
they have so much respect for one 
another,

2918
01:58:12,141 --> 01:58:17,141
you know,
they're able to go to war and plus it's 

2919
01:58:17,141 --> 01:58:17,141
entertaining for the fans and they just 
see something that's,

2920
01:58:17,141 --> 01:58:17,750
that's almost priceless,
you know?

2921
01:58:17,830 --> 01:58:18,570
Yeah.
No,

2922
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:21,710
it's most exciting sport of all time.
you know,

2923
01:58:21,711 --> 01:58:25,240
there's no sport that gets closer to the
raw nature of,

2924
01:58:25,241 --> 01:58:30,241
uh,
of a fight to the death of fight or 

2925
01:58:30,241 --> 01:58:30,500
flight,
of being able to test your will,

2926
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:31,850
your heart,
your courage.

2927
01:58:31,851 --> 01:58:34,100
You're willing to put it all on the line
against another persons.

2928
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:39,250
And not just in that moment,
but in all that time that you spend 

2929
01:58:39,250 --> 01:58:42,010
preparing for that moment,
the guy who was more willing,

2930
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:47,160
that guy who was more enthused,
the guy was more disciplined and 

2931
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:48,490
smarter.
All those things have to come together.

2932
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:52,570
And now also you're dealing also like 
what we were talking about,

2933
01:58:52,630 --> 01:58:55,150
these super athletes,
these guys like hector lumbar,

2934
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:57,910
these guys like tyron woodley,
thEse,

2935
01:58:57,911 --> 01:59:00,310
these guys that are coming along like 
jesus christ,

2936
01:59:00,620 --> 01:59:03,510
sergio pettis to little 20 year old kid.
You know,

2937
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:08,530
you can name all those guys,
but then you gotta you gotta think here 

2938
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:10,961
before too long there's going to be some
little kid right now thAt he's going to 

2939
01:59:10,961 --> 01:59:11,180
turn 18.
And he'd be like,

2940
01:59:11,181 --> 01:59:12,380
no,
this is what I've been training for.

2941
01:59:12,381 --> 01:59:15,110
This is what I do.
And by the time he's 19 years old,

2942
01:59:15,170 --> 01:59:19,470
could be fighting in the ufc and be one 
like tyson bad dude like tyson.

2943
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:20,780
Exactly.

2944
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:25,390
You remember those days we used to watch
tyson on espn and see the highlight

2945
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:30,420
some zoos.
Why in a body shop to a write up or you 

2946
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:32,870
just admitted that he was on coke during
those fights?

2947
01:59:32,900 --> 01:59:33,320
No,
no.

2948
01:59:33,321 --> 01:59:35,150
The later fights after prison.
Yeah.

2949
01:59:35,151 --> 01:59:40,151
Yeah.
After three is he had like 300 million 

2950
01:59:40,151 --> 01:59:41,240
people were taking advantage of them,
but just beginner days poses.

2951
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,600
It was after,
so it wasn't during the ferocious days.

2952
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:49,760
I think he was saying that it was at,
let's find out tyson had immense hooked 

2953
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:49,760
on cocaine

2954
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:51,940
because it would make sense because if 
you look at his early fights when he was

2955
01:59:51,941 --> 01:59:53,920
just destroying people.
That makes sense.

2956
01:59:53,921 --> 01:59:56,470
He looks like he's on coke.
I think he was just so,

2957
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,680
so crazy,
but he had so much power in such a gift,

2958
02:00:00,010 --> 02:00:01,960
but he.
He would like cry before his fights.

2959
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:02,420
Dude,
like that's.

2960
02:00:02,510 --> 02:00:07,510
That's a scary part when you're about to
go on stage and you're in the back and 

2961
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:07,510
you're just waiting.
That's the crazy part.

2962
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:12,481
Like normally a fight.
You know what's funny is you're talking 

2963
02:00:12,481 --> 02:00:15,421
about that one documentary where he's 
crying before the junior olympics where 

2964
02:00:15,421 --> 02:00:15,421
it goes out and knocks.
It did not.

2965
02:00:15,421 --> 02:00:20,360
I found out through frAnkie lyles 
because they're good friends and he did 

2966
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:21,520
My podcast when I get allows,
former wba champion.

2967
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:26,730
He said that he was on this whole time,
I thought Mike Tyson is Crying outside 

2968
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:26,970
of his.

2969
02:00:27,090 --> 02:00:28,880
His coach has to come out and get them 
teddy,

2970
02:00:28,960 --> 02:00:31,510
teddy atlas and it appears that he's 
talking them through it,

2971
02:00:31,511 --> 02:00:34,030
like saying you can do this,
you train hard for that,

2972
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:36,640
and then they come back and that's what 
it looks like,

2973
02:00:36,790 --> 02:00:38,920
but according to frankie lyles is really
good friend.

2974
02:00:39,130 --> 02:00:44,130
He said that no,
he was crying because he knew he was 

2975
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:44,650
going to kill the guy and it was going 
to be so much fun.

2976
02:00:44,651 --> 02:00:46,360
He couldn't believe he's finally going 
to be.

2977
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:48,730
He's gonna win this junior olympic 
thing.

2978
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:51,500
That's why he was crying and teddy out.
This was going,

2979
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:52,460
come on.
It's just like,

2980
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,220
let's go get it,
go do it,

2981
02:00:54,221 --> 02:00:57,880
and then we can celebrate later from

2982
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:02,940
2007 from the rent in 19 in 2000.
Our loose alvarez,

2983
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:08,400
he was high and he was on coke and 
that's when he started using a rubber 

2984
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:09,370
dick.
He started using a wizard later.

2985
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:14,430
What year was this?
This was 2000 post prison and he did 

2986
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:19,270
test positive for marijuana after a 
fight in 2000 with andrea gelada.

2987
02:01:19,540 --> 02:01:21,490
He got,
they find them 200,000

2988
02:01:21,491 --> 02:01:26,491
bucks.
He said he didn't have a chance to get 

2989
02:01:26,491 --> 02:01:29,281
the wizard from,
from a member of his team was hold this 

2990
02:01:29,281 --> 02:01:29,920
rubber dick.
That's crazy.

2991
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:32,410
He said he lost his mind,
but back then he said,

2992
02:01:32,411 --> 02:01:34,900
uh,
he said that he was,

2993
02:01:34,901 --> 02:01:39,901
um,
he bit lennox lewis when he was high on 

2994
02:01:39,901 --> 02:01:39,901
cocaine in two,
two.

2995
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,220
All that shit.
Well,

2996
02:01:41,260 --> 02:01:43,480
I'll fuck you in front of you.
I'll fuck you to you.

2997
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:44,220
Love me.
Faggot.

2998
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:49,710
That was a great.
Maybe the greatest thing anyone's ever 

2999
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:53,620
come on.
Fuck you to you.

3000
02:01:54,490 --> 02:01:57,920
Do you realize man enough to fuck with 
me?

3001
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:02,980
Do you realize how long that will take?
Years old.

3002
02:02:04,810 --> 02:02:09,810
He was insane.
Do that ferocious attitude and he would 

3003
02:02:09,810 --> 02:02:10,850
just land blow after heavy blow and he'd
be like,

3004
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:13,220
I just keep punching because he knows 
he's just breaking you.

3005
02:02:13,221 --> 02:02:14,440
And those guys would just.
Well,

3006
02:02:14,450 --> 02:02:16,940
he was high when he was fighting and he 
wasn't training.

3007
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:22,710
Yeah,
he even mentioned he got knocked down 

3008
02:02:22,710 --> 02:02:23,000
before the buster douglas fight and in 
buster douglas.

3009
02:02:23,001 --> 02:02:24,500
Actually,
that's a crazy story about him.

3010
02:02:24,501 --> 02:02:28,910
His mom died like three weeks before 
that fight and he still took that fight.

3011
02:02:28,911 --> 02:02:33,911
So you know,
that dude's just like unlike another 

3012
02:02:33,911 --> 02:02:34,160
mental level because that already he 
would just been really screwed up,

3013
02:02:34,161 --> 02:02:36,650
but he obviously seemed like he was on a
whole nother level.

3014
02:02:36,710 --> 02:02:38,180
Listen to this,
he wrote his memoir.

3015
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:40,670
The history of war is the history of 
drugs.

3016
02:02:40,910 --> 02:02:44,510
Every great general and warrior from the
beginning of time was high.

3017
02:02:45,610 --> 02:02:49,550
Who put the rug that that's what he 
wrote his memoirs.

3018
02:02:49,860 --> 02:02:51,980
And you know what?
There's a lot to it.

3019
02:02:51,981 --> 02:02:56,981
When you find out the bushes brought in 
more cooked in the state and the states 

3020
02:02:56,981 --> 02:03:00,191
than any other drug cartels combined.
Could you imagine if we find out that 

3021
02:03:00,191 --> 02:03:02,000
the military industrial complex,
just a bunch of coke heads.

3022
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:04,020
Oh dude,
dude,

3023
02:03:04,021 --> 02:03:05,420
it was,
it was chosen.

3024
02:03:05,421 --> 02:03:06,270
TheY call them the,
uh,

3025
02:03:06,271 --> 02:03:09,500
the angel of the or the lord of the 
skies.

3026
02:03:09,501 --> 02:03:11,100
There was this old cocaine dealer 
before.

3027
02:03:11,101 --> 02:03:16,101
They'll chapo guzman.
They called this guy the lord of the 

3028
02:03:16,101 --> 02:03:17,030
skies and my spanish isn't that good to 
even remember what it was,

3029
02:03:17,031 --> 02:03:22,031
but this guy was one of the,
he was the richest and probably no one 

3030
02:03:22,031 --> 02:03:22,460
else will ever top the guy,
the lord of the skies.

3031
02:03:22,460 --> 02:03:23,120
What he,
uh,

3032
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:27,530
he basically bought out all the police,
all the government and was paying top,

3033
02:03:27,531 --> 02:03:28,520
top dollar.
I mean,

3034
02:03:28,521 --> 02:03:30,890
he was born,
he was in Mexico,

3035
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:33,290
he was in Mexico and he's flying and 
drugs to theu ,

3036
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:37,310
s and was using all of these resources.
So there's no doubt in my mind,

3037
02:03:37,670 --> 02:03:38,290
you know,
I,

3038
02:03:38,350 --> 02:03:39,800
you know,
I'm not disrespecting anybody,

3039
02:03:39,801 --> 02:03:41,960
but there's no doubt in my mind that,
that stuff is,

3040
02:03:42,040 --> 02:03:43,630
is very for sure.
And people,

3041
02:03:43,640 --> 02:03:48,640
cops,
governmental officials are getting paid 

3042
02:03:48,640 --> 02:03:50,981
off.
Have you ever seen the clinton 

3043
02:03:50,981 --> 02:03:50,981
chronicles?
It's on youtube.

3044
02:03:50,981 --> 02:03:51,200
It's a documentary now.
What is it?

3045
02:03:53,750 --> 02:03:56,690
Watch the clinton chronicles.
It's on youtube.

3046
02:03:56,691 --> 02:03:57,920
It's free.
It's,

3047
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:00,140
it's a history of bill clinton,
man.

3048
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:04,560
And when you find out why he became 
president and what he did in Arkansas,

3049
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:09,640
governor,
that dude was more 10 times more 

3050
02:04:09,640 --> 02:04:10,880
gangster than any 100 times more than 
john gotti.

3051
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:13,070
What about the bush and the family and 
stuff like that?

3052
02:04:13,071 --> 02:04:13,640
They,
they,

3053
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:17,060
I remember bill clinton was working for 
George Bush.

3054
02:04:17,070 --> 02:04:18,920
Dad,
they're all tied in this,

3055
02:04:18,921 --> 02:04:23,921
uh,
this family bloodline of bush goes back 

3056
02:04:23,921 --> 02:04:24,140
to the guy they called dracula in this 
dracula guy.

3057
02:04:24,141 --> 02:04:29,141
Would he,
would those people that would fight him 

3058
02:04:29,141 --> 02:04:31,370
or that he's tied into a bloodline of 
just deep war roots in that it goes all 

3059
02:04:32,991 --> 02:04:36,380
the waY back to that.
But none of them are like rob ford,

3060
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:39,300
rob ford still on top.
The toronto mayor guy.

3061
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:47,010
According to the clinton chronicles man,
all the stuff that the media was,

3062
02:04:47,070 --> 02:04:49,470
there was a media blackout at all the 
shit that he,

3063
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:52,110
that he went through an Arkansas.
Jeez,

3064
02:04:52,140 --> 02:04:54,050
you've heard you've heard,
uh,

3065
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:59,180
other shady shit around them.
I've always heard that that was a lot 

3066
02:04:59,180 --> 02:05:01,510
about seals and the mena Arkansas.
But when you look into exactly what he 

3067
02:05:03,121 --> 02:05:06,660
did and how it went down,
it's like a two hour documentary.

3068
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:09,180
It's insane.
Bill clinton is,

3069
02:05:09,930 --> 02:05:12,270
according to this documentary,
the clinton chronicles,

3070
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:16,520
he's a super cool kid.
Him and his brother rogers,

3071
02:05:16,521 --> 02:05:18,060
super coke heads.
they were.

3072
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:23,510
They were the ones that were allowing 
the coke to be dropped off from latin 

3073
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:23,510
America,
from columbia.

3074
02:05:23,510 --> 02:05:25,260
They drop it off.
Arkansas was the hub.

3075
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:26,940
Mena Arkansas.
look that up.

3076
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:27,960
Google,
mena,

3077
02:05:27,961 --> 02:05:29,460
Arkansas.
That's where it all came through.

3078
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:33,180
Bill clinton let all of the coke come 
through during the Iran contra thing.

3079
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,970
They got busted doing this.
Ronald reagan.

3080
02:05:35,971 --> 02:05:38,070
And is there any evidence that he was a 
coke head,

3081
02:05:38,071 --> 02:05:40,380
like saying that he's a coke head like 
that dude.

3082
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:42,290
According to this documentary,
according,

3083
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:44,520
according to the documentary,
who was the documentary?

3084
02:05:44,521 --> 02:05:45,300
Biogen.
What's it called?

3085
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:48,270
It's called the clinton chronicles.
Trust me on this one.

3086
02:05:48,271 --> 02:05:51,030
This will blow you the fuck away,
dude.

3087
02:05:51,120 --> 02:05:52,530
He had everybody on lock.
Dude.

3088
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:54,380
Everybody.
All public officials.

3089
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:57,080
You know what I love doing?
Those people that are the reason they're

3090
02:05:57,090 --> 02:06:02,090
in powerful positions because of their 
decision making and some of the stuff 

3091
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:02,750
that I imagine that they have to do.
I mean you,

3092
02:06:02,751 --> 02:06:05,510
you read about like royalty and this 
crazy stuff that they'll,

3093
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:08,760
they'll do to kids for power and and all
this crazy stuff.

3094
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,610
Man.
I like the bohemian grove type shit.

3095
02:06:11,611 --> 02:06:13,310
Yeah.
But there's even stuff like over in like

3096
02:06:13,450 --> 02:06:16,620
this in europe,
there's like this castle where they talk

3097
02:06:16,621 --> 02:06:21,621
about these like little kids that,
that they basically like do these crazy 

3098
02:06:21,621 --> 02:06:22,780
axon,
almost like molestation for like their,

3099
02:06:22,781 --> 02:06:25,020
their power and like they're,
they're crazy.

3100
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:30,020
Like an adrenaline.
Like when they skull and bones type 

3101
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:30,020
shit,
it just gets way.

3102
02:06:30,020 --> 02:06:31,240
De freemason type shit gets bizarre,
you know?

3103
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:33,420
Do you ever do,
do google,

3104
02:06:33,421 --> 02:06:35,790
like when you see soMething like the 
current and cargoes,

3105
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:38,310
do you ever google the clinton 
chronicles debunked?

3106
02:06:38,700 --> 02:06:42,360
I don't believe those doors.
You look at the wikipedia that there are

3107
02:06:42,370 --> 02:06:45,660
so many people paid to put up those 
debunk websites.

3108
02:06:45,900 --> 02:06:49,440
I can't believe any of that shit.
I need to see the alternative media.

3109
02:06:49,441 --> 02:06:53,070
That stuff.
That's all the official story of this is

3110
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:54,990
what the mainstream wants you to 
believe.

3111
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:58,530
I already doubt anything maInstream 
sometimes.

3112
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,690
Sometimes.
Sometimes it's facts though,

3113
02:07:00,750 --> 02:07:02,880
man.
You got to look at both sides.

3114
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:03,530
There's a.
There's.

3115
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:06,360
There's a lot of fact and the clinton 
chronicles man,

3116
02:07:06,361 --> 02:07:11,361
there's some serious times caught it 
discredited due to its weak 

3117
02:07:11,361 --> 02:07:13,250
circumstantial evidence in coincidence.
Exactly.

3118
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:16,200
That's of course they gotta.
We gotta host.

3119
02:07:16,210 --> 02:07:18,070
Awesome black helicopters.
Yeah.

3120
02:07:18,140 --> 02:07:19,170
Yeah.
Watch it.

3121
02:07:19,270 --> 02:07:21,860
Trust black helicopters if you believe.
man,

3122
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:25,950
where does the documents?
It's insane,

3123
02:07:25,951 --> 02:07:26,680
man.
I mean,

3124
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:29,550
have a document that's official stuff 
like Washington post.

3125
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:31,650
They're bought and sold.
Come on cnn.

3126
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:33,700
They're and sold.
You can.

3127
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:35,680
I'll show you the bitch.

3128
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:38,410
Yeah,
some of them for sure.

3129
02:07:38,411 --> 02:07:40,060
There's definitely a lot of fuckery 
going on.

3130
02:07:40,730 --> 02:07:42,100
Some of those things.
You know,

3131
02:07:42,610 --> 02:07:47,610
the problem with documentaries is almost
anybody can make a documentary about 

3132
02:07:47,610 --> 02:07:48,850
mena Arkansas.
That shit went down.

3133
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:52,510
I ran contra back down.
You're right about that,

3134
02:07:52,720 --> 02:07:54,880
but who knows whether or not he's 
actually a cokehead.

3135
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:58,580
I wonder if the dude's doing blow and 
getting crazy and witness.

3136
02:07:58,630 --> 02:07:59,510
You know what I'm saying?
You know,

3137
02:07:59,530 --> 02:08:04,530
what I'm fascinated with right now is 
there's so many ex cia agents come and 

3138
02:08:04,530 --> 02:08:07,630
clean and talking man,
and there's a bunch of them.

3139
02:08:08,080 --> 02:08:09,550
Yeah.
Do you ever watch homeland?

3140
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:10,570
No.

3141
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:15,680
People are going to start dying and 
great trades in car crashes and there's 

3142
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:15,690
a lot of deaths.
Man there happened in nine slash 11.

3143
02:08:15,710 --> 02:08:17,650
You,
you hear about like loose change and all

3144
02:08:17,670 --> 02:08:19,670
the other documentaries that we're 
talking about.

3145
02:08:19,690 --> 02:08:20,440
Then they're like,
all of a sudden,

3146
02:08:20,441 --> 02:08:22,200
like,
this guy died in a fire at his house.

3147
02:08:23,230 --> 02:08:26,580
Chronicles is hard because anybody that 
comes forward as a witness,

3148
02:08:26,850 --> 02:08:30,030
they all get their heads blown off and 
then the corner put suicide.

3149
02:08:30,031 --> 02:08:32,130
She,
the sofa body after body after body.

3150
02:08:32,131 --> 02:08:33,750
People die.
Tila tequila.

3151
02:08:33,840 --> 02:08:36,810
Who's dating the johnson and johnson.
What happened is the girl,

3152
02:08:36,811 --> 02:08:39,180
the tila tequila,
uh,

3153
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:40,360
she was dating,
you know,

3154
02:08:40,410 --> 02:08:42,180
like baby johnson,
the shampoo and stuff,

3155
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:47,110
or she was doing her like her lesbian 
thing with the daughter and the daughter

3156
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:48,140
had ended up dying.
Well,

3157
02:08:48,141 --> 02:08:50,250
like tila,
tequila come out in this crazy,

3158
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:55,290
uh,
youtube videos was talking about 

3159
02:08:55,290 --> 02:08:55,290
illuminati.

3160
02:08:55,290 --> 02:08:58,100
It was in this.
People are trying to give me the 

3161
02:08:58,100 --> 02:08:58,100
shutters on her.
No,

3162
02:08:58,100 --> 02:08:58,100
I don't.
I don't.

3163
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:00,330
I'm not for sure exactly what's out.
Anybody do anything but laugh.

3164
02:09:00,590 --> 02:09:03,270
They found out that if I was the 
illuminati,

3165
02:09:03,271 --> 02:09:05,610
I would want to look tequila.
Talk about the illuminati.

3166
02:09:06,120 --> 02:09:07,060
I'd be like,
hey,

3167
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:09,600
I send her a fucking dossier with 
everything in it.

3168
02:09:10,170 --> 02:09:12,790
Everything we're doing at tell that 
bitch to start our website.

3169
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:17,800
He was doing a good job there.
She started doing that and then they 

3170
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:17,800
would go,
yeah,

3171
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:17,800
yeah.
Tila tequila told you that.

3172
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:19,590
Okay,
we're done here.

3173
02:09:20,110 --> 02:09:23,880
You just release all the truths and just
give it to tila tequila.

3174
02:09:24,060 --> 02:09:25,800
That's the way when she starts her show,
you'd be like,

3175
02:09:25,810 --> 02:09:28,590
what?
What tila tequila is edward snowden?

3176
02:09:28,830 --> 02:09:30,660
Tila tequila is julian and his size.
No,

3177
02:09:30,661 --> 02:09:31,860
it's fucking tila.
Tequila.

3178
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:34,160
Stopped bitch.
you think?

3179
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,000
Look there.
That's ridiculous.

3180
02:09:36,001 --> 02:09:37,410
That.
That's just crazy though.

3181
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:38,990
Using her.
She's.

3182
02:09:39,080 --> 02:09:43,870
She's a pawn.
The documents,

3183
02:09:45,210 --> 02:09:47,180
they can find a better spokesperson for 
tila.

3184
02:09:47,240 --> 02:09:51,620
Fucking tequila.
She went off tila.

3185
02:09:51,621 --> 02:09:55,970
Tequila are lovers let's.
Killers died seven times.

3186
02:09:56,330 --> 02:09:58,490
Sure.
She has to shut that off.

3187
02:09:58,491 --> 02:09:59,550
Stop.
Is that what it says?

3188
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:02,870
Exactly.
Talking about,

3189
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:09,020
you tried talking to neil tyson or you 
know sam harris,

3190
02:10:09,711 --> 02:10:14,711
about what tIla tequila told you.
They'll fucking eyes to glaze over the 

3191
02:10:14,711 --> 02:10:18,560
conversation he'd done in 10 minutes 
stop and nothing wrong with tequila.

3192
02:10:18,640 --> 02:10:20,720
She's a very pretty girl.
Maybe she's got some good points.

3193
02:10:20,990 --> 02:10:23,950
My point is you could get they they.
Oh,

3194
02:10:24,060 --> 02:10:26,270
that's the thing about homeland 
homelands and interesting show.

3195
02:10:26,271 --> 02:10:27,860
It's on showtime.
It's about cia.

3196
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:29,590
I really enjoy it.
The fascinating.

3197
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:30,770
Yeah,
yeah,

3198
02:10:30,771 --> 02:10:35,771
yeah.
It's about the cia and fighting 

3199
02:10:35,771 --> 02:10:35,771
terrorism and people turning terrorists

3200
02:10:35,771 --> 02:10:37,550
and soldiers turning on the government 
look good.

3201
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:38,540
No,
no.

3202
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:40,400
It's a good show.
It's a really good show.

3203
02:10:40,401 --> 02:10:45,401
It's.
It shows how difficult the intelligence 

3204
02:10:45,401 --> 02:10:46,190
businesses though,
and it shows how much they set things up

3205
02:10:46,250 --> 02:10:49,340
and they create fake stories and they 
released fake stories to the news.

3206
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:52,020
It's god damn fascinating.
Really.

3207
02:10:52,030 --> 02:10:52,930
That far?
Yeah.

3208
02:10:52,940 --> 02:10:53,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

3209
02:10:53,361 --> 02:10:56,420
Because when you watch It and you go,
huh,

3210
02:10:56,660 --> 02:11:00,020
I wonder what they actually do because 
this is purely fiction,

3211
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:03,350
so I wonder how much,
how much is actually going on,

3212
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:05,690
how much is actual narrative,
how much they create,

3213
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:10,130
but for sure they create.
Some of it for sure,

3214
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:15,340
for sure.
If there's some shit going on and they 

3215
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:16,730
want to cover up operation mockingbird,
that's not a conspiracy theory.

3216
02:11:16,760 --> 02:11:19,390
How about operation midnight climax.
That's not a conspiracy.

3217
02:11:19,391 --> 02:11:19,900
No,
that's,

3218
02:11:19,930 --> 02:11:23,480
that's a fucking real thing that they 
did with the fbi.

3219
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:28,750
Put brothels in New York and san 
francisco and they got people fucked up 

3220
02:11:30,111 --> 02:11:35,111
on lsd when they thought they were going
to get a hooker and then they monitored 

3221
02:11:35,111 --> 02:11:35,150
them and checked,
um,

3222
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:36,830
did studies on them.
They,

3223
02:11:36,970 --> 02:11:39,630
they do.
They would go in and get the dick suck.

3224
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:43,520
I'm tired of fucking my wife.
I'm tired of my life.

3225
02:11:43,521 --> 02:11:46,180
I'm tired of everything,
but I scraped up 200 bucks.

3226
02:11:46,200 --> 02:11:51,200
My wife doesn't know about it.
I'm going to sneak off this brothel and 

3227
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:52,420
I'm going to blow a lot.
It's going to be glorious and say,

3228
02:11:52,480 --> 02:11:54,500
would you like second a lot of baby 
before we get started,

3229
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,200
I'll tell you a glass of water that I 
drink,

3230
02:11:57,201 --> 02:11:59,090
a little glass of water and all of a 
sudden,

3231
02:11:59,390 --> 02:12:03,050
doo doo,
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

3232
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:07,520
The fucking guys in the suits come in 
with a clipboard and the big glasses and

3233
02:12:07,521 --> 02:12:10,070
they're freaking the fuck out and asking
you questions,

3234
02:12:10,220 --> 02:12:11,480
and these poor guys,
man,

3235
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:16,510
they they,
they did this for years and indeed 

3236
02:12:16,510 --> 02:12:19,540
these,
these unbeknownst to them studies on 

3237
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:22,811
these dudes and it was after the 
government couldn't do it anymore to 

3238
02:12:22,811 --> 02:12:23,240
soldiers just like mine.

3239
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:24,740
Mine warping them and figuring out their
mind.

3240
02:12:24,860 --> 02:12:29,860
First they were trying to figure out 
what the fuck lsd did and for a long 

3241
02:12:29,860 --> 02:12:32,210
time they thought lsd when Robert 
Hoffman,

3242
02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:34,850
Albert Hoffman rather,
when Albert Hoffman created lsd.

3243
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:40,030
Once the Intelligence community found 
out about this incredibly potent 

3244
02:12:40,030 --> 02:12:43,480
psychedelic drug for the western world,
it was one of the first psychedelics 

3245
02:12:43,480 --> 02:12:45,770
have people aware of.
it wasn't until gordon watson discovered

3246
02:12:45,771 --> 02:12:50,771
the psychedelic mushroom,
that people knew that it existed in the 

3247
02:12:50,771 --> 02:12:51,100
western world.
The information for what have you,

3248
02:12:51,101 --> 02:12:53,390
even though there's thousands and 
thousands of years of use,

3249
02:12:53,391 --> 02:12:56,630
had kind of been lost to the modern 
intellectual.

3250
02:12:56,840 --> 02:13:01,840
Well aCid came along by accident.
Albert hoffman discovered acid and then 

3251
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:07,720
the government initially when they found
out about thought that it was going to 

3252
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:07,720
be a truth serum,
they thought,

3253
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:12,370
well,
we're going to do is we're going to get 

3254
02:13:12,370 --> 02:13:14,230
these enemy guys.
We're going to give them acid and 

3255
02:13:14,230 --> 02:13:14,420
they're just going to tell us everything
turned out didn't work that way.

3256
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:17,210
It was just there were too fucked up.
They couldn't make any sense.

3257
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:20,240
They were talking about butterflies 
stealing their underwear and you know,

3258
02:13:20,241 --> 02:13:21,470
there were,
there were madness,

3259
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:23,330
tripping,
tripping hard,

3260
02:13:23,331 --> 02:13:28,331
and by the way,
they didn't know what the doses were 

3261
02:13:28,331 --> 02:13:30,760
like.
The way I've heard it described acid 

3262
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:30,760
biochemically,
it's a fascinating description,

3263
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:32,040
but terrence mckenna said it best.
He said

3264
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:37,040
acid is so strong and the dose is so 
small that an aunt could destroy the 

3265
02:13:38,161 --> 02:13:42,030
entire empire state building in 30 
minutes.

3266
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:46,620
Like that's literally how powerful acid 
is per size per dose.

3267
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:51,920
That and the analogy would be an aunt 
destroying the empire state building in 

3268
02:13:51,920 --> 02:13:52,850
30 minutes.
So it's,

3269
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:57,880
it's so intensely powerful.
And they were given these people large 

3270
02:13:57,880 --> 02:13:58,440
doses so they weren't getting any truth 
out of them.

3271
02:13:58,570 --> 02:14:01,380
So then they thought about and said,
well maybe this is the opposite,

3272
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:03,360
this is what we'll do.
We'll give it to our soldiers.

3273
02:14:03,450 --> 02:14:05,400
And tHen when they get captured we say,
hey,

3274
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:07,770
pop this shit in your mouth to tell 
anybody shit.

3275
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,400
Yeah.
They would give them like a fucking,

3276
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:11,790
like one of those juice boxes filled 
with acid.

3277
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:16,290
They would suck it down when they were 
in the trenches and then no one would be

3278
02:14:16,291 --> 02:14:18,120
able to talk at all.

3279
02:14:18,200 --> 02:14:19,080
Yeah,
for sure.

3280
02:14:19,170 --> 02:14:21,330
Just mine warped.
Then mind warp to.

3281
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:26,480
Well they did a lot of tests for sure on
people where they didn't know about 

3282
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:26,480
acid.
They did those.

3283
02:14:26,480 --> 02:14:29,220
They did a lot of tests on soldiers,
both United States and the arm.

3284
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:34,280
The britiSh armed forces did that and 
they also have the United States did 

3285
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:37,640
tests on unbeknown towns.
They did these clandestine operations 

3286
02:14:37,741 --> 02:14:42,741
where they just,
they took this town in France and they 

3287
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:42,741
put acid in their bread,
you know,

3288
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:44,970
and like people died.
Like people freaked out.

3289
02:14:44,971 --> 02:14:46,340
They did crazy shit.
I mean they,

3290
02:14:46,750 --> 02:14:49,260
they got like seriously dosed acid in 
bread.

3291
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:54,350
Yeah.
This ex cia agent talked about what he 

3292
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:54,350
did personally.
One of the,

3293
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:56,190
one of the things that stuck out in his 
head is in Cuba.

3294
02:14:56,550 --> 02:14:57,560
They would find,
uh,

3295
02:14:57,561 --> 02:14:59,850
the truck route to like elementary 
schools,

3296
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:02,160
hijack the truck,
filled the milk,

3297
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:03,600
throw cement.

3298
02:15:03,660 --> 02:15:08,660
This is what he said.
He could be totally crazy in this 

3299
02:15:08,660 --> 02:15:09,150
documentary and saying,
but he's saying he's an ex cia agent and

3300
02:15:09,151 --> 02:15:11,370
this is stuff that they wanted a cost 
chaos.

3301
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:13,950
They would infiltrate Cuba.
They wanted to,

3302
02:15:14,550 --> 02:15:19,550
they specifically targeted to blow up 
bridges where they'd be women and 

3303
02:15:19,550 --> 02:15:20,250
children.
So people would freak out.

3304
02:15:20,340 --> 02:15:23,550
They wanted as much cash as possible to 
start a revolution.

3305
02:15:23,551 --> 02:15:25,980
And in the chaos that according to this 
guy,

3306
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:29,460
they would cause the cast and that's 
when they would come in and take control

3307
02:15:29,461 --> 02:15:33,720
of the drugs and sell the arms to the 
rebels.

3308
02:15:33,750 --> 02:15:38,750
Like that was the formula.
Whether it's a latin american country 

3309
02:15:38,750 --> 02:15:41,460
like Nicaragua or wherever,
I mean El Salvador or wherever that was.

3310
02:15:41,461 --> 02:15:45,240
The plan is to go in there cause chaos 
arm the rebels,

3311
02:15:45,241 --> 02:15:49,410
sell them arms and blow shit up,
blame it on the commies,

3312
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,760
start a revolution.

3313
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:52,470
Try to assassinate,
again,

3314
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:56,640
according to the cia agents,
they're saying try to get the dictator,

3315
02:15:56,641 --> 02:15:58,800
assassinated,
and then the chaos.

3316
02:15:58,801 --> 02:16:02,550
They take control of all the drugs on 
natural resources,

3317
02:16:02,551 --> 02:16:04,570
oil and uh,
and selling.

3318
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:09,720
That's,
that's what the cia did according to 

3319
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:09,720
these guys.
That was the job master do it.

3320
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:10,020
TheY do it in,
in asia,

3321
02:16:10,110 --> 02:16:12,150
they do it in latin America,
they do it in the middle east,

3322
02:16:12,151 --> 02:16:13,860
cause chaos.
they want the cast.

3323
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:16,860
And then once the country's decimated 
that,

3324
02:16:16,861 --> 02:16:19,140
once the economy collapses because of 
all this chaos,

3325
02:16:19,410 --> 02:16:21,240
the international bankers come in,
boom,

3326
02:16:21,390 --> 02:16:24,600
and then they become the saviors.
They come in and save and then they,

3327
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:29,840
they,
they put in their own dictate and 

3328
02:16:29,840 --> 02:16:31,880
pulling out of control.
That whole country basically bankrupt 

3329
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:31,880
and then swoop

3330
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:31,880
over.
So it makes sense,

3331
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:36,181
right?
Like these gangsters and Arkansas with 

3332
02:16:36,181 --> 02:16:36,181
the state,
this is not a conspiracy theory.

3333
02:16:36,181 --> 02:16:38,260
Went down with the Iran contra hearings.
They got busted.

3334
02:16:38,261 --> 02:16:43,261
Ronald reagan and george senior,
the head of the cia is the vice 

3335
02:16:43,261 --> 02:16:44,970
president.
They get busted doing this and they know

3336
02:16:45,250 --> 02:16:46,810
Arkansas was whatever.
Bring it in.

3337
02:16:46,811 --> 02:16:49,270
And this is not a conspiracy theory,
this is exactly what happened.

3338
02:16:49,271 --> 02:16:51,550
So who was the governor of Arkansas 
when,

3339
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:53,710
when all this coat came through in the 
eighties,

3340
02:16:54,220 --> 02:16:56,800
bill clinton,
he was the one letting it all happen.

3341
02:16:56,980 --> 02:17:00,520
And then who takes over as president 
after george senior,

3342
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:05,730
the head of the cia,
once he steps down after he invades 

3343
02:17:05,730 --> 02:17:07,360
Iraq,
bill clinton is the president.

3344
02:17:07,450 --> 02:17:11,050
They're running together.
Bill clinton is hooking up george senior

3345
02:17:11,051 --> 02:17:15,370
by letting them use Arkansas and he 
becomes the president.

3346
02:17:15,580 --> 02:17:20,580
And then you watch their debates,
you go to youtube and watched their 

3347
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:20,580
debate and they're talking about sending
jobs overseas and,

3348
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:22,030
and uh,
and they're doing this with their hand,

3349
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,380
like they got this thing,
man,

3350
02:17:23,381 --> 02:17:24,520
this is,
I don't know what this is,

3351
02:17:24,521 --> 02:17:29,230
but this must mean something to make a 
point.

3352
02:17:30,230 --> 02:17:31,900
PresideNts really likes this.
Well,

3353
02:17:31,901 --> 02:17:34,180
you don't want to do this because this 
is aggressive.

3354
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:37,300
This is like,
you can trust me,

3355
02:17:37,390 --> 02:17:39,100
but you're not hitting anybody like 
this.

3356
02:17:40,580 --> 02:17:42,280
Not a fighter.
I'm going to,

3357
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:46,800
I'm going to lower taxes and we're going
to create more jobs stamp on.

3358
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:49,330
You hear them talking about this.
Sometimes you can gently do this.

3359
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,620
Yeah,
and knowing,

3360
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:55,710
knowing that their main Business is.
Bill clinton was hooking up george 

3361
02:17:55,710 --> 02:18:00,601
singer knowing this and then now they're
talking about the fucking balancing the 

3362
02:18:00,601 --> 02:18:01,090
budget.
It's hysterical.

3363
02:18:01,091 --> 02:18:06,091
It is like pro wrestling.
It's like their buddies behind the 

3364
02:18:06,091 --> 02:18:08,671
scene,
but on camera they're pretending like 

3365
02:18:08,671 --> 02:18:09,690
they're enemies,
but it's insane conspiracy story.

3366
02:18:10,010 --> 02:18:11,170
He was a cia agent,

3367
02:18:11,390 --> 02:18:14,540
1951 in France.
Suddenly,

3368
02:18:14,541 --> 02:18:18,620
mysteriously people struck down with 
mass insanity and hallucinations.

3369
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:23,800
At least five people died.
Dozens were interned in asylums and 

3370
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,290
hundreds of flicked it.
That's the facts.

3371
02:18:24,700 --> 02:18:29,700
And it was assumed that the local bread 
had been unwittingly poisoned with a 

3372
02:18:29,700 --> 02:18:30,530
psychedelic mold,
which happens.

3373
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:33,560
And that's what they're saying was 
responsible for the salem witch trials.

3374
02:18:33,920 --> 02:18:35,490
They said the salem witch trials,
they've,

3375
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:37,620
they've narrowed it down to,
um,

3376
02:18:38,060 --> 02:18:41,510
apparently when there's an early frost,
when you have a wheat harvest,

3377
02:18:41,690 --> 02:18:44,540
early frost can trigger the growth of 
god.

3378
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:49,900
Or god is a type of fungus that grows on
wheat that has many of the same 

3379
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:53,870
qualities as lsd.
So when you consume this bread with this

3380
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:56,210
[inaudible] got a wheat that has this or
god in it,

3381
02:18:56,390 --> 02:18:58,790
you trip your fucking brains out 
naturally,

3382
02:18:58,850 --> 02:19:03,850
naturally in a scary way because you 
imagine taking massive doses of acid in 

3383
02:19:03,891 --> 02:19:04,540
your brand.

3384
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:06,860
Even back then when your children are 
tripping out,

3385
02:19:06,861 --> 02:19:11,861
your children are freaking out.
Everyone thinks everyone's haunted and 

3386
02:19:11,861 --> 02:19:12,440
they just start drowning witches.
They're like,

3387
02:19:12,470 --> 02:19:13,930
you know,
that's insane.

3388
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:16,740
Or something like that.
Netflix about salem witch trials.

3389
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:18,520
So it was crazy.
We got a lot of people just thought that

3390
02:19:18,530 --> 02:19:21,560
they were being thrown under a spell,
know they,

3391
02:19:21,570 --> 02:19:23,180
they literally didn't realize what was 
going on.

3392
02:19:23,390 --> 02:19:27,140
So this,
they had blamed this shit on earth until

3393
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:33,040
and now they,
they believe that what's going on was 

3394
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:35,410
that the cia had cia documents that,
uh,

3395
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:40,420
this guy found while investigating this 
suspicious suicide of a man named Frank 

3396
02:19:40,420 --> 02:19:42,190
Olson,
who is a biochemist working for the sod,

3397
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:47,230
fell from the 13th floor window two 
years after the curse bread incident in 

3398
02:19:47,230 --> 02:19:51,341
France.
And one onenote transcribes the 

3399
02:19:51,341 --> 02:19:51,740
conversation between the cia agent and a
sandoz official.

3400
02:19:51,741 --> 02:19:55,550
Santos is the people that eventuallY 
started producing in mass quantities,

3401
02:19:55,551 --> 02:19:58,150
lsd.
They,

3402
02:19:58,190 --> 02:20:03,190
uh,
mentIoned the secret point st a esprit 

3403
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:07,060
experiment,
a point esprit st [inaudible] was where 

3404
02:20:07,060 --> 02:20:11,051
this all went down.
So they had mentioned it in a memo and 

3405
02:20:11,051 --> 02:20:11,420
explained that it was not at all caused 
by mold,

3406
02:20:11,690 --> 02:20:16,690
but by diane hamid that d and lsd said 
they had,

3407
02:20:17,390 --> 02:20:22,250
they had injected this shit into this 
town's bread supply just to watch it,

3408
02:20:22,700 --> 02:20:26,780
just to sort of,
just to absorb what happens when you get

3409
02:20:26,781 --> 02:20:30,230
a whole town on acid in 1951.
They dIdn't know any,

3410
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:35,290
you know,
they didn't really have all the data in 

3411
02:20:35,290 --> 02:20:35,290
1951.

3412
02:20:35,290 --> 02:20:35,290
It is.
I don't know anything about that,

3413
02:20:35,290 --> 02:20:38,060
but you're telling me that it's like 
they're fucking criminals.

3414
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:38,660
Yeah.
Well,

3415
02:20:38,661 --> 02:20:40,490
some of them were,
some of them are,

3416
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:42,170
you know,
some of them back then.

3417
02:20:42,440 --> 02:20:47,440
The,
my hope for real is that the internet 

3418
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,790
provides such an access to information,
such a,

3419
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:53,800
uh,
a boundary dissolving thing between 

3420
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:56,810
people and the truth that anything that 
happens from now to the future or from,

3421
02:20:56,840 --> 02:20:58,430
you know,
five years from now in the future,

3422
02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:03,850
everyone will be so accountable for 
their actions because it'll be so 

3423
02:21:03,850 --> 02:21:05,060
obvious and clear that they just won't 
be able to run things.

3424
02:21:05,061 --> 02:21:10,061
Businesses usual,
the corruption will slowly morphed down 

3425
02:21:10,061 --> 02:21:11,900
to a very reasonable level because it'll
all be transparent.

3426
02:21:11,990 --> 02:21:13,900
Yeah.
Like I remember,

3427
02:21:13,970 --> 02:21:18,970
you know,
there's so many different conspiracy 

3428
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:18,970
theories and,
and,

3429
02:21:18,970 --> 02:21:19,280
and you just don't have time to really 
look into them all.

3430
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:23,240
And I remember you being really into jfk
and I never really spent that much time.

3431
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:25,460
It just seemed like when someone would 
tell me that was,

3432
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:30,640
it was an inside job,
I just knowing what these criminals do 

3433
02:21:30,640 --> 02:21:30,770
and they're like,
okay,

3434
02:21:30,771 --> 02:21:32,090
I believe,
but I just haven't looked into it.

3435
02:21:32,091 --> 02:21:37,091
But recently,
just recently I've been obsessed with 

3436
02:21:37,091 --> 02:21:39,050
the jfk case.
It's amazing,

3437
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:40,340
man.
To think,

3438
02:21:40,400 --> 02:21:43,280
to think that all the stuff that I did 
spend time in,

3439
02:21:43,281 --> 02:21:47,000
that it's all connected all from world 
war ii,

3440
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:49,540
prescott bush,
george singer,

3441
02:21:49,580 --> 02:21:51,440
jfk,
nixon,

3442
02:21:51,590 --> 02:21:54,920
all the way up to george senior becoming
vice president,

3443
02:21:54,921 --> 02:21:56,990
ronald reagan,
bill clinton,

3444
02:21:57,020 --> 02:21:58,750
bam,
george w.

3445
02:21:59,270 --> 02:22:01,460
How dId that happen?
And then obama,

3446
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:06,880
all of it is all connected and it all 
has cii running right through it.

3447
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:09,800
Part of the average person on the 
ultimate,

3448
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:11,370
the underground right now.
Go ahead.

3449
02:22:11,490 --> 02:22:14,400
What the fuck are they talking about?
Conspiracy theories where Jeremy Stevens

3450
02:22:14,401 --> 02:22:19,401
on the pod training and diet and 
nutrition.

3451
02:22:22,200 --> 02:22:26,070
We do what we want to hear about this 
stuff

3452
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,020
man,
because honestly if it opens up a lot of

3453
02:22:28,021 --> 02:22:33,021
people's eyes to really stuff that's 
going on and you bring up a lot of good 

3454
02:22:33,021 --> 02:22:33,030
points,
like why aren't we seeing documents like

3455
02:22:33,031 --> 02:22:34,750
that in school that says,
you know,

3456
02:22:34,770 --> 02:22:37,920
george senior was cia type stuff and 
some of these events that were

3457
02:22:37,970 --> 02:22:40,280
pretty much history.
I mean he was the head of the cia.

3458
02:22:40,281 --> 02:22:41,800
That's,
that's history george sr.

3459
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:44,770
That alone is.
It's again,

3460
02:22:44,771 --> 02:22:47,220
that's not a conspiracy theory history.
That's insane.

3461
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:49,240
Well,
way more disturbing George Bush,

3462
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:52,640
but that's not,
that's kind of disturbing,

3463
02:22:52,670 --> 02:22:57,670
but George Bush senior being ahead of 
the cia's and natural progression going 

3464
02:22:57,670 --> 02:22:59,840
from one big top office to another kind 
of makes sense.

3465
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:03,500
What doesn't make sense at all?
And it's really scary is the dick cheney

3466
02:23:03,501 --> 02:23:06,860
halliburton connection.
The fact that dick cheney was the ceo of

3467
02:23:06,861 --> 02:23:08,240
halliburton.
He leaves.

3468
02:23:08,241 --> 02:23:10,850
Halliburton becomes a vice president.
I had states.

3469
02:23:10,970 --> 02:23:15,410
Then halliburton starts getting these no
bid contracts to rebuild Iraq.

3470
02:23:15,710 --> 02:23:19,220
I mean these huge multibillion dollar 
con,

3471
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:24,330
these contracts to rebuild Iraq,
a war that dick cheney's trying to get 

3472
02:23:24,330 --> 02:23:25,310
us into.
That's the tip of the iceberg.

3473
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:28,340
To think that that's only happening 
because of george senior.

3474
02:23:28,550 --> 02:23:33,550
When ronald reagan got busted,
they got busted wide open selling arms 

3475
02:23:34,521 --> 02:23:39,521
to the contracts.
They got busted in all the coke and 

3476
02:23:39,521 --> 02:23:43,240
nobody went to jail.
You think that stuff's going down over 

3477
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:43,240
north?
Took the oliver north,

3478
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:43,960
I think.
I think.

3479
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:45,250
I think that stuff is me.
I live.

3480
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:46,540
I live close right down.
I mean,

3481
02:23:46,541 --> 02:23:49,550
I lived in vista and uh,
chula vista,

3482
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:51,010
you know,
it's real close to the alliance chat,

3483
02:23:51,020 --> 02:23:53,980
but it's basically a true lawana and 
when you go down there and then like you

3484
02:23:53,981 --> 02:23:58,180
hear all these crazy like homeland 
stories about decide these drug cartels,

3485
02:23:58,181 --> 02:24:01,420
this net selling guns where they're 
getting these guns from in chula vista,

3486
02:24:01,740 --> 02:24:06,740
no one hunt chula vista in Mexico.
They're getting like an american guns 

3487
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:06,740
and,
and they're able to like,

3488
02:24:06,740 --> 02:24:11,660
you know,
basically like go down there and come 

3489
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:13,921
back up here.
Then they have like state stash houses 

3490
02:24:13,921 --> 02:24:15,430
and just like all this crazy stuff that 
goes on that,

3491
02:24:15,431 --> 02:24:20,431
you know,
you don't really think about what's 

3492
02:24:20,431 --> 02:24:20,431
going on right here in America too.

3493
02:24:20,431 --> 02:24:20,431
Ross,
he was on your show.

3494
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,650
He was saying that.
Yeah,

3495
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:26,990
I remember being 22 and some and I 
worked with a couple mexican gang banger

3496
02:24:26,991 --> 02:24:28,580
type dudes and we're deep in,
in,

3497
02:24:28,581 --> 02:24:30,620
in uh,
in the hood and mexican mafia.

3498
02:24:31,010 --> 02:24:32,750
And I remember them saying,
oh,

3499
02:24:32,751 --> 02:24:35,450
you think you don't think the government
brings in the drugs?

3500
02:24:35,451 --> 02:24:36,860
I Was like,
the government brings it.

3501
02:24:36,861 --> 02:24:39,380
I go,
you can you think we got airplanes?

3502
02:24:39,381 --> 02:24:44,381
How do you think the drugs get it?
And they looked at each other and 

3503
02:24:44,381 --> 02:24:44,381
laughed like I didn't know.
And I go,

3504
02:24:44,381 --> 02:24:46,850
you guys are insane.
The government brings the drugs in,

3505
02:24:46,851 --> 02:24:48,320
are you crazy?
And,

3506
02:24:48,410 --> 02:24:48,960
and,
uh,

3507
02:24:49,310 --> 02:24:54,310
it turns out that that's real.
And that's not a conspiracy theory 

3508
02:24:54,310 --> 02:24:58,091
that's documented.
You see that tunnel that they found 

3509
02:24:58,091 --> 02:24:58,100
recently in san diego that goes all the 
way to Mexico.

3510
02:24:58,430 --> 02:25:00,740
Super sophisticated.
The one electricity,

3511
02:25:00,741 --> 02:25:02,480
white lighting,
air conditioning,

3512
02:25:02,770 --> 02:25:06,020
hiring a new one.
They found many of these tunnels.

3513
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:06,210
Yeah,

3514
02:25:06,590 --> 02:25:11,590
go to big corporations or place where 
they can just pick up the drugs and all 

3515
02:25:11,590 --> 02:25:11,760
this stuff.
This stuff goes down.

3516
02:25:11,761 --> 02:25:12,300
It's insane.

3517
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:17,760
You live in san diego.
What is it like in san diego being so 

3518
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:17,890
close to Mexico being there?
It

3519
02:25:17,900 --> 02:25:22,900
honestly,
you don't even knoW the difference to 

3520
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:24,491
you go over there.
It's like we're over here paying for 

3521
02:25:24,491 --> 02:25:24,491
like this crazy market.
It's like

3522
02:25:24,491 --> 02:25:25,720
100 bucks.
You go to downtown san diego,

3523
02:25:25,960 --> 02:25:28,720
you go 30 minutes into,
into tiawana.

3524
02:25:28,721 --> 02:25:31,840
You get the best fish your life for just
dollars,

3525
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:32,810
you know?
So it's,

3526
02:25:32,811 --> 02:25:34,420
it's a lot cheaper.
But you know,

3527
02:25:34,421 --> 02:25:34,730
the,
the,

3528
02:25:34,731 --> 02:25:37,570
the culture is way different.
There's a lot of different things.

3529
02:25:37,571 --> 02:25:40,600
Like san diego has a way laid back vibe.
Everybody's cool.

3530
02:25:40,601 --> 02:25:44,020
It's like nothing going on.
But realize that like a half hour away,

3531
02:25:44,021 --> 02:25:49,021
there's shootings every day that's going
down and just their buildings look a 

3532
02:25:49,021 --> 02:25:49,870
little a lot more ghetto and just the 
way they live,

3533
02:25:50,110 --> 02:25:55,110
you almost when you go back and you have
that type of experience being over 

3534
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:57,811
there,
you almost just appreciate going into a 

3535
02:25:57,811 --> 02:25:57,811
clean neighborhood,
you know,

3536
02:25:57,811 --> 02:25:58,390
driving by.
That makes sense.

3537
02:25:58,450 --> 02:26:01,630
What is it like being that close?
You never think about it.

3538
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:03,270
Do you ever hear about it?
Spilling over.

3539
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:05,230
You hear about kidnappings,
you hear about,

3540
02:26:05,570 --> 02:26:07,630
you hear a lot,
you hear a lot of stuff,

3541
02:26:07,631 --> 02:26:07,780
you know.

3542
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:09,700
And then like sometimes there's like 
helicopters flying,

3543
02:26:09,701 --> 02:26:11,170
like have you seen this guy?
Whatever,

3544
02:26:11,171 --> 02:26:16,171
blah blah blah blah blah.
So kidnappings because it's easy to get 

3545
02:26:16,171 --> 02:26:16,171
back into Mexico.
Yeah.

3546
02:26:16,171 --> 02:26:18,900
Getting back into Mexico is like human 
trafficking in drugs that you know,

3547
02:26:19,010 --> 02:26:24,010
people that are stuff that people are 
making movies on and making millioNs of 

3548
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:24,010
dollars,
you know,

3549
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:24,010
that's,
that's all cool.

3550
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:25,820
But that stuff really goes down.
You know,

3551
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:28,990
there's a big war on drugs and,
and like you said that,

3552
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:34,530
you know,
you hear about people like governments 

3553
02:26:34,530 --> 02:26:36,391
funding and this and stuff.
I mean where do you think they're 

3554
02:26:36,391 --> 02:26:36,391
getting these type of guns in this type 
of muscle?

3555
02:26:36,391 --> 02:26:38,120
Because the drug cartel will basically,
they'll,

3556
02:26:38,140 --> 02:26:41,410
they'll buy,
they'll buy like say like say joe rogan.

3557
02:26:41,411 --> 02:26:46,411
You're,
you're like an army general guy and you 

3558
02:26:46,411 --> 02:26:46,411
know,
you know,

3559
02:26:46,411 --> 02:26:48,630
some secret stuff on weapons and you're 
only getting paid $100 a week to feed 

3560
02:26:48,630 --> 02:26:50,050
your family and they're like,
tell you what,

3561
02:26:50,051 --> 02:26:51,400
we're going to pay you $100,000.

3562
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:52,930
We're going to put you and your family 
and in a,

3563
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:54,280
in a house,
whatever.

3564
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:56,860
but if you mess up or if you do anything
wrong will kill you.

3565
02:26:56,861 --> 02:26:58,240
Your whole family.
And then some,

3566
02:26:58,720 --> 02:26:59,370
you know,
so they'll,

3567
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:02,650
they'll take like head corporate people 
that know how to build like a,

3568
02:27:02,660 --> 02:27:07,660
they'll building submarines,
they'll get these people in the jungle 

3569
02:27:07,660 --> 02:27:10,621
that know how to build this stuff and 
then they'll submarine hundreds and 

3570
02:27:10,621 --> 02:27:11,750
millions of dollars of drug cartel and 
it's,

3571
02:27:11,880 --> 02:27:12,910
it's insane.
You know,

3572
02:27:12,911 --> 02:27:14,670
and this stuff actually goes down.
I wonder if.

3573
02:27:14,900 --> 02:27:18,070
Can you imagine if there was like a map 
I can overlay of the United States.

3574
02:27:18,071 --> 02:27:23,030
We could just theoretically watch like a
highlight of all the cocaine both

3575
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:26,800
come in on daily basis,
but there's a big shipment right there,

3576
02:27:26,801 --> 02:27:28,730
joe.
As crazy as that is

3577
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:31,010
forcement couldn't see it.
But you can see it.

3578
02:27:31,250 --> 02:27:33,860
law enforcement gets paid off,
not see it or they do are they?

3579
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:38,880
Well,
it's crazy as that is and that all does 

3580
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:40,741
exist.
All these cartels are real according to 

3581
02:27:40,741 --> 02:27:42,220
these ex cia agents and all the stuff 
that was going on in mena,

3582
02:27:42,580 --> 02:27:47,580
that's a small,
tiny fraction compared to what the cia 

3583
02:27:47,580 --> 02:27:50,671
is dumping.
And they're bringing in giant fucking 

3584
02:27:50,671 --> 02:27:51,610
military planes filled with tons and 
tons of coke and the,

3585
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:52,540
the,
the carton.

3586
02:27:52,570 --> 02:27:54,340
Then every now and then they'll bust a 
little cartel,

3587
02:27:54,341 --> 02:27:55,570
put it on the news and say,
look,

3588
02:27:55,571 --> 02:27:55,900
we're,
we're,

3589
02:27:55,901 --> 02:27:58,140
we're doing our best to stop this.
Watch the lord,

3590
02:27:58,141 --> 02:27:58,170
lord

3591
02:27:58,170 --> 02:27:59,280
of the skies,
that documentary,

3592
02:27:59,281 --> 02:28:04,281
like you're talking,
I'm going to go home and watch that 

3593
02:28:04,281 --> 02:28:04,281
clinton chronicles.
But,

3594
02:28:04,281 --> 02:28:04,281
uh,
I'm not for sure the spanish word of it,

3595
02:28:04,281 --> 02:28:08,721
but a checkout the lord of the skies.
That guy was that he was the most 

3596
02:28:08,721 --> 02:28:09,680
biggest powerful drug dealer.
And uh,

3597
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:12,480
there's another guy down there right now
that's a,

3598
02:28:12,481 --> 02:28:17,481
that's coming up,
but no one says that there's anybody 

3599
02:28:17,481 --> 02:28:17,481
like this guy.
They called the lord of the sky.

3600
02:28:17,481 --> 02:28:22,190
This guy barry seal,
sky funded the whole government and the 

3601
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:22,310
government was protecting

3602
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:23,250
them.
He was buYing police.

3603
02:28:23,860 --> 02:28:25,640
That's gotta be barry seal's.
He's the,

3604
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:30,670
he's the most famous biggest.
You're talking about a guy that's the 

3605
02:28:30,670 --> 02:28:30,710
live now?
No,

3606
02:28:30,711 --> 02:28:31,700
he's dead.
I guess like,

3607
02:28:31,701 --> 02:28:36,701
he came over here for surgery,
like in san diego and was into plastic 

3608
02:28:36,701 --> 02:28:36,701
surgery to,
to change his life,

3609
02:28:36,701 --> 02:28:38,690
look like.
He's like Iran type crazy stuff.

3610
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:44,080
And uh,
he died during the surgery that 

3611
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:44,080
supposedly.
But then there's like comparisons,

3612
02:28:44,080 --> 02:28:44,930
conspiracy theorists that are like,
no,

3613
02:28:44,931 --> 02:28:46,280
he didn't die.
He escaped.

3614
02:28:46,450 --> 02:28:51,450
You know,
because I'm sure you heard of el chapo 

3615
02:28:51,450 --> 02:28:51,450
guzman who escaped from a high security 
prison,

3616
02:28:51,480 --> 02:28:54,410
escaped and quotes escaped a high 
security.

3617
02:28:56,020 --> 02:28:57,660
You got billions of dollars,
man.

3618
02:28:57,830 --> 02:28:58,960
Billions.
And then that.

3619
02:28:59,070 --> 02:29:01,790
That's funny.
Have you seen the documentary,

3620
02:29:01,791 --> 02:29:03,770
the two escobars?
no,

3621
02:29:03,790 --> 02:29:07,620
I haven't got to see the two escobars,
one of the greatest documentary bro.

3622
02:29:07,910 --> 02:29:12,910
Fucking glory.
You see how he picks up when you're 

3623
02:29:12,910 --> 02:29:12,920
talking about conspiracy theories about 
pablo escobar,

3624
02:29:12,921 --> 02:29:13,380
but this is not.

3625
02:29:13,380 --> 02:29:14,450
It has nothing to do.
Conspiracy.

3626
02:29:14,451 --> 02:29:17,180
This is one of the biggest drug lords 
ever.

3627
02:29:17,181 --> 02:29:22,181
Pablo escobar.
And it's about him and how he got 

3628
02:29:22,181 --> 02:29:22,740
involved with soccer and columbia and 
how he,

3629
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:25,310
he'll,
he almost became political,

3630
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:30,700
but then there was a backlash of the 
things that he was doing because they 

3631
02:29:30,700 --> 02:29:32,030
loved him like a god down there.
Like he was feeding The poor.

3632
02:29:32,180 --> 02:29:33,960
Like he was doing this crazy stuff with 
like his,

3633
02:29:33,961 --> 02:29:38,961
his drug money.
But he just didn't want anybody messing 

3634
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:38,961
with his family.
But he was feeding the poor.

3635
02:29:38,961 --> 02:29:40,430
He was doing so much for politics.
Well,

3636
02:29:40,431 --> 02:29:42,130
there was a lot of killing going on,
which,

3637
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,460
which is involved in drugs,
you know,

3638
02:29:43,461 --> 02:29:48,461
a lot of families were dying so then 
there was a big retaliation toward him 

3639
02:29:48,461 --> 02:29:49,580
and the things that were going on.
So then like the politics,

3640
02:29:49,581 --> 02:29:50,510
like cut them off.
I was like,

3641
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:52,070
well we can't be associated with that.

3642
02:29:52,070 --> 02:29:54,260
Not not like if people know you like 
this,

3643
02:29:54,261 --> 02:29:56,180
so two weeks in a month.
That's it right there.

3644
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,260
Yeah.
What he did,

3645
02:29:57,790 --> 02:30:02,640
what he did was alert is a.
They wanted,

3646
02:30:02,810 --> 02:30:03,290
he was,
you know,

3647
02:30:03,291 --> 02:30:08,291
obviously he was helping the poor and he
was building houses and he was really 

3648
02:30:08,291 --> 02:30:10,460
into soccer building,
little soccer field all over the ghettos

3649
02:30:10,461 --> 02:30:13,280
and he raised a bad,
a bad ass soccer players.

3650
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:17,660
That's why columbia ended up going to 
the world cup because he raised them all

3651
02:30:17,661 --> 02:30:22,661
the,
all the guys on the colombian soccer 

3652
02:30:22,661 --> 02:30:22,661
team that made it to the world cup.
This I think was 93.

3653
02:30:22,661 --> 02:30:24,950
They're like,
why is pablo escobar in the audience?

3654
02:30:24,951 --> 02:30:27,000
Why does he have like vip?
No one really knew that.

3655
02:30:27,001 --> 02:30:29,030
I just thought it was just they,
when you looked into it,

3656
02:30:29,180 --> 02:30:31,190
he knew all those guys.
He raised Them up as kids.

3657
02:30:31,191 --> 02:30:32,900
He was really super into soccer.

3658
02:30:32,900 --> 02:30:35,620
You ever had anybody try to get you to 
dump a fight?

3659
02:30:36,220 --> 02:30:41,220
And pablo escobar type gangster dude.
I bet a lot of money because I was like,

3660
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:43,810
I'm always into like,
you know,

3661
02:30:43,970 --> 02:30:45,920
conspiracies.
I watched your stuff and,

3662
02:30:46,250 --> 02:30:48,830
and I always liked his pick and choose 
and like I get into stuff like that.

3663
02:30:48,831 --> 02:30:53,831
But one thing that's always interested 
me and I've never been involved in it 

3664
02:30:53,831 --> 02:30:53,831
was just drugs,
drug cartels.

3665
02:30:53,831 --> 02:30:54,330
I actually,
you know,

3666
02:30:54,840 --> 02:30:56,810
I grew up from a family where were,
you know,

3667
02:30:56,811 --> 02:31:00,220
there's a drug problem in the household 
and which is the reason why like I,

3668
02:31:00,280 --> 02:31:05,280
you know,
I kind of live porn in the ghetto and 

3669
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:07,151
stuff like that.
So then when I hear about these Drug 

3670
02:31:07,151 --> 02:31:08,150
cartels and these big billionaires that 
just come from nothing,

3671
02:31:08,151 --> 02:31:10,730
these guys come from like you'll hear 
her talking about being poor,

3672
02:31:10,790 --> 02:31:15,790
helping their parents,
parents farm and they never wanted to 

3673
02:31:15,790 --> 02:31:18,821
live like that.
They wanted to live large and they had 

3674
02:31:18,821 --> 02:31:18,821
these dreams of just envisioning this,
ah,

3675
02:31:18,821 --> 02:31:19,770
this stuff.
And they're on their way up,

3676
02:31:19,771 --> 02:31:20,050
you know,
they

3677
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:22,500
got to do some crazy things to get,
you know,

3678
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:25,320
heavy wears the crown they say.
So it's crazy.

3679
02:31:25,321 --> 02:31:30,321
Some of the,
some of their stories and interesting 

3680
02:31:30,321 --> 02:31:30,321
facts and,
and I,

3681
02:31:30,321 --> 02:31:30,321
I kinda like it,
you know,

3682
02:31:30,321 --> 02:31:30,321
so

3683
02:31:30,321 --> 02:31:34,790
yeah,
they wanted to the us one or to 

3684
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:36,660
extradite him and throw him in jail in 
the states for all the shit he was 

3685
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:37,650
doing.
And uh,

3686
02:31:37,651 --> 02:31:39,840
pablo escobar went to the government and
said,

3687
02:31:39,841 --> 02:31:44,841
I want you,
if you rewrite the constitution or 

3688
02:31:44,841 --> 02:31:46,920
rewrite the law that says you cannot be 
extradited,

3689
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:49,200
I will go to prison here.
I will,

3690
02:31:49,630 --> 02:31:51,650
you,
you can have me in prison and build own.

3691
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:53,370
And then they said,
fuck that.

3692
02:31:53,371 --> 02:31:54,360
And they,
they,

3693
02:31:54,361 --> 02:31:59,361
uh,
they thought he killed a lot of 

3694
02:31:59,361 --> 02:31:59,361
politicians.
I was like,

3695
02:31:59,361 --> 02:32:02,151
wars on the street.
And there was so much bloodshed that 

3696
02:32:02,151 --> 02:32:02,151
they finally said,
okay,

3697
02:32:02,151 --> 02:32:03,350
we are changing the god damn law.
We,

3698
02:32:03,370 --> 02:32:04,980
you know,
now go to jail.

3699
02:32:05,070 --> 02:32:07,020
So he goes to the jail.
And meanwhile,

3700
02:32:07,021 --> 02:32:10,200
that whole time he built the jail,
he set it up,

3701
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:12,360
he had nightclubs in their tunnels to 
escape.

3702
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:14,730
They had no idea that he went to his own
jail.

3703
02:32:14,850 --> 02:32:17,030
He was part,
he was leaving anytime he wanted.

3704
02:32:17,610 --> 02:32:22,610
This is all in the documentary.
So when they finally figured it out 

3705
02:32:22,610 --> 02:32:24,050
because they took it,
they uh,

3706
02:32:24,180 --> 02:32:29,180
arrested his rival rival drug cartel,
they send them into prison and he was 

3707
02:32:29,180 --> 02:32:29,520
right there in his own prison.
So they murdered them.

3708
02:32:29,700 --> 02:32:31,920
So once they find out that they figured 
out the,

3709
02:32:31,930 --> 02:32:33,960
oh shit,
he's running this jail.

3710
02:32:34,170 --> 02:32:35,520
They went there and he was gone.
Dude,

3711
02:32:35,521 --> 02:32:37,740
he had escaped tunnels to get a 
nightclub there.

3712
02:32:37,741 --> 02:32:40,020
He had his soccer fields.
They,

3713
02:32:40,021 --> 02:32:40,500
they,
they,

3714
02:32:40,501 --> 02:32:41,030
uh,
you know,

3715
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:42,270
he ended up dying later,

3716
02:32:42,610 --> 02:32:43,860
but they chased them down.
Right.

3717
02:32:43,861 --> 02:32:44,980
And killed him.
Assassinated him.

3718
02:32:45,210 --> 02:32:45,900
Yeah.
Yeah.

3719
02:32:45,940 --> 02:32:48,880
Apparently columbia's awesome now.
Apparently columbia,

3720
02:32:48,881 --> 02:32:50,920
like the drug problems,
like a thing of the past.

3721
02:32:50,921 --> 02:32:53,590
It's like a nice safe place to be.
It's interesting,

3722
02:32:53,591 --> 02:32:54,190
man.
Columbia,

3723
02:32:54,200 --> 02:32:55,060
it's crazy.
Yeah.

3724
02:32:55,061 --> 02:32:57,640
It's interesting how that,
that can have a hot box out there.

3725
02:32:57,641 --> 02:32:59,370
10 planet budding kia.
Oh yeah,

3726
02:32:59,390 --> 02:33:00,820
yeah.
Those guys are savages.

3727
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,510
Isn't it interesting that,
you know,

3728
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:07,780
places can go and come and I wonder what
the fuck's going to happen in the 

3729
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:07,780
future?
Mexico,

3730
02:33:07,780 --> 02:33:08,490
because when I was a kid,
man,

3731
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:10,680
Mexico was a bad ass place to be.
Yeah,

3732
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:13,120
you could go over there a lot easier to 
go to cancun.

3733
02:33:13,160 --> 02:33:18,160
People always want to cancun.
Everybody need never heard anything 

3734
02:33:18,160 --> 02:33:18,880
about violence in Mexico.
Mexico was like a nice chill place.

3735
02:33:19,150 --> 02:33:21,910
He thought of people with fucking 
margarita is chilling on the beach,

3736
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:23,560
you know,
he didn't think of dudes.

3737
02:33:23,561 --> 02:33:25,220
Cut and do the heads off.
I was worried.

3738
02:33:25,360 --> 02:33:27,260
Beautiful places like not saying that 
it's like bad,

3739
02:33:27,261 --> 02:33:27,890
you know,
bad or you know,

3740
02:33:27,940 --> 02:33:32,940
Mexico has some pretty cool ancient 
stuff like over there with like line up 

3741
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:32,940
with the stars,
you know.

3742
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,690
So I'm noT dogging on Mexico by any 
means.

3743
02:33:34,691 --> 02:33:35,170
Mexico,
they,

3744
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:36,750
they're very humble people.
You ever noticed that?

3745
02:33:37,180 --> 02:33:39,400
Mexican people always take care of you.
You can.

3746
02:33:39,401 --> 02:33:40,930
You know,
you go to a mexican families house,

3747
02:33:40,931 --> 02:33:45,931
you know you're eating good food there.
Their manners and others are trying to 

3748
02:33:45,931 --> 02:33:46,330
take care of your family or a quarter 
mexican.

3749
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:49,250
I'm a quarter mexican,
my girls 100 percent mexican come

3750
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:51,790
from a mexican background.
Nice.

3751
02:33:52,010 --> 02:33:52,730
Yeah.
I love it.

3752
02:33:52,731 --> 02:33:54,920
And they take care of me.
Great mexican fighters,

3753
02:33:54,921 --> 02:33:59,921
man.
You want to talk about one nationality 

3754
02:33:59,921 --> 02:34:00,460
that has produced incredible boxers.
pretty good.

3755
02:34:00,500 --> 02:34:02,000
Fuck yeah.
He looked great.

3756
02:34:02,170 --> 02:34:04,700
he looked like he's improving for sure.
Cain velasquez,

3757
02:34:04,730 --> 02:34:06,740
do you know that?
Do it well.

3758
02:34:06,770 --> 02:34:11,770
My mother was born in America son.
Finally we got a mexican heavyweight 

3759
02:34:12,710 --> 02:34:17,710
boxing american born here,
a cello favorite.

3760
02:34:17,950 --> 02:34:18,300
Taylor

3761
02:34:18,330 --> 02:34:20,050
refined them.
He turned to him pretty good.

3762
02:34:20,051 --> 02:34:22,060
I imagine about being a director.
Tell,

3763
02:34:22,061 --> 02:34:22,290
so

3764
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:27,520
I don't think he would mind knowing what
kind of a beating he's going to give 

3765
02:34:27,520 --> 02:34:28,400
child the end of it.
Cain valasquez would do in boxing.

3766
02:34:29,390 --> 02:34:30,200
Oh,
who knows?

3767
02:34:30,201 --> 02:34:31,760
I mean he would have to get really good 
at it.

3768
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:32,570
You know,
there's a.

3769
02:34:32,650 --> 02:34:34,790
There's a big difference between a guy 
like,

3770
02:34:34,791 --> 02:34:37,720
like let's say andre ward.
See andre ward's fight this weekend.

3771
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,160
He fought this dude who was a serious 
knockout.

3772
02:34:40,161 --> 02:34:41,420
Punch her,
I forget the guy's name,

3773
02:34:41,750 --> 02:34:45,140
but a andre words.
just box circles around them and it just

3774
02:34:45,230 --> 02:34:47,300
cracked him.
Hit him with some big shots,

3775
02:34:47,530 --> 02:34:49,400
you know,
like basically dominated him,

3776
02:34:49,401 --> 02:34:54,180
but this guy was a bad ass fucking boxer
and he's a really high level box guy.

3777
02:34:54,181 --> 02:34:56,960
Was undefeated,
a big knockout record.

3778
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:02,760
Just a big difference between a guy 
who's a guy that's good at boxing and 

3779
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:04,820
mma when there's all these other 
techniques,

3780
02:35:04,821 --> 02:35:07,430
especially guys like king is such a 
great wrestler.

3781
02:35:07,700 --> 02:35:12,700
I mean his name is all about 
transitioning from striking the take 

3782
02:35:12,700 --> 02:35:12,840
down,
take down,

3783
02:35:12,870 --> 02:35:17,870
striking meaningful.
If a boxer wanted to fight him and then 

3784
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:17,870
maybe he would kill him,
kill him,

3785
02:35:17,870 --> 02:35:22,040
but he would have to really absorb the 
game of boxing to compete as a box.

3786
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:24,990
Has the best chance to be came to.
And that's fine.

3787
02:35:25,570 --> 02:35:28,300
No man,
I don't know.

3788
02:35:28,310 --> 02:35:30,800
He's been knocked out.
I think travis browne coming up.

3789
02:35:30,890 --> 02:35:33,680
Yeah.
Try like travis scott and josh.

3790
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:39,910
Josh barnett,
catch them with the submission or 

3791
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:39,910
something that would be a guy that,
that uh,

3792
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:42,320
would eventually,
you know what josh can take came down.

3793
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:46,080
Who knows my most likely no,
I don't know,

3794
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:47,960
but I think that would be good range and
be able to.

3795
02:35:47,961 --> 02:35:49,210
Russell and russell,
I'm off them.

3796
02:35:49,260 --> 02:35:54,260
Then maybe take them down.
Who knows what josh barnett is gonna 

3797
02:35:54,260 --> 02:35:54,260
show up,
you know this guy,

3798
02:35:54,260 --> 02:35:54,260
this guy,
you know,

3799
02:35:54,260 --> 02:35:56,120
he's.
He's dealt with a lot of past stuff,

3800
02:35:56,121 --> 02:35:57,680
but I think when you get back in the 
ufc,

3801
02:35:57,681 --> 02:36:02,681
especially not this time,
I think he might be rejuvenated in this 

3802
02:36:02,681 --> 02:36:03,350
fight with travis browne is a huge 
fight.

3803
02:36:03,351 --> 02:36:06,620
Travis browne is definitely young talent
to do it on his way up.

3804
02:36:06,621 --> 02:36:08,240
He's hungry.
I know he's working hard,

3805
02:36:08,241 --> 02:36:10,670
so these two are really going to set the
standard.

3806
02:36:10,671 --> 02:36:15,671
Who,
who wants to take It to that next level 

3807
02:36:15,671 --> 02:36:15,671
and go up there and challenge came for 
that belt.

3808
02:36:15,671 --> 02:36:15,750
so great fucking fight,
man.

3809
02:36:15,780 --> 02:36:17,590
Huge freshly coming off your foster.

3810
02:36:18,240 --> 02:36:18,960
Let me tell you something,
man.

3811
02:36:18,961 --> 02:36:20,870
There's not a lot of heavyweights on the
planet.

3812
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:24,000
They have stood that beating that he 
took in that first round from

3813
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:27,350
just insane doodles,
but I forgot.

3814
02:36:27,351 --> 02:36:29,240
I need like that bro.
I just give me a second.

3815
02:36:29,740 --> 02:36:32,750
His knees are so much harder than 
everybody else's.

3816
02:36:32,840 --> 02:36:34,610
He throws him so different.
Unlike anybody.

3817
02:36:34,611 --> 02:36:37,820
He's like one tuesday and then just 
bombard you with this knee.

3818
02:36:37,850 --> 02:36:39,210
The ruthless.
It's crazy.

3819
02:36:39,290 --> 02:36:41,490
It's like getting hit over and over 
again with a battery graham.

3820
02:36:42,080 --> 02:36:45,050
But somehow or another travis browne 
gutted through that shit.

3821
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:47,270
Literally got it through it.
He's amazing.

3822
02:36:47,330 --> 02:36:48,650
Yeah.
They got up in front,

3823
02:36:48,651 --> 02:36:50,480
kicked him in the face and the same 
round.

3824
02:36:50,850 --> 02:36:51,740
I mean crazy.

3825
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:56,800
You know what man,
if you get kicked in the face one time 

3826
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:56,800
you'd be like,
okay,

3827
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:56,800
you got me.
I'm,

3828
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:56,800
I'm still a lot,
you know,

3829
02:36:56,800 --> 02:36:59,200
if you're still conscious.
But he kicked him in the face like two,

3830
02:36:59,210 --> 02:37:00,920
three times and he was just leaning 
toward it,

3831
02:37:00,921 --> 02:37:01,520
you know?
I was like,

3832
02:37:01,521 --> 02:37:04,640
don't move.
Just shot his wife.

3833
02:37:04,830 --> 02:37:09,830
He just,
the snap kicks to the chest into the 

3834
02:37:11,601 --> 02:37:12,950
jaw.
That ain't no joke.

3835
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:15,140
You see,
you're seeing them a lot.

3836
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,040
You didn't see them two

3837
02:37:16,040 --> 02:37:17,020
years ago.
How about all,

3838
02:37:17,120 --> 02:37:18,980
are you throwing those snapchat

3839
02:37:19,640 --> 02:37:22,670
and his last fight and try to throw them
at me and I was push and I was like,

3840
02:37:22,700 --> 02:37:23,380
hold up.
You know,

3841
02:37:23,390 --> 02:37:28,390
like they're,
they're deceiving because like all of a 

3842
02:37:28,390 --> 02:37:30,611
sudden this guy,
I normally look at the chest when I 

3843
02:37:30,611 --> 02:37:32,741
fight because I can,
I can tell where his hips are going to 

3844
02:37:32,741 --> 02:37:35,261
be.
I could see his base and I can see his 

3845
02:37:35,261 --> 02:37:37,271
feet and I could see where his hands are
lined up so I know I want to keep like 

3846
02:37:37,271 --> 02:37:37,271
good range,
but those,

3847
02:37:37,271 --> 02:37:41,520
those kicks,
they're deceiving because you got to 

3848
02:37:41,520 --> 02:37:43,570
raise them with like your knee,
so it's like your elbow going through 

3849
02:37:43,570 --> 02:37:46,451
first to hit like a baseball.
So the elbow always leads just like the 

3850
02:37:46,451 --> 02:37:47,530
knees so the knee pops up.
You don't know if he's still in like a,

3851
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:52,560
like maybe a fake back knee,
but it happened so quick and it pops 

3852
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:52,560
right in your face

3853
02:37:52,560 --> 02:37:57,290
quick.
It's amazing that we've gone this long 

3854
02:37:57,290 --> 02:37:59,870
in the ufc and we just figured out this 
old basic ass karate party is actually 

3855
02:38:00,211 --> 02:38:04,140
really useful.
We're nobody practiced it.

3856
02:38:04,380 --> 02:38:06,230
Nobody bad.
And then they,

3857
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:11,240
jim after mma gym was.
They're striking coaches telling their 

3858
02:38:11,240 --> 02:38:11,820
students not to throw those.
Oh,

3859
02:38:11,860 --> 02:38:16,140
those don't work time after time we see 
how much of a follow the leader thing is

3860
02:38:16,141 --> 02:38:21,141
going on in mma because a guy like 
anderson lands that front kick and 

3861
02:38:21,141 --> 02:38:23,610
knocks out vittorio and the whole sport 
changes like overnight.

3862
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:28,850
Everyone's thrown in front.
Josh thompson storing them like a 

3863
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:28,900
motherfucker.
Anthony pettis is throwing crazy kicks.

3864
02:38:29,180 --> 02:38:30,870
Crazy knees like I do.
I think.

3865
02:38:31,190 --> 02:38:35,430
I think we know now that all these crazy
kicks do work.

3866
02:38:35,431 --> 02:38:40,431
You just got to have good balance and 
good wrestling and you got to make sure 

3867
02:38:40,431 --> 02:38:41,560
that if you get taken down that you can 
pop right back up or you have good,

3868
02:38:41,810 --> 02:38:42,040
good.

3869
02:38:42,050 --> 02:38:47,050
You just said the only reason they 
weren't working because the only people 

3870
02:38:47,050 --> 02:38:47,700
that knew how to throw all of them 
didn't know how to fight on the ground.

3871
02:38:47,701 --> 02:38:50,960
so we went through a dark period where 
we have to take away these,

3872
02:38:50,990 --> 02:38:55,990
these techniques going to disappear for 
awhile until the wrestling and the 

3873
02:38:55,990 --> 02:38:59,721
striking merge as one.
It's just so interesting to see these 

3874
02:38:59,721 --> 02:39:01,920
guys that are coming up that are 
throwing these games,

3875
02:39:02,220 --> 02:39:07,220
throwing these techniques at people that
you never saw like [inaudible] landon 

3876
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:07,770
that we'll kick on.
Luke rockhold do.

3877
02:39:07,771 --> 02:39:09,060
They're throwing.
We'll kicks all the time.

3878
02:39:09,061 --> 02:39:12,780
I guess like a jab.
It's good even in my stryker,

3879
02:39:12,810 --> 02:39:15,780
but in my opinion,
it just seems that if you at least throw

3880
02:39:15,781 --> 02:39:17,220
me,
even though the heartland sometimes,

3881
02:39:17,221 --> 02:39:19,320
but you throw them,
it takes a guy off his game was like,

3882
02:39:19,350 --> 02:39:24,350
oh,
this guy's willing to throw these 

3883
02:39:24,350 --> 02:39:25,491
motherfuckers.
See jorge mosby doll and rostom tom 

3884
02:39:25,491 --> 02:39:25,980
hobby lobby.
I saw the fight.

3885
02:39:26,010 --> 02:39:27,260
Don't remember it.
Hobby live.

3886
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:29,690
We'll kicked him in the neck like out of
nowhere.

3887
02:39:29,890 --> 02:39:30,850
Near hobby.
Lava.

3888
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:35,100
Rock them though have been badly hurt.
Take it man.

3889
02:39:35,310 --> 02:39:38,490
But he caught him in the neck with a 
wheel kick like out of nowhere.

3890
02:39:38,491 --> 02:39:40,990
And uh,
nowhere like straight grappler.

3891
02:39:42,110 --> 02:39:44,930
That's what catches him as people.
People willing to take the risks.

3892
02:39:44,931 --> 02:39:46,970
A lot of people have a lot of good 
arsenals,

3893
02:39:46,980 --> 02:39:49,070
like in their tools,
but they're like in the fight,

3894
02:39:49,080 --> 02:39:50,540
man.
They'll just stick to the basics.

3895
02:39:50,541 --> 02:39:55,541
Are not willing to risk it,
but those people that when somebody 

3896
02:39:55,541 --> 02:39:55,990
throws something spinning at you,
you almost like look at him like,

3897
02:39:56,150 --> 02:39:57,980
all right bro,
this guy wants to risk everything.

3898
02:39:57,981 --> 02:39:58,730
Okay,
I like that.

3899
02:39:58,880 --> 02:40:00,770
Let's get after it.
You know you're willing to

3900
02:40:00,800 --> 02:40:01,700
throw down like,
okay,

3901
02:40:01,701 --> 02:40:04,830
this guy's willing to risk risk trying 
to knock me out and I've got a risk risk

3902
02:40:04,831 --> 02:40:09,831
something,
but if you just sit back and let it 

3903
02:40:09,831 --> 02:40:09,831
happen,
you're not really taking any risks.

3904
02:40:09,831 --> 02:40:09,831
You're not really getting any reward 
either.

3905
02:40:09,831 --> 02:40:12,440
One thing I want to say about gsp is 
yes,

3906
02:40:12,441 --> 02:40:13,950
I think.
I think he lost and yes

3907
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,530
it was a bad decision.
Just look at his face,

3908
02:40:16,710 --> 02:40:21,710
but I admired gsp for going forward,
sticking to his game plan.

3909
02:40:22,441 --> 02:40:25,580
He was throwing down the whole time he 
was going forward.

3910
02:40:25,590 --> 02:40:27,060
He got rocked and he backed up a little 
bit,

3911
02:40:27,061 --> 02:40:30,390
but generally in that fight he was stone
head kicks like a motherfucker.

3912
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:32,640
He was throwing big right hand.
He was.

3913
02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:35,130
He's a true warrior,
ms dot proud champion.

3914
02:40:35,160 --> 02:40:36,420
It seemed,
it seemed like in the.

3915
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:38,550
It really seemed like after the first 
round,

3916
02:40:38,551 --> 02:40:41,250
he already started gassing,
but he was breathing really heavy,

3917
02:40:41,370 --> 02:40:44,490
but he kept going forward.
You hit hard.

3918
02:40:44,570 --> 02:40:44,760
Yeah.

3919
02:40:45,940 --> 02:40:48,220
I've kind of felt bad for him in the,
in the press conference,

3920
02:40:48,580 --> 02:40:50,770
you know,
there's no taken away gsp that he's not,

3921
02:40:50,771 --> 02:40:51,650
he's not a gamer,
that he's,

3922
02:40:51,720 --> 02:40:54,110
he's willing to do what it takes.
And uh,

3923
02:40:54,170 --> 02:40:55,840
he,
he almost seemed like he's just like,

3924
02:40:55,841 --> 02:40:56,500
man,
you know,

3925
02:40:56,501 --> 02:40:57,730
he doesn't really care.
He's just like,

3926
02:40:57,910 --> 02:40:58,360
man,
I just,

3927
02:40:58,440 --> 02:40:59,880
I left it all out there for you guys.
Like,

3928
02:40:59,881 --> 02:41:00,560
what do you want me to do?
Oh,

3929
02:41:00,570 --> 02:41:01,020
you knoW,
I'm not,

3930
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:02,260
I'm not a judge.
I'm a fighter.

3931
02:41:02,261 --> 02:41:07,261
I went in there and do this dude who 
Johnny Hendricks is throw some serious 

3932
02:41:07,261 --> 02:41:07,600
bricks is hitting me in the freaking 
face.

3933
02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:08,470
Of course,
you know,

3934
02:41:08,471 --> 02:41:09,400
but he,
he did,

3935
02:41:09,401 --> 02:41:11,560
he did fight through and he did.
He did finish the fight.

3936
02:41:11,561 --> 02:41:12,370
He didn't,
he didn't give up.

3937
02:41:12,371 --> 02:41:12,930
I didn't need it.

3938
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:14,130
Is that bob?
You man,

3939
02:41:14,131 --> 02:41:19,131
there's a lot of insensitivity in how 
people view fights and fighters after 

3940
02:41:19,131 --> 02:41:20,100
fights happen.
I mean,

3941
02:41:20,101 --> 02:41:21,910
I've seen guys come.
I,

3942
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:25,140
I,
I've seen guys come up to people and say

3943
02:41:25,141 --> 02:41:26,310
rude shit to them.
Like,

3944
02:41:26,311 --> 02:41:27,840
what happened man?
Why'd you get knocked out?

3945
02:41:27,990 --> 02:41:32,940
like I've seen guys say that and it's 
just like rashad evans was talking about

3946
02:41:32,941 --> 02:41:37,941
some dude who came up to him at an 
autograph signing and try to get him to 

3947
02:41:37,941 --> 02:41:38,520
autograph a picture of him.
You know,

3948
02:41:38,521 --> 02:41:40,680
that famous picture of him after machida
knocked him out.

3949
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:46,400
He got stuck in his face like smile and 
laugh and they make you autograph this 

3950
02:41:46,400 --> 02:41:50,330
and you know,
rashad crumpled it up and tell him to 

3951
02:41:50,330 --> 02:41:52,411
get the fuck out of here.
Like rudeness and not respecting the 

3952
02:41:52,411 --> 02:41:57,051
fact that this guy,
they think that it's because he gets 

3953
02:41:57,051 --> 02:41:59,031
paid for it.
He should be able to deal with your 

3954
02:41:59,031 --> 02:41:59,031
douche.
Baggery a man,

3955
02:41:59,031 --> 02:42:00,330
he's a public guy.
Isn't a public guy.

3956
02:42:01,160 --> 02:42:02,390
Classless attitude,
man.

3957
02:42:02,420 --> 02:42:04,010
That this is horrible.

3958
02:42:04,190 --> 02:42:09,190
Well,
sports fans are used to talking shit 

3959
02:42:09,190 --> 02:42:11,891
about athletes.
They've always done it with baseball 

3960
02:42:11,891 --> 02:42:14,711
players.
They've always done it with football 

3961
02:42:14,711 --> 02:42:14,711
players.
That's a big part of a basketball games.

3962
02:42:14,711 --> 02:42:19,331
People behind this,
the basket talking shit to the player 

3963
02:42:19,331 --> 02:42:20,660
while he's shooting a three pointer,
you know,

3964
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:22,340
talking shit wise on the free throw 
line,

3965
02:42:22,490 --> 02:42:25,910
given them those fucking things like 
blocking them in front of his face.

3966
02:42:26,050 --> 02:42:26,400
I think that's.

3967
02:42:26,920 --> 02:42:29,280
It is kind of funny,
but there's a difference.

3968
02:42:32,550 --> 02:42:37,550
They need to understand and appreciate 
the difference between the loss in that 

3969
02:42:37,550 --> 02:42:42,411
sport.
That's a shitty feeling to lose a 

3970
02:42:42,411 --> 02:42:44,571
basketball game and I lost an mma fight 
which is a life changing proposition now

3971
02:42:44,791 --> 02:42:49,791
you're in a completely different 
categories as far as your expectations 

3972
02:42:49,791 --> 02:42:50,940
for your future.
You have to rebuild.

3973
02:42:50,941 --> 02:42:51,120
you have to.

3974
02:42:51,290 --> 02:42:56,290
I really,
really think like the other day when I 

3975
02:42:56,290 --> 02:42:58,860
actually was in the float lab and 
actually by the way I got some shirts 

3976
02:42:58,860 --> 02:42:59,350
for in the car.
Did you like that?

3977
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:04,440
That was amazing.
You're talking about this journey that 

3978
02:43:04,440 --> 02:43:07,351
people deal with,
like people use a lot of meditation and 

3979
02:43:07,351 --> 02:43:09,400
I thought that float lab just like I 
just re redid all my finances.

3980
02:43:09,401 --> 02:43:11,920
I just redid my whole life.
Then I just took.

3981
02:43:11,950 --> 02:43:13,740
I just went on this freaking trip where 
I was just.

3982
02:43:14,020 --> 02:43:17,200
I felt like something was pulling me out
of things and I was like,

3983
02:43:17,230 --> 02:43:18,710
I was just dealing with so much out of 
there,

3984
02:43:18,711 --> 02:43:23,711
you know,
like mentally and are distinct that 

3985
02:43:23,711 --> 02:43:23,711
some,
some people you know,

3986
02:43:23,711 --> 02:43:27,121
like when you get setbacks like that,
some people dig deep and come through 

3987
02:43:27,121 --> 02:43:27,121
some,
some,

3988
02:43:27,121 --> 02:43:29,490
some groundbreaking news like in their,
in their mind where they'll,

3989
02:43:29,530 --> 02:43:30,250
they'll,
they'll change,

3990
02:43:30,251 --> 02:43:31,810
but then some people just stick to that 
pattern,

3991
02:43:31,811 --> 02:43:32,830
ended up falling off,
you know?

3992
02:43:33,230 --> 02:43:38,230
Yeah.
Well there's the reality of self 

3993
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:41,261
examination is that you don't always 
like what you see and you can either 

3994
02:43:41,261 --> 02:43:44,471
change it or you could just ignore it 
because it's too much work and you get 

3995
02:43:44,471 --> 02:43:46,400
tired or you get into that sort of 
deflecting mindset with fetus,

3996
02:43:46,970 --> 02:43:48,470
the fetus,
elitist attitude.

3997
02:43:48,710 --> 02:43:51,980
And a lot of alcoholics get that.
They just keep getting back on the wagon

3998
02:43:51,981 --> 02:43:54,230
or they keep getting back drank and they
can't help it.

3999
02:43:54,420 --> 02:43:55,760
That,
that happens all the time.

4000
02:43:55,840 --> 02:43:57,350
They just,
they can't,

4001
02:43:57,351 --> 02:43:58,410
they're not strong enough to pull,

4002
02:43:58,500 --> 02:44:00,870
pull through and it's too much work.
It's hard,

4003
02:44:00,930 --> 02:44:02,610
you know.
And the thing is,

4004
02:44:02,670 --> 02:44:05,370
it's 80 percent mental and 20 percent 
physical.

4005
02:44:05,371 --> 02:44:09,480
I really think that you have to have 
your mindset to the top peak if you're,

4006
02:44:09,481 --> 02:44:10,980
if you're going to compete and do stuff 
like that,

4007
02:44:10,981 --> 02:44:12,570
because if you're going in there with 
like a,

4008
02:44:12,930 --> 02:44:13,500
uh,
you know,

4009
02:44:13,501 --> 02:44:15,720
maybe something going on right at home 
or you know,

4010
02:44:15,810 --> 02:44:17,550
just anything,
maybe the family members die,

4011
02:44:17,560 --> 02:44:19,920
maybe just something ain't going right 
and you go into a fight,

4012
02:44:19,921 --> 02:44:20,300
you know,
that,

4013
02:44:20,301 --> 02:44:22,230
that,
that wears and tears on you mentally.

4014
02:44:22,231 --> 02:44:23,190
And it's mentally taxing.

4015
02:44:23,470 --> 02:44:28,470
Been the toughest fight for you to go 
into because you've gotten into fights 

4016
02:44:28,470 --> 02:44:28,470
with like legal issues hanging over your
head.

4017
02:44:28,470 --> 02:44:30,380
You've gotten into fights with a lot of 
bullshit going on with that.

4018
02:44:30,710 --> 02:44:33,480
That'd probably be the other part of it.
In what the eaves edwards fight,

4019
02:44:33,870 --> 02:44:35,580
which is where I got clipped.
And I was like,

4020
02:44:35,581 --> 02:44:36,600
I told you before,
I was like,

4021
02:44:36,630 --> 02:44:37,320
man,
I feel like a,

4022
02:44:37,890 --> 02:44:40,130
like a young,
like young specimen and,

4023
02:44:40,131 --> 02:44:41,760
you know,
I can take anything,

4024
02:44:41,761 --> 02:44:42,990
whatever.
And uh,

4025
02:44:42,991 --> 02:44:47,991
you know,
in the gym I was actually working on my 

4026
02:44:47,991 --> 02:44:47,991
athleticism.
I was feeling a lot more better,

4027
02:44:47,991 --> 02:44:52,161
I was a lot lighter on my feet and then 
when I went to that fight all stressed 

4028
02:44:52,161 --> 02:44:52,161
out,
I felt like the old me,

4029
02:44:52,161 --> 02:44:52,920
I was just all drugged up.
I was tight,

4030
02:44:52,921 --> 02:44:55,500
I was just going for it.
And there was just really no excuses.

4031
02:44:55,501 --> 02:44:57,000
That's my style of fighting is a,
is uh,

4032
02:44:57,001 --> 02:44:58,950
I'm willing to risk it to get,
uh,

4033
02:44:58,951 --> 02:45:00,510
you know,
I want to make bank bro,

4034
02:45:00,600 --> 02:45:01,890
you know,
and uh,

4035
02:45:02,250 --> 02:45:04,260
and I was going into that fight,
but it's not a clear head.

4036
02:45:04,261 --> 02:45:07,200
I didn't have my head on my shoulders 
and I was just gunning for it,

4037
02:45:07,260 --> 02:45:08,370
you know,
I needed the money.

4038
02:45:08,371 --> 02:45:10,650
Like I just felt like I just got robbed 
of so much.

4039
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:13,050
I got robbed in my freedom.
I got robbed them,

4040
02:45:13,051 --> 02:45:15,720
like my,
my kids putting food on the table for my

4041
02:45:15,721 --> 02:45:16,590
kids.
I was like,

4042
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:17,220
I was like,
man,

4043
02:45:17,221 --> 02:45:18,350
this isn't right.
You know,

4044
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:23,800
you,
you had some sort of illegal situation 

4045
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:23,800
where somebody accused of assault and

4046
02:45:23,800 --> 02:45:27,670
it was just someone accused me of 
basically just assaulting them and 

4047
02:45:27,670 --> 02:45:27,670
beating them like real bad,
I guess.

4048
02:45:27,670 --> 02:45:28,730
Like the person had like stopped 
breathing,

4049
02:45:29,290 --> 02:45:29,870
but the,

4050
02:45:30,230 --> 02:45:32,790
are they missing identity or a mistaken 
identity case?

4051
02:45:32,930 --> 02:45:37,930
No,
it was just a classic fact that I had 

4052
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:37,930
through an after party at like a smaller
bar.

4053
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:40,730
And to be honest,
I didn't even see a fight break out in a

4054
02:45:40,731 --> 02:45:43,640
fight had broken out and it carried on 
outside.

4055
02:45:44,030 --> 02:45:45,560
And uh,
there was,

4056
02:45:45,561 --> 02:45:50,561
uh,
there was a miscommunication was with 

4057
02:45:50,561 --> 02:45:53,081
people I guess,
like the bar owner was trying to kick 

4058
02:45:53,081 --> 02:45:54,020
this drunk guy out who from what I know 
he was at the bar.

4059
02:45:54,050 --> 02:45:55,340
He got kicked away from the bar and he's
like,

4060
02:45:55,341 --> 02:45:57,500
give me my credit card.
And he's just being disrespectful,

4061
02:45:57,530 --> 02:45:58,970
groping on women,
you know,

4062
02:45:58,971 --> 02:46:03,971
just being obnoxious,
drunk guy needed to go home and just 

4063
02:46:03,971 --> 02:46:04,440
take a chill pill.
Will keep in mind this guys like in the,

4064
02:46:04,450 --> 02:46:05,460
in the army,
you know,

4065
02:46:05,520 --> 02:46:06,200
he,
he's,

4066
02:46:06,410 --> 02:46:11,410
he's like a,
somebody you think that you would look 

4067
02:46:11,410 --> 02:46:11,410
up to or had some of respect and uh,
he just gets,

4068
02:46:11,420 --> 02:46:11,960
gets drunk.

4069
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:16,960
Basically.
The bartender kicks him out and then he 

4070
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:16,960
ends up like kicking the owner and the 
nuts for trying to get them out,

4071
02:46:16,960 --> 02:46:21,780
punch some dude actually.
And the dude had hit him back and like 

4072
02:46:21,780 --> 02:46:22,890
self defense than he had kicked the 
owner and the knots gets,

4073
02:46:22,940 --> 02:46:24,710
gets thrown out.
So they're like,

4074
02:46:24,711 --> 02:46:26,030
hey man,
this is like a private party.

4075
02:46:26,031 --> 02:46:26,960
You got,
you got to leave.

4076
02:46:26,961 --> 02:46:31,961
He starts,
he starts getting into it with another 

4077
02:46:31,961 --> 02:46:32,760
guy and then that's when it happened to 
be my after party from,

4078
02:46:32,770 --> 02:46:36,200
from a fight that I had and that's where
my name had got got brought up.

4079
02:46:36,201 --> 02:46:41,201
And I was actually uh,
I actually called down to the police 

4080
02:46:41,201 --> 02:46:41,201
station the next day was like,
hey,

4081
02:46:41,201 --> 02:46:42,530
I heard you guys were looking for me,
like,

4082
02:46:42,531 --> 02:46:44,000
what's going on?
You know?

4083
02:46:44,001 --> 02:46:44,680
And uh,
my,

4084
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:49,760
my management team was there.
He actually seen the fight and he knew 

4085
02:46:49,760 --> 02:46:50,300
he knew a lot about what was going on.

4086
02:46:50,300 --> 02:46:55,300
So we were just like being proactive.
So you didn't have anything to do with 

4087
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:55,300
it at all?
No,

4088
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:56,010
nothing at all.
I didn't even see a fight even break out

4089
02:46:56,040 --> 02:46:59,150
or the fact that the dude got knocked 
the fuck out and he thought you did it.

4090
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:00,740
He got,
I guess he got beat bad.

4091
02:47:00,741 --> 02:47:03,200
And like then people were like 
mentioning my name.

4092
02:47:03,201 --> 02:47:07,760
It was my party and the guy who actually
did it turned himself in to the police.

4093
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:08,930
Oh,
what a trip.

4094
02:47:08,970 --> 02:47:13,970
So I ended up getting in trouble like a,
almost a year later for something I 

4095
02:47:13,970 --> 02:47:18,521
completely didn't do and I was actually 
in des moines and was calling down to 

4096
02:47:18,521 --> 02:47:18,860
see if I needed to be questioned.
They're like,

4097
02:47:18,861 --> 02:47:21,140
oh no,
there's nothing to be questioned here.

4098
02:47:21,170 --> 02:47:26,170
So it was just something that you were 
on the hook for for awhile that you had 

4099
02:47:26,170 --> 02:47:26,170
nothing to do with.

4100
02:47:26,170 --> 02:47:28,580
Nothing to do with cost you a shit load 
of money in legal fees and just a lot of

4101
02:47:28,790 --> 02:47:31,020
mental stuff.
And now that I look back at it,

4102
02:47:31,370 --> 02:47:33,710
it's crazy.
I'm a lot stronger of a person from it,

4103
02:47:33,711 --> 02:47:34,120
you know,
I,

4104
02:47:34,410 --> 02:47:36,260
I really watch who I'm hanging out with.
No,

4105
02:47:36,280 --> 02:47:37,460
I don't go out,
you know,

4106
02:47:37,470 --> 02:47:38,360
I mean,
I have kids,

4107
02:47:38,361 --> 02:47:40,340
you know,
there's a time to have a serious fucking

4108
02:47:40,341 --> 02:47:41,430
career now too,
man.

4109
02:47:41,450 --> 02:47:42,650
I mean,
they're highly ranked.

4110
02:47:42,651 --> 02:47:47,651
That honey jason knockout was a big wake
up call for a lot of people in 145 

4111
02:47:47,651 --> 02:47:47,651
pounds.
Thanks man.

4112
02:47:47,651 --> 02:47:49,000
I've had two fights there now.
Yeah,

4113
02:47:49,001 --> 02:47:51,370
I'm,
I'm a discredit to my coaches,

4114
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:51,790
man.
My,

4115
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:53,000
my team,
my family.

4116
02:47:53,810 --> 02:47:57,920
Thanks for ufc and dana wife who really 
believe in believe in me.

4117
02:47:57,921 --> 02:47:58,670
And I was just like,
man,

4118
02:47:58,671 --> 02:48:00,130
I had nothing to do with this dude,
you know,

4119
02:48:00,140 --> 02:48:01,490
like I,
and I just got,

4120
02:48:01,491 --> 02:48:03,200
I just got robbed the so much,
but that didn't,

4121
02:48:03,230 --> 02:48:08,230
that didn't define me as a person to 
person that I was becoming in the gym 

4122
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:08,230
and uh,
you know,

4123
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:08,710
it's just going to show now.

4124
02:48:08,750 --> 02:48:10,840
Now's the right time.
I think everything's really connected in

4125
02:48:10,841 --> 02:48:12,950
my career,
thanks to my coaches and,

4126
02:48:12,951 --> 02:48:14,840
and everybody's so support me,
I think.

4127
02:48:14,990 --> 02:48:16,850
I think right now I'm really starting to
grow because,

4128
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:17,620
you know,
when,

4129
02:48:17,650 --> 02:48:19,070
when I first seen you,
I was,

4130
02:48:19,130 --> 02:48:24,130
I was just turned 21 in the ufc and I 
really kinda grew up inside the ufc and 

4131
02:48:24,130 --> 02:48:27,880
fought guys that I probably shouldn't 
have been fighting that or it didn't 

4132
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:27,880
really have a chance and I'd go out and 
I'd win,

4133
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:28,760
you know,
so I had a young career,

4134
02:48:28,761 --> 02:48:30,140
you know,
when I was 22 years old,

4135
02:48:30,141 --> 02:48:31,940
I had like $100,000
in my bank account.

4136
02:48:32,180 --> 02:48:34,090
I didn't even know what to do with it.
I was just enjoying myself.

4137
02:48:34,170 --> 02:48:35,390
You did the smart thing,
man,

4138
02:48:35,391 --> 02:48:38,450
you realize that you have potential and 
you went down to a serious jim,

4139
02:48:38,490 --> 02:48:43,490
you know,
alliance san diego without a doubt is 

4140
02:48:43,490 --> 02:48:43,730
one of the best gyms in the country's 
excellent move.

4141
02:48:43,780 --> 02:48:48,780
The,
the perfect thing for you to do and 

4142
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:48,780
look,
it's,

4143
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:48,780
it's a beautiful thing to see,
right?

4144
02:48:48,780 --> 02:48:49,420
Yeah.
Work and reaping the reward.

4145
02:48:49,450 --> 02:48:51,080
Go feral man.
He's the man dude.

4146
02:48:51,110 --> 02:48:53,630
He's like a.
He's almost like a sports psychologist.

4147
02:48:53,631 --> 02:48:55,850
He just really knows how to click with 
me and knows what to say.

4148
02:48:55,851 --> 02:49:00,851
How to work with me and I was looking 
for that for like the longest time when 

4149
02:49:00,851 --> 02:49:04,031
I was traveling,
I'd went to Florida with hermes and it 

4150
02:49:04,031 --> 02:49:06,811
had some run ins with some bad 
management and like I was getting 

4151
02:49:06,811 --> 02:49:09,491
screwed over there,
so just didn't really have the right 

4152
02:49:09,491 --> 02:49:11,681
people around me at the time.
And I was just searching for somebody 

4153
02:49:11,681 --> 02:49:11,681
just to grab a hold of me in this mold 
me into something,

4154
02:49:11,681 --> 02:49:12,420
you know,
I knew I had all the,

4155
02:49:12,470 --> 02:49:15,030
all the skills and talent.
I just needed that type of coach.

4156
02:49:15,031 --> 02:49:17,130
And I think I've really found that with 
coach eric del faro,

4157
02:49:17,131 --> 02:49:17,670
man,
that guy,

4158
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,680
he's a,
he's creating a monster and I love where

4159
02:49:19,681 --> 02:49:20,060
he's going.

4160
02:49:20,130 --> 02:49:21,760
What's next for you now?
Who he fight next?

4161
02:49:22,060 --> 02:49:25,580
Because I know that there was going to 
be a quick turnaround because your fight

4162
02:49:25,590 --> 02:49:25,980
was quick.

4163
02:49:26,090 --> 02:49:27,020
Yeah,
fight was quick.

4164
02:49:27,021 --> 02:49:29,400
I'm healthy as a personal goal of mine 
to uh,

4165
02:49:29,420 --> 02:49:31,280
to get in there and get after it,
get a huge win.

4166
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:33,710
And uh,
I'd set some goals for myself,

4167
02:49:33,711 --> 02:49:34,680
you know,
I see them everyday.

4168
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:37,280
They're hung up on my door and this is 
one of my goals.

4169
02:49:37,370 --> 02:49:42,120
I'm going back close to my hometown,
which is a chicago January 25th lane.

4170
02:49:42,140 --> 02:49:45,290
Josh thompson,
benson henderson is on that card and uh,

4171
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:50,320
my,
my hometown's is right next door and 

4172
02:49:50,320 --> 02:49:50,320
this is a real huge fight for me.
I'm fine.

4173
02:49:50,320 --> 02:49:50,320
Oh,
I'm finding a darren.

4174
02:49:50,320 --> 02:49:51,500
Darren elkins.
That's good.

4175
02:49:51,501 --> 02:49:52,120
Fight.
Yeah.

4176
02:49:52,121 --> 02:49:52,510
Yeah.
He's,

4177
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:53,810
he's,
he's a tough wrestler.

4178
02:49:53,811 --> 02:49:58,811
he's from the midwest guy and uh,
I really just think that I have all the 

4179
02:49:58,811 --> 02:49:59,050
skills to beat him.
I'm just gonna.

4180
02:49:59,070 --> 02:50:00,950
Keep this ball steamrolling.
Nice.

4181
02:50:01,350 --> 02:50:03,470
Think is going to try to take you down.
Yeah,

4182
02:50:03,471 --> 02:50:06,740
I think so.
I think elkins is tough as fuck dude.

4183
02:50:06,741 --> 02:50:08,070
He banks with everybody.
He does.

4184
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:09,530
He does,
but he also,

4185
02:50:09,531 --> 02:50:11,360
he's very smart.
He utilizes his wrestling.

4186
02:50:11,780 --> 02:50:12,950
He's a,
he's got good,

4187
02:50:13,010 --> 02:50:14,700
good ground and pound.
He's lengthy.

4188
02:50:14,720 --> 02:50:17,390
Knows how to use his range,
but I see a few holes in his game.

4189
02:50:17,391 --> 02:50:18,410
Man.
It's gonna be a great fight.

4190
02:50:18,411 --> 02:50:19,850
It's going to be a fun fight and I think
he'll,

4191
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:21,840
he'll bring out a lot of viciousness in 
me by,

4192
02:50:21,920 --> 02:50:22,730
by his attacks.

4193
02:50:23,230 --> 02:50:28,230
Yeah,
I Think that's going to be an awesome 

4194
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:28,230
fucking fight and that card is sick.
I love that.

4195
02:50:28,230 --> 02:50:28,540
Benson henderson,
josh thompson fight.

4196
02:50:28,541 --> 02:50:31,390
I like the fact that josh thompson,
even though he's in life for a title,

4197
02:50:31,530 --> 02:50:32,920
you know the champ gets her and he's 
like,

4198
02:50:33,010 --> 02:50:33,960
who else?
I like that.

4199
02:50:33,990 --> 02:50:35,190
I liked that about fighters,
man.

4200
02:50:35,191 --> 02:50:40,191
I don't,
I don't believe in waiting around 

4201
02:50:40,191 --> 02:50:40,191
mendez.
Go ahead and just prove kenny florian.

4202
02:50:40,191 --> 02:50:43,640
I actually,
somebody I actually looked up to a long 

4203
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:43,640
time ago,
he was just beating these guys.

4204
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:43,640
They're like,
man,

4205
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:43,640
Florida,
what's next?

4206
02:50:43,640 --> 02:50:44,280
TItle shot?
And he's like,

4207
02:50:44,281 --> 02:50:45,030
no man,
you know,

4208
02:50:45,031 --> 02:50:46,270
I just like,
I just tell you what he's like,

4209
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:47,550
just bring,
bring me whoever.

4210
02:50:47,551 --> 02:50:47,950
He's like,
oh,

4211
02:50:47,951 --> 02:50:52,951
I'll beat anybody from top to bottom 
just to prove that I deserve this title 

4212
02:50:52,951 --> 02:50:52,951
shot.
And he's like,

4213
02:50:52,951 --> 02:50:53,520
I just want everybody to know that.
And I was just like,

4214
02:50:53,521 --> 02:50:54,380
what a piece,
you know?

4215
02:50:54,480 --> 02:50:55,320
Yeah,
I love.

4216
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:58,860
I love the fact that thompson is coming 
into his own,

4217
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:03,920
as you know,
after a long history of being in the 

4218
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:03,920
fight game,
but he's as good as it's ever been.

4219
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:08,781
That fight against nate diaz was 
fantastic and his fights in strikeforce 

4220
02:51:08,781 --> 02:51:11,770
with gilbert were fantastic before then.
He's really improved as

4221
02:51:12,360 --> 02:51:13,690
he's always been an athlete,
you know,

4222
02:51:14,170 --> 02:51:16,710
even back when they cut the ufc,
he was fighting eaves,

4223
02:51:16,711 --> 02:51:18,760
you know,
he ended up getting a vicious kick,

4224
02:51:18,761 --> 02:51:20,260
you know,
he's throwing to backfill and is getting

4225
02:51:20,261 --> 02:51:21,730
caught,
but he's had a long,

4226
02:51:21,731 --> 02:51:26,731
good,
successful career and he's very 

4227
02:51:26,731 --> 02:51:26,731
athletic,
very skilled and he's like really coming

4228
02:51:26,731 --> 02:51:27,400
into his prime right now.

4229
02:51:27,480 --> 02:51:28,960
Yeah,
he's been around for a long time,

4230
02:51:28,961 --> 02:51:30,440
man.
He's like true,

4231
02:51:31,160 --> 02:51:33,090
true vet,
but a real smart,

4232
02:51:33,091 --> 02:51:34,410
skilled,
very skilled,

4233
02:51:34,411 --> 02:51:36,030
smart.
He does a lot of sneaky shit.

4234
02:51:36,210 --> 02:51:41,210
Those trickery,
trickery of those trips that he hit 

4235
02:51:41,210 --> 02:51:41,210
gilbert with,
I loved those.

4236
02:51:41,210 --> 02:51:42,740
He grabbed your neck and trips you and 
shit.

4237
02:51:42,750 --> 02:51:43,890
He does a lot of weird shit

4238
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:44,820
and then he'll start.
He'll,

4239
02:51:44,880 --> 02:51:45,630
he'll,
he'll do.

4240
02:51:46,050 --> 02:51:51,050
He'll do like a take down and right away
he'll pop up just to strike and throw 

4241
02:51:51,050 --> 02:51:52,660
elbows at you.
If he's really interesting to watch.

4242
02:51:52,661 --> 02:51:53,030
He's,
he's,

4243
02:51:53,060 --> 02:51:54,180
he's a fun guy to watch.
He's real.

4244
02:51:54,181 --> 02:51:55,620
He's real active at 55.

4245
02:51:56,040 --> 02:51:58,500
Yeah.
He's such a good fucking way.

4246
02:51:58,501 --> 02:52:01,080
Class men 55 or so,
some crazy.

4247
02:52:01,440 --> 02:52:04,800
There's so many good fucking talent 
filled weight classes now.

4248
02:52:05,490 --> 02:52:06,340
Five stack,

4249
02:52:06,370 --> 02:52:08,260
30th five stacked.
I was impressed.

4250
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:10,060
You know,
it's like a josh thompson,

4251
02:52:10,630 --> 02:52:12,800
rashad evans,
all these guys.

4252
02:52:12,801 --> 02:52:14,590
They're like wood that he went right 
through jail.

4253
02:52:14,591 --> 02:52:15,820
Man.
That was a different.

4254
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:17,350
It was a different.
That was a different.

4255
02:52:17,351 --> 02:52:18,820
Rashad,
I think he's on a different level.

4256
02:52:18,821 --> 02:52:20,200
We got to wrap this up.
Unfortunately,

4257
02:52:20,201 --> 02:52:22,390
we're almost out of time at three hours 
were run out of gas.

4258
02:52:23,110 --> 02:52:26,780
We turn into a pumpkin.
Ustream can't handle recording.

4259
02:52:26,781 --> 02:52:28,720
It's one three hours long for whatever 
reason.

4260
02:52:28,900 --> 02:52:32,550
My point is a real quick robbie lawler,
another one.

4261
02:52:33,340 --> 02:52:35,740
All of a sudden he's.
He looks vicious,

4262
02:52:35,741 --> 02:52:37,360
man.
He's throwing kicks now.

4263
02:52:37,470 --> 02:52:38,550
Like,
holy shit.

4264
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:41,730
He's just sticking it out.
They just keep sticking out.

4265
02:52:41,740 --> 02:52:46,740
Keep grinding.
It takes years to get your striking 

4266
02:52:46,740 --> 02:52:49,171
together.
It takes years and a lot of fighters 

4267
02:52:49,171 --> 02:52:50,941
quit before they're striking gets down,
so just focus and maturity and really 

4268
02:52:50,941 --> 02:52:52,300
putting in the side of the octagon.

4269
02:52:52,300 --> 02:52:54,840
Him and even diaz diaz was like,
what?

4270
02:52:54,910 --> 02:52:58,580
18,
when he found lawler and rory macdonald,

4271
02:52:58,600 --> 02:53:03,270
end of the fight on top elbowing robbie,
so props to Roy Mcdonald to shit.

4272
02:53:03,850 --> 02:53:05,050
It was a great fight.
Alright,

4273
02:53:05,450 --> 02:53:06,760
Jeremy Stevens.
We got to do this again.

4274
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:07,810
