1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:04,280
The joe rogan experience fucking
16 hours to remote audio book.

2
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:04,730
I was like,

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:05,563
oh my God,

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,520
I cannot read out loud to save my life.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,870
16 hours.

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,970
How many hours is the actual audio book?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,833
Three.

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,733
Whoa,

9
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,030
that's crazy.

10
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,050
I am the worst out loud reader and for
like the first two chapters get mad if

11
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:18,884
you fuck it up.

12
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:19,783
Yeah.

13
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:21,500
The guy who asked me like are the first,

14
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,611
first chapter.

15
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:22,851
He's like,

16
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,061
hey man,

17
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:23,990
do you need glasses?

18
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,221
I was like,

19
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:25,421
no,

20
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:25,700
I just,

21
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,331
I'm not that good at it.

22
00:00:26,331 --> 00:00:26,691
And I was like,

23
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,411
I'll do it drunk.

24
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,610
Everyone wants to hear me do a drunk,

25
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,960
you can't fucking read drunk.

26
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,670
So then I described that day,

27
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,040
that day is all you supposed
to had to go back and Redo it.

28
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,540
And then,

29
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,220
and then I was also like,

30
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,200
like I'd read a passage and
then I go on and be like,

31
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,150
I'm like,

32
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,090
and then I'd expound on what I
just read and kind of was like an,

33
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,980
I was like a podcast and that was fucking
horrible cause that took like forever.

34
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,030
And so that finally the guys like,

35
00:00:50,031 --> 00:00:50,864
just fucking read it.

36
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,790
So I'll just read it towards the end,

37
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,780
but it gets better.

38
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,080
I think you'd be better if you
just read it and if you fucked up,

39
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:59,900
just comment on the fact that you fucked
that word up and just keep going on

40
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:01,220
like that way people would,

41
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,083
they would get,

42
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,560
they'd get the book,

43
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:04,281
the whole book,

44
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,790
but they'd also get like
experience of you reading the book.

45
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,580
Like you separating yourself
from the book while you're at it.

46
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,271
Oh yeah.

47
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,290
I mean they,

48
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,730
I don't know what it's going
to sound like but cause I,

49
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,890
I did acknowledge it.

50
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:16,431
I did one,

51
00:01:16,431 --> 00:01:21,431
I did fuck up cause I'm a comic so I would
work the piece as I was like if I was

52
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:22,274
on stage.

53
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,950
And did they keep that in
or do they edit that stuff?

54
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,520
They kept s I think they kept some of
it in but they couldn't have kept all of

55
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:28,880
it in.

56
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,870
That's so weird though that they decide
what gets left in and what comes out.

57
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,100
This whole to this whole book writing
process has been vulnerable as fucked

58
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:36,620
because you,

59
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,830
you really let go of it because
it's an entirely different industry.

60
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,171
Yeah.

61
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:40,591
I didn't,

62
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:41,424
I passed,

63
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,600
I had a book deal.

64
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,190
I was writing the book and they were still
giving these old wacky fucking notes.

65
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,550
Just advice on like how I
should talk about things,

66
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:52,680
what I should describe and how I was like,

67
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,130
we're not,

68
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,270
this is not happening.

69
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,630
You know,

70
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,400
you're not involved in
the creative process.

71
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,230
I gave them their money back.

72
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,531
I was like,

73
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,370
this is crazy.

74
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Like they wanted me to essentially write
my act down on paper and sell it as a

75
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:05,521
book and they're like,

76
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,860
well George Carlin did it
and Jerry Seinfeld did it.

77
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,190
I was like,

78
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,640
ah,

79
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,473
that's nice.

80
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,461
I don't give a fuck.

81
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,294
I'm not doing that.

82
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,370
I write different than I do stand up.

83
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,420
It's two different things.

84
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,940
Like you can write when you're writing,

85
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
like just writing.

86
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,920
There's a way that you can express
yourself that's unavailable if you're

87
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,754
talking,

88
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,910
you know,

89
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,150
it's,

90
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:25,730
it's why you,

91
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,510
the dragon dictate didn't work for me
cause you'd talk it into this dragon

92
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,010
dictate and it would put
it right into the computer,

93
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,203
like print it.

94
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,130
But it didn't work for me because it
sounded spoken like it sounded like and,

95
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,400
and,

96
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,670
and a couple like,

97
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,400
and one of the hard things for me was I,

98
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,380
I did that same thing
where they wanted to,

99
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:44,540
all the stories I had told
on stage or on podcasts,

100
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,201
I was like,

101
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:45,650
I can't,

102
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,131
I can't do that.

103
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,230
I can't just fill it up with that.

104
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,621
Yeah.

105
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:49,900
They want the stuff that they
think they're going to sell.

106
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:50,710
It's not a,

107
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,850
an artistic thing.

108
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:52,181
It's like,

109
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,170
guess what dummy?

110
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,270
The same person that
told those funny stories.

111
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,130
I can tell you other funny stories,

112
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,990
like we're not running
out of funny stories here.

113
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,880
It's really fascinating.

114
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,050
And,

115
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,990
and their stories,

116
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:02,860
I had to put in the book,

117
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,240
I had to put the machine in.

118
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,220
I can't not write that in there.

119
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:06,881
And there's a lot of,

120
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,320
there's like the Will Smith Story.

121
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,280
I had to put it in,

122
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,580
but then I wanted to
do this several polls.

123
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,440
One I wanted to do one where I met
Ralph Sampson and when I was a kid I was

124
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,533
Ralph Sampson.

125
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,600
Um,

126
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,010
he was a basketball player and I was,

127
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,970
I went to school at,

128
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,810
I went to,

129
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,240
I was like in eighth grade I decided I
really wanted to be a basketball player.

130
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:27,241
And so I went to Villanova basketball
camp and Ralph Sampson came to speak.

131
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:30,910
And like the first night
I got a concussion and the
two best basketball players

132
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,350
got pulled out for drinking.

133
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,620
So the next day I had to sit out with the
two best possible players and everyone

134
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,610
thought we drank together.

135
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,710
So now all of a sudden I'm 15,

136
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,950
14 and everyone thinks I'm cool because
I'm parting with the 18 year olds.

137
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,031
So Ralph Sampson,

138
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,360
coms,

139
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,410
I thought this define me.

140
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,300
Ralph Sampson comes up to give a speech.

141
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:46,571
He's like,

142
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,310
I'm here to talk to you
about two things there.

143
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,580
5,000 kids on the gym floor.

144
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,061
He said,

145
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,300
we were talking about basketball and
we're talking about discipline first let's

146
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,140
talk about discipline.

147
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:56,531
Who in here?

148
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:57,130
Parties.

149
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,040
And I was under the impression we
were all gonna put our hands up,

150
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,840
but I was the only fucking person,

151
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,770
I just want to shrink.

152
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,970
And he was like,

153
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,140
Oh one person,

154
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,101
5,000 kids,

155
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:07,240
no one raise her fucking hand.

156
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,841
He's like,

157
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,620
how do you party?

158
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,540
I was fucking 13 I know how to,

159
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,290
I didn't,

160
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,190
I never partied in my life.

161
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:16,210
So all I said was hardy
and he fucking lost it.

162
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,400
And 5,000 kids are slapping the gym floor.

163
00:04:18,401 --> 00:04:19,090
Like,

164
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,080
Oh shit,

165
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,520
we're going to make an example out of you.

166
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,180
Party animal.

167
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,170
He's lost the room.

168
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,370
So he brings me up front to the in front
of all the kids and he makes me stand

169
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:32,080
up and he puts a basketball behind my
legs like this and then one on my arms

170
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:32,914
like this.

171
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,851
And he's like,

172
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:34,720
we party hardy.

173
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:34,841
What?

174
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,010
We're going to party hardy today.

175
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,750
So I'm standing like this for his whole
fucking hour speech with basketball here

176
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,141
and there.

177
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:41,974
And he's like,

178
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,150
and he keeps coming back to me.

179
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,111
And by the way,

180
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,600
I'm so in my head that I'm,

181
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,480
I'm have social anxiety disorder but I'm
in front of everyone and I'm like being

182
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:52,690
made fun of being mocked that I
wasn't listening to his question.

183
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,524
Somebody is like,

184
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,360
you think you'll ever party again?

185
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,290
I just said yeah and the
fucking place went bananas.

186
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,153
They're like,

187
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,641
oh.

188
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,001
And he's like,

189
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:01,840
how do you party hardy?

190
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:02,320
I was like,

191
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,370
and I didn't know the answer.

192
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,960
I just was like with two hands,

193
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,820
fucking people are losing.

194
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,770
You think you'd do marijuana
and now I'm killing.

195
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:11,830
I'm like I'll get to in
college and these kids,

196
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,130
I left that gym and everyone
wanted to talk to me.

197
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,360
Everyone's like party animal.

198
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:19,630
What are you doing and that you're still
holding the basketball between your

199
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:21,410
legs the whole fucking time.

200
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,680
Cracking jokes while I'm cracking jokes.

201
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,000
And how long did you hold the basketball?

202
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:25,834
An hour.

203
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,530
That's a long time by my cousin ape.

204
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:28,540
I almost brought him here to there.

205
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:28,871
I should have,

206
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,710
I didn't even think about it.

207
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:32,800
My cousin aid was there at the
camp even cause he's from Philly.

208
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:33,634
I didn't know anyone.

209
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,421
My cousin,

210
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,170
he was like,

211
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,560
I didn't even,

212
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,370
I didn't know you partied.

213
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:36,551
I go,

214
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,384
I don't,

215
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:38,710
I don't,

216
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,330
I just thought we'd all
put our fucking hands off.

217
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,441
He's like,

218
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:41,621
no,

219
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:42,910
why would you put your
hands up if you don't party?

220
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:43,211
I was like,

221
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,140
I want it to be cool.

222
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,621
So yeah,

223
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:48,430
so like so now and then everyone
would come up and they'd be like,

224
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:48,911
party animal,

225
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,620
you partying harder than I'd be like,

226
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:51,454
yeah.

227
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,540
But then I became cool at that camp and
then I have friends and so I wrote that

228
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,290
story is a little longer
and I gave to them,

229
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:57,830
I go,

230
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,790
this is the best story.

231
00:05:58,791 --> 00:05:59,720
This defines me.

232
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,810
And they're like,

233
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,643
oh,

234
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,001
I'm out.

235
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:02,630
Really?

236
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,650
That's hilarious.

237
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,090
So it's all partying stories,

238
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,040
but it's like that's a hilarious story.

239
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,130
Don't thanks so nutty that this could
have possibly sent you on a path when you

240
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,544
were that young.

241
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,270
You know,

242
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:14,991
13 years old.

243
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,370
I just,

244
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:15,740
I,

245
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,570
and it's all just wanting to be accepted.

246
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,140
I remember.

247
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,300
Did you ever have one of those moments
where you'd go somewhere and you didn't

248
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,450
know anybody but you felt like
everyone fucking grew up together?

249
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:23,991
Yeah,

250
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,830
that's a weird feeling.

251
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,720
I felt like that a lot as a kid.

252
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,170
Yeah.

253
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,030
But I thought that that define
me because then I became the,

254
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,350
I became the party animal but
kind of lived up to whatever.

255
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,341
By the way,

256
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,570
I went to high school the very next year.

257
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:36,440
It didn't know anyone,

258
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,820
so I'm sure that kind of,

259
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,151
I was like,

260
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:39,470
well it worked in Villanova.

261
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,701
So yeah,

262
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,940
there's definitely different personality
that develops when kids have to move to

263
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,361
right.

264
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:48,030
If they move from one spot to another
spot and move more than once they develop

265
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:48,231
this.

266
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:51,830
Like it's this weird newcomer personality,

267
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,540
you know,

268
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,490
in every romantic kids movie,

269
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,020
the rebel that moved into town,

270
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,320
the new kid that you don't know if any
think he smoked cigarettes and fucking

271
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,950
twilight style movie or
even like karate kid.

272
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,380
Didn't he like move
into some new town dude,

273
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,083
crazy kid.

274
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,771
I was fucking,

275
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:10,820
the day karate kid came out,

276
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,080
it was my first day of tennis camp.

277
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,863
And so,

278
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,043
so I go,

279
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,120
I gotta fucking can't believe
I didn't write about this.

280
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,040
This I didn't mean no anyone.

281
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,874
I know anyone.

282
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,773
So then the,

283
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,580
these all the La Veranda camp,

284
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,230
I started meeting the cool
kids and they were like,

285
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:24,471
hey man,

286
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:25,130
what are you doing today?

287
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,521
I was like,

288
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:26,210
nothing.

289
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,790
And then if you want to go see karate
kid and I didn't know anything about it

290
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:29,180
and I was like,

291
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,551
Oh yeah,

292
00:07:29,551 --> 00:07:29,870
yeah,

293
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,703
that'd be cool.

294
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,161
So like cool,

295
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:31,970
meet us at mission bell.

296
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,230
That's where this place was.

297
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,450
My Mom's late picking me off.

298
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,710
We're late doing everything.

299
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:40,180
She drops me off to the movie late and
I go in and the movie's already started

300
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:40,251
at,

301
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,270
can't find any of the kids,

302
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:44,330
but I already bought the ticket and I
already have popcorn and a drink and I'm

303
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:44,660
like,

304
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,170
fuck.

305
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,940
So I just go down and I sit down.

306
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,570
I've never seen a movie by myself that
time and I just sit down and I keep

307
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:51,021
looking for him,

308
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,010
but I can't fucking find them.

309
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,270
But then the movie starts and it's a
great fucking movie and it's a movie about

310
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:59,950
a loner kid like myself that doesn't
know anyone and he's trying to break into

311
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,500
the new group,

312
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,140
just like I was doing a tennis camp
and I really get involved in it.

313
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,950
I get so involved with the movie that
when he does the fucking crane kick and

314
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:07,880
kicks the guy,

315
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,350
I start bawling,

316
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:10,340
fucking crying,

317
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,810
thinking I'm Danielson.

318
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,370
I'm Dan in my head,

319
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm like,

320
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,720
I feel like Daniel son,

321
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,190
the houselights come up and the fucking
kids that were had wanted me to meet,

322
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,370
we're sitting directly like two rows
in front of me and I heard you weeping,

323
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,260
heard me crying,

324
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,630
and I'm weeping.

325
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,911
Like,

326
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:26,421
wow,

327
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:27,254
bing,

328
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,510
like a fucking 10 year old cry.

329
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,380
Like if you were 10,

330
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,220
how'd that work out?

331
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,060
Uh,

332
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,930
they turn around and they saw me crying
and there were about to make fun of me.

333
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:36,764
And they're like,

334
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:37,371
oh,

335
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,390
you got us,

336
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:38,931
you got,

337
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,850
we thought you were crying
and you fucking with us.

338
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,230
He was sitting behind us the whole time.

339
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:42,990
And I was like,

340
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,460
yeah,

341
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:43,671
yeah,

342
00:08:43,671 --> 00:08:44,270
that's it.

343
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,103
That's it.

344
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,810
And I fucking walked out that movie.

345
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,250
I still to this day,

346
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,340
so you,

347
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,200
you had to fake that.

348
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,580
You weren't crying to fake that I wasn't
crying and then we all hung out in

349
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:53,671
there.

350
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:53,811
Like,

351
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:54,591
you can just do that,

352
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:55,424
make yourself cry.

353
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,141
And I was like,

354
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:56,974
yeah,

355
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,330
okay.
