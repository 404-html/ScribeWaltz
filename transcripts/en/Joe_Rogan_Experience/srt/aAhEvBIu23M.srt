1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:02,700
Are we starting now?

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,170
Well,

4
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,290
I was going to fucking tweet it.

5
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,550
Oh,

6
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,360
there we go.

7
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,400
The Joe Rogan experience
is sponsored by fleshlight.

8
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,790
They're number one sex toy for my niche.

9
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,750
If you go to Joe Rogan's website,

10
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,410
click on that link on the right side and
put the code Rogan in to save yourself.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,340
How much Joe?

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,640
15% off ride.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,090
It's the number went sex toy for a reason.

14
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:28,380
Because when you fuck it,

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,490
it feels way better than
any product you can buy.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,353
It's try.

17
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,790
I have tested every single thing out.

18
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,280
It's a of central Japanese toys,

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,310
place things made an
Africa out of cantaloupes.

20
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:41,971
I mean,

21
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:43,330
I've tested Cameroon in Africa.

22
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,940
It's produce based sex toys mostly in
this statement in the the South Africa

23
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,774
regions.

24
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,320
Uh,

25
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,240
but there's flashlights
always in the number one.

26
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:51,900
It's the best.

27
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:52,681
They really,

28
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,510
it's a genius invention.

29
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:54,871
I mean,

30
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:55,041
it's,

31
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:58,800
it doesn't get the credit that it deserves
because everybody's so embarrassed

32
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:00,580
with dirty a fucking song.

33
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,790
But it's an amazing product.

34
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:02,941
I mean,

35
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:05,280
as far as like really effective products,

36
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:05,941
oh,

37
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,211
I mean,

38
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,470
it's really does what?

39
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:08,370
As advertised.

40
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
It feels like a great vagina,

41
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,610
not just a good vagina,

42
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,870
a great vagina.

43
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,190
And if you,

44
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,730
if you like soaking in warm
water before you fuck it.

45
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,460
Oh yeah.

46
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,430
It feels like a human body expands.

47
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:20,830
No.

48
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,500
Warms the human body.

49
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:25,140
Does it make it feels like a human body.

50
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,830
I did one of those sleeps here today
where you wake up and you're just

51
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:29,760
completely like,

52
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:29,911
oh,

53
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:31,080
I don't have to do anything.

54
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,630
So I'm just going to lay here and
just kind of stretch out a little.

55
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,760
And then I saw the
flashlight on my nightstand,

56
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:35,940
like,

57
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,241
oh,

58
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,530
I'm ready to go deep with this shit.

59
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,750
It just clean.

60
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,250
It had never been used before.

61
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:42,510
It was one of these new ones.

62
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,280
And I got this lotion.

63
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,360
It was every time I come,

64
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,790
I think I'll just do it in the morning,

65
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,750
then I'll go back to bed.

66
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,090
Uh,

67
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,440
talk for some reason that
morning not fills me with energy.

68
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,130
Yeah.

69
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,940
Then I'm like that time to start
the day that p Boehner where you,

70
00:01:55,941 --> 00:02:00,030
you actually bypassed the p
and still comic or even go pee.

71
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,290
That's amazing.

72
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:01,531
That's a,

73
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,730
that's a talent right there.

74
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,290
Those nighttime boners are so important
to hotel rooms to go to bed beat off

75
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,670
right before you go to bed,

76
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,630
like in the hotel room.

77
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,710
Sometimes when you're on the road,

78
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,360
you know you have a hard time sleeping.

79
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,650
That's when those nighttime masturbation,

80
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,700
my worst times when I'm on the road,

81
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,630
flashlight will come in handy and I know
I'm gonna hold a seat for two hours.

82
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:24,360
I'd have to go to radio and I'd
like to beat off into a sock,

83
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:24,780
but I don't,

84
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:25,410
I want a hot,

85
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,570
I want to reuse that sock
just for morning radio.

86
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,830
I don't want to use a fresh
soc for it right on the word.

87
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,120
You can't bring the
flashlight with you though.

88
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,350
That's like the lineup.

89
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,830
Something about travel.

90
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:39,721
It's like,

91
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:40,411
wow man.

92
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,244
You're just,

93
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,551
you know,

94
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,670
you're admitting that you can't even go
wherever we're a couple of days without

95
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:47,790
beating off like such a blatant admission.

96
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,720
Just committing to it
so much so that you're,

97
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:53,550
you're not worried about being stopped
at the airport and search for sex toys.

98
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,200
They should have a travel flashlight.

99
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,561
Dude.

100
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:56,730
You don't even know what happened.

101
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:58,110
You Know Veronica Ricci,

102
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,930
she,

103
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,380
uh,

104
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,100
she went to

105
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
Israel,

106
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,590
uh,

107
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:01,960
uh,

108
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,960
last week I went there by herself and
they thought she was a spy and so they

109
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,030
went through it,

110
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,030
her luggage for like four days and they
shouldn't have luggage for four days.

111
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,720
And they were like asking her,

112
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,390
because I guess they
thought she was like a,

113
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,310
like a terrorist of some sort because
there's no other like girls her age,

114
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:21,761
you know,

115
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,030
that they are not Jewish is
visiting Israel right now I guess.

116
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,310
And so she got like,

117
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,640
she had to buy a whole all know she had
to buy all new clothes and then she said

118
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:33,010
it was like pretty fucking
dirty and scare you could,

119
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,900
there's people with
machine guns everywhere.

120
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,320
A lot of people played
elbows and she's like,

121
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:38,531
dude,

122
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,340
when you see the machine guns and
oboes getting played everywhere.

123
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,970
So just because she came there by herself,

124
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,470
they thought that she was a terrorist,

125
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,983
searching everybody

126
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,920
and,

127
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,820
and well she also bought her ticket like,

128
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:50,060
you know,

129
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:50,880
last minute.

130
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,130
Like she just wanted to go to,

131
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,600
let's get through these commercials.

132
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:54,530
So we could talk about this.

133
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,810
We have to send his
commercials for us down.

134
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,070
So if bring your flashlight to Israel,

135
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:58,760
be careful.

136
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,630
But other than that,

137
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,570

138
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,250

00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:11,840
And what nootropics are,

154
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:15,410
is their supplements that are designed
to enhance the way your brain functions.

155
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,620
It's a very controversial issue.

good results with them.

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,343
I like them,

The supplements,

170
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:44,151
all of them.

171
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,320
When you order 30 pills,

172
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,450
there was at 100% money back guarantee.

173
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,100
You don't have to return the product.

174
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:49,821
You just have to say,

175
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:50,654
this sucks.

176
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,580
Nobody is trying to rip you off.

177
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,750
Everything that we sell is
the highest quality possible,

178
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,250
the highest quality available,

179
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,390
and the best measures that
we know and the of the,

180
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,470
the most important thing for us is that
no one feels like they got ripped off.

181
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,160
So we make sure that there's a 100%
money back guarantee on all first orders

182
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,953
through that.

183
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,520
Yeah.

184
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,130
People tell you that.

185
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:15,560
Yeah.

186
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,393
They get their money back.

187
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:16,890
You know,

188
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,780
it's some people,

189
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:18,614
first of all,

190
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,660
I don't know how everybody's body works.

191
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:21,950
Everybody's body works different.

192
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,070
I could never claim that something that's
effective for me is effective for you.

193
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,070
There's some things that other
people are allergic to that I'm not.

194
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,250
There's a lot of weirdness
when it comes to bodies.

195
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,090
Yeah.

196
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,320
I don't know how your brain works.

197
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,510
Maybe your brain works better
than mine all the time anyway.

198
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,021
You know,

199
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:39,560
maybe some people need nootropics and
some people are like those kids that can

200
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:43,850
look out a window of an airplane and
then draw everything they saw and exact

201
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,540
proportion.

202
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:44,910
Interesting.

203
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,743
That kid,

204
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,843
that kid do that.

205
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:47,751
I don't know.

206
00:05:47,751 --> 00:05:51,550
Maybe his brain is just working like
in that function in that regard,

207
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,370
like so much higher rpms and
mind can ever achieve ever.

208
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,623
I don't know.

209
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,710
But I from me,

210
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,060
nootropics are effective.

211
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,200
They are for a,

212
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,960
a lot of my friends that take
him a mayhem believes in him.

213
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,000
He told me the first time
I ever gave him to them,

214
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:05,480
he goes,

215
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,510
I knew it was legit when I was
fucking people up in video games.

216
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,051
He goes,

217
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:11,240
my video game synapses
would just stop fire.

218
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:11,660
Really?

219
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:11,871
Yeah,

220
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,321
because you're,

221
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,600
you're minus his video games are fucking,

222
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,940
there's a lot of shit
going on in your brain.

223
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,000
Like people think that video
games or vegging out bullshit.

224
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,080
Military Training.

225
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,470
Yeah.

226
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,710
It's when you're playing a really intense
game of counterstrike or something

227
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,460
like that.

228
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:25,701
You know,

229
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,900
I never got into that game,

230
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,570
but because I was really
more one on one games,

231
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,330
but there was a lot of dudes who
would play counterstrike and these

232
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,840
motherfuckers were like literally
virtually going to war that have a land

233
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:39,050
together and then I'll be screaming out
instructions at each other and they all

234
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,880
had headphones on and they'd be playing.

235
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:42,380
Some dudes on the other side of the room,

236
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,030
they were at war.

237
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,320
There was a lot of shit going on.

238
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,221
They had that.

239
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,460
They had that kid who got a concussion
in football and then killed himself like

240
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,294
a day later.

241
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,690
I said he shouldn't have done anything
that would stimulate the brain too much,

242
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:55,010
but he's playing video games
all day and they're like,

243
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,461
absolutely.

244
00:06:55,461 --> 00:06:56,420
Do not do that.

245
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,340
Oh my God.

246
00:06:57,341 --> 00:07:00,170
Your video games and concerts like you
need to rest your brain for a little

247
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:00,490
while.

248
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:00,770
Yeah.

249
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,770
Video Games are really intensely and it
like intensely exciting for the brain

250
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,450
and about a lot of weird areas,

251
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,231
you know?

252
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,970
I mean they get you like
you're really at boards,

253
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,370
digital wars going on,

254
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:13,820
you know,

255
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,970
especially the live one
on one internet battles.

256
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,410
When I first found out that you could,

257
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,330
you could actually play a game
with someone live on the Internet.

258
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,090
I thought that was the coolest
fucking thing I've ever heard of.

259
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,980
The first I didn't know
anything about pains.

260
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,700
So the first time I did it I'd like get
logged on to servers and like Sweden and

261
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:31,941
was like,

262
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,241
yeah,

263
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,130
I want to play some guy
from fucking Sweden.

264
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,790
Sweden.

265
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,200
Yeah.

266
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,033
But it's pretty cool.

267
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,150
Huge lag time.

268
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,250
Like your people are
disappearing in front of you.

269
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,150
You're shooting rockets.

270
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,580
Like you're not getting all the packets
from the game because they're so far

271
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:44,180
away.

272
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,640
So you would have like
a big ping time to them.

273
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,180
We had,

274
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,530
we had Ethan that in college,

275
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,660
it's everyone's connected to carmageddon.

276
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,500
Ooh.

277
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,610
Inbetween levels.

278
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,840
Like whoever won that race,

279
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,171
whatever,

280
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:57,110
we'd all just pour out into the halls
and start like mocking each other for

281
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:57,261
like,

282
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:58,610
while they were loading up the next level.

283
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,630
It was super fun.

284
00:07:59,630 --> 00:07:59,781
Oh,

285
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,460
that's awesome.

286
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:00,700
Yeah.

287
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,040
Yeah.

288
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,020
There's nothing like what,

289
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,380
what video games can
do like as far as like,

290
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,030
like that sort of a sense of a team game.

291
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,590
Almost like a team chess match.

292
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,210
There's nothing like video games.

293
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,310
I mean chess is a brilliant game.

294
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,560
It's an amazing game for,

295
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,220
for like 25 straight
hours playing video games.

296
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:19,401
Yeah.

297
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:20,270
You don't get tired.

298
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,170
You want to keep going.

299
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,350
It's higher to 2:00 AM 8:00 AM you wait,

300
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,360
you get away from the game
and your hands are shaking.

301
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,120
Your whole body is
pulsating with adrenaline.

302
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:29,811
Yeah.

303
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:30,021
Dude.

304
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:31,070
We used to have these ones,

305
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,760
these quake lan matches what we would
all get together and we would like have

306
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,110
death matches where like we would uh,

307
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,820
either have team matches where it'd be
our team and we'd go against other teams.

308
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,780
That was always real fun.

309
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,610
Or we would just fuck each other up.

310
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,660
We would just have melees where
anybody was against everybody.

311
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,700
We just run into a room and everybody
fucking kill everybody until there's one

312
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,840
last man standing.

313
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,520
We should talk about this on the podcast.

314
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:55,320
We should know.

315
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,130
God dammit.

316
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,521
It is.

317
00:08:56,521 --> 00:08:57,354
And it isn't.

318
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,760
Have you ever heard the most
people will get this part right?

319
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,571
Yeah.

320
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:02,310
We have to make our commercials really?

321
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:02,930
Commercials.

322
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,051
Yeah.

323
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:05,930
Eventually I have to shorten
these notes because this big,

324
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,100
because this stuff doesn't get put on.

325
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:09,660
I don't think Sirius radio.

326
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:10,000
I know.

327
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,833
You know what I mean?

328
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,720
On a.com you know what to do,

329
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,340
but really just entering the code name.

330
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,630
Rogan save 10% all right.

331

Cue The music.

00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:27,760
My night all day.

334
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,230
What did you do that
when you slow it by half?

335
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,970
Crafty Devil.

336
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:40,060
It's Dj Red Van

337
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,830
Arch fears of the house.

338
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,020
We've been talking for like 10 15 minutes
about how fucking awesome video games

339
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,870
can be and so the serious
stuff starts right now.

340
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,300
Yes.

341
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:50,590
Yeah.

342
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,250
Wow.

343
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:51,900
Sort of.

344
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,090
Yeah.

345
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,530
That's a lot to do it whenever they want.

346
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:55,660
It really should just
record the commercials.

347
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,580
Maybe I'm they maybe not.

348
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,960
People like it like this.

349
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,650
Yeah.

350
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,520
Some people don't.

351
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,270
You know,

352
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,230
it gives people a reason to listen.

353
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,531
Yeah.

354
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:05,200
It's a conversation more than anything,

355
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,243
you know?

356
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:06,820
Yeah,

357
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,653
I dunno.

358
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,740
I think it's more effective.

359
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,190
I've been listening to us on
Sirius radio so much lately.

360
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,500
Yeah,

361
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,280
it changes my whole look of how we,

362
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,390
I did this part of the podcast.

363
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:20,320
I think it's seems really legit when
you're just driving around and you just

364
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:22,000
flip a radio station and you're like,

365
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:22,571
what the fuck?

366
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:23,310
That's me.

367
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:23,511
Hear you.

368
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:24,520
So yeah,

369
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:25,030
it is radio.

370
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,930
It's still is like wow.

371
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,793
It's still theirs.

372
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,370
Yeah.

373
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,610
Well it's also with the idea of the radio
is it's people that don't necessarily

374
00:10:30,611 --> 00:10:31,480
want to hear you,

375
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,460
so you want to be like a
little better for them.

376
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,830
You know the beans with the
people that are already like you,

377
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,210
like your podcast fans,

378
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:38,044
you already got them.

379
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,350
But if you're on serious and you know
when they click on and you're stumbling

380
00:10:41,351 --> 00:10:43,390
through your words and
sound like a retard,

381
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,071
like what?

382
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:45,611
Who is this?

383
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:45,820
Yeah,

384
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,510
what the fuck?

385
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,400
The fear factor guy has a radio show.

386
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,020
He's saying I'm too much,

387
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,681
but he's saying,

388
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:51,760
you know every other thing,

389
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:52,594
you know,

390
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,291
you know,

391
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,520
I fucking hate that.

392
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:54,881
I say,

393
00:10:54,881 --> 00:10:57,460
you know the ones that
catch about your Sam,

394
00:10:57,461 --> 00:10:58,750
I've been watching that lately.

395
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,261
You know what,

396
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:00,430
I watched a MC,

397
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:01,870
Chris was on your podcast.

398
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:02,591
Very Nice Guy,

399
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:03,190
Mc Chris.

400
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,690
And this is not a criticism of him,

401
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,480
but it made me realize
about myself that he says,

402
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:08,470
you know a lot.

403
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,011
And I'm like,

404
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:09,850
God damn bitch.

405
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:10,450
You do too.

406
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,410
That's what I said to myself.

407
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:11,770
I'm like,

408
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,101
you say,

409
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:13,180
you know all the time,

410
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,751
you know,

411
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:15,250
when you see that somebody else
who can see it in yourself,

412
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,770
it's like a,

413
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,830
it's like a trickery for um,

414
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,060
you know,

415
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,271
you're,

416
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,800
you're pretending you're saying,

417
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,520
um,

418
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,440
but you're saying it with two words.

419
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,720
You know what,

420
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,181
that's not,

421
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:25,421
no,

422
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:25,720
no,

423
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:25,931
no.

424
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:26,231
It's not,

425
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:27,064
you know,

426
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,673
fuck it.

427
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,050
I'm,

428
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,790
what do I say a lot you say,

429
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:31,031
you know,

430
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:31,920
to a lot of us do.

431
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,440
It's,

432
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:32,891
I think it's,

433
00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:33,340
um,

434
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,010
I think it's one of those
things that one of the one,

435
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:36,010
one of us starts doing it.

436
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:36,751
Then we all just saw,

437
00:11:36,751 --> 00:11:39,720
everyone just starts killing argued
on the worst thing I say a lot.

438
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,500
I think like maybe yes,

439
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,370
you are a big like,

440
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,731
yes.

441
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:43,481
You say like a lot,

442
00:11:43,481 --> 00:11:47,470
a lot of girls say like a lot
because that's my way of saying like,

443
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:48,910
here I'll give you a different,

444
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,823
um,

445
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,160
yeah,

446
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,300
well it's good when it works.

447
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,070
That is what you say.

448
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,330
But if it's just like,

449
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,560
you know this like,

450
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,341
so I'm like,

451
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,120
and he's like,

452
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,953
and there's like,

453
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,770
I'm like,

454
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,521
are you serious?

455
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:01,990
Like is this like,

456
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,870
I'm sure like Whoa,

457
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:05,590
like,

458
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,370
you know what I mean?

459
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,203
I'm like,

460
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,520
I don't get it in our feet in the future.

461
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,780
Somehow we're not doc talk and we're
going to have her phone talk for us.

462
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,640
You said something really interesting
the other day that I've been really

463
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:17,800
thinking of when it
was a very valid point.

464
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:20,140
You were saying that
that's what autism is.

465
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,130
That's what people that are emotionless
and that's what it's eventually

466
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,493
digitally,

467
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,730
there really won't be a need for emotions
anymore and it's like that might be

468
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:31,870
the next stage.

469
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,141
You know,

470
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:36,580
a lot of people speculated that what some
of the autism spectrum disorders are,

471
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,940
is the human body possibly making a
change possibly for some new development.

472
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,231
I don't know.

473
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,740
It could be a lot of different things.

474
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:46,070
I mean,

475
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,580
they say there's environmental
factors like look,

476
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,680
like a lot of people say that it's toxins.

477
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,940
There's been arguments about vaccinations
and all sorts of different things.

478
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:55,150
And,

479
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,060
but the idea is that they don't know
what it is or maybe it's that it's just

480
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,170
being diagnosed more.

481
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,790
There's arguments both ways,

482
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,480
but something's happening and there's a
lot of kids that are experiencing this

483
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,580
sort of a disassociated behavior,

484
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,481
you know?

485
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,140
And uh,

486
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,381
it's,

487
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:09,760
it's super unfortunate,

488
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,030
but it might be representing according
to people way smarter than me.

489
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,100
So I don't even know exactly
what they're meaning by this.

490
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,550
Yeah.

491
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,550
But they're saying that it might be
representing a next stage of human beings

492
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,200
and that as a result of all of our,

493
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,920
like technological connection
with each other and you know,

494
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,311
being,

495
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:37,480
being able to text and send pictures and
do everything sort of virtually to each

496
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:37,990
other,

497
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,990
that slowly the human body is having less
and less of a need of the extreme sort

498
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:50,521
of emotional interaction that has sort
of gotten us to where we are today.

499
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,680
I got addicted to the,

500
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,560
to the computer and the phone.

501
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,310
Yeah.

502
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,050
It's like it takes me two hours to go,

503
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,420
just start taking a shower cause I
didn't want me to talk to this again.

504
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,010
And the Facebook and then Twitter.

505
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,840
It's something unhealthy.

506
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:06,110
There's something going on with it.

507
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,940
There's something fascinating about it
is just like what we were talking about

508
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:13,150
earlier about video games that we
were saying that video games are so

509
00:14:13,151 --> 00:14:13,984
stimulated.

510
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,090
Like you never get tired of just the
light is that a lot of it maybe great.

511
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,780
Then the visuals,

512
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,670
really cool graphics.

513
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,040
It's the challenge and people
that want to be a challenge.

514
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:24,341
It's like,

515
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:24,760
again,

516
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,593
it's like anything,

517
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,850
well it's also replacing all that,

518
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,530
those instincts that are in our DNA that
sort of got us to where we are today.

519
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,041
You know,

520
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,190
I've been watching this.

521
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:35,024
It's still,

522
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,620
what's that?

523
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,090
Sit still and just look at things.

524
00:14:37,091 --> 00:14:37,511
Yeah.

525
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:38,344
Move your wrist.

526
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,711
Yeah,

527
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,280
that's,

528
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,750
I mean that's replacing going
out and killing animals.

529
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,590
That's replacing,

530
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,630
fighting off the enemy that's replacing,

531
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:47,141
you know,

532
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:48,250
swimming to safety.

533
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:49,880
Cause your boat breaks a hole in it.

534
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,141
You know what I mean?

535
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,900
I mean this is the world
that we're living in there.

536
00:14:53,901 --> 00:14:58,520
It's not filled with all these needs
for violent explosions and running away

537
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:01,280
from danger and all the
shit bodies program for.

538
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,511
So instead it's,

539
00:15:02,511 --> 00:15:07,511
it's slowly entering to some sort of a
symbiotic relationship with machines.

540
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,360
And as it enters into this
relationship with the machines,

541
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,760
it becomes less and less emotional.

542
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,770
It's less and less
interactive with humans.

543
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:17,060
Less and less dependent on that.

544
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:21,890
And perhaps one day ultimately
not dependent at all
because one day ultimately

545
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:23,810
if you expand on how far,

546
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,710
how much of a connection we have with
computers now and how this didn't even

547
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:30,050
exist at all just a hundred years ago,

548
00:15:30,051 --> 00:15:30,890
no electronics,

549
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:32,420
no nothing a hundred years ago.

550
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,291
Think of it.

551
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:38,210
It's not outside the realm of possibility
to envision some sort of a permanent

552
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,980
and direction that humans are going to
have with some sort of electronic and

553
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:46,260
mark clause that would come out to hold
your phone when you're typing on it.

554
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,350
Something where you know you're much
more interactive virtually than you ever

555
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:56,351
are physically and that you
will eventually become a
part of a fucking system.

556
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,741
Like you will,

557
00:15:57,741 --> 00:15:58,940
you'll become an emotional wreck.

558
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,220
Hard integrated or Yup.

559
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,230
A Borg for real nuts.

560
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:03,890
Right.

561
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,940
Super Possible.

562
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,811
Super Possible.

563
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:06,870
It sounds like a way more evolved.

564
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,090
Well,

565
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,731
you gotta think,

566
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:08,990
I mean,

567
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,970
we're hanging onto these goddamn emotions,

568
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:14,180
these things that make us fly planes
into buildings and these things that make

569
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:14,870
us want to,

570
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,111
you know,

571
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:16,160
Jack other people,

572
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:20,790
and I was reading CNN
today and I'm that guy in,

573
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:20,991
uh,

574
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,400
I believe it's Liberia.

575
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,040
There's just one of them got convicted,

576
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,970
sent a message to the other tyrants.

577
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,780
I ain't gonna send shipper a message.

578
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,381
Yeah.

579
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,620
How has that autonomy or even
close to getting overthrown?

580
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,420
You've already done enough
shit to get tried for.

581
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,051
Yeah.

582
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,220
I never even heard of this.

583
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,054
Charles Taylor.

584
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,470
He's one of the more amazing,

585
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,610
it just didn't have a good name.

586
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,810
That was his only problem.

587
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:42,980
I'm not amazing.

588
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,760
Yup.

589
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,640
He snuck through being
Charles Taylor and just,

590
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,650
just fuck that country.

591
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,550
That's up Liberia,

592
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,690
civil war for years.

593
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,891
What did he do?

594
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,120
What was his exact crime?

595
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,073
I don't know.

596
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,700
Probably killing people because

597
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,670
I dunno,

598
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,503
probably Chile.

599
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:58,920
Maybe.

600
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,040
Jay walked back and forth
like a billion times in a row.

601
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,271
What was his name?

602
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,104
Charles Taylor.

603
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,900
Uh,

604
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,591
my friend Justin,

605
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:07,580
I have a few friends from there,

606
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:08,211
from Liberia,

607
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:09,044
from college.

608
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,130
They were just like talking.

609
00:17:10,131 --> 00:17:11,150
It just ruined everything.

610
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,280
The infrastructure was just
ruined by the civil war,

611
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,620
the whole,

612
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,150
the whole story of Liberia.

613
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:17,901
So crazy.

614
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,460
And we've mentioned this before,

615
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:20,870
but if you haven't heard the episode,

616
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,530
please go and check out
vice guide to Liberia.

617
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,480
You want to see what's up in Liberia?

618
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,190
Holy Shit.

619
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:29,300
Was that fascinating?

620
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,870
They went,

621
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,321
yeah,

622
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:30,821
he went.

623
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:31,450
Shane went,

624
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,540
but trying to get tourism back.

625
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,471
Oh my God,

626
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:34,270
dude,

627
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,270
you got to see this guy's video vice
guide to Liberia is one of the best pieces

628
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:43,520
of online journalism I've ever seen ever.

629
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,080
They went into Liberia,

630
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,070
they explained everything.

631
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:47,060
They showed like these,

632
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,700
these like brothels where it's like
a dollar or something like that,

633
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,680
or 25 cents and was something ridiculous,

634
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,400
you know?

635
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,010
I mean it shows how scary it is there.

636
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,200
And they got talked to that
general butt naked guy.

637
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,280
The guy who was telling them
about how they would kill the,

638
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:05,670
the enemy's babies and eat
their flesh is telling him this.

639
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,091
I mean,

640
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:09,660
he's talking about how we would kill the
flesh and eat the flesh of the innocent

641
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:12,090
child and that that
would make us invincible.

642
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,240
And he would fight naked.

643
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:15,960
And he called them general button
naked cause he would go to war naked.

644
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,280
He would shoot people or as naked.

645
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:17,941
Yeah.

646
00:18:17,941 --> 00:18:21,390
He's responsible for the
deaths of thousands and
thousands of people personally.

647
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,530
Absolutely responsible.

648
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,140
And he became a Christian.

649
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,060
And when he became a Christian,

650
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:27,990
they forgave him.

651
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,190
But yes,

652
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,940
he's a preacher and they forgave him
for all those words because he found the

653
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:33,774
Lord.

654
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,610
Wow.

655
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,443
The Christianity.

656
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,110
It's a crazy story.

657
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:37,920
I mean,

658
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,040
if you're sorry for it.

659
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,481
Yeah.

660
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:43,920
But I mean the fact that he was able to
kill and eat babies and they don't want

661
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:44,754
him in jail.

662
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,150
Yeah.

663
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,210
He would kill and eat innocent children
cause he had a change of heart soon

664
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,044
enough.

665
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:49,921
Yeah.

666
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,760
He found the Lord.

667
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,150
Wow.

668
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:51,421
You know,

669
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,020
that's uh,

670
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,720
well it was just a rehab
and he's already rehab.

671
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,840
Yeah.

672
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,471
I guess he's,

673
00:18:55,471 --> 00:18:56,304
he's out.

674
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,173
He's good.

675
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,990
He feels bad before it's
totally bad for you or whatever.

676
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,220
Like I don't think he was
because he was hungry.

677
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,040
You only did it because he wanted to
be invincible and need to do to be

678
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:08,461
invincible.

679
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:10,410
You had to do something
unbelievably heinous.

680
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,380
And in times of war you
had to be willing to eat.

681
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,120
You'd get like their energy,

682
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,003
I dunno.

683
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,191
Well,

684
00:19:17,191 --> 00:19:20,130
you're committing so far
to terror and horror,

685
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,690
you would probably be,

686
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:22,021
I mean,

687
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:26,430
the preserve occur mentality that they
must've had to be able to do that to

688
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,420
innocent children.

689
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:27,841
I mean,

690
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:30,180
it's just to be completely
inhuman like that.

691
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,950
And then the fact that this guy,

692
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:36,720
all he has to do is I'm just learn about
some old stuff and learn about Jesus

693
00:19:36,721 --> 00:19:39,480
and find the word of God
and where everyone's like,

694
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,170
all right,

695
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,003
we're gonna.

696
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:41,980
We're gonna let you go.

697
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,813
Do

698
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,810
I know you feel bad.

699
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:46,920
You're a priest now.

700
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,000
I mean,

701
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,833
what are you,

702
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,141
I mean,

703
00:19:49,141 --> 00:19:52,270
that is a crazy place to live because
one of it's pretty static kind of text or

704
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:52,890
it can,

705
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,221
oh yeah,

706
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:53,760
he can fuck.

707
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,593
Okay.

708
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,610
Most priests are allowed,

709
00:19:56,611 --> 00:19:57,444
right?

710
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,140
Uh,

711
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,830
yeah.

712
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,580
Half and half.

713
00:19:59,580 --> 00:19:59,881
No,

714
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:00,810
most pretty sorry.

715
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,351
I think,

716
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:01,710
right.

717
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,460
Or not allowed.

718
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,731
Yeah.

719
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:03,031
That's,

720
00:20:03,031 --> 00:20:03,241
I mean,

721
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:03,871
that's what it is.

722
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:04,704
And um,

723
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,870
in Catholicism it's nothing.

724
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,621
Catholicism.

725
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:08,454
I noticed the war.

726
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:09,451
Yeah.

727
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,180
Catholicism.

728
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:10,741
It's nothing,

729
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:11,131
you know,

730
00:20:11,131 --> 00:20:12,000
a lot of fuck anybody.

731
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:12,271
No,

732
00:20:12,271 --> 00:20:13,890
no fucking done period.

733
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,160
But I think that's the only one that
requires you to be completely celebrate,

734
00:20:19,321 --> 00:20:20,040
right?

735
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,670
Oh yeah.

736
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,840
Other ones just to have to be married.

737
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,131
Well,

738
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:22,650
monks,

739
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,870
monks aren't like right
back Buddhist monks are,

740
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:25,090
no,

741
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:25,250
no,

742
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:25,341
no,

743
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,570
that's supposed to fuck that.

744
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:27,181
That makes sense.

745
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:28,410
So they'll go without talking to her.

746
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,421
They had this,

747
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:30,930
um,

748
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,380
uh,

749
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,360
interview with the Dalai Lama recently.

750
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,100
It's funny that everybody's like,

751
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:36,000
listen to this dude.

752
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:36,691
It was,

753
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:38,250
it was a real weird thing.

754
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:38,760
He's like,

755
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,001
you know,

756
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,020
they asked him about women.

757
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,441
It was like,

758
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:40,681
Yo,

759
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:40,810
there's,

760
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,630
sometimes I'm attracted to women,

761
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:43,620
but I think,

762
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,371
oh,

763
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:47,500
it's so much work and I can't
do this Dalai Lama that.

764
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,433
Yeah.

765
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,600
I love his Twitter.

766
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,940
I always check it as it goes.

767
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,251
Yeah.

768
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:51,710
He's,

769
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,040
he really is a cool guy,

770
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,790
I think.

771
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,150
Really?

772
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:55,983
Yeah.

773
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,800
That's cool.

774
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,640
I think so.

775
00:20:57,641 --> 00:20:58,660
He's all positive.

776
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,571
It's funny,

777
00:20:59,571 --> 00:21:00,020
Lama,

778
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,760
his,

779
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,031
I mean,

780
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,050
his argument about,

781
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,380
uh,

782
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,340
being a relationship,

783
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:03,731
she's like,

784
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:04,060
Huh,

785
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,521
I can't,

786
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:05,410
it's too much trouble.

787
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,000
It's not trail off at ease.

788
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:08,110
I mean it is.

789
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,460
He's writing a lot of ways.

790
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,720
So he has sex though.

791
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,190
He would go have a relationship.

792
00:21:12,191 --> 00:21:13,510
I don't think he has it ever has.

793
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,510
I think that's who's a title Mama.

794
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,353
Where did he come from?

795
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,620
Sea as he was born.

796
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,454
The Dalai Lama.

797
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,181
Oh yeah.

798
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:19,610
It was one of,

799
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,480
it's one of those things
where you're sort of a,

800
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,050
I can't think he's like the
16th or something like that.

801
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,931
It's what it is,

802
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:27,070
is beyond ridiculous.

803
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,080
It's not just a dude.

804
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,160
I was thinking of the Gandhi.

805
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:30,821
Is it dude?

806
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:31,390
It's been like,

807
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:31,821
Oh God.

808
00:21:31,821 --> 00:21:32,980
He's a completely different guy.

809
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,380
Yes.

810
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:34,510
Oh,

811
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,350
they should have met though.

812
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,753
I know

813
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,280
they did.

814
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,300
Do we know if they didn't?

815
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,193
I wish they did,

816
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,230
but it looks like he's
old enough to known Gandy.

817
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,981
How old was gone?

818
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:45,081
It,

819
00:21:45,081 --> 00:21:46,030
there's a lot of Dalai Lama's.

820
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:47,830
Then there was some bidding
at one when he was around.

821
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,830
I'm sure there was Gandhi around forties,

822
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,671
50s,

823
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,504
60s.

824
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,550
I'm in the 19 hundreds of thing.

825
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,633
Do you see Adam?

826
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:56,483
Uh,

827
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Jimmy came Oco.

828
00:21:57,501 --> 00:21:58,840
I did that presidents.

829
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,743
Uh,

830
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,191
yeah.

831
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:01,390
What did he exactly say?

832
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:02,224
Can you pull it up?

833
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,440
Oh,

834
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,670
did,

835
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,740
that was the word about
the big marijuana he did.

836
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:06,730
Oh yeah.

837
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,563
That's so good.

838
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,620
He started if he was okay,

839
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:11,470
he started strong and I'm going a little
slow for a while and then by the time

840
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:13,210
we got to the marijuana I
was like tuned out already.

841
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:13,960
Oh really?

842
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,171
Yeah.

843
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:14,910
I was like,

844
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,410
I think there's just skirting over
my head and then he ended up strong.

845
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,060
No,

846
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,251
he,

847
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:19,970
it was just an uncomfortable situation.

848
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,180
You asked like how many people
here have not smoked pot?

849
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,260
Yeah.

850
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,230
And then like maybe a quarter of the
crowd raise our hand and then I think he

851
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:27,130
made his point from there.

852
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:27,881
Yeah.

853
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,160
It's play the shit out of it.

854
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,090
Yeah.

855
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:31,923
Beautiful.

856
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,150
Now this is the whole thing.

857
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:34,730
Yeah,

858
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,290
I know.

859
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,123
I can find it.

860
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:36,790
Oh,

861
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,520
I bet you can hear a fucking
animal wants you find it.

862
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,270
Not only for a sentence,

863
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:41,820
the,

864
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,920
it was the jackass.

865
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,620
Which no offense sir,

866
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:49,970
but I think you got the wrong lesson.

867
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:50,860
I think you met Allen.

868
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,940
This is the boring person that was already
these guys lined with a perfect body.

869
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:57,521
George Clooney,

870
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:58,570
just members of the media,

871
00:22:58,571 --> 00:22:59,351
politicians,

872
00:22:59,351 --> 00:23:00,490
corporate executives,

873
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,660
advertisers,

874
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:03,220
lobbyists and celebrities.

875
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,800
Everything that is wrong
with America is here in this

876
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,683
from tonight.

877
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,191
Unfortunately,

878
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:09,911
the speaker of the house,

879
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:10,550
John Bain,

880
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,351
was on my class,

881
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,400
I think from last year.

882
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,670
Nancy Pelosi believes in lipstick the
same way she believes in government.

883
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,110
Too much is never enough.

884
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,833
Jake tapper.

885
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,730
That's how he was discovered.

886
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,790
Some people say Mitt Romney will
be elected president because he's

887
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,290
secondly,

888
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,900
we're really smart,

889
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,551
but what are you doing?

890
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:28,100
Bryan?

891
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:28,581
Five is off.

892
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:30,050
Then I'm going to play a little bit,

893
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,263
right

894
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,210
any end.

895
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,340
Rick Santorum may not
have won the nomination,

896
00:23:37,341 --> 00:23:39,410
but he succeeded in
getting his message out,

897
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:43,160
not just to Americans but to
people all a flat the world.

898
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,550
Paul is still in there.

899
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:49,720
He's still sticking with it to me.

900
00:23:49,721 --> 00:23:53,080
Ron Paul looks like the guy who gets
unloaded hooded at the end of every Scooby

901
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:53,914
doo epics.

902
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,990
It's great to see the Gingrich's here
tonight because I guess that means the

903
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:04,824
check cleared.

904
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,230
Oh Shit.

905
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:08,790
Nude.

906
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,361
I have a question.

907
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:12,810
How can you be against gay marriage
when you yourself are the son of two gay

908
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:13,650
parents,

909
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,390
the Michelin man and the stay puft
marshmallow man stumble a marshmallow.

910
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:20,640
I don't understand politicians
who are against gay marriage.

911
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:23,280
I don't understand anyone is against
gay marriage and where when you really

912
00:24:23,281 --> 00:24:24,114
think about it,

913
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,770
aren't all marriages kind of gay?

914
00:24:25,771 --> 00:24:26,604
I mean,

915
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,563
hello

916
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,150
as a man when you get married,

917
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:32,960
essentially what you're saying is I will
never touch another woman as long as I

918
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,610
live now.

919
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:36,680
Let's put jewelry on each other and dance.

920
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,040
Not that it's any of my business,

921
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:41,641
Mr Gingrich,

922
00:24:41,641 --> 00:24:43,890
but why are you waiting until
Tuesday to drop out of this?

923
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,821
Just do it now.

924
00:24:44,821 --> 00:24:44,971
It's,

925
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:45,121
oh,

926
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,350
it's time to meet or get off.

927
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,184
The Pot.

928
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,270
Electoral process has changed
a lot over the last 10 years.

929
00:24:51,271 --> 00:24:51,661
As you know,

930
00:24:51,661 --> 00:24:53,170
the president of finally gave in and

931
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,250
of Guardian and hit one of those big
boxes of all the different kinds of chips

932
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,790
we can get to the pot part.

933
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,813
Super committed.

934
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,790
Super Committees are two committees.

935
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,500
What super cuts is to cuts the
TV in 2000 and list of Madison.

936
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,480
Let's take a quick poll is so good at
this is your hand if you've never smoked

937
00:25:21,481 --> 00:25:22,314
pot.

938
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,561
Brit Hume,

939
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,580
he's high riding now

940
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,830
he's on his fourth almond macaroon.

941
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,761
Mr President,

942
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:35,900
I hope you don't think
I'm out of line here,

943
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,500
but marijuana is something that real
people care about and the fact that you

944
00:25:39,501 --> 00:25:42,590
believe Speaker Baner when he tells you
he's still has control of his party,

945
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,980
leads me to believe that you must be
smoking some crazy great weed yourself.

946
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,960
Okay.

947
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,430
Woody Harrelson just woke up.

948
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,640
Okay.

949
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,271
As we know now,

950
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:53,200
last year at this dinner,

951
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:56,920
President Obama had his team on
the way to kill Osama bin Laden it.

952
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,850
Yeah.

953
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,750
He's so good at that,

954
00:25:58,751 --> 00:25:59,230
man.

955
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,450
That guy is a,

956
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,080
he's in my opinion,

957
00:26:02,081 --> 00:26:04,030
I think he's the best
talk show host alive.

958
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,241
Yeah,

959
00:26:04,241 --> 00:26:05,074
it's pretty fun.

960
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,970
He's the best at like weaving
between ninth is sort of a subtle,

961
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,451
you know,

962
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:15,451
he's fucking around like way of
talking with like being like a very,

963
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,480
very professional expressive and Alex
or it's like he's so good at it man.

964
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,770
I think he's got a few times to watch
cause fire guys a warm up so it'll stand

965
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,410
like a thought.

966
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,880
I don't think he gets
the credit he deserves.

967
00:26:27,881 --> 00:26:30,560
I think Jimmy Kim was the best talk show
host in the country and the other one's

968
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:31,420
all done right.

969
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:35,170
Well except I still love
Letterman cause he's just,

970
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,340
to me Letterman is just,

971
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,540
he's a staple.

972
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:37,721
I'll,

973
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,011
I'll,

974
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:40,360
I'll watch those things cause
we grew up interview that.

975
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:41,194
He'll do,

976
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,550
you know,

977
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,390
once a year.

978
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,673
I just,

979
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:44,160
I've,

980
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,500
I've always just the guy he's sold,

981
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,000
he's got so much histories.

982
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,740
I mean Letterman is so good.

983
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,610
He's so quick.

984
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,410
Yeah.

985
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,560
Spin around for so long.

986
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:53,770
And I think Jon Stewart too.

987
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,960
I don't watch Jon Stewart is it's so
committed to politics and that that

988
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:58,580
political shit.

989
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:58,711
I don't,

990
00:26:58,711 --> 00:26:59,730
I don't watch it as much.

991
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,560
Maybe as I would if it was a,

992
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:02,010
just a,

993
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,590
like if Jon Stewart had his own
show instead of just the daily show,

994
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:07,740
but I think he's also one of the past
matter goes on it all the time now.

995
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,850
Yeah.

996
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,091
Yeah.

997
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:09,601
I'll magical.

998
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:10,321
It's like one of the,

999
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:11,154
um,

1000
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,331
what did,

1001
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:13,280
what did they have him?

1002
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,610
Whatever correspondence.

1003
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,230
How magical is this shit?

1004
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,180
He's such a great guy.

1005
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,650
Yeah.

1006
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,280
That uh,

1007
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,870
that guy's the best til easily.

1008
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:22,141
I mean,

1009
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,590
I think he's the best at political
stuff that cove the shore.

1010
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,510
That fucking tastes great until he does.

1011
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:27,811
It's like,

1012
00:27:27,811 --> 00:27:29,640
how does it keep this character?

1013
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:30,474
To me,

1014
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,270
it keeps it going to take
the opposite approach.

1015
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,560
Smart opposite side.

1016
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:35,970
In order to mark that opposite side.

1017
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,260
He must be smart as fuck.

1018
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,670
He must be smart as fuck.

1019
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,450
Yeah.

1020
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:39,901
I'm sure.

1021
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:40,734
Yes.

1022
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,480
You're talking about the
airplanes landing in Israel.

1023
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,400
What's that?

1024
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,850
We're talking about his wife
couldn't pull over in Israel.

1025
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:48,751
Oh,

1026
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:49,920
Brian's girl.

1027
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,510
You said wife,

1028
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,800
you just get the shit out of me.

1029
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,570
What'd you do?

1030
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,440
I got married.

1031
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,210
Oh Dude,

1032
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:57,990
you,

1033
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,300
I'm your girl that you were seeing,

1034
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:00,690
right?

1035
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,020
Uh,

1036
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,000
went to Israel by herself,

1037
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:03,600
you were saying?

1038
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:03,841
Yeah,

1039
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:05,100
she decided she wanted to,

1040
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,331
she does that.

1041
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,260
She likes to travel.

1042
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:07,730
So she'll,

1043
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,920
she wanted to go do a yoga
yoga retreat in Israel,

1044
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:15,090
which is one of these places that you go
to just relax and it's kind of like a,

1045
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,051
yeah,

1046
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,160
but it's a place you've lit.

1047
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:18,390
Can live there also.

1048
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,890
Tivity help out there.

1049
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:20,520
It's like a real,

1050
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:20,780
like,

1051
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,040
I guess I'd temperature Wheelock.

1052
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,160
Right.

1053
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,670
What's it called?

1054
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,421
Rancho relaxo.

1055
00:28:24,421 --> 00:28:25,254
Something like that.

1056
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,091
I forget the name of it.

1057
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:27,880
Some Jewish names.

1058
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,160
You don't have to relax off from that one.

1059
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,030
Okay.

1060
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,863
What George?

1061
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,420
Although with the mud and not a lot,

1062
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:33,951
but that's,

1063
00:28:33,951 --> 00:28:34,320
see,

1064
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:34,471
yeah.

1065
00:28:34,471 --> 00:28:35,220
What's it called?

1066
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:35,910
But see,

1067
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,743
no,

1068
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,390
it's like some kinds of
company that's there.

1069
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,070
I don't know.

1070
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,890
She goes see Israel and yoga retreat and,

1071
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:46,380
and so because you bought her
ticket last second and uh,

1072
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,880
because she was going by herself,

1073
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,270
I guess she,

1074
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:49,650
you know,

1075
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:50,910
she's not Jewish.

1076
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:53,670
And I guess it's at a time of war kind of.

1077
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:54,960
It's kind of worry right now.

1078
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,490
And like,

1079
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,430
so they took her luggage for
like three or four days and uh,

1080
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,310
she had to buy all new clothes
and they thought she wears,

1081
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:04,770
you know,

1082
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,330
got questioned up and down,

1083
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:06,811
you know.

1084
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:07,690
And uh,

1085
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,470
I guess they really thought
that she was some kind of like,

1086
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,041
you know,

1087
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:11,874
terrorist thing.

1088
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,060
There was a girl who was
a Jewish photographer when
she was over in Israel and

1089
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:16,770
she was taking pictures and they leave.

1090
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:21,510
What's no of a artwork like
a Palestinian graffiti.

1091
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,710
And uh,

1092
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,200
since she had a photo of it on her laptop,

1093
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,630
the guys at the Israel,

1094
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,400
the tea has their version of Tsa.

1095
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,050
They shot her laptop,

1096
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,580
the shot it,

1097
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,830
they fucking shot it and
they gave it back to her.

1098
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,710
They blew a hole through it.

1099
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,360
Yeah.

1100
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,731
Can I think,

1101
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:38,880
just take out the hard drive and go,

1102
00:29:38,881 --> 00:29:39,220
all right,

1103
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,500
here's your laptop back.

1104
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,963
Where did they shoot?

1105
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,320
They shot it in the back.

1106
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:48,850
She heard a bang and then the guy comes
out and gives her a laptop and it's got

1107
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:49,660
a bullet hole on it.

1108
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,380
It's crazy.

1109
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,213
It's just,

1110
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,930
I think he's trying to let her know,

1111
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:54,020
like you,

1112
00:29:54,021 --> 00:29:54,854
you don't,

1113
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,130
I don't think he knew
that she was a journalist.

1114
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:01,780
I think she probably thought she was
someone that was seeing this and she was

1115
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,830
taking pictures of it,

1116
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:07,330
like she thought it was funny or cool
or whatever for whatever disrespectful

1117
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:07,661
reason.

1118
00:30:07,661 --> 00:30:10,390
This chick had it on her laptop
and his eyes and he was like,

1119
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:10,481
oh,

1120
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:11,020
really?

1121
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:11,381
Yeah,

1122
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:13,930
you let you like looking at
that and you're like looking
at someone talking shit

1123
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:14,590
about us,

1124
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:15,430
so he fucking,

1125
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,810
so he'd just run down a hall,

1126
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,940
pass on graffiti and shot it.

1127
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,091
No,

1128
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:21,250
he checked all her stuff and
as he's checking her laptop,

1129
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,410
he went through all of her photographs
and as he's going through her

1130
00:30:23,411 --> 00:30:23,981
photographs,

1131
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:28,210
he saw this antisemetic graffiti
that she had photographs of,

1132
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,290
so he closes it,

1133
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,210
pushes it aside and fucking shoots it.

1134
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,140
Wow.

1135
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:32,973
Yeah,

1136
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,263
pretty intense.

1137
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,740
I just know how to shoot.

1138
00:30:35,741 --> 00:30:36,770
She travels though.

1139
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,570
I know that she probably had at least 20
to 30 different vibrators or dildos are

1140
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:42,261
sex toys in there,

1141
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:45,530
so I wonder if that they thought all
that shit with some kind of weapon,

1142
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,130
so I could just imagine all these Jewish
guys like with these big vibrators.

1143
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:49,460
It's like,

1144
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,720
I think it's okay.

1145
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:53,911
Yeah.

1146
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:55,130
At least they searched everybody.

1147
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,740
There is such a massive difference
between Jews in America,

1148
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,783
Jews in Israel,

1149
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,820
there's really no one's there to

1150
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:04,950
consider because of the aesthetics.

1151
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,420
She said she went right to the beach
and it was just dirty and scary and then

1152
00:31:09,421 --> 00:31:10,140
she went to,

1153
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,460
Oh,

1154
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,270
a couple of the places that,

1155
00:31:12,271 --> 00:31:15,480
and it was just really freaky because
there was people who are walking around

1156
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,750
with machine guns and then she said there
was a lot of gay people and one of the

1157
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:19,560
cities,

1158
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,310
because I guess that's
just new thing there,

1159
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,280
that new thing.

1160
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:26,040
Gay people go there visit gigantic.

1161
00:31:26,041 --> 00:31:26,460
Yes.

1162
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,180
Yeah.

1163
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,320
That's where she landed television.

1164
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:28,801
I think so.

1165
00:31:28,801 --> 00:31:28,950
Yeah.

1166
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:29,040
Yeah.

1167
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,460
The beaches are not dangerous by the way.

1168
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,000
The army people don't know all the time.

1169
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,050
It takes some time ago.

1170
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:36,460
He was telling.

1171
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,280
How long did you live in Israel for?

1172
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:38,851
Two years.

1173
00:31:38,851 --> 00:31:39,540
Two and a half years.

1174
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,151
Two and a half years.

1175
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:40,650
That's crazy.

1176
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,580
What was it like for you?

1177
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,833
It was great.

1178
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,770
It's such a beautiful country and
Jerusalem is all built out of stone,

1179
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,920
pretty much down the old
Jerusalem and everywhere.

1180
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:50,754
It's just like,

1181
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:51,481
yeah,

1182
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:51,990
things are great.

1183
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,870
Everybody sort of knows
each other a little bit.

1184
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,741
Not like completely,

1185
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:56,191
but they're all,

1186
00:31:56,191 --> 00:32:00,510
I mean until recently you could hitchhike
everywhere really in between places

1187
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,430
and you just tell him
completely different now though,

1188
00:32:02,431 --> 00:32:03,110
right?

1189
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,270
Yeah,

1190
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,240
the intifadas change the tanks,

1191
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,650
but the uprising,

1192
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,080
the Palestinian uprising,

1193
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,471
that's what they call it.

1194
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,030
The end of file [inaudible] so yeah,

1195
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,893
that's what they call it.

1196
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,003
Wow.

1197
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,050
What is the issue giving up land?

1198
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,670
What's the actual issue?

1199
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,070
Actual issues Palestinians started in,

1200
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,740
their chief tenant was,

1201
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:26,040
we want to drive the Israelis into the
sea and they're never going to give up on

1202
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:26,760
that.

1203
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,570
How was in their books?

1204
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,403
That's what they wanted.

1205
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:33,750
They will never rest until
all the Israelis are driven
into the oceans that says

1206
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,530
they want.

1207
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:37,110
So in the meantime you have to figure
out a way to like appease enough of them

1208
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,160
to give them the right amount of
land and let the other ones not

1209
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,780
keep going to war with us with them.

1210
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,340
So when you say that that's in,

1211
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,061
it's in their book,

1212
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:45,770
is that like in one of
the religious books?

1213
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:45,951
No,

1214
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:49,670
the PLO when they started that was
one of the Palestinian Liberation

1215
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:53,050
Organization and that was linked a lot
of terrorist shit in the 1970s right?

1216
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,610
Wasn't that the Munich Munich articles?

1217
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,211
Yeah,

1218
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:57,044
the uh,

1219
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,090
the killings at the,

1220
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,331
at the Olympic Games.

1221
00:32:59,331 --> 00:32:59,660
Yeah.

1222
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,493
Right.

1223
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,800
So what's the other side say?

1224
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:01,981
Like,

1225
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:02,071
well,

1226
00:33:02,071 --> 00:33:04,030
what's their story like
if you talked to Sam Aaa,

1227
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:09,050
what would he say that Pam would say
he's Armenian and quit downplaying his

1228
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:11,820
struggle for the struggle
of the Palestinians.

1229
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:12,421
He goes,

1230
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:15,150
no one ever fucking
respects those Armenians.

1231
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:16,140
The Turks wipe them out.

1232
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:17,901
Genocide.

1233
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:21,340
I didn't even hear about it until
Manny GAM Berean I was doing,

1234
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,580
he kind of bursary of
the Armenian genocide.

1235
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:26,950
I,

1236
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,710
I'm honest,

1237
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,790
I just didn't know about it.

1238
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,160
Um,

1239
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,140
I'm ignorant to it.

1240
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,190
It was because the only
1 million people died.

1241
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,293
Got another word.

1242
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,810
Fucking incredible that there's been so
many horrible things like that that have

1243
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:41,060
happened in the history of the world.

1244
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:41,690
Rather,

1245
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,050
you know that this Armenian genocide
could be something that I wasn't aware of.

1246
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:48,320
I mean it's hate [inaudible] hate them.

1247
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,640
Well when I was kid I,

1248
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:53,090
there was a kid that I used
to train with who was a,

1249
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:56,600
he was Turkish and they hated the Greeks.

1250
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,630
Like Greeks and Turkish hated each other.

1251
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,020
Really?

1252
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,853
Yeah.

1253
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,993
Wow.

1254
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,230
No,

1255
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,690
Pakistan,

1256
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,970
India hates each other.

1257
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,893
Cut boots.

1258
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,490
I always thought it was so ridiculous.

1259
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:08,324
It was like a kibbutz.

1260
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,680
Turks and Greeks really
in there in his eyes,

1261
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:12,951
man.

1262
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:13,401
It was like,

1263
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:14,960
it was like a serious conversation.

1264
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,750
It was just,

1265
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,490
it was smart.

1266
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:16,670
Yeah.

1267
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,610
People get nationalistic.

1268
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,700
I saw that bloody diva,

1269
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,800
a documentary about him wherever
he was from going to war,

1270
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,280
you know,

1271
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,113
internal strife,

1272
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,540
maybe Czechoslovakia or Hungary and a,

1273
00:34:27,541 --> 00:34:30,210
and his teammates were like all abandoned
him cause he wanted to like unity and

1274
00:34:30,211 --> 00:34:31,170
they wanted to break off.

1275
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,990
And there's all these like
people there that were like 25,

1276
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:34,411
26,

1277
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:38,550
like waving like the break off
flags are getting really passionate.

1278
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:39,384
I'm like,

1279
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:39,661
well,

1280
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,010
I've never been into shit like that.

1281
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,820
Like I'm just,

1282
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,560
we were all just like video
games and whatever else.

1283
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:43,951
There was like,

1284
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:45,240
I can't imagine caring.

1285
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:45,661
Well,

1286
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:47,010
you had this enough,

1287
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,270
but you would if you were there.

1288
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:48,800
Yeah,

1289
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,300
you will.

1290
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,050
What are the east coast was trying to
break off and there was this nationalistic

1291
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,880
feel for the east coast and
we're different than them.

1292
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,860
Would you get caught up in
it when you were little?

1293
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,440
If you lived in that environment,

1294
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,430
it's unlikely you would,

1295
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,380
I guess be a Yankee Fan.

1296
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,680
It's so easy to imitate your ass over.

1297
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,560
It's so easy to get sucked up
in the wave of your atmosphere.

1298
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,970
It's just so weird when you think about
how much human behavior can vary from

1299
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:11,990
spot to spot.

1300
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,210
We have no strife and soquel yeah,

1301
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,570
that wasn't,

1302
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:14,841
no,

1303
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:15,261
no.

1304
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:15,470
Uh,

1305
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,490
dealing with the weather that are only
problems are so many of us and we need a

1306
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:20,120
lot of food.

1307
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,870
Yeah.

1308
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,130
No War overseas us,

1309
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,993
we'd,

1310
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,350
yeah,

1311
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,790
your perspective here,

1312
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,180
that's why someone like Paris Hilton
can be so offensive to people in other

1313
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:30,014
parts of the world.

1314
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,670
Someone was just shallowly trying to
attract attention to herself for no for no

1315
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:35,504
reason at all.

1316
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,050
And when,

1317
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,740
when it's successful angers you.

1318
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:42,510
It's like why is this even projected in
front of me in a time where people are

1319
00:35:42,511 --> 00:35:43,680
just dying?

1320
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,900
Paris Hilton.

1321
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,141
Sure.

1322
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:50,190
That's one of the reasons because there's
so vapid cause behind wanting to be

1323
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,870
famous only for being famous.

1324
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,800
It's so vapid.

1325
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,480
There's enough other
people who are into it.

1326
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,540
Well this is why they keep it on
like that and the Kardashians.

1327
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,950
The issue is it opened up a whole new
category of human being and that category

1328
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:06,410
of human being is the same as
professional celebrity for no reasons.

1329
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:06,990
Celebrity,

1330
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:07,461
the the,

1331
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:08,100
the,

1332
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,170
the person who sneaks through the net
and creates a whole new genre and it's

1333
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,030
essentially Kim Kardashian
is a reality celebrity,

1334
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,280
but she's a hugely successful
media personality and she
did it from being just a

1335
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:23,640
person who fucked a guy in a video.

1336
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:23,881
I mean,

1337
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,060
the whole thing is really like
I'd heard dad was a lawyer.

1338
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:27,390
Yeah.

1339
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,470
And not only that,

1340
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:29,780
a famous and a lawyer,

1341
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,860
a famous lawyer who got Oj Simpson off,

1342
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,830
but the whole thing behind
it is that it's this,

1343
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:40,440
this weird desire to get
attention for no reason.

1344
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,310
Other than that,

1345
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,950
you want attention not offering anything.

1346
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,840
You just want people to look at you.

1347
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:46,800
You're not trying to sing,

1348
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,840
he just want people to follow you around.

1349
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,130
It's like a lot of people want that,

1350
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:52,230
but only something that is so specific.

1351
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:54,300
It must be so hard to arrange.

1352
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:54,800
You know?

1353
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:54,991
I mean,

1354
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:55,061
you,

1355
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:56,670
you're not trying to do anything.

1356
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:57,380
Like,

1357
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,170
I want to be famous.

1358
00:36:58,170 --> 00:36:59,003
What do you do?

1359
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,030
I don't do anything.

1360
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:01,070
But then people keep walking.

1361
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,130
So then you feel entirely like,

1362
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:02,251
well,

1363
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:02,971
lots of great stuff.

1364
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:03,600
Like what?

1365
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,770
What are these great things you do?

1366
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:04,941
Well,

1367
00:37:04,941 --> 00:37:06,000
she fucked on video.

1368
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:06,211
I mean,

1369
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:07,530
really that was the catalyst.

1370
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:08,670
That's what started it all off.

1371
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,950
So they both did the same thing.

1372
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,310
They both fucked on video and that got
him into the spotlight and now you're

1373
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:15,690
getting the white spots now.

1374
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,680
That's amazing,

1375
00:37:16,681 --> 00:37:16,940
man.

1376
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,840
It is really an amazing trick.

1377
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:19,770
It's fascinating.

1378
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,371
It launched Paris,

1379
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:20,820
hold them from it.

1380
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,610
Just a model to of those reality shows.

1381
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,540
Yeah.

1382
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:24,961
Yeah.

1383
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:25,171
And,

1384
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:25,520
and,

1385
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,900
but Kim Kardashians far
eclipse Paris Hilton,

1386
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:31,620
which is even more fantastic because
Paris Hilton now does interviews and they

1387
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:31,981
ask her,

1388
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:33,510
are you worried that your population,

1389
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:35,130
your popularity might be waning?

1390
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:36,420
And she got up and left.

1391
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,640
He got pissed and totally,

1392
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:37,930
yeah.

1393
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,190
Told her publicist deserve it.

1394
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,190
Why would it go away?

1395
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,211
That's still done.

1396
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:43,044
Nothing.

1397
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,150
So how could it go?

1398
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:44,821
He's not thinking.

1399
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:46,200
He's nearly as clearly as yo,

1400
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,710
she's,

1401
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,341
she's thinking,

1402
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:48,390
why would a,

1403
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,860
I'm still awesome,

1404
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,710
Ashley.

1405
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,543
For me,

1406
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,210
she's probably a fine person.

1407
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:54,421
Look,

1408
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:56,700
I probably know she was
probably not a five.

1409
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,990
Why not?

1410
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,310
She's self a titled,

1411
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,061
no way.

1412
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,320
She's probably a fine person.

1413
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,060
I bet if she was sucking your cock,

1414
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:07,440
I think you'd have to be great at
sucking Dick [inaudible] with her.

1415
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,440
You were hanging out with her and maybe
she's a little crazy and she grew up

1416
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:10,921
weird,

1417
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:11,460
but hey,

1418
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,121
she's a kind.

1419
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:14,550
I would give her a chance
because I want the blow job.

1420
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:14,911
Yeah,

1421
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:16,050
I think that'd be a real possibility.

1422
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:17,160
I wouldn't be mean right away,

1423
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,370
but there's no way she wouldn't
be helping you right away,

1424
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,210
but be batching your life in any way
that's maybe not like a 5% chance.

1425
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,950
Maybe get her high on mushrooms
and straighten her out.

1426
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:26,281
And Dude,

1427
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:27,060
maybe it's you.

1428
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,070
Maybe it's Ari who can
straighten the whole thing out.

1429
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,710
Who better than the founder mushroom fest.

1430
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,280
That's right.

1431
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,510
Liquid.

1432
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,440
The aren't talking to swim fast.

1433
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:33,680
Sure.

1434
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,920
We're going to date now July,

1435
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,880
2020 second and 23rd.

1436
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,631
Yeah.

1437
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:38,231
And by the way,

1438
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:38,741
Ladies and gentlemen,

1439
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:40,390
you don't have to go
anywhere for shrimp fest.

1440
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:41,823
Press comes to you.

1441
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,550
Beautiful thing is trim
fest is a trip and go,

1442
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:44,741
oh,

1443
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:45,250
don't do it.

1444
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,430
If it's illegal way,

1445
00:38:46,431 --> 00:38:47,700
you are talking Shataki guy.

1446
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:47,941
Yeah,

1447
00:38:47,941 --> 00:38:48,290
whatever.

1448
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:48,730
Yeah,

1449
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,241
don't do it.

1450
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:49,930
If it's illegal,

1451
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,500
you live.

1452
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,900
We don't want you to do
anything silly and going,

1453
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,770
you know what I heard
they made in Amsterdam,

1454
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:55,690
they made them illegal because some kids,

1455
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:55,990
uh,

1456
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:58,990
jumped out of a building
or something like that.

1457
00:38:58,991 --> 00:38:59,824
Bill Hicks joke,

1458
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:02,290
young man on acid thought he could fly,

1459
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,401
jumped off the roof.

1460
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,390
What a tragedy goes.

1461
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,070
What a tragedy when a deck,

1462
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,151
if you thought he could fly,

1463
00:39:07,151 --> 00:39:08,800
why don't you start off
on the ground first?

1464
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:09,941
That's fine.

1465
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:10,161
A lot of,

1466
00:39:10,161 --> 00:39:11,370
they all get a top speakers.

1467
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,030
He goes,

1468
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,230
oh,

1469
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,660
lost two more on the world.

1470
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:14,620
Got a little lighter.

1471
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,243
That's funny.

1472
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,620
Are you like a Hicks Joe?

1473
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,070
See it's one of his best.

1474
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:21,700
Yeah,

1475
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,060
no,

1476
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,180
I would ask to hear him say
it taught me also had this,

1477
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,700
you never hear a positive
drug store in the news.

1478
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:30,760
And I don't want to butcher this
because I don't want to paraphrase it,

1479
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,410
but as young man on acid,

1480
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:32,711
you know,

1481
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:36,130
and it was a beautiful positive
message that he learned from acid.

1482
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:36,460
Yeah,

1483
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,600
I've got to go a bunch of great,

1484
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,620
great drug jokes.

1485
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,300
It's just weird that he quit drugs
so young and then died so young.

1486
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:48,010
The human body is so fucking
for some folks so fragile.

1487
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,000
You know,

1488
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,780
I've been reading about these
people that get these weird,

1489
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,673
um,

1490
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,710
like fibers growing out of their skin.

1491
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,573
Have you heard of this?

1492
00:39:57,950 --> 00:39:59,090
What does that shit call again?

1493
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,453
It's disgusting.

1494
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,020
I was introduced to it on,

1495
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:02,530
um,

1496
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,460
there was like one of those,

1497
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:08,461
a conspiracy theory shows like there's
Jesse Ventura conspiracy theory shows and

1498
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,840
they were talking about chem trails.

1499
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,321
It was Kevin.

1500
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:11,541
Sheryl,

1501
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:11,691
yeah.

1502
00:40:11,691 --> 00:40:12,700
Something to do with chem shells.

1503
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,593
More Jealous.

1504
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,090
Hold on a second.

1505
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,300
Let me,

1506
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,230
let me pull this one.

1507
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,940
Certain town in California and like a
lot of them and then what people start

1508
00:40:18,941 --> 00:40:19,680
growing fibers out of.

1509
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,513
This

1510
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:23,830
totally sounds like complete horse shit.

1511
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,000
But um,

1512
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,370
the pictures are really bizarre man.

1513
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,863
It's a,

1514
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,680
it's,

1515
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,980
there's like actual fiber
that's coming out of their skin.

1516
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,701
Like look,

1517
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:33,911
all right,

1518
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:34,750
can I check this out

1519
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,010
for the ILS just says this is a,

1520
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,841
this is something,

1521
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:45,160
a fiber that they pulled out of someone's
skin that had this more jealous.

1522
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:45,850
I mean,

1523
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,181
yeah,

1524
00:40:46,181 --> 00:40:48,880
it looks like a sweaters
growing inside of you.

1525
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:50,810
It looks like a mosquito down of that.

1526
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,310
Yeah.

1527
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,770
Well that picture is like pretty extreme,

1528
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,140
but it goes around what a,

1529
00:40:56,141 --> 00:40:56,411
I mean,

1530
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:59,020
what a fucking weird disease man.

1531
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,690
And no one knows what the hell that is.

1532
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,160
I mean,

1533
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:03,851
these people,

1534
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:07,720
some of them have gloves on and they
have these fucking hairs that are growing

1535
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:09,070
out of all over their body.

1536
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,760
It's a relatively new problems,

1537
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:14,050
seems to be growing in leaps and
bounds throughout the u s even in other

1538
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:14,471
countries.

1539
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:18,580
Although condition where Jones possibly
dates back to the 16 hundreds it's only

1540
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:20,980
been since 2002 that it's become a modern,

1541
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:21,850
dank concern.

1542
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,110
It's probably has something to do it.

1543
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:23,944
The Internet.

1544
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,023
Wow.

1545
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:25,540
Wow.

1546
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,250
Like wifi where we're growing wires and
you imagine if that was really what it

1547
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:31,350
is growing in tennis.

1548
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,440
Jesus Christ,

1549
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:32,651
you know,

1550
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:33,530
crazy would be,

1551
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,210
that's the next stage of development
and autism and I'm tell us different

1552
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:38,541
things.

1553
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,930
We can't keep thinking that we're
going to stay the way we are.

1554
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,381
I know,

1555
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:42,570
but it's,

1556
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:46,070
is this supposed to happen so slowly that
you would never in one lifetime notice

1557
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:46,904
any change?

1558
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,900
How do we know that?

1559
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:48,231
You know,

1560
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:51,770
there's been a lot of discrepancies
about like how long it takes.

1561
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,220
There's a,

1562
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,860
there's a lot of arguments
and disagreements about
how long it takes for an

1563
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:56,450
entity to evolve,

1564
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:59,090
but one of the things that
they know is the Congo.

1565
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,830
The Congo is a kind of a crazy place
where it used to be grasslands and then a

1566
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:08,831
rain forests essentially grew there
really rapidly and over a period of 2000

1567
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:11,600
years became a dent,

1568
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,390
massive rain forest where
it used to be grasslands,

1569
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:19,391
so all these grasslands animals got
trapped in the jungle and had to evolve.

1570
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:21,290
They had to change and one of them,

1571
00:42:21,291 --> 00:42:21,730
there's a,

1572
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:26,590
an antelope thing called a
Diker and how much time whims,

1573
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,673
how much time is this?

1574
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,730
Less than 2000 years.

1575
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,000
Swims underwater and eat fish.

1576
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:32,570
Really?

1577
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,403
Yeah.

1578
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,150
It's in the answer when family,

1579
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:35,810
it's called,

1580
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:37,160
I think it's called a Diker.

1581
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:37,730
Wow.

1582
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,060
Yeah.

1583
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,040
It actually swims underwater
and fucking eats fish.

1584
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,860
It can swim under water
for a hundred yards.

1585
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,520
Whoa.

1586
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:43,931
How is it?

1587
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:44,260
What is,

1588
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,140
where'd that come from?

1589
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:45,951
I'll tell you why.

1590
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:47,500
They had to figure out how to survive.

1591
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,430
Somebody has the part like
let's say grow a third eye.

1592
00:42:49,431 --> 00:42:53,810
Let's just say somebody had the first
pure person as it slowly developed to see

1593
00:42:53,811 --> 00:42:57,290
through that somebody is going
to be the first guy to have that.

1594
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,470
If something like that would mutate
and happen and become a successful

1595
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:00,981
transition.

1596
00:43:00,981 --> 00:43:01,161
Yeah,

1597
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,390
someone would have to be the first,

1598
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:03,950
or at least have the first,

1599
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:04,191
you know,

1600
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:05,330
like stubs of it.

1601
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:06,110
Like you know,

1602
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,250
like some people are born with
like a little stub of a tail,

1603
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,263
you know?

1604
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:09,500
Yeah.

1605
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,101
What is that?

1606
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:10,880
The Pink Tab,

1607
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,200
but what,

1608
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,060
how come chimps don't have tails and
we're supposed to be related to chimps,

1609
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,760
to chimps ever get they ever
born with a little tail.

1610
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,900
Most of us don't have it though.

1611
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:18,381
No.

1612
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:19,400
Very few of us have it.

1613
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,890
I wonder if it's just a normal deformity.

1614
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,170
Just a normal slip of it's your brother's.

1615
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,730
Can anybody move it and then
tail that would be fucked.

1616
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,000
Imagine if you are a person you can wag
your tail to as a cat tail that would

1617
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:33,170
you even want to take it off?

1618
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,483
It's a cat tail.

1619
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:34,731
Yeah.

1620
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,440
You'd probably find some
weird pride out of it,

1621
00:43:36,441 --> 00:43:37,440
but it's like it's not

1622
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:39,710
because of it.

1623
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,610
Ah.

1624
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,391
You know what?

1625
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:42,530
If you could do that flying,

1626
00:43:42,531 --> 00:43:44,330
we'll end this shit like no problem.

1627
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:45,650
Cause you gotta kiss because of that.

1628
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,161
You know,

1629
00:43:46,161 --> 00:43:47,840
cats have the most ridiculous balance,

1630
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:48,380
man.

1631
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,140
I've tried to push cats
off of like banisters.

1632
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:52,820
I'm lucky enough that pastor
batch and the cats like,

1633
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:57,440
oh not all the way off like a weeble
wobble then right back slide sideways on a

1634
00:43:57,441 --> 00:43:58,274
banister.

1635
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:03,370
She see that video that chimp
versus the cat UFC match.

1636
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,100
No,

1637
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,000
it's bad ass.

1638
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,230
Google it sometime.

1639
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:07,064
It's great.

1640
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:07,641
It's a,

1641
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:10,520
it's a little monkey and a cat fighting
or they're really fighting or they

1642
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:10,851
playing.

1643
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:11,391
They're playing.

1644
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,270
But the cat has,

1645
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,330
some cats have really good Jujitsu.

1646
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,960
Oh they grew up around
chit chats or you know,

1647
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,281
we're,

1648
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,570
we're just comfortable with
them cause they're really tiny.

1649
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,630
They're all fearful in Israel.

1650
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,470
All cats.

1651
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,681
Yeah.

1652
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:26,900
They brought him in and nobody has
them as pets because they're so fucking

1653
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:27,470
disgusting.

1654
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:32,030
They brought them into to hunt rats and
they just switched yet then they right.

1655
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,060
No natural enemies.

1656
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,570
You guys should kill him off because
I bet you got toxo plasma like a

1657
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,840
motherfucker all out there just out
there dead when that side of the road or

1658
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:40,530
does everywhere.

1659
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:41,490
They're like a problem.

1660
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:43,740
Yeah.

1661
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,230
I don't like fake tough to,

1662
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,490
they're tough mean man.

1663
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,180
Feral cats or little moms.

1664
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,063
Oh Way.

1665
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:49,410
Yeah.

1666
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,430
They'll fuck you up dude.

1667
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:50,581
They'll,

1668
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:53,400
and they'll jump at you too if you,

1669
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:55,110
if you corner a feral cat man,

1670
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:59,220
be fucking can I can say or maybe I just
thought was just a normal cat and it

1671
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:00,054
was just crazy.

1672
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,220
Well feral cats or just wildcats.

1673
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,400
The,

1674
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,720
it's an amazing difference.

1675
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:04,230
The,

1676
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,063
the way they behave.

1677
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,130
Barn cats or you're talking about,

1678
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,710
I mean I'm sure farm cats
can be feral to cancer.

1679
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,600
Just retarded big.

1680
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,880
The guy straight up on walls so high.

1681
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:14,460
Like how are you going to get up there?

1682
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,270
Feral cats or feral kitten and I uh,

1683
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,180
they only will connect
themselves to one or two people.

1684
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,020
They were like,

1685
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:22,430
yeah,

1686
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:23,520
they really hate people.

1687
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:27,720
I was the only person that this cat could
like trust enough to pick up horses.

1688
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,471
And I could never,

1689
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:30,030
if he was something was wrong with him,

1690
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:31,140
I can never bring him to the vet.

1691
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,153
You couldn't,

1692
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,660
no one can take care of him but me,

1693
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,070
no one can even hold them at me.

1694
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:37,110
And I got him because a friend of mine,

1695
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:37,860
uh,

1696
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,311
she,

1697
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:38,490
uh,

1698
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:42,030
was living in this apartment building
and her and her boyfriend found them

1699
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:42,960
underneath the house.

1700
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:46,890
They found like a whole litter of kittens
and apparently the mother had died or

1701
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:49,590
something like that though it was
a wild cat and she gave birth.

1702
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:51,450
So they captured all the kittens.

1703
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,480
And uh,

1704
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,020
then they started trying
to find homes for them.

1705
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:54,330
And I said,

1706
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:54,551
ah,

1707
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:54,800
I can't,

1708
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,210
it's such a crazy story I got to take.

1709
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,050
So I took it and I,

1710
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:58,680
uh,

1711
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,680
I had to stay in a room with it for
two days because it was so crazy and so

1712
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:04,411
nuts,

1713
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:05,700
like to get a comfortable with me,

1714
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:07,440
I had to be like next to it for two days.

1715
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,110
So I just put a room in my house.

1716
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:10,541
Uh,

1717
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:11,730
I see my guest room,

1718
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,170
I put a litter box in there,

1719
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:16,700
put his cat food in there and
put a couple of notebooks and a,

1720
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,460
some books.

1721
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:17,810
Nope.

1722
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,180
I said,

1723
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:18,510
yeah,

1724
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:18,720
sorry,

1725
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,310
write shit down and uh,

1726
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,060
and then I'll,

1727
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:24,090
I'll do some reading and just hang out
with his fucking cat for a couple of days

1728
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,983
to get comfortable with you.

1729
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:25,261
Yeah.

1730
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:26,700
So that's what I did for two days.

1731
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:32,120
Every time I'd go near him he would
fucking climb up like there's curtains,

1732
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:36,060
climb up the curtains go
fucking crazy and I go,

1733
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:37,200
come download it buddy.

1734
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:38,034
Calm down,

1735
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,790
calm down.

1736
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:42,240
And then I touch him and then he would
start powering and par like really loud.

1737
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:43,820
He went from intuit check,

1738
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:48,870
fear and terror to like purring so loudly
are so happy that I'm actually taking

1739
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:49,734
care of him.

1740
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:50,820
He didn't know what's going on.

1741
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,220
He doesn't know why this big giant
pink thing turn it down toward much.

1742
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,920
Well I had to turn them into my buddy,

1743
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,960
but I was the only one that can touch him.

1744
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:00,030
Like even anywhere else was
supposed to get us wrong.

1745
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:00,930
And even me,

1746
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:02,280
I would like if I'd come up to him,

1747
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:06,120
like I had to take him to the vet once
and this is what a really bad time,

1748
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:06,361
man.

1749
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:07,181
It was fucking bad.

1750
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:08,640
This cat jacked my arm.

1751
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,300
I had to throw a towel
over them and tackle them.

1752
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:12,780
Really?

1753
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:13,210
Yeah.

1754
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:14,850
And was fierce fighting man.

1755
00:47:14,851 --> 00:47:18,350
He was fighting and then I brought him
to the vet and I told them that like,

1756
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:18,811
I go,

1757
00:47:18,811 --> 00:47:19,291
listen man,

1758
00:47:19,291 --> 00:47:20,041
this cat is feral.

1759
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:20,701
Like don't worry,

1760
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:22,180
we've had 25 years here.

1761
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:24,510
And we gave them that cat.

1762
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,980
And they said,

1763
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:28,130
well you weren't kidding
when you said he was fair.

1764
00:47:28,131 --> 00:47:28,440
I go,

1765
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:28,681
yeah,

1766
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:29,680
it's a feral cat man.

1767
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:29,861
Yeah.

1768
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:30,050
It was

1769
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:30,830
a cat.

1770
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:32,950
That cat is the craziest cat
we've ever had any of that go.

1771
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:33,610
Yeah.

1772
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:34,450
That's a wildcat.

1773
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,160
Big black crazy cat.

1774
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:37,363
Hmm

1775
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:37,730
me.

1776
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:39,170
I didn't in the army with the kittens.

1777
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,780
What they had to make them raise.

1778
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:42,410
Oh yeah.

1779
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:43,690
I wonder if will Ferrell,

1780
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,780
if every on you've got to listen
to the story that made him raised.

1781
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,630
My Dad was a special,

1782
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,560
a special,

1783
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:50,143
what was it called?

1784
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:51,950
The army special forces.

1785
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:52,700
Yeah.

1786
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,690
And up back then.

1787
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:54,883
And um,

1788
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,650
and what they do is they make you learn
how to take care of things you don't

1789
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,870
just so you can know how
to like care for your,

1790
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,700
your other gis or whatever.

1791
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:02,271
But uh,

1792
00:48:02,271 --> 00:48:03,480
so they give you a kitten just like the,

1793
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:07,310
they gave you that egg to care
for her and like a middle school,

1794
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,151
they'll give you a kid,

1795
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,020
you've got to raise it for,

1796
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:09,590
uh,

1797
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,820
for like two weeks or a month,

1798
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,320
I forgot.

1799
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:13,610
And you've got to make sure
nothing goes wrong with it.

1800
00:48:13,611 --> 00:48:14,421
If something goes wrong with it,

1801
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:15,021
if it gets sick,

1802
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:15,800
you're in trouble.

1803
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,421
You got to take care of it.

1804
00:48:16,421 --> 00:48:19,460
In addition to running all your laps
and doing everything and doing all your

1805
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:22,550
regular chores and a at the end of the
two weeks or to present this healthy

1806
00:48:22,551 --> 00:48:23,384
kitten.

1807
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,280
And then once you present
a healthy kid and they go,

1808
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:25,551
okay,

1809
00:48:25,551 --> 00:48:30,440
now snap his neck and they may get snapped
his neck right there so they can shut

1810
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:31,790
you off and turned it into a machine.

1811
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,303
Wow.

1812
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:35,420
After you've cared for it for two weeks.

1813
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:36,990
[inaudible]

1814
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:37,650
bare hands,

1815
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,150
not even like give it up for adoption.

1816
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:40,963
Fuck.

1817
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:42,803
What was,

1818
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,130
what was the story in the Bible where
God was telling someone to kill his son?

1819
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:48,053
Abraham?

1820
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:48,420
Why?

1821
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,190
What was the story behind those test

1822
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:52,980
to kill Isaac is a kill eyes.

1823
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,040
And uh,

1824
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:54,490
it was,

1825
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:54,930
it was,

1826
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:55,510
uh,

1827
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:57,880
was it not as firstborn
what size he was first born.

1828
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,183
Um,

1829
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:04,060
and then this is when those split off
happened between the Arabs and the Jews.

1830
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,020
It was right then.

1831
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,440
Really?

1832
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:05,890
Yeah.

1833
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:06,340
Why?

1834
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,460
Because Isaac's brother was
technically the first born,

1835
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,480
so he should have gotten the
birthright and the Jews say that he,

1836
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,400
he didn't,

1837
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,020
he went to Isaac and then Jacob.

1838
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:18,980
Okay.

1839
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,110
So God comes to Abraham,

1840
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:21,944
I want you to kill us.

1841
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:23,000
So he takes me to his mountain.

1842
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,030
Yeah.

1843
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,863
Take your son.

1844
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,190
It takes them to this mountain,

1845
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,360
puts them up on an altar.

1846
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,823
Um,

1847
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:29,400
yeah.

1848
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,233
And um,

1849
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:34,400
and then he goes to raise
a knife over his head and

1850
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:37,480
God sent a sign.

1851
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:38,560
He sent the ram,

1852
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,940
which is a normal thing.

1853
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:40,870
You sacrificed.

1854
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:42,700
He sent a ram right then.

1855
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,720
And that was a sign even though rams
were indigenous to that area at the time.

1856
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,820
It was definitely a sign from God,

1857
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,060
some retard God who couldn't
fucking get his full words out.

1858
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:56,170
So we just have to ramp and that obviously
means don't kill your son killed this

1859
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:59,950
ram instead of them blow the horn once
or twice a year cause that's so obvious.

1860
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:00,790
That's what it means.

1861
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,870
Cause he couldn't have just said,

1862
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:02,560
hey,

1863
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,140
don't kill your son and
that's a good enough sign.

1864
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:06,880
He had to send a ram to walk by

1865
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,530
such stupid idiots.

1866
00:50:10,531 --> 00:50:10,871
Shit.

1867
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:12,460
Once you realize what
you're getting older,

1868
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:16,720
you were a little kid and you got sent
to Israel to study this 10 12 hours a day

1869
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:17,554
like already did.

1870
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,230
I mean you'd probably be pretty passionate
about how are we supposed to take

1871
00:50:20,231 --> 00:50:20,891
that for granted?

1872
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:21,730
He sent a sign,

1873
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:22,780
it was a ram walk by.

1874
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:23,380
Oh yeah,

1875
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:23,951
that's a sign.

1876
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:25,530
Obviously crazy was easy.

1877
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,560
He was about to kill us,

1878
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:28,970
kill his son because God wanted him to.

1879
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:29,990
And then the issue became like,

1880
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:31,580
while we were still religious
with issue became like,

1881
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:32,870
well why would God command that?

1882
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,160
Why would that be a test for him?

1883
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,323
Why would you do it?

1884
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,070
And I just wanted to see,

1885
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:38,270
you knew if he was able to,

1886
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:38,961
but there was a test,

1887
00:50:38,961 --> 00:50:39,471
you're God,

1888
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:40,550
you knew it was going to be able to,

1889
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:42,770
so like why wouldn't you just say,

1890
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,041
okay,

1891
00:50:43,041 --> 00:50:43,281
go ahead.

1892
00:50:43,281 --> 00:50:43,840
You're up for it.

1893
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:48,840
You know you would know more than anybody
about how much of what you read when

1894
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,470
you were reading the Talmud,

1895
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,210
how much of what you've read had
been translated several times.

1896
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,910
How many times had it been
translated before it got to,

1897
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,520
when you read it in Modern Day Hebrew,

1898
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:03,890
how many times has it had been
transferred to get to that?

1899
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,580
No.

1900
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,170
Well it was,

1901
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:05,640
it's,

1902
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,060
it's the Torah is written exactly
the same as it always was.

1903
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:08,560
Oh wait.

1904
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:08,900
Yeah.

1905
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,460
So you read it in ancient Hebrew,

1906
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,170
even with the same shapes of the letters,

1907
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,170
he said the old testament
that's different.

1908
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:15,390
Yeah.

1909
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:19,700
Then this whole mode is that was handed
down orally for awhile and they were

1910
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,310
afraid it was gonna get lost
because of some dispersion.

1911
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:23,540
So they wrote it down.

1912
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,310
But the oldest versions of the Bible,

1913
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,330
of the ancient Hebrew versions,

1914
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:26,451
right,

1915
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:27,650
except for the Dead Sea Scrolls,

1916
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,720
which not technically
considered the Bible,

1917
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:31,760
even though some of the
stories are not 100% on those,

1918
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:32,400
right?

1919
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,330
So they said that the oldest
versions were in ancient Hebrew,

1920
00:51:35,331 --> 00:51:36,230
that they,

1921
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:38,990
the real problem was that they,

1922
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:41,510
when they translated
it to Greek and Latin,

1923
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:45,800
they said that they only knew like three
quarters of the words in ancient Hebrew

1924
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,320
this specific meetings to words,

1925
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:50,930
but they don't know all those because
some of those words didn't make it to

1926
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:51,764
modern Hebrew.

1927
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:53,630
And they don't really have
a good lineage to say like,

1928
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:53,890
where,

1929
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,100
where was this exact words?

1930
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:55,934
Like if I said,

1931
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:56,863
um,

1932
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:59,120
let's just say gently or lovingly,

1933
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:00,830
they could mean the same thing.

1934
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:02,960
It's certain times a gently said,

1935
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,070
whatever I lovingly said,

1936
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:04,904
it's simply similar,

1937
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,900
but there's differences.

1938
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,400
And that's what we have
two different words.

1939
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:09,230
When was this transition between ancient,

1940
00:52:09,231 --> 00:52:10,340
he ruined modern hero.

1941
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:14,000
Probably during the dispersion
we got cast out to all different,

1942
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:15,650
that's when we got white
juries and black jurors.

1943
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,870
After that one's went to the,

1944
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,770
what year was that?

1945
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,373
I don't know.

1946
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,760
And so so Israel or the Jews?

1947
00:52:24,761 --> 00:52:25,790
The the modern Jews.

1948
00:52:25,791 --> 00:52:28,880
They kept the certain
modern version of Hebrew.

1949
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:30,020
It was like 4,000 years ago.

1950
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:30,800
Probably something like that.

1951
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,270
But you guys also have numbers,

1952
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:33,410
which now they brought it back.

1953
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:34,770
They brought it back when they,

1954
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:36,360
when they went with them.

1955
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:37,760
Sort of a modern Hebrew I guess,

1956
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:40,310
but they just sort of made it when they
decided like what should our language

1957
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:40,441
back?

1958
00:52:40,441 --> 00:52:40,730
And they're like,

1959
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,110
let's bring the Hebrew
was a dead language.

1960
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,411
Oh,

1961
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:45,920
it was a dead language Korean
and all those people said,

1962
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:46,490
um,

1963
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:47,323
when was this?

1964
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,550
1948 47 holy shit.

1965
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,880
Hebrew was a dead language notice.

1966
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,081
Wow.

1967
00:52:54,081 --> 00:52:55,460
That's crazy number to speaking.

1968
00:52:55,461 --> 00:52:56,720
And there's some people that won't,

1969
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,730
that they're treated is like holy,

1970
00:52:58,731 --> 00:52:59,451
that's a little much.

1971
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:00,231
But the truth is holding,

1972
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:01,640
they won't speak at the only speak good.

1973
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:02,211
It's during the week.

1974
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,260
And then Shabbat,

1975
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,300
that's when he hit him with the Hebrew.

1976
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:06,140
What is she had it?

1977
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,590
What's a different or
weird bastardized mixture.

1978
00:53:09,591 --> 00:53:11,330
It's like southern talk creole.

1979
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:15,230
It's like not quite English cause the
mixture of Hebrew and like dramatic mixed

1980
00:53:15,231 --> 00:53:16,490
with whatever country you're from.

1981
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,220
When you talk to get you hard,

1982
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:22,130
there's no such things to get us to know
because I mean when it talks about its

1983
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:22,910
old.

1984
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:23,743
Oh really?

1985
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,950
The Jewish?

1986
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:25,430
Yeah,

1987
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:26,250
like nobody talks

1988
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,210
like that anymore.

1989
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:30,360
How much is different in
that and and modern Hebrew.

1990
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:31,650
Yiddish.

1991
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:32,850
It's mostly dramatic.

1992
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,630
German.

1993
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:38,630
So you most most kids understand it
like Israeli kids with the German kids,

1994
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:41,580
you better get it better.

1995
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,070
Really?

1996
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:42,390
Yeah.

1997
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:43,223
Wow.

1998
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,113
Yeah.

1999
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,380
God that's so incredible.

2000
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:48,660
When you stop and think about how
many different languages there are.

2001
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:49,981
Oh yeah.

2002
00:53:49,981 --> 00:53:53,490
They all developed somewhat similarly
in how long was it before they actually

2003
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:54,900
started writing shit down?

2004
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:58,230
How long did they have language before
they are actually wrote things down?

2005
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:01,320
Because I've waited a while
before they put signs to it.

2006
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,610
Probably tens of thousands.

2007
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:03,510
It didn't happen the other way.

2008
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:03,751
Yeah.

2009
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:07,050
I don't know how long the
first written language was,

2010
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:07,884
but I don't,

2011
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:10,080
I don't believe it was
more than 10,000 years ago.

2012
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,043
Yeah.

2013
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:12,780
Which is really like nothing.

2014
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,880
Here's kind of cranes.

2015
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:16,600
It's Kinda hurts your
head when he stopped.

2016
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,360
As long as we've been able to
communicate without being there.

2017
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,010
Stop and trying to put
your head around that.

2018
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,670
And the way,

2019
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:26,160
this is what I would
always use as an example,

2020
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,950
if I was in a crowd safe,

2021
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,210
I was doing a comedy show and there
was 100 people in the audience.

2022
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,660
I would say what you guys represent,

2023
00:54:33,661 --> 00:54:34,800
if you lived your lives,

2024
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:35,521
birth to death,

2025
00:54:35,521 --> 00:54:36,480
it's just a little room,

2026
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,860
a little tiny group of people,

2027
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:38,821
100 people.

2028
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:39,031
But,

2029
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:41,450
but what you represent in
terms of potential life,

2030
00:54:41,451 --> 00:54:41,941
his whole life,

2031
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:42,810
the next person was born.

2032
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,651
Exactly.

2033
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,700
If they lived there alone,

2034
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,211
their lives,

2035
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:46,050
birth to death,

2036
00:54:46,051 --> 00:54:46,651
to the Max,

2037
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:47,640
which is like a hundred years,

2038
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,290
which is the most anybody ever lives.

2039
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,840
They represent 10,000 years.

2040
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,600
That's as long as that's incredible.

2041
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,580
That's as long as we
know about human beings.

2042
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,090
Wow.

2043
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,850
But like 4,000 years ago
when we got the Bible around.

2044
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:00,251
That's right.

2045
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:00,870
Right.

2046
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:01,561
100 people.

2047
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:02,580
That's when not everyone was like better.

2048
00:55:02,581 --> 00:55:03,780
One lived a hundred years.

2049
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,900
It's not 10,000 a hundred
people living a hundred years.

2050
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,300
100 people living tennis
is a thousand yeah.

2051
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,173
Yeah.

2052
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,330
That's incredible man.

2053
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,650
Stop and think about that 10,000 years
ago and it's just a little tiny room full

2054
00:55:16,651 --> 00:55:17,430
of people living there.

2055
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,040
Last birth to death
represents the big fat long.

2056
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:24,300
The distance between us of
10 day and nothing written.

2057
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,550
I have three math jokes.

2058
00:55:26,551 --> 00:55:28,710
Yours is way better than
all three of those three.

2059
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:29,221
What jokes?

2060
00:55:29,221 --> 00:55:30,054
Math jokes.

2061
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,020
I Call Matt jokes where there's numbers
involved so they actually have to think

2062
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:34,854
before they laugh.

2063
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,540
That's not really a math joke,

2064
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,790
but it's a what the fuck thinking thing.

2065
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:39,990
It's like you want to check as math.

2066
00:55:39,991 --> 00:55:40,824
It takes her a second.

2067
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,890
I've been really getting into
game or game of Thrones first.

2068
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,140
Oh,

2069
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:46,920
it's amazing.

2070
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,330
It's the best show I've ever watched.

2071
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,890
I watched the whole for cause,

2072
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,720
but it's like I'd love that kind of Shit.

2073
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,291
I love that.

2074
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:56,150
Conan the barbarian type
swords and sorcery shit.

2075
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,750
I love that stuff.

2076
00:55:57,751 --> 00:55:58,584
I love it.

2077
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,081
So I'm,

2078
00:55:59,081 --> 00:56:00,390
I'm enjoying the fuck out of it.

2079
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,620
But it's making me think,

2080
00:56:01,621 --> 00:56:01,771
I mean,

2081
00:56:01,771 --> 00:56:03,330
although obviously this is a work of,

2082
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:03,601
you know,

2083
00:56:03,601 --> 00:56:04,740
fantasy fiction,

2084
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:06,990
it makes me think of what
it must've been like,

2085
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:07,350
you know,

2086
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:10,050
if you had to live like
these people lived,

2087
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,500
you know,

2088
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,940
with swords on horses.

2089
00:56:11,941 --> 00:56:15,120
I mean there was a time where
people actually lived like that.

2090
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,260
That is how they hunted.

2091
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:17,430
They used bows and arrows.

2092
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,870
They did live in these houses.

2093
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:22,050
They did have castles and they did
have armies and they did have moats.

2094
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:22,381
I mean,

2095
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,890
these are all realistic,

2096
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,140
realistic depictions of a certain time,

2097
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:29,351
you know,

2098
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:31,780
take away the sorcery and
all the other crazy stuff.

2099
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,070
There was people that in just a few
thousand years ago live like that.

2100
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:40,480
It's hard to wrap your head around how
short of a distance it is between that

2101
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:45,481
time when people lived like in the Robin
Hood days and today it's like nothing.

2102
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:45,840
You,

2103
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,540
it'd be cool though.

2104
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,280
It would still be cool having like,

2105
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:48,641
Hey,

2106
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:50,680
I got these new silver horse shoes.

2107
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:53,360
Have you seen these things
torsional or you know,

2108
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,140
even though you live back in those days,

2109
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:58,730
people were still making
new things up and like,

2110
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,910
but the things where like
differently they make up a new thing.

2111
00:57:00,911 --> 00:57:04,190
Every like red errors thing would come.

2112
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:06,280
I'm sure there was little
things here and there though.

2113
00:57:06,281 --> 00:57:07,240
Just like everything.

2114
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,080
Yeah,

2115
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,520
I'm sure there was a few intervention.

2116
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:10,540
It was so lame.

2117
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,070
Like well then they got
Chinese finger traps.

2118
00:57:12,071 --> 00:57:13,290
They were blown away by that.

2119
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,980
That does a party favor.

2120
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,230
But the Black Smith back
then was like the apple,

2121
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,060
like you would come in to
come look at this thing.

2122
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:19,410
I mean,

2123
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:19,641
you know,

2124
00:57:19,641 --> 00:57:21,310
this is a new layer of artisans.

2125
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,230
That's something that's
really getting lost.

2126
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,640
You know we talked about that
won't Aubrey was on here last,

2127
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:29,620
we talked about that Musashi documentary.

2128
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:31,750
No,

2129
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:32,500
it was a,

2130
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,920
they showed how they used to make Samurai
swords and there's a few people alive

2131
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:37,060
but still make them that way today.

2132
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:38,800
It's crazy.

2133
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:39,590
Some,

2134
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:42,280
I mean you have to be
the ultimate craftsmen.

2135
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:42,581
I mean,

2136
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:47,581
if you and I were left alone to figure
it out on our own for a million years,

2137
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:50,230
we'd never figured out how to
make a fucking Samurai sword.

2138
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,880
The way they do it is so incredible.

2139
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,350
They,

2140
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,590
they hammer it down,

2141
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:55,870
then they fold it over and
then they hammer it down.

2142
00:57:55,871 --> 00:57:58,940
Like they keep flattening it and hammering
it and flattening it and hammering

2143
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:04,060
until it becomes this intense steel that
you could just fucking slice through

2144
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,200
bamboo.

2145
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,190
It mean it's really amazing watching the,

2146
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,421
the,

2147
00:58:08,421 --> 00:58:08,810
the,

2148
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:10,090
the artisan work,

2149
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,620
the craftsmanship and the,

2150
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:15,490
the knowledge passed down
through generations and
generations of how to make a

2151
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:16,324
sword.

2152
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:16,721
You know,

2153
00:58:16,721 --> 00:58:17,760
when you stop and think about it,

2154
00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:22,030
it's like how many people are out there
in the world today that know how to make

2155
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,370
anything even remotely like that.

2156
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:28,450
Everything we're buying
that's manufactured is
manufactured in some sort of a

2157
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:28,841
factor.

2158
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,070
And if you're going to buy a sword,

2159
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:34,030
this is a big machine's going to cut it
and make it with a computer on a laser

2160
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:34,660
and shit.

2161
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:38,500
There's not going to be some Japanese
dude and flip flops with wooden bottom

2162
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:39,041
shoes.

2163
00:58:39,041 --> 00:58:39,874
Fucking wrong.

2164
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,150
It's wild to watch,

2165
00:58:43,151 --> 00:58:43,391
man.

2166
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:43,840
It's wild.

2167
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,010
It's wild to watch what people used
to have to do to make something,

2168
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:48,481
you know,

2169
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:48,650
it's,

2170
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,483
it really,

2171
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:53,400
really makes you appreciate
like how ridiculously easy,

2172
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,360
easy limiting us.

2173
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:55,050
Now people are like,

2174
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:55,930
I liked it better the other way.

2175
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:56,171
I'm like,

2176
00:58:56,171 --> 00:58:57,004
why?

2177
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,430
She's like,

2178
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,670
you just melt rocks,

2179
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:01,001
right?

2180
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:01,571
Or something like that.

2181
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:01,721
Yeah.

2182
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:05,080
You have to have a minor have
to in the rocks to make steel.

2183
00:59:05,081 --> 00:59:06,640
You have to add things to it too.

2184
00:59:06,641 --> 00:59:09,160
It's not just iron now to make steel,

2185
00:59:09,161 --> 00:59:09,941
I think you have to,

2186
00:59:09,941 --> 00:59:13,280
we should actually look that up and
like back in the back in the back in the

2187
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:13,290
day,

2188
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:13,520
say,

2189
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,081
what did they do?

2190
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:17,530
Just took some rocks and while
they have to heat things,

2191
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:18,790
eat them up.

2192
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:19,170
And they had a,

2193
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,710
they had a mind the metal.

2194
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:21,840
Yup.

2195
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,180
Okay.

2196
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:23,840
They have pockets of metal in the ground.

2197
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,540
They have to add stuff to,

2198
00:59:26,541 --> 00:59:26,960
uh,

2199
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,680
to the steel.

2200
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,580
They have to add stuff.

2201
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:29,100
Tired.

2202
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:29,930
It's combined.

2203
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:30,681
It's an alloy.

2204
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:35,540
Technically it says according to Wikipedia
made by combining iron and another

2205
00:59:35,570 --> 00:59:36,081
element,

2206
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:37,160
usually carbon.

2207
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:42,161
And when carbon is used it's content and
the steels between oh 0.2% and 2.1% by

2208
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:44,240
weight dependent upon the grade.

2209
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,890
Who figured that out?

2210
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,110
That was given to us.

2211
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,940
So I guess they had an ad shit.

2212
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,160
So it's like harder to
someone else was like,

2213
00:59:52,161 --> 00:59:53,050
why don't you add a carbon?

2214
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:53,751
And the first guy was like,

2215
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:54,890
what are you talking about?

2216
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,350
I mean that's been around
for a long ass time to,

2217
00:59:57,351 --> 01:00:00,280
so who was the first person that
somebody told somebody that's,

2218
01:00:00,281 --> 01:00:02,060
that doesn't seem like
that makes salience or no,

2219
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:05,180
you know what the crazy shit
in the world is steel cable.

2220
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:10,720
Who would have ever found some metal in
the ground and thought for a second that

2221
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:15,170
someone is going to take this
shit and have so much of it did.

2222
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:20,170
They're going to have a fucking 5,000
foot long cable made us steel and they're

2223
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:25,661
going to use that to suspend giant beams
that weighed several hundred tons over

2224
01:00:27,411 --> 01:00:28,244
an ocean.

2225
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,090
Did you leave like steel cable,

2226
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,250
steel cable is crazy.

2227
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:39,370
Someone figured out how to take metal
it out of the ground and stretch that

2228
01:00:40,251 --> 01:00:40,461
shit.

2229
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:41,420
It's hard.

2230
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,501
It's hard.

2231
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,900
How the fuck are you?

2232
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,200
How is it moving around?

2233
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:46,760
How are you making cables out of this?

2234
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:48,110
What did you do?

2235
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:52,040
They figured out how to not just make it
but make it so it's big enough to pull

2236
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:52,874
boats.

2237
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,440
You can have giant,

2238
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:55,700
huge ones that are there.

2239
01:00:55,701 --> 01:00:58,040
They're wider around in your body is,

2240
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,500
and that's a cable and we
just said take it for granted.

2241
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:04,130
Oh well I'm gonna just get a cable and
put a winch on the front of my jeep in

2242
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:05,560
case I get stuck out there.

2243
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,950
All four Waylon.

2244
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,870
You know people that have winches
and shit so they can pull cars out,

2245
01:01:09,871 --> 01:01:12,770
would be like to be the cool guy who
can pull you in an area that's still

2246
01:01:12,771 --> 01:01:13,760
capable of driving in the mud.

2247
01:01:13,761 --> 01:01:13,971
Yeah,

2248
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:15,140
that's fucking steel cable.

2249
01:01:15,141 --> 01:01:16,340
That winches steel cable.

2250
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:16,641
Man,

2251
01:01:16,641 --> 01:01:18,440
I get caught up and now she's
going to snap your arm off.

2252
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:19,581
Oh my God.

2253
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:19,791
Yeah.

2254
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:21,140
It'll rip your body apart.

2255
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:21,981
Steel cable.

2256
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:23,480
They can pick up trees with that shit.

2257
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:24,770
You gotta put a winch on.

2258
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:25,730
It depends on the pounds,

2259
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,200
the power of the winch.

2260
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,630
But if it's good winch can
pull hundreds of pounds.

2261
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,220
That's my black guys like it so much.

2262
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,050
I always hear him.

2263
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:32,570
What?

2264
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:34,010
Like taking it from buildings,

2265
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:35,173
stealing cables.

2266
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:35,591
Oh yeah.

2267
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,460
That's a little cable stealing you.

2268
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:40,100
Silly bitch though.

2269
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,720
Steel cable.

2270
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,310
Like you don't pay for it,

2271
01:01:43,311 --> 01:01:43,760
Brian.

2272
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,593
Oh,

2273
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:46,880
not like steel cables.

2274
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:51,950
Thinking about the first guy to invent
wires who figured out how to stretch out

2275
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:52,411
some metals.

2276
01:01:52,411 --> 01:01:53,570
So real heroes,

2277
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,780
like the first guy who actually steel
cable that somebody fucking figure that

2278
01:01:56,781 --> 01:01:58,490
out and then share that
information with people.

2279
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,730
I remember I used to have everybody
did who figured that out though?

2280
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,480
There was a guy that lives
in the neighborhood that
would leave up a thing when

2281
01:02:05,481 --> 01:02:07,160
satellite dishes first came out,

2282
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,730
he would leave up like on telephone poles.

2283
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:12,960
This is how the dumpster,

2284
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:16,610
it was in 1993 he leave up a
phone number and it would say,

2285
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:16,941
you know,

2286
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:19,770
fix your satellite box to catch any,

2287
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:20,783
any channel.

2288
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,030
And so you would give this guy
your card and then they would,

2289
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:24,360
uh,

2290
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:24,721
they would,

2291
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:25,081
he would,

2292
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:25,410
uh,

2293
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:29,190
he would come back and bring the card
back to you and it was doctored and the

2294
01:02:29,191 --> 01:02:30,360
card could get everything.

2295
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:31,950
I've got every paper view movie,

2296
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,240
every porn,

2297
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:33,901
every,

2298
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:34,170
you know,

2299
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:35,370
everything that happened it would get,

2300
01:02:35,371 --> 01:02:36,240
but it would never work.

2301
01:02:36,241 --> 01:02:37,080
It would really,

2302
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,490
it would work for like a
day is working with us.

2303
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,380
They would send a signal to fuck it up.

2304
01:02:41,381 --> 01:02:41,630
Yeah,

2305
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,930
they crush it and that,

2306
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:46,950
and then it just got to a silly point
where I think me and my roommate were

2307
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:47,131
like,

2308
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:48,080
why are we doing this?

2309
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,510
Pay For this?

2310
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:52,130
We want this stuff so we
can actually have a TV on.

2311
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,130
So stupid.

2312
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,200
You know,

2313
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,400
I saw at the bar,

2314
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:59,900
did I say how I saw at the barber shop
in Atlanta that the guys had hacked their

2315
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:04,550
Mac apple TV and it had
like every single channel,

2316
01:03:04,551 --> 01:03:05,420
Hbo,

2317
01:03:05,421 --> 01:03:07,640
every movie that was in theaters.

2318
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:08,510
It was just like,

2319
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:09,620
just like watch now,

2320
01:03:09,621 --> 01:03:10,131
watch now.

2321
01:03:10,131 --> 01:03:12,050
And it was set up so cool.

2322
01:03:12,051 --> 01:03:12,430
Like,

2323
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:14,150
I forgot all about it,

2324
01:03:14,151 --> 01:03:15,020
but whatever it is,

2325
01:03:15,021 --> 01:03:19,370
you can live off of the just that like
it had streaming channels had used during

2326
01:03:19,371 --> 01:03:19,761
channel.

2327
01:03:19,761 --> 01:03:20,594
It had,

2328
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,250
it had everything you could possibly want.

2329
01:03:22,251 --> 01:03:24,170
New Movies in theaters.

2330
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:25,870
Oh,

2331
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:27,220
I got a disturbing story for you.

2332
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,233
Oh,

2333
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:29,470
I remember wanting to Vancouver.

2334
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,453
Yes.

2335
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:31,151
And uh,

2336
01:03:31,151 --> 01:03:32,800
we went to visit that pot shop

2337
01:03:34,970 --> 01:03:37,630
but they couldn't sell to us
cause we're right out of state.

2338
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,400
But somebody hooked us up anyway.

2339
01:03:39,401 --> 01:03:40,510
He got fired for that,

2340
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,613
for hooking us up.

2341
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:42,870
Oh Man.

2342
01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:45,070
I got fired for it cause he
shouldn't have looked this up.

2343
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:46,450
Oh really?

2344
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,160
Yeah.

2345
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:47,993
It's so bad.

2346
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,421
Right.

2347
01:03:48,421 --> 01:03:48,751
It was like,

2348
01:03:48,751 --> 01:03:49,051
he was like,

2349
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:49,201
no,

2350
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:49,591
I can't help.

2351
01:03:49,591 --> 01:03:51,000
But then he went outside
and just gave us some,

2352
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:51,461
yeah,

2353
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:52,950
he couldn't sell us any.

2354
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:55,830
So he gave us some and you gave
them tickets to the UFC after that?

2355
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:56,431
Yeah.

2356
01:03:56,431 --> 01:03:57,031
What the fuck?

2357
01:03:57,031 --> 01:03:57,710
That guy got fired.

2358
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:58,081
Fired.

2359
01:03:58,081 --> 01:03:58,381
I was like,

2360
01:03:58,381 --> 01:03:58,471
oh,

2361
01:03:58,471 --> 01:03:59,430
this is the right way to handle it.

2362
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,890
Probably Brag too much about
the tickets for the EOC.

2363
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,460
They're reliable.

2364
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,390
I don't know.

2365
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,270
I dead sucks though.

2366
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:07,440
Sorry to hear about that buddy.

2367
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:07,810
I was like,

2368
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:08,830
aw man.

2369
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,390
I was like,

2370
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,590
that's a real really bad for you.

2371
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:14,280
Some day it's going to be easy to
go anywhere and be able to buy.

2372
01:04:14,281 --> 01:04:17,340
We just so I can go anywhere
and buy a beer how it should be.

2373
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:22,370
You should be a fucking tax paying grown
adult who walks in there and act like a

2374
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,720
gentleman and picks up
whatever the fuck you need.

2375
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,470
Whether you would like to buy a bottle
of wine to go with dinner or that you'd

2376
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:30,930
like to get an eighth of
weed cause you and you check.

2377
01:04:30,931 --> 01:04:32,340
You're going to watch movies and fuck.

2378
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,031
How about that?

2379
01:04:33,031 --> 01:04:33,661
Is that okay?

2380
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:34,740
Am I allowed to do that?

2381
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:39,270
You fucking controlling duty by the
counter purchase to go there with the key.

2382
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:39,570
Yeah.

2383
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:40,530
She'd be super easy.

2384
01:04:40,531 --> 01:04:41,370
Here's your Id.

2385
01:04:41,371 --> 01:04:42,150
Can I see your id?

2386
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,421
Okay.

2387
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:43,650
You're 21 here's your weed.

2388
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:45,390
Mr. Should fear take it easy.

2389
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:48,510
21 snots sense bitch.

2390
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:49,493
No,

2391
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:49,950
no,

2392
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:54,810
not for weed has been 21 I don't think
it should be for which bill to get them

2393
01:04:54,811 --> 01:04:54,990
high.

2394
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:55,650
Really Young.

2395
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,120
I took half an Adderall today.

2396
01:04:57,121 --> 01:04:59,340
This is like the second time
I've ever done Adderall before.

2397
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:02,970
This is the first time
that I feel like it.

2398
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:04,440
It's like a sativa.

2399
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,810
I think if you are a fan of Adderall,

2400
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,840
if you've got a really good sativa,

2401
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:11,340
it'd be pretty similar.

2402
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,780
So I think so.

2403
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:13,360
What's your

2404
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,770
body all jacked up and moving?

2405
01:05:14,771 --> 01:05:16,270
It's similar in some way,

2406
01:05:16,271 --> 01:05:17,104
but here's the deal Brian.

2407
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:17,980
When you say half an

2408
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,760
Adderall,

2409
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:22,450
you have to understand there are
different values for different pills.

2410
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:22,760
Yeah,

2411
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,860
I slept five milligram Adderall is far
different than the 40 that you might've

2412
01:05:26,861 --> 01:05:27,694
had split in half,

2413
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:28,781
by the way.

2414
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:30,370
Powerful Ari Shaffir tee shirts.

2415
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,450
These are awesome watching on each gene.

2416
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:36,400
You guys didn't have to wear them
while I was here to look at his tongue.

2417
01:05:36,401 --> 01:05:37,270
It's got some stuff.

2418
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,800
Where can anybody by these dudes,

2419
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:41,110
these are actually really cool to have
them online and like a week or two,

2420
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,250
but right now my live dates nice.

2421
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,970
Well we pester Ari on on Twitter,

2422
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:46,451
a,

2423
01:05:46,451 --> 01:05:47,350
r I.

2424
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:47,351
S,

2425
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:47,651
h,

2426
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:47,921
a,

2427
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:48,160
F,

2428
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:48,430
m,

2429
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:48,970
I.

2430
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:49,360
R,

2431
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:54,360
to make sure that he comes on strong
and LSD and ecstasy on his tongue.

2432
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,200
And there's the pink elephants on parade.

2433
01:05:58,140 --> 01:05:59,740
There's a hard bitch on your head.

2434
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:02,340
Login like a black shirt with a
mushroom leaf right next to it.

2435
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,251
There's only one place.

2436
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,150
I can't wear this shirt though,

2437
01:06:04,151 --> 01:06:05,950
like comedy club to be kind of weird.

2438
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:07,130
Where it bitch,

2439
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:09,400
somebody scared I wear,

2440
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:10,480
and I'll wear this on stage.

2441
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:11,230
If I'd know.

2442
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,190
If I knew that you had this,

2443
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:13,420
I would've wore this for my special.

2444
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:14,260
Yeah.

2445
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:14,610
Really?

2446
01:06:14,610 --> 01:06:14,990
Yeah.

2447
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:15,823
That'd be a cool shirt.

2448
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:17,290
I want to totally wore
this for my special.

2449
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:18,551
How about this?

2450
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:22,020
I'll wear this for my next special
committing to it and I was writing it out.

2451
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:22,630
There'll be gone.

2452
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:22,911
Does this,

2453
01:06:22,911 --> 01:06:23,800
it's 2012 shirt.

2454
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,230
I want to have a different
story where this next year.

2455
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,310
Oh yeah.

2456
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,630
My goal now we're going to do it.

2457
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,630
You're gonna try to do I have to do in
Atlanta is to try to do another one in a

2458
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:31,690
year.

2459
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:31,780
Yeah,

2460
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:32,613
let's talk about that.

2461
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:33,803
Do.

2462
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,770
Let's hear some new jokes every year.

2463
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:37,090
It's like some notes of yours right now.

2464
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:37,241
Oh,

2465
01:06:37,241 --> 01:06:38,110
I can't tell you

2466
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,710
like here's the program
really helped me when,

2467
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,690
when you're thinking in terms of this
with Thompson grower as bill bitter about

2468
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:48,820
it and he broke it down to
what an hours and he goes,

2469
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,050
that's five minutes a month.

2470
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:53,830
So if you get pretty much any
new month that you're like,

2471
01:06:53,831 --> 01:06:55,270
am I in five minutes ahead of where I was?

2472
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:58,110
And just time it that way and just keep
a pace for yourself where you're at the

2473
01:06:58,111 --> 01:06:59,350
head of pace or behind pace.

2474
01:06:59,370 --> 01:07:02,420
I had five new minutes the
first time on stage because I,

2475
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:04,360
there was a bunch of shit
that I had written that I,

2476
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,590
the last couple of months I
hadn't committed to any new stuff.

2477
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,690
I was just trying to just completely
tighten the old stuff except this

2478
01:07:11,691 --> 01:07:13,510
circumcision beard that
just came out of nowhere.

2479
01:07:13,511 --> 01:07:14,350
I couldn't stop it.

2480
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:15,600
I had to put it on and it will,

2481
01:07:15,601 --> 01:07:17,440
it just fit in with all
this other shit I had to.

2482
01:07:17,650 --> 01:07:18,520
But other than that,

2483
01:07:18,970 --> 01:07:22,540
oh my writing that I had from
all that time is all bank rolled.

2484
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:24,760
So I just have to go over the writing.

2485
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:30,090
You know the fucking just nuttiness I
just have to go over there cause you're

2486
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:30,761
like,

2487
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:31,600
I've got stuff right now.

2488
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,440
So since I did still keep writing I,

2489
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:36,610
there's a lot of ideas.

2490
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:38,470
I just have to sort of set them out.

2491
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:40,060
But this will make
yourself go through him.

2492
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,350
Did you end up doing the baby?

2493
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:42,041
No.

2494
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:42,161
No,

2495
01:07:42,161 --> 01:07:42,994
I didn't do that one.

2496
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:43,540
No,

2497
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:44,550
that's two specials.

2498
01:07:44,551 --> 01:07:45,220
A dumb joke.

2499
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:46,053
It's going to be like,

2500
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:47,460
no,

2501
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:47,561
no,

2502
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:47,711
no,

2503
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:47,951
no.

2504
01:07:47,951 --> 01:07:48,850
I had a thought I hadn't thought.

2505
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:49,650
Here's what you do.

2506
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:50,151
What you do.

2507
01:07:50,151 --> 01:07:52,060
A video just really excites me to video.

2508
01:07:52,390 --> 01:07:54,070
I should get it out there
on your own youtube account.

2509
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:54,311
Yeah.

2510
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:55,080
Hire some actors.

2511
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,030
I mean that bit tray.

2512
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,520
That bit is three or four years
old and so ready to go and be done.

2513
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:01,650
Have done Barris be the baby.

2514
01:08:01,651 --> 01:08:02,110
Yeah,

2515
01:08:02,110 --> 01:08:02,351
it's,

2516
01:08:02,351 --> 01:08:02,771
I have,

2517
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:06,400
I'm so immature with my sense of humor
that has so many jokes about someone

2518
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:07,234
getting blown.

2519
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,060
Just actually use that to promote
the special when you have it.

2520
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:12,490
Here's one for the next
time you go to a big club,

2521
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:14,320
just tape it Brian fucking
tape from the back.

2522
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:16,070
Maybe behind and you get a close up

2523
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:18,410
of him and get a far away shot
of him and cut those together.

2524
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,273
I'll go behind you.

2525
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:20,540
Well,

2526
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:20,751
no,

2527
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:21,584
not behind

2528
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:25,550
caustically Adderall.

2529
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:26,090
Um,

2530
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,481
but it was,

2531
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:26,820
uh,

2532
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,100
it was the Atlanta thing.

2533
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:28,934
Couldn't it went great.

2534
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:30,051
Couldn't have gone any better.

2535
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:30,650
Man.

2536
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,630
These crowds are completely
different crowds.

2537
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:37,400
The crowds that we're getting now
are 100% podcast fans and it's like,

2538
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,190
it's like hanging out and doing
a show in front of our friends.

2539
01:08:40,191 --> 01:08:42,090
It's like a bunch of friends
that we don't know that one.

2540
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,330
The other people who come
just to come for shows,

2541
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:44,750
they're like,

2542
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:44,871
oh,

2543
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:45,940
this is a really fun thing.

2544
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:48,980
Do are so overwhelmingly nice.

2545
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:49,240
It's,

2546
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,061
it's crazy.

2547
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:50,600
It's,

2548
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,770
I don't know how we did it.

2549
01:08:51,771 --> 01:08:52,541
I don't know what,

2550
01:08:52,541 --> 01:08:54,140
what exact the cottle exactly.

2551
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:56,390
The combination was to create that,

2552
01:08:56,391 --> 01:08:57,710
but that's very unusual.

2553
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,950
It's very unusual when you talk to
people that work at clubs and people that

2554
01:09:00,951 --> 01:09:01,784
work at theaters,

2555
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:04,100
they go your crowds and nicest
crowd we've ever seen ever.

2556
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:04,921
Pretty cool.

2557
01:09:04,921 --> 01:09:05,630
It's even close.

2558
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:06,410
The good tippers.

2559
01:09:06,410 --> 01:09:06,800
They're good.

2560
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,130
They're generous and they were
fucking so pumped for the show.

2561
01:09:10,131 --> 01:09:10,401
Dude.

2562
01:09:10,401 --> 01:09:11,234
It was nuts.

2563
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:12,610
I was so comfortable.

2564
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:16,040
It's the only time I've ever done a
special where I didn't feel at all like,

2565
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,671
Oh shit,

2566
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,720
I'm filming right now.

2567
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,090
Or it was completely in the groove.

2568
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,850
I had done so much standup
leading up to that too.

2569
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,810
So yeah,

2570
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:26,150
I did all my work and then on top of that,

2571
01:09:26,151 --> 01:09:27,230
the crowd was amazing,

2572
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,000
but now it's that.

2573
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:31,880
The big challenge is to now
to create a whole new hour,

2574
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,250
so I have to really sit down and
I have all these scattered notes.

2575
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:38,360
I'm going to have to do
some organizing isis,

2576
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:39,050
isis,

2577
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,400
we're going to do some ice house shows.

2578
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,050
Can we do Wednesday?

2579
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:43,223
See if we could do Wednesday?

2580
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:45,710
Probably not.

2581
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:46,543
Probably not.

2582
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:47,120
If we can,

2583
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:47,570
let's do it.

2584
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:49,340
This is what Louis said to
after you do the first year,

2585
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,530
when you start the same
process again the next year,

2586
01:09:51,531 --> 01:09:53,270
and it seems as daunting
as it does right now,

2587
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:53,870
you'd be like,

2588
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:54,081
oh no,

2589
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:55,730
I know this leads to a
new hour of material.

2590
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:56,390
Yeah,

2591
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,111
so it's okay,

2592
01:09:57,111 --> 01:09:57,770
I can do this.

2593
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,030
It's a bench pressing to get bigger.

2594
01:09:59,060 --> 01:09:59,451
Well,

2595
01:09:59,451 --> 01:10:02,330
I know that writing to me is just like,

2596
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:07,740
it's like doing rounds on the bag or
doing minutes on an elliptical machine.

2597
01:10:07,821 --> 01:10:08,690
You build endurance,

2598
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:12,920
you build like a groove and right now
you know I'm in good writing shape.

2599
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:13,401
You know?

2600
01:10:13,401 --> 01:10:14,001
I felt like when I,

2601
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:18,110
when I write a lot I get in a good
way it's a muscle and now I can,

2602
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,970
I think it comes,

2603
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:23,250
it comes out better the more you
use it and it comes out your,

2604
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:25,780
your editing skills on the fly get better.

2605
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:27,260
Better right now than
you were five years ago.

2606
01:10:27,261 --> 01:10:28,000
20 years ago.

2607
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,560
No.

2608
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:29,393
Yeah.

2609
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:31,200
I'm so happy that I,

2610
01:10:31,201 --> 01:10:31,491
you know,

2611
01:10:31,491 --> 01:10:33,710
I always wondered what
would happen as I got older.

2612
01:10:33,711 --> 01:10:34,511
Like if my standup,

2613
01:10:34,511 --> 01:10:35,660
it starts to suck one day.

2614
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:36,291
You know,

2615
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:37,580
I always worried about that.

2616
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:41,150
I always worried about like hitting a
peak and then not being good anymore.

2617
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:42,690
It seems like there's
a plateau you can get.

2618
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:46,280
It's like Kinda like pool where you
can play later through stand up later

2619
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,060
interiors.

2620
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:48,620
It's not like a 40 year
old retirement moment.

2621
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:49,010
Yeah.

2622
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,281
Well,

2623
01:10:49,281 --> 01:10:51,230
I think it has to do with
your physical health too.

2624
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:51,520
You know,

2625
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,270
if you get depressed
and you feel like shit,

2626
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,540
I bet your comedy is going to start
to not be as fun and not be as good.

2627
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:58,540
I think part of the commitments,

2628
01:10:59,540 --> 01:10:59,691
well,

2629
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:01,350
he's different kinds of standup,

2630
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:01,650
you know,

2631
01:11:01,650 --> 01:11:02,483
standups.

2632
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,490
Comedy almost depends
on him being miserable.

2633
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:05,950
I think every,

2634
01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:07,520
like almost every comic I know.

2635
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:09,170
It seems like they're
depressed and miserable.

2636
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:11,090
They don't have to be,

2637
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:12,291
it's not necessarily,

2638
01:11:12,291 --> 01:11:13,800
but that can fuel you.

2639
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,171
You know?

2640
01:11:14,171 --> 01:11:16,050
It can fuel you to go up
there and get that charge.

2641
01:11:16,051 --> 01:11:18,960
Where I know in times of my
life where I wasn't happy,

2642
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:20,220
I would go on stage and kill it.

2643
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:21,630
At least feel like I can do something.

2644
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:22,710
Yeah.

2645
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:25,620
It will at least feel like
I'm capable of something.

2646
01:11:25,621 --> 01:11:26,790
Like if I could go on stage,

2647
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:27,061
you know,

2648
01:11:27,061 --> 01:11:28,170
from feeling like a loser,

2649
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:29,430
I'm feeling depressed.

2650
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,500
I go on stage and get a
bunch of people to laugh.

2651
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:32,100
I'll decide,

2652
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:32,341
okay,

2653
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:32,591
I'm not,

2654
01:11:32,591 --> 01:11:33,510
I'm not bad at this.

2655
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,890
I did a good job with this.

2656
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:35,181
I go,

2657
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:35,490
yeah,

2658
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:36,750
I can feel a little better now.

2659
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,970
A little pick me up short term.

2660
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:42,000
So they all give you a standing
ovation before you even went on stage.

2661
01:11:42,001 --> 01:11:42,630
I was nuts.

2662
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:42,811
It was,

2663
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:43,644
couldn't have been better,

2664
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,840
couldn't not have been better.

2665
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:49,560
And there was a lot of traffic because
there were some crazy basketball games

2666
01:11:49,561 --> 01:11:50,520
going on at the same time.

2667
01:11:50,521 --> 01:11:51,060
And yeah,

2668
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:51,421
we,

2669
01:11:51,421 --> 01:11:51,840
um,

2670
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,950
we've got stuck.

2671
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:53,520
Like there was,

2672
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,200
it was really hard for
everybody to get there.

2673
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:57,870
So the show didn't even start
for like a half an hour late.

2674
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:59,490
So like everybody was building up.

2675
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:01,350
So when the lights went off and when,

2676
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:01,650
you know,

2677
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,750
I came on the microphone
to introduce Joey,

2678
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,060
they went fucking crazy.

2679
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,620
It was so funny because,

2680
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:08,400
um,

2681
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,170
my manager and uh,

2682
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,410
you know,

2683
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,460
Shandra and Jeff there,

2684
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:12,313
they're the best.

2685
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:15,060
I've been with Jeff since I
was an open miker essentially.

2686
01:12:15,061 --> 01:12:17,940
Like he came and found me in
Boston when I was a scrub.

2687
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,900
And I think that one of the main reasons
why I've been successful is that I

2688
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:23,550
don't have to think
about the business stuff.

2689
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:24,680
I just let him think about it.

2690
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:26,520
And I just to do my comedy.

2691
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:29,340
I don't have to worry about
it cause cause he's the best.

2692
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:30,960
But they were like,

2693
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,093
let's Ah,

2694
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,320
have you introduced offstage?

2695
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:37,020
Like just say your name
clean and you come out alone.

2696
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:37,854
I'm like,

2697
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:38,700
no,

2698
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,690
she always got to bring me up.

2699
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,480
What's your fans will
want to see that too.

2700
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:42,983
Five seconds.

2701
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,750
Joey has to bring me up this.

2702
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:45,200
That's,

2703
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,500
that's the Voodoo.

2704
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,030
Thank you for the suggestion.

2705
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:48,661
We're not going to do that.

2706
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:49,530
I appreciate your input,

2707
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:50,340
but we're not.

2708
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:50,881
But they were like,

2709
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:52,040
well let's just try it once.

2710
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:52,410
I'm like,

2711
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:52,860
nope,

2712
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:53,850
Joey's going to bring me up.

2713
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:54,421
This is just,

2714
01:12:54,421 --> 01:12:55,890
it doesn't have to make sense.

2715
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:58,050
It's just Joe is a
product to talk about it.

2716
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:01,980
It's brought me up and every
special for the past eight,

2717
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:02,731
nine years,

2718
01:13:02,731 --> 01:13:03,564
whatever it's been.

2719
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,710
So they couldn't do it in Canada,

2720
01:13:04,711 --> 01:13:05,040
right?

2721
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:05,161
Yeah.

2722
01:13:05,161 --> 01:13:07,770
Dunkin and I tried to do a chant at
the beginning of one of the specialist,

2723
01:13:07,771 --> 01:13:08,820
but it didn't work at all.

2724
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,453
So

2725
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,143
yeah,

2726
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,700
we were way too begged for,

2727
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:18,600
we came up with that idea.

2728
01:13:18,601 --> 01:13:18,921
We talked,

2729
01:13:18,921 --> 01:13:19,810
we'd get the whole crowd,

2730
01:13:19,811 --> 01:13:23,940
the to Oma long and we got like maybe
30 people and then everyone's like,

2731
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:24,630
what's happening?

2732
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:25,390
What are you doing?

2733
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:26,480
They were waiting for the punchline.

2734
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:27,160
That never was,

2735
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:28,510
that shit is such a trip.

2736
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:31,660
The second show Joe turned to me and goes,

2737
01:13:31,661 --> 01:13:33,310
do you want to go up and do five minutes?

2738
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:37,180
And we just got done smoking a joint
and I was stoned out of my mind.

2739
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:42,280
I like that was I got to go up and it
was pretty cool but it was still hard to

2740
01:13:42,281 --> 01:13:43,930
judge that many people like,

2741
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:44,260
like,

2742
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:44,741
like you said,

2743
01:13:44,741 --> 01:13:46,660
30 people was doing it and it seemed like,

2744
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:46,841
you know,

2745
01:13:46,841 --> 01:13:48,160
it's 30 out of a million.

2746
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:50,900
I don't want to say your material dude,

2747
01:13:50,901 --> 01:13:53,360
but the one joke you
have is fucking funny.

2748
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:54,680
He's got one joke.

2749
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:55,873
I just,

2750
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:56,450
I,

2751
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:58,110
I can't say anything that'll give away.

2752
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,690
It's one jug.

2753
01:13:59,690 --> 01:14:00,980
That's one of them where I go,

2754
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:01,461
damn,

2755
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:02,690
I wish I thought that one up.

2756
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,820
You know when you hear
somebody say something and
just like fires off the door,

2757
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:08,060
that's a fun one to play with.

2758
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,071
So much to do.

2759
01:14:09,071 --> 01:14:11,800
And watch over a thousand
people laugh at was really fun.

2760
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:15,210
It's fun to watch someone go up
that's never been in front of that,

2761
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:16,510
that big of a crowd.

2762
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:18,010
But they all were really friendly.

2763
01:14:18,011 --> 01:14:19,060
Like when you went on stage,

2764
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:20,560
they give you a huge round of applause.

2765
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,840
I know you're probably so
then had a made you feel like,

2766
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:23,110
you know,

2767
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:23,710
they weren't,

2768
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:23,981
they were,

2769
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:26,380
they were happy to see it so much better.

2770
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:26,860
Yeah.

2771
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:29,350
Feeling so much better than the
feeling you get when it's like,

2772
01:14:29,410 --> 01:14:29,741
oh cool,

2773
01:14:29,741 --> 01:14:30,520
you guys already know me.

2774
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:32,500
Nobody takes more
Internet shit than Brian.

2775
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,330
Nobody takes more.

2776
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:34,810
There's,

2777
01:14:34,810 --> 01:14:37,600
you have more haters and more irrational,

2778
01:14:37,690 --> 01:14:39,460
angry people who love it though.

2779
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:39,731
Right?

2780
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,564
A certain party.

2781
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,260
No,

2782
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:41,501
no,

2783
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:41,621
no.

2784
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:42,490
It's not comfortable.

2785
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:48,170
And then there's always some weird
sort of analysis of Brian and I's

2786
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:49,084
relationship.

2787
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:50,523
Look,

2788
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:52,060
Brian and I are very different,

2789
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:54,010
but obviously we like each other.

2790
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:54,700
You know,

2791
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,010
never had a job for more than 10 10 years

2792
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,500
is a long time.

2793
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:00,334
We were going to go along.

2794
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,680
But we like each other.

2795
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,071
I mean,

2796
01:15:03,071 --> 01:15:04,150
we liked each other a lot.

2797
01:15:04,151 --> 01:15:04,280
We're,

2798
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:04,511
I mean,

2799
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:05,141
I would say love,

2800
01:15:05,141 --> 01:15:06,850
but it sounds gay because
he's right next to me.

2801
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:07,990
But of course I love him.

2802
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,693
We,

2803
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,870
the reason why we've been,

2804
01:15:10,871 --> 01:15:13,150
we keep doing this is
because it works well,

2805
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,080
don't you say?

2806
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:14,560
Yeah,

2807
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,730
he says ridiculous shit.

2808
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,211
Yeah,

2809
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:16,721
he thinks it.

2810
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,390
But you say also some things
that I don't think of.

2811
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:20,020
You know,

2812
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:20,290
you're,

2813
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:23,350
you come at things from a
weird perspective sometimes,

2814
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:24,663
you know,

2815
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:25,900
but for whatever reason,

2816
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:26,530
people,

2817
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,060
people get angry at shit.

2818
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:29,340
That man,

2819
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:31,690
all you have to do is take one thing.

2820
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:36,130
You'll interject one thing and it will
derail a conversation and sometimes it

2821
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:39,040
works and sometimes you derail something
and it becomes really funny and

2822
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:39,641
sometimes it doesn't.

2823
01:15:39,641 --> 01:15:39,940
I mean,

2824
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:40,600
who knows?

2825
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,650
You never know until you try.

2826
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,180
That's what people don't
understand that listening.

2827
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:47,020
But they'll get so fucking
angry at you and you're like,

2828
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:47,440
dude,

2829
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,480
get up and go out to,

2830
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:51,670
there's a conversation going on
somewhere and you're listening in.

2831
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:52,533
That's it.

2832
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,590
That's all that's happening here.

2833
01:15:53,591 --> 01:15:56,380
There's no reason to get
fucking spastic angry,

2834
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:57,400
fucking violent.

2835
01:15:57,401 --> 01:15:57,800
Mad,

2836
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,020
like relaxed.

2837
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,410
If you interrupt one more time,

2838
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:03,740
I'm going to kick him in his guns.

2839
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:05,320
That's the only way you've expressed like,

2840
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:06,100
oh,

2841
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,090
that's all they're trying to express.

2842
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:08,500
That's the only way
they can do that online.

2843
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,600
That's all they feel is.

2844
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:12,730
So I have to say that
I'm going to kill you.

2845
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:14,080
I appreciate criticism.

2846
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:14,711
I really do.

2847
01:16:14,711 --> 01:16:15,760
And it sounds like I don't,

2848
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:19,840
cause I just get mad and blocked people
when they say coffee things on Twitter

2849
01:16:19,841 --> 01:16:20,530
or whatever.

2850
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:21,520
But I'm not gonna argue with you,

2851
01:16:21,521 --> 01:16:21,880
man.

2852
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,340
If you can't communicate with
me like a normal human being,

2853
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:26,770
if you can't communicate with
me like you would if you just,

2854
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,990
I don't care who I ever met.

2855
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:30,000
If,

2856
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:30,520
if I,

2857
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,300
if I had to have a
conversation with Adolf Hitler,

2858
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:34,661
okay.

2859
01:16:34,661 --> 01:16:38,350
If I had to go back in time and have
a conversation with Adolph Hitler,

2860
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:42,070
I wouldn't start calling them a comment
and say crazy stupid shit to him.

2861
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:44,320
Even though I know he's a piece of shit,

2862
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:45,330
I don't got anything.

2863
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:46,163
So where's that going to help you?

2864
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,230
It's not going to help me at all.

2865
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:48,370
I already know what he has.

2866
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,180
I want to base all of my interactions
with someone and how they interact with

2867
01:16:52,181 --> 01:16:52,391
me,

2868
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:54,850
not how I want to know about their past.

2869
01:16:54,851 --> 01:16:55,151
I want to,

2870
01:16:55,151 --> 01:16:55,391
you know,

2871
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:57,580
I want to know you're dealing with a
criminal or whatever the fuck you're

2872
01:16:57,581 --> 01:16:58,031
dealing with,

2873
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:03,031
but you should be as as yeses as possible
to someone I find always gets upset

2874
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:05,050
when people like writing shitty things.

2875
01:17:05,051 --> 01:17:05,470
I'm like,

2876
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:06,011
why do you care?

2877
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:07,240
That's just some shitty person.

2878
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,171
Who Cares?

2879
01:17:08,171 --> 01:17:10,190
That's just a screaming baby he gets,

2880
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:11,740
he gets Cody worried about.

2881
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:12,290
Yeah.

2882
01:17:12,290 --> 01:17:15,440
I see people go back and forth and
fight with people on Twitter and like,

2883
01:17:15,441 --> 01:17:15,801
Whoa,

2884
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:16,251
really?

2885
01:17:16,251 --> 01:17:16,470
Yes.

2886
01:17:16,470 --> 01:17:16,761
It was like,

2887
01:17:16,761 --> 01:17:17,151
fuck you.

2888
01:17:17,151 --> 01:17:17,860
You fucking cunt.

2889
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,220
I call Dana White goes,

2890
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:19,730
wow,

2891
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:21,740
Dana white has like multiple day.

2892
01:17:21,810 --> 01:17:22,460
Really?

2893
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:23,330
We can't do that.

2894
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:23,961
There's no point.

2895
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:24,411
What do you like?

2896
01:17:24,411 --> 01:17:26,480
What are you going to prove
to them that they're wrong?

2897
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:29,900
Has that ever happened to their history
of Twitter data to prove to someone that

2898
01:17:29,901 --> 01:17:30,500
they're wrong?

2899
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,790
Dana actually enjoys it though.

2900
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,740
Really does a great boss Boston.

2901
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:34,610
He still likes to fight.

2902
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:35,523
He still needs it.

2903
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:36,860
He enjoys it.

2904
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:37,761
He's good at it.

2905
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:42,761
He goes to their fucking pictures and
makes a lot of all the pictures and yeah,

2906
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:43,461
it's,

2907
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:44,061
it's funny,

2908
01:17:44,061 --> 01:17:44,361
man.

2909
01:17:44,361 --> 01:17:45,380
It's funny he gets into it,

2910
01:17:45,381 --> 01:17:47,090
but he does it all with
a big smile on his face.

2911
01:17:47,091 --> 01:17:48,020
I've watched them do it,

2912
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:48,530
you know,

2913
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:51,320
he's not like mean obviously Dana
White and successful as fuck.

2914
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:55,880
He's not really worried about what some
twatty 15 year old kid from the middle

2915
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:57,520
of nowhere on Twitter is saying about it.

2916
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:58,790
He thinks it's fun.

2917
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,170
20 as good words.

2918
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:01,004
Flighty.

2919
01:18:02,330 --> 01:18:03,163
It's a sweet word.

2920
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:03,870
And by the way though,

2921
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:04,790
people that came to Joe Shaw,

2922
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:08,390
I want you to come to my show
May 12th where's your show?

2923
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:08,900
Oh,

2924
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:09,291
I'm sorry.

2925
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:09,710
Denver.

2926
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:09,871
Yeah,

2927
01:18:09,871 --> 01:18:10,580
the comedy works.

2928
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,260
We'll take a totally
different place in the world.

2929
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:12,951
Well,

2930
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:13,480
the machine,

2931
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,301
I mean your fans,

2932
01:18:14,301 --> 01:18:15,134
your fans,

2933
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:15,780
people.

2934
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:16,100
Okay.

2935
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:17,450
That's a Shitty segue right there.

2936
01:18:17,451 --> 01:18:18,560
So we thought that,

2937
01:18:18,561 --> 01:18:20,330
I realize we just jumped off
the subject and I was like,

2938
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:20,481
oh,

2939
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:21,490
as we're talking about the special,

2940
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,380
do you think will pharaoh
when he brings his cats too,

2941
01:18:24,381 --> 01:18:25,690
like a shelter that,

2942
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,660
that they,

2943
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:29,270
he has had many times like they had asked,

2944
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:33,530
they accidentally killed a cat and what
will Pharrel brings his cats to shelters

2945
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,690
and they feed goes out of
town and he takes a drink.

2946
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,531
Just cat to a show.

2947
01:18:36,531 --> 01:18:37,580
I mean like if he did,

2948
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:40,130
do you think he would
constantly have dead cats?

2949
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:40,501
Why?

2950
01:18:40,501 --> 01:18:40,950
Why?

2951
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,410
Cause be like a pharaoh,

2952
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,273
you know,

2953
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,200
you know his last name
would mix things up,

2954
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:47,480
some paperwork or so he fucking,

2955
01:18:48,980 --> 01:18:51,260
I just kicked on defending
you when you come with that.

2956
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,080
I was just,

2957
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,501
these are like,

2958
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:54,821
no,

2959
01:18:54,821 --> 01:18:55,190
it's fine.

2960
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,880
That's what it is that you should write
down and revisit later and work on the

2961
01:18:58,881 --> 01:18:59,390
wording.

2962
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:03,260
I was incredibly disappointed that in
on purpose just because if Ari's Berlin,

2963
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,670
I'm incredibly disappointed with you.

2964
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:05,990
Brian shut you up.

2965
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,040
Nice for the rest of the show.

2966
01:19:07,041 --> 01:19:08,170
You could have walked away hero,

2967
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:09,373
but no,

2968
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:09,861
no.

2969
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:10,694
This guys right now.

2970
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:11,830
This motherfucker,

2971
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:16,870
I swear it's like find your red pick
right in your fucking stupid tee shirt.

2972
01:19:19,470 --> 01:19:20,610
Fuck you marry room.

2973
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:22,060
I fucking chow man.

2974
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,500
I still off of your whipped to goal.

2975
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:25,950
You got really high this time.

2976
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:26,341
Yeah.

2977
01:19:26,341 --> 01:19:27,780
We got wait cavalry and his Adderall.

2978
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,311
Totally different.

2979
01:19:29,311 --> 01:19:29,480
Yeah.

2980
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:29,830
You're,

2981
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:30,471
you're on a drink.

2982
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:32,430
That iced coffee on top of that as a sign.

2983
01:19:32,431 --> 01:19:34,110
I don't think he was doing those things.

2984
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,680
Adderall was like,

2985
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,180
no,

2986
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:38,013
that's a weight loss time.

2987
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,450
Is that what you're doing it for now?

2988
01:19:39,451 --> 01:19:40,590
I'm just trying to be focused right here.

2989
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,120
Oh yeah.

2990
01:19:42,121 --> 01:19:42,850
You're so good.

2991
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:45,640
Being stickers right now is a third full.

2992
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:46,340
Doesn't see that cell.

2993
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,450
I want to say that's
a 40 milligram or not.

2994
01:19:49,350 --> 01:19:50,340
That is the craziest,

2995
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:50,731
you know,

2996
01:19:50,731 --> 01:19:54,120
by the way was going be passing this
shit around in front of a camera.

2997
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:55,110
Hey,

2998
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:56,550
remember what our friend
I use Ustream told us.

2999
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,760
Well,

3000
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,440
we'll show you after I
got a prescription for it.

3001
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:00,283
It's just a Baggie.

3002
01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:01,220
Alright dude.

3003
01:20:01,220 --> 01:20:01,740
It could,

3004
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:03,480
it could be implied as some sort of,

3005
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:03,691
well,

3006
01:20:03,691 --> 01:20:03,841
it's,

3007
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:06,180
it's made by pharmaceutical
companies and it makes people happy.

3008
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:06,731
Yeah.

3009
01:20:06,731 --> 01:20:07,350
I know.

3010
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,970
Who has a fulltime prescription.

3011
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,870
He takes it every day.

3012
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,370
People who have like severity,

3013
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:13,500
do they take it to calm them
down instead of hype them up?

3014
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:14,400
I don't feel calm.

3015
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:15,000
I feel like no,

3016
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,320
you're getting a totally
different reaction.

3017
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:17,100
They are.

3018
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,671
Do you feel,

3019
01:20:17,671 --> 01:20:18,240
um,

3020
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:19,140
you feel its way to no.

3021
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:20,520
Medical doctor would prescribe it to you?

3022
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:23,520
I feel like I'm on a
coming down from a cope.

3023
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:24,630
When did you take it?

3024
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,063
Uh,

3025
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,450
four hours ago.

3026
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,790
You got plenty of time.

3027
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:31,110
How long is it going?

3028
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,860
Coming down?

3029
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,000
Size nine tangents.

3030
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:34,200
Whoa.

3031
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:35,880
Jesus Christ to more podcasts.

3032
01:20:35,881 --> 01:20:36,330
And I said,

3033
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,163
perfect.

3034
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,180
Wow Dude.

3035
01:20:39,181 --> 01:20:39,990
That's uh,

3036
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:40,080
uh,

3037
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,370
you sure that it's healthy,

3038
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,600
that stuff.

3039
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:43,700
It's not like salad or

3040
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,020
is it drugs?

3041
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:50,070
Is it dangerous?

3042
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:52,920
No overdose on it.

3043
01:20:52,921 --> 01:20:53,460
Do you take,

3044
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:54,750
I took half a pill though.

3045
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:59,070
So would you quit saying half a pill
just told you I'm such a huge difference.

3046
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,870
You're just stop saying that.

3047
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:05,890
You just find out how much you're
taking one five milligram pill.

3048
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:06,290
It was,

3049
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:09,960
it's the same as Catholics Horse Brian.

3050
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:13,080
There might be a horse dosage if

3051
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:16,890
strong one's available.

3052
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:18,001
And you took a half.

3053
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:20,760
I've heard of a 10 and a 20 you
get that cracked out right now,

3054
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:21,603
son.

3055
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:23,520
Just whoa.

3056
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:23,941
Easy.

3057
01:21:23,941 --> 01:21:24,774
Just give me a taste.

3058
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,650
Come down from Adderall.

3059
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:27,570
Is there a way to get,

3060
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:28,650
I think you crush.

3061
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,150
You just cook.

3062
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:34,000
Is there anything you can take to like
two in order to come down like Adderall

3063
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,040
lighter does it at the
end of the day though,

3064
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:39,810
my friend was on it all the time.

3065
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,940
Said that sometimes if he has
to do something late at night,

3066
01:21:41,941 --> 01:21:42,960
like a late night show,

3067
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,720
it's badly timed and you know,

3068
01:21:45,730 --> 01:21:47,700
because he takes his stuff
at a certain time every day.

3069
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,560
Oh yeah.

3070
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,410
There's a late night show.

3071
01:21:49,411 --> 01:21:50,244
It fucks him up.

3072
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,300
Oh yeah.

3073
01:21:51,301 --> 01:21:51,841
I guess that's why,

3074
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:53,400
but if I take one of
those five hour energies,

3075
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:53,661
no,

3076
01:21:53,661 --> 01:21:53,821
not,

3077
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:54,690
doesn't get too hyper.

3078
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:55,470
He's done.

3079
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:57,110
By the time the late
night show rolls around,

3080
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:57,820
he's over.

3081
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:58,000
He's,

3082
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:58,770
he's tired.

3083
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:01,260
He can't take it too late because they
won't be able to sleep on that exact a

3084
01:22:01,261 --> 01:22:02,094
mundo.

3085
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:04,420
Medicated Medicaid.

3086
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:08,160
We live in a strange world.

3087
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,393
New Drug.

3088
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:09,901
What is it?

3089
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:14,070
A Cop told me in Austin Krokodil oh,

3090
01:22:14,071 --> 01:22:14,520
that's a,

3091
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,420
that's a drug from a,

3092
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,190
um,

3093
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:16,620
um,

3094
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:17,453
Russia.

3095
01:22:17,490 --> 01:22:18,270
Yeah.

3096
01:22:18,270 --> 01:22:21,630
A lot of guys that were hooked on heroin
or taking it and it makes their skin

3097
01:22:21,631 --> 01:22:22,290
rot.

3098
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:23,340
It makes your skin rocks.

3099
01:22:23,341 --> 01:22:25,530
We can see the bone through your skin.

3100
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:26,611
Have you seen it?

3101
01:22:26,611 --> 01:22:28,860
They call it something else like
meow meow or something like that.

3102
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:29,520
Maybe.

3103
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:29,770
I Dunno.

3104
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,050
It's called Krokodil though.

3105
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,080
It so is that what it is?

3106
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:34,163
Horrifying.

3107
01:22:34,270 --> 01:22:34,560
Yeah.

3108
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,110
They said it takes about
two years to kill Ya.

3109
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:37,260
So it be plenty of time.

3110
01:22:37,261 --> 01:22:38,340
You can be like it just a little worse.

3111
01:22:38,341 --> 01:22:39,174
Just a little worse.

3112
01:22:39,570 --> 01:22:40,530
It must feel amazing.

3113
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:41,731
That's what I asked the cop.

3114
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:42,391
It's only about it.

3115
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:42,870
I was like,

3116
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:43,111
how,

3117
01:22:43,111 --> 01:22:44,310
what's it feel like?

3118
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:44,941
Awesome.

3119
01:22:44,941 --> 01:22:45,750
Right.

3120
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:50,060
I mean it's making people have like
rotten holes in their body where they're

3121
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:50,903
shooting it in.

3122
01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:51,720
I mean,

3123
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:54,210
it's really crazy to look at
when we look at the images,

3124
01:22:54,211 --> 01:22:55,470
it just rots away your skin.

3125
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:56,670
We talked about this on this pocket.

3126
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:56,911
No,

3127
01:22:56,911 --> 01:22:58,790
we never have take this.

3128
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,800
I don't know anybody who range,

3129
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:02,101
man.

3130
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:02,461
Hey Man,

3131
01:23:02,461 --> 01:23:03,420
I got just good shit.

3132
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:04,980
It makes your skin fall off.

3133
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:05,171
Well,

3134
01:23:05,171 --> 01:23:06,610
that's not the effect that they want.

3135
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,490
Something I'll tell you about.

3136
01:23:09,491 --> 01:23:10,750
People are so crazy,

3137
01:23:10,751 --> 01:23:11,051
bro.

3138
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:12,130
There's so crazy.

3139
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,590
It's just such a weird animal.

3140
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:17,450
Just the fact to know
how much to take us down.

3141
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:17,800
Yeah.

3142
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:17,951
Well,

3143
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:18,640
how about none?

3144
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:19,473
That's the good move.

3145
01:23:19,690 --> 01:23:22,180
My friend told me he took mushrooms in
Amsterdam and he didn't like him and I

3146
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:22,450
was like,

3147
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:22,721
oh,

3148
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:23,554
well how much should you take?

3149
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:24,071
Where'd you take him?

3150
01:23:24,071 --> 01:23:24,610
He goes,

3151
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,430
I took 20 grams and I went to the,

3152
01:23:26,431 --> 01:23:26,681
I was like,

3153
01:23:26,681 --> 01:23:27,514
what?

3154
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:28,121
Well,

3155
01:23:28,121 --> 01:23:31,030
that's why it's like drinking a
fucking bottle of Tequila and saying,

3156
01:23:31,031 --> 01:23:31,900
I don't like booths.

3157
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,040
20 grams.

3158
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:33,903
Yeah.

3159
01:23:34,170 --> 01:23:35,003
Yeah.

3160
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,800
It sounds like you're not a
grams in a pound and a pound.

3161
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:39,220
I Dunno.

3162
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,380
An ounce is like,

3163
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:41,531
oh,

3164
01:23:41,531 --> 01:23:42,041
that's different.

3165
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:44,000
I don't know how many pounds.

3166
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:44,710
Yeah,

3167
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:45,251
it's at what,

3168
01:23:45,251 --> 01:23:45,971
two and a half ounces?

3169
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:47,950
I think two and a half ounces in a pound.

3170
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:48,821
Maybe.

3171
01:23:48,821 --> 01:23:49,654
I'm totally wrong.

3172
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:50,620
I don't know how many grams.

3173
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:52,990
20 grams would be about an ounce.

3174
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:53,913
Would that be right?

3175
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:58,750
One pound equals 453 grams.

3176
01:23:58,810 --> 01:23:59,141
Okay.

3177
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:00,070
So we took 20 rooms.

3178
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:00,993
Nowhere near a pound.

3179
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:01,600
Yeah,

3180
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,433
nowhere near it.

3181
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:05,530
But still he imagined
you a pound of mushrooms.

3182
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:06,364
Oh my God.

3183
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,450
Kill you.

3184
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:07,841
What's the,

3185
01:24:07,841 --> 01:24:08,470
I wonder,

3186
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:09,220
let's find out.

3187
01:24:09,220 --> 01:24:09,491
You would,

3188
01:24:09,491 --> 01:24:10,140
you might,

3189
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,430
you might die from eating the
same thing of any one food.

3190
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:13,270
I think the last time,

3191
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,760
the one time that I took it
where I think I overdosed,

3192
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:21,570
I think I came out to about
a quarter in a like a,

3193
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:22,680
an eight.

3194
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:23,513
A quarter.

3195
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:24,380
A quarter.

3196
01:24:24,380 --> 01:24:24,990
An eighth.

3197
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:27,070
So one once I seen one,

3198
01:24:27,071 --> 01:24:27,400
eight,

3199
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:27,611
two,

3200
01:24:27,611 --> 01:24:27,950
eight,

3201
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:28,181
three,

3202
01:24:28,181 --> 01:24:28,630
eight,

3203
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:28,811
three,

3204
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,770
eight Jesus.

3205
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:30,604
He threw me off.

3206
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:31,740
Yeah,

3207
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:32,573
it took three days.

3208
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:32,730
Yeah,

3209
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:33,191
that's a lot.

3210
01:24:33,191 --> 01:24:34,390
What kind of mushrooms do you remember?

3211
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,810
I don't know if the ones
that look like fake.

3212
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:38,220
I like Mario Brother Mushrooms.

3213
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:40,560
Like the stamps were really
big and the caps were like,

3214
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:42,200
like ridiculously fun.

3215
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:47,720
280 milligrams per kilogram
for a rat killer rot.

3216
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,320
200 what?

3217
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,660
280 milligrams per kilogram.

3218
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:53,201
Like,

3219
01:24:53,201 --> 01:24:54,550
I dunno how many kilos.

3220
01:24:54,551 --> 01:24:55,070
Erratic.

3221
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:55,691
So how much killer,

3222
01:24:55,691 --> 01:24:56,530
how many killers am I?

3223
01:24:57,220 --> 01:24:57,401
Well,

3224
01:24:57,401 --> 01:24:59,700
the problem with all this LD 50 for rats.

3225
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:02,890
There's a lot of shit that kills
animals that doesn't kill us,

3226
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:07,330
but there are also a lot of things to
kill both rats and us and there's also a

3227
01:25:07,331 --> 01:25:08,540
lot of things like way more things.

3228
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:09,281
Kill Rats,

3229
01:25:09,281 --> 01:25:10,240
but does kill us.

3230
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:11,093
Kill us.

3231
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:15,310
The fucking disgusting vcs.

3232
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,660
They're really disgusting.

3233
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:17,813
Date each other.

3234
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,270
I've told this story before,

3235
01:25:19,271 --> 01:25:20,660
I killed a big ass rat,

3236
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:24,460
my fucking garage and Encino killer
with a trap and I'm just late at night.

3237
01:25:24,461 --> 01:25:24,940
It was like,

3238
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:25,691
I heard it stop,

3239
01:25:25,691 --> 01:25:28,810
go off while I was writing and I went
out and got it tomorrow I would got up in

3240
01:25:28,811 --> 01:25:31,120
the morning and there
was nothing but skin,

3241
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:33,790
a little bit of skin and a tail.

3242
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:35,680
They ate that fucking rat.

3243
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,750
We had a rather truth through
its tail in order to get out.

3244
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:38,880
Ooh.

3245
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:41,501
Yeah.

3246
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:43,750
This route was a big fucking rat to man.

3247
01:25:43,751 --> 01:25:46,990
They had some big hill rats up
there in the Hollywood hills.

3248
01:25:46,991 --> 01:25:48,130
I got a real problem.

3249
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:49,121
And from New York,

3250
01:25:49,121 --> 01:25:49,954
they're everywhere.

3251
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:50,300
Yeah,

3252
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,133
some dude was,

3253
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:52,780
would you rather have mice or rats?

3254
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:53,973
Mice.

3255
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:57,170
Mice by a long shot and time that
that one guy that we had on the shed,

3256
01:25:57,171 --> 01:25:58,004
the hoarder guy,

3257
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,613
what's his face?

3258
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:00,880
I can't even think of his name right now,

3259
01:26:01,270 --> 01:26:02,350
but we're looking at Matt.

3260
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:04,070
He said that he would rather have rats

3261
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:06,171
and Anthony,

3262
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:06,441
yesterday,

3263
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:08,950
a friend of mine lived in the
Hollywood hills or his brother.

3264
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:10,820
His friend lives in the
Hollywood hills and they were,

3265
01:26:10,821 --> 01:26:11,090
uh,

3266
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:13,070
he had to like a dope
house with a theater,

3267
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:14,660
but when they were watching the movies,

3268
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:14,991
he goes,

3269
01:26:14,991 --> 01:26:16,090
when the movie comes on,

3270
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:16,341
he goes,

3271
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:17,174
put your feet up.

3272
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,100
Because sometimes rats
run across the floor.

3273
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:20,361
It's like,

3274
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:20,960
what?

3275
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,291
He's like,

3276
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:21,501
yeah,

3277
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:22,071
I get away.

3278
01:26:22,071 --> 01:26:22,881
Worst movie.

3279
01:26:22,881 --> 01:26:23,181
He goes,

3280
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:23,941
if you live in the hills,

3281
01:26:23,941 --> 01:26:24,940
there's just no way to avoid them.

3282
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:26,150
What could you imagine?

3283
01:26:26,151 --> 01:26:28,550
There's no way to avoid
rats in your fucking house.

3284
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,283
Like ants.

3285
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:31,490
That's crazy though.

3286
01:26:31,491 --> 01:26:32,540
It's little animals.

3287
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:33,374
Sedans.

3288
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:34,490
Wow.

3289
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:38,540
If you've seen new treatise of your
single giant rats in the south.

3290
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:39,250
Yeah.

3291
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,540
They went David Tillman
Nutrient Hunting Watson.

3292
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,270
Yeah.

3293
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:47,270
I found out about it out loud about it
too was that was that show insomniac

3294
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:51,620
while I was watching some show on the,

3295
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,010
uh,

3296
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:56,000
one of those outdoor channels I was
hunting and there's the dude's a chef,

3297
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:58,580
I think that's called dead
meat or something like that.

3298
01:26:58,580 --> 01:26:59,420
That's the name of the show.

3299
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:00,500
And uh,

3300
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,540
he would go and he,

3301
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:05,780
he'll shoot all kinds of weird things
and cook them like all kinds of weird

3302
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:06,111
animals.

3303
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:07,610
And so they cook nutria.

3304
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,720
They shot these nutrients,

3305
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:12,090
but there's a balancing nutrients
for every nutrient you kill.

3306
01:27:12,091 --> 01:27:13,190
They give you five bucks.

3307
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:13,671
Wow.

3308
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:14,130
Really?

3309
01:27:14,130 --> 01:27:14,570
Yeah.

3310
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:15,710
I've ever make a living that way.

3311
01:27:15,740 --> 01:27:16,190
Yeah.

3312
01:27:16,190 --> 01:27:18,110
If you have a seven
inch tail and you know,

3313
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:18,500
they're,

3314
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:19,281
they're big man.

3315
01:27:19,281 --> 01:27:20,210
There's a lot of them.

3316
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:21,470
Do they attack people or they're just,

3317
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:22,340
no,

3318
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,210
they're vegetarians.

3319
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:24,470
We just kill them.

3320
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:25,700
The problem is they're,

3321
01:27:25,701 --> 01:27:27,830
they're destroying the wetlands.

3322
01:27:27,860 --> 01:27:28,550
They are there.

3323
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:31,040
Their rate of erosion caused by nutrients.

3324
01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:32,150
Where does it come from?

3325
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,230
Some insane amount.

3326
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:34,940
It was like they came
from another country,

3327
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:40,340
350 yards or 350 acres a day.

3328
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,750
They were killer roading.

3329
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:42,351
Yeah.

3330
01:27:42,351 --> 01:27:46,370
These animals were eroding like an insane
amount of ground they can cover in a

3331
01:27:46,371 --> 01:27:50,000
day and they're just
jacking all these wetlands.

3332
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,550
And so since they started
this bounty on him,

3333
01:27:52,551 --> 01:27:55,100
the show said that they dropped
it down to 50 acres a day.

3334
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:56,180
But there's still,

3335
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:57,830
there's still fucking things up.

3336
01:27:57,831 --> 01:27:58,340
I mean,

3337
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:00,110
it's like the bigger is a lot to lose.

3338
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,060
One day day,

3339
01:28:02,061 --> 01:28:03,800
they're just jacking these fucking,

3340
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:04,910
all this wetlands,

3341
01:28:04,911 --> 01:28:08,060
they just kill all the vegetation
and all these a swampy,

3342
01:28:08,061 --> 01:28:08,960
crazy areas.

3343
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:10,790
They just kill all the vegetation there.

3344
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:11,590
Huge.

3345
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:13,840
The fucking thing was
like a dog man and the,

3346
01:28:13,910 --> 01:28:14,450
this dude,

3347
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:16,790
they went out and they shot
him and like an hour's time,

3348
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:20,300
they shot like six or seven of them and
they throw him in the boat and they took

3349
01:28:20,301 --> 01:28:21,200
them back and cook them.

3350
01:28:21,650 --> 01:28:22,580
It was really weird,

3351
01:28:22,581 --> 01:28:22,821
man.

3352
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:24,860
It was funny how everybody
was like repulsed by it.

3353
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:26,810
Like everybody that they
told that it was a Nutria,

3354
01:28:26,811 --> 01:28:27,140
they like,

3355
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:27,973
Ooh,

3356
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:29,720
but if you tell somebody you got a pig,

3357
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:30,201
like what is,

3358
01:28:30,201 --> 01:28:31,100
he wants Bacon.

3359
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,830
It's like we came up
with cool names for shit.

3360
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:35,630
That's not the Atmel itself,

3361
01:28:35,631 --> 01:28:36,464
like beef.

3362
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:37,970
Beef is cow,

3363
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:38,481
you know,

3364
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:39,081
Venison.

3365
01:28:39,081 --> 01:28:40,350
Venison is a,

3366
01:28:40,351 --> 01:28:41,184
a deer.

3367
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,133
You know what I mean?

3368
01:28:42,210 --> 01:28:42,950
They would have to come.

3369
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,510
You can't just say
you're going to eat rat.

3370
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,710
You can tell you I'm going to eat chicken.

3371
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:46,460
Yeah.

3372
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:46,851
Chicken us.

3373
01:28:46,851 --> 01:28:48,380
True chicken is only chicken.

3374
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:49,363
Yeah.

3375
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:52,370
But like pork is like Bacon.

3376
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:53,151
Ham.

3377
01:28:53,151 --> 01:28:53,900
You can have,

3378
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:54,680
you can have work.

3379
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:55,310
Yeah.

3380
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:56,930
You gotta have a couple
of different names for it.

3381
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:58,460
Vacant.

3382
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:59,510
So fucking good.

3383
01:28:59,511 --> 01:29:00,000
So good.

3384
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,100
It's so good.

3385
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,300
Been at Denny's when they have bacon shit.

3386
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:03,900
Oh yeah.

3387
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:05,430
The fat and the crispy meat.

3388
01:29:05,431 --> 01:29:06,570
It's so delicious.

3389
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:08,033
Shakes.

3390
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:08,671
Yeah.

3391
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:09,660
It's so delicious.

3392
01:29:09,661 --> 01:29:09,931
Dot.

3393
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:10,141
I mean,

3394
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:11,970
this has been talked
to death by Comedians,

3395
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:12,930
but the idea of,

3396
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:13,230
uh,

3397
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:15,070
it's become carts or almost like a joke.

3398
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:15,430
Yeah.

3399
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:16,610
Put Bacon on any kind of food.

3400
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:17,410
It makes it better.

3401
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:18,243
Yeah.

3402
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:19,180
Yeah.

3403
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,310
Chocolate and Bacon's good.

3404
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:21,001
Have you ever had that too?

3405
01:29:21,001 --> 01:29:21,420
It's okay.

3406
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,340
How did the fair ones?

3407
01:29:22,370 --> 01:29:22,920
Yeah.

3408
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,141
Yeah.

3409
01:29:23,141 --> 01:29:23,421
I've had,

3410
01:29:23,421 --> 01:29:24,480
they put a little salt on it.

3411
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:26,280
You know what's amazing man?

3412
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:27,510
Salted Carmel.

3413
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,400
Oh yeah.

3414
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:28,960
Oh,

3415
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,010
that shit's good.

3416
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:31,410
I just feel like that's all stirred.

3417
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:32,011
Yeah.

3418
01:29:32,011 --> 01:29:33,120
Salted caramel ice cream.

3419
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:33,781
Holy Shit.

3420
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:34,614
I know you're talking about,

3421
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:35,970
there's a place in Denver too,

3422
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:36,771
I forget the name of it,

3423
01:29:36,771 --> 01:29:39,450
but they have amazing
salted caramel ice cream.

3424
01:29:39,451 --> 01:29:40,284
Sounds amazing.

3425
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,270
And Denver's where arched
fears going to be next week.

3426
01:29:42,271 --> 01:29:43,890
Recording fucking powerful pamphlets.

3427
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:44,131
You see,

3428
01:29:44,131 --> 01:29:45,710
that's a segue son.

3429
01:29:45,770 --> 01:29:47,430
That's how he wants it on there.

3430
01:29:47,431 --> 01:29:48,750
The 10th through the 12th of May.

3431
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:50,190
But I bought the cool people,

3432
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,590
like all these people listening he wants.

3433
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:53,491
So,

3434
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:53,770
uh,

3435
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:54,481
and by the way,

3436
01:29:54,481 --> 01:29:55,291
the comedy works,

3437
01:29:55,291 --> 01:29:56,041
you owe it to yourself.

3438
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:57,310
If you're going to see a comic like Ari,

3439
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:01,200
go to the best club in the FEC and country
and the comedy works in Denver might

3440
01:30:01,201 --> 01:30:02,040
just be that club.

3441
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:03,180
If it's not the best club,

3442
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:03,901
guess what?

3443
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:04,734
There's no better.

3444
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,500
There's no better club than the comedy
works in Denver and there's no better

3445
01:30:07,501 --> 01:30:08,021
club in,

3446
01:30:08,021 --> 01:30:08,854
in the planet.

3447
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:09,760
There's just not,

3448
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,370
there's the clubs that are just as good,

3449
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:12,990
but there's no better
cuts on any list of like,

3450
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,910
these are the clubs I like
to play before I stop.

3451
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,620
The comedy works in Denver is it's at the
level of the best club in the country.

3452
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:22,260
I don't think there's any one best
club in the country cause there's like,

3453
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,370
like a helium and Philly
that's the same level,

3454
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,430
the same level.

3455
01:30:26,431 --> 01:30:27,001
There's no,

3456
01:30:27,001 --> 01:30:28,320
there's nothing bad about that club.

3457
01:30:28,321 --> 01:30:28,981
It's perfect.

3458
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:31,290
That's the one of the best
clubs in the country and the I,

3459
01:30:31,291 --> 01:30:31,891
in my opinion,

3460
01:30:31,891 --> 01:30:34,590
like helium and Philly and
the comedy works in Denver.

3461
01:30:34,591 --> 01:30:36,090
They're the same level of club.

3462
01:30:36,091 --> 01:30:38,340
I think that that place
is as good as it gets.

3463
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:39,173
It's the,

3464
01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:40,260
it's the cream of the crop.

3465
01:30:40,261 --> 01:30:41,320
As far as comedy clubs go.

3466
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:46,230
Denver is the stoniest coolest
fucking city in the country.

3467
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:47,450
I loved Denver.

3468
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,930
Coming back to Columbus,

3469
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:49,830
I'm going to,

3470
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:50,300
yeah.

3471
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:50,701
You know what?

3472
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:51,534
I'm going to go from there.

3473
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:52,290
I'm going to book that.

3474
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,900
I'm booking a bunch of shit now that
I have to write a bunch of new stuff,

3475
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:56,100
so when it come to Columbus,

3476
01:30:56,101 --> 01:30:56,701
that's probably what I'll do.

3477
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:58,150
I'll probably do the comedy
club for a couple of times.

3478
01:30:58,151 --> 01:30:58,320
Yeah,

3479
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:58,891
the funny bugs,

3480
01:30:58,891 --> 01:30:59,610
a good club there,

3481
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:01,320
but isn't it weird having that place?

3482
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:02,310
Doesn't have a green room.

3483
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:04,200
It's like need them.

3484
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:05,430
I kinda like it.

3485
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:05,880
I like,

3486
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:06,780
I like when you're roughing it.

3487
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:08,700
Yeah.

3488
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:10,620
I like when you have to live like that.

3489
01:31:10,621 --> 01:31:11,820
Sometimes it's realistic.

3490
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:12,450
It's good.

3491
01:31:12,450 --> 01:31:15,000
It's good for you when you have to be in
the hallway warming up and it's fucking

3492
01:31:15,001 --> 01:31:16,200
people walking by with drinks.

3493
01:31:16,620 --> 01:31:17,431
It seems stupid,

3494
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:18,264
but I think,

3495
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:19,440
I think all that stuff,

3496
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,030
you should never get away from that,

3497
01:31:21,031 --> 01:31:21,630
that all that,

3498
01:31:21,630 --> 01:31:22,200
that,

3499
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,460
that's a real comedy club,

3500
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:24,030
man.

3501
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:24,390
That's,

3502
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:24,780
that's,

3503
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,400
that's where we all cut our teeth.

3504
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:27,180
That's where,

3505
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:30,390
that's what's responsible for
a lot of guys making a living.

3506
01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:31,590
Those kinds of clubs,

3507
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:31,831
that's,

3508
01:31:31,831 --> 01:31:32,880
those are real places.

3509
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:36,900
When you're there for two or three hours
over it just nice to have a place to

3510
01:31:36,901 --> 01:31:37,580
put your stuff,

3511
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:38,131
but you know what?

3512
01:31:38,131 --> 01:31:40,830
Just go out and sit with the
people at the bar who gives a fuck.

3513
01:31:40,831 --> 01:31:41,970
Just go hang out with people.

3514
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:46,110
That patio is so big that he should
just put a shed out there or an error.

3515
01:31:46,111 --> 01:31:46,740
Steam.

3516
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:50,100
What if you pulled up in one of those
[inaudible] airstream trailer and every

3517
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:53,640
bad ass patio because people
can't smoke in the bars,

3518
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:54,160
right?

3519
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,590
Isn't that to get a lot of smoke,

3520
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:55,950
isn't it?

3521
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:56,783
The laws now.

3522
01:31:56,990 --> 01:31:57,240
Right,

3523
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,380
so you have to go outside to smoke.

3524
01:31:59,170 --> 01:31:59,471
Yeah.

3525
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:04,240
That's a that that law apparently is
a big divider amongst the pool world.

3526
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,400
Pool players have really upset.

3527
01:32:06,430 --> 01:32:06,820
Really?

3528
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,001
Yeah,

3529
01:32:07,001 --> 01:32:07,930
because a lot of guys,

3530
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:08,471
first of all,

3531
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:09,131
when the gambling,

3532
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:11,710
they would just constantly be
smoking or had the same problem.

3533
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:12,310
Yeah.

3534
01:32:12,310 --> 01:32:13,061
They tried to get it out.

3535
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:13,780
There was the last link,

3536
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:14,613
the leaf casinos.

3537
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,593
The poker area.

3538
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:15,851
Yeah.

3539
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:16,511
I know him for that.

3540
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:17,830
That deep breath that I just took,

3541
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:18,910
that was like a lot of guys,

3542
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:19,500
they need that.

3543
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:20,333
They needed that.

3544
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:23,440
They needed that cigarette
to calm them down.

3545
01:32:23,441 --> 01:32:24,050
Whether gamble.

3546
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:24,791
I don't think they needed it.

3547
01:32:24,791 --> 01:32:25,840
I think I just got used to it.

3548
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:27,400
I know they're resisting change.

3549
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:29,440
They're addicted and
when they're addicted,

3550
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:29,741
yeah,

3551
01:32:29,741 --> 01:32:30,380
you need it.

3552
01:32:30,380 --> 01:32:30,980
You know,

3553
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:31,330
I,

3554
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:34,420
I've seen a lot of guys who just got
really pissed off and they would start

3555
01:32:34,421 --> 01:32:36,030
going to places that would allow smoking,

3556
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,630
would let you chain smoke.

3557
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:38,021
So it's like,

3558
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:38,890
I've thought like going out,

3559
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,270
I can't just keep going outside.

3560
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,320
I just want to keep going.

3561
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:43,850
The only way they can make
that different is if you,

3562
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:44,200
uh,

3563
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,520
made it a private club.

3564
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,020
Like I'm,

3565
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:47,590
I belonged to a cigar club.

3566
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:50,710
It's a very whole too schmaltzy
me and my brother Matt.

3567
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,030
And when we go,

3568
01:32:52,031 --> 01:32:52,421
we,

3569
01:32:52,421 --> 01:32:52,690
uh,

3570
01:32:52,690 --> 01:32:56,470
we can go and smoke cigars with always
people like out in those plants in a food

3571
01:32:56,471 --> 01:32:57,520
and we act like assholes,

3572
01:32:58,370 --> 01:32:59,230
like big wigs,

3573
01:32:59,231 --> 01:32:59,680
you know,

3574
01:32:59,680 --> 01:33:01,870
like a deal maker.

3575
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:05,840
I'm a deal breaker up here at 17 and
it's kind of a crazy place cause it's,

3576
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,390
the girls are all really pretty and
they like scantily clad and they serve

3577
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:11,530
excellent food.

3578
01:33:11,531 --> 01:33:12,730
And there's all these rich guys out there.

3579
01:33:13,030 --> 01:33:14,500
You always see him like
movie stars and Shit,

3580
01:33:14,710 --> 01:33:15,490
but it's a club,

3581
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:15,701
you know,

3582
01:33:15,701 --> 01:33:16,570
and you're allowed to,

3583
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,640
you're allowed to smoke
cigars at this club.

3584
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:22,390
They should make a place
where you know how many clubs?

3585
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,633
What's that?

3586
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:24,750
What?

3587
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:26,150
I was going to say that.

3588
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,003
What's that one?

3589
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:28,980
Scared Toronto.

3590
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:29,731
Oh No,

3591
01:33:29,731 --> 01:33:30,221
in Toronto?

3592
01:33:30,221 --> 01:33:30,640
Yeah.

3593
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:31,011
Oh,

3594
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:31,844
the one to here.

3595
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:33,600
How's it shut it down.

3596
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:34,443
The back room.

3597
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,240
They get scared because I'm going to go,

3598
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,210
when the shut downs was starting,

3599
01:33:37,211 --> 01:33:37,511
they were like,

3600
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:39,700
we don't want to take any chances
because people don't know how much we're

3601
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:40,481
allowed to go away with,

3602
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:41,314
so just guessing.

3603
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:42,341
They were gonna shut down.

3604
01:33:42,341 --> 01:33:42,791
Times are like,

3605
01:33:42,791 --> 01:33:42,931
what?

3606
01:33:42,931 --> 01:33:43,211
Stop.

3607
01:33:43,211 --> 01:33:43,901
It was a hash mark.

3608
01:33:43,901 --> 01:33:44,734
It was so great.

3609
01:33:45,460 --> 01:33:45,881
Full Hash,

3610
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:46,960
but people go there to write.

3611
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:50,950
That guy came up to me a couple of times
when we're doing sales and he asked me

3612
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:52,240
to do shows there and I was like,

3613
01:33:52,241 --> 01:33:53,140
you're going to jail.

3614
01:33:53,570 --> 01:33:54,060
Really?

3615
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:54,610
Like,

3616
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:55,443
I'm like,

3617
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,720
if everyone's in there with a car,

3618
01:33:56,721 --> 01:33:57,460
why does it matter?

3619
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:58,293
Smoke there.

3620
01:33:58,660 --> 01:33:59,200
There's,

3621
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,490
there's the possibility.

3622
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:05,110
Always a federal federal intervention
if the DEA is in town because they're

3623
01:34:05,111 --> 01:34:07,280
going to start cutting down there anyway.

3624
01:34:07,450 --> 01:34:08,710
They just have a regular pot room.

3625
01:34:09,790 --> 01:34:10,030
Yeah,

3626
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:11,160
but not that word,

3627
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:13,870
but that's where people are
going to be getting high,

3628
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,090
actually physically getting
high and a lot of them,

3629
01:34:16,091 --> 01:34:17,920
I guarantee you are not going to be legal,

3630
01:34:18,190 --> 01:34:20,050
is going to be a lot of sneaky hippies.

3631
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,140
That Mama didn't know the
money to redeem that card.

3632
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:25,000
What's the hassle?

3633
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,370
It should totally be illegal anyway.

3634
01:34:26,371 --> 01:34:28,480
Men Nature gave me my license.

3635
01:34:30,190 --> 01:34:31,920
A few of those fuckers are gonna.

3636
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:32,830
They're gonna arrest them.

3637
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:33,971
You could be,

3638
01:34:33,971 --> 01:34:35,500
they're doing a show while that goes down.

3639
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:36,720
You might go to jail too.

3640
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:37,450
Every time I'm like,

3641
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:38,021
I want to wait.

3642
01:34:38,021 --> 01:34:39,160
When your card has said we've got renewed,

3643
01:34:39,161 --> 01:34:41,320
let's say May 1st you're
like ultra by bunch of weed,

3644
01:34:41,321 --> 01:34:44,230
April 29th and that'll
last me til like June 30th.

3645
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:44,980
Uh,

3646
01:34:44,980 --> 01:34:45,311
but then like,

3647
01:34:45,311 --> 01:34:46,000
what am I doing?

3648
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:46,120
Well,

3649
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,790
I was trying to buy two months
for the fucking $45 it costs.

3650
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:51,080
It is beautiful that you can
just go to a store and buy it.

3651
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:51,290
Yeah.

3652
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:51,980
I really,

3653
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,640
I said,

3654
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,160
I don't think that's going to go away
now just because of the fact that it's

3655
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:55,860
changes to it.

3656
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:56,693
Real gold now.

3657
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:57,291
Yeah.

3658
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,550
It has a big impact on the,

3659
01:34:58,640 --> 01:34:59,570
the economy.

3660
01:34:59,571 --> 01:35:03,200
It's just the rest of the country really
doesn't know that kind of freedom yet.

3661
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:05,600
They don't know how easy
it is to live like this.

3662
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:06,823
You know,

3663
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,270
it's great.

3664
01:35:08,420 --> 01:35:10,550
And people who think there's
anything wrong with it,

3665
01:35:10,551 --> 01:35:12,110
you're being silly.

3666
01:35:12,350 --> 01:35:13,100
It's drugs,

3667
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:13,661
it's drugs.

3668
01:35:13,661 --> 01:35:14,840
Like that's not a good enough answer.

3669
01:35:14,841 --> 01:35:15,770
So it was alcohol.

3670
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:16,700
So it was Adderall.

3671
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:17,081
So it was,

3672
01:35:17,081 --> 01:35:18,440
that shows this coffee,

3673
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:19,040
I'm drinking,

3674
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,850
this is a drug,

3675
01:35:19,850 --> 01:35:20,251
my shit.

3676
01:35:20,251 --> 01:35:20,631
He's like,

3677
01:35:20,631 --> 01:35:20,781
yeah,

3678
01:35:20,781 --> 01:35:21,620
so what's a drug?

3679
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:24,130
So is this an Uber ring
I have in my trucks?

3680
01:35:25,630 --> 01:35:25,940
Trucks,

3681
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:26,570
all you want,

3682
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:27,403
what's the difference?

3683
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:29,950
People are scared and Ari Shaffir there,

3684
01:35:29,951 --> 01:35:31,100
God damn scared.

3685
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:32,360
They're scared of void.

3686
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:34,820
Cigarettes have addictive
nicotine him and did,

3687
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:36,680
you shouldn't say like well just
cause they're doing something wrong.

3688
01:35:36,681 --> 01:35:37,371
You should be allowed to,

3689
01:35:37,371 --> 01:35:39,570
but like we are going to have to.

3690
01:35:39,571 --> 01:35:40,341
So you know,

3691
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:41,390
I was going to write this thing.

3692
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:42,890
I wrote this whole thing about this,

3693
01:35:42,891 --> 01:35:44,300
this Trayvon Martin thing.

3694
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:49,580
When that kid got shot and there was all
these people are rallying one way or no

3695
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:49,870
problems,

3696
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:51,080
no one really knows what happened.

3697
01:35:52,150 --> 01:35:52,730
Exactly.

3698
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:53,720
No one does know what happened,

3699
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,130
but my,

3700
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:55,700
my,

3701
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:56,511
my feeling was like,

3702
01:35:56,511 --> 01:35:56,751
man,

3703
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,140
when are we going to evolve past the
point where that's even a concern.

3704
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,770
Exactly what I'm going to evolve past
the point where people were breaking into

3705
01:36:03,771 --> 01:36:05,090
people's houses and stealing shit.

3706
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:08,480
When are we going to evolve past the
point where people are starting shit with

3707
01:36:08,481 --> 01:36:09,860
people because they're packing a gun.

3708
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:13,310
Is there ever going to come a
time when that that's the past.

3709
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,250
We were not hacking each other with
swords in the streets every day.

3710
01:36:16,251 --> 01:36:17,330
Everywhere you live anymore,

3711
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:20,480
everything has gotten radically improved.

3712
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:24,030
Security and safety radically
improved every city,

3713
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:25,850
all over the world for animals here.

3714
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:26,391
Yeah,

3715
01:36:26,391 --> 01:36:27,171
but I know when they said,

3716
01:36:27,171 --> 01:36:27,291
well,

3717
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:31,040
they said they were in lines after the
tsunami and the Japanese people were in

3718
01:36:31,041 --> 01:36:32,480
lines waiting to get their food.

3719
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:36,320
It's so nice that you wait in lines here
and they don't so orderly and he was

3720
01:36:36,321 --> 01:36:36,860
like,

3721
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,011
well,

3722
01:36:37,011 --> 01:36:38,210
that's the only way it should be.

3723
01:36:38,230 --> 01:36:38,540
Yeah.

3724
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,410
What are you talking about?

3725
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:41,960
It's just we've become such
animals that we think that's great.

3726
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,321
Well,

3727
01:36:42,321 --> 01:36:45,230
we are a country without
much history or tradition.

3728
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:45,680
You know,

3729
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,160
we have a sort of a fake
history and traditional,

3730
01:36:48,161 --> 01:36:48,321
you know,

3731
01:36:48,321 --> 01:36:49,820
make a big deal out of our history.

3732
01:36:49,821 --> 01:36:50,420
You know what I'm aware,

3733
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:50,780
again,

3734
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:51,920
I know my history.

3735
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,000
You know what history,

3736
01:36:53,001 --> 01:36:54,150
a bunch of marauders,

3737
01:36:54,290 --> 01:36:58,340
great grandfather started escapees from
other countries at fucking came over

3738
01:36:58,341 --> 01:37:00,620
here and tortured and
killed all the natives.

3739
01:37:00,830 --> 01:37:02,150
Or you came later and,

3740
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:02,500
or,

3741
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:02,781
yeah,

3742
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:04,130
well you came late at my history.

3743
01:37:04,131 --> 01:37:05,540
You're white trash.

3744
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:06,920
That's not a history.

3745
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:10,430
It's silly when you stop and think about
like say the history of China or the

3746
01:37:10,431 --> 01:37:11,510
history of Japan.

3747
01:37:11,511 --> 01:37:14,450
One Country that's been in one
place for a thousands of years.

3748
01:37:14,451 --> 01:37:19,451
I mean there's a true history to Japan
and there's a history of obedience and

3749
01:37:19,551 --> 01:37:21,790
there's a history of order
and discipline and it's,

3750
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:22,310
it's uh,

3751
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:24,980
the tradition of it is far stronger
than it is in this country.

3752
01:37:25,100 --> 01:37:25,850
That's a fact.

3753
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:27,440
Brian and I saw it when
we went over there.

3754
01:37:27,650 --> 01:37:30,710
And I'm not saying that if I had to choose
between living in Japan and live in a

3755
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:33,330
generic America Chimerica Jamiroquai

3756
01:37:34,940 --> 01:37:38,240
if I had to choose which child living
in Japan or live in with Jamiroquai,

3757
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:41,660
I would say I'm going to live in Japan
because that would kill that dude.

3758
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:44,210
You wouldn't want to have as a roommate.

3759
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,230
Apparently he gets crazy.

3760
01:37:45,231 --> 01:37:46,130
I love his music though,

3761
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:46,761
don't get me wrong.

3762
01:37:46,761 --> 01:37:49,040
But apparently he gets crazy and
throws punches at people and Shit.

3763
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:50,060
But um,

3764
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:55,060
Japan was so much more polite and orderly
and even like when we were at though,

3765
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:56,430
they didn't understand

3766
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:56,760
us.

3767
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,260
So when we're at the arena,

3768
01:37:58,261 --> 01:38:02,880
once we got in and I showed them that I
had a badge they'd like talked about and

3769
01:38:02,881 --> 01:38:03,091
I go,

3770
01:38:03,091 --> 01:38:03,721
now he's with me,

3771
01:38:03,721 --> 01:38:04,200
he's with me.

3772
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:04,590
Like,

3773
01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:05,423
ah,

3774
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:06,460
they just let you go,

3775
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:07,580
let you go.

3776
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:08,730
I don't like that.

3777
01:38:08,731 --> 01:38:09,451
At some point we were like,

3778
01:38:09,451 --> 01:38:09,810
look,

3779
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:11,480
obviously you can lie to me if you want,

3780
01:38:11,481 --> 01:38:12,640
but don't please don't do that.

3781
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:13,890
I'll just check.

3782
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:14,161
Yeah,

3783
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:14,310
it's,

3784
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:15,270
there's a noticeable,

3785
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:16,820
and I'm not saying it's a perfect society,

3786
01:38:16,821 --> 01:38:18,000
a utopia or anything like that,

3787
01:38:18,001 --> 01:38:22,390
but there's a notice belief up in
inpatients in a noticeable leap up and

3788
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,270
kindness and the way people
interacted with people.

3789
01:38:24,271 --> 01:38:25,110
It was really interesting.

3790
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:25,941
That's what happens.

3791
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:28,710
We have unfettered access to a rape,

3792
01:38:28,711 --> 01:38:28,921
a ball,

3793
01:38:28,921 --> 01:38:29,754
Chinese women.

3794
01:38:29,850 --> 01:38:30,683
Is that what it is?

3795
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:32,400
I fucking like just calm down,

3796
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:34,350
just calm down and go right in London.

3797
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:35,780
Then go back to calm.

3798
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:37,860
I'm going to go back to Japan soon.

3799
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:39,220
I think me and [inaudible].

3800
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,120
Are you going to hit on a
little vacation and thinking

3801
01:38:44,010 --> 01:38:44,880
they're going to get sexy?

3802
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,100
Brad from stream has an office there,

3803
01:38:47,101 --> 01:38:48,270
so he goes all the time.

3804
01:38:48,271 --> 01:38:48,750
So it's picking.

3805
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,441
Next time it goes,

3806
01:38:49,441 --> 01:38:51,240
I might just go with
them and just a hangout.

3807
01:38:51,330 --> 01:38:51,810
Wow.

3808
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:52,111
Yeah.

3809
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:52,581
Well I,

3810
01:38:52,581 --> 01:38:54,210
I found it quite fascinating.

3811
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,020
I mean,

3812
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:59,100
I've been to several different countries
now and it really does illuminate you.

3813
01:38:59,101 --> 01:38:59,311
You know,

3814
01:38:59,311 --> 01:39:02,040
Ari and I went to Brazil
recently and we were sitting,

3815
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:03,330
it was like seven o'clock in the morning.

3816
01:39:03,450 --> 01:39:07,140
We may or may not have just smoked some
weed and we're sitting on this balcony

3817
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:10,400
overlooking this beach
and it's fun was coming a,

3818
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:14,640
the sun's coming up and we're watching
all these kids play and play soccer.

3819
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:15,240
And we were like,

3820
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:16,740
who does this in America?

3821
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,700
It's 7:00 AM who does run out there and
started playing soccer and the barefoot

3822
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:23,880
crossing the street and these other
kids got home from like going out.

3823
01:39:23,881 --> 01:39:25,550
But it was like they
looked like they're hungry,

3824
01:39:25,560 --> 01:39:25,961
they're tired,

3825
01:39:25,961 --> 01:39:27,720
they're still out with
her holding their shoes.

3826
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,340
I don't think we're just out.

3827
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:33,330
I don't think Brazil is better than
America or Americas better than Brazil,

3828
01:39:33,331 --> 01:39:38,130
but I know that that way of living is
better than the way that most people here

3829
01:39:38,131 --> 01:39:38,430
live.

3830
01:39:38,430 --> 01:39:38,790
I heard,

3831
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:40,170
I heard a quote recently,

3832
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:41,160
I think it was mark twain,

3833
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,020
but Johnny [inaudible]
had told me he goes up.

3834
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:43,950
Um,

3835
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,690
it was,

3836
01:39:44,690 --> 01:39:45,450
um,

3837
01:39:45,450 --> 01:39:47,070
comparison is the death of joy.

3838
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:47,860
Wow.

3839
01:39:47,860 --> 01:39:48,150
It's like,

3840
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:49,110
who cares what better or worse?

3841
01:39:49,111 --> 01:39:50,610
I'll just tell you what
the nice things we saw.

3842
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:51,593
That's beautiful.

3843
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,120
Do you know in Japan that
that government plays,

3844
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:55,260
it pays your electricity.

3845
01:39:55,330 --> 01:39:58,160
They pay a lot of things that like one
of those is going to change now that

3846
01:39:58,170 --> 01:40:00,210
they're power plants or
fucking melting into the earth.

3847
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:01,073
Right.

3848
01:40:01,230 --> 01:40:04,380
Or maybe they just started charging for
and they could have a better profit to

3849
01:40:04,381 --> 01:40:06,000
make sure this doesn't
happen in the future.

3850
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:08,340
I wonder if that's even
more profit on the,

3851
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:09,360
what do you mean with that too?

3852
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,171
They're fucked.

3853
01:40:10,171 --> 01:40:12,990
Brian there they have a real
problem with those three reactors.

3854
01:40:12,991 --> 01:40:14,640
How could they be possibly a fourth?

3855
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,430
How would the profits of salt,

3856
01:40:16,460 --> 01:40:17,293
the meltdown?

3857
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:17,720
Well,

3858
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:22,560
because obviously it seems like their
shit was built like retarded style,

3859
01:40:22,590 --> 01:40:23,200
you know,

3860
01:40:23,200 --> 01:40:23,560
like they,

3861
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:25,200
if they had like some more Pete,

3862
01:40:25,201 --> 01:40:26,250
like intelligent people going,

3863
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:27,001
wait a second,

3864
01:40:27,001 --> 01:40:29,100
why are you should not build it.

3865
01:40:29,101 --> 01:40:33,370
So it only goes to a way to
6.0 or 7.0 magnitude quake.

3866
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:36,960
They had it up to an 8.2 8.2
it was a even larger than that.

3867
01:40:36,961 --> 01:40:37,800
It was like a nine.

3868
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:40,500
Why don't you make that Shit 20 you know?

3869
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:40,891
Well,

3870
01:40:40,891 --> 01:40:41,870
I don't think they can't.

3871
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:43,430
The real,

3872
01:40:43,430 --> 01:40:45,620
the reality is I just go deeper and yeah,

3873
01:40:45,630 --> 01:40:46,580
I've just seen,

3874
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:48,480
we didn't we just talk
about this the other day.

3875
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:49,920
This is my take on,

3876
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:50,910
um,

3877
01:40:50,910 --> 01:40:51,290
the,

3878
01:40:51,290 --> 01:40:54,040
the craziness of nuclear
power was that it's

3879
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,050
only been around for less
than a hundred years.

3880
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:57,370
And think about it in a hundred years.

3881
01:40:57,371 --> 01:40:58,360
All the different,

3882
01:40:58,361 --> 01:41:03,361
huge cataclysmic disasters from Chernobyl
to a three mile island to this one and

3883
01:41:04,901 --> 01:41:05,700
Fukushima.

3884
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:07,300
This is three giant,

3885
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:09,430
huge ones that have
taken place and they've,

3886
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:09,670
oh,

3887
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:11,620
it's only been in less
than a hundred years.

3888
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:13,180
How long is nuclear power?

3889
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:13,780
Thank you sir.

3890
01:41:13,780 --> 01:41:15,040
How long has new clip powerful?

3891
01:41:15,041 --> 01:41:15,491
See Two.

3892
01:41:15,491 --> 01:41:15,611
Oh,

3893
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:16,241
coconut water,

3894
01:41:16,241 --> 01:41:16,901
my favorite.

3895
01:41:16,901 --> 01:41:17,561
It's delicious.

3896
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:18,520
It comes from Thailand.

3897
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:19,280
Can't be it.

3898
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,530
If it tastes so good,

3899
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:21,670
you think that it's got sugar in it.

3900
01:41:21,671 --> 01:41:22,391
And I even asked him,

3901
01:41:22,391 --> 01:41:23,500
I know you got sugar in the ship bench.

3902
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:24,740
They sell it on it.

3903
01:41:29,010 --> 01:41:30,720
Where were we before we
went in the coconut room?

3904
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:31,863
Nuclear.

3905
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:36,760
The real issue is they don't know
how to shut these fucking things off.

3906
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:37,690
And that's terrifying.

3907
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,800
It's terrifying that they,

3908
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:42,700
they're willing to build something that
they don't have an out clause with.

3909
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:45,040
They were just hoping to keep
the power on so they can cool.

3910
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:45,970
Keep it cooled off.

3911
01:41:46,240 --> 01:41:48,310
They should have never really
wants to be without nuclear power.

3912
01:41:48,430 --> 01:41:49,750
So to Sweden in 40 years,

3913
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,140
yeah,

3914
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,270
I think Norway has moved
towards that as well.

3915
01:41:52,271 --> 01:41:54,550
There's been a couple European
countries that are considering this now.

3916
01:41:54,551 --> 01:41:55,150
They realize,

3917
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:55,540
first of all,

3918
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:56,530
they're very small.

3919
01:41:56,740 --> 01:41:56,921
You know,

3920
01:41:56,921 --> 01:41:58,180
a lot of European countries.

3921
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:02,590
Think about the impact of one nuclear
power plant or two would have had on them

3922
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,630
in Japan is very small and they're seeing,

3923
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,750
they're seeing the impact
of the radiation pretty far.

3924
01:42:06,950 --> 01:42:08,560
There's some kind of met this might,

3925
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:10,540
this is O'Brien dumb shit thing,

3926
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:11,570
isn't there some kind of

3927
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:17,650
metal that they can almost as
coke cover an entire reactor,

3928
01:42:17,651 --> 01:42:17,860
like,

3929
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:18,590
like the shoe,

3930
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:19,370
like pewter,

3931
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:20,650
you're never going to feel it's too hot.

3932
01:42:20,650 --> 01:42:21,940
Everything's gonna melt in it.

3933
01:42:22,330 --> 01:42:24,620
Everything's going to be nuclear reacted.

3934
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:25,330
It's,

3935
01:42:25,330 --> 01:42:27,610
I don't understand nuclear
science enough to comment on it,

3936
01:42:27,611 --> 01:42:28,690
but what I understand,

3937
01:42:28,691 --> 01:42:31,720
they literally can't cool this thing
off and they don't know what to do and

3938
01:42:31,721 --> 01:42:34,510
they're pouring ocean water on
and try to cool off the reactors.

3939
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,310
They've eaten through their containment.

3940
01:42:36,311 --> 01:42:37,060
They don't know where,

3941
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:40,000
where it's going to go as far as like
how much it's going to impact the soil.

3942
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,940
They've never really had one
meltdown like this before,

3943
01:42:42,941 --> 01:42:44,980
let alone three meltdown in one area.

3944
01:42:45,010 --> 01:42:45,491
In Japan,

3945
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:46,324
they've never had this,

3946
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:49,120
so they've got to learn from
what happened in Chernobyl.

3947
01:42:49,121 --> 01:42:51,820
I don't know if Trenoble his
damage was as bad as this one is,

3948
01:42:51,821 --> 01:42:56,590
but it's pretty fucking significant and
this scary thing again is that there's

3949
01:42:56,591 --> 01:42:59,020
several of these things
all over the place.

3950
01:42:59,021 --> 01:42:59,770
I shouldn't say several.

3951
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:01,820
There's hundreds of moment
of the world and if,

3952
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:06,520
if these reactors keep fucking
up different spots of the world,

3953
01:43:06,610 --> 01:43:11,350
we're going to have giant areas of our
world that's contaminated in dead for

3954
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:14,920
hundreds of thousands of years and that's
the reality that we're operating under

3955
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,180
and living under right now.

3956
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:19,990
While you and I are sitting here
talking on this laptop and you know our,

3957
01:43:19,991 --> 01:43:22,240
our information is being
passed through the Internet.

3958
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:24,010
There's lights that are on and you know,

3959
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:26,770
and you're going to get in your car and
you're going to go and electricity is

3960
01:43:26,771 --> 01:43:28,840
going to fucking power that gas meter.

3961
01:43:28,841 --> 01:43:31,500
When you pump gas at the gas station
and there's going to be an electronic,

3962
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,490
all that shit is nuclear power,

3963
01:43:33,491 --> 01:43:34,180
Sun.

3964
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:37,000
All that shit is built
on the back of insanity.

3965
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:42,120
Our entire civilization runs on an
insane idea that we're going to take and

3966
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:44,530
we're going to make a nuclear reaction.

3967
01:43:44,531 --> 01:43:48,670
We're going to make a fucking reactor
and we're going to use this insanely hot

3968
01:43:48,671 --> 01:43:52,070
thing to burn water and creates steam and

3969
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,800
the steam is going to
power and make electricity.

3970
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,120
It's nuts.

3971
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,380
It's fucking crazy.

3972
01:43:57,381 --> 01:43:59,150
And it's how the whole country works.

3973
01:43:59,390 --> 01:44:02,720
The whole is essentially almost
primarily on coal and nuclear power.

3974
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:05,210
So it's either giant fires or it's,

3975
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:05,691
you know,

3976
01:44:05,691 --> 01:44:06,980
some people in mill,

3977
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,230
there's a few places that
have like windmill fields.

3978
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:10,580
Yeah,

3979
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:12,380
dams can generate some electricity,

3980
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,970
but there's a lot of it that it's nuclear.

3981
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:14,960
A lot.

3982
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:17,210
You ever been to that windmill fields?

3983
01:44:17,211 --> 01:44:22,211
That's like right outside of Los Angeles
going up like we went to Joshua tree at

3984
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,170
night.

3985
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:25,430
She's just thousands of these red dots.

3986
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:28,940
Like I had no idea what it was and I'm
just driving on what the fuck was that?

3987
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:29,390
Holy Shit.

3988
01:44:29,390 --> 01:44:30,060
What is this?

3989
01:44:30,060 --> 01:44:31,520
It done a few fear factory.

3990
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:32,630
That's cool.

3991
01:44:32,630 --> 01:44:33,080
And those,

3992
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:33,411
those,

3993
01:44:33,411 --> 01:44:35,930
those fan things are so
slim that you're like,

3994
01:44:35,931 --> 01:44:36,171
what?

3995
01:44:36,171 --> 01:44:39,380
How does this do anything
small against steel cable.

3996
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:41,180
Fucking wait Brian,

3997
01:44:41,990 --> 01:44:42,980
how does your brain work?

3998
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:46,700
Where we were on a conversation about
nuclear power and stuff and you asked

3999
01:44:46,701 --> 01:44:48,110
about the safety of nuclear power.

4000
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:50,390
How would that be an O'Bryant moment?

4001
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:53,920
We're completely staying
on topic and not making it,

4002
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:57,410
because I was talking about pouring
metal on top of a whole factory,

4003
01:44:57,620 --> 01:45:00,080
locking it down in a big metal box.

4004
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,700
Little toys used to buy when you're a kid,

4005
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:02,511
like does it look cuter?

4006
01:45:02,511 --> 01:45:03,344
Toys like whatever,

4007
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:04,790
whatever that is.

4008
01:45:04,791 --> 01:45:07,190
If you poured like a
billion gallons of oil,

4009
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:10,220
I think the real issue is you
see they can't cool it down.

4010
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:12,460
It's going to take forever to come up.

4011
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:16,280
How's other nuclear plants cool
down the power to cool it down?

4012
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:21,770
A lot of what's going on in a nuclear
power plant is keeping it stable and

4013
01:45:21,771 --> 01:45:24,080
making sure that there's not
what's called a meltdown,

4014
01:45:24,140 --> 01:45:27,200
and I don't understand it enough
to be just talking in vague terms,

4015
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,030
but what happened with Fukushima was the
earthquake and tsunami and flooding and

4016
01:45:32,031 --> 01:45:34,190
everything fucked up
their backup generator,

4017
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,780
so they had nothing,

4018
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:37,460
they had nothing to keep it powered,

4019
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:40,160
so they had essentially eight
hours before there was a meltdown,

4020
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:43,750
so there's eight hours where they
could just evacuate the area,

4021
01:45:43,751 --> 01:45:45,440
and I don't know,

4022
01:45:45,441 --> 01:45:46,131
but I'm sure,

4023
01:45:46,131 --> 01:45:50,960
I mean there's Bonnie's that had been
born with no ears is weird mutants that

4024
01:45:50,961 --> 01:45:52,870
are starting to hear in the apple world,

4025
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:53,630
the fish things,

4026
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:55,080
they're just hanging out with visibility.

4027
01:45:55,270 --> 01:45:58,760
Nonworking eyes just hanging
out front with me and Joe,

4028
01:45:58,761 --> 01:46:01,400
you probably have whatever
we have now in Japan.

4029
01:46:02,970 --> 01:46:03,803
That's like four.

4030
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,360
I was going to not eat
the Sushi over there,

4031
01:46:05,361 --> 01:46:06,290
but it looks so delicious.

4032
01:46:06,291 --> 01:46:06,621
I was like,

4033
01:46:06,621 --> 01:46:07,041
whatever.

4034
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:07,874
Let's let it rock.

4035
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:08,571
Yeah.

4036
01:46:08,571 --> 01:46:10,580
That lasted a half hour.

4037
01:46:10,581 --> 01:46:10,881
I think.

4038
01:46:10,881 --> 01:46:12,860
We were talking about how we
weren't going to eat anything.

4039
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:16,200
I'll just have 12 Sushi.

4040
01:46:16,670 --> 01:46:17,091
Great.

4041
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:18,290
And everybody looked healthy.

4042
01:46:18,530 --> 01:46:19,820
That's not how cancer has.

4043
01:46:19,821 --> 01:46:19,941
No,

4044
01:46:19,941 --> 01:46:20,774
look,

4045
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:22,230
we're a,

4046
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:24,620
we were just talking to you
and I were about mad cow.

4047
01:46:24,621 --> 01:46:27,250
They just found an episode of Tau.

4048
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:28,173
Yeah.

4049
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:30,680
Then they said the only reason I
found it is cause they random testing.

4050
01:46:30,740 --> 01:46:31,580
She's just didn't have,

4051
01:46:31,820 --> 01:46:32,653
didn't have the,

4052
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,310
the symptoms at all.

4053
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:35,270
He wasn't irritable.

4054
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:35,960
Yeah.

4055
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:36,081
No,

4056
01:46:36,081 --> 01:46:37,640
but they said they ha
they act a certain way.

4057
01:46:37,790 --> 01:46:38,001
Dude,

4058
01:46:38,001 --> 01:46:38,661
it's so scary.

4059
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:39,590
They're feeding cows,

4060
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:44,150
cows mad cow disease comes from them
taking cows and then butchering them and

4061
01:46:44,151 --> 01:46:48,320
then grinding up their brain matter
and all sorts of shit and using it for

4062
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,760
protein that they

4063
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,540
feed the other cows.

4064
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,020
I'm mixing them with the grants and cows
aren't supposed to eat cows by the way.

4065
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:56,070
So why are they doing this?

4066
01:46:56,071 --> 01:46:56,970
Really just to save money.

4067
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:57,331
Yes,

4068
01:46:57,331 --> 01:46:57,781
exactly.

4069
01:46:57,781 --> 01:47:00,720
To save money because it
makes us more effective feed.

4070
01:47:00,721 --> 01:47:03,630
You can force the cows to eat that shit
and they will eat it and stay alive and

4071
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:08,100
they get all fat fucked up and they
get essentially what's called Jacob's

4072
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:09,300
crutchfields disease,

4073
01:47:09,301 --> 01:47:14,130
which is the same disease that savages
and cannibals in New Guinea get where

4074
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:14,910
they got the shakes.

4075
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:18,930
They get this terrible neurological
disorder from eating human brain because

4076
01:47:18,931 --> 01:47:20,360
your program can not eat.

4077
01:47:20,430 --> 01:47:21,300
Not supposed to eat that up.

4078
01:47:21,301 --> 01:47:22,134
Exactly.

4079
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,800
It's a fucking trick by nature to
make sure the cannibals don't survive.

4080
01:47:25,801 --> 01:47:27,030
A lion ate human Brian.

4081
01:47:27,031 --> 01:47:27,841
He no problem.

4082
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:28,674
No problem.

4083
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,250
Unless the lion ate a human who
had Jacob's Creutzfeldt disease,

4084
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:37,320
he could get it because he could get it
from what are called prions and that's

4085
01:47:37,321 --> 01:47:41,220
the concern with people eating beef
that came from England during a certain

4086
01:47:41,221 --> 01:47:43,890
period of time when mad cow
disease was running rampant.

4087
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,890
The idea is that you could
have possibly gotten this.

4088
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:49,920
Jacobs had people starts
showing symptoms that ever,

4089
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:50,410
sorry,

4090
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:50,670
glove.

4091
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:50,881
Yeah,

4092
01:47:50,881 --> 01:47:51,061
sure.

4093
01:47:51,061 --> 01:47:52,860
People die from mad cow disease.

4094
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:53,730
And then the joke,

4095
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:55,050
the prime minister of
England was trying to say,

4096
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:57,840
remember that was trying to say it's
safe now switch that a burger to his

4097
01:47:57,841 --> 01:47:58,500
daughter.

4098
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,333
She's,

4099
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:01,200
this is how say how thick it is.

4100
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:02,701
Christ.

4101
01:48:02,701 --> 01:48:03,510
That's crazy.

4102
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:05,160
That's game of Thrones type shit.

4103
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:06,990
Crazy asshole.

4104
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:07,350
It's,

4105
01:48:07,350 --> 01:48:07,861
you know,

4106
01:48:07,861 --> 01:48:11,430
it's amazing that there are so greedy
and Stinky and disgusting that they've

4107
01:48:11,730 --> 01:48:14,160
actually decided that there's
a good way to save money.

4108
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:14,821
Feed cows,

4109
01:48:14,821 --> 01:48:15,654
cows.

4110
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,441
You know what I mean?

4111
01:48:16,441 --> 01:48:18,180
It's just a conti decision.

4112
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:21,380
Just the worst decision when any
company that makes that decision,

4113
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:24,720
the government should come in like storm
troopers and closed their fucking shop

4114
01:48:24,721 --> 01:48:27,510
down and make it a socialist place.

4115
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,520
It should take over and feed the cows.

4116
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,770
Only grass burger cans going to 'em.

4117
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:33,170
That's how bad I feel about it.

4118
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:38,240
To 'em safe chickens and something
else and like like 2017 safe chickens,

4119
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,500
free range range chance.

4120
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:41,221
That's awesome.

4121
01:48:41,221 --> 01:48:43,780
So those are more expensive but maybe,

4122
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:46,800
maybe they're just like financials a
little more on it won't make as much

4123
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,180
definitions of free range.

4124
01:48:48,181 --> 01:48:49,290
I better pretty sloppy.

4125
01:48:49,610 --> 01:48:50,820
But free range is that they don't,

4126
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:51,900
they're not in cages.

4127
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:53,040
They're in a giant pit.

4128
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:54,471
That's probably what it is.

4129
01:48:54,471 --> 01:48:55,950
We're just looks like it's moving.

4130
01:48:56,550 --> 01:48:56,820
Yeah,

4131
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:58,040
that's free range by the way.

4132
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,080
I forgot her and look
through the screen door.

4133
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:03,000
The cats move all at once.

4134
01:49:03,001 --> 01:49:05,820
Sometimes it just looks
like the floor is moving.

4135
01:49:05,821 --> 01:49:07,620
It looks like they're migrating to Diaz.

4136
01:49:07,621 --> 01:49:09,610
Is living in Iraq?

4137
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:10,410
Like birds?

4138
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:10,560
Yeah,

4139
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,790
it's like 12 it's like a
bunch of them have 12 now.

4140
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:14,850
I think it's something like that.

4141
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:16,780
I think an idea cause I went,

4142
01:49:16,781 --> 01:49:21,240
I need to get rid of one of my cats
because it just doesn't work well with my

4143
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:22,950
dog and the other cat hates it too,

4144
01:49:22,951 --> 01:49:24,120
so it's just miserable.

4145
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:25,830
So I want to find like an
old lady to give it to them.

4146
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:29,580
But I was thinking about just like taking
it over to his house and just kind of

4147
01:49:29,581 --> 01:49:30,750
like throwing it into the mix.

4148
01:49:30,780 --> 01:49:33,300
Why don't you pawn it off on
my ex girlfriends they've had,

4149
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:35,100
they've pawned off dogs and cats on you.

4150
01:49:35,340 --> 01:49:36,173
Yeah,

4151
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,230
I should know that's,

4152
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:38,193
that's an old cat.

4153
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:40,010
What about that's what
grandmothers are foreign.

4154
01:49:40,060 --> 01:49:41,550
But unfortunately all my
grandmothers are dead.

4155
01:49:41,551 --> 01:49:46,260
But I used to always give them my cat
like a dictionary and just slam that skull

4156
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:47,350
giving you their cats.

4157
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:48,290
Folk

4158
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:50,200
people need animals.

4159
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:51,313
Yeah.

4160
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:54,070
I think companionship is fucking for sure.

4161
01:49:54,230 --> 01:49:56,710
If anyone in Los Angeles is
old and needs a companion,

4162
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,050
take your old Cathy,

4163
01:49:58,110 --> 01:49:59,020
you're hot shit.

4164
01:49:59,021 --> 01:50:02,410
He'll call me and then I'll see how as
long as I can to live your hope it dies,

4165
01:50:02,411 --> 01:50:02,591
right?

4166
01:50:02,591 --> 01:50:05,460
I think it's like six more
years if you come up going,

4167
01:50:07,060 --> 01:50:07,893
no you're not.

4168
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:09,580
What do you ever hope he dies?

4169
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:10,990
Uh,

4170
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:12,730
I don't hope any animal dies,

4171
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:13,720
but it's sort of,

4172
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:14,723
do you want to be upset?

4173
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:18,980
Is miserable cat right now
and I feel really shitty for,

4174
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:22,210
for even trying to give
it a happy life right now.

4175
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:23,800
Why is it so miserable?

4176
01:50:23,801 --> 01:50:25,030
Because you've got a second cat.

4177
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:28,990
Cause I have a second cat and a dog
and both of them fuck with those two.

4178
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:31,480
Love each other and they're like
a gang and they were just like,

4179
01:50:31,481 --> 01:50:32,770
fuck this other cat.

4180
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:34,570
The other cats,

4181
01:50:34,571 --> 01:50:35,920
they original original line.

4182
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:37,330
And it's like damn bed.

4183
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:39,010
You've created a gang
war in your own house.

4184
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:40,430
Your bullies in your own house.

4185
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:41,283
Yeah.

4186
01:50:41,330 --> 01:50:41,710
It really,

4187
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:44,050
while you're supposed to get rid of the
Ode to supposed to get rid of the cat

4188
01:50:44,051 --> 01:50:44,650
and the dog.

4189
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:44,771
Yeah,

4190
01:50:44,771 --> 01:50:46,000
but they pay me the original.

4191
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:49,030
They pay you or pay me off
cause it was a new attention.

4192
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:50,103
Yeah.

4193
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:50,971
You need that now.

4194
01:50:50,971 --> 01:50:52,090
I know that's my poop.

4195
01:50:52,091 --> 01:50:54,770
So he never poops on and in the in the
house because he just eats it right away.

4196
01:50:54,930 --> 01:50:55,661
A clean it up.

4197
01:50:55,661 --> 01:50:58,240
Don't ask him because it's
going to be something like this.

4198
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,210
He picks up after himself,

4199
01:51:01,211 --> 01:51:02,460
he shits and then eats it back up.

4200
01:51:02,630 --> 01:51:03,463
I never

4201
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:07,210
thought so discussing.

4202
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:07,571
Yeah,

4203
01:51:07,571 --> 01:51:09,880
but he ended up saying
poop up off the floor.

4204
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,470
It's just like you just like,

4205
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:12,580
are you joking around right now?

4206
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:13,710
I hope you are not.

4207
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:17,260
You leave that thing in and it doesn't
have it can't shit so just shits on the

4208
01:51:17,261 --> 01:51:20,380
ground poop pad and it needs its own shit.

4209
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:20,950
Huh?

4210
01:51:20,950 --> 01:51:21,670
Indeed Sasha,

4211
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:23,040
it loves its own shit.

4212
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:24,890
Shit.

4213
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:27,530
A peed of a dog but does not eat.

4214
01:51:27,531 --> 01:51:29,410
It's a lot like all of
it or just look at it.

4215
01:51:29,411 --> 01:51:32,000
You want to look at it or is it all of it?

4216
01:51:32,050 --> 01:51:34,360
Every time I come down and it
looks like he ate a nice cookie,

4217
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:37,270
there's little crumbs of his own dude.

4218
01:51:37,271 --> 01:51:37,710
How?

4219
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:38,210
How was not?

4220
01:51:38,210 --> 01:51:42,580
Not Incredibly disgusting to you
because I haven't gone out of his mouth.

4221
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:46,560
I put Listerine strips
in his mouth and I don't.

4222
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:47,810
I put no,

4223
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:48,643
I have to stop.

4224
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:52,930
I have this dog spray stuff for dog
breath or we saved this conversation.

4225
01:51:53,970 --> 01:51:55,340
Are you addition processor?

4226
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:59,390
If I can't allegedly allegedly
apps to find out where I am,

4227
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,520
what part of the world,

4228
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:04,120
if I do Mondays for just for Comedians,

4229
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:07,120
when I block out of an
amount of time like that,

4230
01:52:07,121 --> 01:52:09,040
it's very selfish because I'm a father.

4231
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:12,190
I could smoke pot and be functional,

4232
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:14,650
but I have to be real
particular about like where I,

4233
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:15,890
where I do shrooms

4234
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:18,520
work.

4235
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:19,700
I tell you the last time I did it,

4236
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:19,871
man,

4237
01:52:19,871 --> 01:52:22,780
I was convinced I'm never going
to do this shit ever again.

4238
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:24,610
Well,

4239
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:29,470
I've done it since I was a young person
and then I stopped for seven years and

4240
01:52:29,471 --> 01:52:31,840
then I always thought in that
seven year time I'm like,

4241
01:52:31,841 --> 01:52:32,620
you know what?

4242
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:34,810
I've done everything I
needed to do at that.

4243
01:52:34,811 --> 01:52:35,740
That's stupid.

4244
01:52:35,741 --> 01:52:36,580
Now I need.

4245
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:40,120
But then I started dating younger girls
and then I had to re go through all

4246
01:52:40,121 --> 01:52:44,170
their drug experiences and now I'm back
into how I was when I was 21 again,

4247
01:52:44,470 --> 01:52:45,350
I think it's,

4248
01:52:45,351 --> 01:52:45,770
uh,

4249
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:46,010
it's

4250
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,270
all about the intent.

4251
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,630
Like what are you trying to accomplish
that are using it or you're trying to

4252
01:52:50,631 --> 01:52:52,070
find something out about yourself.

4253
01:52:52,100 --> 01:52:57,100
Are you trying to have like a spiritual
journey that you go on or are you just

4254
01:52:57,711 --> 01:53:01,220
trying to play and party
and get fucked up and say,

4255
01:53:01,221 --> 01:53:01,330
oh,

4256
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:02,210
I can't believe what I took?

4257
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:02,511
Well,

4258
01:53:02,511 --> 01:53:06,530
I took so much because I think a lot of
times when you do that and he don't go

4259
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:08,660
into a trip like you can,

4260
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:12,230
you could take a mushroom trip for
granted and a mushroom trip can kick your

4261
01:53:12,231 --> 01:53:13,080
fucking ass.

4262
01:53:13,081 --> 01:53:13,220
Yeah.

4263
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:14,450
I think it'd be just fun too though.

4264
01:53:14,500 --> 01:53:15,250
Sure.

4265
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:16,120
If you're an old state,

4266
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,010
go to like a concert.

4267
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:19,393
The quantity,

4268
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:20,610
quantity,

4269
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:21,411
UAA food,

4270
01:53:21,411 --> 01:53:22,160
how much food you ate,

4271
01:53:22,160 --> 01:53:23,930
the quantity and who you're with,

4272
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:26,090
where your state of mind you
want to be with people you love.

4273
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:26,690
Yeah.

4274
01:53:26,690 --> 01:53:27,021
Yeah.

4275
01:53:27,021 --> 01:53:28,850
And you can get away with doing mushrooms,

4276
01:53:28,851 --> 01:53:29,331
but the,

4277
01:53:29,331 --> 01:53:31,310
when you do big doses like you did,

4278
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:32,660
you did a giant dose.

4279
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:34,960
I firmly believe that
you should last time,

4280
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:38,360
be prepared for a fucking
journey through space.

4281
01:53:38,510 --> 01:53:39,141
When you do that,

4282
01:53:39,141 --> 01:53:39,291
I mean,

4283
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:41,690
you should be someone who's
been going to yoga class.

4284
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:42,883
You should be selling anything.

4285
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:43,611
Sit down.

4286
01:53:43,611 --> 01:53:44,030
I think that's,

4287
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:45,620
I think that's an
overdose on mountain like,

4288
01:53:45,630 --> 01:53:45,950
well,

4289
01:53:45,950 --> 01:53:47,540
there is such thing as overdose amount,

4290
01:53:47,541 --> 01:53:48,374
meaning

4291
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:50,243
the rats,

4292
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:53,000
the body immediately rejects any of it.

4293
01:53:53,230 --> 01:53:54,080
Like a small amount.

4294
01:53:54,340 --> 01:53:55,040
That's what an overdose.

4295
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:55,761
It's like your body is like,

4296
01:53:55,761 --> 01:53:56,210
no,

4297
01:53:56,210 --> 01:53:56,690
no.

4298
01:53:56,690 --> 01:53:58,130
Get this out of an overdose.

4299
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:59,750
You're reacting to that,

4300
01:53:59,751 --> 01:54:00,584
to that stuff.

4301
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:03,310
This thing about mushrooms
is it's not poison.

4302
01:54:03,311 --> 01:54:04,220
It's what's going to,

4303
01:54:04,221 --> 01:54:05,150
Jackie was like,

4304
01:54:05,180 --> 01:54:06,600
it's like saying salt as poison.

4305
01:54:06,601 --> 01:54:07,431
Salt doesn't poison,

4306
01:54:07,431 --> 01:54:08,390
but if you had a pound of it,

4307
01:54:08,391 --> 01:54:09,190
you're fucking dead.

4308
01:54:09,190 --> 01:54:09,860
It's the warm,

4309
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,041
yeah.

4310
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:11,750
Mushrooms are the,

4311
01:54:11,751 --> 01:54:12,081
the,

4312
01:54:12,081 --> 01:54:14,330
the act of psychoactive
ingredients and mushrooms.

4313
01:54:14,331 --> 01:54:14,451
They,

4314
01:54:14,451 --> 01:54:16,160
it mimics human neuro chemistry.

4315
01:54:16,161 --> 01:54:18,640
That's why it's so
powerful with mushrooms is,

4316
01:54:18,641 --> 01:54:19,474
is like for,

4317
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:20,470
with silicide bananas,

4318
01:54:20,500 --> 01:54:21,710
I don't know how to say it exactly,

4319
01:54:21,711 --> 01:54:23,180
but something like four phosphoryl,

4320
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:24,460
oxy and,

4321
01:54:24,461 --> 01:54:28,430
and dimethyltryptamine
and dimethyltryptamine is
actually made by the human

4322
01:54:28,431 --> 01:54:28,761
brain.

4323
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:30,950
So it's die methyl trip to
me and plus something else.

4324
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:35,600
And it's some weird phosphorus something
or another molecule attached to it

4325
01:54:35,601 --> 01:54:36,860
somehow or another that
makes it different.

4326
01:54:36,861 --> 01:54:37,694
But whatever it is,

4327
01:54:37,730 --> 01:54:39,620
it's so close to human neuro chemistry.

4328
01:54:39,621 --> 01:54:40,970
It's not really a poison.

4329
01:54:41,210 --> 01:54:45,080
It's just some weird fucking side
venture that you can take your mind on.

4330
01:54:45,410 --> 01:54:49,580
So the danger is only in
like spectacular doses to,

4331
01:54:49,590 --> 01:54:53,060
to actually worry about poisoning
yourself to the three grams are fine.

4332
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:53,760
Yeah.

4333
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:54,500
You could take,

4334
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,430
you could take a lot.

4335
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:55,731
I mean,

4336
01:54:55,731 --> 01:54:59,900
I know many people that
the five and 10 grams,

4337
01:54:59,901 --> 01:55:03,320
I've heard two grams from many
different people and they are fine.

4338
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:03,651
I mean,

4339
01:55:03,651 --> 01:55:05,450
there's scared as fuck.

4340
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,500
And when they come out of it,

4341
01:55:06,501 --> 01:55:09,860
I mean they shot through the middle of
the fucking rabbit hole and came back

4342
01:55:09,861 --> 01:55:11,450
with Robert Lewis cat.

4343
01:55:11,451 --> 01:55:11,730
What does,

4344
01:55:11,730 --> 01:55:12,830
what does the guys about what you did?

4345
01:55:13,070 --> 01:55:13,903
10 grams.

4346
01:55:14,590 --> 01:55:15,680
That's about 10 groups.

4347
01:55:15,681 --> 01:55:15,920
Yeah.

4348
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:16,850
Robert Louis Stevenson.

4349
01:55:17,590 --> 01:55:18,260
Yeah.

4350
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:19,400
Is he the one who wrote um,

4351
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:20,301
Alice in wonderland,

4352
01:55:20,301 --> 01:55:21,021
which she wrote with this.

4353
01:55:21,021 --> 01:55:21,791
Let's just go with it.

4354
01:55:21,791 --> 01:55:23,210
Cause it wasn't like Lewis Carroll though,

4355
01:55:23,211 --> 01:55:23,550
isn't it?

4356
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:28,550
Was Carol's Carol Lewis Carroll
multiply that times a middle ship.

4357
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:30,130
I mean all that stuff was,

4358
01:55:30,450 --> 01:55:32,270
that was all psychedelic inspired.

4359
01:55:32,271 --> 01:55:33,290
I'm sure all of his,

4360
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:35,960
I mean it wasn't it supposed to be
about assets supposed to be about that.

4361
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:36,680
Yeah,

4362
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:37,071
you could,

4363
01:55:37,071 --> 01:55:40,010
you could take enough mushrooms that you
could fucking lose your mind for sure.

4364
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,451
I'm just super,

4365
01:55:41,451 --> 01:55:42,250
super hot.

4366
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:44,040
No one has listening to this is going

4367
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:44,873
to take that much.

4368
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:45,300
I,

4369
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:46,320
my legs do not work.

4370
01:55:46,321 --> 01:55:47,400
I fell to the ground.

4371
01:55:47,401 --> 01:55:48,000
Legs don't work.

4372
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,560
I thought as he's walking down the street,

4373
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:51,660
my legs didn't work.

4374
01:55:51,670 --> 01:55:54,630
I mean like I fell to the
ground and I could not stand up.

4375
01:55:55,370 --> 01:55:57,660
It's not a good example
for the youth of America.

4376
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:57,961
No,

4377
01:55:57,961 --> 01:55:59,480
and I don't think that's anything that is,

4378
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:03,090
people should try it unless they done
the research and make sure they're safe.

4379
01:56:03,091 --> 01:56:04,620
And I was talking about age.

4380
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:05,071
What's that?

4381
01:56:05,071 --> 01:56:05,904
That was 10 grams.

4382
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:06,773
That was that.

4383
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:09,630
That was when I took a
quarter in an eighth.

4384
01:56:09,631 --> 01:56:10,464
Whatever that is.

4385
01:56:11,970 --> 01:56:12,803
Whoa.

4386
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:15,793
Whoa.

4387
01:56:25,270 --> 01:56:26,260
The youth of America.

4388
01:56:26,261 --> 01:56:27,730
And they deserve better than that.

4389
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:28,564
Brian,

4390
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:29,860
you're a leader at this point.

4391
01:56:29,861 --> 01:56:30,940
I think you need to step up.

4392
01:56:31,510 --> 01:56:32,200
I'll have it on here.

4393
01:56:32,200 --> 01:56:32,830
Don't do it.

4394
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:34,180
Stop having your legs fall apart,

4395
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:35,053
son.

4396
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:36,880
How many grams you think you did?

4397
01:56:36,970 --> 01:56:38,740
What you had this spectacular trip?

4398
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:39,191
10.

4399
01:56:39,191 --> 01:56:40,120
It's [inaudible].

4400
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:41,141
That's what it comes out to.

4401
01:56:41,141 --> 01:56:41,530
10,

4402
01:56:41,530 --> 01:56:42,220
10 to 11.

4403
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:43,053
10 to 11 grounds.

4404
01:56:43,770 --> 01:56:44,590
So crazy.

4405
01:56:44,590 --> 01:56:46,600
What was the most memorable part of it?

4406
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:47,980
Uh,

4407
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:49,420
my hand turning into pyramids.

4408
01:56:49,421 --> 01:56:50,410
Gold Pyramids.

4409
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:50,870
Wow.

4410
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:51,703
Nice.

4411
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:52,330
Uh,

4412
01:56:52,330 --> 01:56:57,330
when I puked it was all colors and it
turned into trees and it like felt like

4413
01:56:58,781 --> 01:57:00,910
there was trees going
in my mouth and stuff.

4414
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:03,280
And then three is going into your mouth.

4415
01:57:03,281 --> 01:57:04,090
The wow.

4416
01:57:04,090 --> 01:57:07,750
The walls are made it like at a Lego's
and they were just falling down and wow.

4417
01:57:08,440 --> 01:57:09,350
It was fucking crazy.

4418
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:10,540
I know it's sick.

4419
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:10,821
I now,

4420
01:57:10,821 --> 01:57:11,770
what thoughts did you have?

4421
01:57:11,770 --> 01:57:12,760
All this was going on.

4422
01:57:12,980 --> 01:57:13,330
Uh,

4423
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:13,871
olive garden.

4424
01:57:13,871 --> 01:57:14,800
I ate too much.

4425
01:57:14,801 --> 01:57:15,640
I would poison.

4426
01:57:15,641 --> 01:57:17,200
Why aren't my legs working?

4427
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:18,063
I'm puking.

4428
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:19,290
Here's what I tell.

4429
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:20,140
I wasn't really paranoid.

4430
01:57:20,141 --> 01:57:23,080
It was more like something I've
never had my legs never work.

4431
01:57:23,081 --> 01:57:23,914
I've never had bought,

4432
01:57:23,980 --> 01:57:28,540
like I've trimmed off 100 times plus
and I've never had it where like my body

4433
01:57:28,541 --> 01:57:29,200
wouldn't work.

4434
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:32,230
So you were just so bunkered out that
you literally couldn't figure out how to

4435
01:57:32,231 --> 01:57:33,670
use things I guess.

4436
01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:34,830
I mean I,

4437
01:57:34,830 --> 01:57:38,850
I I recorded myself and I
talked like I was fine and,

4438
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:40,300
and uh,

4439
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,151
and I,

4440
01:57:41,151 --> 01:57:42,430
I felt like I knew what was going on,

4441
01:57:42,431 --> 01:57:43,181
but it was more of like,

4442
01:57:43,181 --> 01:57:44,470
I felt like a poisoned.

4443
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:47,350
What's like the best thing
you ever learned from a trip?

4444
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:48,040
What does,

4445
01:57:48,040 --> 01:57:52,390
what have you ever come out of a trip
and had like this is like a real solid

4446
01:57:52,391 --> 01:57:53,224
revelation.

4447
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:57,910
I always have revelations
every single time.

4448
01:57:57,911 --> 01:57:59,650
Like the last one I did,

4449
01:57:59,710 --> 01:58:00,310
um,

4450
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:01,390
which was,

4451
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:01,811
uh,

4452
01:58:01,811 --> 01:58:05,260
I did an a shitty hotel room and I did a
whole podcast with the other girl I did

4453
01:58:05,261 --> 01:58:06,910
it with and it's on death squad,

4454
01:58:06,911 --> 01:58:08,440
but I will help people find it.

4455
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:08,801
Uh,

4456
01:58:08,801 --> 01:58:11,020
it's just go there and type in,

4457
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:11,470
um,

4458
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:13,850
it's on the front page of
death squad.tv and it's like,

4459
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:14,591
but for now,

4460
01:58:14,591 --> 01:58:17,680
people that people might be listening
to this a hundred years from now.

4461
01:58:17,710 --> 01:58:18,041
Okay.

4462
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:18,371
Hold on.

4463
01:58:18,371 --> 01:58:19,031
I'll tell you in a sec.

4464
01:58:19,031 --> 01:58:19,510
One Toe.

4465
01:58:19,510 --> 01:58:20,081
I doubt it,

4466
01:58:20,081 --> 01:58:20,914
but uh,

4467
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:25,960
hopefully it sounds something
cooler than I phones or Ipods,

4468
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:26,800
but quite,

4469
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:27,633
I did it with my,

4470
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:28,091
her name,

4471
01:58:28,091 --> 01:58:28,570
what's her name?

4472
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:29,351
I did it with my,

4473
01:58:29,351 --> 01:58:32,230
a friend friend Pamela
Wall and Emmy Hawthorne.

4474
01:58:32,231 --> 01:58:33,490
And we just went to this really,

4475
01:58:33,491 --> 01:58:33,911
really,

4476
01:58:33,911 --> 01:58:34,541
really,

4477
01:58:34,541 --> 01:58:37,390
really shitty hotel in
a really scary place.

4478
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:38,500
What's the name of it?

4479
01:58:38,590 --> 01:58:39,610
A motel six.

4480
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:40,181
No,

4481
01:58:40,181 --> 01:58:41,430
may mean the podcasts.

4482
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:42,020
I just

4483
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:42,520
wanna look at that.

4484
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,390
I would advise against,

4485
01:58:43,391 --> 01:58:43,761
by the way,

4486
01:58:43,761 --> 01:58:45,790
I could go into a place that's
like a shitty environment.

4487
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:47,710
Death Squad number 18.

4488
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:49,400
And so then who are the people on it?

4489
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,610
It's just me and Pamela Walt just did the,

4490
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:52,503
we did our,

4491
01:58:52,510 --> 01:58:53,260
cause she had,

4492
01:58:53,260 --> 01:58:56,290
it was her first time
doing mushrooms and she,

4493
01:58:56,291 --> 01:58:56,501
you know,

4494
01:58:56,501 --> 01:58:57,340
had got,

4495
01:58:57,341 --> 01:59:00,640
just got over having cancer and Oh crotch.

4496
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,320
And she's homeless,

4497
01:59:02,321 --> 01:59:02,501
you know,

4498
01:59:02,501 --> 01:59:02,861
she,

4499
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:04,600
she goes from couch to couch,

4500
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:05,080
you know,

4501
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,060
she just has had so much,

4502
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:08,590
most of her life.

4503
01:59:08,591 --> 01:59:10,150
She had such bad s uh,

4504
01:59:10,210 --> 01:59:12,970
social anxiety that she would
never even talk to anyone.

4505
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:16,300
And then recently she started getting
better with the help of actually had

4506
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:16,871
Adderall it,

4507
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:17,531
believe it or not.

4508
01:59:17,531 --> 01:59:17,890
Well,

4509
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:18,280
uh,

4510
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:19,061
and uh,

4511
01:59:19,061 --> 01:59:22,000
so now she's actually being able
to function and talk to people,

4512
01:59:22,001 --> 01:59:23,320
which is something that she,

4513
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:25,870
it's like being reborn as an adult.

4514
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:27,453
Um,

4515
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:29,410
she had the most fabulous,

4516
01:59:29,411 --> 01:59:30,430
wonderful time.

4517
01:59:30,431 --> 01:59:30,791
She,

4518
01:59:30,791 --> 01:59:35,500
she found all this things and it
was just the most ideal thing ever.

4519
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:37,300
And it's like in a Shitty,

4520
01:59:37,301 --> 01:59:37,541
shitty,

4521
01:59:37,541 --> 01:59:38,390
shitty situation.

4522
01:59:38,410 --> 01:59:40,060
Amazing how the same stuff,

4523
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:42,100
the same batch of the same drug.

4524
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:43,270
It's not like you've got a bad batch.

4525
01:59:43,271 --> 01:59:45,500
Just some people have a good trip and
every once in a while somebody is a bad

4526
01:59:45,501 --> 01:59:45,700
trip.

4527
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:46,840
I think a lot of it is going,

4528
01:59:46,841 --> 01:59:47,830
what's going on in your head?

4529
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:52,860
Because there's with people in times in
my life where I was teetering on a bad

4530
01:59:53,111 --> 01:59:53,944
state of mind,

4531
01:59:55,130 --> 01:59:56,440
but if you listen to the thing,

4532
01:59:56,470 --> 02:00:00,940
if there was a reason I was forced into
this bad situation because I went from

4533
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:04,900
being like all right this like
we might get shot at this hotel,

4534
02:00:04,901 --> 02:00:08,980
this hotel is actually a place that
you'd go to do drugs and get hookers.

4535
02:00:09,100 --> 02:00:12,400
Like there's people living there and
we explain this whole thing in detail.

4536
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:15,520
So I ate it and then immediately
started realizing like,

4537
02:00:15,521 --> 02:00:16,354
wait a second,

4538
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:19,390
we don't want to be here for
six hours trapped in this room.

4539
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:23,220
I need to be a babysitter because this
might be really bad at something like

4540
02:00:23,230 --> 02:00:25,570
fear and loathing in the
middle of the desert type shit.

4541
02:00:25,840 --> 02:00:28,060
That's funny dude.

4542
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:31,780
You should to write about that and that
should be part of your act on stage.

4543
02:00:32,410 --> 02:00:33,460
I need to figure it out.

4544
02:00:33,461 --> 02:00:35,110
That's a funny idea for a bit,

4545
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:35,800
dude.

4546
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:37,750
Getting fucked up on
mushrooms in the wrong hotel.

4547
02:00:38,540 --> 02:00:40,870
It was bad cause like every time I
wanted it to go have a cigarette,

4548
02:00:40,871 --> 02:00:41,710
I had to go outside.

4549
02:00:41,711 --> 02:00:44,140
And one time there was like this black
dude that right there was like running

4550
02:00:44,141 --> 02:00:44,740
really fast.

4551
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:47,200
Then he hid behind a wall and you
look out and he looked right at me.

4552
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:47,440
I'm like,

4553
02:00:47,440 --> 02:00:47,921
Oh shit.

4554
02:00:47,921 --> 02:00:48,461
I saw him.

4555
02:00:48,461 --> 02:00:50,260
And then he started
running as fast as he can.

4556
02:00:50,270 --> 02:00:53,260
Like he was absolutely hiding from
something neighborhood was uh,

4557
02:00:53,380 --> 02:00:55,210
it was in this weird place in Ventura.

4558
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:56,800
It was really bad.

4559
02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:58,420
Maybe he was on mushrooms maybe,

4560
02:00:58,750 --> 02:00:59,021
but,

4561
02:00:59,021 --> 02:00:59,830
but uh,

4562
02:00:59,830 --> 02:01:02,980
but I would go out and have a cigarette
and I started like I had this a cell

4563
02:01:02,981 --> 02:01:03,431
phone case.

4564
02:01:03,431 --> 02:01:04,750
It had all these little diamonds on it,

4565
02:01:04,980 --> 02:01:07,630
kind of like these little
gems self yet be dazzled.

4566
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:10,000
And so I started like
leaving them everywhere.

4567
02:01:10,001 --> 02:01:14,110
I would walk just so I would have
a place if they have to find me.

4568
02:01:14,380 --> 02:01:18,010
There was like I was doing read their
mind can definitely want her to on a bad

4569
02:01:18,011 --> 02:01:21,130
situation where it makes it seem
way worse while you're mushroom.

4570
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,950
And then there was a fire alarm
outside of our door and I'm like,

4571
02:01:24,010 --> 02:01:25,570
that's the emergency thing.

4572
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:26,800
If anything happens,

4573
02:01:26,801 --> 02:01:28,140
if we get robbed or stuff,

4574
02:01:28,190 --> 02:01:31,900
it's something I'm pulling that
that's how scary this hotel was,

4575
02:01:31,901 --> 02:01:34,090
but I made myself puke
but it was too late.

4576
02:01:34,210 --> 02:01:37,510
I would think it'd be so fun if you
grab that and pull it and it's silence.

4577
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:38,260
No,

4578
02:01:38,260 --> 02:01:39,100
it just falls off.

4579
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:40,320
There's drugs and the claim

4580
02:01:40,470 --> 02:01:41,300
cooking happens on us,

4581
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:42,860
but you got to do that
within the first 30 minutes.

4582
02:01:43,240 --> 02:01:46,490
I tried to and it was the only time I've
never heard a tripping out 30 minutes

4583
02:01:46,491 --> 02:01:47,324
in that heart.

4584
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:49,580
I hadn't eaten the whole
day or the night before.

4585
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:54,410
I actually had my finger down my throat
and never have done that successfully in

4586
02:01:54,411 --> 02:01:56,870
my whole entire life and
made myself puke it up.

4587
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:58,350
I got to pee and I start tripping.

4588
02:01:58,390 --> 02:01:59,690
How long into this was,

4589
02:01:59,840 --> 02:02:01,070
it was about 30 minutes.

4590
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:03,400
If you've just started
shipping afterwards,

4591
02:02:03,401 --> 02:02:04,370
why did you make yourself throw up?

4592
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:05,391
No,

4593
02:02:05,391 --> 02:02:06,770
it was happening while I was puking.

4594
02:02:06,771 --> 02:02:10,100
I saw that stuff where you started feeling
like terrible and stuff was happening

4595
02:02:10,101 --> 02:02:10,370
before.

4596
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:11,630
Like as you sort of just was a different,

4597
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:12,560
this is my latest trip.

4598
02:02:12,561 --> 02:02:12,800
We went,

4599
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,760
I turned to my hotel room,

4600
02:02:14,070 --> 02:02:16,520
I just win after I ate,

4601
02:02:16,521 --> 02:02:18,590
I started noticing like
how bad his hotel was.

4602
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:23,180
Like we opened up the sheets and there
was like a fucking mess shit in there and

4603
02:02:23,181 --> 02:02:27,380
there was like a stain that was on
each side of the sheets and and yeah.

4604
02:02:27,381 --> 02:02:29,900
And then just people
offside that were like,

4605
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:30,980
it was scary.

4606
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,170
Like the cops came at one
point in the busted up.

4607
02:02:33,171 --> 02:02:36,140
This huge cops are good to see when
you're on mushrooms even though they can't

4608
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:36,351
tell,

4609
02:02:36,351 --> 02:02:36,881
they don't know anything.

4610
02:02:36,881 --> 02:02:38,180
They just still like good cops.

4611
02:02:38,190 --> 02:02:38,901
This is weird.

4612
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:39,810
This makes a bad thing.

4613
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:41,810
When Pam was checking into the hotel,

4614
02:02:41,811 --> 02:02:44,360
somebody crashed through
the office in their car.

4615
02:02:44,510 --> 02:02:45,410
Why don't you go to there?

4616
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:46,280
Uh,

4617
02:02:46,280 --> 02:02:47,210
I didn't go there.

4618
02:02:47,211 --> 02:02:50,930
I met them there and then I ran up
to the room thinking oh this is cool.

4619
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:53,960
And then right after I eat cause I
was trying to catch up cause they were

4620
02:02:53,961 --> 02:02:54,240
already,

4621
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:56,990
somebody crashed through the window
with their car when they checked in to

4622
02:02:56,991 --> 02:02:58,880
somebody crashed the car into the office.

4623
02:02:59,300 --> 02:03:00,930
So like the wall was broken open and like,

4624
02:03:00,931 --> 02:03:02,650
Oh yeah and you'll look dumb.

4625
02:03:02,660 --> 02:03:02,901
Okay,

4626
02:03:02,901 --> 02:03:04,140
here's my credit card information.

4627
02:03:04,170 --> 02:03:05,003
This is,

4628
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:05,841
I didn't do it.

4629
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:06,950
But yeah it was,

4630
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:07,900
it was uh,

4631
02:03:08,210 --> 02:03:12,050
it was a showroom of hell April while
she was having the same exact opposite.

4632
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:12,884
So it's interesting.

4633
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:16,210
We just talked for like two hours about
you can let yourself get in a bad place.

4634
02:03:16,240 --> 02:03:19,290
My friend took it once with a girl with
a god he's barely knew and a girl he

4635
02:03:19,291 --> 02:03:22,550
sort of liked and it was just one of the
worst trips for him because he said it

4636
02:03:22,551 --> 02:03:25,700
was like he was worried about his behavior
in front of certain people and not

4637
02:03:25,701 --> 02:03:27,500
worrying puts you in a bad position.

4638
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:28,220
Yeah.

4639
02:03:28,220 --> 02:03:29,570
That's one of the things about ecstasy.

4640
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:30,261
That's so cool.

4641
02:03:30,261 --> 02:03:32,900
You can do it with anybody or you
just feel like you'd like everybody.

4642
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:33,111
Yeah.

4643
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:34,010
Released everything.

4644
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:36,430
I still think that's the best
drag in the whole entire ride.

4645
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,780
I had to choose one drug other than weed.

4646
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:40,213
Yeah.

4647
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:41,001
Like I said,

4648
02:03:41,001 --> 02:03:44,210
I love the experience with the
comedown was fucking brutal.

4649
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:45,501
It was brutal.

4650
02:03:45,501 --> 02:03:46,400
I took two pills.

4651
02:03:46,401 --> 02:03:47,330
I don't know what the milligrams,

4652
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:49,200
where I am today.

4653
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:51,560
The next day I was wrecked.

4654
02:03:52,140 --> 02:03:53,320
All sort of the same milligrams.

4655
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:53,690
Right.

4656
02:03:53,690 --> 02:03:54,523
They're just different.

4657
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:55,610
I seen the guy once,

4658
02:03:55,650 --> 02:03:56,730
I'm going to take nine.

4659
02:03:56,930 --> 02:03:57,890
Oh my God.

4660
02:03:57,891 --> 02:03:58,730
I don't know.

4661
02:03:59,080 --> 02:03:59,241
Yeah,

4662
02:03:59,241 --> 02:04:02,240
those are the same people that like long
time ago when police do acid and they'd

4663
02:04:02,241 --> 02:04:02,421
be like,

4664
02:04:02,421 --> 02:04:02,661
dude,

4665
02:04:02,661 --> 02:04:04,230
I just did 12 hits of acid.

4666
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:05,083
I'm like,

4667
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:06,950
why would you do well there's,

4668
02:04:06,951 --> 02:04:09,440
there's certain dudes like James Cameron
and want to go to the bottom of the

4669
02:04:09,441 --> 02:04:09,910
ocean.

4670
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:10,040
See,

4671
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:10,940
this guy wants to just go,

4672
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:14,000
so some dudes just want
to go to the bottom.

4673
02:04:14,390 --> 02:04:15,141
I saw one of these,

4674
02:04:15,141 --> 02:04:16,510
UFC is one of talks to

4675
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:20,530
some pop pills or something and there
was one colleague rude was fighting.

4676
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:21,920
I got so fucking into it

4677
02:04:24,470 --> 02:04:26,230
on the floor areas.

4678
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:27,440
We figured this out later,

4679
02:04:27,441 --> 02:04:28,730
like years later there was,

4680
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:33,760
we went to a UFC once and
he was so emotional and like
screaming as long as mom.

4681
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,500
And then he told me just like
a couple months ago goes,

4682
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:38,130
oh yeah,

4683
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,000
I never told you this,

4684
02:04:39,001 --> 02:04:40,730
but I was on whatever you just said.

4685
02:04:40,750 --> 02:04:41,700
This is a good pop pills.

4686
02:04:42,690 --> 02:04:45,300
Best Mari now are a Ufo.

4687
02:04:45,330 --> 02:04:45,871
Ari,

4688
02:04:45,871 --> 02:04:47,700
a UFC moment is documented.

4689
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:48,571
It's when,

4690
02:04:48,571 --> 02:04:49,140
uh,

4691
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:49,973
um,

4692
02:04:50,610 --> 02:04:51,750
what the fuck is his name?

4693
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:53,280
It was a in Brazil,

4694
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:54,780
in Brazil.

4695
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:55,740
Oh God.

4696
02:04:55,880 --> 02:04:57,480
That was Edom.

4697
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:00,000
Got Wheel kicked in the
head by Edson Barboza.

4698
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:05,270
Edson Barboza cracked him with this
wheel kick and as he's going down you and

4699
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:09,180
Joe Silva right there and you like
put your hands on your head like,

4700
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:12,300
Holy Shit fucked my head up my mouth.

4701
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:12,511
Like,

4702
02:05:12,511 --> 02:05:13,344
oh no,

4703
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:14,490
that's so brutal.

4704
02:05:14,550 --> 02:05:17,010
Ari was like right over my right shoulder.

4705
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:17,701
Like where I'm sitting,

4706
02:05:17,701 --> 02:05:20,100
I'm sitting like right at the
cage and Ari's right behind me.

4707
02:05:20,101 --> 02:05:22,570
So if you look at like the
animated gifs are online,

4708
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:26,010
you can see are we pop up
as a super slow motion.

4709
02:05:26,011 --> 02:05:28,960
When I thought it was like really
cool to see it happening super slowly,

4710
02:05:29,260 --> 02:05:31,770
slowly up before he hits the ground.

4711
02:05:32,130 --> 02:05:33,240
I don't care what anybody says.

4712
02:05:33,241 --> 02:05:37,080
Dad is the greatest job I
have ever figured out how to,

4713
02:05:37,081 --> 02:05:39,750
I don't know how the fuck I ever
got a job working for the UFC.

4714
02:05:39,930 --> 02:05:41,430
But that is the greatest job ever.

4715
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:43,380
It's so crazy.

4716
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:44,910
Nuts.

4717
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:48,150
Brazil was insane to be able
to be there right there.

4718
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:49,013
Ringside.

4719
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:49,883
I've seen like,

4720
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:51,540
like more than a thousand.

4721
02:05:51,541 --> 02:05:52,620
Great fights like that.

4722
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:53,940
It's really incredible.

4723
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:54,571
You know?

4724
02:05:54,571 --> 02:05:55,890
And then for you in Brazil,

4725
02:05:55,891 --> 02:05:59,230
you were right there with me and the
stage 18,000 people fucking screen.

4726
02:05:59,231 --> 02:06:01,260
And you've never seen a
crowd like a Brazilian crowd,

4727
02:06:01,261 --> 02:06:01,950
man.

4728
02:06:01,950 --> 02:06:06,350
Anybody who thinks that
American crowds are loyal or no,

4729
02:06:06,830 --> 02:06:07,760
just screaming.

4730
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:09,840
Usa Boxing Guy Trains in England.

4731
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:11,150
Who's cream?

4732
02:06:11,150 --> 02:06:12,120
USA to the other one.

4733
02:06:12,210 --> 02:06:12,451
Yeah,

4734
02:06:12,451 --> 02:06:13,500
we scream USA.

4735
02:06:13,530 --> 02:06:14,440
But that's about it.

4736
02:06:14,441 --> 02:06:16,050
And in Brazil they scream,

4737
02:06:16,051 --> 02:06:17,010
you're going to die.

4738
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:17,903
You're gonna die.

4739
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:19,403
You're gonna die.

4740
02:06:19,470 --> 02:06:20,610
And then when Mike Pyle,

4741
02:06:20,611 --> 02:06:23,520
Mike Pyle won his fight
against this Brazilian dude,

4742
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:25,800
only numbers Brazilian
or one against Funche.

4743
02:06:26,010 --> 02:06:27,360
And when he won,

4744
02:06:27,361 --> 02:06:32,361
the fucking whole crown is calling him
a fag crowd Portuguese there to the,

4745
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:34,050
to the,

4746
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:34,860
to the translator.

4747
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:35,520
Like what are they saying?

4748
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,450
What are they selling right now?

4749
02:06:36,620 --> 02:06:38,580
But she thought they were
saying a different word.

4750
02:06:38,581 --> 02:06:39,330
It turns out there were,

4751
02:06:39,330 --> 02:06:42,180
she thought they were saying she
gone know which is junior dos Santos,

4752
02:06:42,181 --> 02:06:43,014
his nickname.

4753
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:47,190
They were saying it's like fig I know or
something along those lines which just

4754
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:48,073
faggot.

4755
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:51,660
It's unfortunate that Anderson Silva
and Chael Sonnen and aren't going to be

4756
02:06:51,661 --> 02:06:52,500
fighting in Brazil.

4757
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:56,520
There was apparently we're going to
do it at the giant soccer stadium,

4758
02:06:56,521 --> 02:06:58,230
which is going to be 80,000 people.

4759
02:06:58,380 --> 02:07:03,300
But there was a UN meeting that was
going on there the two days before.

4760
02:07:03,301 --> 02:07:05,010
So there would've been no hotel rooms.

4761
02:07:05,011 --> 02:07:08,700
It would have been a nightmare because
you'd have to bring in 80,000 people from

4762
02:07:08,701 --> 02:07:12,870
other parts of Brazil in the world want
to come in and fly in to see that fight.

4763
02:07:12,870 --> 02:07:14,580
So it was way too nutty.

4764
02:07:14,581 --> 02:07:17,110
So they had decided to
move it to another place.

4765
02:07:17,130 --> 02:07:17,530
I would have been.

4766
02:07:17,530 --> 02:07:19,470
Cause it's the biggest fight available.

4767
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:22,590
So just the biggest fight and
it would be in the biggest city.

4768
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:23,610
So it'd be like,

4769
02:07:23,610 --> 02:07:23,880
oh,

4770
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,390
I think as far as what I've read is that
they're still going to do a fight in

4771
02:07:27,391 --> 02:07:28,290
Brazil that week,

4772
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:28,951
but they're,

4773
02:07:28,951 --> 02:07:32,040
they're locking down where that's going
to be and who's going to be on that

4774
02:07:32,041 --> 02:07:32,331
card,

4775
02:07:32,331 --> 02:07:32,670
you know?

4776
02:07:32,670 --> 02:07:34,400
But the sheriffs are really great.

4777
02:07:34,401 --> 02:07:36,460
Anderson Silva and Max
is going to be in Vegas,

4778
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:40,930
which probably for Chell son
in his fucking way better,

4779
02:07:40,931 --> 02:07:41,490
man.

4780
02:07:41,490 --> 02:07:42,071
That guy was,

4781
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:43,930
he was in danger and danger.

4782
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:45,160
I don't know.

4783
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,900
That place was so goddamn beautiful.

4784
02:07:46,901 --> 02:07:47,710
Brazil.

4785
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:48,543
It's amazing.

4786
02:07:48,730 --> 02:07:51,090
What Ari and I were saying is we were
up at seven o'clock in the morning and

4787
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:52,780
watching these kids
playing and we're like,

4788
02:07:52,781 --> 02:07:54,250
look how great this life is.

4789
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:54,461
Like,

4790
02:07:54,461 --> 02:07:56,230
why don't kids in America do this?

4791
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:58,510
Why isn't everybody running
around and playing like this?

4792
02:07:58,511 --> 02:08:00,550
Like this is like they were so,

4793
02:08:00,670 --> 02:08:01,900
it looks so joyful.

4794
02:08:01,901 --> 02:08:02,950
There was so much fun too.

4795
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:06,190
And you knew that they probably were
pulling like America used to be,

4796
02:08:06,191 --> 02:08:09,850
or at least is it still looking in the
Midwest and stuff or just small towns

4797
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:11,560
where you just get up
and go play with people?

4798
02:08:11,590 --> 02:08:13,240
I don't know what I mean,

4799
02:08:13,241 --> 02:08:14,980
what makes a place like Brazil?

4800
02:08:14,981 --> 02:08:16,390
Is it just the environment,

4801
02:08:16,391 --> 02:08:16,931
the environment,

4802
02:08:16,931 --> 02:08:17,561
so beautiful.

4803
02:08:17,561 --> 02:08:19,930
The weather's so beautiful
there on the ocean.

4804
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:21,640
Ocean peep dwelling.

4805
02:08:21,641 --> 02:08:26,530
People almost always have like a certain
appreciation and respect for the ocean.

4806
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:27,890
Almost like a pre,

4807
02:08:27,891 --> 02:08:28,301
a little,

4808
02:08:28,301 --> 02:08:29,950
a little appreciation for nature.

4809
02:08:30,020 --> 02:08:32,200
That's why beach towns are always so calm.

4810
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:32,801
You know?

4811
02:08:32,801 --> 02:08:34,120
There's like almost like a chilled,

4812
02:08:34,121 --> 02:08:34,901
relaxed thing.

4813
02:08:34,901 --> 02:08:35,171
It's like,

4814
02:08:35,171 --> 02:08:35,710
man,

4815
02:08:35,710 --> 02:08:38,650
you're just faced with
something so impossible.

4816
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:42,280
You're looking out at fucking a hundred
trillion gallons of water or whatever

4817
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:44,620
the fuck the ocean is
where it's never ending.

4818
02:08:44,621 --> 02:08:45,970
You don't see the end of the water.

4819
02:08:45,971 --> 02:08:50,670
It goes bigger than the entire continent
that you're living on and just it's,

4820
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:51,820
it's so humbling.

4821
02:08:51,850 --> 02:08:53,280
It's just one of those
things that you look at it.

4822
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:53,800
It just,

4823
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,900
it makes you chill out a lot of a people,

4824
02:08:55,901 --> 02:08:58,640
but you have to have a higher power
that would make you have a higher power.

4825
02:08:58,641 --> 02:08:59,800
But some people don't want to say God,

4826
02:08:59,830 --> 02:09:00,481
so they can tell you.

4827
02:09:00,481 --> 02:09:01,360
It's like the ocean,

4828
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:01,841
just me.

4829
02:09:01,841 --> 02:09:02,800
More powerful than you are.

4830
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:03,161
Ooh,

4831
02:09:03,161 --> 02:09:03,870
I like that.

4832
02:09:03,870 --> 02:09:04,091
You know,

4833
02:09:04,091 --> 02:09:05,950
it sounds like led Zeppelin song too.

4834
02:09:06,250 --> 02:09:06,581
Damp,

4835
02:09:06,581 --> 02:09:07,300
damp towel.

4836
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:08,133
Now

4837
02:09:09,930 --> 02:09:11,950
digital is still number one.

4838
02:09:11,951 --> 02:09:16,670
And then we want to get Doug
Benson dethrone him for a
little bit and then back

4839
02:09:16,710 --> 02:09:17,520
just back and forth.

4840
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:17,620
Well,

4841
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:19,450
Doug Benson is not a comedy album.

4842
02:09:19,450 --> 02:09:20,470
It's just a podcast.

4843
02:09:20,471 --> 02:09:20,680
You know,

4844
02:09:20,680 --> 02:09:22,330
he puts his podcasts up for sale.

4845
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:22,810
Oh,

4846
02:09:22,810 --> 02:09:23,320
nice.

4847
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:23,501
Yeah.

4848
02:09:23,501 --> 02:09:24,400
A lot of guys do that.

4849
02:09:24,430 --> 02:09:26,110
There's a lot of controversy about that.

4850
02:09:26,380 --> 02:09:29,170
Some guys have like one a month
that they'll have for sale.

4851
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:30,310
It's a big giant thing.

4852
02:09:30,311 --> 02:09:31,144
It's like whatever.

4853
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,213
Yeah.

4854
02:09:32,250 --> 02:09:33,083
Um,

4855
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:34,091
wow.

4856
02:09:34,091 --> 02:09:34,810
So He's back there.

4857
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:38,350
Georgia is on my podcast this
week on the skeptic tank.

4858
02:09:38,410 --> 02:09:38,830
Yeah.

4859
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:39,590
Hey Joe,

4860
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:40,750
you having fun with it?

4861
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:42,500
I like it.

4862
02:09:42,570 --> 02:09:43,403
Do you want one a week?

4863
02:09:43,540 --> 02:09:44,373
Yeah.

4864
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:47,000
Sometimes I'll get a couple in a week or
two or three in a week if I'm gonna be

4865
02:09:47,001 --> 02:09:51,130
out of town a lot you want me
to do or anything like that.

4866
02:09:51,131 --> 02:09:51,964
Consistently.

4867
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:52,923
Really amazed.

4868
02:09:52,990 --> 02:09:53,823
How about us?

4869
02:09:54,180 --> 02:09:55,013
The fuck man.

4870
02:09:55,360 --> 02:09:56,480
I'm amazed we're doing it too.

4871
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:58,780
What does episodes us to
11 or something like that.

4872
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:00,110
It's crazy.

4873
02:10:00,110 --> 02:10:00,850
It's so you can,

4874
02:10:00,850 --> 02:10:01,421
at any point,

4875
02:10:01,421 --> 02:10:02,254
you could just be like,

4876
02:10:02,770 --> 02:10:04,570
I'm not going to do it anymore
and it'll just be done.

4877
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:05,403
There'll be no trouble.

4878
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:05,921
Yeah.

4879
02:10:05,921 --> 02:10:07,420
It would be a problem with getting fired.

4880
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:09,490
I think at this point in
time we have a commitment.

4881
02:10:09,491 --> 02:10:10,324
Yeah.

4882
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:10,931
Yeah.

4883
02:10:10,931 --> 02:10:13,360
I don't think we would
be able to stop and go.

4884
02:10:13,380 --> 02:10:13,990
It's impossible.

4885
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:16,900
There's too many people because I
like nothing's really pushing you on.

4886
02:10:16,930 --> 02:10:17,860
There's nothing real there.

4887
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:18,250
Yeah.

4888
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:19,570
We all desire to keep doing it.

4889
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:20,530
We owe people,

4890
02:10:20,650 --> 02:10:21,340
they've listened.

4891
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:25,180
They've weighed our life better because
they liked this podcast and I think we

4892
02:10:25,181 --> 02:10:25,750
owe them that.

4893
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:27,790
People go to so many more comedy shows.

4894
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:28,870
We're not going to stop.

4895
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:30,070
Did I think it's in general?

4896
02:10:30,071 --> 02:10:30,910
Not just with this podcast,

4897
02:10:30,911 --> 02:10:31,541
but in general.

4898
02:10:31,541 --> 02:10:33,800
It started this renaissance
of standup comedy.

4899
02:10:33,850 --> 02:10:34,370
Yes.

4900
02:10:34,370 --> 02:10:36,170
I go around the country and it's like,

4901
02:10:36,171 --> 02:10:37,490
and I see the clubs,

4902
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,840
the like hometown club.

4903
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:40,010
It's just more people that are out.

4904
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:40,520
Yeah.

4905
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:44,540
People have access to this art form they'd
never had before and there's no more

4906
02:10:44,541 --> 02:10:45,060
good guy.

4907
02:10:45,060 --> 02:10:45,893
Yeah.

4908
02:10:46,450 --> 02:10:49,580
You can just find who your
aesthetically pleasing person is.

4909
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:50,170
Yeah.

4910
02:10:50,170 --> 02:10:50,400
You know,

4911
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:54,020
Max dices kid went up at the
ice house the other night,

4912
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:58,300
did create on the podcast and went up
and killed at the comedy show him like I

4913
02:10:58,310 --> 02:10:59,030
just,

4914
02:10:59,030 --> 02:11:00,140
I can't see enough of that.

4915
02:11:00,141 --> 02:11:02,620
I can't see enough of like
this new generation coming in.

4916
02:11:02,820 --> 02:11:03,291
They're good.

4917
02:11:03,291 --> 02:11:04,280
I can't see enough of that.

4918
02:11:04,400 --> 02:11:04,940
Yeah.

4919
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:05,840
It's so inspiring.

4920
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:09,980
It's beautiful and podcasts are allowing
these kids to sort of get their stage.

4921
02:11:10,190 --> 02:11:10,611
I'm telling you,

4922
02:11:10,611 --> 02:11:10,880
man,

4923
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:13,130
that's one of the reasons why
the Atlanta show went so well.

4924
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:15,110
I'm so used to talking in front of people.

4925
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:16,160
That's got to be a lot of it too.

4926
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:19,560
I wrote down the podcasting is
like cross training for stand up.

4927
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,560
It is like not full job.

4928
02:11:21,580 --> 02:11:22,101
It's just training,

4929
02:11:22,101 --> 02:11:22,820
thinking and stuff.

4930
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:24,660
It's like it gets you
in shape for stand up.

4931
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:25,130
Yeah.

4932
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:26,570
I could never have gone up on that.

4933
02:11:26,571 --> 02:11:27,290
Just doing that.

4934
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:28,500
Whatever quick set.

4935
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:32,090
If it wasn't for a guys I would have
fucked said fuck you and like shit myself.

4936
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:34,010
You Know Eddie Bravo is going
to do some dates with us.

4937
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:35,450
He's going to emcee some shows.

4938
02:11:35,870 --> 02:11:36,300
Nice.

4939
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:37,071
Any problem at once?

4940
02:11:37,071 --> 02:11:38,000
You want to go on stage?

4941
02:11:38,030 --> 02:11:38,751
He wants to MC,

4942
02:11:38,751 --> 02:11:39,710
he wants to bring people up.

4943
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:41,390
It's got a lot starter.

4944
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:41,871
He goes,

4945
02:11:41,871 --> 02:11:42,071
I,

4946
02:11:42,071 --> 02:11:42,411
I might,

4947
02:11:42,411 --> 02:11:43,820
I might try to do a joke
or two here and there.

4948
02:11:43,821 --> 02:11:44,061
I'm like,

4949
02:11:44,061 --> 02:11:44,894
you can do it.

4950
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:46,070
Like of course you can do it.

4951
02:11:46,071 --> 02:11:46,390
Anyone,

4952
02:11:46,390 --> 02:11:47,120
but if he doesn't want it,

4953
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:47,953
they're just like,

4954
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:48,740
he's what?

4955
02:11:48,740 --> 02:11:49,880
He wants to encourage them,

4956
02:11:49,881 --> 02:11:51,020
encourage them on Twitter for me.

4957
02:11:51,021 --> 02:11:51,370
Awesome.

4958
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:52,110
Cause he can do it.

4959
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:54,270
Eddie Bravo is one of the
funniest dudes I've ever met.

4960
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,130
I have to bring them up.

4961
02:11:55,130 --> 02:11:58,190
It's all about for him it
would just be about focusing.

4962
02:11:58,220 --> 02:12:00,380
It would just be about him finding,

4963
02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:01,061
you know what?

4964
02:12:01,061 --> 02:12:03,200
Whatever it is that he
thinks is funny and focusing.

4965
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:03,830
See,

4966
02:12:03,830 --> 02:12:05,050
I know you're just scratching your beard,

4967
02:12:05,051 --> 02:12:07,680
but it looks like you're totally
shaking your head when you're doing,

4968
02:12:09,930 --> 02:12:11,840
but I just want to straighten
that out with all the internet.

4969
02:12:11,841 --> 02:12:13,970
Detective Brian has got it on his face,

4970
02:12:13,971 --> 02:12:16,280
but you don't see that because
the microphone balls in the face,

4971
02:12:16,430 --> 02:12:18,440
so it totally looked like
you were shaking your head.

4972
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,420
It's just crazy.

4973
02:12:20,421 --> 02:12:21,140
Itchy eye.

4974
02:12:21,140 --> 02:12:22,460
That was definitely an itch.

4975
02:12:22,461 --> 02:12:23,294
Sorry,

4976
02:12:24,380 --> 02:12:25,970
I just started going
back to Jujitsu again.

4977
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:27,050
I took three months off.

4978
02:12:27,110 --> 02:12:28,490
I don't want your bulk up to get fat.

4979
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:28,821
No,

4980
02:12:28,821 --> 02:12:29,150
I heard,

4981
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:29,301
no,

4982
02:12:29,301 --> 02:12:29,581
I didn't,

4983
02:12:29,581 --> 02:12:30,230
didn't do anything.

4984
02:12:30,230 --> 02:12:31,063
I stayed the same way.

4985
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:32,083
I kept training.

4986
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:33,650
I made sure I kept working out.

4987
02:12:34,070 --> 02:12:34,903
I stayed in shape.

4988
02:12:35,180 --> 02:12:35,841
I stayed in,

4989
02:12:35,841 --> 02:12:36,190
um,

4990
02:12:36,190 --> 02:12:39,460
like kettle bell shape and weight
lifting shape and workout shape.

4991
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:40,850
But that's less than just the shape.

4992
02:12:40,940 --> 02:12:42,160
It's not good as Jujitsu's shape.

4993
02:12:42,440 --> 02:12:43,460
[inaudible] harder.

4994
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:44,540
Wow.

4995
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:47,870
I found myself struggling for
the first couple of classes,

4996
02:12:47,871 --> 02:12:51,020
but not nearly as much as I'd
be if I didn't do anything.

4997
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:51,831
If I didn't do anything,

4998
02:12:51,831 --> 02:12:52,700
I wouldn't be able to do it.

4999
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:55,640
We're literally wouldn't cause one of
the things that I thought about while I

5000
02:12:55,641 --> 02:12:57,950
was working out why
take took the time off.

5001
02:12:58,140 --> 02:12:59,210
That was when I was training.

5002
02:12:59,240 --> 02:12:59,691
I was working,

5003
02:12:59,691 --> 02:13:01,510
I was training to go back and roll.

5004
02:13:01,590 --> 02:13:03,500
Like I knew I did not want to get tired.

5005
02:13:03,501 --> 02:13:03,800
Yeah.

5006
02:13:03,800 --> 02:13:04,820
I did not want to get tired.

5007
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:06,380
I was doing a lot of sprints.

5008
02:13:06,710 --> 02:13:07,670
It was doing a lot of,

5009
02:13:07,671 --> 02:13:08,150
um,

5010
02:13:08,150 --> 02:13:09,440
especially on the elliptical.

5011
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:09,831
I do.

5012
02:13:09,831 --> 02:13:12,650
These things were just
purely for cardio purposes.

5013
02:13:12,651 --> 02:13:17,651
I would do maybe 10 to 15 minutes
as a warmup at a reasonable pace.

5014
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:21,410
And then I would set it fairly stiff,

5015
02:13:21,411 --> 02:13:23,540
like level 13 or 14 maybe 15 minutes.

5016
02:13:23,690 --> 02:13:26,930
And then I would know I would
blitzkrieg for 30 seconds,

5017
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:31,960
just as hard as I can do it for 30 seconds
and then kick it back and recover for

5018
02:13:32,221 --> 02:13:33,720
30 seconds and then do it again.

5019
02:13:33,870 --> 02:13:35,280
And I did it for 20 minutes.

5020
02:13:35,281 --> 02:13:37,920
So essentially 10 20 sprints,

5021
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:40,970
20 mad crazy sprints
when I lost all that way.

5022
02:13:40,971 --> 02:13:41,850
That's what I used to do.

5023
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:43,051
The elliptical.

5024
02:13:43,051 --> 02:13:46,980
I would go as hard as I could for a
minute and then do three minutes of just,

5025
02:13:47,340 --> 02:13:50,910
just kind of sitting there with my heart
rate really high up and then it's so

5026
02:13:50,911 --> 02:13:51,511
hard,

5027
02:13:51,511 --> 02:13:51,811
man.

5028
02:13:51,811 --> 02:13:53,040
It's such a great workout.

5029
02:13:53,041 --> 02:13:55,830
I mean like when someone tells you you
can't get a good workout on an elliptical

5030
02:13:55,831 --> 02:13:56,221
machine,

5031
02:13:56,221 --> 02:13:56,371
like,

5032
02:13:56,371 --> 02:13:56,611
bitch,

5033
02:13:56,611 --> 02:13:57,421
you're crazy.

5034
02:13:57,421 --> 02:13:58,890
I go when I'm in hotel rooms,

5035
02:13:59,070 --> 02:14:00,690
if I'm staying in a hotel and they say,

5036
02:14:00,691 --> 02:14:00,931
oh,

5037
02:14:00,931 --> 02:14:02,130
all they have is an elliptical machine,

5038
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:06,360
I can get a fucking ferocious cardio
workout in on an elliptical machine.

5039
02:14:06,370 --> 02:14:06,660
Yeah,

5040
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:08,040
you just got to use it the right way.

5041
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:10,530
And the beautiful thing is you
don't get injured on those.

5042
02:14:10,531 --> 02:14:10,801
You don't,

5043
02:14:10,801 --> 02:14:12,560
you're not going to
hurt your knees or yeah,

5044
02:14:13,050 --> 02:14:14,010
no impact.

5045
02:14:14,011 --> 02:14:15,520
It's all circular motions.

5046
02:14:17,190 --> 02:14:18,023
You did too.

5047
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:19,020
So did Eddie Bravo,

5048
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:23,190
some sort of a meniscus
thing have happened to you?

5049
02:14:23,360 --> 02:14:26,160
I think he's a cartilage cartilage.

5050
02:14:26,700 --> 02:14:27,470
My other name,

5051
02:14:27,470 --> 02:14:29,550
the other name you play
in basketball still?

5052
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:30,571
No,

5053
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:30,751
no,

5054
02:14:30,751 --> 02:14:30,941
no.

5055
02:14:30,941 --> 02:14:31,740
I'm not.

5056
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:33,390
I can't do those bodywork.

5057
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:35,090
Bodyweight squats that I,

5058
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:36,000
I know I showed those.

5059
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:41,280
Those are like literally miracle workers
for strengthening and tightening your

5060
02:14:41,281 --> 02:14:42,114
knees.

5061
02:14:42,270 --> 02:14:47,270
One of the best exercises I've ever had
for a leg endurance and for a building

5062
02:14:48,541 --> 02:14:51,180
up the muscles in the
years I just standing up,

5063
02:14:51,181 --> 02:14:52,530
I took my shoes off after basketball.

5064
02:14:52,540 --> 02:14:54,720
I stood up and I just felt the pop fluid.

5065
02:14:55,140 --> 02:14:55,590
Well,

5066
02:14:55,590 --> 02:14:56,423
can they fix it?

5067
02:14:56,430 --> 02:14:58,890
When they say he's got to
say exactly what it is first,

5068
02:14:58,950 --> 02:15:00,600
that's like a doctor to
the other one that really,

5069
02:15:00,601 --> 02:15:01,434
he's really,

5070
02:15:01,520 --> 02:15:02,353
uh,

5071
02:15:02,520 --> 02:15:02,731
no,

5072
02:15:02,731 --> 02:15:03,570
that's the pot doctor.

5073
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:03,901
Oh,

5074
02:15:03,901 --> 02:15:04,710
whoops.

5075
02:15:04,710 --> 02:15:05,250
Oh,

5076
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:06,083
get a little bit.

5077
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:10,780
I know my doctors or my doctor.

5078
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:12,493
Yeah,

5079
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:13,530
he's a real doctor.

5080
02:15:14,150 --> 02:15:15,810
He worked on my knee two times.

5081
02:15:15,811 --> 02:15:19,020
He fixed my right knee and he
fixed the meniscus in my left knee.

5082
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:22,980
He fixed my left knee when everybody else
had fucked it up or the other guy had

5083
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:23,520
fucked it up.

5084
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,240
The other guy,

5085
02:15:24,240 --> 02:15:28,410
he did want to scope it and he tried to
stitch it up and it just never really

5086
02:15:28,411 --> 02:15:28,771
healed.

5087
02:15:28,771 --> 02:15:30,580
It was always amazing how
when you think about it,

5088
02:15:30,581 --> 02:15:30,931
you'd think like,

5089
02:15:30,931 --> 02:15:31,770
doctors know what they're doing,

5090
02:15:31,771 --> 02:15:33,390
but like some doctors are bad.

5091
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:35,220
You need doctors that work with athletes.

5092
02:15:35,250 --> 02:15:38,310
That's what you need because one of the
things that happened after I got an MRI

5093
02:15:38,311 --> 02:15:39,360
when I tore my meniscus,

5094
02:15:39,361 --> 02:15:40,980
which is a really simple thing,

5095
02:15:41,220 --> 02:15:44,270
the meniscus is not that big
of a deal out of the scope,

5096
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:44,910
the rest over.

5097
02:15:44,910 --> 02:15:48,360
But the doctor is sitting there telling
me I need to stop doing martial arts.

5098
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:48,691
By the way,

5099
02:15:48,691 --> 02:15:49,171
this is the only,

5100
02:15:49,171 --> 02:15:50,550
I was only 30 at the time,

5101
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:51,210
you know,

5102
02:15:51,210 --> 02:15:53,370
and the doctor's telling me you need
to stop doing martial arts and I'm

5103
02:15:53,371 --> 02:15:55,890
listening to her and I'm going,

5104
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:56,581
first of all,

5105
02:15:56,581 --> 02:15:57,031
why am I,

5106
02:15:57,031 --> 02:15:58,890
why are you telling me I'm
not asking you for this,

5107
02:15:58,920 --> 02:15:59,221
let me go,

5108
02:15:59,221 --> 02:16:01,710
I don't see where this is
like that big of an issue.

5109
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:02,461
And she's like,

5110
02:16:02,461 --> 02:16:05,610
you're going to continue to injure this
knee or you're telling me that it's

5111
02:16:05,611 --> 02:16:09,540
impossible to rehabilitate a meniscus
tear and get my body to a condition where

5112
02:16:09,541 --> 02:16:10,374
I can train again.

5113
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:11,670
I call shenanigans.

5114
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:12,793
Okay.

5115
02:16:12,930 --> 02:16:13,820
Just because you,

5116
02:16:13,821 --> 02:16:14,041
you know,

5117
02:16:14,041 --> 02:16:15,540
you say you'd rather not have that,

5118
02:16:15,541 --> 02:16:16,680
but like what bitch,

5119
02:16:16,681 --> 02:16:17,550
what are you talking about?

5120
02:16:17,780 --> 02:16:20,100
I've been stitched up together
like 15 fucking times.

5121
02:16:20,101 --> 02:16:20,890
I know what I'm doing.

5122
02:16:20,890 --> 02:16:22,050
I'm going to get stolen to deal with.

5123
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:22,883
It was like,

5124
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:24,780
oh no it was with some of weird,

5125
02:16:24,781 --> 02:16:25,890
she was being my mom.

5126
02:16:25,891 --> 02:16:26,310
Do you think,

5127
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:28,860
do you think it's going to catch
up like say 30 years from now?

5128
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:29,620
No,

5129
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:29,861
no.

5130
02:16:29,861 --> 02:16:30,340
I have no,

5131
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:31,490
no pain man suit.

5132
02:16:31,491 --> 02:16:34,600
First of all I make sure
I stretch out like crazy.

5133
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:34,931
Okay.

5134
02:16:34,931 --> 02:16:35,501
Second of all,

5135
02:16:35,501 --> 02:16:37,060
I eat a lot of fish oil.

5136
02:16:37,300 --> 02:16:39,550
I take like 10,000
milligrams official a day.

5137
02:16:39,551 --> 02:16:44,150
I think that alone promotes like healthy
strong joints and second of all I

5138
02:16:44,530 --> 02:16:47,380
stretching and doing all
these body weight exercises.

5139
02:16:47,590 --> 02:16:52,590
Really important for strengthening up the
joints and tightening those bodyweight

5140
02:16:52,690 --> 02:16:53,141
squats.

5141
02:16:53,141 --> 02:16:56,890
You go all the way down your ass touches
your heel and your heel comes off the

5142
02:16:56,891 --> 02:17:00,670
ground and you push up from there and
when you do like hundreds of those right

5143
02:17:00,671 --> 02:17:02,710
at the knee is where you
build all your muscle.

5144
02:17:02,711 --> 02:17:03,790
Like all up in here,

5145
02:17:03,791 --> 02:17:07,330
like the flip cap of the quads
and all around your knee.

5146
02:17:07,330 --> 02:17:10,660
All that builds up cause it's
like a really high volume.

5147
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:11,111
You know,

5148
02:17:11,111 --> 02:17:15,340
you're doing like 200 of
them and it really tightens
and strengthens everything.

5149
02:17:15,341 --> 02:17:16,450
It gives you more endurance in it.

5150
02:17:16,451 --> 02:17:19,960
Also because of the fact that your legs
have done so much more work and they're

5151
02:17:19,961 --> 02:17:20,740
stronger,

5152
02:17:20,740 --> 02:17:23,140
you're less likely to
have them buckle on you.

5153
02:17:23,141 --> 02:17:26,810
They're less likely to give out all
car literally though muscle control.

5154
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:27,450
Exactly.

5155
02:17:27,450 --> 02:17:30,640
That's a lot of the reasons why people
get injured is because they don't have

5156
02:17:30,641 --> 02:17:34,240
enough physical strength to stop
the injury from taking place.

5157
02:17:34,241 --> 02:17:34,691
Their body,

5158
02:17:34,691 --> 02:17:34,930
you know,

5159
02:17:34,930 --> 02:17:35,380
they're,

5160
02:17:35,380 --> 02:17:38,380
they're the coordination
or they're exhausted or old
people fall and break their

5161
02:17:38,381 --> 02:17:39,160
muscles cause there's nothing.

5162
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:39,993
No fucking

5163
02:17:41,350 --> 02:17:41,591
broke.

5164
02:17:41,591 --> 02:17:42,640
The bones cause no muscles.

5165
02:17:42,641 --> 02:17:43,930
The guard gives that too.

5166
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:45,730
Well also their bones get really fragile.

5167
02:17:45,731 --> 02:17:47,620
That's one of the things
that osteoporosis,

5168
02:17:47,621 --> 02:17:48,160
they,

5169
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:48,551
they uh,

5170
02:17:48,551 --> 02:17:50,600
if you're not lifting
weights are taking care of,

5171
02:17:50,601 --> 02:17:50,830
uh,

5172
02:17:50,830 --> 02:17:51,021
your,

5173
02:17:51,021 --> 02:17:52,480
your body in that way where you're adding,

5174
02:17:52,510 --> 02:17:52,751
you know,

5175
02:17:52,751 --> 02:17:53,830
it's really important,

5176
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:56,680
especially as you get older to
actually physically lift weights.

5177
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:58,510
If you want to keep
your bone density bone,

5178
02:17:58,960 --> 02:17:59,890
your bone density.

5179
02:17:59,990 --> 02:18:00,370
Yeah,

5180
02:18:00,370 --> 02:18:01,340
it's very important there.

5181
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:05,080
There's old dudes like you can go to
the gym and there was a guy named Albert

5182
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:09,430
Beckels and I believe he was in
his late fifties or sixties Bryant,

5183
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:10,750
Google that guy for me,

5184
02:18:10,751 --> 02:18:11,021
please.

5185
02:18:11,021 --> 02:18:15,550
Albert Beckels and Albert
Beckels bodybuilder.

5186
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:18,760
And he was really old man.

5187
02:18:18,761 --> 02:18:19,990
And I went to the gym.

5188
02:18:19,991 --> 02:18:23,620
There was a gold's gym in north Hollywood
when I lived in north Hollywood.

5189
02:18:23,621 --> 02:18:25,210
And I used to see him training.

5190
02:18:25,211 --> 02:18:25,660
They're like,

5191
02:18:25,660 --> 02:18:26,320
Charles Atlas,

5192
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:26,820
just be a man.

5193
02:18:26,820 --> 02:18:28,480
He was all as fuck dude.

5194
02:18:28,481 --> 02:18:29,500
And he was so,

5195
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:29,981
Whoa,

5196
02:18:29,981 --> 02:18:31,450
like a motherfucker.

5197
02:18:31,570 --> 02:18:32,860
Look out the photos of that guy.

5198
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:33,041
I mean,

5199
02:18:33,041 --> 02:18:34,420
he's kind of really nice asshole.

5200
02:18:35,290 --> 02:18:36,010
Um,

5201
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:36,370
uh,

5202
02:18:36,370 --> 02:18:37,300
what was the other guy's name?

5203
02:18:37,301 --> 02:18:37,430
But,

5204
02:18:37,430 --> 02:18:38,100
oh,

5205
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:39,490
look at this photo of this guy.

5206
02:18:39,550 --> 02:18:41,020
See if you can get a nice big one.

5207
02:18:41,350 --> 02:18:42,100
That's him.

5208
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:42,933
He's black.

5209
02:18:43,350 --> 02:18:43,550
Like,

5210
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:43,750
uh,

5211
02:18:43,750 --> 02:18:44,800
yeah dude.

5212
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:46,660
I mean right there.

5213
02:18:46,661 --> 02:18:48,700
And he's probably like fucking
60 years old or something.

5214
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:50,590
And I'm not kidding.

5215
02:18:51,430 --> 02:18:53,770
The guy was fucking enormous.

5216
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:56,980
Just don't that a picture of his bicep.

5217
02:18:57,010 --> 02:18:57,843
That's his bicep.

5218
02:18:58,440 --> 02:18:59,260
Just pick,

5219
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:00,310
just click on one picture.

5220
02:19:00,311 --> 02:19:01,390
So Ra can get us,

5221
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:02,350
there's a good picture of him.

5222
02:19:02,351 --> 02:19:04,750
He's bald and old shit,

5223
02:19:04,751 --> 02:19:05,584
and just

5224
02:19:06,890 --> 02:19:09,610
look at the body on that guy's ridiculous.

5225
02:19:09,750 --> 02:19:11,320
Fuck there's this would be,

5226
02:19:11,321 --> 02:19:12,910
that's the only way you can do that.

5227
02:19:12,940 --> 02:19:13,773
We'll start Roy.

5228
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,810
But the other way is you,

5229
02:19:15,811 --> 02:19:20,260
you have to lift weights in order
to keep that density up at that age.

5230
02:19:20,290 --> 02:19:21,250
That keeps your bones,

5231
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,780
your muscles,

5232
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:23,613
your bones,

5233
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:24,820
weightlifting,

5234
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:29,570
especially like real heavy weight
exercises like dead lifts and squats.

5235
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:32,090
They contribute to thicker bone density.

5236
02:19:32,240 --> 02:19:32,600
Wow.

5237
02:19:32,600 --> 02:19:32,931
Yeah.

5238
02:19:32,931 --> 02:19:34,370
It's really important as you get older,

5239
02:19:34,371 --> 02:19:37,550
especially because that's when your
bones start to get brittle and fragile.

5240
02:19:37,550 --> 02:19:39,260
So guys like Albert Beckels.

5241
02:19:39,261 --> 02:19:40,100
I bet that guy's like,

5242
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:41,490
look at that guy's body and that's an,

5243
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:42,590
he's in his fifties there,

5244
02:19:42,591 --> 02:19:43,280
dude.

5245
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:43,731
I mean,

5246
02:19:43,731 --> 02:19:45,110
he was just the animal.

5247
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:45,501
There's,

5248
02:19:45,501 --> 02:19:46,910
there's certainly dudes like that.

5249
02:19:46,940 --> 02:19:47,773
Yeah.

5250
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:48,613
By the way,

5251
02:19:48,670 --> 02:19:49,503
orange but,

5252
02:19:49,570 --> 02:19:54,550
but also intense workouts and
intense training and focus you,

5253
02:19:54,551 --> 02:19:57,710
you can't just give it all the steroids
there because the guy still had to do

5254
02:19:57,711 --> 02:19:58,131
the work.

5255
02:19:58,131 --> 02:19:59,090
The steroids if he took,

5256
02:19:59,091 --> 02:19:59,301
yeah,

5257
02:19:59,301 --> 02:20:00,830
if he just took steroids only,

5258
02:20:00,831 --> 02:20:01,970
he would still never get that big.

5259
02:20:01,971 --> 02:20:02,804
Those guys have,

5260
02:20:03,650 --> 02:20:05,090
I'll never be that lean,

5261
02:20:05,091 --> 02:20:05,351
you know?

5262
02:20:05,351 --> 02:20:07,900
I mean you have to be incredibly
dedicated to get down to that level.

5263
02:20:07,920 --> 02:20:10,370
And he's like championship
bodybuilder level.

5264
02:20:10,580 --> 02:20:14,060
But the difference between a guy like
them or a guy like say Steve Maxwell,

5265
02:20:14,061 --> 02:20:18,980
Steve Maxwell is a guy who was 100%
natural and he's a fitness fanatic and he

5266
02:20:18,981 --> 02:20:19,161
is,

5267
02:20:19,161 --> 02:20:20,600
I believe he's about 60.

5268
02:20:20,610 --> 02:20:21,450
I talked to Steve.

5269
02:20:22,100 --> 02:20:22,370
No,

5270
02:20:22,370 --> 02:20:22,771
no that's,

5271
02:20:22,771 --> 02:20:23,750
that's Steve Graham.

5272
02:20:24,020 --> 02:20:27,410
Steve Maxwell is the guy who teaches
me kettle bells and comes over like a

5273
02:20:27,411 --> 02:20:28,970
couple of times a year and we,

5274
02:20:28,971 --> 02:20:29,530
you know,

5275
02:20:29,530 --> 02:20:31,040
he will go out size,

5276
02:20:31,041 --> 02:20:31,670
body issues.

5277
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:34,670
He comes and trains me for like three
days and shows me all sorts of new shit

5278
02:20:34,671 --> 02:20:35,720
and I film it on my uh,

5279
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:36,613
my iPhone.

5280
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:38,000
He's a master dude.

5281
02:20:38,001 --> 02:20:39,380
He's Steve Maxwell.

5282
02:20:39,381 --> 02:20:40,340
You can follow him on Twitter.

5283
02:20:40,341 --> 02:20:40,821
I don't know.

5284
02:20:40,821 --> 02:20:42,950
I think its maximal
strength and conditioning.

5285
02:20:42,951 --> 02:20:43,401
Maxwell,

5286
02:20:43,401 --> 02:20:44,234
SNC,

5287
02:20:44,800 --> 02:20:45,561
Matt Maxwell,

5288
02:20:45,561 --> 02:20:46,394
SC maybe.

5289
02:20:46,400 --> 02:20:46,880
Um,

5290
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:47,890
but he's a,

5291
02:20:47,891 --> 02:20:52,891
a real master when it comes to training
and different things that you can do to,

5292
02:20:53,481 --> 02:20:53,870
uh,

5293
02:20:53,870 --> 02:20:55,790
to keep your body
healthy as you get young.

5294
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:57,380
Like he has a whole series,

5295
02:20:57,381 --> 02:21:02,300
a DVD series all on joint mobility and
how important it is to stretch as you get

5296
02:21:02,301 --> 02:21:02,870
older.

5297
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:03,890
Your range of motion,

5298
02:21:03,891 --> 02:21:04,790
especially if you're not,

5299
02:21:04,791 --> 02:21:06,260
like if you're just sitting in an office,

5300
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:09,350
your range of motion is going to get
more and more limited because you're not

5301
02:21:09,351 --> 02:21:10,010
doing shit.

5302
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:11,420
Your body's not going anywhere.

5303
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:12,254
You're just sitting there.

5304
02:21:12,370 --> 02:21:13,320
I was able to use those,

5305
02:21:13,580 --> 02:21:15,290
those yoga guys that
can stretch like crazy.

5306
02:21:15,291 --> 02:21:16,790
They always like shocked me.

5307
02:21:16,850 --> 02:21:17,180
Yeah,

5308
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:17,760
it's incredible.

5309
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:18,593
And it's,

5310
02:21:18,710 --> 02:21:20,240
it's because they keep doing it.

5311
02:21:20,420 --> 02:21:21,081
It's because,

5312
02:21:21,081 --> 02:21:21,381
you know,

5313
02:21:21,381 --> 02:21:25,880
I mean most of the reasons why I'm still
flexible at this age is because when I

5314
02:21:25,881 --> 02:21:27,860
was 15 to the time I was 44,

5315
02:21:27,861 --> 02:21:28,850
I never stopped stretching.

5316
02:21:29,150 --> 02:21:30,140
You just keep doing it.

5317
02:21:30,141 --> 02:21:31,250
If you keep doing it,

5318
02:21:31,251 --> 02:21:32,084
you can keep it up.

5319
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:32,840
But if,

5320
02:21:32,840 --> 02:21:34,700
if you take off just like a few months,

5321
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:37,580
you'd take off just a few months of
training and don't work out and don't do

5322
02:21:37,581 --> 02:21:38,271
shit for a few months,

5323
02:21:38,271 --> 02:21:41,030
your body will turn to a
sack of shit like that.

5324
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:42,461
Do you feel that when you've,

5325
02:21:42,461 --> 02:21:42,840
when he stopped,

5326
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:44,180
but he just kept trying
and kept working out.

5327
02:21:44,181 --> 02:21:44,421
Dude,

5328
02:21:44,421 --> 02:21:45,254
I've never stopped.

5329
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:47,130
Even when I get injured I'll,

5330
02:21:47,270 --> 02:21:48,860
I'll stop doing certain things.

5331
02:21:48,860 --> 02:21:51,710
Like I've been places where they
say you can't do any working out.

5332
02:21:51,711 --> 02:21:52,850
Like after I got my nose fixed,

5333
02:21:53,090 --> 02:21:54,890
I couldn't do anything for a full month.

5334
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:55,690
They said,

5335
02:21:55,690 --> 02:21:55,910
yeah,

5336
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:56,460
they don't want to,

5337
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:59,380
you're elevating your temperature or your,

5338
02:21:59,390 --> 02:21:59,540
uh,

5339
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:00,530
blood pressure rather.

5340
02:22:00,531 --> 02:22:01,460
And possibly,

5341
02:22:01,461 --> 02:22:01,851
you know,

5342
02:22:01,851 --> 02:22:02,684
opening up,

5343
02:22:02,690 --> 02:22:03,830
some of the sutures are in,

5344
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:05,570
so no exercise at all for four weeks.

5345
02:22:05,900 --> 02:22:07,100
So for four weeks I was like,

5346
02:22:07,101 --> 02:22:07,690
fuck,

5347
02:22:07,690 --> 02:22:09,140
there's just eat pizza and commit to it.

5348
02:22:09,141 --> 02:22:09,560
No,

5349
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:09,881
I just,

5350
02:22:09,881 --> 02:22:10,910
I just try to eat healthy,

5351
02:22:11,210 --> 02:22:12,410
but I couldn't do shit.

5352
02:22:12,430 --> 02:22:12,590
And,

5353
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:13,760
and in hopes that a,

5354
02:22:13,761 --> 02:22:14,051
I want,

5355
02:22:14,051 --> 02:22:17,360
I didn't want this operation to be
fucked up cause I was without a nose to

5356
02:22:17,361 --> 02:22:18,710
breathe out of for most of my life.

5357
02:22:18,711 --> 02:22:19,790
And I knew how terrible it was.

5358
02:22:20,330 --> 02:22:21,470
But then once I did it,

5359
02:22:21,471 --> 02:22:21,801
I was like,

5360
02:22:21,801 --> 02:22:23,660
that was a race to get back in shape.

5361
02:22:23,810 --> 02:22:24,643
Terrified.

5362
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:25,531
Because as you get older,

5363
02:22:25,531 --> 02:22:25,920
man,

5364
02:22:25,920 --> 02:22:26,170
the,

5365
02:22:26,170 --> 02:22:26,390
the,

5366
02:22:26,390 --> 02:22:28,030
the morning show is lethal.

5367
02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:28,903
You just stay there.

5368
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:29,401
Yeah.

5369
02:22:29,401 --> 02:22:30,780
You can just become a lazy fuck.

5370
02:22:32,240 --> 02:22:32,850
What,

5371
02:22:32,850 --> 02:22:34,350
what you gotta do this?

5372
02:22:34,351 --> 02:22:35,700
Cut this festival next year.

5373
02:22:36,090 --> 02:22:36,750
Which festival?

5374
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:38,790
Moontower Moontower Austin one.

5375
02:22:39,240 --> 02:22:40,560
Did you just get back from that?

5376
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:40,890
Yeah.

5377
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:41,610
What was it?

5378
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:42,700
Everybody's going to festival mail.

5379
02:22:43,220 --> 02:22:44,970
Did they pay you or did they uh,

5380
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:45,240
yeah.

5381
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:45,810
Yeah.

5382
02:22:45,810 --> 02:22:46,441
We're going to have a desk.

5383
02:22:46,441 --> 02:22:47,274
Quite festival.

5384
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:47,910
We should,

5385
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:48,451
that's quite fast.

5386
02:22:48,451 --> 02:22:51,290
Is gonna have music like honey honey
asked them if they went to calm me.

5387
02:22:51,291 --> 02:22:52,160
We have some ever where,

5388
02:22:52,270 --> 02:22:53,103
where should we do this?

5389
02:22:53,190 --> 02:22:53,490
Uh,

5390
02:22:53,490 --> 02:22:55,050
I think fucking Joshua Tree.

5391
02:22:55,590 --> 02:22:55,861
Really?

5392
02:22:55,861 --> 02:22:57,000
But then he's going to go out there.

5393
02:22:57,001 --> 02:22:57,211
No,

5394
02:22:57,211 --> 02:22:57,451
no,

5395
02:22:57,451 --> 02:22:57,780
no.

5396
02:22:57,780 --> 02:22:58,450
In a city.

5397
02:22:58,450 --> 02:22:58,710
Yeah.

5398
02:22:58,710 --> 02:22:58,971
Why did,

5399
02:22:58,971 --> 02:22:59,820
why did they have to go somewhere?

5400
02:22:59,821 --> 02:23:00,654
Vegas.

5401
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:04,140
Vegas isn't a bad idea.

5402
02:23:05,490 --> 02:23:06,510
Vegas is not a bad idea.

5403
02:23:07,360 --> 02:23:08,790
The Vegas again costs money,

5404
02:23:08,791 --> 02:23:09,031
man.

5405
02:23:09,031 --> 02:23:10,320
You got flying in and shit.

5406
02:23:10,430 --> 02:23:11,590
Tax is just do it for locals.

5407
02:23:12,090 --> 02:23:12,541
Austin,

5408
02:23:12,541 --> 02:23:13,290
Texas,

5409
02:23:13,290 --> 02:23:13,591
Austin,

5410
02:23:13,591 --> 02:23:15,540
Texas might not be a bad idea
somewhere where it's warm.

5411
02:23:15,541 --> 02:23:18,120
That's all that's in Texas
is in the middle too,

5412
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:21,380
so a lot of people can fucking drive
there or fly there are a lot easier and

5413
02:23:21,410 --> 02:23:21,580
said,

5414
02:23:21,580 --> 02:23:22,500
well if we were going to have it,

5415
02:23:22,501 --> 02:23:25,890
we would want to have it at a place
where there would be enough hotel rooms.

5416
02:23:26,030 --> 02:23:27,270
It was how many people are going to come?

5417
02:23:27,271 --> 02:23:27,570
You see?

5418
02:23:27,570 --> 02:23:30,150
Let's say if we have like putting
New York do a comedy show,

5419
02:23:30,360 --> 02:23:31,193
they're

5420
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,080
so expensive.

5421
02:23:34,470 --> 02:23:35,880
Looked at southwest by southwest,

5422
02:23:35,881 --> 02:23:36,960
we do it in the same area.

5423
02:23:36,961 --> 02:23:39,840
All those hotels had Austin
right that south by southwest.

5424
02:23:40,080 --> 02:23:40,261
Yeah.

5425
02:23:40,261 --> 02:23:43,110
Maybe we could do it six months after
when south by southwest was there.

5426
02:23:43,110 --> 02:23:44,340
So we don't compete with them at all.

5427
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:47,070
And I'm Boston desk squad festival.

5428
02:23:47,250 --> 02:23:49,500
When is south by southwest or a month ago.

5429
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,510
A month ago.

5430
02:23:50,510 --> 02:23:51,420
So it's a what?

5431
02:23:51,421 --> 02:23:52,080
April.

5432
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:55,500
What do you worry about competing
with south by Southwest Damien?

5433
02:23:55,590 --> 02:23:56,131
The first of all,

5434
02:23:56,131 --> 02:23:57,990
you can't do it anywhere near
them because first of all,

5435
02:23:58,140 --> 02:23:59,370
they're way more established.

5436
02:23:59,371 --> 02:24:01,020
They're going to eat
up all the hotel rooms.

5437
02:24:01,430 --> 02:24:02,910
I mean if you really wanted to do,

5438
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:05,160
but then you would have
to like organize it man,

5439
02:24:05,161 --> 02:24:06,570
and then you'd have to pay the bands.

5440
02:24:06,571 --> 02:24:09,010
Like if you have bands performing that,

5441
02:24:10,730 --> 02:24:10,920
yeah,

5442
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:11,940
you get to hire a tour manager.

5443
02:24:11,941 --> 02:24:13,140
We'd have to figure out who would be,

5444
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:13,291
I mean,

5445
02:24:13,291 --> 02:24:15,030
if we're going to have a
desk squad comedy festival,

5446
02:24:15,031 --> 02:24:17,660
we'd have to be really picky
about who we let go on stage too.

5447
02:24:17,930 --> 02:24:19,000
You know they're going to die.

5448
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:21,270
They're going to represent us.

5449
02:24:21,470 --> 02:24:22,171
If it's three days,

5450
02:24:22,171 --> 02:24:23,850
we just use all the same
guys who always use,

5451
02:24:23,851 --> 02:24:24,360
but there's like,

5452
02:24:24,360 --> 02:24:27,690
we have like 30 people that we use
all the time and you just in different

5453
02:24:27,691 --> 02:24:28,680
rotations and stuff,

5454
02:24:28,681 --> 02:24:31,440
we made it a big festival and
people got to plan for it.

5455
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:32,580
They would want to do this,

5456
02:24:32,581 --> 02:24:32,731
you know,

5457
02:24:32,731 --> 02:24:34,050
it'd be about 30 people.

5458
02:24:34,051 --> 02:24:36,270
We don't have 30 people that
are good enough to represent us.

5459
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:37,470
You start grabbing neck,

5460
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:37,861
telling him like,

5461
02:24:37,861 --> 02:24:38,251
hey,

5462
02:24:38,251 --> 02:24:41,490
like could they be Stephen is easy's
and all the Freddy Lockharts and he'd be

5463
02:24:41,491 --> 02:24:41,611
like,

5464
02:24:41,611 --> 02:24:41,731
Hey,

5465
02:24:41,731 --> 02:24:43,350
do you want to calm 30 though?

5466
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:45,300
I don't think it's 30 I'm sorry.

5467
02:24:46,050 --> 02:24:47,040
What do you think per,

5468
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:47,430
I mean,

5469
02:24:47,430 --> 02:24:48,180
who are you talking about?

5470
02:24:48,180 --> 02:24:49,650
We're talking about little Esther,

5471
02:24:49,651 --> 02:24:51,150
you know we're talking about like the all,

5472
02:24:51,210 --> 02:24:55,560
all the guys and then you might even
find that if it's a big enough thing that

5473
02:24:55,561 --> 02:24:58,260
like there's just people that
want to hang out for a weekend,

5474
02:24:58,261 --> 02:24:59,250
like a party style.

5475
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:01,620
And so you might get like maybe
like Greg Fitzsimmons would be like,

5476
02:25:01,630 --> 02:25:01,831
hey,

5477
02:25:01,831 --> 02:25:02,641
I want to come to this,

5478
02:25:02,641 --> 02:25:02,851
you know,

5479
02:25:02,851 --> 02:25:03,480
and shit like that.

5480
02:25:03,480 --> 02:25:04,470
Maybe he would,

5481
02:25:04,471 --> 02:25:06,030
he would want to get
paid and as he should.

5482
02:25:06,060 --> 02:25:06,571
Absolutely.

5483
02:25:06,571 --> 02:25:07,280
We'll make it fun.

5484
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:08,400
Make it like a festival.

5485
02:25:08,401 --> 02:25:08,771
But then what?

5486
02:25:08,771 --> 02:25:11,550
You had different shots so they
could see different people twice.

5487
02:25:11,830 --> 02:25:12,151
Yeah,

5488
02:25:12,151 --> 02:25:13,140
I guess they would have to,

5489
02:25:13,141 --> 02:25:14,780
if they went to different shows it would.

5490
02:25:14,781 --> 02:25:17,420
It would have to be some people
on certain shows and the god,

5491
02:25:17,430 --> 02:25:18,360
it sounds like a lot of work,

5492
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:19,560
but it'd be kind of fun.

5493
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:20,970
Maybe something we could think of,

5494
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:21,210
you know?

5495
02:25:21,210 --> 02:25:21,540
I mean,

5496
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:21,841
look,

5497
02:25:21,841 --> 02:25:24,020
if the fucking insane
clown posse can pull up my

5498
02:25:24,020 --> 02:25:24,853
daughter off,

5499
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:25,600
we could pull it up.

5500
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:27,430
Death squads shows at a comedy festival,

5501
02:25:27,431 --> 02:25:27,581
you know,

5502
02:25:27,581 --> 02:25:27,971
the really,

5503
02:25:27,971 --> 02:25:31,990
the best way to do it really would be
to make it super simple and started off

5504
02:25:31,991 --> 02:25:33,820
simple and as easy as possible.

5505
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:36,520
Try it out one year and then let it build,

5506
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:37,181
you know?

5507
02:25:37,181 --> 02:25:38,320
Then the next year moving to Vegas,

5508
02:25:38,760 --> 02:25:40,390
we try and and Pasadena one year,

5509
02:25:40,510 --> 02:25:42,100
maybe we try it this year in passing away.

5510
02:25:42,101 --> 02:25:44,520
That's what you do here when another car,

5511
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,480
you don't have to pay for
hotels for almost any comic.

5512
02:25:47,230 --> 02:25:48,040
How about that?

5513
02:25:48,040 --> 02:25:50,050
How about we do it ice house,

5514
02:25:50,051 --> 02:25:54,600
continual ice house shows and we'll have
like bands go up and perform at the ice

5515
02:25:54,601 --> 02:25:55,090
house.

5516
02:25:55,090 --> 02:25:58,180
We'll have two shows going on at the same
time with the ice house and just take

5517
02:25:58,181 --> 02:26:02,110
over the club for like a whole week
and have all of our friends come in and

5518
02:26:02,111 --> 02:26:02,260
vote.

5519
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:03,030
It's so hard.

5520
02:26:03,030 --> 02:26:04,220
[inaudible] the fuck out of it.

5521
02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:05,860
Have all of our friends come in that we,

5522
02:26:05,861 --> 02:26:06,131
you know,

5523
02:26:06,131 --> 02:26:09,430
all of our friends like from out of town
that we know that our great comics that

5524
02:26:09,431 --> 02:26:10,760
maybe live in be here.

5525
02:26:11,470 --> 02:26:11,950
Yeah.

5526
02:26:11,950 --> 02:26:12,511
Planning to be here.

5527
02:26:12,511 --> 02:26:15,340
I'm bringing Stan hope and
pay for him and you know,

5528
02:26:15,341 --> 02:26:15,501
and,

5529
02:26:15,501 --> 02:26:19,410
and it put them up in a hotel and give
them the door 100% of the door and just

5530
02:26:19,411 --> 02:26:20,850
and pumped the show up and,

5531
02:26:20,851 --> 02:26:21,461
and set it up.

5532
02:26:21,461 --> 02:26:25,180
So it's both profitable for guys
to be and it looks like it's fun.

5533
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:27,430
And the whole time we'd broadcast,

5534
02:26:27,580 --> 02:26:27,880
you know,

5535
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:31,420
whatever the type of door we want to have
two things set at one we're going to,

5536
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:32,920
we want to have set up something.

5537
02:26:32,921 --> 02:26:34,240
So in the podcast room,

5538
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:35,560
at the Ice House,

5539
02:26:35,561 --> 02:26:36,610
we can see the stage.

5540
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:37,720
That's step one.

5541
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:40,620
Step two is we're going
to broadcast to podcast.

5542
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:41,980
All the people waiting in line.

5543
02:26:42,130 --> 02:26:45,550
So while the people were waiting in line
as they're going and we'll be doing the

5544
02:26:45,551 --> 02:26:48,490
podcast with speakers outside
of that little courtyard area.

5545
02:26:48,880 --> 02:26:51,790
So that will be going on
and then we'll have shows,

5546
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:53,680
we'll have bands that can go up.

5547
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:54,580
I love it that they made,

5548
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:58,420
they made the bar room of Lovitz it
should pull down a screen and they show

5549
02:26:58,450 --> 02:27:00,340
what's going on on that
big screen on stage.

5550
02:27:00,610 --> 02:27:01,421
That's not a bad show.

5551
02:27:01,421 --> 02:27:03,920
The podcast or you can drink
and just the bar area where we,

5552
02:27:03,921 --> 02:27:06,250
where would you do that outside there?

5553
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:08,403
I mean the uh,

5554
02:27:08,420 --> 02:27:09,130
ice house again,

5555
02:27:09,130 --> 02:27:10,870
you can do it outside and
that little bit of new area.

5556
02:27:10,980 --> 02:27:11,200
Yeah.

5557
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:12,460
To everybody would go to smoke anywhere.

5558
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:12,970
Sure.

5559
02:27:12,970 --> 02:27:14,290
Why not put a big screen up there,

5560
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:15,153
right.

5561
02:27:16,530 --> 02:27:18,700
Like you could talk to like that one,

5562
02:27:18,750 --> 02:27:22,960
that whole property because that whole
building that is owned by the same person

5563
02:27:22,961 --> 02:27:24,700
that owns like that
parking lot that's right.

5564
02:27:24,730 --> 02:27:25,520
Connected to it.

5565
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:28,540
And if we were to like close
that off and then make it like,

5566
02:27:28,660 --> 02:27:28,871
you know,

5567
02:27:28,871 --> 02:27:30,250
different states upsides,

5568
02:27:30,720 --> 02:27:32,760
summer podcast,

5569
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:35,840
broadcast the podcast to the parking
lot and just have pulled up your own

5570
02:27:35,841 --> 02:27:36,251
chairs.

5571
02:27:36,251 --> 02:27:39,060
You need certain permits to do that
though cause you could disturb other

5572
02:27:39,070 --> 02:27:40,980
businesses and you'll
disturb the neighborhood.

5573
02:27:40,981 --> 02:27:42,640
Had that permission with
all those businesses.

5574
02:27:42,641 --> 02:27:43,780
I don't think you could do that.

5575
02:27:43,810 --> 02:27:44,261
I don't think.

5576
02:27:44,261 --> 02:27:46,840
I think you know that first of
all that's always in the park.

5577
02:27:47,090 --> 02:27:48,060
Tentative license.

5578
02:27:48,090 --> 02:27:48,191
Yeah.

5579
02:27:48,191 --> 02:27:49,990
But that's a movie and it's in a park.

5580
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:50,980
This isn't a part,

5581
02:27:50,981 --> 02:27:54,220
it's a parking lot and it's right
next to people's businesses.

5582
02:27:54,430 --> 02:27:58,480
Either would hear it for sure if honey
honey is out there jamming carry like a

5583
02:27:58,481 --> 02:27:59,300
live band.

5584
02:27:59,300 --> 02:28:01,090
There's a festival that's in Columbus,

5585
02:28:01,091 --> 02:28:01,924
Ohio.

5586
02:28:02,030 --> 02:28:05,320
It's the whole weekend called
calm fast co what it is,

5587
02:28:05,321 --> 02:28:08,380
it's community festival where everybody
in the community gets together and

5588
02:28:08,381 --> 02:28:11,280
volunteers time work
and making a festival.

5589
02:28:11,281 --> 02:28:13,080
So like a lot of my friends
would like sit there and be,

5590
02:28:13,220 --> 02:28:16,870
you know the people that sell beer
all day and they just do it for free.

5591
02:28:17,050 --> 02:28:17,883
And it's just,

5592
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:21,620
there's three different stages for
different stages and it's just music and,

5593
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:22,100
and in

5594
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:25,230
poetry and there's girls
walking around naked and uh,

5595
02:28:25,240 --> 02:28:25,670
and it's,

5596
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:28,730
and it's just people go there with tents
and like pretty much just hang out at

5597
02:28:28,731 --> 02:28:30,050
this park the whole weekend.

5598
02:28:30,490 --> 02:28:30,911
And,

5599
02:28:30,911 --> 02:28:31,551
and it was just like,

5600
02:28:31,551 --> 02:28:33,230
imagine if it was
something like that where,

5601
02:28:33,231 --> 02:28:35,570
cause like your fan base is so like,

5602
02:28:35,870 --> 02:28:36,530
uh,

5603
02:28:36,530 --> 02:28:39,320
like that kind of like
outdoorsy mushrooms,

5604
02:28:39,321 --> 02:28:40,550
nature kind of,

5605
02:28:40,580 --> 02:28:40,970
you know,

5606
02:28:40,970 --> 02:28:43,550
they like music and Jimmy Hendrickson,

5607
02:28:44,130 --> 02:28:47,280
we could eventually do it
someplace like that someplace cool.

5608
02:28:47,281 --> 02:28:49,890
But we would have to make sure that
there's enough combinations for all the

5609
02:28:49,891 --> 02:28:51,300
people that were invited to come down.

5610
02:28:51,600 --> 02:28:51,811
Right.

5611
02:28:51,811 --> 02:28:52,201
You know,

5612
02:28:52,201 --> 02:28:55,890
it would be tricky and we would also have
to make sure that we could safely get

5613
02:28:55,891 --> 02:28:57,480
all the artists there and put up,

5614
02:28:57,481 --> 02:28:58,890
put them up and places.

5615
02:28:59,070 --> 02:29:00,820
That's why starting an off in Pasadena,

5616
02:29:00,821 --> 02:29:03,390
it would be super easy
because everyone's local.

5617
02:29:03,570 --> 02:29:06,870
We could have all the local guys go
off and people that want to come here,

5618
02:29:06,871 --> 02:29:07,441
they can come here.

5619
02:29:07,441 --> 02:29:08,700
It's easy to get to Pasadena.

5620
02:29:08,730 --> 02:29:10,050
You can come here from
all over the country.

5621
02:29:10,230 --> 02:29:12,480
We can set up a 10 at comm fest this year.

5622
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:13,820
What's confessed?

5623
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:14,401
That festival.

5624
02:29:14,401 --> 02:29:15,234
I was just telling him that.

5625
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:15,750
Yeah,

5626
02:29:15,750 --> 02:29:16,583
I don't have a comedy team.

5627
02:29:16,830 --> 02:29:19,650
I don't think we need to
bring in people like that.

5628
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:20,160
I think.

5629
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:22,530
I think we advertise to our own people.

5630
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:26,040
We advertise to everybody who follows me
on Twitter and everybody who follows me

5631
02:29:26,041 --> 02:29:29,350
on Facebook pod lead up time.

5632
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:30,420
Yeah,

5633
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:32,560
this is the week you're gonna want
to make your hotel reservations.

5634
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:34,080
Before I do that,

5635
02:29:34,081 --> 02:29:36,510
we could do that now and get thousands
of people to come from all over the

5636
02:29:36,511 --> 02:29:36,901
country.

5637
02:29:36,901 --> 02:29:37,390
I have no idea.

5638
02:29:37,390 --> 02:29:40,800
There's a bunch of shows throughout the
week leaving that two shows a night.

5639
02:29:40,801 --> 02:29:41,634
Pretty much to say the,

5640
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:44,370
if you do doing a couple of locations
lighthouse on somewhere else,

5641
02:29:44,371 --> 02:29:46,270
the ice house is a great
place because it's,

5642
02:29:46,271 --> 02:29:46,560
look,

5643
02:29:46,560 --> 02:29:48,780
it's close to lax and
people can get there.

5644
02:29:48,781 --> 02:29:49,890
They can get rental cars,

5645
02:29:49,891 --> 02:29:50,611
they can stay.

5646
02:29:50,611 --> 02:29:51,660
It's not a far drive.

5647
02:29:51,661 --> 02:29:52,710
You've got an navigation system.

5648
02:29:52,711 --> 02:29:53,670
It's not hard to swing,

5649
02:29:54,090 --> 02:29:54,420
you know,

5650
02:29:54,420 --> 02:29:54,661
it's,

5651
02:29:54,661 --> 02:29:55,920
it's totally feasible.

5652
02:29:55,921 --> 02:29:57,780
And we have the best
relationship with that club,

5653
02:29:57,960 --> 02:29:58,440
the,

5654
02:29:58,440 --> 02:29:58,741
you know,

5655
02:29:58,741 --> 02:30:00,090
as far as clubs around,

5656
02:30:00,120 --> 02:30:01,230
and there's two rooms there,

5657
02:30:01,590 --> 02:30:05,220
so we could have two rooms running
simultaneously and just keep doing shows.

5658
02:30:05,220 --> 02:30:07,020
We could do like two and
three shows at night.

5659
02:30:07,021 --> 02:30:08,220
Like we could have an early show,

5660
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:12,000
we can have a bunch of different shit
going on or having music side stage.

5661
02:30:12,370 --> 02:30:15,110
Just how many times mad
security for nutty people.

5662
02:30:15,150 --> 02:30:17,730
So many nutty people that been
showing up at the icehouse Layla.

5663
02:30:18,690 --> 02:30:18,901
Oh,

5664
02:30:18,901 --> 02:30:20,130
I had a girl starts screaming out to it,

5665
02:30:20,131 --> 02:30:21,420
loves move during my show on the horror.

5666
02:30:21,480 --> 02:30:23,490
Did you just run up and
shove it in her mouth?

5667
02:30:24,190 --> 02:30:24,871
How much do you love me?

5668
02:30:24,871 --> 02:30:25,300
But that's why.

5669
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:26,520
So I can talk.

5670
02:30:26,521 --> 02:30:27,091
It was crazy.

5671
02:30:27,091 --> 02:30:27,451
And I was like,

5672
02:30:27,451 --> 02:30:28,260
what's wrong with you?

5673
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:29,093
You're going to be quiet.

5674
02:30:29,820 --> 02:30:30,960
So what happened after the show?

5675
02:30:30,961 --> 02:30:31,530
You're hanging out with her?

5676
02:30:31,530 --> 02:30:31,681
No,

5677
02:30:31,681 --> 02:30:32,820
I told her shut to leave eventually.

5678
02:30:32,850 --> 02:30:33,151
I was like,

5679
02:30:33,151 --> 02:30:36,450
I understand that she was weird or
something was on something she was on.

5680
02:30:36,451 --> 02:30:37,170
I love Ari.

5681
02:30:37,170 --> 02:30:38,180
I want some Judic.

5682
02:30:38,870 --> 02:30:40,770
Well stop just there by herself.

5683
02:30:41,220 --> 02:30:41,940
Well,

5684
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:42,780
how did it end?

5685
02:30:43,080 --> 02:30:43,531
I told her she,

5686
02:30:43,531 --> 02:30:47,550
I believe she was there by
herself there by they self is,

5687
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:48,393
I'm really sorry.

5688
02:30:49,530 --> 02:30:50,520
Good sign of crazy.

5689
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:51,540
Not always.

5690
02:30:51,630 --> 02:30:53,640
A lot of people come by
themselves that are very nice,

5691
02:30:53,641 --> 02:30:56,130
but occasionally it's a sign of crazy.

5692
02:30:56,820 --> 02:30:58,500
Sometimes you going anywhere by herself.

5693
02:30:58,501 --> 02:30:58,771
It's like,

5694
02:30:58,771 --> 02:30:59,100
what?

5695
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:00,300
What are you going to be up to right now?

5696
02:31:00,630 --> 02:31:01,380
Not always.

5697
02:31:01,380 --> 02:31:01,850
You know,

5698
02:31:01,850 --> 02:31:03,180
it could could mean you're cool.

5699
02:31:03,181 --> 02:31:05,460
I met some really cool people
that came to shows by themselves.

5700
02:31:05,910 --> 02:31:06,690
Nothing wrong with it.

5701
02:31:06,690 --> 02:31:09,710
It's not like a hard fast rule rogue fest.

5702
02:31:10,170 --> 02:31:13,800
But if you meet a girl though and she
comes to a show by herself that girls are

5703
02:31:13,801 --> 02:31:14,670
freak almost.

5704
02:31:15,150 --> 02:31:16,970
I'm by myself just hanging out

5705
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:19,793
half.

5706
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:24,030
So we would have to call this a the desk
squad festival or something like that

5707
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:27,690
to first we'd have to
figure out what to call it.

5708
02:31:28,350 --> 02:31:29,670
Like the insane clown posse.

5709
02:31:29,671 --> 02:31:30,301
They call their shit.

5710
02:31:30,301 --> 02:31:31,740
The gathering of the Juggalos.

5711
02:31:32,760 --> 02:31:34,440
We would not call it the
gathering of the Juggalos.

5712
02:31:34,470 --> 02:31:34,740
No,

5713
02:31:34,740 --> 02:31:35,521
we couldn't call it that.

5714
02:31:35,521 --> 02:31:37,190
They already have that damn it.

5715
02:31:37,230 --> 02:31:39,210
That would be so good for in
order to get people to come out.

5716
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:41,370
But death squad is going to give
people the wrong impression.

5717
02:31:41,610 --> 02:31:42,443
Oh yeah.

5718
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:44,790
Maybe we need to come up
with a name for the festival,

5719
02:31:44,791 --> 02:31:45,900
like a yearly name.

5720
02:31:46,290 --> 02:31:47,280
Just call it all of garden.

5721
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:49,140
Maybe the happy primate festival.

5722
02:31:50,620 --> 02:31:52,560
Most of all happy primary comedy,

5723
02:31:52,690 --> 02:31:53,100
but it's not,

5724
02:31:53,100 --> 02:31:55,730
it's not quite a comedy
festival bands too.

5725
02:31:56,130 --> 02:31:56,780
Oh,

5726
02:31:56,780 --> 02:31:57,800
and we would just get,

5727
02:31:58,010 --> 02:32:00,880
just like primates do,

5728
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:03,780
you'll get like some music club
and Pasadena to show those shows.

5729
02:32:04,250 --> 02:32:04,531
Now.

5730
02:32:04,531 --> 02:32:06,710
We would do those at the
ice house to put it put us.

5731
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,130
There'll be easy to put up.

5732
02:32:08,131 --> 02:32:09,030
Like if a honey honey,

5733
02:32:09,031 --> 02:32:10,020
they could play at the,

5734
02:32:10,021 --> 02:32:10,500
um,

5735
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:11,520
at the icehouse easy.

5736
02:32:11,550 --> 02:32:13,030
I'm sure they've had
bands playing that place.

5737
02:32:13,031 --> 02:32:14,400
I have a jumped off the stage.

5738
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:15,330
Yeah.

5739
02:32:15,330 --> 02:32:15,850
Yeah.

5740
02:32:15,850 --> 02:32:16,770
There's not much room.

5741
02:32:17,370 --> 02:32:18,203
Yeah.

5742
02:32:18,900 --> 02:32:19,890
I don't know how they would do that.

5743
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:20,611
How much room is there?

5744
02:32:20,611 --> 02:32:21,900
Do you think there's room for a drum set?

5745
02:32:22,050 --> 02:32:22,261
No,

5746
02:32:22,261 --> 02:32:23,010
not on the stage.

5747
02:32:23,010 --> 02:32:23,610
Absolutely not.

5748
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:24,480
No Way.

5749
02:32:24,510 --> 02:32:24,900
No.

5750
02:32:24,900 --> 02:32:25,260
No.

5751
02:32:25,260 --> 02:32:26,310
Absolutely not.

5752
02:32:26,750 --> 02:32:29,860
There would be take up the
entire state drums though.

5753
02:32:29,880 --> 02:32:32,760
There's some of their best things
they do is just him and her,

5754
02:32:32,761 --> 02:32:37,110
him playing guitar and her
playing Banjo Acoustic set.

5755
02:32:37,200 --> 02:32:37,800
Yeah.

5756
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:38,341
That's better.

5757
02:32:38,341 --> 02:32:39,030
Anyway man,

5758
02:32:39,030 --> 02:32:41,280
the Acoustic Shit they did
on my podcast was brilliant.

5759
02:32:41,480 --> 02:32:43,860
They don't do like 15 to 20 minutes
at the end of 30 minutes or 40.

5760
02:32:43,910 --> 02:32:45,550
She's not like she,

5761
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:47,250
she has a real voice man.

5762
02:32:47,251 --> 02:32:48,810
That chick has a real voice.

5763
02:32:48,811 --> 02:32:49,380
Like that's,

5764
02:32:49,380 --> 02:32:50,830
that's a legitimate voice.

5765
02:32:50,831 --> 02:32:55,380
So it's not like she doesn't need any
effects or any fakery she really can sing.

5766
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:56,820
I would do a storyteller show,

5767
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:58,490
get crushed on dos to deal with.

5768
02:32:59,310 --> 02:32:59,551
Yeah,

5769
02:32:59,551 --> 02:33:00,384
we can do that too.

5770
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,100
That could be a part of it.

5771
02:33:02,130 --> 02:33:02,850
Absolutely.

5772
02:33:02,850 --> 02:33:03,683
It's a good idea.

5773
02:33:04,110 --> 02:33:04,390
Yeah.

5774
02:33:04,390 --> 02:33:07,390
Just different themes or different
shortage situations for like that.

5775
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:08,521
And you know what,

5776
02:33:08,521 --> 02:33:09,354
we should also

5777
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:12,330
ask topics.

5778
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:13,590
That's exactly what I was going to say.

5779
02:33:13,591 --> 02:33:14,670
Question in that answer.

5780
02:33:14,850 --> 02:33:15,840
We should do a,

5781
02:33:15,860 --> 02:33:15,951
uh,

5782
02:33:15,951 --> 02:33:16,771
an entire show.

5783
02:33:16,771 --> 02:33:19,680
Like we did a little bit of it at
the end of the show in Atlanta,

5784
02:33:19,710 --> 02:33:22,200
but it was more like mocking
people for the stupid questions.

5785
02:33:22,201 --> 02:33:23,700
And more moon landing hoax,

5786
02:33:23,701 --> 02:33:24,540
conspiracy talk.

5787
02:33:25,170 --> 02:33:26,370
I want to hear it from his own mouth.

5788
02:33:26,371 --> 02:33:27,091
This guy goes,

5789
02:33:27,091 --> 02:33:27,481
well,

5790
02:33:27,481 --> 02:33:28,980
I do know that we went to the moon.

5791
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:31,680
I love just saying that.

5792
02:33:31,681 --> 02:33:31,861
Well,

5793
02:33:31,861 --> 02:33:32,700
I do know.

5794
02:33:32,860 --> 02:33:34,220
I'm just saying it louder.

5795
02:33:35,910 --> 02:33:36,451
What does that mean?

5796
02:33:36,451 --> 02:33:38,970
Silly 1969 you know what happened?

5797
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:40,020
No matter what the argument?

5798
02:33:40,050 --> 02:33:40,470
Well,

5799
02:33:40,470 --> 02:33:41,290
I just know.

5800
02:33:41,290 --> 02:33:41,610
Yeah,

5801
02:33:41,610 --> 02:33:42,320
so you're just hanging out.

5802
02:33:42,320 --> 02:33:43,081
Just on talking about.

5803
02:33:43,081 --> 02:33:43,741
No one knows.

5804
02:33:43,741 --> 02:33:46,320
I mean we can kind of assume
most likely that happened.

5805
02:33:46,321 --> 02:33:47,820
I'm pretty sure Kennedy
got shot in the head.

5806
02:33:47,821 --> 02:33:47,941
I'm,

5807
02:33:47,941 --> 02:33:49,350
I'm 99% positive,

5808
02:33:49,351 --> 02:33:51,400
but I wouldn't even say I'm
100% positive with that.

5809
02:33:52,150 --> 02:33:53,240
Fuck knows.

5810
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:55,260
There's God damn dark world.

5811
02:33:55,261 --> 02:33:55,551
We live.

5812
02:33:55,551 --> 02:33:56,520
We'll take that argument too far.

5813
02:33:56,521 --> 02:33:57,031
Sometimes they're like,

5814
02:33:57,031 --> 02:33:57,151
well,

5815
02:33:57,151 --> 02:34:00,750
how did you even know there
was a Kennedy world's real?

5816
02:34:00,930 --> 02:34:03,770
How do we not know that you are not
living in a commune or something?

5817
02:34:04,920 --> 02:34:05,221
By the way,

5818
02:34:05,221 --> 02:34:06,240
I thought that was really hilarious.

5819
02:34:06,241 --> 02:34:10,920
I saw a video of you explaining to people
how to download the bone zone and you

5820
02:34:10,921 --> 02:34:11,311
did it.

5821
02:34:11,311 --> 02:34:16,311
I sent a handicapped person as a person
because I don't know how to do it.

5822
02:34:17,260 --> 02:34:19,660
One Brendan Walsh was
complaining that people,

5823
02:34:19,700 --> 02:34:21,520
we're having a hard time
finding his podcast.

5824
02:34:21,530 --> 02:34:22,221
It's pretty much,

5825
02:34:22,221 --> 02:34:26,690
I showed Brennan how to do it and he made
a big deal about it on another podcast

5826
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:27,140
and it's like,

5827
02:34:27,140 --> 02:34:27,973
ah,

5828
02:34:28,160 --> 02:34:29,100
come on here.

5829
02:34:29,101 --> 02:34:31,220
Let me do it real slow again for you

5830
02:34:31,330 --> 02:34:32,020
to show people how to,

5831
02:34:32,020 --> 02:34:32,420
how to,

5832
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:33,610
how to download?

5833
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:34,810
Yeah,

5834
02:34:34,810 --> 02:34:35,530
or just,

5835
02:34:35,530 --> 02:34:35,711
well,

5836
02:34:35,711 --> 02:34:37,630
I think he wants it to be under his name.

5837
02:34:37,631 --> 02:34:38,740
Is that what it is now?

5838
02:34:38,741 --> 02:34:39,061
He's just,

5839
02:34:39,061 --> 02:34:39,400
look,

5840
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:43,270
people see that the kids search bone zone
and it comes up on iTunes and so I was

5841
02:34:43,271 --> 02:34:43,421
like,

5842
02:34:43,421 --> 02:34:43,541
well,

5843
02:34:43,541 --> 02:34:44,830
let me show you how to do it,

5844
02:34:45,310 --> 02:34:46,390
but you can't show the people.

5845
02:34:46,391 --> 02:34:47,260
It's the people searching.

5846
02:34:47,290 --> 02:34:47,980
That's what you have to commit.

5847
02:34:47,980 --> 02:34:48,700
It's not pregnant.

5848
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:52,660
How many people that are in your little
network get upset that you have the

5849
02:34:52,661 --> 02:34:56,500
network as the name of their show and
then they're shown next instead of the way

5850
02:34:56,501 --> 02:34:58,180
everybody else has to think out of.

5851
02:34:58,240 --> 02:34:59,073
Let's say

5852
02:34:59,870 --> 02:35:01,760
if there was a 100,000 people,

5853
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:04,790
I think I hear it maybe
two times on Twitter.

5854
02:35:05,380 --> 02:35:05,580
No,

5855
02:35:05,580 --> 02:35:05,710
no,

5856
02:35:05,710 --> 02:35:05,801
no,

5857
02:35:05,801 --> 02:35:05,870
no,

5858
02:35:05,870 --> 02:35:05,931
no,

5859
02:35:05,931 --> 02:35:06,120
no.

5860
02:35:06,120 --> 02:35:07,120
I'm talking about the people,

5861
02:35:07,220 --> 02:35:09,240
the people that host their shows.

5862
02:35:09,770 --> 02:35:11,400
How many of them want to
change it to their own name?

5863
02:35:12,360 --> 02:35:13,410
It must all of them.

5864
02:35:13,411 --> 02:35:13,711
No,

5865
02:35:13,711 --> 02:35:14,544
I don't think so.

5866
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:15,480
No.

5867
02:35:15,480 --> 02:35:15,900
No.

5868
02:35:15,900 --> 02:35:16,870
I would say none of them now.

5869
02:35:17,250 --> 02:35:17,670
Right now.

5870
02:35:17,670 --> 02:35:18,001
Come on.

5871
02:35:18,001 --> 02:35:18,461
Brennan was,

5872
02:35:18,461 --> 02:35:21,560
doesn't want it to be in his name and
then have you as the network second.

5873
02:35:21,561 --> 02:35:21,660
Yeah.

5874
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:22,200
No,

5875
02:35:22,200 --> 02:35:25,140
I mean they look what happened
with Freddie Lockhart and
Freddy Lockhart did it.

5876
02:35:25,200 --> 02:35:25,920
He,

5877
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:26,670
you know,

5878
02:35:26,670 --> 02:35:28,380
he got lost and so he came back.

5879
02:35:28,570 --> 02:35:28,931
No,

5880
02:35:28,931 --> 02:35:29,110
no,

5881
02:35:29,110 --> 02:35:29,261
no,

5882
02:35:29,261 --> 02:35:29,381
no,

5883
02:35:29,381 --> 02:35:29,531
no,

5884
02:35:29,531 --> 02:35:29,651
no,

5885
02:35:29,651 --> 02:35:29,801
no,

5886
02:35:29,801 --> 02:35:29,981
no.

5887
02:35:29,981 --> 02:35:30,280
First,

5888
02:35:30,280 --> 02:35:30,731
first of all,

5889
02:35:30,731 --> 02:35:31,480
Freddy didn't.

5890
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:32,313
He left you.

5891
02:35:32,320 --> 02:35:35,770
He stopped doing it and when
he left it wasn't that he was,

5892
02:35:35,980 --> 02:35:39,550
you know that he went under his name
and that's why people couldn't find him.

5893
02:35:39,820 --> 02:35:40,660
It's like he really,

5894
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:42,350
nobody gave a shit about it.

5895
02:35:42,351 --> 02:35:42,530
Anyway,

5896
02:35:42,530 --> 02:35:45,160
you said you were going
to find a way how people,

5897
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:45,481
no,

5898
02:35:45,481 --> 02:35:45,640
no.

5899
02:35:45,640 --> 02:35:49,120
It has a color to all podcasts now that
know Freddie left because he wanted to

5900
02:35:49,121 --> 02:35:50,050
do it on his own.

5901
02:35:50,051 --> 02:35:52,750
And then when I'm saying is that when
he did that and then we could find his

5902
02:35:52,751 --> 02:35:56,530
podcast anymore because no
one was listening to anymore
because that's the only

5903
02:35:56,531 --> 02:35:58,360
because Freddie had not and he said,

5904
02:35:58,361 --> 02:35:58,820
dude,

5905
02:35:58,820 --> 02:35:59,591
not publicized it.

5906
02:35:59,591 --> 02:36:00,610
Well he didn't do a good job.

5907
02:36:00,700 --> 02:36:03,250
We talked about it on this
part going on podcasts,

5908
02:36:03,251 --> 02:36:03,910
we tweeted it,

5909
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:05,830
I even retweeted him tons of times.

5910
02:36:05,870 --> 02:36:06,270
No it is,

5911
02:36:06,270 --> 02:36:08,650
it is an extra step if people,

5912
02:36:08,651 --> 02:36:11,500
you consider the numbers of people that
are listening to yours but in order for

5913
02:36:11,501 --> 02:36:13,810
him to have it go off on his own,

5914
02:36:13,811 --> 02:36:14,620
think about that.

5915
02:36:14,620 --> 02:36:18,580
He was doing yours for so long and it's
still hadn't developed a name where he

5916
02:36:18,581 --> 02:36:19,900
could have his phone number one

5917
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:20,701
podcasts on desk.

5918
02:36:20,701 --> 02:36:22,710
Why when it left and it went to 170

5919
02:36:23,450 --> 02:36:24,070
but you know,

5920
02:36:24,070 --> 02:36:26,030
so you understand what I'm saying?

5921
02:36:26,060 --> 02:36:27,350
Know what I'm saying?

5922
02:36:27,351 --> 02:36:31,100
Is he in the all the time he's doing
it with you still hadn't gotten

5923
02:36:31,101 --> 02:36:31,934
independent.

5924
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:33,260
He was still attached to your name.

5925
02:36:33,410 --> 02:36:37,310
So it's almost like he wasted time
doing a good podcast under your name and

5926
02:36:37,311 --> 02:36:38,780
never got his name out there.

5927
02:36:38,840 --> 02:36:40,700
So when his name got out there on its own,

5928
02:36:40,760 --> 02:36:42,410
it flopped because no one knew about it.

5929
02:36:42,890 --> 02:36:44,450
He had been doing all this,

5930
02:36:44,630 --> 02:36:47,120
all this podcasting and spending
all this time developing this,

5931
02:36:47,390 --> 02:36:51,440
this sort of a a bunch of fans to follow
him and he couldn't take it with them.

5932
02:36:51,830 --> 02:36:53,420
Whereas if he just did it on his own,

5933
02:36:53,510 --> 02:36:55,280
whatever he built up
would have been his own.

5934
02:36:55,281 --> 02:36:56,114
It would have stuck with them.

5935
02:36:56,150 --> 02:37:00,230
[inaudible] do you not make sense?

5936
02:37:00,410 --> 02:37:00,690
Yeah.

5937
02:37:00,690 --> 02:37:03,600
Do you know how many podcasts that
there's comics out there that you've never

5938
02:37:03,601 --> 02:37:04,411
heard of in your life?

5939
02:37:04,411 --> 02:37:05,970
Did you know Mark Ellis had two podcasts?

5940
02:37:06,290 --> 02:37:06,431
Well,

5941
02:37:06,431 --> 02:37:06,591
yeah.

5942
02:37:06,591 --> 02:37:08,120
Well Mark Ellis is not a famous comedian.

5943
02:37:08,750 --> 02:37:08,991
You know,

5944
02:37:08,991 --> 02:37:09,681
Freddy Lockhart,

5945
02:37:09,681 --> 02:37:12,680
first of all was on a television show
and he's been on our podcast many,

5946
02:37:12,681 --> 02:37:13,341
many times.

5947
02:37:13,341 --> 02:37:16,640
And you know Mark Ellis the most would
be nice if people could search for his

5948
02:37:16,641 --> 02:37:17,060
name.

5949
02:37:17,060 --> 02:37:17,890
Yeah,

5950
02:37:17,890 --> 02:37:18,440
well they can,

5951
02:37:18,440 --> 02:37:19,310
they can search for his name.

5952
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:21,800
The real thing is like the question is,

5953
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:23,810
do you do it the way Adam Carolla does it,

5954
02:37:23,811 --> 02:37:24,591
where he has,

5955
02:37:24,591 --> 02:37:25,041
you know,

5956
02:37:25,041 --> 02:37:26,630
like someone's whatever,

5957
02:37:26,631 --> 02:37:30,460
the like Penn Sunday school and then
underneath that it says ace broadcasting.

5958
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:30,560
Oh,

5959
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:34,220
so he has it in a secondary
position and he's allows the,

5960
02:37:34,230 --> 02:37:38,120
the person's name of their podcast that's
first and he's just the production arm

5961
02:37:38,121 --> 02:37:38,370
of it.

5962
02:37:38,370 --> 02:37:39,230
You can build up on it.

5963
02:37:39,620 --> 02:37:40,640
Whereas Brian,

5964
02:37:40,670 --> 02:37:43,640
the way Brian does it is he
has a channel and you know,

5965
02:37:43,641 --> 02:37:47,150
it's the desk squad channel and then
everybody else's podcast is sort of

5966
02:37:47,151 --> 02:37:48,080
secondary to that.

5967
02:37:48,200 --> 02:37:49,700
It's actually the exact opposite.

5968
02:37:49,701 --> 02:37:50,301
It's collecting.

5969
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:51,680
It all builds up the network.

5970
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:56,740
It builds up the network as
a whole instead of building
up each individual as an

5971
02:37:56,901 --> 02:37:57,734
entity on their own.

5972
02:37:58,270 --> 02:37:59,200
Everyone helps each other.

5973
02:37:59,201 --> 02:38:00,580
If you're a big Sam Aaa fan,

5974
02:38:00,581 --> 02:38:01,640
you start listening to Sam triple,

5975
02:38:01,641 --> 02:38:03,070
you're going to start
listening to Brendon Walsh,

5976
02:38:03,090 --> 02:38:03,761
vice versa.

5977
02:38:03,761 --> 02:38:08,020
There's so many people that never knew
who Brennan Walsh was until they just

5978
02:38:08,021 --> 02:38:08,351
were like,

5979
02:38:08,351 --> 02:38:08,621
well,

5980
02:38:08,621 --> 02:38:09,850
I like Freddy Lockhart.

5981
02:38:09,851 --> 02:38:12,460
I'm going to start listening to Brendon
Walsh now because they're on the same

5982
02:38:12,461 --> 02:38:13,490
network and vice

5983
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:13,750
verse.

5984
02:38:13,750 --> 02:38:17,590
So that's also the case of what
people came onto this podcast.

5985
02:38:17,730 --> 02:38:17,851
Yeah,

5986
02:38:17,851 --> 02:38:19,890
but that's not the same reason that
there would be people who were like,

5987
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:20,041
oh,

5988
02:38:20,041 --> 02:38:20,874
I don't like,

5989
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:21,740
let's just say,

5990
02:38:21,740 --> 02:38:21,900
I mean,

5991
02:38:21,900 --> 02:38:22,660
here's an example.

5992
02:38:22,660 --> 02:38:23,010
Pockets,

5993
02:38:23,010 --> 02:38:24,750
they get annoyed and don't
listen to the same AAA.

5994
02:38:24,751 --> 02:38:26,070
Pacos here's an example.

5995
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:29,160
It turned off by this stuff
they're not into and they're like,

5996
02:38:29,161 --> 02:38:30,700
how much of this do I have
to sit through it before?

5997
02:38:31,010 --> 02:38:31,360
Don't do it.

5998
02:38:31,360 --> 02:38:32,220
Don't listen to it.

5999
02:38:32,470 --> 02:38:33,990
Do you have to listen
to every single wine?

6000
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:34,280
No.

6001
02:38:34,280 --> 02:38:35,490
It'd be just less lucky to see it.

6002
02:38:36,090 --> 02:38:36,923
Why you?

6003
02:38:36,930 --> 02:38:37,361
Let's look at the,

6004
02:38:37,361 --> 02:38:38,194
see it,

6005
02:38:38,830 --> 02:38:40,710
the six things that are there
and you only need to one of them.

6006
02:38:40,711 --> 02:38:43,140
It's just like you're less likely to
check in and see when there's updates.

6007
02:38:43,380 --> 02:38:43,621
Well,

6008
02:38:43,621 --> 02:38:43,921
my,

6009
02:38:43,921 --> 02:38:48,420
my only thought is that someone is
going to make sense of their own shit on

6010
02:38:48,421 --> 02:38:48,990
their own.

6011
02:38:48,990 --> 02:38:52,270
If they're doing their own show
on their own and they they brand,

6012
02:38:52,330 --> 02:38:54,000
I mean they start like Doug loves movies,

6013
02:38:54,030 --> 02:38:57,220
started out on his own captain on zone
and at this point in time we a lot of

6014
02:38:57,230 --> 02:39:02,230
shows that equity that he's built up
in that name and doing on on his own.

6015
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:04,230
And for a lot of these other guys,

6016
02:39:04,260 --> 02:39:07,040
they're building equity into the
desk squad name and it's not,

6017
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:08,390
it's not transplant to

6018
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:09,761
look at Ari superior,

6019
02:39:09,761 --> 02:39:10,620
look at Thompson Sigora.

6020
02:39:10,621 --> 02:39:12,210
There's ways that you can do it right?

6021
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:12,550
They were,

6022
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:15,210
they were lucky people like their
show and they're listening to it.

6023
02:39:15,211 --> 02:39:18,450
Aria is doing good on his
podcast and so is Tom Segura.

6024
02:39:18,510 --> 02:39:19,343
So what are you trying to say?

6025
02:39:19,500 --> 02:39:21,450
I'm just saying right at the end I left.

6026
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:21,841
I know,

6027
02:39:21,841 --> 02:39:22,321
that's what I'm saying.

6028
02:39:22,321 --> 02:39:23,011
I'm just saying that,

6029
02:39:23,011 --> 02:39:26,850
that I don't think that
like it works for everyone.

6030
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:27,773
I think.

6031
02:39:27,810 --> 02:39:28,810
And I think that like,

6032
02:39:28,830 --> 02:39:32,730
like I think of Sam Aaa wanted
to like move off a death squad.

6033
02:39:32,820 --> 02:39:35,250
He can totally do it and
he would probably survive.

6034
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:35,941
But like,

6035
02:39:35,941 --> 02:39:38,010
I don't think that it's,

6036
02:39:38,310 --> 02:39:39,940
it'd be nice if there's a
way to stay on dust squad,

6037
02:39:39,941 --> 02:39:42,340
but also have their own picture
for their podcast or something.

6038
02:39:42,910 --> 02:39:43,320
Yeah,

6039
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:43,970
they are pictures.

6040
02:39:43,970 --> 02:39:44,471
That's all.

6041
02:39:44,471 --> 02:39:45,500
I'll tell you what we're talking.

6042
02:39:45,520 --> 02:39:46,550
What reason why?

6043
02:39:46,551 --> 02:39:47,061
I mean you,

6044
02:39:47,061 --> 02:39:51,020
you actually made a bad example
because the reason why Ari and Dunkin,

6045
02:39:51,110 --> 02:39:54,350
well Dunkin especially did it
completely independently on his own,

6046
02:39:54,530 --> 02:39:56,210
but what got them,

6047
02:39:56,340 --> 02:39:59,600
what got them famous was being
on a podcast that was famous.

6048
02:39:59,601 --> 02:40:00,140
This one.

6049
02:40:00,140 --> 02:40:00,973
That's what got him,

6050
02:40:01,070 --> 02:40:04,460
that's 100% with not being on
the desk while they were like,

6051
02:40:04,461 --> 02:40:07,880
how many of your listeners
already do you think are not a,

6052
02:40:07,970 --> 02:40:08,340
uh,

6053
02:40:08,340 --> 02:40:09,110
of Joe Rogan?

6054
02:40:09,110 --> 02:40:09,640
I was like,

6055
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:09,920
oh,

6056
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:12,950
maybe like 1% maybe 2%.

6057
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:13,460
Yeah.

6058
02:40:13,460 --> 02:40:14,100
So a lot of people

6059
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:14,491
found me.

6060
02:40:14,491 --> 02:40:15,030
I don't mind it,

6061
02:40:15,030 --> 02:40:15,781
which is fine.

6062
02:40:15,781 --> 02:40:16,230
You know,

6063
02:40:16,230 --> 02:40:16,501
look,

6064
02:40:16,501 --> 02:40:18,090
we're all sort of different,

6065
02:40:18,091 --> 02:40:20,100
but likeminded folks will apologize it.

6066
02:40:20,101 --> 02:40:20,491
Like they're like,

6067
02:40:20,491 --> 02:40:20,880
I didn't mean,

6068
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:21,241
I'm sorry,

6069
02:40:21,241 --> 02:40:22,580
I didn't even know you do to stand up.

6070
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:23,391
I didn't want to even see you.

6071
02:40:23,391 --> 02:40:24,690
But before I hear it in the podcast,

6072
02:40:24,691 --> 02:40:24,841
I'm like,

6073
02:40:24,841 --> 02:40:25,270
I don't care.

6074
02:40:25,270 --> 02:40:26,460
That means you're here because of that.

6075
02:40:26,461 --> 02:40:27,030
That's awesome.

6076
02:40:27,030 --> 02:40:27,510
Yeah.

6077
02:40:27,510 --> 02:40:30,660
The biggest thing I wanted to stress
though is the reason why it's done as a

6078
02:40:30,661 --> 02:40:34,310
group is is is also looking
past what podcasts like.

6079
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:39,320
I don't really think that power through
numbers that in 20 years podcasts are

6080
02:40:39,751 --> 02:40:42,240
going to be fucking
kicking ass or anything,

6081
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:46,860
but one thing I do know that's coming
up is the the the basic future of cable

6082
02:40:46,861 --> 02:40:50,520
television and networks and stuff
or go into more of a streaming base,

6083
02:40:50,790 --> 02:40:55,080
a download based system like
Netflix or iTunes that that is true.

6084
02:40:55,110 --> 02:40:59,310
Like there's not going to be an NBC and
tenure independently of whether or not

6085
02:40:59,311 --> 02:41:01,680
you made your show the
first name or their show.

6086
02:41:01,681 --> 02:41:04,140
The first name when he was,

6087
02:41:04,141 --> 02:41:05,340
what I was saying is death squad.

6088
02:41:05,341 --> 02:41:05,521
Dot.

6089
02:41:05,521 --> 02:41:06,900
TV to me is like,

6090
02:41:06,901 --> 02:41:08,820
I'm kind of considering it more like a,

6091
02:41:09,070 --> 02:41:09,270
Eh,

6092
02:41:09,270 --> 02:41:10,290
this is a channel.

6093
02:41:10,291 --> 02:41:13,530
This is more than just just you're
listening to a podcast that your house,

6094
02:41:13,531 --> 02:41:17,400
this is like a TV show network where
each one of these shows are like a,

6095
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:20,520
it's like being on
death squad is like dot.

6096
02:41:20,521 --> 02:41:21,001
TV,

6097
02:41:21,001 --> 02:41:25,590
but it's like being on like MTV and each
one of these things underneath it as a

6098
02:41:25,591 --> 02:41:26,160
show.

6099
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:28,620
And so one of the biggest things
with like all the people saying,

6100
02:41:28,621 --> 02:41:28,861
you know,

6101
02:41:28,861 --> 02:41:32,370
like I want it to be separated into all
the different things on iTunes and all

6102
02:41:32,371 --> 02:41:32,760
that,

6103
02:41:32,760 --> 02:41:33,540
all that stuff.

6104
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:36,060
If you don't want to just
go to [inaudible] dot TV and
download what you want to

6105
02:41:36,061 --> 02:41:36,894
listen to.

6106
02:41:36,900 --> 02:41:40,800
We're making the show pages right
now where like as an example,

6107
02:41:40,801 --> 02:41:42,340
if you like the uh,

6108
02:41:42,390 --> 02:41:43,223
naughty show,

6109
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:44,610
it's going to have all the,

6110
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:45,160
the,

6111
02:41:45,160 --> 02:41:45,993
the,

6112
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:47,033
the naughty shows.

6113
02:41:47,110 --> 02:41:48,720
I was going to have an RSS feed,

6114
02:41:48,721 --> 02:41:49,650
which you can do right now.

6115
02:41:49,651 --> 02:41:50,610
And in any browser,

6116
02:41:50,611 --> 02:41:51,800
if you open up your browser,

6117
02:41:51,810 --> 02:41:53,820
pick a search string of any kind,

6118
02:41:54,020 --> 02:41:55,290
you can make an RSS feed.

6119
02:41:55,291 --> 02:41:55,650
Stop it.

6120
02:41:55,650 --> 02:41:56,483
No one's doing that.

6121
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:57,720
No one's making RSL anyways.

6122
02:41:57,721 --> 02:41:58,700
I'm just saying that you can't,

6123
02:41:58,710 --> 02:41:59,511
you can do it if you're,

6124
02:41:59,511 --> 02:42:00,900
if you're freaking out about RSS feeds,

6125
02:42:00,910 --> 02:42:03,780
you probably know can easily
cut and paste an RSS string.

6126
02:42:04,250 --> 02:42:04,510
Well,

6127
02:42:04,510 --> 02:42:05,181
when people don't know,

6128
02:42:05,181 --> 02:42:07,010
no one's food is freaking
out about RSS feeds.

6129
02:42:07,080 --> 02:42:08,130
Exactly the 1%.

6130
02:42:08,310 --> 02:42:08,701
So anyways,

6131
02:42:08,701 --> 02:42:09,534
but each one of these,

6132
02:42:09,990 --> 02:42:11,220
each one of these pages,

6133
02:42:11,270 --> 02:42:11,570
uh,

6134
02:42:11,570 --> 02:42:11,790
like,

6135
02:42:11,790 --> 02:42:13,530
like the naughty show
page and stuff like that,

6136
02:42:13,531 --> 02:42:15,270
we'll have all the individual,

6137
02:42:15,440 --> 02:42:15,630
uh,

6138
02:42:15,630 --> 02:42:17,940
shows for each person
and it's going to have,

6139
02:42:17,970 --> 02:42:20,930
each host is going to have a paypal,

6140
02:42:21,270 --> 02:42:21,920
uh,

6141
02:42:21,920 --> 02:42:22,380
uh,

6142
02:42:22,380 --> 02:42:23,730
show donation.

6143
02:42:23,760 --> 02:42:27,750
How many of your network shows or you
actually in every single one and every one

6144
02:42:27,751 --> 02:42:27,901
of them.

6145
02:42:27,901 --> 02:42:29,370
So that's another thing that's,

6146
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:30,570
that's I produced them all.

6147
02:42:30,820 --> 02:42:32,350
The only ones I don't do is when like,

6148
02:42:32,430 --> 02:42:32,851
like I say,

6149
02:42:32,851 --> 02:42:35,580
Brian Count or somebody is
doing one in their hotel room.

6150
02:42:35,610 --> 02:42:38,040
Doesn't that drive you crazy to be
in all those different podcasts?

6151
02:42:38,041 --> 02:42:38,371
I mean,

6152
02:42:38,371 --> 02:42:40,070
your brain must be
scattered now because it's,

6153
02:42:40,270 --> 02:42:41,790
it's quality control for everything.

6154
02:42:41,970 --> 02:42:42,780
I mean there's like,

6155
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:43,170
there's like,

6156
02:42:43,170 --> 02:42:45,090
there's like shows like
I love Esther to death,

6157
02:42:45,091 --> 02:42:45,871
but you know,

6158
02:42:45,871 --> 02:42:46,350
if,

6159
02:42:46,350 --> 02:42:46,890
uh,

6160
02:42:46,890 --> 02:42:47,730
if I didn't,

6161
02:42:48,030 --> 02:42:49,830
if I wasn't there and just put it up,

6162
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:54,300
I would be mad at myself for
fucking letting you listen to it.

6163
02:42:54,440 --> 02:42:54,740
And,

6164
02:42:54,740 --> 02:42:55,800
and vice versa.

6165
02:42:55,801 --> 02:42:56,311
Sometimes,

6166
02:42:56,311 --> 02:42:56,611
you know,

6167
02:42:56,611 --> 02:42:56,941
there's,

6168
02:42:56,941 --> 02:42:57,300
there's,

6169
02:42:57,300 --> 02:43:00,720
there's a quality that all
these people get where like,

6170
02:43:00,721 --> 02:43:00,931
you know,

6171
02:43:00,931 --> 02:43:01,291
when,

6172
02:43:01,291 --> 02:43:02,310
when Ari was on,

6173
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:03,030
uh,

6174
02:43:03,030 --> 02:43:03,781
on death squad,

6175
02:43:03,781 --> 02:43:04,001
he,

6176
02:43:04,001 --> 02:43:07,860
you sent me one file once and it
was like one person was really loud,

6177
02:43:07,861 --> 02:43:08,790
one person was super,

6178
02:43:08,791 --> 02:43:09,451
super quiet.

6179
02:43:09,451 --> 02:43:10,284
You can hear it.

6180
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:12,040
And I know Ari was angry

6181
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:14,830
at me for not wanting to put that
up exactly what you were saying.

6182
02:43:14,831 --> 02:43:16,630
We're not putting it up before
you let me listen to it.

6183
02:43:17,050 --> 02:43:17,820
That's all it was.

6184
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:18,101
It was like,

6185
02:43:18,101 --> 02:43:18,770
let me hear it.

6186
02:43:18,770 --> 02:43:19,603
I'll make my decision.

6187
02:43:19,630 --> 02:43:20,230
Right.

6188
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:21,160
But it kept saying no,

6189
02:43:21,161 --> 02:43:23,350
and I told him I couldn't
put it up because honestly,

6190
02:43:23,351 --> 02:43:25,780
I sat there for two
hours trying to fix it,

6191
02:43:25,781 --> 02:43:28,660
to make it so it would be
acceptable and it wasn't.

6192
02:43:28,730 --> 02:43:31,370
And that totally makes sense because
a lot of people don't know that,

6193
02:43:31,371 --> 02:43:31,540
that,

6194
02:43:31,540 --> 02:43:31,751
yeah,

6195
02:43:31,751 --> 02:43:33,820
I'm on these pockets cause
I'm fucking producing them.

6196
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:34,480
I told,

6197
02:43:34,480 --> 02:43:35,171
I told uh,

6198
02:43:35,171 --> 02:43:38,590
um column cause after you told him
I like his stuff was the same way.

6199
02:43:38,591 --> 02:43:39,250
It wasn't coming through.

6200
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:39,611
I was like,

6201
02:43:39,611 --> 02:43:41,530
do you know you have to get
microphones in courts without right?

6202
02:43:41,531 --> 02:43:41,771
And he goes,

6203
02:43:41,771 --> 02:43:41,921
no,

6204
02:43:41,921 --> 02:43:42,340
I didn't know that.

6205
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:42,581
I was like,

6206
02:43:42,581 --> 02:43:42,671
yeah,

6207
02:43:42,671 --> 02:43:43,830
you got to get my coupons in chords.

6208
02:43:43,900 --> 02:43:45,030
So he got told them where to get it.

6209
02:43:45,060 --> 02:43:45,210
Yeah.

6210
02:43:45,210 --> 02:43:46,450
I like those way better from now on.

6211
02:43:46,510 --> 02:43:47,130
Yeah.

6212
02:43:47,130 --> 02:43:52,130
The only problem that I have is that we
use the name death squad for all of us.

6213
02:43:53,110 --> 02:43:56,770
And if you got a network that's death
squad and then anyone who is on there

6214
02:43:56,771 --> 02:44:01,771
because it's one of those people and not
necessarily the real death squad way to

6215
02:44:02,261 --> 02:44:07,261
do it is to do Joey's podcasts podcast,

6216
02:44:07,300 --> 02:44:08,410
to put it on a page somewhere.

6217
02:44:09,550 --> 02:44:10,540
We could put that if you,

6218
02:44:10,541 --> 02:44:10,921
if you,

6219
02:44:10,921 --> 02:44:12,760
if Brian one too offensive right now,

6220
02:44:12,970 --> 02:44:14,830
no one's saying anything bad
because that makes no sense.

6221
02:44:16,410 --> 02:44:16,930
No,

6222
02:44:16,930 --> 02:44:17,860
it makes a lot of sense.

6223
02:44:17,861 --> 02:44:18,670
What I'm saying?

6224
02:44:18,670 --> 02:44:19,261
I do a display.

6225
02:44:19,261 --> 02:44:20,810
It's a 100% clear on what you're doing,

6226
02:44:20,811 --> 02:44:23,080
like it's being attacked and people on,

6227
02:44:23,170 --> 02:44:24,850
and I think you're doing
the same thing because,

6228
02:44:24,851 --> 02:44:26,620
because what it is is
I'm doing the same thing.

6229
02:44:26,620 --> 02:44:26,921
What?

6230
02:44:26,921 --> 02:44:28,090
Because what I'm doing is you're,

6231
02:44:28,150 --> 02:44:31,860
you're pretty much saying the real
reason to do a podcast network like,

6232
02:44:31,861 --> 02:44:33,490
like I'm not doing a real reason,

6233
02:44:33,491 --> 02:44:36,760
a way to do it just because
I'm using the words I'm saying.

6234
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:39,630
The right way to call it desk won.

6235
02:44:39,790 --> 02:44:41,830
It should not just be
the shows that you're in.

6236
02:44:42,070 --> 02:44:43,060
It should be all of us.

6237
02:44:43,180 --> 02:44:44,650
It desk squad is a bunch of friends,

6238
02:44:44,651 --> 02:44:45,130
right?

6239
02:44:45,130 --> 02:44:46,240
All these people that we have,

6240
02:44:46,250 --> 02:44:47,200
I'm doing all these shows.

6241
02:44:47,201 --> 02:44:48,100
I've been on the road with you,

6242
02:44:48,101 --> 02:44:48,371
Sam.

6243
02:44:48,371 --> 02:44:49,540
Aaa has been on the road with you.

6244
02:44:49,541 --> 02:44:50,374
Right?

6245
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:51,610
Stop it.

6246
02:44:51,610 --> 02:44:53,700
You're not killing people that have
been on the road with Pamela loss.

6247
02:44:53,720 --> 02:44:54,553
Not what you're doing.

6248
02:44:54,570 --> 02:44:54,810
You're,

6249
02:44:54,810 --> 02:44:55,840
you've got a bunch of pillows.

6250
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:57,970
Even know who these
people are talking about.

6251
02:44:57,971 --> 02:44:58,960
The host of the show up right in a while.

6252
02:44:58,970 --> 02:45:00,130
She used to take some else on the right,

6253
02:45:00,131 --> 02:45:00,420
right.

6254
02:45:00,420 --> 02:45:02,590
Some of them bring you want to
consider and being in the death squad,

6255
02:45:02,650 --> 02:45:03,021
Brian?

6256
02:45:03,021 --> 02:45:03,760
Some of them,

6257
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:04,301
some of them,

6258
02:45:04,301 --> 02:45:05,051
some of them not.

6259
02:45:05,051 --> 02:45:05,884
You know,

6260
02:45:06,460 --> 02:45:07,960
come on all that shit.

6261
02:45:08,170 --> 02:45:09,130
There's a bunch of them.

6262
02:45:09,131 --> 02:45:09,851
I don't want to name names.

6263
02:45:09,851 --> 02:45:11,320
I don't want to criticize anybody I know,

6264
02:45:11,321 --> 02:45:12,760
but every person is a guest on the show.

6265
02:45:12,761 --> 02:45:14,690
I wouldn't consider it
beyond a desk squad would you

6266
02:45:16,210 --> 02:45:18,610
like if you have a person
that's on your show as a guest,

6267
02:45:18,790 --> 02:45:19,481
there's a big difference.

6268
02:45:19,481 --> 02:45:21,910
She didn't happen to someone on its guest
is how it's someone who you're doing a

6269
02:45:21,911 --> 02:45:24,490
show with them and then you're calling
it desk squat and you're putting it on a

6270
02:45:24,491 --> 02:45:25,324
network.

6271
02:45:25,360 --> 02:45:29,380
You essentially have taken over that
name and use it for your own stuff.

6272
02:45:29,650 --> 02:45:30,600
It's just squad.

6273
02:45:31,060 --> 02:45:31,900
I'm not desk squad.

6274
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:33,520
You're on everyone that does squad.

6275
02:45:33,580 --> 02:45:36,700
All of us are a desk while you were on
every one of them because I produce every

6276
02:45:36,701 --> 02:45:37,330
single show on that.

6277
02:45:37,330 --> 02:45:37,631
That's why.

6278
02:45:37,631 --> 02:45:38,440
Yes,

6279
02:45:38,440 --> 02:45:43,440
but do you not see that that is like
that is like you are sort of 90% of the

6280
02:45:43,901 --> 02:45:46,960
shows like I probably talk
about 10% of the time.

6281
02:45:48,070 --> 02:45:48,610
It's usually,

6282
02:45:48,610 --> 02:45:50,590
it's more of a same thing.

6283
02:45:50,591 --> 02:45:51,850
If he listened to Howard Stern,

6284
02:45:51,851 --> 02:45:54,370
if he listened to any of the shows that
have producers like Iraq or anything

6285
02:45:54,371 --> 02:45:54,820
like that,

6286
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:55,511
that's a normal thing,

6287
02:45:55,511 --> 02:45:55,900
Joe.

6288
02:45:55,900 --> 02:45:56,141
Dude,

6289
02:45:56,141 --> 02:45:57,820
I'm not saying there's anything
wrong with what you're doing.

6290
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:58,990
I'm not saying that at all.

6291
02:45:59,020 --> 02:46:00,010
I'm not criticizing you.

6292
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:04,420
I'm just saying that to call it to
death squad is kind of weird because the

6293
02:46:04,421 --> 02:46:04,721
desk,

6294
02:46:04,721 --> 02:46:05,411
what it's supposed to be,

6295
02:46:05,411 --> 02:46:05,951
all of us,

6296
02:46:05,951 --> 02:46:09,010
and most of the people that are in
the dusk squad aren't on the desk.

6297
02:46:09,020 --> 02:46:09,321
Squad.

6298
02:46:09,321 --> 02:46:09,561
Dot.

6299
02:46:09,561 --> 02:46:10,670
T so

6300
02:46:10,700 --> 02:46:13,950
if one of you other guys did
something with a desktop game,

6301
02:46:14,540 --> 02:46:15,320
then go for it.

6302
02:46:15,320 --> 02:46:16,131
I was the first one.

6303
02:46:16,131 --> 02:46:16,371
I was like,

6304
02:46:16,371 --> 02:46:16,611
Hey,

6305
02:46:16,611 --> 02:46:19,250
I'm just going to make a collection
of shows and call it death squad cars.

6306
02:46:19,251 --> 02:46:20,240
Obese said at one time,

6307
02:46:20,241 --> 02:46:20,960
and it was funny.

6308
02:46:20,960 --> 02:46:21,170
Yeah,

6309
02:46:21,170 --> 02:46:23,000
but it's not the that you don't do,

6310
02:46:23,001 --> 02:46:23,450
you know?

6311
02:46:23,450 --> 02:46:25,700
Well you be death squads
a little different to you,

6312
02:46:25,730 --> 02:46:28,470
like you feel it's like the four
people that was in the room.

6313
02:46:28,471 --> 02:46:29,304
I do not.

6314
02:46:29,340 --> 02:46:30,410
I feel it's family.

6315
02:46:30,411 --> 02:46:33,650
It's all the people that were family and
I think it's a lot of people that you

6316
02:46:33,651 --> 02:46:34,120
podcasts,

6317
02:46:34,120 --> 02:46:34,361
whether you,

6318
02:46:34,361 --> 02:46:35,060
they asked me,

6319
02:46:35,060 --> 02:46:35,893
we're going to do this.

6320
02:46:35,990 --> 02:46:37,970
Hold on girls.

6321
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:38,361
Nice.

6322
02:46:38,361 --> 02:46:39,081
And Brian Keeley,

6323
02:46:39,081 --> 02:46:39,920
she's a very nice girl.

6324
02:46:40,130 --> 02:46:41,540
Dan Dumas and very nice girl.

6325
02:46:41,541 --> 02:46:42,500
Those people aren't your family.

6326
02:46:43,050 --> 02:46:43,720
Uh,

6327
02:46:43,720 --> 02:46:44,880
we were shown up.

6328
02:46:44,900 --> 02:46:46,970
They're friends of mine that
can meet their friends with you.

6329
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:50,293
She's a nice girl.

6330
02:46:50,390 --> 02:46:52,550
She's not my federal
on this podcast I have,

6331
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:53,593
what does the question,

6332
02:46:53,600 --> 02:46:53,871
Brian,

6333
02:46:53,871 --> 02:46:55,580
just to put a lot of people
we've had on this podcast,

6334
02:46:55,730 --> 02:46:58,550
but you're acting like a
tree house and you're like,

6335
02:46:58,551 --> 02:47:00,110
you're not allowed in this tree house.

6336
02:47:00,140 --> 02:47:00,741
That's not what I'm saying.

6337
02:47:00,741 --> 02:47:02,090
I'm saying you're calling it desk.

6338
02:47:02,091 --> 02:47:02,241
Why?

6339
02:47:02,241 --> 02:47:04,630
When death squad is us
desk was us as friends,

6340
02:47:04,640 --> 02:47:05,360
you know,

6341
02:47:05,360 --> 02:47:07,100
tagging all the people that
were hanging out together.

6342
02:47:07,101 --> 02:47:07,934
And that group,

6343
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:08,420
there was no,

6344
02:47:08,420 --> 02:47:09,340
there was not the whole desk.

6345
02:47:11,720 --> 02:47:12,830
It'll be called us desk squad.

6346
02:47:13,250 --> 02:47:16,700
So you're saying Joe d
is this because this is,

6347
02:47:16,710 --> 02:47:17,421
Joey does not.

6348
02:47:17,421 --> 02:47:18,820
One of my best friends is Joey Diaz.

6349
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:22,280
Not Constantly on the road with us when
we w is Joey d is not the one who uses

6350
02:47:22,281 --> 02:47:23,150
it more than anybody.

6351
02:47:23,270 --> 02:47:24,770
He was the one who
actually started calling.

6352
02:47:24,771 --> 02:47:25,610
Everybody does squad.

6353
02:47:25,610 --> 02:47:26,720
He's the one who ran with it.

6354
02:47:27,140 --> 02:47:28,130
He thought it was hilarious.

6355
02:47:28,131 --> 02:47:30,890
There's obviously some heat here then
because you were really having a problem

6356
02:47:30,891 --> 02:47:31,660
with me using the name.

6357
02:47:31,660 --> 02:47:32,640
Not even a problem at all.

6358
02:47:33,270 --> 02:47:38,270
All had a radio station at night and
we were all talking about and I just

6359
02:47:38,391 --> 02:47:40,220
happened to start calling
something desk squad.

6360
02:47:40,221 --> 02:47:41,120
It doesn't mean that I'm like,

6361
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:41,391
no,

6362
02:47:41,391 --> 02:47:44,060
he was talking about me and it's all
me and I'm deaf squad and that's what I

6363
02:47:44,061 --> 02:47:44,450
mean.

6364
02:47:44,450 --> 02:47:47,960
I'm just saying that I used a term that
we all use and I bought a domain and

6365
02:47:47,961 --> 02:47:49,670
started doing a podcast for you.

6366
02:47:49,671 --> 02:47:53,810
Started doing a podcast and started
calling the show's death squad car gas

6367
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:54,250
networks.

6368
02:47:54,250 --> 02:47:55,910
So you have essentially hijack the name,

6369
02:47:56,850 --> 02:47:57,390
uh,

6370
02:47:57,390 --> 02:47:59,080
taking the name for your own lightweight,

6371
02:47:59,460 --> 02:48:01,580
that name desk while you're
taking it for your own network.

6372
02:48:01,730 --> 02:48:02,563
The net with a name.

6373
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:05,210
Why not saying you aren't?

6374
02:48:05,211 --> 02:48:06,980
I'm just saying if it really was desk won,

6375
02:48:07,100 --> 02:48:08,720
you would have so sorry on that.

6376
02:48:08,930 --> 02:48:13,310
I have big links to all the people
that you're not profiting from as well.

6377
02:48:13,340 --> 02:48:13,641
If I,

6378
02:48:13,641 --> 02:48:17,300
if I created a podcast network
and called it powerful,

6379
02:48:17,400 --> 02:48:20,120
are you saying that that wasn't what
would then be allowed to do that?

6380
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:23,130
It's a big difference between a whole
group of people that call themselves death

6381
02:48:23,131 --> 02:48:23,690
squad.

6382
02:48:23,690 --> 02:48:26,030
We've been calling ourselves death
squad for like almost a decade,

6383
02:48:26,360 --> 02:48:29,470
and then all of a sudden a podcast comes
along and you call this podcast that

6384
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:33,220
domain 2007 does mean Brian,

6385
02:48:33,230 --> 02:48:33,810
what does that mean?

6386
02:48:33,810 --> 02:48:34,940
Just because you bought the domain,

6387
02:48:34,941 --> 02:48:37,130
didn't we call ourselves that
before you bought the domain?

6388
02:48:37,160 --> 02:48:37,640
Yeah.

6389
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:39,140
So we call ourselves a lot of things,

6390
02:48:39,141 --> 02:48:39,480
but that,

6391
02:48:39,480 --> 02:48:40,850
does that mean I'm not allowed to say,

6392
02:48:40,851 --> 02:48:41,061
hey,

6393
02:48:41,061 --> 02:48:43,010
I might use that as a name for a podcast,

6394
02:48:43,011 --> 02:48:44,330
that workout all you guys,

6395
02:48:44,360 --> 02:48:47,120
I can't even believe that you
don't see another side of this.

6396
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:49,610
I can't believe I see what you're saying,

6397
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:53,180
but it's kind of funny that I've been
doing it since 2007 and now you're just

6398
02:48:53,181 --> 02:48:58,181
making it so [inaudible] is that
it just be all of us included,

6399
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:01,353
the guys,

6400
02:49:01,370 --> 02:49:06,320
the guys that aren't in a podcast
network don't profit from it,

6401
02:49:06,321 --> 02:49:07,890
and he's not saying you've
done something specific.

6402
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:08,280
Hold on.

6403
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:08,911
Listen for a second.

6404
02:49:08,911 --> 02:49:09,631
Is that something you'd done?

6405
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,950
Anything specifically wrong?

6406
02:49:10,980 --> 02:49:12,210
I know you knew I was gonna say that.

6407
02:49:12,660 --> 02:49:13,510
I was going to say that

6408
02:49:16,150 --> 02:49:16,983
Brian.

6409
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:20,400
I know he's not saying you'd
done anything specifically wrong.

6410
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:21,413
He's saying,

6411
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:26,370
wouldn't it be nice to have built a
page or in the future to build a page to

6412
02:49:26,371 --> 02:49:27,204
include the people

6413
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:30,030
in that group to begin with?

6414
02:49:30,060 --> 02:49:30,893
It should.

6415
02:49:32,870 --> 02:49:34,050
It should be all of us.

6416
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:35,100
It should be Joey Diaz.

6417
02:49:35,130 --> 02:49:35,941
It should be Duncan.

6418
02:49:35,941 --> 02:49:37,560
It should be people that have
never been in the pocket.

6419
02:49:37,570 --> 02:49:38,341
There we go right there.

6420
02:49:38,341 --> 02:49:38,940
Because,

6421
02:49:38,940 --> 02:49:41,160
because that who does this?

6422
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:43,590
Who does that gets to choose to design it?

6423
02:49:43,591 --> 02:49:45,340
Because like you said some you might,

6424
02:49:46,050 --> 02:49:46,883
how about I'll choose.

6425
02:49:46,980 --> 02:49:47,380
Yeah,

6426
02:49:47,380 --> 02:49:48,080
but why?

6427
02:49:48,080 --> 02:49:48,500
Why?

6428
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:50,190
Why shouldn't death squad?

6429
02:49:50,580 --> 02:49:51,413
I'll tell you this

6430
02:49:53,490 --> 02:49:54,810
because I'm going to treat it fairly.

6431
02:49:54,910 --> 02:49:55,350
How much?

6432
02:49:55,350 --> 02:49:56,183
Cause I'm gonna

6433
02:49:57,470 --> 02:49:58,490
tell me how I'm not.

6434
02:49:58,530 --> 02:50:01,710
Because there's somebody that you might
want on there that I might not want on

6435
02:50:01,711 --> 02:50:04,800
there and there might be something on
you don't think Dunkin deserves to be in

6436
02:50:04,801 --> 02:50:06,360
because you and him
and having an argument,

6437
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:08,670
you don't think the Dunkin
deserves to be part of desk squad.

6438
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:10,440
He's told me before.

6439
02:50:10,441 --> 02:50:11,020
But you were,

6440
02:50:11,020 --> 02:50:15,480
there were arguments at the bar when
you were the argument cames from Dunkin

6441
02:50:15,481 --> 02:50:19,290
getting upset at Brian when we were in
Atlanta was saying the Brian doesn't pay

6442
02:50:19,291 --> 02:50:22,740
the comedians when he charges money for
the shows at the ice house and then it

6443
02:50:22,741 --> 02:50:23,230
should,

6444
02:50:23,230 --> 02:50:24,063
you should put it up.

6445
02:50:24,090 --> 02:50:24,510
But yeah,

6446
02:50:24,510 --> 02:50:25,020
I do.

6447
02:50:25,020 --> 02:50:25,980
And he just didn't know.

6448
02:50:25,981 --> 02:50:27,300
You only paid the MCS.

6449
02:50:27,390 --> 02:50:28,160
That's not true.

6450
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:28,993
Okay.

6451
02:50:29,310 --> 02:50:29,730
Okay.

6452
02:50:29,730 --> 02:50:30,480
I can draw it.

6453
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:32,700
You should pay now or you're going to
throw me under the bus too because you

6454
02:50:32,701 --> 02:50:33,370
have no idea anyway.

6455
02:50:33,370 --> 02:50:33,640
Right.

6456
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:35,670
If you started paying people recently,

6457
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:36,570
this is a different thing.

6458
02:50:37,050 --> 02:50:37,890
Don't turn off Bro.

6459
02:50:37,891 --> 02:50:41,760
You can't recapture this again because
when you don't raise your voice and don't

6460
02:50:41,761 --> 02:50:42,594
get crazy,

6461
02:50:44,170 --> 02:50:44,671
first of all,

6462
02:50:44,671 --> 02:50:47,160
let me explain that John can
shouldn't have done what he did.

6463
02:50:48,470 --> 02:50:50,090
He threw me under a bus.

6464
02:50:50,470 --> 02:50:51,450
Brian me drunk.

6465
02:50:51,451 --> 02:50:53,790
Even though I had a beer and
a red bull is not an insult.

6466
02:50:53,791 --> 02:50:54,900
So he's also just fucking,

6467
02:50:54,901 --> 02:50:55,681
he wasn't correct.

6468
02:50:55,681 --> 02:50:56,580
He was trying to diminish,

6469
02:50:56,840 --> 02:50:58,450
he was trying to attack me on,

6470
02:50:58,490 --> 02:50:59,323
on.

6471
02:50:59,510 --> 02:51:00,001
All right.

6472
02:51:00,001 --> 02:51:01,920
So that's a hard thing was discussed.

6473
02:51:01,960 --> 02:51:02,371
The problem,

6474
02:51:02,371 --> 02:51:05,370
what I happened and what he was getting
at is we were talking about southwest by

6475
02:51:05,371 --> 02:51:06,091
southwest,

6476
02:51:06,091 --> 02:51:07,160
right south by southwest.

6477
02:51:07,380 --> 02:51:10,770
He does this video that where it says
that southwest by southwest makes a

6478
02:51:10,771 --> 02:51:11,521
shitload of money,

6479
02:51:11,521 --> 02:51:12,241
whatever it's called.

6480
02:51:12,241 --> 02:51:16,020
And they don't pay people to come out
there cause he was offered to come out

6481
02:51:16,021 --> 02:51:17,040
there and he didn't get paid.

6482
02:51:17,430 --> 02:51:22,430
And so what I had brought up is that I
had been hearing that really it's all

6483
02:51:23,401 --> 02:51:25,440
about the venues like
southwest by southwest.

6484
02:51:25,441 --> 02:51:26,400
It's like a blanket name,

6485
02:51:26,401 --> 02:51:27,450
kind of like a death squad.

6486
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:31,210
And it's into each of the venues that,

6487
02:51:31,270 --> 02:51:31,581
that,

6488
02:51:31,581 --> 02:51:34,110
that if they want you to
come out and play their bar,

6489
02:51:34,250 --> 02:51:35,340
that they might pay you,

6490
02:51:35,450 --> 02:51:35,820
you know?

6491
02:51:35,820 --> 02:51:39,780
But southwest doesn't do anything
to promote it as a big party,

6492
02:51:39,930 --> 02:51:40,171
you know,

6493
02:51:40,171 --> 02:51:40,550
like they,

6494
02:51:40,550 --> 02:51:43,410
they do advertising and
promotions and stuff like that.

6495
02:51:43,411 --> 02:51:46,350
And then when I'm talking to Duncan
made a video saying that they don't pay

6496
02:51:46,351 --> 02:51:47,820
anyone in and they steal from comics.

6497
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,360
So what happened is I was talking to,

6498
02:51:49,361 --> 02:51:50,101
and I was explaining like,

6499
02:51:50,101 --> 02:51:50,251
Hey,

6500
02:51:50,251 --> 02:51:51,150
I heard this and he goes,

6501
02:51:51,151 --> 02:51:51,984
you're drunk.

6502
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:52,531
And I'm like,

6503
02:51:52,531 --> 02:51:52,891
Whoa,

6504
02:51:52,891 --> 02:51:53,131
okay,

6505
02:51:53,131 --> 02:51:57,600
this is not your a really
paraphrasing obviously obviously so,

6506
02:51:57,690 --> 02:51:58,320
so,

6507
02:51:58,320 --> 02:51:58,531
uh,

6508
02:51:58,531 --> 02:52:00,370
what then it turned into it that he's,

6509
02:52:00,430 --> 02:52:03,000
he said on a podcast
you steal from comics.

6510
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:03,661
And I was like,

6511
02:52:03,661 --> 02:52:05,010
what the fuck are you talking about?

6512
02:52:05,190 --> 02:52:06,190
Cause you still from comedy,

6513
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:06,871
you don't pay your comics.

6514
02:52:06,871 --> 02:52:07,300
And I'm like,

6515
02:52:07,300 --> 02:52:07,600
well,

6516
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:08,410
Dunkin wine,

6517
02:52:08,410 --> 02:52:09,040
why do you,

6518
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:10,330
why do you think I don't pay my comics?

6519
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:11,590
I do pay,

6520
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:12,060
uh,

6521
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:12,360
the,

6522
02:52:12,360 --> 02:52:14,200
the MC or the host usually,

6523
02:52:14,201 --> 02:52:19,201
which is like Tony Hinchcliffe or will
I give them 40 to 60 bucks and I then I

6524
02:52:19,661 --> 02:52:23,800
pay usually if there's any people like
little Esther or anyone that I know that

6525
02:52:23,801 --> 02:52:24,581
it's like fucking,

6526
02:52:24,581 --> 02:52:25,180
you know,

6527
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:27,010
like they don't even have
gas money to get there.

6528
02:52:27,130 --> 02:52:28,990
I'll throw him 20 to 40 bucks sometimes.

6529
02:52:29,110 --> 02:52:30,910
And like as an example
of this last one I gave,

6530
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:31,790
you know,

6531
02:52:31,790 --> 02:52:33,880
little Esther money I
gave Mark Ellis some cash.

6532
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:34,511
I and I,

6533
02:52:34,511 --> 02:52:34,751
you know,

6534
02:52:34,751 --> 02:52:35,584
I spread it out.

6535
02:52:36,220 --> 02:52:36,551
I'll tell you,

6536
02:52:36,551 --> 02:52:37,990
those people have been grow more.

6537
02:52:38,020 --> 02:52:39,190
You've got to show that cash for people.

6538
02:52:39,270 --> 02:52:39,511
All right.

6539
02:52:39,511 --> 02:52:40,344
What do people,

6540
02:52:40,630 --> 02:52:41,570
I'm driving out there,

6541
02:52:41,571 --> 02:52:42,520
there's a cover charge home.

6542
02:52:42,520 --> 02:52:43,180
I'm not going to put it.

6543
02:52:43,180 --> 02:52:43,361
All right.

6544
02:52:43,361 --> 02:52:44,194
Well here's an example.

6545
02:52:45,030 --> 02:52:46,000
You don't want to say names.

6546
02:52:46,680 --> 02:52:47,490
People are pissed.

6547
02:52:47,490 --> 02:52:47,741
All right,

6548
02:52:47,741 --> 02:52:48,190
well here's,

6549
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:48,481
here's a,

6550
02:52:48,481 --> 02:52:48,790
here's what,

6551
02:52:48,790 --> 02:52:49,660
a couple of reasons why.

6552
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:50,080
One,

6553
02:52:50,080 --> 02:52:51,640
because I don't get paid
till the following week.

6554
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:55,090
So anything I pay for that
night is I have to go to an ATM,

6555
02:52:55,091 --> 02:52:57,040
I have to take out money
and have to fucking go,

6556
02:52:57,041 --> 02:52:57,400
all right,

6557
02:52:57,400 --> 02:52:59,770
how much money did I make this sell out?

6558
02:53:00,460 --> 02:53:02,140
Then the following week usually,

6559
02:53:02,370 --> 02:53:03,040
oh,

6560
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:03,670
and so then,

6561
02:53:03,670 --> 02:53:06,070
so then I have to figure out how
much money did I kind of make?

6562
02:53:06,071 --> 02:53:07,170
Did it sell out somewhere there?

6563
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:07,541
The door,

6564
02:53:07,541 --> 02:53:11,470
look how much I could do that if I wasn't
doing a live podcast at the same time.

6565
02:53:11,980 --> 02:53:12,813
But anyways,

6566
02:53:12,930 --> 02:53:13,670
uh,

6567
02:53:13,670 --> 02:53:14,270
uh,

6568
02:53:14,270 --> 02:53:15,850
and then I get tax and all of that.

6569
02:53:15,851 --> 02:53:17,320
So everything I make there,

6570
02:53:17,380 --> 02:53:18,220
which is not even the,

6571
02:53:18,240 --> 02:53:18,401
the,

6572
02:53:18,401 --> 02:53:18,551
the,

6573
02:53:18,551 --> 02:53:19,181
the door,

6574
02:53:19,181 --> 02:53:20,020
I don't get the full door.

6575
02:53:20,020 --> 02:53:21,820
I get like 60% of the door
or something like that.

6576
02:53:22,090 --> 02:53:23,930
Then I get taxed on it so that,

6577
02:53:23,931 --> 02:53:25,030
that pretty much cuts in half.

6578
02:53:25,180 --> 02:53:25,810
So what I'm,

6579
02:53:25,810 --> 02:53:30,670
what my average is usually is it's
about $200 to $300 I make on a show.

6580
02:53:31,240 --> 02:53:33,820
I usually spend about a hundred dollars,

6581
02:53:33,990 --> 02:53:34,360
uh,

6582
02:53:34,360 --> 02:53:37,270
giving it to the
miscellaneous comics to $150,

6583
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:39,580
and the other hundred $50 to me is like,

6584
02:53:39,640 --> 02:53:39,911
okay,

6585
02:53:39,911 --> 02:53:44,911
now I could either not do the show
or make $150 for booking a show,

6586
02:53:45,881 --> 02:53:49,100
advertising his show and producing
the two bucks a ticket times.

6587
02:53:49,220 --> 02:53:51,910
And it's usually 15 when Joe
does it and 10 when I do it.

6588
02:53:52,150 --> 02:53:55,500
But I give out so many free
tickets and it's usually not one,

6589
02:53:55,740 --> 02:53:56,110
not one.

6590
02:53:56,110 --> 02:53:56,441
Joe Goes,

6591
02:53:56,441 --> 02:53:58,050
where do I give it out
when Joe does it too?

6592
02:53:58,810 --> 02:53:59,620
You don't have to.

6593
02:53:59,620 --> 02:54:00,520
I don't have to usually,

6594
02:54:00,710 --> 02:54:01,543
but usually,

6595
02:54:02,470 --> 02:54:03,191
but usually,

6596
02:54:03,191 --> 02:54:03,580
yeah,

6597
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:05,170
but usually it's also give it away.

6598
02:54:05,170 --> 02:54:06,003
Free tickets.

6599
02:54:06,690 --> 02:54:07,690
Those are the common disorders.

6600
02:54:07,720 --> 02:54:08,320
I like the,

6601
02:54:08,320 --> 02:54:09,640
they split the main room,

6602
02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:10,691
just the one show,

6603
02:54:10,691 --> 02:54:11,524
but it's nice.

6604
02:54:11,680 --> 02:54:12,281
The main room,

6605
02:54:12,281 --> 02:54:14,500
half goes to the comedy store
and half goes to the community.

6606
02:54:15,190 --> 02:54:16,210
Let me say something.

6607
02:54:16,390 --> 02:54:17,740
Here's how you avoid all this.

6608
02:54:17,930 --> 02:54:19,080
Don't actually do this.

6609
02:54:19,720 --> 02:54:20,590
That's what I want to do.

6610
02:54:21,060 --> 02:54:22,570
This is how you avoid all this forever.

6611
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:25,900
Be infallibly generous,

6612
02:54:26,590 --> 02:54:31,180
be generous to the point where they
can't infallibly do it to the point where

6613
02:54:31,181 --> 02:54:32,200
they can't argue against it.

6614
02:54:32,240 --> 02:54:34,720
The be generous to the point
where you're not saying,

6615
02:54:34,930 --> 02:54:35,321
you know,

6616
02:54:35,321 --> 02:54:35,590
I,

6617
02:54:35,590 --> 02:54:39,970
I'm gonna make 150 bucks because I feel
like I deserve it because what I do want

6618
02:54:39,971 --> 02:54:40,290
to do it,

6619
02:54:40,290 --> 02:54:40,870
you're right.

6620
02:54:40,870 --> 02:54:42,760
You know what that makes me
want to do not do it at all.

6621
02:54:42,761 --> 02:54:44,530
I don't give a fuck cause that to me,

6622
02:54:44,531 --> 02:54:45,360
very,

6623
02:54:45,360 --> 02:54:46,690
very defensive stance.

6624
02:54:46,800 --> 02:54:48,070
And especially when you're talking to me,

6625
02:54:48,520 --> 02:54:51,790
and then the reason that people are going
to the show is because I'm headlining

6626
02:54:51,791 --> 02:54:52,990
and I'm promoting it on my Twitter.

6627
02:54:53,050 --> 02:54:55,690
Obviously not a bad thing,

6628
02:54:55,691 --> 02:54:56,380
man.

6629
02:54:56,380 --> 02:54:57,400
You should make some money.

6630
02:54:57,430 --> 02:54:58,250
You should make,

6631
02:54:58,250 --> 02:54:58,600
you know what?

6632
02:54:58,600 --> 02:54:58,900
I don't,

6633
02:54:58,900 --> 02:54:59,740
I don't do it for money.

6634
02:54:59,741 --> 02:55:01,060
I don't want anything
to do with the money.

6635
02:55:01,061 --> 02:55:03,620
But I also don't want to do anything
like that for free because consider that

6636
02:55:03,621 --> 02:55:04,040
work because

6637
02:55:04,040 --> 02:55:04,970
then you're doing it for money.

6638
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:05,900
If you don't want to do it for free,

6639
02:55:05,910 --> 02:55:06,720
then you doing it right.

6640
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:08,270
You should not change then.

6641
02:55:08,300 --> 02:55:08,751
Okay,

6642
02:55:08,751 --> 02:55:09,021
man,

6643
02:55:09,021 --> 02:55:09,660
listen you,

6644
02:55:09,660 --> 02:55:09,940
you,

6645
02:55:09,940 --> 02:55:11,310
you're sounding like a little kid.

6646
02:55:11,330 --> 02:55:13,550
This is craziness because I'm
not being mad at you at all.

6647
02:55:13,900 --> 02:55:15,170
Tagging on podcast,

6648
02:55:15,171 --> 02:55:15,890
we can,

6649
02:55:15,890 --> 02:55:17,180
no one hears attacking you,

6650
02:55:17,181 --> 02:55:17,560
Bro.

6651
02:55:17,560 --> 02:55:18,110
You,

6652
02:55:18,110 --> 02:55:19,370
you and I are friends.

6653
02:55:19,371 --> 02:55:20,181
We're like brothers.

6654
02:55:20,181 --> 02:55:20,520
Okay.

6655
02:55:20,520 --> 02:55:21,351
Always like a brother.

6656
02:55:21,351 --> 02:55:22,131
We're all here together.

6657
02:55:22,131 --> 02:55:22,964
We're trying to talk,

6658
02:55:23,030 --> 02:55:25,910
but you were like really
triggers strung in.

6659
02:55:25,911 --> 02:55:29,600
One of the reasons is because you feel
like they're attacking you for his choice

6660
02:55:29,601 --> 02:55:30,830
and you're trying to defend this choice.

6661
02:55:31,310 --> 02:55:35,840
What I'm saying is the only reason why
they even can attack you is because there

6662
02:55:35,841 --> 02:55:39,340
is a point of view that they're expressing
that may be seven south by southwest,

6663
02:55:39,370 --> 02:55:41,270
but their version is this like,

6664
02:55:41,271 --> 02:55:41,421
well,

6665
02:55:41,421 --> 02:55:41,451
it,

6666
02:55:41,451 --> 02:55:42,171
you should want to be here.

6667
02:55:42,171 --> 02:55:43,430
It's a really fun time and you're like,

6668
02:55:43,431 --> 02:55:43,601
Yo,

6669
02:55:43,601 --> 02:55:44,331
I didn't want to be there,

6670
02:55:44,331 --> 02:55:47,810
but it would also be nice to have the
money you're collecting for the shows and

6671
02:55:47,811 --> 02:55:49,940
Austin would come to some of
us who were going to shows.

6672
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,340
I think there's good in
having those shows there.

6673
02:55:52,341 --> 02:55:53,990
I think it's good for the comedy club.

6674
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:55,070
I think it's good for that.

6675
02:55:55,071 --> 02:55:55,461
First of all,

6676
02:55:55,461 --> 02:55:58,160
the comedians should be getting
paid directly to the comedy clubs.

6677
02:55:58,161 --> 02:55:58,994
So you don't have,

6678
02:55:59,550 --> 02:56:00,680
you could easily do that.

6679
02:56:01,010 --> 02:56:01,690
We should that.

6680
02:56:01,690 --> 02:56:04,200
That's honestly to me.

6681
02:56:04,201 --> 02:56:04,521
And that's good,

6682
02:56:04,521 --> 02:56:04,880
isn't it?

6683
02:56:04,880 --> 02:56:06,540
Have them take each of their trucks to me.

6684
02:56:06,541 --> 02:56:07,170
In the past,

6685
02:56:07,170 --> 02:56:07,711
honestly,

6686
02:56:07,711 --> 02:56:08,550
it was more like,

6687
02:56:08,551 --> 02:56:09,150
you know what?

6688
02:56:09,150 --> 02:56:10,680
This isn't how it should be,

6689
02:56:10,681 --> 02:56:13,030
but right now I'm too
busy to fucking sit down,

6690
02:56:13,070 --> 02:56:14,730
renegotiate this thing that we started.

6691
02:56:14,731 --> 02:56:14,930
Okay,

6692
02:56:14,930 --> 02:56:15,721
well that's honest.

6693
02:56:15,721 --> 02:56:16,620
That's very honest of it.

6694
02:56:16,710 --> 02:56:18,390
And I never did not.

6695
02:56:18,450 --> 02:56:21,540
I've never not paid anyone on a show.

6696
02:56:21,541 --> 02:56:23,340
It meaning there was never a
show where I didn't pay anybody.

6697
02:56:24,170 --> 02:56:24,471
Brian,

6698
02:56:24,471 --> 02:56:25,850
when you get really mad at something,

6699
02:56:25,851 --> 02:56:26,870
that's because people are right,

6700
02:56:27,110 --> 02:56:28,760
and it doesn't mean that
you're a bad person.

6701
02:56:28,761 --> 02:56:30,140
It means they might have a point.

6702
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:32,500
Not all of our actions.

6703
02:56:32,501 --> 02:56:36,070
The reason why I pissed off at this or
were originally pissed off of me because

6704
02:56:36,071 --> 02:56:38,080
I first heard of that,

6705
02:56:38,370 --> 02:56:42,340
one of the first things I did was
Dunkin did this and it did it on a live

6706
02:56:42,341 --> 02:56:43,174
podcast.

6707
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:44,770
He blind side of me.

6708
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:46,750
And while if you went to death squad.

6709
02:56:46,751 --> 02:56:46,931
Dot.

6710
02:56:46,931 --> 02:56:47,500
TV.

6711
02:56:47,500 --> 02:56:50,680
There was a huge fucking linkedin I did
out of the own kindness of my heart.

6712
02:56:50,681 --> 02:56:53,110
He didn't ask me to talk to bias poster.

6713
02:56:53,410 --> 02:56:53,810
Okay,

6714
02:56:53,810 --> 02:56:54,111
hold on.

6715
02:56:54,111 --> 02:56:56,560
Do you have this argument
to bring up something else?

6716
02:56:56,561 --> 02:56:57,730
You've done a nice for a person.

6717
02:56:58,050 --> 02:56:59,230
Well then somehow,

6718
02:56:59,700 --> 02:57:01,720
so how dare you bring up this a argument.

6719
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:04,530
I might say a separate org,

6720
02:57:04,531 --> 02:57:04,991
three minutes,

6721
02:57:04,991 --> 02:57:06,760
but he's got a very good point.

6722
02:57:06,790 --> 02:57:07,181
The only thing,

6723
02:57:07,181 --> 02:57:09,700
and the reason I would say that is because
in the past I've done a lot for this

6724
02:57:09,701 --> 02:57:10,451
guy and he,

6725
02:57:10,451 --> 02:57:11,890
and instead of just like
talking to me and going,

6726
02:57:11,891 --> 02:57:12,041
hey,

6727
02:57:12,041 --> 02:57:13,060
why don't you do this or die?

6728
02:57:13,240 --> 02:57:14,980
And I could explained this
whole thing I just did to you.

6729
02:57:14,981 --> 02:57:15,371
And He'd be like,

6730
02:57:15,371 --> 02:57:15,461
oh,

6731
02:57:15,461 --> 02:57:16,250
that kind of makes sense.

6732
02:57:16,250 --> 02:57:16,791
So let's just do it.

6733
02:57:16,791 --> 02:57:17,471
I'll slow down slow.

6734
02:57:17,471 --> 02:57:18,101
We have three minutes.

6735
02:57:18,101 --> 02:57:18,661
We have to end this.

6736
02:57:18,661 --> 02:57:19,290
So

6737
02:57:19,290 --> 02:57:19,350
no,

6738
02:57:19,350 --> 02:57:19,470
no,

6739
02:57:19,470 --> 02:57:19,680
no.

6740
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:20,070
Listen,

6741
02:57:20,070 --> 02:57:21,060
we're going to end this part.

6742
02:57:21,061 --> 02:57:23,850
We're going to come back and wrap this
up because this is too ridiculous.

6743
02:57:24,030 --> 02:57:25,750
We'll have a little
part one and a part two.

6744
02:57:25,860 --> 02:57:30,570
So let's stop this portion of it and
we'll come back with a very informal five

6745
02:57:30,571 --> 02:57:31,404
minutes.

6746
02:57:31,620 --> 02:57:32,453
We'll take a little break,

6747
02:57:33,300 --> 02:57:33,931
but we need to,

6748
02:57:33,931 --> 02:57:35,850
we need to relax and calm
us down cause this is,

6749
02:57:35,860 --> 02:57:37,240
this is really getting great.

6750
02:57:38,130 --> 02:57:40,110
That'll help elect to anything.

6751
02:57:40,320 --> 02:57:41,490
So let's pause it right now.

6752
02:57:41,491 --> 02:57:43,020
Let's thanked the flashlight.
