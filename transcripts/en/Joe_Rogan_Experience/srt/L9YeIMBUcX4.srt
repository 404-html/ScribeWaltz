1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,900
The joe rogan experience within that
three o'clock I had to go home and change

2
00:00:04,901 --> 00:00:06,340
into white clothes for a year,

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,110
not allow for a year,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,280
how to dress him white now for a year.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,890
So for my call is I would just have to
wear white socks and white tee shirt

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,011
cause I was a kid.

7
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:22,120
I can't keep wearing fucking white every
damn I'm ripping shit right so that

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,650
your has to grow back.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,850
So when I walk into,

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,330
I know there's a ton of
Santeria and La Really,

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,390
I don't deal with it at all
because it's all the same thing.

12
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:32,670
Like everything else in that light.

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,360
It's a bunch of white
people and grow up in and,

14
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,610
and there's a hot black guy and they
want to really just suck this day talking

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,540
about spirits.

16
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,160
I saw a video today,

17
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,503
I saw a video,

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,680
I'm like shame on them.

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,030
It's all confused.

20
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:49,810
It's like those white chicks that suck
that Hindu Dick when they go to hot yoga,

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,580
he got big room.

22
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,070
Big Room is a pig you've got is a bunch
of white chicks with hummus flavor and

23
00:00:57,071 --> 00:00:58,700
that mouth from sucking that

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,860
he gets to me inside.

25
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:03,000
He,

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,470
you suck that fucking that.

27
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,910
That smells like hummus chips,

28
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:07,920
you know,

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,150
and that's what it is in that way,

30
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:11,830
like I've been invited to two parties.

31
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,150
First Time I went,

32
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:13,984
you know who's was in there?

33
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,240
Who fucking the dude
from that playing Edr?

34
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,093
Me.

35
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:19,730
Fuck played.

36
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:19,970
Yeah,

37
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,460
mean forest.

38
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,423
Forrest Whitaker.

39
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,440
Really?

40
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,780
The chick that won Miss America
for eating pussy from behind.

41
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,450
The lights in this area are rolling.

42
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,221
Oh,

43
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,630
Vanessa Williams.

44
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,940
It's not my Santeria.

45
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,980
I grew up in a Cuban santare.

46
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,560
You shut your fucking mouth
area because it's a shirt.

47
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,510
My QB.

48
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,710
Is it Mexican influence?

49
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,620
This is white influence.

50
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,100
Oh my God,

51
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:48,993
let's dance.

52
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,110
Look,

53
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,531
get that.

54
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,370
Look at forest.

55
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,810
It's very watered down.

56
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,450
And look at the guy from Danny Glover.

57
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,200
Forrest Whitaker dressed
up like like fucking monks.

58
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,921
That's crazy.

59
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:00,401
Don't do.

60
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:01,510
I don't pop the plate.

61
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,980
I came up hilarious.

62
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,230
I came up under the very strict,

63
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:06,250
shut your mouth.

64
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,710
Nobody needs to know
your fucking business.

65
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:08,800
What

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,633
are these two?

67
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,753
The only thing,

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,353
the role

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,661
and then I want to,

70
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:15,471
I do have a question.

71
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:15,651
You know,

72
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:16,760
you might have an answer.

73
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,040
What did you have a half of spray?

74
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,933
I had one spray.

75
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,680
Good enough.

76
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,230
Okay.

77
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,530
Alright,

78
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,363
we're in.

79
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,710
What was the other
question that you think,

80
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,580
why am I asking you this?

81
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,810
But I think you might have an answer.

82
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,393
So,

83
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,020
but I'm being totally honest.

84
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,350
I exhausted from dealing with like a,

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,240
it's not like it's a big deal,

86
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,350
but it's like the first time you,

87
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,420
whether you can admit
major things in your life.

88
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:41,630
Like,

89
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,590
oh I have a drinking problem,

90
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,970
but would be stupid little things.

91
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:44,300
Yeah,

92
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,230
mine is eating.

93
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:45,780
I'm like,

94
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,210
I'm exhausted from doing it the wrong
way and everything comes back to me for

95
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,044
self control.

96
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,940
So when people want to
tell me about a diet,

97
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,331
I don't,

98
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,200
it's not portions.

99
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
I know what portions are.

100
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,050
I just,

101
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,110
I want to eat more.

102
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,820
So it's all down to how do
I fucking get self control?

103
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,780
I have zero.

104
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,171
I mean,

105
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:03,820
if I'm not going to call
it zero self control,

106
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,680
then I don't know what the
hell I'm going to call it.

107
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,910
But as you are hard for me,

108
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,790
you're not,

109
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,770
you're hard on yourself.

110
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,030
I think you have self control.

111
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,670
Todd,

112
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,890
I think you're a wonderful man,

113
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:12,880
but you're,

114
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,080
you're hilarious.

115
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,680
And one of the reasons why you're
hilarious is because you're so,

116
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:18,731
you're free,

117
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,920
you're impulsive and that sort of debt,

118
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,190
it's very difficult for that to
lend itself to dietary discipline.

119
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:24,401
It's like,

120
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,330
how can I eat it?

121
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,164
Fuck it.

122
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,593
I'll just fucking eat it.

123
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,001
Right.

124
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,451
That's you.

125
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,300
But it's also part of what makes
you such a hilarious comic.

126
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,550
It's like you have these impulses.

127
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,310
It makes me feel better.

128
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,850
You don't want split the difference,

129
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,020
at least with what you're saying.

130
00:03:38,021 --> 00:03:40,690
You don't want this comfort
and you want to have fun.

131
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,111
And it's like,

132
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:41,741
it's right there.

133
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:42,170
They want to,

134
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,750
I want to eat that food.

135
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,613
Fuck it.

136
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,080
I thought of me like picture me at the,

137
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:47,890
at the uh,

138
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,040
cancer shoving cheesecake Uma in my mouth
and my friends are like looking at me

139
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:51,740
like Todd and I go,

140
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,880
okay,

141
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,910
Joe Rogan said that because I'm creative.

142
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:55,841
Good.

143
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:57,130
I see whatever I want.

144
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:57,964
He said,

145
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,310
go listen to his podcast.

146
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,570
He said that I should eat.

147
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,750
He calls Joe Rogan and you can go listen.

148
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,261
He said,

149
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,020
clear off the mini bar before
you get in your hotel beds,

150
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,310
even if you're not really
hungry because I'm creative.

151
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:12,640
Okay.

152
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,410
So I don't have control over this.

153
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,093
Okay.

154
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,940
Do you want to like meet in the middle of,

155
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:18,181
you're like,

156
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:18,391
okay,

157
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:18,901
it's legal,

158
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:19,860
but you can't name it.

159
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,411
Well,

160
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:24,240
do you think that you
could fuck a real doll?

161
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:24,421
I mean,

162
00:04:24,421 --> 00:04:25,890
you definitely could if you had to,

163
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,690
but would that be something
you'd be interested in?

164
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,550
I think I couldn't stop laughing at how
ridiculous this situation where I would

165
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,190
just jerk off and think about things.

166
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,170
I fucked a,

167
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,400
we had as a sponsor,

168
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,790
a flush left side.

169
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,100
I've had a flashlight forever.

170
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:38,671
Flash light.

171
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:40,080
It's very utilitarian.

172
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:41,490
You're not confusing yourself.

173
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,770
Nobody's ever said that
one before describing.

174
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,690
She's the girl of my dreams.

175
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,220
I've never even,

176
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,110
I've never used it.

177
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,690
I've had it forever.

178
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:49,920
I've never even thought about it.

179
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,690
I couldn't guess why I
would want to use it.

180
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,524
Seems Weird.

181
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,041
It's weird.

182
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:53,874
It feels good though.

183
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,210
Does it way better than jerking
off and engulfs your whole Dick.

184
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,541
Yeah,

185
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:01,920
and you put it in warm water and you
get it like to a temperature of a body

186
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,613
and you're like,

187
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:08,990
it's real.

188
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,591
Somehow or another.

189
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:11,520
This is like a portal,

190
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,190
like this tube is a
portal to another woman,

191
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:14,821
another dementia,

192
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:17,730
but all you can get out of
her vagina and just hold it.

193
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:18,061
That's it.

194
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:18,840
Feels real.

195
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,550
The name of this dimension
is called awesome.

196
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:24,210
Do you jerk off with a fleshlight
or do you hold it and fuck it?

197
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,451
No,

198
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:24,880
he jerked out.

199
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,713
You jerk off of this.

200
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,060
You jerked me off of the flashlight.

201
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:27,361
Yeah,

202
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,350
but that was for sure.

203
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,710
That was on camera behind the curt green.

204
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:32,544
This interview.

205
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,650
We did this on the podcast.

206
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:35,251
I swear to God,

207
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,180
he jerking off with the
flashlight producer.

208
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:37,770
No,

209
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,920
I couldn't get hard.

210
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,070
It was a female comic.

211
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,820
Whoa.

212
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,540
What's that about?

213
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,550
Is that a fuck real?

214
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,400
That's a real doctor.

215
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,740
Real though.

216
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,830
They're getting pretty good man.

217
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,880
They were redhead though,

218
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,710
was a documentary on Netflix about people
fucking sex robots really have come

219
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:56,430
far because there are people who fall in
love with these sex robots and it looks

220
00:05:56,431 --> 00:06:00,440
like the fucking taxi driver Johnny
on the spot from total recall.

221
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,730
It's like this is crazy.

222
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,680
Like animatronic Chuckie cheese,

223
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,514
bass player.

224
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,760
It's kind of get to a point where it can
totally mimic you and he's going to get

225
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:09,650
to a point where it really
is like blade runner.

226
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,513
Is that what they are now?

227
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:10,870
Yeah,

228
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,703
that's it.

229
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,420
I thought about buying a
dude one to do Jujitsu with

230
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,333
that was going to order one.

231
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,660
Clearly no Jake and a sealed bottle.

232
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,810
That proportions are perfect
because I have a dog.

233
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,910
Well it's this bubba dummy
the practice submissions on,

234
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,930
but it's super stiff.

235
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,650
It's like this,

236
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,361
but he beat you.

237
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:32,960
You basically can drill the moves,

238
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:37,010
but it's not the same as drill in
and on an anatomically correct body.

239
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,850
If you had an AMA anatomically
correct body to practice Jujitsu on,

240
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,770
you'd get some fucking tight moves.

241
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,420
But that can wait till the day when
you're announcing for robot fights.

242
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,970
No,

243
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,150
I a zero interest.

244
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:52,230
There's nothing at stake
if they live or die.

245
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,203
It doesn't matter.

246
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,490
The,

247
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,770
the whole thing about fighting is that
there's some horrible gigantic thing at

248
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,604
stake.

249
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,960
You can fuck one though.

250
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,540
Yeah.

251
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,230
You fuck with him?

252
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,060
I watch him fight.

253
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,200
Would you watch two robots?

254
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:04,034
Fuck.

255
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,240
That's how it goes.

256
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,631
It's weird.

257
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:06,500
Yeah man.

258
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:06,970
Thank you for,

259
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,140
do we need to say anything more
about the Brennan shop thing?

260
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,240
Did we cover it up enough man,

261
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,890
as far as it goes,

262
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,630
it's just like,

263
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,603
that's what I'm saying.

264
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,170
We,

265
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,810
we like,

266
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:19,450
we need to talk him and he you,

267
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,080
you know?

268
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,490
Yeah.

269
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,750
So it's a weird situation for me because
I love the guy and he's one of my best

270
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:27,950
friends and also I can't defend what
he said cause it doesn't totally make

271
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:28,311
sense.

272
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:28,850
Yeah.

273
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,530
And so like what I'm saying,

274
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:32,000
when I said he talks too much,

275
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,863
I do too.

276
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,160
I say stupid shit.

277
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,390
I don't mean to say stupid shit.

278
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:36,710
I don't say that stupid.

279
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,280
Um,

280
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,390
I didn't say that thing.

281
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,350
I wouldn't say it like that.

282
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,800
Yeah.

283
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,300
But sometimes you say things,

284
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,850
you don't even know why
the fuck you're saying it.

285
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,211
You know?

286
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:46,870
And a lot of it also was lost,

287
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,100
like just ranting.

288
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,641
Like you,

289
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:52,910
you're going to these rants and you say
shit and then you like see if you can

290
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:54,290
back it up once you set it.

291
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,741
Yeah.

292
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,510
Like just don't revisit dumb shit.

293
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,403
That's like,

294
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,490
it was insensitive.

295
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,810
It didn't make sense and it was
insensitive and I bet he regrets it.

296
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,880
Well,

297
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,713
I mean,

298
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,063
I don't know.

299
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,450
That's an assumption we're making,

300
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:08,661
right?

301
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:08,901
Yeah.

302
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm glad I know the guy.

303
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,320
That's why I'm saying it.

304
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:12,860
Yeah.

305
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,440
He's not a bad guy by any
stretch of the imagination.

306
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,180
He's awesome.

307
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,490
Um,

308
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,110
I'm not a of the of the,

309
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,320
I'm not the guy saying like,

310
00:08:19,321 --> 00:08:20,450
here are racist for saying this.

311
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:21,120
Like,

312
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,410
um,

313
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,071
like my,

314
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,630
my thing is when you're talking about the,

315
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:25,181
the first,

316
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,001
the initial part of it,

317
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,470
and I conveyed this to him,

318
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,400
you know,

319
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,090
was you're saying me or my brother or
my sister are good enough to be here.

320
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,180
So like that's,

321
00:08:33,181 --> 00:08:36,740
that's disrespectful because I fully
believe that we all are and that,

322
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:36,981
that,

323
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:37,221
that,

324
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:39,890
so that part and he apologized
for that and we're cool there,

325
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:40,580
you know,

326
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,270
and then,

327
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,480
then,

328
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,020
then why are you,

329
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,220
why are you talking about like,

330
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,770
this is what I see in
myself because no dog,

331
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,311
that's not,

332
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,360
that's not how it is.

333
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,510
No,

334
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:47,681
no,

335
00:08:47,681 --> 00:08:47,750
no,

336
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,440
no,

337
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,891
you're not,

338
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:50,120
you're not a psychologist,

339
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,140
not a psychiatrist.

340
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:54,200
You have no qualifications to,

341
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,650
to speak on my state.

342
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,010
Like,

343
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,251
like,

344
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,050
let's just weird too
that you guys haven't,

345
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,470
uh hmm.

346
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:01,890
I don't know.

347
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,850
I think sometimes someone says something
instead of just straight up saying they

348
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:06,684
fucked up.

349
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,950
They say I fucked up.

350
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,990
But yeah,

351
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:10,561
you know,

352
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,071
I fucking up.

353
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:11,611
But you know,

354
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,444
he's,

355
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,840
his issue is because of this or you know,

356
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,980
something else is going on with him.

357
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,840
It's making him react this way.

358
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:19,800
Yeah.

359
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,633
Yeah.

360
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,470
I'm more concerned with his pants.

361
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,430
Those shred it up pants and wears those
disturbing way more than what he said.

362
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,030
I can't,

363
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,990
can't defend neither one.

364
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,810
Yeah.

365
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,290
I'm just don't wear women's pants.

366
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,310
I don't think they're women's.

367
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,160
They just holding them.

368
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,180
They hold it on cause it back.

369
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,550
We went through that at the beginning
of the show and they have holding them.

370
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,750
It depends on how many holes,

371
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,613
right?

372
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,573
Like depends on like,

373
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:42,720
well,

374
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,800
if you earn those holes,

375
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,810
like if you work construction,

376
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,130
you got like a real hole.

377
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,341
Yeah.

378
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:47,761
You get you,

379
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,140
you get your pad snagged on it.

380
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:49,620
Yeah.

381
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,640
You gotta do what you gotta do.

382
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,031
You know,

383
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:51,840
if you're a farmer,

384
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,910
you got like real Barb
wire holes and your pants.

385
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,080
That's a different animal,

386
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,190
you know,

387
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:56,580
that's,

388
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,413
that's okay.

389
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,440
You earn those holes.

390
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,580
You wore your jeans out.

391
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,960
They started ripping in places.

392
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:01,770
Okay,

393
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,160
okay.

394
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,510
You can't afford to buy some new ones.

395
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:03,600
Yeah.

396
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,360
But if you paid a lot of mine for
pants that are already fucked up,

397
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,580
you saw that shit in a magazine somewhere.

398
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,740
That's what bothers me about Brendan

399
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,133
fucking pants.

400
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:23,130
Okay.
