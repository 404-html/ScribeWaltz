1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,110
you took a long time off,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,260
you took like six years off and then
came back again in 2010 for one fight.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,590
the,

6
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:11,420
I came back for that join you
because I got put into jail.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,080
I got put in prison and uh,

8
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,280
the,

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:14,640
you know,

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,260
it was funny because
after I got out of prison,

11
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,310
it was on national TV.

12
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:18,360
It was in all the newspapers,

13
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:18,871
magazines,

14
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,111
funny.

15
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:20,610
Holly or I start fading out of the media.

16
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:21,990
All of a sudden I get arrested.

17
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:23,550
I'm like a hot thing in the media again.

18
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,443
You know what I say?

19
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,153
If there's a shocker.

20
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,880
So that's why the media,

21
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:29,891
but anyway,

22
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:30,121
you know,

23
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:30,221
I,

24
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:30,400
I,

25
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,051
when I got out,

26
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:31,360
you know,

27
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,680
when I would go to bars and stuff,

28
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:33,040
he would say,

29
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,400
oh,

30
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,270
some people would say like,

31
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,050
oh,

32
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,160
I seen you on TV.

33
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:36,880
And I'm like,

34
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,713
fuck.

35
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,190
And I'm thinking to myself,

36
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,570
is that the one with me handcuff,

37
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:41,381
fuck in police?

38
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:44,120
Or was it an old god?

39
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:44,891
They hated that,

40
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,101
you know,

41
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:45,761
so I figured,

42
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:46,570
you know,

43
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:47,470
the only way to tell,

44
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:47,791
she'll,

45
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:48,250
um,

46
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,360
make it up to my fans.

47
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,440
I let them know that I'm back.

48
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:50,620
You know,

49
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:50,700
we,

50
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,120
we get drug to sit in Japan,

51
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:54,280
we get marijuana is a
big thing now in Japan.

52
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,540
We get tested for marijuana.

53
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,640
If you have any marijuana
in your blood in Japan,

54
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:58,540
you're not going to be able to fight it.

55
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,590
So what did you get arrested for?

56
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,513
Marijuana.

57
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,290
What happened?

58
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,471
Well,

59
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:05,480
I had a 16 grams in my car.

60
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,610
I had a great 20 joints I had,

61
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,760
we're going to have a little part in
your pony and it was on the way down.

62
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:14,120
And they do a lot of
inspections just randomly.

63
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,290
They walk around in Japan,

64
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:18,380
it's kind of unconstitutional where
they don't need a reason to search you.

65
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,210
They'll come right up to your car and say,

66
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:21,044
I want a chicken your car.

67
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,620
And it's like I was stone and I had a,

68
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,940
I had a joint,

69
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:28,190
I mean a real short on the dashboard.

70
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,770
And you know when you're still in,

71
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:32,350
you think you're getting sneaky with you.

72
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,440
It's like so bad.

73
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:33,710
It's like,

74
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,543
ah,

75
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:35,001
what,

76
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:35,834
what role?

77
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,880
And I'm putting in my pocket and they're,

78
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:38,990
they're following me the whole time.

79
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:39,950
Like you sit in their pocket.

80
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:40,311
And I'm like,

81
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:40,790
so I pull up,

82
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,960
put my phone in the pocket,

83
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,001
pull it behind my flight.

84
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,040
I said nothing in my pocket.

85
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:44,930
This is behind your phone though.

86
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,103
Fuck.

87
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,130
So what,

88
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:49,580
how,

89
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,630
like what is it like,

90
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,150
is it like being caught
with cocaine or heroin?

91
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,471
Drugs?

92
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,281
A drug in Japan.

93
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:55,460
Yeah.

94
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,440
So it doesn't matter.

95
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,291
Doesn't matter.

96
00:01:57,291 --> 00:01:57,501
Yeah.

97
00:01:57,501 --> 00:01:58,460
So I um,

98
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,440
I was facing some bad time,

99
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:00,621
you know,

100
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:01,370
because uh,

101
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,970
I was a famous figure and they
wanted to make an example to me,

102
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:05,804
so,

103
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,650
wow.

104
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,940
What was the worst case scenario?

105
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,500
I think it was five years.

106
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,420
Oh fuck.

107
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,343
Yeah.

108
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,210
So I was facing that.

109
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,044
Um,

110
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,980
it all depended on what came up in my
house and my gym when he did the search

111
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:19,814
the next day.

112
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,500
Wow.

113
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,380
And what came up?

114
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,100
Nothing.

115
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,761
Nothing came on.

116
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:23,630
So that saved you?

117
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,703
Yeah.

118
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,760
Well I was kind of baffled.

119
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,423
I

120
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,250
stole my fucking weed.

121
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,661
Nothing came up.

122
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:38,051
So,

123
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:38,884
um,

124
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,780
it was then the,

125
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,990
the integration came to finding
out where I got my stuff.

126
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,041
Oh yeah.

127
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:45,590
And you know,

128
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,210
sold.

129
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,380
When in Japan,

130
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,470
if you throw everything
to a foreign person,

131
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,620
they'll drop it.

132
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,420
They won't want to go
fight someone in America.

133
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,100
I told him it was a student from Guam.

134
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,440
They asked me for a name and I said Tony,

135
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,300
I knew like three Tonys and Guam,

136
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,120
so keep it real Tony.

137
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,400
And,

138
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,330
and we had like two days of questioning.

139
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,240
I mean you can talk in interrogation
for like eight hours straight.

140
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,750
Just interrogation and late,

141
00:03:15,751 --> 00:03:17,680
like the third day they said,

142
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,270
so happened caught me off guard man.

143
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,470
And the asked me,

144
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,070
what's Tony's last name and
this fricking ridiculous.

145
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,020
A first name that popped
the males Montana.

146
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,050
Read what?

147
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,300
I said.

148
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:33,661
That's a real one.

149
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:33,961
I said,

150
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:34,481
Montana,

151
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,320
I'll see those whole fuck
if these guys watch scarf.

152
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,230
Honestly I'm screwed.

153
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:40,491
You know what?

154
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:40,951
I'm screwed.

155
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:43,830
Because they will start the integration
all over if I get caught in a lie.

156
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,220
Right,

157
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:44,491
right,

158
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:44,910
right.

159
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,541
So he just,

160
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:49,680
I saw him write it down in Japanese in
Montana and then he just started on and I

161
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:49,960
was like,

162
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,793
Huh,

163
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,870
hello Scarface.

164
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,230
Scarface get translated into Japanese.

165
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,960
Not that popular.

166
00:03:58,961 --> 00:04:00,250
I don't think it's that popular there.

167
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:00,551
Yeah,

168
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,384
but

169
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,830
that's fucking hilarious.

170
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,171
Toni.

171
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:04,920
One time they gave me my marijuana,

172
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:05,754
you know.

173
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,020
How long was your worth,

174
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:07,854
the trip?

175
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,430
How long was your,

176
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,190
how long was the old or deal from him from

177
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,750
getting arrested to getting cleared?

178
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,983
28 days.

179
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,520
Which isn't a big deal if you
know what's going to be 28 days,

180
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,300
but you're sitting there and you don't
know what's going to happen to you and

181
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,970
you don't know what's going on in the
outside world cause you're shut off and

182
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:27,860
you're wondering if you're
going to spend five years.

183
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,650
It's kind of a 20 days is a long,

184
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:31,484
28 days.

185
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,433
Wow.

186
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,340
So you went from there and you said,

187
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:34,761
fuck it,

188
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:35,211
I'm going to,

189
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:36,590
I'm going to take on another fight.

190
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,440
He went there and it was
good for me actually.

191
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,330
I mean I always think back and think,

192
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:41,661
okay,

193
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,411
I should have done this.

194
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:43,101
I should've done this.

195
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:43,811
If I didn't put the roast,

196
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:44,450
Jeanette.

197
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,090
And I keep thinking that
and I catch myself and say,

198
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:46,924
wait a minute,

199
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,220
this is a probably one of the
best things that happened to you.

200
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,420
Cause the big,

201
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,000
biggest thing that happened
to be in that was I,

202
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,750
uh,

203
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,830
I learned how important it,

204
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:55,664
my freedom was.

205
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,210
I mean everyone takes it
for granted every day.

206
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,611
Wake up,

207
00:04:58,611 --> 00:04:58,701
well,

208
00:04:58,701 --> 00:04:59,511
what are you going to do today?

209
00:04:59,511 --> 00:04:59,961
And this like,

210
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:00,350
shit,

211
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,071
I got nothing to do.

212
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,940
His fricking overcast,

213
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:03,800
the shitty day.

214
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,180
What am I going to do it so hard.

215
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,461
Damn,

216
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:06,110
I miss this.

217
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:06,831
It's a Shitty Day,

218
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:07,011
you know?

219
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,000
But man,

220
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,190
just the fact that you can
choose to stay at home,

221
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,810
you can choose to eat McDonald's or you
can choose to just hang out or you can

222
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,770
choose to be bored,

223
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:16,070
you know,

224
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,640
freedom.

225
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,900
That's freedom's awesome.

226
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,470
So it was something that really made me
realize how far important freedom was.

227
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,131
Yeah.

228
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:23,690
A lot of people take it for granted.

229
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,390
You know,

230
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,540
you dealing with a situation like that,

231
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:30,320
especially over something like we'd
where it's so nonsensical and crazy,

232
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,290
they could take away your
freedom for fucking years.

233
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,500
Yeah.

234
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,640
The thing about that is a,

235
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,750
a man I serve the time,

236
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,440
um,

237
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,221
went to the court.

238
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:37,431
We,

239
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:40,490
I got three years probation where I
couldn't leave Japan for three years.

240
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:43,160
You didn't even get to go
to my grandma's funeral.

241
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,750
And I figured,

242
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:45,170
okay,

243
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,860
I gotta I gotta be good this three
years and then we'll start up again.

244
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,300
And then next thing I know
I get a letter from the,

245
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,134
um,

246
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,080
the immigration telling me that I,

247
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,490
I just lost my green card,

248
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,490
cause of infringement
and I got to leave Japan.

249
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,450
Whoa.

250
00:05:59,450 --> 00:05:59,781
And I'm like,

251
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:00,051
well,

252
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:00,560
wait a minute.

253
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,030
I've been here for 20 years.

254
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,060
My whole life is here.

255
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:03,920
I bought a house there,

256
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:04,980
I got Jim's here,

257
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,130
I can leave Japan.

258
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,670
So I called them up and they had
this like this real generic answer.

259
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:10,911
Okay,

260
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,110
if you're contesting it,

261
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,820
you were going to start an investigation,

262
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,340
you have to come down to
immigration center and blah,

263
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:16,521
blah,

264
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:16,850
blah.

265
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,390
Went down,

266
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,641
took it.

267
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,790
It was an eight month investigation.

268
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,110
I mean it was ridiculous.

269
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,680
I mean,

270
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,730
I have to go down there numerous times
and just like all day interrogations and

271
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:27,350
it would start from the beginning,

272
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,850
the name of your mom and dad.

273
00:06:28,851 --> 00:06:29,511
What do they do?

274
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,500
I'm they clipped the fuck.

275
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,760
Does that have to do in anything?

276
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:31,971
You know,

277
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:35,630
and I'm just going along with the Roy
and it's like the next week I go in for

278
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,300
another interrogation to start all
over again to a whole new investigator.

279
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,111
I'm like,

280
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:39,921
what the fuck's going on?

281
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:40,850
I just told the other guy,

282
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,031
you know,

283
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:41,960
and they got to a point,

284
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:46,250
it was so bad that I got so frustrated
in her as much as I needed to be in

285
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:46,641
Japan.

286
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:47,360
I looked at the guy said,

287
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,193
you know what,

288
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,700
I love Japan.

289
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,330
I made this place my home and it
fucking Japan doesn't want me.

290
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,380
I don't want to fucking be here.

291
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,020
I told him straight up
like that and was like,

292
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:56,601
I started them off.

293
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,650
Should I just screwed myself,

294
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,350
man,

295
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,520
boy,

296
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:58,701
I thought,

297
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:58,980
you know,

298
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,721
that's so frustrating.

299
00:06:59,721 --> 00:06:59,881
And so,

300
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:00,051
you know,

301
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:00,261
if you,

302
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,094
you know,

303
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,080
I served my time man and I'm,

304
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,981
and I'm trying to do,

305
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,150
I'm doing good things for Japan,

306
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:05,311
you know,

307
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:08,000
and you guys got to try and kick
me out if you guys don't want me,

308
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:08,271
you know what?

309
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,510
I don't want to fucking beer for them.

310
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,220
They don't want me here,

311
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,053
you know?

312
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,991
So you know,

313
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,730
they've interrogation went on and there
was one guy that was a phantom way when

314
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,280
he was interrogating me and then he,

315
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:18,631
he,

316
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:20,690
he kind of did something illegal where he,

317
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,771
he told me that the,

318
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:23,180
between these two red markers said,

319
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:24,200
look at those two triggers.

320
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,461
You sit.

321
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:25,430
And he flipped it open.

322
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:25,731
He said,

323
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:29,480
this is our petitions coming in for
you not to get kicked out of Japan.

324
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,730
And I saw the papers like this thick.

325
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:31,971
I was like,

326
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,361
well shit,

327
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:32,901
that's a lot.

328
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:33,170
He said,

329
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,291
yeah,

330
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,980
you got like 4,000 in
already and the petitioners,

331
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:37,100
your parent isn't just names,

332
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,120
you got to live your name,

333
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:38,751
your phone number,

334
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,190
your address and everything
and they'll see your ad.

335
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,580
It's not a bullshit where you can
just get people to sign their names,

336
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,503
just write some.

337
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,310
So they're writing this 4,000 and
every time we get an integration,

338
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:49,731
I see that,

339
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:49,970
that,

340
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,280
that between those two red markers
is getting thicker and thicker,

341
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,290
and I come through fine at the end,

342
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:57,200
it came out to be 9,008 months,

343
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:01,490
9,000 people sent in that they don't want
me to keep those Japan and immigration

344
00:08:01,491 --> 00:08:03,950
is dear to protect Japan from dangerous,

345
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,420
so-called dangerous foreigners.

346
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,770
So when they're,

347
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:08,510
there are people that they're
supposed to be protecting,

348
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,510
is sending in 9,000 letters saying
they don't want this guy kicked out.

349
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,830
So that was the overwhelming thing
that I could've been the boarded.

350
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,773
Yeah.

351
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,960
[inaudible].
