1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
There you go.
I know.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,733
It seems like we were

3
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,683
great.

4
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,340
Now we are going to go cancer.
No cans.

5
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:11,130
What are you going to do?
I'll,

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,690
I'll go with you.
I'm going to get a note.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,300
Cancer,
a fucking animal.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,050
Semans just connect man.
Let's mind meld.

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,860
I think in mind meld more with those 
things on really some weird way.

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,580
You were in each other's head.
I just hate my voice.

12
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:28,220
I sound like a woman.
You definitely don't sound like a woman.

13
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,323
Whenever I call for like tech support to
lead me through the first few steps and 

14
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:34,964
then I'll be like,
alright,

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,260
and then I hit delete and they'll be 
like,

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,150
no ma'am,
what you do is.

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,673
And then it's like it's too far into it 
for me to correct them because it feels 

18
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:44,264
too.
I'm too embarrassed to correct them at 

19
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:46,670
that point.
So then I just can't.

20
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,523
I just let them assume I'm alone for the
rest of the call and it's weird because 

21
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:54,980
then you see what it's like to be 
treated like a woman like he talks.

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,750
I find that they talked down to you more
like especially about tech support,

23
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:00,650
right?
Oh fuck.

24
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,823
A chick on a computer.
They treat you like you're a baby and 

25
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:12,101
now he's just screamed blue.
Shake your little mouse.

26
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,943
Why?
Why is there a difference in like tech 

27
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:19,634
stuff?
Like why are men more attracted to the 

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,690
tech stuff aren't,
aren't we more

29
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,510
mathematical than women?

30
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,440
Well,
that's a weird thing to say.

31
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,200
I mean there's right and left side of 
the brain,

32
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,100
right?
I would say yeah,

33
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,370
men are much more mathematical to women,
but I'm not mathematical even slightly.

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,263
So what am I a woman?
You just said that like you're going to 

35
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:45,310
kick my broad.
Like what do I read?

36
00:01:45,311 --> 00:01:47,590
Fucking chick lit.
I'm a fucking skirt.

37
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,910
I wish I was.
Man.

38
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,970
They get it made right now.
Women got it made.

39
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,250
How so?
Well,

40
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,430
because there's,
you know,

41
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:01,020
there's this sort of like postmodern 
feminism coming back where,

42
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,570
you know,
with this,

43
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,120
with the lean in and the like,
you know,

44
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:06,760
women really,
they really are going to start getting.

45
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,220
I think they're still making like eighty
cents on a dollar.

46
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,083
Do you know that's all bullshit.
I've heard you say that before and I 

47
00:02:11,471 --> 00:02:13,420
wanted to correct.
You know it's not true.

48
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,740
It's not.
It's not true.

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,753
No.
You know what that means when they say 

50
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,460
women make eighty cents of the dollar,
it means overall women make eighty cents

51
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:25,240
compared to the dollar that men make,
but not for the same jobs when women and

52
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:26,074
men are making,
making the same when they're doing the 

53
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:28,890
same job,
the,

54
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,743
the,
the problem with that statistic is it 

55
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,134
leads you to believe that a man and 
woman are working alongside each other 

56
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,060
doing the exact same amount of work,
the same amount of hours,

57
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,850
but the woman makes less.
It's not the case in the same.

58
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,693
Just a lot of executives.
It's been that have been found out to 

59
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:44,040
be.
I know a couple that were,

60
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,060
that are executives that were doing the 
same job,

61
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:48,010
leading the sales team and making less 
money.

62
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,680
Perhaps.
Perhaps there's a few exceptions,

63
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,560
but for the most part when you talk 
about overall jobs,

64
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,460
like it's pretty statistically proven 
that like lawyers,

65
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:58,294
doctors,
whatever the fuck the is when they're 

66
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:00,100
working

67
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,810
side by side,
it's very little disparity.

68
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,743
Yeah.
Very little podcast thing is women take 

69
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:10,570
time off for work time off of work,
for a maternity leave.

70
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,930
Of course if they have babies,
but also they tend to work less hours.

71
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,450
Men tend to be more ambitious,
more driven work,

72
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,210
more hours and they get paid more 
because of it.

73
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,560
Yeah,
that's what it is.

74
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,420
It's one of those weird ones where 
you're.

75
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,610
Everybody says it.
Even fucking Obama said it.

76
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,770
You know the wage gap,
the income gap.

77
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,880
Like what?
What do you mean?

78
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,050
Like why are you saying that?
Because you're.

79
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,923
You're talking about you talking about 
it as if there's some sort of 

80
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,294
discrimination when in fact there's a 
natural tendency that a lot of women 

81
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,900
have to choose different jobs.
Like as far as like nursing,

82
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:45,580
like overwhelmingly a.
it's predominantly women.

83
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,443
So you're saying if you take the total 
amount women make versus the total 

84
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,020
amount,
men May.

85
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,820
That's where the eighty cents on the 
dollar difference,

86
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:53,260
but it's the job choices.

87
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,210
You're saying the exact right job 
choices.

88
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,010
Men are much more likely to die on the 
job.

89
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,840
Yeah.
Um,

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,673
men,
men are much more likely to take high 

91
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:02,980
paying high risk jobs like mining things
on those lines.

92
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,750
Yeah.
So that's what that is.

93
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,703
It's one of those weird ones where you 
repeated a lot of people repeat it and 

94
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,823
they think it's right.
They think that men and women who are 

95
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:11,740
working alongside each other making the 
same amount of money.

96
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,173
The other thing about executives is,
and this is something that no one wants 

97
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:21,910
to say because it sounds sexist,
but it might be that the men are earning

98
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:22,744
more money.
Like it might not just be that they're 

99
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,024
making more money.
It might be their actual performance as 

100
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:30,580
an executive is better.
It's entirely possible.

101
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,700
It is possible.
But I can also see,

102
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,550
um,
like if I hired a man and a woman,

103
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,800
I would pay the woman less

104
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,000
just because you know,
men are just.

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,313
Did you better looking?
You want them around more women are 

106
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:50,634
gross.
How dare you leave periods who I like 

107
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,653
literally if you.
Why would I pay somebody who's bleeding 

108
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,474
on the job as much as a man?
I'm glad I never have to have a 

109
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:08,210
workforce.
I mean,

110
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:09,750
what do you got?
But he got one guy.

111
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:11,460
You got to.
You got a few people working for you.

112
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,900
Yeah,
but they're guys.

113
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,590
Call guys.
Sexy guys.

114
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,420
Okay.
You're a good looking guy.

115
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,540
Jamie is not a bad looking dude.
You play sports.

116
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,400
What'd you play?
I played back in high school.

117
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,740
I played basketball for four years.
For the city.

118
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,720
For three?
Yeah.

119
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:28,950
You got a lot of pussy.
I bet.

120
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,250
How old were you when you lost your 
virginity?

121
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,860
Oh,
17.

122
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,930
Slow.
A little slow on the uptake there?

123
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,413
Yeah.
17.

124
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,280
You want to choose wisely?
How old were you?

125
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,550
16.
15.

126
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,940
Almost 16.
Maybe older woman.

127
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:47,440
I bet.
No,

128
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:52,120
I got molested by a girl when I was 13 
and she was 21,

129
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,020
but nothing really happened.
It was one of those weird ones,

130
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:56,854
like she was grabbing my deck.
I was all confused and I made out with 

131
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,564
her,
but I was like,

132
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,570
how are we doing here now?
She's so confused.

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,710
I.
You hit puberty yet.

134
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
I mean,
I guess I was 13.

135
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:09,070
When do you hit puberty?
I didn't hit until I was 15.

136
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,750
I wasn't beating off at the time.
I actually had sex before.

137
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,840
Beat off.
No Shit.

138
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,920
Yeah,
well I was just,

139
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,310
I didn't.
Once I figured out beating off though,

140
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:23,750
I was like,
oh,

141
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,830
I'm a slave.
I'm a slave to getting rid of this.

142
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:29,390
Come up.
Like,

143
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,283
oh no.
And then I realized like once I beat 

144
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:32,840
off,
I was like,

145
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,640
oh,
why can do this myself?

146
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,460
And then I'm not so fucking needy and 
weird.

147
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,443
I remember the first time I was dating 
this girl and the first time I beat off 

148
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,850
and then I was like,
I don't even want to call her.

149
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:44,923
Yeah,
I got,

150
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,250
I don't want to hang out with her.
Like,

151
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,940
this is annoying.
And I realized like,

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,760
Oh,
I wasn't so much that I was attracted to

153
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:54,630
her.
Was that not that it wasn't attractor.

154
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,100
It wasn't so much that I enjoyed being 
around her.

155
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,083
I was,
I wanted to have sex with her and then 

156
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:04,130
once the sex was taken out once a book 
get rid of the load,

157
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,840
I was like,
oh,

158
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:09,860
I don't really want to be around her.
This is just some biological trick.

159
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,753
Yeah.
Like my body's tricking me into wanting 

160
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:13,880
to be near her and hanging around with 
her.

161
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,710
Yeah.

162
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,131
Weird.
Yeah.

163
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:15,964
Because teenage boys and girls have sell
a little income and all you care about 

164
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:23,830
is sports laughing,
trying to get fucked up will,

165
00:07:23,831 --> 00:07:26,640
you didn't really do that.
But like we did and then uh,

166
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:29,980
and girls at that age are just extremely
social beings.

167
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,310
They're very much about,
um,

168
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,340
their social circle and um,
you know,

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,410
establishing who's in the group.
And he was like,

170
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:41,110
I'm just talking about my,
my daughter is like this.

171
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,303
And I think that they're much more like 
in line with what school is telling you 

172
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:46,750
to do.
You know,

173
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:47,584
they tend to do better in school because
they're a little bit more linear and 

174
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:52,330
they uh,
they,

175
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,313
they're self motivated more than boys 
where we just were just distracted too 

176
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:57,280
much.

177
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,220
I think what boys also have like a 
serious problem with authority,

178
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,170
I want to.
Teachers are telling you what to do.

179
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:03,004
You automatically don't want to do it.
That's just a natural inclination that 

180
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:09,250
people have of now I'm getting scared.
Yeah,

181
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,573
that's illegal though.
Can blow it in my face on legal problem 

182
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:14,100
with that.
Yeah,

183
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,173
that's totally illegal.
I got a total second hand high and the 

184
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,400
Green Room at the comedy store the other
night.

185
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,530
Holy Shit.
That was like,

186
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:26,400
there was a cigar going,
five joints going.

187
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,670
Ron White doesn't play.
He pulled out a joint yesterday.

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,250
We killed the joint and after the join 
pulled out,

189
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:34,870
one of those vape pens is big gigantic 
robot Dick.

190
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm like,
Jesus,

191
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,250
wrong.
It goes that weed is like,

192
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,084
Oh hell yeah,
it's,

193
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,870
we good Lord.
So he's got a cigar going.

194
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,733
He brought it,
brings his own Tequila because he now 

195
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,370
has his own Tequila company.
Now he does this.

196
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:48,204
He does,
so he has its number one Tequila 

197
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,100
Tequila,
so he brings this bottle of Tequila.

198
00:08:53,101 --> 00:08:56,010
It's really good Tequila and then he's 
smoking a cigar.

199
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,010
He's passing out shots,
he's brings cups back there,

200
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,790
handing out shots of his Tequila.
Ron Wyden is damn walking party.

201
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,990
He is a walking part.

202
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,310
Hydro drove home the other night because
he doesn't drink and drive and he really

203
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,960
admire.
He goes to me,

204
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,630
he goes,
hey,

205
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,023
you want to just dry dry,
be home with my truck and then take an 

206
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,170
uber back and then he hit your car and 
drive home.

207
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:18,891
I'm like,
yeah,

208
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,150
that's not happening.
I go,

209
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:22,640
you want a ride home?
And he's like,

210
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:23,391
uh,
yeah,

211
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:24,620
I'll take a ride home.
I'll leave.

212
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,570
I'll leave my truck here.
So,

213
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,250
uh,
so he gets in my Prius,

214
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:32,540
which immediately he gives me shit for 
the entire way he can barely fit in it.

215
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,010
And uh,
and we,

216
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,890
we get,
we are and I'm going down sunset here.

217
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:37,730
Yeah,
go down this way.

218
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:40,310
So I'm driving.
All of a sudden we hit like Beverly Glen

219
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,900
and I'm like,
where's your fucking house?

220
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:42,980
He goes,
where are we?

221
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:43,814
I go,
we're in fucking like ballet or 

222
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,360
something,
and so he's like,

223
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:47,721
no,
no,

224
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:48,380
no,
go back.

225
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,890
So we go back all the way to the comedy 
store and start from scratch,

226
00:09:51,891 --> 00:09:52,724
start from scratch,
take a right down there and then I'm 

227
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:57,890
going down a fucking cannon or something
and he's like,

228
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,010
uh,
Nah,

229
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,140
you went too far.
I'm like,

230
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,350
how the fuck did I know I was going too 
far?

231
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,600
What was far?
What was the spot?

232
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,750
And then I can't make a left.
So you guys just make a left.

233
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,060
I'm late.
My wife is going to be why?

234
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,720
I told her I was gonna be over at 10:30.
I'm like,

235
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,703
look,
I'm not getting a fucking t the middle 

236
00:10:13,731 --> 00:10:17,630
of Beverly Hills where you get ticketed 
for fucking picking your nose.

237
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,310
I'm not making the legal levies.
Like,

238
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,121
no,
make the left.

239
00:10:20,121 --> 00:10:20,954
I'm not making the fucking left.
So I go past it and I doubled back and 

240
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:25,184
then I get,
I get to his place and his place is a 

241
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
hotel.
Did he talk about this on your show?

242
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,970
Why don't want to like do it is 
personal.

243
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,030
You definitely said the name of the 
hotel,

244
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:36,864
but he,
he had a water problem and it's not 

245
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,873
about that,
right.

246
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,023
He spent like,
I think more than two years building 

247
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:48,090
this house.
He told me five years,

248
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,930
bought it and then they had to get the 
plans approved and then the building.

249
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,823
Yeah.
So it was a total process of about five 

250
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,064
years.
Right.

251
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,993
So I think,
but I think it was two solid years in 

252
00:10:58,051 --> 00:10:59,000
building this house.
Right.

253
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,843
So he goes out of town and a water 
faucet broke and the whole house from 

254
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,540
the top floor flooded all the way down 
to the bottom.

255
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,403
All the walls have fucking fungus and 
mold in them and it's a complete tear 

256
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:12,230
down.

257
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,920
Have you ever had that happen to you 
ever have like a fungus or mold issue?

258
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,880
Yeah,
we did.

259
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,010
And um,
it wasn't lethal.

260
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:20,844
We got to test it.
It was a mold and my wife's very 

261
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:23,364
sensitive to it,
so she was getting all kinds of like 

262
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,703
allergies from it and they came in and 
the testing is fucking expensive and it 

263
00:11:29,941 --> 00:11:30,571
was just,
you know,

264
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:32,670
it was just a leaky pipe under the house
and you know,

265
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,720
it's in Venice so it's,
it's kind of moist down there and uh,

266
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,730
they just,
you know,

267
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,300
they,
they shaved it out.

268
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,680
Bag.
No,

269
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,330
no big deal now.
But if it's the wrong kind of mold,

270
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:47,220
I mean it can cause fucking,
like your brain can go.

271
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,060
Do you remember that Tom?
Like this guy,

272
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,940
very nice guy,
great guy.

273
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,200
Tom Like is

274
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
Tuesdays crazy?
What a whip them out Wednesday to know 

275
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:03,040
what you're driving.
I had one opie and Anthony had whip them

276
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,110
out Wednesday,
right?

277
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
Tom had like flash Friday.
Yeah,

278
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,310
driving down a highway or the road and 
you show your tits to guys and then they

279
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,144
call in and then you know,
opie and Anthony got mad because they 

280
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:18,900
thought that Tom has stole the idea 
from.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,140
And I'm like,
listen boys,

282
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,630
it's just gets the more tickets come 
out,

283
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:23,410
the better.
Don't stop.

284
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,020
Not Encouraging people,
what are you doing?

285
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,770
Every radio one of the country should 
have a day where women share their kids.

286
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,633
I mean,
it should be just a part of what people 

287
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:33,490
do.
I was doing,

288
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,121
uh,
you know,

289
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,850
Bubba,
the love sponge right down in Tampa.

290
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,713
That dude is fucking out there as we 
know because his wife had sex with all 

291
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,870
Kogan and there was a video tape of it 
going around,

292
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,440
which he basically got a web.

293
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,440
What's the website that gets shut down 
because of Gawker fucking folded because

294
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:56,500
of that lawsuit from Baba or was there a
wait who did the lawsuit?

295
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,840
Baba or hall collected.
Oh,

296
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,830
hulk did it.
So I go down above his place and it's so

297
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:07,831
weird because Tampa is a fucking eerie 
mystical place anyway.

298
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,303
And so they picked me up to go to radio 
and we're going down these back roads 

299
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:17,950
through swamps and shit.
And we pass a girl scout camp and um,

300
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,580
and then all of a sudden there's this 
long driveway.

301
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:23,110
It's like a picture,
like you picture,

302
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:25,700
like the allman brothers must be making 
a new album at the end of this,

303
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,663
this fucking read the shack and you go 
back there and he'd go in and they're 

304
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:31,511
like,
all right,

305
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,490
this is Bob's place,
and there's a.

306
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,650
there's a midget on a couch in the 
waiting room,

307
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:36,400
and he pissed.

308
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,850
He had pissed the couch,
like they got them drunk on the show,

309
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:40,684
so drunk that he,
that he pissed themselves in the 

310
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,540
studios.
They put them out on the couch.

311
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,670
Oh my God.
He was angry.

312
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,260
He was angry at me and I'm like,
dude,

313
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,780
I have no idea your situation.
I just guide.

314
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,733
I'm next.
And so I walk in and everybody's 

315
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:55,780
drinking pabst blue ribbon.
This is like 7:00

316
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:59,020
in the morning drinking pabst blue 
ribbon and they.

317
00:13:59,021 --> 00:13:59,854
They gave me this joint to smoke,
which I didn't expect it to be that 

318
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,270
strong and I,
I was.

319
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,223
I was ripped out of my mind.
So I go into the studio and Bubba has a 

320
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:16,651
12 gauge Israeli handgun,
which is a fucking monster,

321
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,620
a shotgun,
handguns,

322
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,690
something like that.
He pulls out this huge 12 gauges,

323
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:25,210
like a shotgun.
He said it was a 12 gauge.

324
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,050
Maybe I got it wrong,
but it's huge.

325
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,510
It's huge.
Pulls it out and he's like,

326
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,380
my phone just started googling.
You just say,

327
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:37,600
Hey Siri.
And then now it's doing.

328
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,210
And um,
so he pulls it out.

329
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:40,590
He's like,
Nah,

330
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,381
Nah,
it's cool.

331
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,900
And I'm like,
well then why did your entire staff just

332
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:44,734
fucking run out of the studio?
And I'm the only one in here and I'm 

333
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,150
stoned in 7:00
in the morning.

334
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,750
And so he's waving it around and then he
starts taking calls because he sends,

335
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,020
he sends this van out,
they call it the hand job,

336
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:02,080
the handicap van,
and they pull up to office buildings and

337
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:02,984
they entice guys to get in the van with 
his hooker who gives them handjobs live 

338
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,410
on the radio before they go to work.

339
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,943
And that goes on.
And then a call comes in from a guy 

340
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,990
who's about to rob a bank in Michigan,
I guess to show syndicates to Michigan.

341
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,320
And so he's talking this guy out of 
robbing a bank.

342
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,760
The guy was for real.
Oh my God.

343
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,190
And uh,
and so,

344
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,083
and this all goes on.
I mean this went on for like two and a 

345
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,610
half hours and then all the sudden it 
just ended and I walked out.

346
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:36,830
I felt like a,
I felt like,

347
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:40,190
what's his name and in Training Day,
uh,

348
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,900
Ethan Hawke,
you know,

349
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:46,550
after he just tripped and been lead 
through this gauntlet of and uh,

350
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,440
and I,
I go back every time.

351
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,200
I love it.
I did it once.

352
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,370
It was fun.
Yeah,

353
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,840
it was a good dude.
The,

354
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,730
the,
the morning radio thing.

355
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,910
Conduct and fucking get you.
Yeah.

356
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,343
I was just thinking,
what was that guy who was an athlete 

357
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,000
that shot his driver?

358
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,850
Do you remember that story?
It was a radio guy.

359
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,743
No,
he was a professional athlete and he 

360
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:12,980
pulled out a gun.
Jason Williams does that,

361
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,470
who it is that his name?
Um,

362
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,573
but he had like a,
a limo driver and apparently he pulled 

363
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:20,054
out a gun.
He was like playing with a gun and 

364
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,500
accidentally shot and killed his limo 
driver.

365
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,360
And it was like,
whoa.

366
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,550
Wow,
look what the fuck?

367
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,490
Jason Williams,
he was a basketball player,

368
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,570
like pulp fiction.
I mean that kind of stuff happens.

369
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:38,890
Imagine if you got shot by bubble,
the last punch.

370
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,953
Like that's how it ends.
That's how you go to the next stage of 

371
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:44,570
life.
You got accidentally shot by Baba.

372
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,430
Yeah,
dude,

373
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,320
here it is.
Williams.

374
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,360
I was a coward for covering up shooting 
of the limo driver.

375
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,603
I mean is he free now?
Spent 26 months in prison and starting 

376
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:01,420
in 2010.
So yeah,

377
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:05,860
maybe battled with alcoholism.
Well here's the thing.

378
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,620
Incredibly shadow with a 12 gauge 
shotgun.

379
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,123
But here's the thing.
Say you kill a guy by accident with a 

380
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:20,721
gun.
You then have a choice to cover it up or

381
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:24,130
come forward and say,
I did this whole shit.

382
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,200
Now existentially,

383
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,780
is it so wrong to cover it up?
I mean,

384
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,760
you're going to feel bad for the rest of
your life.

385
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,953
You don't really need to be punished.
It's not going to change how his family 

386
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:39,080
feels about it.
Just say somebody else shot him.

387
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,580
That's a DB argument.
A DB argument about ethics.

388
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,143
[inaudible].
You're gonna.

389
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,040
You know you're going to face a of

390
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,800
hate of hate,
right?

391
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,560
No one's going to believe you have you 
say it was an accident.

392
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,960
People are gonna.
Absolutely.

393
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:02,800
Assume that he murdered them.
You know they're going to pursue it that

394
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,790
way.
But on the other hand,

395
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,550
you did fucking kill a guy.

396
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,623
Alright,
what if here's it more innocuous 

397
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:10,844
situation.
You're driving down an alley late at 

398
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,380
night and a homeless person walks out in
front of your car and you hit him and he

399
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:22,760
dies.
You can either just drive away,

400
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:27,290
wash your car and know that a homeless 
guy is no more.

401
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,610
Or you can go get the police and say,
yeah,

402
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,640
I was speeding and I killed a man.
It's like that Johnny cash song.

403
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Isn't it fascinating that when you say 
that story,

404
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,173
when you give that scenario that a 
homeless person in some way or another 

405
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:50,460
makes it like less fucked up?

406
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,813
No,
I just made in terms of like the family 

407
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,190
blaming you for it.
Nobody's going to blame me for

408
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,520
for this,
but,

409
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,473
but even even so,
like it's not as bad as scenario as 

410
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:04,890
hitting a nice person who's got their 
shit together.

411
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,903
Well,
it's like if you kill somebody and you 

412
00:19:07,931 --> 00:19:10,900
get sued by the family,
depending on it.

413
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,420
Like if you,
if you kill a child and you get sued,

414
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,730
they're not.
You don't have to pay a lot of money,

415
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,610
but if you kill a guy who's supporting 
his family,

416
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,440
they,
they'll take everything you got.

417
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,140
So that life in the eyes of the,
the law is

418
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,030
worth more.
How strange is it that we put a monetary

419
00:19:30,031 --> 00:19:34,830
value on actual life itself?
Wow.

420
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,790
It's just such a strange,
strange concept.

421
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:39,923
Yeah.
Did you see that guy accidentally hit 

422
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:45,190
that Moose with his car now?
Holy Shit,

423
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:46,280
Jamie.
Pull that video up.

424
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,713
I tweeted it.
This guy's driving down the road 

425
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,793
somewhere probably near where they 
kicked you out of that club that one 

426
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:55,930
night

427
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,763
made you drive home and drive home and 
because of Moose they kicked you out in 

428
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,420
great detail.
It was supposed to be a clean gig.

429
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:05,650
He gets up there,
he starts swearing,

430
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,780
they kicked him out,
they kicked him out.

431
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,290
They had his bags packed.
By the time he gets off stage,

432
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,523
spend the night at the hotel after you 
do the Gig and they fucking five hours 

433
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,113
drive.

434
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,773
Whoa.

435
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,050
Oh

436
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,630
yeah.
Fucking

437
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,690
crazy,
crazy.

438
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,570
Everybody else has slowed down all these
other people.

439
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:29,404
It's slowed down a route.
People had seen the Moose and they were 

440
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,570
kind of checking it out,
but look,

441
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:38,260
this guy fucking hits it full on and 
since everything flying,

442
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,340
that was like an Olympic big

443
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,530
tumble.
You gotta wonder like,

444
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,483
is that Moose dead now?
I'm surprised the car wasn't trashed 

445
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,070
more.
Do you think Moose is dead?

446
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,240
Got Up and walked away.
Oh,

447
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:50,260
Jesus,
look at that.

448
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,453
That is insane.
Something flew off and he lost her 

449
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,350
first.
Fuck right.

450
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,850
You can create an animal.
No,

451
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,930
no,
not like that.

452
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:02,920
I've hit squirrels and rabbits.
I ran over a raccoon with a big wreck.

453
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,813
Oh Jesus.
It made a big thumping noise under the 

454
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:06,220
car.
I've.

455
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,780
I was grossed out for hours.
Just disturbed.

456
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,150
Boom.
Look at that and that thing goes flying.

457
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,110
That's a huge animal.
Yeah,

458
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,980
they're dangerous in that sense.
Yeah.

459
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,170
No,
I think most are dangerous in the wild.

460
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,560
They can be there.
One of the few deer species that will go

461
00:21:26,561 --> 00:21:27,400
after you.
Yeah,

462
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,133
probably the only one.
I mean maybe an elk would go after you 

463
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,633
maybe,
but it's pretty rare like you have to 

464
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:38,380
fuck up to get an elk to attack you.

465
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,323
Yeah.
But if you're too close to a Mama Moose 

466
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,980
and she's got her babies in there,
she'll just fuck you up.

467
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,310
Yeah.
There was this kid that got killed.

468
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,173
I want to say it was on a campus 
somewhere in Alaska and apparently 

469
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,384
someone had been throwing snowballs at 
the Moose and they had agitated the 

470
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:59,920
Moose and this guy just walked in wrong 
place,

471
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:02,920
wrong time and the Moose just starts 
stomping the shit out of them.

472
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,773
It's really hard to watch.
This guy just gets stomped and stomped 

473
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,204
and stomped by this huge animal and 
she's rearing up and trying to kill him 

474
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,730
and keep stomping on him.
It was horrific.

475
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,620
He just bang,
Bang,

476
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,660
Bang.
Just getting pummeled by these.

477
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,973
I mean this thing is a thousand pounds 
and it was because they were throwing 

478
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:27,814
snowballs at him because somebody else 
apparently had been agitating the Moose 

479
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:32,770
before this guy got there.
Yeah.

480
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,110
Don't fuck with wildlife,
man.

481
00:22:37,111 --> 00:22:38,520
Had that gun.
Not Gun.

482
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,320
That's a bad one to fuck with.
You know,

483
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,963
you gotta think in their environment.
They're fighting off bears and wolves 

484
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:46,354
and shit.
They just constantly like kicking at 

485
00:22:47,891 --> 00:22:49,750
things.
Yeah.

486
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,870
Have you ever been.
Not attacked,

487
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,630
but have you had an animal?
Like had you lined up in the cross hairs

488
00:22:55,631 --> 00:22:59,380
when you're hunting or anything?
Not that I know.

489
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:02,730
Have you ever had a bear like come out 
about a bear?

490
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,930
I've had a bear,
like encounters with bears.

491
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,520
It's weird.
You see them,

492
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:08,310
but most of the time they just run away.
Yeah,

493
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,660
like A.
I saw a grizzly bear once.

494
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,303
That was a weird one because they have a
different way of looking at you as 

495
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:15,874
opposed to like a regular beer does.
Like a brown bear is a more aggressive 

496
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:23,290
bear in terms of like a,
it's more of a hunter or as black bears,

497
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:23,650
they're.

498
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,270
They're kind of hunters,
but they're more.

499
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,450
I think they tend to eat more berries 
and things along those lines,

500
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:29,703
but those big ass brown bears,
they have to be like really aggressive 

501
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:37,780
because they're so big.
Like you've got to feed a thousand pound

502
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:39,580
body or whatever the fuck.
Did they eat meat?

503
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,800
Oh yeah.
What do they eat?

504
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,990
Bears eat a lot of crazy shit,
man.

505
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,330
They'll eat like a beached whale.
They'll camp out on a beach.

506
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:51,170
Whale eat that fucking thing for is 
rotten and disgusting.

507
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,033
Wow.
That's one of the best places that 

508
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:56,150
people find them.
If you want to go bear sighting,

509
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,750
you want to go looking for bears and 
spot those big Kodiak bears.

510
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,020
They go to places where bears would find
like a dead whale.

511
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,130
It's almost lover.
Yeah.

512
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,520
It just gets rancid and disgusting and 
they're still chewing it up,

513
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,820
but they,
they just have to eat a lot.

514
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,930
What's your,
uh,

515
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:17,910
what you usually kill something for the 
winter to eat.

516
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:18,744
Right?
Usually an elk who is ever going to go 

517
00:24:20,371 --> 00:24:21,204
for this year,
trying to either got one already this 

518
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,250
year.
How you did.

519
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,970
Okay.
Is that the one you were carrying?

520
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,800
Um,
when,

521
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,223
when you show me a picture of you 
fucking carrying an animal on your back 

522
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,840
that you had killed.

523
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,860
I think that was a different one.
Yeah.

524
00:24:35,861 --> 00:24:38,320
You can't carry an elk on your back.
It's way too big.

525
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,070
Yeah.
And silk is like a thousand pounds.

526
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,430
So you cut it up out in the wild.
We'll put it in coolers or something.

527
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,493
I did it at this ranch and they have a 
bunch of guys that work at the ranch 

528
00:24:50,981 --> 00:24:51,814
that just drag it into a pickup truck 
and then you take it to like this cold 

529
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:59,410
storage area and the cold storage area 
that break it down.

530
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,453
Yeah.
But what you do is you just cut the 

531
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,083
quarters off,
you cut the legs off and you break it 

532
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,480
down just like a butcher shop does 
freely.

533
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,640
Very.
Um,

534
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,200
it's very weird to see man because it 
becomes meat.

535
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,093
Like it starts off an animal and then it
becomes meat as opposed to just seeing 

536
00:25:18,581 --> 00:25:21,400
meet,
like once.

537
00:25:21,401 --> 00:25:23,740
It's once it's down and it's,
you know,

538
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:26,950
you start breaking it down.
It's like a sober,

539
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,963
sober reminder of what meat actually is.
One day they're going to have that lab 

540
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,580
to test tube meat that they're working 
on,

541
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,630
you know,
that stuff they're doing.

542
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,183
One day they're going to have that.
That's going to be like fully fully 

543
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,570
available and there's going to be no 
more.

544
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,640
Last night I was talking to the,
uh,

545
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,430
the chef at the laugh factory or the 
comedy store,

546
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,870
you know,
the cook back there.

547
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:56,240
Got It.
Just fucking smiles all the time.

548
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,190
If you want some good energy man,
just go,

549
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,080
go back there and talk to that guy for a
little while.

550
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,310
And I'm like,
so what'd you,

551
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,960
what'd you eat for Christmas would you 
make?

552
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,230
And he goes,
I think that Turkey.

553
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,463
I got it up.
I put it in the blender with a little 

554
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:13,370
bit of oil and I flag it and chop it up,
put it on sandwiches with some lessons.

555
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,950
I gave it to my kids.
I'm like,

556
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,320
you blend fucking Turkey meat.
Oh yeah man.

557
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,740
Oh Wow.
I go,

558
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:26,240
what else do you put in the blender 
goes?

559
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,840
Just a little bit of oil.
Maybe it's good.

560
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,080
That sounds like a,
like a chicken salad type thing,

561
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,310
right?
Sounds good.

562
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,500
And you jen,
that would keep after that.

563
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:38,720
I mean we have so much goddamn Turkey 
meat in our fridge.

564
00:26:38,721 --> 00:26:41,900
We got Turkey and ham meat because we 
did a couple of different dinners.

565
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,710
Do you do the deep Turkey

566
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,070
now?
I hear that.

567
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,580
The way to get the way to go.
You have a fryer?

568
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,510
Yeah.
You get a,

569
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,343
like a,
you could buy them where you stick the 

570
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:52,560
Turkey.
Uh,

571
00:26:52,561 --> 00:26:53,394
like uh,
like,

572
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,343
like these prongs stick into it.
And then he just sort of lower it into 

573
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:59,340
this,
this Vat for like 20 minutes.

574
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,174
Right.
It's like there's a certain time per 

575
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,470
pound of bird.
The bird is,

576
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,640
but it's so good dude,
because he had cook it in peanut oil and

577
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:12,270
it's just juicy and delicious and crispy
on the outside.

578
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:14,160
It's my all time favorite way to get a 
Turkey.

579
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,080
Yeah.
Oh,

580
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,390
but man,
turkeys,

581
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,400
that's all that factory farm shit is.
As I get older it's freaking me out more

582
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,780
and more.
It freaks me out.

583
00:27:24,781 --> 00:27:25,614
Like buying chickens in the store freaks
me out because of the way you know they 

584
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,370
were treated or a hundred percent.

585
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,233
Yeah.
Yeah.

586
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,070
Chickens for the.
That's the big one.

587
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:35,760
That freaks me out because there's 
something like chickens and pigs because

588
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:38,010
there's something that we do with 
chickens where you would.

589
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,820
You can't really do with a cow.
We stack them on top of each other.

590
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,030
Just smoosh them all into these places 
where they can't even fucking move.

591
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,893
They just stuck there and then they wait
until they get to a certain size and 

592
00:27:50,681 --> 00:27:52,250
then they kill them and it's like,
oof.

593
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,900
What does that mean?
They're like a.

594
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:59,990
it's like they're a human or not human.
A living organism that's,

595
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,160
that's a battery,
like a power supplies.

596
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,023
They doing it.
The pumping them full of chemicals that 

597
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,000
make them get fatter and big.
I don't know.

598
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,730
I know they definitely have used 
chemicals on the birds,

599
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:12,564
I'm sure,
but I don't know if they use on them on 

600
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:15,060
them all the time.

601
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,660
I think the thing that's going on with 
those birds is genetic selection.

602
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,523
Yeah.
Where they've just genetically made 

603
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,750
certain birds breed with certain birds.
They've established this gene does,

604
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:27,551
uh,
this,

605
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:28,384
uh,
genetic selection where they're just 

606
00:28:29,581 --> 00:28:30,414
like super fucking plump and like 
ridiculously big breasts and then they 

607
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,370
get those to do that in a very short 
period of time.

608
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,360
And then they kill them and they can't 
walk because their chests are so big.

609
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:43,690
They fall over forward.
Yeah.

610
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,700
Well it's like what they did with 
bulldogs,

611
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,090
like how the fuck did they make a 
bulldog out of a wolf?

612
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,190
Yeah.
How'd they do?

613
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,360
Who knows?
That's why they can't fucking breathe.

614
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

615
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:55,350
Pugs.
So sad.

616
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:57,930
It's so sad.
That was a wolf and they made,

617
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,170
they made the face smaller because they 
wanted it to be cuter.

618
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:02,603
Acute,
a cute dogs having a fucking asthma 

619
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:09,681
attack his entire life to the house.
Two ranges that you have at the chickens

620
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:11,994
and I think the only criteria for the 
chicken pen is that the chicken has to 

621
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:17,160
be able to turn around in it.
That's it.

622
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,030
That's how big it has to be.
That's so crazy and they're getting shit

623
00:29:21,031 --> 00:29:24,330
on by all the chickens above it their 
whole life.

624
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,610
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

625
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,830
I know.
Is that really how it works?

626
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,660
How many do they stack on top of each 
other?

627
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,270
12 for real now.
I don't know,

628
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,350
but a lot.
Say 100.

629
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,550
One went crazy.
One hundred.

630
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:38,760
One hundred floors and chicken.

631
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,370
That noise

632
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,140
around that is placed on.
Right,

633
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,910
but that's like taking an organism and 
using it as cells in a battery.

634
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,953
It really is.
It's like you're taking like these 

635
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,354
chickens and you're literally 
compartmentalizing it into a specific 

636
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,044
size,
like a cell and the Mitochondria of the 

637
00:29:58,151 --> 00:29:58,984
cell is this chicken and you've got 
hundreds and hundreds of them stacked 

638
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:05,720
into this place and they're like these 
living organisms that you've.

639
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,573
You've got locked into these clearly 
defined spaces and you're extracting 

640
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:14,080
energy from those chickens you're 
taking.

641
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:16,510
You're extracting food from them.
Yeah,

642
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,490
they're just protein.
They're protein bars.

643
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,210
Yeah,
I mean it is fucking bizarre.

644
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,770
It's a bizarre practice.

645
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,860
Wow.
Even when they're not in cages,

646
00:30:26,861 --> 00:30:31,840
they have them so smushed together,
they can't even fucking move.

647
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,990
Yeah.
It's not fun.

648
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,063
They're not having a good time,
but it's not the only way to raise 

649
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:38,930
chickens.
That's the problem.

650
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,823
I had this guy,
Joel Salitan on the podcast a while 

651
00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:42,350
back,
really,

652
00:30:42,351 --> 00:30:47,351
really interesting guy and he runs,
I think it's farm's called polyface.

653
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,110
Polyface farm.
Um,

654
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,113
but he's into.
He's got these things that he does with 

655
00:30:55,431 --> 00:30:58,760
these chickens where he puts them in 
these giant like chicken houses that are

656
00:30:58,761 --> 00:31:02,510
on wheels and they're like,
roll them into an area and then you just

657
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:04,940
let them out and they run around at the 
end of the day,

658
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,460
they go right back in because that's 
where they do.

659
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:08,294
They go into their nest again,
then you roll them down a hill to 

660
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:11,720
another place and then he has these 
pigs,

661
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,240
they takes pigs and he puts a fence 
around the pigs,

662
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:15,074
a movable fence and the pigs just stay 
inside that fence and eat whatever the 

663
00:31:17,781 --> 00:31:18,614
fuck they want.
And then the next day they moved the 

664
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,940
fence and they keep doing it.
So he's got these animals like that,

665
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:26,560
those chickens in like fucking chickens 
don't freak out,

666
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:27,683
don't freak out when he comes near them.
And this guy is like the prime example 

667
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,950
of what you would think of as like an 
intelligent,

668
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:42,770
an intelligent take on ethical farming 
practices because that's,

669
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,630
I think when

670
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,910
purdue and a lot of these houses buy 
from you,

671
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:49,180
you have to use their cages in their 
feet.

672
00:31:49,181 --> 00:31:51,340
And they're,
it's a franchise like Mcdonald's,

673
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:52,174
like when you raise,
when you raise livestock for a lot of 

674
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:56,200
these,
you know,

675
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,460
agro,
these,

676
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:58,480
what'd he call it?
A,

677
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,680
um,
big agro.

678
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,910
It's specific.
They wanted done a certain way.

679
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,500
And if you don't,
they don't buy from you.

680
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,473
Oh,
it's very hard to be independent like 

681
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:08,104
that.

682
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:08,810
So.
Oh,

683
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,900
that's interesting.
So like if you're a poultry grower,

684
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,760
you,
uh,

685
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:17,450
like if you want to work for purdue,
you like grow chickens for them.

686
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:18,190
They don't,
you don't,

687
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,550
you don't think they grow their own 
chickens?

688
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:20,384
Like,
how's that work?

689
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,520
No,
I think you get a contract with them and

690
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:24,200
they,
they come in and buy your stuff,

691
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:26,970
but it's all got to be done.
As I say,

692
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:31,971
Tyson track poultry farming.
Read that out there with Gregory Tyson

693
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,530
foods is one of the leading supporters 
of American agriculture,

694
00:32:35,531 --> 00:32:36,364
paying more than $15,
billion annually to independent farmers 

695
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,780
supply us with cattle,
hogs and chickens.

696
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,770
We depend on more than 11,000
independent farmers across the country.

697
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,633
This includes more than 4,000
poultry farmers who contact us to raise 

698
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,840
chickens.
Now

699
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,880
that's.
That's their website.

700
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,720
It's a.
it's a.

701
00:32:55,721 --> 00:32:56,554
it's all done with a lot of leverage and
you have to do things exactly the way 

702
00:32:59,851 --> 00:33:01,320
they want you to.
I think.

703
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:02,154
I think it was.
Was it food inc or something that did a 

704
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:05,580
documentary about it?

705
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,810
I was watching this documentary today 
that was on dig A.

706
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,073
I found it.
It was about this guy who was like this 

707
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,653
super bad ass Sushi chef in Japan,
like the best Sushi chef in Tokyo right 

708
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,620
now.
I guess they were saying and it's really

709
00:33:21,621 --> 00:33:23,540
interesting like watching this guy 
acquire the,

710
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,720
the fish and how it talks about how he 
ages to fish.

711
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:27,823
Like I didn't know that.
Did you know that when they catch tuna 

712
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,420
they'll often age them for five days and
then.

713
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,313
Yeah.
And then they age a lot of times at the 

714
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:35,744
fish market before he takes it or he 
takes it back and he'll agent another 

715
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,700
five days more.
So they might,

716
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:41,534
you know,
they might keep shit for like two weeks 

717
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:44,600
before you eat it to make it more 
tender.

718
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,520
Wow.
He's doing that with tuna.

719
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,590
Yeah.
I was watching this and I was like,

720
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:49,424
wow,
this is jamie and I were talking about 

721
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:51,140
it.

722
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,320
We were like,
Whoa,

723
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,220
what are they going to do when they kill
all the fish?

724
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,380
Like how long does it take to grow a 
fucking tune of that big.

725
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:58,214
This guy has his tune it right.
And there's sawing it with a giant Paul 

726
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,173
Bunyan saw him.
It's a fucking huge to the video is 

727
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,574
really cool.
And the people who made the video or 

728
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:08,264
like obvious like serious Sushi dorks.
So they're like super amped up to be 

729
00:34:11,931 --> 00:34:15,800
getting some Sushi from this dude,
but all I could think of is like,

730
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,600
how many fish are there?
Like,

731
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:18,434
how many days can we do?
Like everyday they're knocking them out 

732
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:22,520
of the AH,
the ocean.

733
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,050
Yeah.
Every day.

734
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,700
And there used to be areas where they,
uh,

735
00:34:27,701 --> 00:34:30,370
they restricted how much fishing went on
and now it's like,

736
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,690
it's a free for all.

737
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,233
Well,
under Donald Trump we're going to fix 

738
00:34:34,501 --> 00:34:35,334
all this.

739
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:40,660
Thank God I've been,
I've been pulled for trump's.

740
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,530
I was a little kid.
Just the concept of trump.

741
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:44,364
I've always been really into.
I like when I remember studying the 

742
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,620
constitution as a kid and thinking this 
is fucking bullshit.

743
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:50,903
We need a guy who's got some balls,
who's going to come in and get around 

744
00:34:53,971 --> 00:34:58,140
all this fucking liberal bullshit.
I'm just kidding.

745
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,970
I think of the apocalypse is upon us.
I really think it's over.

746
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,340
I mean,
he hasn't even taken office yet and he's

747
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:08,730
already alienated China.
He thinks he's friends.

748
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,010
The best part is he thinks he's friends 
with Russia.

749
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,383
That's like,
that's like hanging out with the school 

750
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:14,544
bully.
And thinking you're safe until one day 

751
00:35:16,141 --> 00:35:16,974
you say something that bully doesn't 
like any fucking cracks in the face and 

752
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,080
you realize he's just a broken child.

753
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,143
How much you know way more about this 
than I do because I've spent the 

754
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:28,194
majority of my adult life ignoring 
almost everything about how the system 

755
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:32,244
works and you win.
But how much power does he really have 

756
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,580
it president?
Yeah.

757
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,820
How much power does he really have in 
terms of decisions to be made for things

758
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:46,500
like,
like any sort of a military action?

759
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,390
Well,
what you've already seen is,

760
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:49,224
but by taking a phone call from Taiwan,
a simple act that he didn't think twice 

761
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:54,684
about that opened up the floodgates to 
China saying that we are recognizing 

762
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,280
Taiwan is an independent state,
which has been a.

763
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:05,790
there's been a one,
a one China policy going back to Nixon,

764
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:10,500
which basically ensured that it put a 
clamp down on the cold war and it said,

765
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,334
we're not going to keep.
We're not going to keep building up 

766
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:13,794
against each other.
And a part of that is we're going to 

767
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,424
live by certain doctrines like the one 
China policy and when he takes a call 

768
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:23,610
from Taiwan,
something as simple as that.

769
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,743
All of a sudden,
China is talking about a nuclear 

770
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,600
buildup.
It's that simple.

771
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,793
It's not about what laws he enacts,
it's about him as a spokesman for our 

772
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:34,920
country.
And what messages he sends out.

773
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,530
I mean,
it's like Obama did with Israel.

774
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,270
I don't know what.
I don't know why,

775
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:40,643
but in his 11th hour he is soured 
relations with Israel to the point 

776
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:44,700
where,
you know,

777
00:36:44,701 --> 00:36:45,534
um,
even though he's a lame duck president 

778
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,570
on his way out,
it's,

779
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:52,560
it was a destructive thing.
He did.

780
00:36:52,561 --> 00:36:54,390
I don't just,
I don't know if I disagree with it.

781
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,520
What did he do?
Well,

782
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,300
the UN had a resolution.
I was saying that the,

783
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,230
um,
Israel has new developments in the,

784
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,123
in the West Bank and which are illegal 
according to UN previously UN 

785
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:09,570
resolutions.
And so,

786
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,190
uh,
I dunno what they're calling it,

787
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,760
but it's illegal what they've done.
And,

788
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:16,770
and the US signed,
they signed onto it.

789
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,143
So they,
they set up these settlements in 

790
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,280
Palestinian territories,
what it is,

791
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,143
well the disputed Palestinian territory 
and they just decided to start building 

792
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,710
their,
they've been doing,

793
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:31,470
they've been building there for years 
and they put it,

794
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:35,400
they put up like 600 homes,
but they're planning on putting up 5,000

795
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,620
in an area that,
you know,

796
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,360
pieces the,
the,

797
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,790
the,
there is no peace over there.

798
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:45,930
But what's keeping it from being an all 
out war is that area that is,

799
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,660
that is supposed to be kept neutral for 
now or,

800
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,640
and now they're building on it.

801
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,390
Why would someone want to build?
Are they running out of land?

802
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,430
They can't build other places?

803
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,383
No,
they,

804
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,110
they don't recognize uh,
the Palestinians.

805
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,973
And so they don't,
they see that that's all their land 

806
00:38:04,811 --> 00:38:06,610
still.
And so they,

807
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,473
they won't stop.
They will continue building and pushing 

808
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:12,580
out.
I mean the tide is turned on Israel from

809
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,414
what I can tell.
And I don't follow Israel very closely 

810
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:15,694
at all except for when I hear people 
yelling about it at parties that I met 

811
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,713
because I have friends that are like 
hardcore Zionists and I have friends 

812
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:26,560
that are hardcore anti Zionist and I,
they're totally rational people and they

813
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:30,050
can joke around about talking about 
fucking your mother and Blah,

814
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:32,140
Blah Blah.
But as soon as Israel comes up,

815
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,170
shit gets real.
And they talk,

816
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,690
you know?
Um,

817
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,643
I think the tide is turned.
There's a lot more people that are 

818
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,210
seeing Israel as a terrorist state.

819
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:44,723
Whoa.

820
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,450
Wow.
They're very aggressive net and yahoo is

821
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:52,370
just a fucking.
He's a bowl.

822
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,540
What's the right resolution?
What's the right solution?

823
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:00,220
Because what,
how much is in dispute?

824
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:03,300
Like how much territory?
I don't know.

825
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,540
That seems like a small place doesn't.
It seemed very small.

826
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,870
Isn't Israel like the size of 
Connecticut or some shit like that.

827
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:11,760
Like how big is it?
I don't think it's very big,

828
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:16,350
but it's where it's located.
So let's find out how big is Israel?

829
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:22,090
Just a hotly charged subject?
Yeah,

830
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:22,924
it is.
It's one of the most charged subjects 

831
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:30,020
and all of the Holocaust survivors 
basically.

832
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

833
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,813
And you're talking about people that are
right next to each other with opposing 

834
00:39:35,251 --> 00:39:40,251
ideologies and various reasons for being
righteous or villain and Iran.

835
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,600
Iran looking at Israel erected that.
I said it right,

836
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:49,560
right.
Is it Iran?

837
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,783
Iran.
Yeah.

838
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,843
I was saying that they don't have a 
right to exist and that they're gonna 

839
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,250
throw a nuclear bomb over there.

840
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,863
What did you see?
That was the guy from Pakistan who 

841
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:01,230
wasn't Jamie that,
uh,

842
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,500
got duped by a fake news story.
Jamie Masada.

843
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,020
No,
not that guy by the.

844
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,110
Oh yeah,
I did see that in the guy got.

845
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,783
He got duped by fake news story and you 
said some inflammatory shit about 

846
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:17,580
causing a war and all of a sudden it's 
like,

847
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,414
Whoa,
you guys got got all up in arms about a 

848
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,130
fake story.
Yeah.

849
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,600
Like,
what in the fuck is going on?

850
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,750
What do you think was the first fake 
news story?

851
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:30,030
Because you go back to,
you know,

852
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,710
I'm thinking that it was an old fake 
news story was a

853
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,163
fake news stories.
And I think probably been around for a 

854
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:45,970
long time.
Well the Bible was a giant fake news,

855
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,510
dare you.
They did their best.

856
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,620
They did their best to remember the 
stories.

857
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,060
Find a good map.
I think part of the provinces,

858
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,380
the arguments over the maps and.
Oh I see.

859
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:00,101
Right,
right,

860
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:03,370
right.
This was the one I have.

861
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,310
Does it say like,
I just want to know,

862
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:08,500
like I'm too stupid to know what that 
is.

863
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:13,590
So why don't you ask,
ask Google compared to a state like,

864
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,510
because I think there was a,
there's a simple comparison.

865
00:41:16,511 --> 00:41:17,344
I just don't remember what it is.
It's like Connecticut or something like 

866
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:20,014
that.
Or maybe Massachusetts size comparison 

867
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:27,784
map Israel in USA anyway.
What were we just telling you with a 

868
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,230
size comparison and fake news?
Yeah,

869
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,290
very good.
New Jersey.

870
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,030
Okay.
Yeah.

871
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,043
So it's basically the size of New Jersey
and New Jersey is building a lot of 

872
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:43,544
homes.
It looks a little bit bigger than New 

873
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,453
Jersey.

874
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:49,920
But look at that.
It barely fits in Lake Michigan.

875
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,460
You can stick Israel in Lake Michigan.
What the fuck?

876
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,820
How big is Lake Michigan?
Holy Shit.

877
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,560
Yeah.
Isn't that insane?

878
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,820
I know a giant ocean of water that you 
can surf on Lake Michigan.

879
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,910
What's the one that's near Chicago?
Lake Michigan.

880
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,890
Lake Michigan.
Um,

881
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:12,190
I stayed at girl and when she was a kid 
her,

882
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,310
you dated her when she was a kid?
No,

883
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:18,130
dude,
a story she told when she was a dare you

884
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,520
when she was a kid,
she was in a,

885
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:22,354
uh,
a storm on Lake Michigan where they had 

886
00:42:25,661 --> 00:42:28,300
to turn into the,
into the waves,

887
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:30,310
like over and over and over again all 
night.

888
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,100
They were not safe like they were in 
danger,

889
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:36,040
being capsized by the waves on a fucking
lake.

890
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,920
It's amazing.
And I think it was her stepdad.

891
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,840
I forgot who,
who's steering the boat,

892
00:42:40,841 --> 00:42:44,140
but was just wrecked by the end of the 
day.

893
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,580
Like his arms were falling off.
Like he,

894
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,820
he barely could use his arms because he,
like,

895
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:51,190
he had to keep turning the boat all 
night long.

896
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,890
They had to strap everyone down to the 
boat on a,

897
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,660
on a fucking lake.
Yeah.

898
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,340
On a lake.
Not the ocean.

899
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,200
Yeah.
I don't care where you put a boat in,

900
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,300
you got what you got.
Whatever's coming to you.

901
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,180
Is that Lake Michigan?
Oh my God.

902
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:06,670
Look at the waves by foot waves on Lake 
Michigan.

903
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:11,530
It says 25 foot waves on land.
That's so crazy.

904
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,320
Well,
let's all that wind that comes in.

905
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,430
It's just an immense puddle.
Yeah.

906
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,160
That used to be a fucking glacier

907
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,313
glaciers that are in some places as high
as two miles high and they became all 

908
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:31,470
that stuff.
It's nuts.

909
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:33,720
Mad.
I have a buddy of mine lives,

910
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:34,860
uh,
in Wisconsin,

911
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:37,110
in the driftless area.
It's like the area where the,

912
00:43:37,111 --> 00:43:38,520
uh,
glaciers didn't hit.

913
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,330
It's really kind of cool because it's 
all these hills and crazy,

914
00:43:42,331 --> 00:43:45,240
like a beautiful typography.
The rest of the place,

915
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,190
like a,
an eraser came along.

916
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:48,043
It just flattened that motherfucker out 
just from the weight of the glacier is 

917
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:51,624
pushing down on the land,
the glacier just pushing for and 

918
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,810
crushing everything in its path.
Literally like God's eraser.

919
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,673
And that's when the wind whips up 
because there's nothing stopping that 

920
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:01,710
wind.
Nothing.

921
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,260
I mean,
I remember driving through,

922
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,373
I think it was North Dakota,
it was North Dakota and I was driving 

923
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:08,034
from I think Iowa or Nebraska and North 
Dakota is doing a college gig and the 

924
00:44:13,561 --> 00:44:18,000
Gig was at night and it was like a good 
four hour drive and they told me,

925
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:19,950
look,
this is a single lane road.

926
00:44:19,951 --> 00:44:22,950
The only,
it's the only way there and it's flat as

927
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:23,784
shit and it's windy out so be careful.
So I'm in my rent a car and a snow snow 

928
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,160
starts as I'm and the snow

929
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,140
is just going just vertically across the
road and it starts to build up.

930
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,013
It starts to build up the snow on the 
road and all of a sudden I'm like 

931
00:44:40,531 --> 00:44:44,250
halfway there and it's fucking white out
conditions.

932
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:49,200
All I can see is the light,
the snow in my headlights ahead of me.

933
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,930
And for a long time I was just looking 
at that,

934
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:56,430
looking at the line on the road and 
following that line disappeared.

935
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,030
Oh Shit.
And I fucking freak out.

936
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,864
And so I just pull what I think is to 
the side of the road because I don't 

937
00:45:04,781 --> 00:45:05,614
know where I'm driving and I wait and 
all of a sudden I see headlights coming 

938
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:12,390
from behind me,
fucking 18 wheeler barreling down,

939
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,703
hopefully hope and he sees me.
He passes me and I immediately get 

940
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,504
behind him and I rode that motherfucker 
for two hours to get to the school 

941
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,670
shaking,
fucking shaken.

942
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,000
And I got to the Gig and it was like 
these kids,

943
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,600
it was like fucking Jesus Christ has 
shown up in their town.

944
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,463
They were like,

945
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,520
this is our only entertainment all year.

946
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,673
And so we did a.
We did a show in so many people came 

947
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:47,644
that they added a second shell,
but half the kids stayed for the second 

948
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:51,784
show.
So it was definitely one of those year 

949
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:55,060
material got told that night.
Joe Rogan,

950
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,050
I guarantee you that your is Don Gavin,
Steve Sweeney.

951
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,340
Todd Parker's fucking ripping every joke
out of my ass.

952
00:46:03,341 --> 00:46:07,840
I can think of that second step.
They paid me devil hilarious.

953
00:46:07,841 --> 00:46:09,790
And I couldn't get out of there for two 
days afterwards.

954
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,660
We were,
yeah.

955
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,000
Oh my God,

956
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:14,903
yeah.
There was so much uncertainty in the 

957
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:17,104
winters in Boston.
There was like you weren't certain if 

958
00:46:19,661 --> 00:46:21,240
you were going to get home.
Yeah.

959
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,233
Like I think that's right.
I think that's important for people to 

960
00:46:25,031 --> 00:46:27,340
understand that don't live in a place 
like that.

961
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,293
Like if you got hit with a big January 
snow storm and it hit while you were at 

962
00:46:33,221 --> 00:46:34,660
work,
if you've got to work,

963
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:35,291
do you.
First of all,

964
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:37,390
there'd be warnings everywhere.
They'd be worn.

965
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:39,980
They'd cancel school before the first 
fucking drop up.

966
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,840
Snow fell right there.
Don't freak out about like big blizzard.

967
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,620
But if a big one hit and you fucked up 
and you weren't paying attention,

968
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,990
you could get stuck wherever the fuck 
you are.

969
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,390
Yeah.
Highways just stopped for days.

970
00:46:52,391 --> 00:46:53,224
Yep.

971
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,103
It takes forever for them to chew all 
that snow way and if it stays cold in 

972
00:46:58,161 --> 00:47:01,070
Boston it will stay cold for a long 
fucking time.

973
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:01,904
We remember those black piles of ice ice
that had just gotten road grime and 

974
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:09,530
exhaust on it,
but it was too cold for it to melt,

975
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,980
so we just push that shit to the side.
It would narrow the fucking highway.

976
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:13,880
Yeah,
right.

977
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:15,770
Yeah.
They'd get out there with those,

978
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:16,604
uh,
those trucks throwing the salt and the 

979
00:47:18,231 --> 00:47:20,720
sand down.
I mean they be out there before the snow

980
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,070
had started.
They were laying down.

981
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:22,810
Salt

982
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,940
did.
That was why if you've got an old car,

983
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,480
you wanted to get a California car where
they didn't,

984
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,300
they didn't use salt on the.
If you've got an old car in Boston,

985
00:47:31,301 --> 00:47:32,134
the fucking fenders were all rotted out.
Everything rotted it out because of all 

986
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:37,260
that salt.
And they constantly re up the,

987
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:38,290
uh,
the highways.

988
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,670
Oh yeah,
that's right.

989
00:47:39,671 --> 00:47:40,504
It's just chewing through it.
But isn't that kind of the only way to 

990
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:45,670
ensure that shit's gonna Melt?
You kinda have to salt.

991
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,650
Yup.
Salt it and say.

992
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:49,510
I think they sand it more than they salt
it now.

993
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:51,750
They probably are,
you know where they get this?

994
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,710
They get the salt from like on these 
giant fucking barges from South America.

995
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,510
Salt wars,
like the old days.

996
00:47:58,600 --> 00:47:59,590
Is that right?
No,

997
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,760
but imagine they used to go to war for 
salt.

998
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,220
How you mean like way,
way back salt.

999
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:10,600
It's amazing that we give it away for 
free because if you really think of what

1000
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:13,060
it was worth like five,
600 years ago,

1001
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,700
it was incredibly valuable.
Right?

1002
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,320
Why?
Because food was so bland.

1003
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:19,490
No To preserve food.
Uh,

1004
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,000
they didn't have refrigeration,
so like their meat,

1005
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,220
if you cover the outside of it with 
salt,

1006
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:28,420
the bacteria can eat the meat and it 
slows the decaying process.

1007
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,440
You could dry things out and salt them 
and as a way to preserve food,

1008
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,380
like an important way to preserve food.
I think,

1009
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:36,923
you know,
I don't know how long you get to have a 

1010
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:39,064
piece of meat and just cover it with 
salt and leave it laying around at room 

1011
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:41,884
temperature,
but I think it's a lot more than it 

1012
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,900
would if you didn't have the salt.
And I think,

1013
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:49,930
uh,
it's one of the reasons why it was.

1014
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,793
I mean it was one of the most valuable 
things in the world at one point in 

1015
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,374
time,
which is crazy now when you think about 

1016
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:56,280
it.
Yeah.

1017
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,860
And everything you ate must've had salty
a shit.

1018
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,620
People must just get used to that.
Taste is salt.

1019
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,653
Do you remember when everybody was 
thinking that salt causes high blood 

1020
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:10,770
pressure and then it doesn't?
Oh No,

1021
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,880
it's a mineral.
Yeah.

1022
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:14,110
I mean it's like you're not supposed to 
have too much of it,

1023
00:49:14,111 --> 00:49:17,800
but like that's not what's wrong.
Like what else is going on?

1024
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:20,380
And then there was this study that came 
out recently,

1025
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:25,240
a paper that came out recently that was 
pointing to the sugar industry,

1026
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:30,020
accepting bribes or giving bribes to 
scientists in the 1950.

1027
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,213
Just do that to,
to push the blame away from sugar and 

1028
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,253
saturated fat.
The amount of heart disease that it 

1029
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:39,400
causes,
no sugar is.

1030
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,460
It has become the new salt.
It's become the new cholesterol.

1031
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:46,120
It's become the new everything.
It's everybody's saying is fear.

1032
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,590
Yeah.
It's everybody's fear now.

1033
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,933
Wha Wha.
How do salt and sugar prevent microbial 

1034
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,900
spoilage says they use sugar and salt.
That's the name way to Cerner to.

1035
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:00,430
Hmm.
Interesting.

1036
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,240
Well,
it tastes better that way probably.

1037
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,790
Yeah.
Okay,

1038
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:08,200
so it says protection of foods from 
microbial spoilage,

1039
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:11,020
using salt,
usually sodium chloride or sugar.

1040
00:50:11,021 --> 00:50:15,850
Usually sucrose has ancient roots and is
often referred to assaulting salt.

1041
00:50:15,851 --> 00:50:16,684
Curing corning or sugar curing pieces of
rock salt used for curing are sometimes 

1042
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,860
called corns,
hence the name.

1043
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:26,980
Corned beef was wonder why they call it 
the corned.

1044
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,560
No Shit.

1045
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:32,810
That's what it does.
Fascinating.

1046
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,980
Okay.
Where's it shut?

1047
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,320
I'm sorry.
What does it say?

1048
00:50:36,321 --> 00:50:37,960
Where it goes several ways here.
Oh,

1049
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:38,953
okay.
There's several ways in which salt and 

1050
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:41,174
sugar inhibit microbial growth.
Most notable is simple osmosis or 

1051
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:47,510
dehydration,
salt or sugar,

1052
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,793
whether in solid or equias form.
Attempts to reach equilibrium with the 

1053
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:58,211
salt or sugar content of the food 
product with which it is in contact.

1054
00:50:58,401 --> 00:50:59,234
This has the effect of drawing available
water from within the food to the 

1055
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:06,200
outside and inserting salt or sugar 
molecules into the food interior.

1056
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:12,010
The result is a reduction of the so 
called water activity measure of unbound

1057
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:14,504
free water molecules in the food that is
necessary for microbial survival and 

1058
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:21,290
growth.
That is fucking fast.

1059
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:21,891
Yeah,
it is.

1060
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:25,670
I never thought about how because I was 
think about when I put salt on my food.

1061
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:26,863
It seems like,
especially with seesaw where they would 

1062
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:28,874
sit there so big,
the particles that you don't just get 

1063
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:33,410
like that,
it doesn't spread,

1064
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:34,244
but they would eat the food,
like say you put it in your mashed 

1065
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:37,000
potatoes,
right?

1066
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,203
It spreads really evenly throughout the 
mashed potatoes that it realizes all 

1067
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:41,624
that chemical reactions going on between
all the cells in the potatoes and the 

1068
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:46,664
salt.
It's kind.

1069
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,340
It's flowing back and forth.
Yeah.

1070
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,760
Yeah.
I mean think about how difficult it must

1071
00:51:54,761 --> 00:51:59,390
have been to get fresh food to a city in
1700.

1072
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:02,603
Throwing salt on everything and packing 
things in salt and taking them down the 

1073
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:09,360
road on the back of wagons,
being pulled by horses

1074
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:10,283
with Ms Dot added control mosquitoes and
flies on everything that was for so 

1075
00:52:16,571 --> 00:52:19,990
long.
How people lived for so long.

1076
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,853
Open wagons,
there was no like air tight 

1077
00:52:23,441 --> 00:52:25,480
compartments.
No,

1078
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,480
I mean I bet kings that's a pretty dope 
compartments.

1079
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:28,870
Yeah.

1080
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:32,120
Like in game of thrones,
those like sitting there like just chill

1081
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:32,954
and how long is this ride?
The horses are pulling the wagon along 

1082
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,130
that fan themselves and shit that hadn't
happened to.

1083
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,800
It was like the real pimps,
like if you were a dude,

1084
00:52:41,801 --> 00:52:45,280
you could pick a checkup and take her to
the back of the the carriage.

1085
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:46,660
She'd be like,
Oh my God.

1086
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:48,030
You have your own character?
Yeah.

1087
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,590
Yeah.
Baby carriage.

1088
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,520
And you have hepatitis this.
Did they have hepatitis back then?

1089
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,070
Was Him the first VD came into play?

1090
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,563
Well,
syphilis was probably the first one I 

1091
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,740
read about it in the Bible.
Really?

1092
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,570
Yeah.
Syphilis was all over the place.

1093
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,093
I think,
uh,

1094
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,330
you know,
they call it.

1095
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,740
I think they call it syphilis.
Really,

1096
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,830
didn't I?
I'm looking at the clap,

1097
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,430
I think.
I think syphilis is the clap.

1098
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:18,430
Like how do you think that?
Do you think that happens in animals?

1099
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:19,860
Do you think animals give each other.
Okay.

1100
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,530
I haven't thought about that.
My friends got a herpes blister,

1101
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,160
but it busts

1102
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,010
out like every couple months.
She just showed me this morning,

1103
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:30,300
come on,
give me a kiss.

1104
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,940
Things the size of a dime.
Was it on her lip?

1105
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,200
Yeah,
I used to get those.

1106
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,330
It's such a shame because she's 
beautiful.

1107
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,970
She changed her diet.
Is that Koalas have chlamydia or do they

1108
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:41,610
are known for having.

1109
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,391
What do you.
Why do you say it?

1110
00:53:42,391 --> 00:53:46,980
Looking at me like it doesn't count if 
it's a stuffed animal.

1111
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,060
No,
no.

1112
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,090
They all have it,
but it's like a.

1113
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,510
it's a thing I thought I heard like they
spread stds.

1114
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:57,463
Well,
it looks good.

1115
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,950
Article Says Koala,

1116
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:02,220
chlamydia,
the std threatening and Australian icon.

1117
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,190
Didn't aids come from a monkey or is 
that A.

1118
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,353
is that a myth that man,
I wish I could remember exactly how to 

1119
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:14,910
answer this because I listened to a 
radio lab podcast called patient zero,

1120
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:16,980
I think it was.
That was all about this.

1121
00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:20,610
They were trying to figure out who was 
the first person that contracted the HIV

1122
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:21,444
virus and it did have something to do 
with someone who was tending to meet 

1123
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:33,530
that he had killed of a chimpanzee and 
maybe perhaps had an open cut.

1124
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,650
Yeah.
That was one of the speculations,

1125
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,870
which of course turned into somebody 
fucked up monkey.

1126
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,680
That's just the American translation of 
facts.

1127
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:47,550
It's fucking natural one with people.
Awesome dude.

1128
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,130
Fuck the monkey.
How else do you get an std?

1129
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:50,964
From a monkey,
you gotta fucking see that Chappelle 

1130
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:53,790
bit.
Yeah.

1131
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:54,683
Oh my gosh.
Chappelle had one of the funniest bits 

1132
00:54:56,281 --> 00:54:57,180
of all time.
He goes,

1133
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,300
do you know how hard it would be to fuck
a monkey?

1134
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:03,780
Once he said it,
I was like,

1135
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,030
I never even thought of that.
Imagine the battle right there.

1136
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:10,620
You would have to go through to actually
fuck a monkey.

1137
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:11,440
Yeah.

1138
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,480
How do you just think it's a given?
Like,

1139
00:55:13,481 --> 00:55:13,901
you know,
hey,

1140
00:55:13,901 --> 00:55:15,610
I'm going to have some dry days.
I'll go,

1141
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:16,630
fuck a monkey,
dude.

1142
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,730
Not so easy.
Yeah.

1143
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,860
I've.
I do a bit of my act.

1144
00:55:20,861 --> 00:55:25,000
That's true about my cat biting me in 
the hand and me getting pissed at him.

1145
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:26,200
I'm like,
what the fuck dude?

1146
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:29,320
And he's looking at me and his ears are 
pulled back.

1147
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:35,390
Like that's a cat is.
That's a fucking powerful little animal,

1148
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,173
but it's nothing compared to a monkey.
Monkeys throw themselves through the 

1149
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:41,050
air.
Oh yeah.

1150
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,800
Little tiny body swings itself to the or
catches itself,

1151
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:45,663
throws his to the lab.
They can do ridiculous shit with their 

1152
00:55:48,701 --> 00:55:51,370
bodies and you got to think they get a 
hold of you.

1153
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,370
If that thing bites your face,
if it gets a hold of your neck,

1154
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,680
it might look a little,
you know,

1155
00:55:56,681 --> 00:55:59,130
especially if it's a champ,
like oh,

1156
00:55:59,131 --> 00:55:59,964
like a little baby champ we had on the 
set of news radio and it was like a two 

1157
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:06,520
year old chimp and this thing slapped me
in my back.

1158
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:07,683
Like dude,
it Kinda like when you let them climb 

1159
00:56:10,421 --> 00:56:11,254
on,
you kind of does whatever he wants 

1160
00:56:11,861 --> 00:56:13,690
because he's a baby.
He wasn't trying to hurt me,

1161
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,040
but first of all he felt like he was 
made out of corrugated,

1162
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,280
would just like,
it was like a wooden animal,

1163
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,020
like his.
He might've been like this,

1164
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,010
like you could kind

1165
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,160
of pick them up and carry him,
but he felt like nothing,

1166
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:27,994
like a person feels like nothing.
It was just solid muscle and he just 

1167
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:33,503
slapped me on the back and all I could 
think of is like a big one of these 

1168
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:38,203
appeal,
full grown one of these things and they 

1169
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:43,230
get a great shit around people.
When we were down in A.

1170
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,083
we're in South Africa and Cape Town and 
we were taking a walk down to the Cape 

1171
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:49,990
of good,
no Cape of whatever at the tip,

1172
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:50,824
the very tip of South Africa and is a 
field that you walked through with the 

1173
00:56:54,191 --> 00:56:55,024
path and the deranged is came up to us 
and my son was about maybe about three 

1174
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:01,780
years old and they said to us,
yeah,

1175
00:57:01,781 --> 00:57:02,531
you're gonna.
You're gonna.

1176
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:04,810
Want to hold him the whole time?
And we're like,

1177
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:05,860
why?
They're like chimps.

1178
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,130
Chimps will take them.
They'll just come down and grab them.

1179
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,390
Yeah.
They'll steal your kid and he.

1180
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:11,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

1181
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,960
That's real.
Can you imagine that?

1182
00:57:13,961 --> 00:57:18,370
You go on a trip with your kid,
he come back with no kid and you watched

1183
00:57:18,371 --> 00:57:19,260
your kid get taken.

1184
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,840
Fuck,
fuck.

1185
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,180
Where's your son?
Baboons to there.

1186
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:26,830
Another animal will do the same thing.
Yeah.

1187
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:27,903
They'll go after it.
You know what I might be thinking of 

1188
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:30,070
baboons.
Oh,

1189
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,490
that makes more.
I think it was bare bones.

1190
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,383
It makes more sense,
but there have been stories of chimps 

1191
00:57:34,841 --> 00:57:35,980
doing it too.
Yeah.

1192
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:37,090
Look,
man.

1193
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:37,691
Well,
who's the woman?

1194
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:40,600
I got a face bitten off by a chance of 
people,

1195
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,630
but the one woman who was a most 
recently,

1196
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:44,583
her friend had this pet chimp and she 
was given xanax and wine and maybe 

1197
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:53,050
sucking stuff.
Why did he xanax?

1198
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,180
If if she's sucking his Dick,
what the hell's he need?

1199
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,340
Could you imagine being so fucking crazy
then?

1200
00:57:58,341 --> 00:58:02,350
Not only do you have a 200 pound ship 
living with Xanax?

1201
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:07,660
Do you think she gave it the Xanax so 
that he'd be more pliable?

1202
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,970
I think she was just banging this 
monkey.

1203
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,130
I think she live with this monkey and 
she was banging it.

1204
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:13,323
I really,
really think that because I shouldn't 

1205
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:15,760
say monkey.
It's a champ.

1206
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:16,603
Whatever.
She was living with this chimp and 

1207
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:21,940
banging it and so her friend came over.
There was a chip.

1208
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,400
Chip used to dress up.
That's inhuman.

1209
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,740
He was fucking late.
Yep.

1210
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,830
That was the lady.
No Way.

1211
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:31,480
That was his girlfriend man.
Who Do you think initiated?

1212
00:58:31,481 --> 00:58:35,710
The first time she got a pet chimp.
She raised it.

1213
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,480
It's a boy.
It's got a dick.

1214
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,493
She's like,
look,

1215
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,723
this is my new body guard,
and she's got this chip and she has a 

1216
00:58:41,861 --> 00:58:43,680
couple of glasses of red wine that 
shipped,

1217
00:58:43,681 --> 00:58:44,710
wants a fucker.
He's,

1218
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,593
she's like,
who?

1219
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,473
Who's gonna know,
she lets that chimp fucker a couple 

1220
00:58:48,551 --> 00:58:49,384
times and then he keeps swinging dick or
way and that's his girlfriend now and 

1221
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:56,170
this lady came over and she interrupted 
his fun time.

1222
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:58,930
She was,
she was cock blocking and he didn't take

1223
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:02,200
too kindly to it.
So he did chimps shit to her.

1224
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:03,850
Just ripped her apart.
Yeah.

1225
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,330
Tour faceoff.
They bite your fingers off.

1226
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,470
He's huge.
He was 200 pounds.

1227
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,970
Gets big.
Overfed chimpanzee.

1228
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,570
Super ridiculous.
Ungodly strong.

1229
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:18,560
No foreplay.
Oh,

1230
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,100
he wanted to fuck you got fucked.
Get fucked.

1231
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,380
You get out of the shower.
Naked bubble is going to fuck you.

1232
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,570
You have your period.
Forget it.

1233
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,180
Try to keep that chip off eye.
You're menstruating.

1234
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,283
A police officer who responded to the 
scene of the attack shot and killed 

1235
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:40,640
travis when he clawed,
opened the cops cruiser door and flashed

1236
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:43,970
his bloody teeth.
Oh my God,

1237
00:59:43,971 --> 00:59:46,460
Dude.
He opened the fucking door.

1238
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,670
The cop was shooting it as it was 
pulling the door open,

1239
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
flashing it's bloody teeth looking at,
tear him apart to holy fuck,

1240
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,463
holy fuck.
Imagine if that was you and you didn't 

1241
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:04,850
have a gun and you weren't a cop.
He just pulled up and you saw some chimp

1242
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,980
tearing apart a lady and you're like,
what the fuck?

1243
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:07,873
And the chimp just scores running 
towards you and decides he's going to 

1244
01:00:09,561 --> 01:00:13,780
open up your fucking door now.
And he's flashing his bloody teeth after

1245
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:15,410
just ate some lady's face.

1246
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,500
Fuck man.
Where was this?

1247
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:19,963
I love this part.
Investigators later speculated that a 

1248
01:00:21,801 --> 01:00:26,801
dose of Xanax caused the chimp to go 
preserve a look at that face.

1249
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,590
Looks like now.
Oh my God.

1250
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,660
Her face transplant was being rejected.
Oh my gosh.

1251
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:38,533
Surgery.
Does that mean like she's going out to 

1252
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:42,530
meet guys and she's being rejected?
No,

1253
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:43,364
her body rejects face transplants.
Any kind of transplants are notoriously 

1254
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:48,350
tricky.
Apparently.

1255
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:51,270
Poor Lady.
God said,

1256
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,910
wait,
where's it say that she was fucking him?

1257
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,340
Um,
that's mine part.

1258
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:56,540
I added the.
Oh,

1259
01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:57,980
oh,
I thought you were serious.

1260
01:00:58,420 --> 01:00:59,420
I don't know what they're doing.

1261
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,980
I mean,
it's totally plausible,

1262
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,760
it's completely plausible,
but I absolutely made it up for regarded

1263
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:09,260
as her son.
Okay.

1264
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:10,094
Maybe she didn't fuck it.
Do you think a woman could get pregnant 

1265
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:16,220
from a monkey?
Depends on the woman.

1266
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:17,790
Depends on the monkey.
Yeah.

1267
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:21,290
Some super smart monkey and really 
stupid person who knows.

1268
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,000
Yeah.
No,

1269
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:24,530
there's some hybrids,
right?

1270
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:27,050
That uh,
that wind up being viable.

1271
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:29,320
That's all like new species get 
developed sometimes,

1272
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:31,490
but most of the time it doesn't like a 
lagger,

1273
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,070
but they can't make babies.
You know,

1274
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:36,260
they can,
you can make a baby lion and a tiger can

1275
01:01:36,261 --> 01:01:39,290
breed and make a baby,
but that baby can make babies.

1276
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,500
So I wonder man,
like what was it,

1277
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,420
if you believe in evolution,
of course.

1278
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:45,853
What was it in history like?
What was it like when there was a bunch 

1279
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:50,084
of different species of humans because 
they think there's a bunch now they've 

1280
01:01:52,611 --> 01:01:56,690
documented how many have documented now 
because they keep finding new ones.

1281
01:01:56,810 --> 01:01:58,820
Like they found some new one in Russia 
recently.

1282
01:01:59,010 --> 01:01:59,541
Oh,
by the way,

1283
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:01,010
all the people that,
uh,

1284
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:05,780
that tweeted at me and sent me messages 
that have fucked up and said,

1285
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:09,500
facility Lowman Chenko is Russian.
He's actually from the Ukraine.

1286
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,980
I apologize.
I am a retarded American.

1287
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,173
Who?
Anybody who's over there in that spot 

1288
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,410
who talks like that?
I go,

1289
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:19,380
that's how the Russian dude.
Yeah,

1290
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:19,980
but

1291
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,340
that I understand that people would 
think.

1292
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,600
Doesn't that give you an out?
No,

1293
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:26,790
because I had a buddy of mine growing up
who's Ukrainian.

1294
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:30,120
He always regarded himself as Ukrainian.
He never thought of himself as Russian.

1295
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,770
So I get it.
I get it.

1296
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:34,920
It's like if we were America,
North America,

1297
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:36,660
Canada,
and in Mexico,

1298
01:02:36,661 --> 01:02:37,900
we're all just one thing.
Oh,

1299
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:39,150
you're from that spot.
No,

1300
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:39,330
no,
no.

1301
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,630
I'm from America,
motherfucker.

1302
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,970
Yeah,
I'm from this spot,

1303
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:43,290
bitch.
Well,

1304
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:45,090
as far as the cave men go.
Yeah.

1305
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:49,560
They didn't used to think that 
neanderthal man and sapient's existed at

1306
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:53,880
the same time.
Like when you look at a timeline of cave

1307
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,380
[inaudible],
they make it seem like one ended in the,

1308
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,550
one just fucking started,
like in a year,

1309
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:00,643
you know,
3000 bc all sudden they just changed 

1310
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,740
3000 BC,
20,000

1311
01:03:04,741 --> 01:03:05,574
BC.
How?

1312
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,620
I think it was a lot more than that.

1313
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:12,870
I think when they're talking about 
people living alongside Neanderthal,

1314
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:15,630
I think they're talking about like 40 or
50,000

1315
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:16,640
years ago.
Yeah.

1316
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:18,390
So there was,
like you said,

1317
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:21,120
they coexisted and they say that the 
fights,

1318
01:03:21,121 --> 01:03:24,420
because neanderthal man was a fucking 
beast.

1319
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:25,433
Totally different kind of person.
Totally different than sap and came 

1320
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:28,434
along and sapient was much smarter and 
that's the only way he was the one that 

1321
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:36,630
survived over neanderthal would show me 
that again,

1322
01:03:36,631 --> 01:03:37,464
they were able to,
they were able to out hunting out kill 

1323
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:44,190
or we fucked them all and then we 
interbreed with them.

1324
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,750
That probably might have happened to 
you.

1325
01:03:45,751 --> 01:03:46,501
What does it say,
Jamie?

1326
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:49,800
It says a guy is trying to make a hybrid
between a chimp.

1327
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,300
Nineteen,
24.

1328
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:53,550
Whoa.
Let me guess.

1329
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,600
German,
a wild group of 13 female chimpanzees to

1330
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:01,830
bring back to primary research facility.
It's a sucky me.

1331
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:05,430
The female chimpanzees were repeatedly 
injected with human male sperm,

1332
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:09,690
but none became pregnant.
It was rumored that Ivonne have used his

1333
01:04:09,691 --> 01:04:13,650
own sperm or that of his son,
but few people believe on.

1334
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:15,750
Can we come downstairs for a minute?
Well,

1335
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:19,170
where else is he going to get come?
You try to go for a hard to get come.

1336
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:24,240
He tried to get a female volunteers to 
get injected with a male chimpanzees and

1337
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:28,150
how many did it rumored that it only 
happened once,

1338
01:04:28,151 --> 01:04:33,100
but apparently he got arrested and sent 
away to work in a veterinary station and

1339
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:37,050
stand and died two years later.
But note,

1340
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,090
no pregnancy actually happened,
but maybe he actually did do it.

1341
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:40,860
Who knows?

1342
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,930
The rumor was the pregnancy actually did
happen.

1343
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:43,764
Did Not deny.

1344
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:48,280
There's a rumor that he did actually 
inject a woman with sperm.

1345
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,990
This story,
the story of this was like the beginning

1346
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:55,530
of like some crazy superhero x men type.
Yeah,

1347
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,920
we'll have some new,
some new.

1348
01:04:57,921 --> 01:04:59,120
Uh,
instead of Wolverine,

1349
01:04:59,121 --> 01:04:59,954
some man champ,
some hybrid like wolverine looked like 

1350
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:04,820
he was kind of a man champ.
Hybrid.

1351
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:06,860
Real Wolverine.
Like from the comic books,

1352
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,920
he was hairy looking half human looking 
person.

1353
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:11,023
Well,
the Nazis did all kinds of shit like 

1354
01:05:12,591 --> 01:05:13,424
that.
Yeah.

1355
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:17,980
Taking heads off one animal and trying 
to put them on other

1356
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,813
animals.

1357
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,720
But how many find this out,
Jamie?

1358
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:27,580
Find out when did human beings and the 
endo talls coexist.

1359
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:29,350
How long ago was that?
Or how about this?

1360
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:32,020
How long ago did neanderthals go 
extinct?

1361
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:37,630
Because that's what would tell us a lot.
If you had to guess,

1362
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:40,090
what are you going to get Craig?
I'd say yeah.

1363
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:41,500
20,000
sounds bonus.

1364
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:42,101
Say for.
Oh,

1365
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:42,934
I was right.
Neanderthals went extinct in Europe 

1366
01:05:44,411 --> 01:05:45,880
about 40,000
years ago.

1367
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,360
Giving them millennia to coexist with 
modern humans culturally and sexually.

1368
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:53,883
New findings suggest the research also 
suggests that modern humans did not 

1369
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,740
cause neanderthals to rapidly go 
extinct.

1370
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:04,160
As some researchers have previously 
suggested they killed the.

1371
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:05,860
Yeah.
There was a lot of people that did.

1372
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,980
There was one guy that had a crazy 
fucking theory.

1373
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:14,250
That's probably absolutely not true,
but his theory was that they didn't look

1374
01:06:15,011 --> 01:06:16,390
like people.
His theory,

1375
01:06:16,391 --> 01:06:18,880
we don't know what their soft tissue 
looked like.

1376
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,360
So his tea,
he had this idea of a really intelligent

1377
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:26,110
apelike creature because he compared 
what do you remember?

1378
01:06:26,111 --> 01:06:27,610
That whole guy,
his whole thing,

1379
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:32,180
he made like an animated video of what 
it looked like.

1380
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,590
It was terrifying,
like gorilla looking thing.

1381
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,860
It's like heavily muscled because they 
were only like five,

1382
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:43,450
two or five three,
but they were like 205 pounds with giant

1383
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:46,630
boulders,
sized bones in their body.

1384
01:06:46,631 --> 01:06:49,030
They had way different bone structure 
than we do.

1385
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,070
And they were supposed to be like 
freakishly strong.

1386
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:51,870
Yeah.

1387
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:55,170
But I think they were sorta like on all 
fours and standing upright,

1388
01:06:55,171 --> 01:06:58,440
but then really sapiens stood upright.
Is that true?

1389
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,810
I think so.
I know there was a difference in the way

1390
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:04,140
they moved that uh,
the sapiens were faster but they weren't

1391
01:07:04,141 --> 01:07:04,974
as strong.
So if they got into any kind of a 

1392
01:07:05,971 --> 01:07:07,920
battle,
they were fucking dead.

1393
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:09,890
Right?
Hmm.

1394
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,020
That's interesting.
Yes.

1395
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,630
I read sapiens.

1396
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,073
Yeah.
This is what they absolutely think that 

1397
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:19,220
they looked like the neanderthals looked
like,

1398
01:07:19,221 --> 01:07:20,054
but there was a guy had some crazy 
alternative theory that was probably 

1399
01:07:23,991 --> 01:07:28,991
horseshit that I want to focus on.
Probably totally fake,

1400
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:34,880
but it was like his theories,
like what if she would have neanderthal,

1401
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,833
didn't look anything like us.
Like what if deanna tall like had 

1402
01:07:38,570 --> 01:07:43,570
gorilla like skin and was just just 
hooking scary looking fanged up,

1403
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:47,690
you know,
jacked humanoid kind of ape.

1404
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:49,370
Yeah.
Who knows,

1405
01:07:49,371 --> 01:07:50,204
man.
There was definitely like a bunch of 

1406
01:07:51,951 --> 01:07:53,880
different kinds of people though.
They keep

1407
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,043
did more,
more and more evidence of new teeth and 

1408
01:07:57,141 --> 01:07:58,070
shit.
Right.

1409
01:07:58,071 --> 01:08:01,280
But the evolution was so slow.
Like we think about things.

1410
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:04,910
The way evolution happens for us today 
is technological.

1411
01:08:04,911 --> 01:08:07,760
So we see shit happened from decade to 
decade.

1412
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:09,300
Oh yeah.
The end.

1413
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,410
It's all profile was super predator.
So in this video,

1414
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:13,910
when you're looking at the end,
it's all,

1415
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,120
he's got like gorilla look

1416
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:16,953
and scan or these big crazy eyes and 
it's a terrifying looking beast as 

1417
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:22,214
opposed to the way we always project 
them and he bases it on like the shape 

1418
01:08:26,421 --> 01:08:31,421
of their head and like what,
what a gorilla's head longer jaw mean.

1419
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:32,733
It's crazy like you.
Cause we don't know what their soft 

1420
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:34,874
tissue looks like,
but if you give them a gorilla nose 

1421
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:40,460
instead of a human nose,
they look way fucking scarier.

1422
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,833
And his argument was like,
we have no idea what their nose look 

1423
01:08:43,351 --> 01:08:44,940
like.
Why are we giving them a human nose?

1424
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:46,583
I wonder if that flies.
I wonder if anthropologists are getting 

1425
01:08:49,371 --> 01:08:51,980
angry right now.
There were some vicious motherfucker.

1426
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:54,050
Look at the way that thing looked,
if that's what it looked like.

1427
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,410
Like what the fuck?
I know he looks up right now though.

1428
01:08:57,411 --> 01:08:59,450
I guess they were.
They were partly on all fours.

1429
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:01,640
Ended up right.
I think they were upright.

1430
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,760
I think I'm pretty sure neanderthals 
were completely upright.

1431
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:05,630
Oh No.
Yeah.

1432
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,240
Yeah.
Because they were a type of human.

1433
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:10,910
Yeah.
They just weren't Homo Sapiens,

1434
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:11,870
right?
Yeah.

1435
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,240
So I'm so stupid to have these 
conversations.

1436
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:15,733
I'm so stupid because I read an entire 
book about sapiens and this whole 

1437
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:22,730
transformation and I just.
The problem is I read when I go to sleep

1438
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,910
and I don't.
I'm so fucking tired.

1439
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,360
Right.
It all goes through me the next night.

1440
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:27,194
I can't even find out.
I can't even find where I left off on 

1441
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:29,744
the book is in reading at night,
like the best way to fucking fall 

1442
01:09:32,061 --> 01:09:32,750
asleep.
Oh yeah.

1443
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:34,580
It makes you go to sleep so much easier.
Yeah.

1444
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,440
Like something about reading.
I'm just conk dude.

1445
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:41,210
My wife opens up our book at night every
night and she,

1446
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:46,270
she does not get to the second page and 
she's sitting upright and I can hear her

1447
01:09:46,521 --> 01:09:49,400
breathing change and she's asleep.
Wow.

1448
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:53,210
I can't.
I take a sleeping pill every night.

1449
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:58,690
Take Asleep.
Taking a Lunesta and the side effects.

1450
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:03,230
I think a loss of memory.
I think that's what it is.

1451
01:10:03,231 --> 01:10:06,140
I'm taking the sleep pill and then I'm 
reading and uh,

1452
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,320
nothing sticks.
But otherwise I can't sleep.

1453
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:10,610
My mother and brothers,
same way.

1454
01:10:10,611 --> 01:10:11,444
We cannot sleep,
we just our minds fucking race and I'll 

1455
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:16,620
lay there for hours and nothing 
happened.

1456
01:10:16,621 --> 01:10:17,454
So I,
I'd rather be a little groggy in the 

1457
01:10:20,331 --> 01:10:24,320
morning then then be exhausted in five.
Have you tried any kind of meditation or

1458
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:26,780
anything to calm your mind for you when 
you started meditating?

1459
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:29,330
But I've,
I only started meditating like two years

1460
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:31,760
ago and I've been taking the sleeping 
pills for probably like four,

1461
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,370
so I should try to get off of him.
It's stupid,

1462
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,800
but I think if you get off those things,
that's where it gets hairy.

1463
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:37,993
Really?
Yeah.

1464
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,340
So if you start going crazy,
call me up so I know,

1465
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,713
I'll know.

1466
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,980
Just say just say,
Hey,

1467
01:10:44,981 --> 01:10:47,410
I tried going off these fucking sleeping
pills.

1468
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:48,550
I'm like okay,
Gotcha.

1469
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:49,930
Failure.

1470
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:52,080
No,
I need you to do my 10:20

1471
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,170
spot at the laugh factory tonight.
I think

1472
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,820
when you get off those things like 
sleeping pills,

1473
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:02,030
they have a real bizarre reaction some 
people have to them or they'll do things

1474
01:11:02,620 --> 01:11:03,453
and wake up in the middle of doing them,
driving down the highway in a shootout 

1475
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:07,500
with the cops.
Like that kind of Shit,

1476
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:10,840
like you wake up in the middle of an act
going,

1477
01:11:10,841 --> 01:11:11,674
what the fuck am I saying?
Why you're on sleeping while you're on 

1478
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:14,200
certain

1479
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,070
sleeping pills.
He,

1480
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:15,933
Ambien is crazy.
Like I ran out and I took a friend's 

1481
01:11:18,171 --> 01:11:21,570
ambien recently and I had the most 
insane dreams.

1482
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,920
Oh,
I've heard.

1483
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,420
I'm terrified of that stuff.
Yeah,

1484
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,970
I know a lot of people who love that 
stuff.

1485
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,330
I Dunno why Ambien is prescribed.
It's the same thing with opioids.

1486
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:32,520
It's like,
why are they still prescribing this shit

1487
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:33,354
when it's so addictive and so dangerous?
Because people want to be able to make 

1488
01:11:36,211 --> 01:11:37,860
their own choices.
You know?

1489
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:38,694
And if you could go to a doctor,
if you're informed correctly and you go 

1490
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:42,570
to a doctor and you go,
look,

1491
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:46,860
I don't give a fuck what they say.
I want a fucking ambient.

1492
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,160
I know it's not good for you.
I know it's bad for my sleep.

1493
01:11:50,161 --> 01:11:52,650
I don't give a fuck.
I need to go to sleep.

1494
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,813
If you're a grown adult,
I feel you should be able to make that 

1495
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:57,474
decision.

1496
01:11:57,680 --> 01:11:59,400
You can.
How come you can make that decision?

1497
01:11:59,401 --> 01:12:00,920
And drank a fucking bottle of,
uh,

1498
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,423
of um,
Ron White's tequila a night if you so 

1499
01:12:04,501 --> 01:12:06,960
choose to.
Why can't you decide to take an ambient?

1500
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:07,850
It's true.
Is it,

1501
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:08,923
is it really worse than getting hammered
and everybody gets hammered and there's 

1502
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:14,010
a lot of people getting hammered.
Well,

1503
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:14,844
it just seems like with all the options,
like I know with Lunesta I don't have 

1504
01:12:17,581 --> 01:12:19,530
these side effects.
Oh really?

1505
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:20,191
Yeah.
I mean,

1506
01:12:20,191 --> 01:12:21,410
no,
it's,

1507
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:22,283
there's no side effects with luminess.
I'm not a paid spokesman for Lunesta by 

1508
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:26,514
the way,
but I just found that I did take ambien 

1509
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:30,060
and it was crazy.
It was like tripping.

1510
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:33,420
So lunesta does it for you.
Lunesta works.

1511
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:34,583
Joe Lunesta works for me.
Have you ever done anything like 

1512
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,380
Melatonin or have you tried like a 
Melatonin?

1513
01:12:41,410 --> 01:12:43,010
Melatonin works.
It's good,

1514
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:43,470
does it?

1515
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:43,951
Yeah.
Yeah,

1516
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:45,300
yeah.
Why don't you just try that then?

1517
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:48,340
Since it's a natural migration,
we like to get addicted to things.

1518
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,720
I put the booze.
So now I drink.

1519
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:53,910
And what is this shit you gave me?
Caveman coffee,

1520
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,950
man.
It's got a nice little kick.

1521
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,660
It's got a hell of a kick.
It's got a hell of a kick to it is.

1522
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:03,030
It's kind of mainly because it doesn't 
taste that good.

1523
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,253
Right,
right.

1524
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:05,550
Well,
it's like black coffee.

1525
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,840
Yeah,
exactly.

1526
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:08,790
Like when I say it doesn't taste that 
good.

1527
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:11,400
I mean it doesn't taste like a Caramel 
Macchiato,

1528
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:12,690
you know?
That's,

1529
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:13,583
that tastes good.
That's what every slurpee like this is 

1530
01:13:16,801 --> 01:13:18,090
delicious,
but it's full of sugar.

1531
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,780
This tastes like a.
we're calling it like a Guinness.

1532
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:22,753
Guinness have coffee.
It's got this weird sort of acquired 

1533
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:28,380
taste for a little fuzziness to it,
which is nice.

1534
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,690
Nitrogenated.

1535
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,490
I don't know why.
I don't know if it works.

1536
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:33,900
More gifts.
You're more fucked up.

1537
01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:36,810
I don't know,
but it's got 270 milligrams caffeine.

1538
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:39,080
Yeah.
I'm a caffeine freak.

1539
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,430
I drink a lot of caffeine.
Yeah,

1540
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:42,264
but that one's manageable.
Does caffeine never really derails your 

1541
01:13:44,971 --> 01:13:49,200
judgment to manageable addiction?
If he got to like a legit addiction,

1542
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,250
caffeine is not a bad one.
Yeah.

1543
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,040
That's,
that's one you can kind of.

1544
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,310
You could skate by with that one.
Cigarettes is going to get.

1545
01:13:56,311 --> 01:13:57,144
Yeah.
That's the one that's gonna get you 

1546
01:13:58,530 --> 01:13:59,363
cigarettes.
Probably the worst thing you can be 

1547
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:01,344
addicted to then heroin,
it seems like pills might be worse than 

1548
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:07,740
cigarettes because you can make rational
decisions when you're on cigarettes.

1549
01:14:07,741 --> 01:14:10,770
The problem is though,
the health consequences of cigarettes or

1550
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:12,160
almost

1551
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,993
inescapable.
We've just made an irrational decision 

1552
01:14:14,771 --> 01:14:16,200
if you're lighting a cigarette.
Yeah,

1553
01:14:17,650 --> 01:14:21,550
so it's got you in a point of addiction 
where you are literally killing yourself

1554
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,393
slowly.
It's kind of amazing that it's still 

1555
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:25,280
around.
It's amazing really.

1556
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:28,520
But again,
I'm 100 percent in favor of people doing

1557
01:14:28,521 --> 01:14:31,700
whatever the fuck they want to do.
If you were informed and you go,

1558
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:33,590
I don't give a shit,
I want a fucking cigarette,

1559
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:36,530
you should be able to do it.
So by that hand,

1560
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,440
if you could do that with booze,
if you could do that.

1561
01:14:39,441 --> 01:14:42,260
When we.
I think freedom is best.

1562
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:45,140
It's best to have people figure it out 
on their own.

1563
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,830
It's best to decide for people what they
can and can't do.

1564
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:50,763
Good.
I think it's the same with raising a 

1565
01:14:51,841 --> 01:14:53,040
kid.
You know,

1566
01:14:53,041 --> 01:14:55,020
I try to give my kids a lot of free 
freedom,

1567
01:14:55,021 --> 01:14:56,280
you know?
I informed them,

1568
01:14:56,670 --> 01:14:59,430
I reign them in,
I try to shepherd them,

1569
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,410
but I don't ride them,
you know,

1570
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:05,100
and when they make mistakes I don't,
I don't overly punish,

1571
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:06,263
I just try to.
I tell them I'm disappointed and that 

1572
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,990
means a lot to them,
but I think that,

1573
01:15:10,050 --> 01:15:11,490
you know,
the,

1574
01:15:11,491 --> 01:15:12,324
this year your kids are,
they need to internalize responsibility 

1575
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:16,943
and the earlier they do it the better 
because then the process of 

1576
01:15:19,351 --> 01:15:20,184
internalizing responsibility should 
start as in in whatever ways you can 

1577
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:25,104
parcel it out from a young age.
That's how you got to do it because by 

1578
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:29,670
the time they move out,
you know,

1579
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:34,050
it's like you're not going to be there 
to make these decisions for them.

1580
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,220
Yeah.
The,

1581
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,053
the,
the task of raising human is probably 

1582
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:44,760
one of the most important things.
One of the most impossible to correct.

1583
01:15:44,761 --> 01:15:45,594
Once you fucked it up and it's put in 
the hands of everybody who is most 

1584
01:15:50,281 --> 01:15:52,290
likely raised incorrectly themselves.

1585
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,491
Well,
the hope is,

1586
01:15:55,491 --> 01:15:58,150
is more therapy than there was today.
There's more literature,

1587
01:15:58,151 --> 01:16:01,750
there's more studies and I do think 
we're more informed about what we do.

1588
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,660
I think we're more vigilant about it.
I think men,

1589
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:05,523
the fact that I just said that to 
another man that wouldn't have happened 

1590
01:16:08,321 --> 01:16:12,040
25 years ago,
no guy would talk about parenting in any

1591
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:13,390
deep way to another man.

1592
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,460
No,
it was kinda almost gay.

1593
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:18,980
Yeah,
it was.

1594
01:16:18,981 --> 01:16:21,140
It was not,
it was not your role to do that.

1595
01:16:21,141 --> 01:16:23,390
And now pay parents.
It's a partnership,

1596
01:16:23,391 --> 01:16:26,120
the mother and the father because the 
worst thing,

1597
01:16:26,121 --> 01:16:29,930
and I know a couple that's like this 
where they're never on the same page and

1598
01:16:29,931 --> 01:16:33,320
their kids are all fucked up and neither
one of them is a bad parent.

1599
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,490
They're just doing it in opposite ways,
ways.

1600
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,350
What's the.
He's very like,

1601
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,980
you know,
uh,

1602
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:43,910
checked out in some ways,
but like in the way,

1603
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:49,010
not in a healthy way,
I describe the hands off is still caring

1604
01:16:49,011 --> 01:16:51,770
and controlling and supporting his is a 
little bit more,

1605
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,990
a little bit more like I can't handle 
this.

1606
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:55,183
Hers is,
she's super eight type personality and 

1607
01:16:57,771 --> 01:17:00,700
she's trying to drive the kids to be,
you know,

1608
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:02,180
the best,
their best potential,

1609
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,040
which is good.
A little bit of that is good.

1610
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,900
And little bit of what he's doing is 
good,

1611
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:10,490
but they're both polar opposites and not
really their strategies

1612
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,710
will either.
But I,

1613
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,713
I really think that the,
the main thing is that your kids can't 

1614
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:18,130
feel like they're getting two different 
messages at the same time.

1615
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:21,680
Time for Mommy and daddy can't feel like
they're being smothered either.

1616
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:22,880
Right?
You know,

1617
01:17:23,150 --> 01:17:26,280
one of the things about kids that you 
find out real early,

1618
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,120
if you tell them not to do something,
that's what they want to do.

1619
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:32,360
They don't want you telling them what to
do because they're little people.

1620
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,473
Even though they might be five or six,
there's still little people and people 

1621
01:17:38,301 --> 01:17:41,930
don't like you telling them what to do.
You got to explain to them,

1622
01:17:41,931 --> 01:17:42,764
it's much better to explain to them why 
it's important that you do the thing 

1623
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:48,430
that you don't want to do and why it's a
good thing.

1624
01:17:48,431 --> 01:17:50,210
You've got to change the way you think 
about it.

1625
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,620
Don't think about it like,
Oh,

1626
01:17:51,621 --> 01:17:53,330
it's this chore.
Think about it.

1627
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:54,164
Like,
this is just a thing that I have to do 

1628
01:17:55,761 --> 01:17:56,594
right now and I'm so lucky in so many 
ways and that's how I should look at 

1629
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:03,500
life and that jumped on.
Don't just get annoyed at things.

1630
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:06,110
You know,
you don't want to go to bed,

1631
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,630
go to bed,
you got to get sleep.

1632
01:18:08,631 --> 01:18:10,850
I know you don't want to go to bed.
I get it.

1633
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:11,953
I feel the same way all the time.
But as a person who's in charge of your 

1634
01:18:14,541 --> 01:18:17,090
biology,
I know that you're not quite wise enough

1635
01:18:17,091 --> 01:18:19,040
to make the decisions.
You want to be healthy.

1636
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,890
Your little kids need to get like 10 to 
12 hours sleep.

1637
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,153
How do you get to tell them?
Give them the association that they're 

1638
01:18:25,431 --> 01:18:29,180
making choices and that their choices 
have ramifications.

1639
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:30,014
You're going to wake up to you that 
sometimes it's hard for me to wake you 

1640
01:18:32,091 --> 01:18:35,000
up and it hurts in the morning.
Will they won't be that way.

1641
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,690
If you go to sleep now,
you'll wake up and you'll feel good.

1642
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:40,170
Yeah,
that's man.

1643
01:18:40,350 --> 01:18:43,350
That is the fucking biggest difference 
when,

1644
01:18:43,410 --> 01:18:46,200
when I had day jobs and um,
you know,

1645
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:47,123
a lot of times I was a,
like for years I had sleep deprivation 

1646
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:53,820
because I was getting up in the morning 
for delivering the newspapers and it was

1647
01:18:53,821 --> 01:18:54,654
trying to go back to sleep,
but I always stayed up at night because 

1648
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:58,740
I was doing stand up and like for the 
longest time,

1649
01:18:58,741 --> 01:19:02,190
like I was really screwed up.
And then once I quit doing that,

1650
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:03,083
once I just started doing,
just stand up and I started getting 

1651
01:19:05,431 --> 01:19:06,264
sleep.
Like I go to bed after the clubs and I 

1652
01:19:09,061 --> 01:19:13,560
would get up at 11,
wake up and I felt so good.

1653
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:15,270
I was like,
oh my God.

1654
01:19:15,271 --> 01:19:16,590
Like,
everything feels great.

1655
01:19:16,591 --> 01:19:19,740
Like I don't feel like I'm constantly at
a lack.

1656
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,660
That feeling that you have when you're 
tired all the time.

1657
01:19:21,661 --> 01:19:22,494
When you work too many hours you don't 
get enough sleep because that fucking 

1658
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:29,610
feeling like you're always at a lack.
There's always like a hole in your,

1659
01:19:29,611 --> 01:19:32,830
your,
your biological game as it were.

1660
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,310
I'm just,
ugh.

1661
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,860
Just trying to be left alone.
Yeah,

1662
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:37,650
just,
you just don't.

1663
01:19:37,651 --> 01:19:40,860
But if you can get that solid eight to 
10 hours sleep,

1664
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:44,970
that goes away,
especially if you can get 10,

1665
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:48,690
but he could only get eight.
It's worth so much,

1666
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:49,200
you know?
Yeah.

1667
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,700
So fucking value through it.

1668
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:52,810
Throw a 20 minute meditation on top of 
that.

1669
01:19:52,811 --> 01:19:53,644
The next day around 2:30
in the afternoon when you're crashing 

1670
01:19:56,081 --> 01:19:56,950
out after lunch

1671
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,980
if you can do that.
That's a good move.

1672
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,570
Yeah.
If you could just sit down.

1673
01:20:00,571 --> 01:20:03,560
I mean the meditation,
just the,

1674
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:04,394
the,
the word meditation is so loaded you 

1675
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,190
because it has

1676
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,850
that.
There's a sort of like A.

1677
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:12,660
Oh,
a lot of us I think have this idea about

1678
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:14,130
people meditate is like,
ah,

1679
01:20:14,660 --> 01:20:15,493
you know,
he's just trying to find some spiritual 

1680
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:18,204
peace and this is like some masturbatory
weirdness and you stand in front of 

1681
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:24,510
fucking incense and pretend you're from 
a different culture.

1682
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:30,240
But I think that just being alone with 
your thoughts and just your thoughts and

1683
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,393
just concentrating on just thinking 
about as little as possible was just 

1684
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:36,810
thinking maybe even just about 
breathing.

1685
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:41,760
I'm breathing in and breathing out.
Just that alone is a form of meditation.

1686
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:43,100
Yeah.
I mean,

1687
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:45,410
it's like it's,
it's a guided sleep.

1688
01:20:45,470 --> 01:20:47,120
Think of it as taking a nap.
You know,

1689
01:20:47,121 --> 01:20:49,340
Eckhart tolle talks about,
you know,

1690
01:20:49,341 --> 01:20:50,450
with,
with meditation,

1691
01:20:50,451 --> 01:20:51,284
it's just really,
it's reminding you to not think about 

1692
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:54,950
the past to the future for a little 
while.

1693
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:55,784
It's about just thinking about the 
breathing that's happening right now or 

1694
01:20:58,281 --> 01:21:01,910
the mantra that's happening right now 
and when you come out of it,

1695
01:21:02,210 --> 01:21:03,770
you're not going to stay in that state 
all day,

1696
01:21:03,771 --> 01:21:08,480
but you will have brought yourself back 
to that point if only for 20 minutes and

1697
01:21:08,481 --> 01:21:09,314
that will sort of,
that will guide you for the rest of the 

1698
01:21:11,391 --> 01:21:12,224
day.

1699
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:13,163
Yeah.
I think the momentum of most people's 

1700
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:19,260
lives is so strong.
Mine included,

1701
01:21:19,261 --> 01:21:24,261
I'm sure yours included that are 
oftentimes you just get caught up in how

1702
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:28,320
you're thinking or how you're behaving 
or what you're doing.

1703
01:21:28,321 --> 01:21:30,510
You just get caught up in it.
Like it's just like,

1704
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:33,300
wow.
It's like pushing you from behind and if

1705
01:21:33,301 --> 01:21:38,301
you can just stop as often as possible 
and do nothing for an hour and breathe,

1706
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:41,093
just do nothing but think and breathe.
You come out of it with a more balanced 

1707
01:21:44,221 --> 01:21:45,060
perspective.

1708
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:48,160
You make better decisions.
You're not reacting to things

1709
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,320
exactly.
You're not.

1710
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,213
You're not being pushed from behind by 
the momentum of everything you've 

1711
01:21:53,011 --> 01:21:55,350
experienced over the last x amount of 
months.

1712
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:59,790
You get a fresh restart to contemplate 
your existence.

1713
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:00,650
Well,
you know,

1714
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:01,503
we can't do anything about the past,
but here's where we are right now and 

1715
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:04,380
this is what we.
Okay.

1716
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:07,170
Now I've decided that instead of 
concentrating on that,

1717
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,033
I'm going to concentrate on this and it 
give yourself like a chance to almost 

1718
01:22:10,861 --> 01:22:15,400
give yourself a little personal seminar.
Give yourself a little garlic will.

1719
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:17,010
Okay.
Are you happy about this?

1720
01:22:17,011 --> 01:22:18,900
Like,
like if you were giving yourself advice,

1721
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:21,240
he'd probably be way different than what
you actually do.

1722
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,590
You know,
I've always thought that if I was giving

1723
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:27,290
myself advice,
like how,

1724
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:29,220
what,
how brutal would I be with myself?

1725
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,600
Honest,
would I be with myself?

1726
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,530
Well,
that's why you're supposed to set goals,

1727
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:36,790
because goals are you sitting down in a 
cold calculating way and saying,

1728
01:22:36,970 --> 01:22:39,850
where do I want to be in a year?
What are the steps that I need to get to

1729
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:40,684
that and then setting small goals to get
you there because day to day you're 

1730
01:22:43,481 --> 01:22:44,314
reacting to people are codependent with 
their wives or their kids instead of 

1731
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:48,183
reacting to that.
You're wondering if your phone's going 

1732
01:22:50,061 --> 01:22:50,894
to ring.
You're wondering what people are saying 

1733
01:22:51,641 --> 01:22:52,474
on social media.
There's so many dynamics that have you 

1734
01:22:55,390 --> 01:22:58,570
spinning around and not in your own 
space.

1735
01:22:58,571 --> 01:22:59,404
So that said,
that's what I love the beginning of the 

1736
01:23:01,061 --> 01:23:01,894
year.
I love sitting down and setting up some 

1737
01:23:02,921 --> 01:23:04,150
new goals.
I mean,

1738
01:23:04,151 --> 01:23:06,100
you and I just talked a couple of nights
ago

1739
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,933
about that.
Like your goal is to sort of try to not 

1740
01:23:09,191 --> 01:23:11,950
get off social media more.
Not Answer your phone all day.

1741
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:13,900
Mine cast,
stay off my phone for many,

1742
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:15,400
many hours at a time.
Yeah,

1743
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:16,234
that's the big one.
And I'm just thinking about the amount 

1744
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:21,220
of time that I spend.
Just looking for something interesting.

1745
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:24,640
Looking on twitter feed,
looking on facebook or on,

1746
01:23:24,641 --> 01:23:25,720
um,
instagram.

1747
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:26,763
Just looking for something interesting.
I'm going to just fluttering through 

1748
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:30,340
fucking pictures of Shit.
Oh look,

1749
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:31,900
another car all.
Look at that lion.

1750
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:34,470
That's crazy.
After awhile,

1751
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:37,480
chimpanzee attacking a car.
Well,

1752
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:40,300
that video that I showed you today,
that's how I found it.

1753
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,120
The fucking lady that hit that,
or the guy that hit that moves.

1754
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:45,580
I don't know if the guy or girl,
whoever the fucking hit that moves,

1755
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:47,013
but I'm inundated by that and people 
keep sending me these fucking videos of 

1756
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:54,750
these Russian crazy like acrobats doing 
flips on the top of buildings.

1757
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,400
You've seen those guys daredevils,
these Russian daredevil characters.

1758
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:03,940
They go on the top of buildings and do 
like handstands and glean their feet off

1759
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:05,530
the edge.
You can't watch it,

1760
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:07,300
man.
It's hard to watch.

1761
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:08,583
It's too fucking scary.
I mean it's fucking terrifying and some 

1762
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:13,950
of them get up on top of him with those 
hoverboards,

1763
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:18,080
those little wheely boards and they'd go
like to the edge and that.

1764
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:18,943
That makes me uncomfortable.
You just describing it and they spin 

1765
01:24:20,891 --> 01:24:24,370
around.
Who's the skyscraper?

1766
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:25,413
Look at this.

1767
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,220
This is in Russia.
This.

1768
01:24:28,221 --> 01:24:29,480
I don't know where this one is,
but they're.

1769
01:24:29,481 --> 01:24:32,090
Do they do these all over the place?
I think this is Dubai.

1770
01:24:32,360 --> 01:24:37,360
This guy is on the fucking edge of a 
crazy skyscraper.

1771
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:39,081
Like,
what is that?

1772
01:24:39,081 --> 01:24:43,670
100 stories.
High holy days doing a handstand.

1773
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:47,330
Oh,
came down backwards.

1774
01:24:47,370 --> 01:24:50,690
Oh,
that was terrifying.

1775
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:53,510
What do you.
What do you do after that?

1776
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:58,280
I just hurt my elbow reacting to that.
I whacked my phone.

1777
01:24:59,870 --> 01:25:00,703
That's hilarious.
This guy's got a helmet on and his 

1778
01:25:05,431 --> 01:25:10,250
underwear and he's walking on a bar.
Oh my God.

1779
01:25:10,251 --> 01:25:13,970
That is so crazy.
These kids are fucking nuts,

1780
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:17,480
man.
Jesus Christ.

1781
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:22,670
This guy's doing a balance beam over a.
It looks like a harbor.

1782
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,713
I don't know how far down it is,
but he's way the fuck up on some 

1783
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,130
criminal oil rig and looked like.
Oh my goodness.

1784
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,880
Uh,

1785
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:33,523
uh.
Yeah.

1786
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:34,620
A,
I'm,

1787
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:35,830
I think I'm done.
I'm done.

1788
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,090
I'm done.
I'm done.

1789
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,280
I used to do crazy shit.
My friend,

1790
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:42,430
my friend lived on the fifth floor of 
and apart building and there's a picture

1791
01:25:42,431 --> 01:25:46,600
of me when I was about 14 hanging off 
his balcony by my knees.

1792
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:48,200
Oh my God,
I will.

1793
01:25:48,201 --> 01:25:49,034
I was into gymnastics.
I did gymnastics pretty hard for like 

1794
01:25:50,951 --> 01:25:53,890
six years.
So I would hang off anything I would do,

1795
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:57,190
I would do flips off fucking anything 
anywhere.

1796
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:58,330
Yeah.
Dude,

1797
01:25:58,331 --> 01:26:00,520
I got sweaty hands.
Just looking at that.

1798
01:26:00,521 --> 01:26:01,990
I do too.
Sweaty hands.

1799
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,800
Don't show this

1800
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,740
Jamie.
God Damn it.

1801
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:09,410
That guy jumped off the roof into a 
pool.

1802
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,303
I mean,
how many stories is six stories to shut 

1803
01:26:14,581 --> 01:26:15,890
this off?
I can't do this anymore.

1804
01:26:16,180 --> 01:26:18,110
Oh my hands are fucking sweaty,
man.

1805
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:22,920
There's like soaking wet.
Feel them feel Jesus wet,

1806
01:26:23,670 --> 01:26:25,880
soaking wet.
I'm.

1807
01:26:25,881 --> 01:26:26,930
Hey,
can I plug some dates?

1808
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,800
Come on everybody.
I got my big winter,

1809
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:33,620

1820
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:06,860
It's it the Irvine Improv,
the new Irvine Improv is fucking awesome

1821
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,033
dude.
Right?

1822
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,630
Giant.
I did it once and uh,

1823
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:11,960
I just remember I didn't,
uh,

1824
01:27:11,961 --> 01:27:12,800
I didn't fill it.

1825
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,490
I'll tell you that by no means that I 
feel it is a very big place.

1826
01:27:16,491 --> 01:27:17,890
Yeah.
But I'm doing it then.

1827
01:27:17,930 --> 01:27:21,000
I've got to St Patrick's Day shows,
uh,

1828
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,510
which you've done I think the last three
years.

1829
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:25,460
You've done my Saint Patrick's day show 
a pet,

1830
01:27:25,461 --> 01:27:26,294
the Hollywood improv.
I have to support the one quarter Irish 

1831
01:27:28,281 --> 01:27:28,610
though,
man.

1832
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,290
That's right.
Get in there for that.

1833
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,850
That's always a fun show though,
isn't it?

1834
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:35,270
Pack it out.
We get all Irish comics on it.

1835
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,700
Throw a black guy in there just to keep 
it.

1836
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,320
Keep the fucking pc police off my back.
Get Ian Edwards on there.

1837
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,600
Yeah,
that's a fun show,

1838
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:45,890
man.
Yeah,

1839
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:47,480
it's good.
Joey Diaz.

1840
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:51,230
I did a one year and it was um,
it was all the cool comics.

1841
01:27:51,290 --> 01:27:54,380
And then Joey Diaz,
he was like Zach Galifianakis,

1842
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,273
Sarah Silverman and know Andy Kindler.
And they went up and they didn't know 

1843
01:27:59,001 --> 01:27:59,834
who Joey Diaz was and uh,
I had him go on like second just to 

1844
01:28:03,801 --> 01:28:04,634
fucking,
just to raise the bar and everybody 

1845
01:28:05,931 --> 01:28:06,764
else.

1846
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:07,813
And he went up there and he's doing this
whole bit about having some chick piss 

1847
01:28:12,651 --> 01:28:17,651
in his mouth in a bathtub and I'm 
drinking it like a soldier and uh,

1848
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,980
and the place they don't know what to 
make of him.

1849
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:22,814
At first it takes some,
it takes them like a good two minutes 

1850
01:28:25,640 --> 01:28:28,520
for them to just pick their jaws up off 
the table,

1851
01:28:28,521 --> 01:28:29,354
put the,
put the job back in their head and then 

1852
01:28:30,861 --> 01:28:35,861
start to laugh.
And then you just saw them convulsed and

1853
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:37,580
in the back,
Sarah and all them,

1854
01:28:37,581 --> 01:28:39,680
they're going like,
who is this guy?

1855
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,570
What,
what is this?

1856
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:43,730
I go,
this is fucking Joey Diaz.

1857
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:46,640
They didn't know.
They didn't know when.

1858
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:49,310
How long ago was this?
Two years ago.

1859
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:52,460
Wow.
I did not know who Joey d is,

1860
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:55,460
is because he doesn't work.
I don't think he works the Improv.

1861
01:28:55,461 --> 01:28:56,294
Does he have a different comic knows 
like you hear about like a guy like you 

1862
01:28:59,691 --> 01:29:02,070
always hear about.
So I heard about big Jay oakerson

1863
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,903
before I saw him.

1864
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:04,530
You gotta see this guy.
It's very foreign.

1865
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:06,910
I think maybe there's this,
you know,

1866
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:10,300
splintered comedy world.
Exact doesn't do a ton of stand up and I

1867
01:29:10,301 --> 01:29:10,991
think,
uh,

1868
01:29:10,991 --> 01:29:11,824
you know,
Sarah,

1869
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:14,040
Sarah works the comedy store sometimes.
Sometimes.

1870
01:29:14,050 --> 01:29:16,540
I've seen her there a few times.
Not as often as she should.

1871
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,660
What are you judging?
Well,

1872
01:29:19,661 --> 01:29:21,190
she needs you.
She needs that,

1873
01:29:21,191 --> 01:29:22,810
you know,
I think some comics they work,

1874
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:26,280
they'll work largo a lot and uh,
and I think it,

1875
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:28,180
you can,
you can draw your own crowd,

1876
01:29:28,450 --> 01:29:29,283
but she's like a real comic.
She can play in a room like the store 

1877
01:29:32,261 --> 01:29:33,094
where they didn't all come to see her 
and she can fucking prove something to 

1878
01:29:35,711 --> 01:29:38,530
people that maybe don't know what a good
comic she is.

1879
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:39,820
Yeah.

1880
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:42,680
Well I would agree with you that I think
she's one of the best comics live.

1881
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:43,690
Sure.
She,

1882
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:47,110
she killed at the comedy store last time
I saw her,

1883
01:29:47,111 --> 01:29:49,390
which was,
I want to say it was quite awhile ago.

1884
01:29:49,391 --> 01:29:51,520
It might've been a year ago,
matter of fact,

1885
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:53,740
sometime between now and a year.
Anyway,

1886
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:57,160
she destroyed and I was laughing really 
hard.

1887
01:29:57,410 --> 01:30:00,520
There was some funny shit in there,
but on the other hand,

1888
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,000
she's obviously got money and she's 
obviously comfortable,

1889
01:30:04,020 --> 01:30:05,990
so she should do whatever the fuck she 
wants.

1890
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:07,833
Right.
I mean there's guys like Paul f 

1891
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:11,530
Tompkins,
that dude,

1892
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:15,220
I haven't seen him in a comedy club in 
10 years,

1893
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:18,550
but he does his show at Largo.
I don't know how often and he does.

1894
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,160
He'll go to San Francisco and fucking 
sellout cobb's.

1895
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,860
The guy's got his circuit.
He's got his crowd.

1896
01:30:24,010 --> 01:30:24,843
I think it makes a very nice living and 
I think he does the style of comedy he 

1897
01:30:28,421 --> 01:30:31,750
does,
which is a little bit more storytelling.

1898
01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:32,643
It's a little slower,
a little more esoteric may not work in 

1899
01:30:35,081 --> 01:30:36,910
the other kinds of clubs.
So yeah,

1900
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:37,744
maybe it fosters his ability to go 
deeper into what he's doing by playing 

1901
01:30:41,531 --> 01:30:42,520
select clubs.

1902
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:43,813
Yeah,
I mean I guess it's all in whether or 

1903
01:30:44,691 --> 01:30:48,500
not what you enjoy doing,
whether it fits in with clubs.

1904
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:50,540
Yeah,
because some people it just doesn't.

1905
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,540
Some people they don't enjoy just always
being,

1906
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,240
you know,
always going for the laugh always.

1907
01:30:56,270 --> 01:30:59,300
You know like what,
like our style Boston style,

1908
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:01,460
like Boston styles,
like punchline set up,

1909
01:31:01,461 --> 01:31:02,294
punchline set up punchline and to try to
build punchlines and some people have 

1910
01:31:05,661 --> 01:31:06,494
like they,
they want to tell you a story that 

1911
01:31:08,541 --> 01:31:09,374
happens to be humorous.
They don't want to be confined by this 

1912
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:13,940
idea that it has to be set up punchline 
set up punchline.

1913
01:31:13,941 --> 01:31:16,280
So it is sorta stand up and a lot of 
ways,

1914
01:31:16,281 --> 01:31:19,100
but in a lot of ways it's not.
It's like you're,

1915
01:31:19,101 --> 01:31:21,500
you're,
you're being an orator,

1916
01:31:21,501 --> 01:31:23,240
a narrator,
you're telling stories,

1917
01:31:23,270 --> 01:31:25,070
you know,
which is cool too,

1918
01:31:25,310 --> 01:31:26,143
you know,
like there's a lot of people who like 

1919
01:31:28,671 --> 01:31:30,080
Henry Rollins is a great example.

1920
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:33,530
You wouldn't say that necessarily.
What he does is stand up.

1921
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:35,990
You would say it's a spoken word thing,
right?

1922
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:37,850
But what is he doing?
He's telling stories,

1923
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:39,740
you know,
I mean they're just,

1924
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,823
they have punchlines.
They have like very clear setup and 

1925
01:31:42,441 --> 01:31:43,274
punchlines that I'm,
I guess obviously he knows where the 

1926
01:31:44,781 --> 01:31:47,780
funny parts are so he's kind of doing 
standup,

1927
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:48,973
but he's doing it his fucking way.
Like if a lot of people really liked 

1928
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:53,834
that is what my point is like and they 
don't want to go see him try to do a 15 

1929
01:31:58,371 --> 01:31:59,204
minute set at the.

1930
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:00,653
It can change.
Like I find that if I go through a run 

1931
01:32:02,901 --> 01:32:07,740
of clubs that are bad,
I'm like say Florida.

1932
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:12,540
It changes the way I'm doing standup 
because in Florida you've got.

1933
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:13,673
It's just a schizo side crowd.
You've got rednecks mixed in with old 

1934
01:32:17,311 --> 01:32:18,144
people mixed in with Latino's mixed in 
with fucking spring breakers or 

1935
01:32:21,241 --> 01:32:23,430
whatever.
It's never one crowd.

1936
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:25,470
You have no fucking idea who you're 
applying to.

1937
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:27,760
So you're up there for an hour and 
you're just.

1938
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:29,820
It's a drunk and knife fight in the 
alleys.

1939
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:32,760
You're just trying to fucking keep your 
spinning plates.

1940
01:32:32,761 --> 01:32:35,320
You're trying to keep this guy happy.
This guy's Hecklin,

1941
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:36,303
they're not paying attention.
And I find that like it makes my act 

1942
01:32:39,361 --> 01:32:43,830
worse because I'm not getting in the 
pocket and doing what I want to do.

1943
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:46,470
I'm pleasing because I'm trying to 
survive.

1944
01:32:46,550 --> 01:32:47,383
Right.
And then you go to a club like fucking 

1945
01:32:49,471 --> 01:32:54,090
Austin Cap City and Austin,
Texas and Holy Shit,

1946
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:54,924
man,
you just kicked back and they come to 

1947
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:58,950
you.
I just did Madison,

1948
01:32:58,951 --> 01:33:00,630
Wisconsin.
They came to me.

1949
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:04,240
Oh,
madison is a really cool town.

1950
01:33:04,270 --> 01:33:06,040
Yeah,
it is really interesting.

1951
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:08,830
Yeah.
Like super open minded.

1952
01:33:08,831 --> 01:33:11,580
Liberal Wisconsin town.
Yeah.

1953
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:14,200
What a great theater.
There's a theater there too.

1954
01:33:14,201 --> 01:33:16,300
What the hell is that theater there?
Is it acme theater?

1955
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:17,800
No.
Did I make that up?

1956
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:19,470
No.
Acme is in Minneapolis.

1957
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:21,940
It means the comedy club in Minneapolis.
Right.

1958
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:27,240
The theater in Madison or film.
I don't know.

1959
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,460
I had a point,
but it's fucking lost.

1960
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,880
There's an orpheum there.
Maybe that's where I went.

1961
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:35,570
Yeah.
It's a great little city.

1962
01:33:35,571 --> 01:33:37,430
It's a college town.
That's where I went.

1963
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:39,950
Good food is really only one block 
though.

1964
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:41,270
Yes,
not a lot.

1965
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:43,790
It's psyche.
There's a block that goes from the State

1966
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:46,460
House to the university and there's not 
much often,

1967
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:48,453
and again,
it's one of those places where people 

1968
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:54,830
that are living in a place where it gets
really,

1969
01:33:54,831 --> 01:33:57,950
really,
really fucking cold theater family.

1970
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:01,640
That's where I was.
Those people are hardier like that thing

1971
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:02,750
that we're talking about.
Yeah.

1972
01:34:02,751 --> 01:34:05,060
This idea that you might not make it 
home tonight.

1973
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,193
There's a god blizzard.
You might get stuck in the side of the 

1974
01:34:07,401 --> 01:34:11,030
road and you see flashing like a light 
on the side of the road.

1975
01:34:11,031 --> 01:34:11,864
Like someone's hazard lights.
They pulled over like a lot of times 

1976
01:34:14,691 --> 01:34:16,940
people help because that person might 
die.

1977
01:34:16,941 --> 01:34:19,970
Like there's a difference between like 
if you see somebody on the four,

1978
01:34:19,971 --> 01:34:20,804
oh five and they were pulled over.
Do you ever even think for a fucking 

1979
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:24,920
second pulling over and helping them?
No.

1980
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:25,903
No,
but if you were driving down a snowy 

1981
01:34:27,051 --> 01:34:27,884
road in New Hampshire and you saw 
someone pull over the side of the road 

1982
01:34:29,781 --> 01:34:32,390
and you start thinking,
what if that's a mom with her kids?

1983
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:33,910
What did she think?
It's great.

1984
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:36,880
It totally fosters community when you 
live in a harsher,

1985
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:37,714
whether you have a trust and there's 
like a symbiotic relationship with your 

1986
01:34:41,081 --> 01:34:42,750
neighbors and you know,
I,

1987
01:34:42,751 --> 01:34:43,584
I think that like you think about people
that live up in Alaska and how they 

1988
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:47,374
share supplies and fucking in the spring
help rebuild a barn and you know that 

1989
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:53,380
that's community that's living.
I mean,

1990
01:34:53,381 --> 01:34:58,381
in La our needs is so easily met.
It just don't have any fucking.

1991
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:02,570
Our roof doesn't go bad because it rains
three days a year and you know,

1992
01:35:02,571 --> 01:35:03,404
you can take an uber here and you could 
get a fucking yelp review on the Sushi 

1993
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:07,550
play.
It's all easy.

1994
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:09,650
It all comes to you.
There's no sense of,

1995
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:10,970
yeah,
I don't need to help you.

1996
01:35:10,971 --> 01:35:11,890
I,
if I hang out with you,

1997
01:35:11,891 --> 01:35:14,250
it's because I want to hang out with you
there.

1998
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:17,060
You hang out with your neighbor because 
you're fucking surviving together.

1999
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,113
We were all hanging out in the back of 
the comedy store last night and we were 

2000
01:35:20,191 --> 01:35:21,024
all stoned and we're all laughing and 
giggling and joking around and I was 

2001
01:35:25,411 --> 01:35:26,244
thinking,
boy,

2002
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:31,340
like what a great place this is to be 
like at the sunset strip in Hollywood in

2003
01:35:31,531 --> 01:35:35,060
2016.
And then all I could think of because of

2004
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:39,540
the pod probably was like,
what if an asteroid,

2005
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:42,300
just not even a big one,
but a pretty big one.

2006
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:47,070
Just slammed into downtown La Right now.
Not enough to kill me,

2007
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,070
but enough for me to just feel the 
impact.

2008
01:35:50,071 --> 01:35:50,904
See that thing flying through the sky 
and hear the people scream and run for 

2009
01:35:54,421 --> 01:35:55,254
the hills and realize.
I realized at that moment because I was 

2010
01:35:58,711 --> 01:35:59,760
so high,
I was like,

2011
01:35:59,761 --> 01:36:04,200
how fragile is this existence that we 
think is so concrete.

2012
01:36:04,201 --> 01:36:05,034
We think it's so locked in and permanent
and secure and all we take is one 

2013
01:36:09,781 --> 01:36:14,550
fucking rock that comes from this guy.
Boom in the downtown La.

2014
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:18,940
Kill a half a million people and then 
the rest of us at beaches,

2015
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:20,790
shit in our pants and terror

2016
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,170
on highway goes out in la,
we're fucked.

2017
01:36:24,171 --> 01:36:26,710
Fucked because there's only two roads 
downtown.

2018
01:36:26,711 --> 01:36:28,430
There's the 10 and the four.
Oh five.

2019
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,360
And if those go either one of those go.
The city shuts down to.

2020
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:33,194
This is such a stupid place to live.
There was three earthquakes last night 

2021
01:36:35,871 --> 01:36:36,710
too.
Yeah.

2022
01:36:36,890 --> 01:36:37,850
Yeah.
Three earthquakes.

2023
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:41,450
A pretty big one on the Nevada border.
Five point seven.

2024
01:36:41,810 --> 01:36:44,180
That's a pretty big one.
It's not a,

2025
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:46,210
you know,
a one like a,

2026
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:47,630
the 19,
90 whatever the fuck.

2027
01:36:47,631 --> 01:36:50,840
It was one which was a lot higher.
That was more than seven,

2028
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:55,880
but this was a significant earthquake.
Five point seven is a pretty good shock,

2029
01:36:56,390 --> 01:36:57,223
but that's what's so weird about.
I mean you talk about it being tenuous 

2030
01:36:59,571 --> 01:37:04,040
and all that is that that shit can fuck 
things up bad and people go,

2031
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:07,820
oh we do,
but we just elected an earthquake

2032
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:09,663
we chose

2033
01:37:09,730 --> 01:37:14,520
was a fucking tragedy to happen.
And if you're a trump supporter,

2034
01:37:15,510 --> 01:37:17,820
go fuck yourself.
You fucked us.

2035
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,040
Can I?
Thanks for coming.

2036
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:24,320
These liberals in Hollywood that think 
they can talk down to you,

2037
01:37:24,321 --> 01:37:27,290
the good people of trump landia you just
watch.

2038
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:28,363
I am not on his side.
I do not support any of the statements 

2039
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,433
and I think it's about time we showed a 
little respect for the office of 

2040
01:37:36,921 --> 01:37:41,120
Commander in chief.
Maybe he will rise to the job.

2041
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:43,100
He could.
Maybe.

2042
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:46,900
Maybe we can get him some mushrooms.
Maybe he will have a,

2043
01:37:46,901 --> 01:37:47,734
a revelation while he's in office that 
this has achieved the highest 

2044
01:37:50,721 --> 01:37:53,000
achievement than any human being can 
ever attain.

2045
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:56,070
That he has won the race and now and

2046
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:56,903
maybe he will change his entire cabinet 
appointments that he's made over the 

2047
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:01,163
last month and like Bill Gates dedicate 
the remaining years of his life to 

2048
01:38:03,361 --> 01:38:04,980
philanthropy work.
Yes.

2049
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:06,540
You know,
Joe,

2050
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,020
my attitude towards this year was 
supposed to be positive and you just saw

2051
01:38:10,021 --> 01:38:12,970
an example of negativity come out 
negative.

2052
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,690
I can't do it.
I can't go negative on it.

2053
01:38:15,691 --> 01:38:19,080
I can be vigilant.
I can keep an eye on what he does.

2054
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:20,183
My wife has this app where every day she
can call or write a congressmen or a 

2055
01:38:23,911 --> 01:38:24,744
cause or a place you can donate money so
that you feel like every day what's the 

2056
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:28,914
APP called you?
No,

2057
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:30,090
no.
I'll find out.

2058
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:31,530
I'll find out.
Jimmy could find it,

2059
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:36,920
but it's a way of not feeling alienated 
and not feeling isolated and like you're

2060
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,180
doing something whether or not it makes 
a difference.

2061
01:38:39,181 --> 01:38:42,240
Maybe it does.
Well if everybody reacts that way,

2062
01:38:42,241 --> 01:38:43,110
it makes a difference.

2063
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:43,953
It's really sheer numbers.
So we have used it on as an example on 

2064
01:38:47,401 --> 01:38:48,234
the show before,
but you remember when the United States 

2065
01:38:49,561 --> 01:38:50,394
had that I'm the president had the press
conference where Obama was saying that 

2066
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,730
we're probably going to go to war with 
Syria and America was like,

2067
01:38:56,731 --> 01:38:59,610
fuck you.
It was a unanimous across the board.

2068
01:38:59,611 --> 01:39:00,421
Right.
And left.

2069
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:01,254
So when he said that he drew a line in 
the sand about if they use chemical 

2070
01:39:03,181 --> 01:39:04,350
weapons,
we'd go to war.

2071
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:06,990
Yeah.
There was something along those lines.

2072
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:10,800
Yeah.
If there was a fucking blatant rejection

2073
01:39:10,801 --> 01:39:12,510
by the American people,
it was very obvious.

2074
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,530
Very vocal and no,
no commentators though,

2075
01:39:16,590 --> 01:39:18,330
right or left.
We're saying this is a good idea,

2076
01:39:18,331 --> 01:39:19,164
like this is a terrible idea.
I want to go to another fucking 

2077
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:24,690
unwinnable war in Syria and so it 
stopped.

2078
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:26,000
Yeah.
Stopped.

2079
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:26,843
I mean obviously it's a terrible fucking
place and you know that it's terrible 

2080
01:39:31,021 --> 01:39:32,670
videos that are coming out of there 
every day.

2081
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:36,390
It's a salient.
It's just fucking wiped out to insane.

2082
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,130
It's insane.
I don't think,

2083
01:39:38,730 --> 01:39:42,720
I mean it's hard for us to even imagine 
what it would be like to be living there

2084
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:46,680
living over here and fucking Los Angeles
where everything's perfect.

2085
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:51,300
Imagine what it's like to be someone who
just buy a bad roll the dice.

2086
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:53,970
You were born over there.
I've had parts of Africa,

2087
01:39:53,971 --> 01:39:54,804
you know,
south Sudan and Congo and places were 

2088
01:39:57,630 --> 01:39:58,463
places where people are giving their 
lives in the street because there were 

2089
01:40:01,641 --> 01:40:05,530
voted discrepancies that ideologically 
are,

2090
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:09,930
are,
are letting themselves be shot in public

2091
01:40:09,931 --> 01:40:13,190
squares because they're demonstrating.
That's intense.

2092
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:14,790
Yeah.
It's incredible.

2093
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:17,760
It's,
I mean there's,

2094
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:18,653
there's pockets of the world that are 
living a sophisticated version of the 

2095
01:40:22,201 --> 01:40:24,270
way people were living six,
700 years.

2096
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:26,700
Yeah.
They're just living a more sophisticated

2097
01:40:26,701 --> 01:40:28,830
version of using cell phones and 
technology,

2098
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:29,783
but they have almost the same mindset as
people who lived hundreds and hundreds 

2099
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:33,054
of years ago for good and for bad.
They found an uncontacted tribe in the 

2100
01:40:37,081 --> 01:40:37,591
Amazon.
Oh,

2101
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:39,030
I saw that.
Saw the pictures.

2102
01:40:39,031 --> 01:40:40,890
Holy Shit.
We were talking.

2103
01:40:40,940 --> 01:40:41,773
We were trying to figure out where like 
imagine if there was a way where you 

2104
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:48,090
could infiltrate those people,
but they wouldn't let.

2105
01:40:48,091 --> 01:40:49,680
You would have to.
They would not.

2106
01:40:49,980 --> 01:40:53,770
The only way to really know how they 
lived would be to become one of them.

2107
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:54,130
Like

2108
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:54,963
you really couldn't figure out how they 
lived by you going in there as Greg 

2109
01:40:58,210 --> 01:40:59,540
Fitzsimmons because they would go,
whoa,

2110
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:01,750
what the fuck is this?
You have clothes,

2111
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:03,460
like,
what's that thing on your wrist?

2112
01:41:03,490 --> 01:41:06,790
It tells the time why.
Why do you need to know what time it is?

2113
01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:07,840
I do.
It would be.

2114
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:08,913
It would be amazing,
but you would be to affected like you 

2115
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,330
would.
You would affect them rather,

2116
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:16,600
whereas I think you might kill them 
because very often people,

2117
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:17,633
people,
anthropologist tried to go in there and 

2118
01:41:18,731 --> 01:41:21,850
study and they give them a disease and 
they wiped.

2119
01:41:21,860 --> 01:41:22,693
They've,
there's been cases where they wiped out 

2120
01:41:23,951 --> 01:41:25,420
entire tribes.
Yeah.

2121
01:41:25,421 --> 01:41:26,130
There's a guy named

2122
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:28,340
Dan Flores who's,
um,

2123
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:30,860
he wrote a paper about,
um,

2124
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:35,670
the bisons and a bison diplomacy bison 
ecology,

2125
01:41:35,671 --> 01:41:36,504
I think it's called.
And one of the things he was talking 

2126
01:41:38,011 --> 01:41:38,844
about was the amount of native Americans
that were wiped out just because of 

2127
01:41:43,441 --> 01:41:47,070
diseases by settlers.
And it was some insane number,

2128
01:41:47,071 --> 01:41:49,500
like high 80 percent.
Oh,

2129
01:41:49,501 --> 01:41:51,000
down in Mexico,
that was,

2130
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,073
I don't know where it was,
but what percentage of native Americans 

2131
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:58,380
Google this,
what percentage of native Americans

2132
01:41:59,010 --> 01:41:59,843
where

2133
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:04,750
killed by diseases from European 
settlers,

2134
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,140
because I know the Spanish,
when they,

2135
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:09,380
when they came into Central America,
they fucking so many

2136
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:10,840
people died.
Diseases.

2137
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:12,243
Well,
he was equating it to the boom and the 

2138
01:42:13,571 --> 01:42:15,820
buffalo herd sizes.
Oh No,

2139
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:16,600
she was saying.
Yeah,

2140
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:20,230
he was saying that when the native 
Americans contacted the Europeans,

2141
01:42:20,231 --> 01:42:22,270
they got these horses from them.
Okay.

2142
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:24,610
What does it say here?
Ninety percent.

2143
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:29,920
No Shit.
When Europeans arrived carrying germs,

2144
01:42:29,921 --> 01:42:33,850
which thrived on a dense semi urban 
populations,

2145
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:36,760
the indigenous people of the Americas 
were effectively doomed.

2146
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:40,510
They had never experienced smallpox,
measles or flu before,

2147
01:42:40,511 --> 01:42:42,760
and the viruses tore through the 
continent,

2148
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:45,880
killing an estimated 90 percent of 
native Americans.

2149
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:50,930
Hey Shit.
Holy Shit.

2150
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:54,640
Sent and then we went to war against the
remaining 10 percent.

2151
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:57,670
Holy Shit.
It's located them and push them around.

2152
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:00,370
Holy Shit.
God Damn.

2153
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:02,350
And we wonder why they drink?

2154
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:05,800
Well,
I mean

2155
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:12,200
the same thing that I said about those,
that that tribe that lived in the jungle

2156
01:43:12,201 --> 01:43:13,034
like I would have,
I would love if there was a way where 

2157
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:16,064
you could somehow or another be amongst 
them without them knowing it so you 

2158
01:43:19,071 --> 01:43:19,904
could really truly see how they behave 
and exist unaffected by a person like 

2159
01:43:25,161 --> 01:43:25,994
you or personally me.
That obviously doesn't does it wasn't 

2160
01:43:27,921 --> 01:43:28,754
born there.

2161
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:31,990
There was this documentary about this 
guy from the,

2162
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:34,220
from Greenwich Village,
I think it was a gay guy,

2163
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:39,760
and he went down to this village in,
might've been Columbia and he lived with

2164
01:43:41,451 --> 01:43:46,451
them on the river for 20 years and they 
were gay.

2165
01:43:46,521 --> 01:43:48,680
The tribe was not,
their tribe wasn't gay,

2166
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:51,380
but they didn't delineate between gay 
sex,

2167
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,243
straight sex.
It was just all kind of fluidly would 

2168
01:43:53,691 --> 01:43:57,110
happen.
And so he had this boyfriend basically,

2169
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,393
but the boyfriend had a wife and kids,
but he slept with the guy for 20 years 

2170
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:05,750
and then he left and he was gone for 
like 15 years.

2171
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:07,910
I forget why he didn't go back.
Um,

2172
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:09,193
I think he didn't go back as like,
they eventually attacked him and they 

2173
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:13,010
were going to kill him.
He realized,

2174
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:13,761
oh no,
I know.

2175
01:44:13,761 --> 01:44:16,310
It was one night he realized that they 
were cannibals.

2176
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:18,260
They went and they attacked another 
tribe.

2177
01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:18,861
They,
all of a sudden,

2178
01:44:18,861 --> 01:44:21,670
one night it had never happened before 
and all of the years he was there,

2179
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:22,910
maybe,
maybe it's only 10 years.

2180
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:28,190
They all put on paints and they went to 
the next village and they killed.

2181
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:30,860
And then they ate flesh and the guy just
went,

2182
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,480
I'm fucking out of here.
Where's my,

2183
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:34,400
where's my return ticket?
And he left.

2184
01:44:35,330 --> 01:44:36,163
And so he came back to the village and 
he wrote about it and he lectured about 

2185
01:44:39,201 --> 01:44:41,060
it and then he went back like,
yeah,

2186
01:44:41,061 --> 01:44:45,260
like 15 years later he goes back,
finds the dude.

2187
01:44:45,261 --> 01:44:46,094
And this is like,
I think that I think the movie might 

2188
01:44:47,701 --> 01:44:49,310
have been called keep the river on your 
right.

2189
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,473
And he went back and he found the dude 
and they like rekindled their 

2190
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:54,610
relationship.

2191
01:44:54,610 --> 01:44:56,990
Oh my God.
It was incredible.

2192
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,960
Keep the river on your right.
I think so.

2193
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,220
I'm writing that down.
I need to see the.

2194
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:06,650
What the fuck,
dude,

2195
01:45:07,070 --> 01:45:07,903
I didn't know that the incidences of 
cannibalism were so prevalent among 

2196
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:14,480
native Americans.
They would occasionally do that.

2197
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:15,373
Like the Nez perce apparently they had 
occasionally catch people and kill them 

2198
01:45:18,261 --> 01:45:19,094
and eat them.
Yeah.

2199
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:23,000
Especially people like they'd catch you 
had your brain,

2200
01:45:23,001 --> 01:45:24,380
right,
that eat your whole body.

2201
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,260
Yeah.
But probably your brain

2202
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:27,650
do.
But think about it.

2203
01:45:27,651 --> 01:45:31,370
I mean it's very symbolic.
You conquer and you consume.

2204
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:33,410
Yeah.
But it's,

2205
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:36,020
it's the thing that freaks us out the 
most,

2206
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:40,740
the idea being just reduced to meet,
right?

2207
01:45:41,290 --> 01:45:42,123
Yeah.
And by someone just with a bigger 

2208
01:45:44,271 --> 01:45:46,040
Tomahawk,
you know.

2209
01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:46,913
So I mean,
or do to got to you before you get to 

2210
01:45:48,651 --> 01:45:51,380
him.
There's no like real serious weapons.

2211
01:45:51,550 --> 01:45:53,630
Yeah.
Bows and arrows and spears and,

2212
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:57,540
and it's really a fight to exhaustion.
See who lasts the longest

2213
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,940
mark or the capture you if you're trying
to get away from them.

2214
01:46:01,450 --> 01:46:03,110
But in their case,
I mean,

2215
01:46:03,111 --> 01:46:03,944
do you imagine if you and your people 
had lived in this one patch of land for 

2216
01:46:07,781 --> 01:46:08,890
10,000
years,

2217
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,113
then all of a sudden these fucking 
demons carrying death in their breath 

2218
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:16,383
and they're very touch.
Like just getting in contact with a 

2219
01:46:18,641 --> 01:46:23,530
makes all of your relatives wilt away,
kills 90 percent of the people you know,

2220
01:46:23,590 --> 01:46:24,423
just them being around.
Not Forget about all the shit they 

2221
01:46:26,201 --> 01:46:27,034
killed with guns.
All the people they probably shot and 

2222
01:46:29,081 --> 01:46:31,630
killed because just emanating evil and 
death.

2223
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:32,230
Think about that.

2224
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:35,770
And then they ran you up like fucking 
cattle and they rape your women.

2225
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:37,990
Jesus.
I mean,

2226
01:46:39,340 --> 01:46:41,210
enough can't be said people.
Oh,

2227
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:44,080
are already fucking liberal.
We're in about the native Americans.

2228
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:45,163
It was pretty bad.

2229
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:46,513
Well,
I didn't know how bad it was until I 

2230
01:46:48,051 --> 01:46:50,040
read a priest's account

2231
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:55,070
of Columbus is men interacting with 
native Americans and it is horrific.

2232
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:56,963
Yeah.
This a religious guy went with them on 

2233
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:00,324
one of the voyages and wrote books about
how they would hack off guys arms and 

2234
01:47:04,381 --> 01:47:05,214
they would tell them to bring them gold.
They had to bring their weight in gold 

2235
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:08,304
and if they didn't do it,
they would hack off one of their arms 

2236
01:47:09,521 --> 01:47:11,730
and they do it in front of everybody 
else to freak them out.

2237
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:12,564
And at first the natives were very 
friendly and once they realize that the 

2238
01:47:15,691 --> 01:47:18,100
natives were friendly and the natives 
were sort of weak,

2239
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:19,133
they,
they started taking advantage of them 

2240
01:47:20,311 --> 01:47:25,311
and brutalizing them and getting them to
acquire gold and they would smash babies

2241
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:28,090
on rocks like this priest.
Oh,

2242
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:30,090
it was horrible.
Horrible,

2243
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:33,660
horrible shit.
Is Priest wrote about this.

2244
01:47:33,661 --> 01:47:36,210
So when we think of Christopher 
Columbus,

2245
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:37,193
we think of this noble Spanish gentleman
who came over and landed in America and 

2246
01:47:41,251 --> 01:47:42,084
you know,
looked regal as he got off with fucking 

2247
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:47,520
rosy cheeks and walked amongst the 
people and declared this American,

2248
01:47:47,521 --> 01:47:49,620
all that bullshit and made friends with 
the Indians,

2249
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:52,710
but they were a horrible band of 
monster.

2250
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:53,633
They also stopped in the Caribbean on 
the way here and they literally 

2251
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:00,720
committed genocide on an entire fucking 
island of people.

2252
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:03,810
They work them to death.
Same thing like a lot of these people,

2253
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:04,644
gold didn't mean anything to them.
Like it was something that they used to 

2254
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:11,190
decorate or whatever,
but there was no value the way there was

2255
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:12,840
in Europe.
So they gave it to them.

2256
01:48:12,841 --> 01:48:13,261
They're like,
yeah,

2257
01:48:13,261 --> 01:48:15,600
you want the gold fucking just right 
over there and grab the gold.

2258
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,880
And then when they.
And once they took all that,

2259
01:48:17,881 --> 01:48:19,470
then they made them start working for 
it.

2260
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:22,190
And it seems like also like these tribes
that they encounter,

2261
01:48:22,191 --> 01:48:23,110
they don't,
these,

2262
01:48:23,270 --> 01:48:24,103
they don't have any concept of large 
scale slave labor like the Europeans 

2263
01:48:27,551 --> 01:48:29,320
did.
Like the Europeans were like,

2264
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,213
oh,
we'll just get you to work for us or 

2265
01:48:31,121 --> 01:48:34,420
we'll kill you like that.
I don't think that was like a thing that

2266
01:48:34,421 --> 01:48:35,254
native Americans were known for and I 
would say probably there probably are 

2267
01:48:37,721 --> 01:48:38,830
we.
What are we doing here?

2268
01:48:38,831 --> 01:48:42,010
Why we keep digging for gold?
Like what the fuck is going on here?

2269
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:45,640
Yeah.
Like they had weird concepts in terms of

2270
01:48:45,641 --> 01:48:46,474
like what is possession?
Like they didn't have the same sort of 

2271
01:48:48,761 --> 01:48:51,820
concepts of this being yours.
Like if you left something there,

2272
01:48:52,060 --> 01:48:52,893
he would just,
someone would just take it because it 

2273
01:48:54,271 --> 01:48:56,080
would do well that's the thing that I 
want.

2274
01:48:56,140 --> 01:48:56,973
It's right there.
I mean I'm just going to take that 

2275
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:58,700
stuff.
Anybody's.

2276
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:01,450
Nobody owns it.
So it confused the shit out of them when

2277
01:49:01,451 --> 01:49:05,650
they would get accused of stealing.
Like there was a whole different in,

2278
01:49:05,710 --> 01:49:08,530
in many of these inner encounters 
apparently there was a whole different,

2279
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:11,590
like not just a language barrier but a 
culture barrier.

2280
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:15,610
Like understanding what these fucking 
crazy white assholes we're doing.

2281
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:17,860
Yeah.
But the whole concept that you still see

2282
01:49:17,861 --> 01:49:18,694
in,
in a lot of like Middle Eastern 

2283
01:49:19,481 --> 01:49:20,680
countries,
which is the,

2284
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:25,390
the idea of giving to as a host,
you know when you come,

2285
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:31,240
when you come to somebody's home,
you give them your bed and you give them

2286
01:49:31,241 --> 01:49:32,074
food and date.
You would never ask them to leave as 

2287
01:49:34,391 --> 01:49:35,224
long as they want to stay.
And it's all about generosity and with 

2288
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:43,270
the western mentality is more about 
collecting and owning.

2289
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:45,680
Yeah,
it's interesting.

2290
01:49:45,681 --> 01:49:46,514
And isn't that also what we were talking
about before that a long time ago is a 

2291
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:55,120
lot like living in a place that has 
unbelievably harsh winters.

2292
01:49:55,340 --> 01:50:00,220
A long time ago you're faced with danger
all the time and you had to make bonds.

2293
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,950
They had to be important.
So like if you came over to my house,

2294
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:04,560
I'd have to think,
hey greg,

2295
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:07,390
you know,
the ship might go down one day.

2296
01:50:07,391 --> 01:50:09,340
If the ship goes down,
I'm here with you.

2297
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:12,280
You're here with me,
we're going to break bread,

2298
01:50:12,370 --> 01:50:13,780
we're going to sleep.
You sleep in my bed.

2299
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,040
I got you bro.
You're here.

2300
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:20,400
So like there was like this intense need
to form these community bonds today.

2301
01:50:21,611 --> 01:50:23,330
Nobody even knows what they're fucking 
neighbor is.

2302
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:25,690
Do you think they live like that?
A thousand years ago,

2303
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:28,090
you fucking first shore knew who that 
guy was.

2304
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:29,103
Then you for sure knew who that guy was 
and everybody would be on the lookout 

2305
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:32,464
for some people that we didn't know that
might be sneaking over the top of the 

2306
01:50:34,151 --> 01:50:35,980
hill.
There's none of that anymore.

2307
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:36,993
It's gone.

2308
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:39,550
So when you talk about gossip,
well you know,

2309
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:41,810
small towns from a long time ago,
people guy.

2310
01:50:41,811 --> 01:50:43,190
Everybody was gossiping.
Yeah.

2311
01:50:43,250 --> 01:50:44,083
You know what they were saying,
that guy's a rapist to watch out for 

2312
01:50:46,821 --> 01:50:47,960
him.
Or Hey,

2313
01:50:47,961 --> 01:50:50,000
this guy can vouch for it.
He's a good guy.

2314
01:50:50,001 --> 01:50:50,860
That's what gossip.

2315
01:50:51,330 --> 01:50:53,790
Yeah.
And you needed to know.

2316
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:57,210
You know who's a freak?
Who was fucking crazy,

2317
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,260
right?
Who's doing weird shit?

2318
01:50:58,290 --> 01:50:59,123
Hey,
who's jerking off and all the girls' 

2319
01:51:00,121 --> 01:51:00,954
shoes in the middle of the night when 
the fuck did you find the girls like 

2320
01:51:03,251 --> 01:51:04,084
doing it?
Yeah.

2321
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:06,570
The girls will like it.
You got to set separate them.

2322
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:10,230
They knew their own hut with loose door,
send them to vegas,

2323
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:14,173
just people like what we've become right
now as the people that are living here 

2324
01:51:18,301 --> 01:51:19,134
in 2016.
It's a weird process that's been going 

2325
01:51:22,021 --> 01:51:26,820
on for hundreds and hundreds of years 
and we're just at the end of it.

2326
01:51:27,180 --> 01:51:28,013
We're obviously not at the end end,
but we're at the front of the line as 

2327
01:51:30,451 --> 01:51:32,820
far as all the history of it all pushing
behind us.

2328
01:51:33,030 --> 01:51:33,863
It's hard for us to appreciate how weird
it must have been to be our parents or 

2329
01:51:37,111 --> 01:51:37,944
to be our parents.
Parents already come here from another 

2330
01:51:39,961 --> 01:51:44,961
country or to be someone who existed 
back when you only live 30 years old and

2331
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:49,050
you die of old age.
Have a heart attack at 30 or you'd catch

2332
01:51:49,051 --> 01:51:50,850
a disease or someone would shoot you in 
the Arrow.

2333
01:51:51,030 --> 01:51:51,863
That was like a giant panda brothers and
sisters died from shit like smallpox or 

2334
01:51:57,050 --> 01:51:57,883
in the balls.
Get in a boat and leave Spain and head 

2335
01:52:02,701 --> 01:52:06,330
across the fucking ocean and land in the
Bahamas.

2336
01:52:07,170 --> 01:52:09,690
Those are marauders,
those people.

2337
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:12,410
Well,
I just think about landing even even,

2338
01:52:12,490 --> 01:52:14,050
you know later to like,
you know,

2339
01:52:14,051 --> 01:52:16,900
the beginning of the 19th century when 
people were,

2340
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:18,023
um,
or the 20th century when people coming 

2341
01:52:19,271 --> 01:52:21,720
over from Europe,
you landed in,

2342
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:22,600
in,
you know,

2343
01:52:22,600 --> 01:52:23,433
Manhattan,
you've got a burlap sack with some 

2344
01:52:25,691 --> 01:52:29,470
clothes on it and an address of a 
fucking second cousin out in Brooklyn.

2345
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:33,220
You don't know how to get to Brooklyn.
You don't speak the native language.

2346
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:38,080
You speak in Italian.
Italians are fucking hated when you land

2347
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:40,480
your shit.
Nobody wants to help you.

2348
01:52:40,830 --> 01:52:43,830
People don't realize that today because 
that stigma's kind of gone away.

2349
01:52:44,130 --> 01:52:45,920
My grandfather used to about all the 
time

2350
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:46,641
because,
you know,

2351
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:47,474
he came over from Italy and my 
grandmother came over from Italy on my 

2352
01:52:49,191 --> 01:52:52,040
mom's side and they would talk about it 
all the time.

2353
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:54,680
How horrible was kids would call them 
Guinea Wasps,

2354
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:56,600
you know,
that he would be,

2355
01:52:56,601 --> 01:53:00,650
you would be treated as like a saw,
a lower level person,

2356
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:02,510
you know,
because you're Italian.

2357
01:53:02,511 --> 01:53:04,160
But then suddenly it went away.

2358
01:53:06,670 --> 01:53:11,660
Jersey shore brought a passion real 
housewives.

2359
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:13,520
They're getting lops yeah,
they,

2360
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:15,440
they're the real housewives of New 
Jersey.

2361
01:53:15,441 --> 01:53:16,480
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

2362
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:21,320
It is funny because like the Italians 
are in some ways,

2363
01:53:21,321 --> 01:53:22,570
you know,
you think about the,

2364
01:53:22,571 --> 01:53:24,050
the holy Roman Empire.
I mean,

2365
01:53:24,051 --> 01:53:28,550
you and I were both in Rome this summer 
and it's mind blowing that,

2366
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:30,740
you know,
irrigation started there.

2367
01:53:30,741 --> 01:53:33,680
Every major thing started there.
Demark.

2368
01:53:33,681 --> 01:53:35,780
Well,
I guess to her he was Greek or Roman,

2369
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:38,030
right?
Didn't they have that first?

2370
01:53:38,060 --> 01:53:38,470
Well,
who,

2371
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:39,230
who,
who,

2372
01:53:39,230 --> 01:53:43,010
who created democracy,
I think it was the Greeks.

2373
01:53:43,590 --> 01:53:46,100
That's a Greek word,
but uh,

2374
01:53:46,330 --> 01:53:49,280
but just what you get blown away by what
the Italians are capable of.

2375
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:50,114
You see the craftsmanship of marble work
in this country that the Italians 

2376
01:53:53,841 --> 01:53:55,560
brought over and the,
the,

2377
01:53:55,570 --> 01:53:59,090
the opera and,
and then you see Jersey.

2378
01:53:59,091 --> 01:53:59,924
Sure.
It's such a fucking weird dichotomy of 

2379
01:54:02,271 --> 01:54:07,271
Italians can be so fucking dumb and 
materialistic and yet they are the,

2380
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:11,540
the fucking high point of culture and 
civilization.

2381
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,500
Well,
in some ways,

2382
01:54:13,501 --> 01:54:16,230
but there were also fucking kids.
Yeah.

2383
01:54:16,260 --> 01:54:17,093
Right.
Like that's a big part of what they did 

2384
01:54:19,231 --> 01:54:20,064
to.
Yeah.

2385
01:54:20,070 --> 01:54:24,870
They did that along with make incredible
architecture.

2386
01:54:24,930 --> 01:54:26,280
Unbelievable.
Art,

2387
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:31,200
incredible buildings filled with statues
that are just beyond compare,

2388
01:54:31,550 --> 01:54:35,790
an incredible artistic expression,
but rampant kid.

2389
01:54:35,791 --> 01:54:36,624
Fuck it.

2390
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:40,551
Right?
Yeah.

2391
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:41,300
And the.
And the.

2392
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:42,740
We both grew up Catholic,
right?

2393
01:54:42,741 --> 01:54:44,510
Yeah.
I mean we knew Catholics.

2394
01:54:44,511 --> 01:54:45,830
Our family was,
were all Catholic.

2395
01:54:46,130 --> 01:54:48,230
Everyone around us was Catholic.
Yeah.

2396
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:52,340
We all knew a priest that tried to fuck 
a kid or a kid.

2397
01:54:52,460 --> 01:54:53,400
Well,
you heard about a priest.

2398
01:54:53,401 --> 01:54:54,600
You fucked a kid.
Yeah.

2399
01:54:55,110 --> 01:54:57,170
Or My,
my friend was um,

2400
01:54:57,290 --> 01:54:59,560
he went away to some fucking camp in 
this.

2401
01:54:59,590 --> 01:55:04,040
The priest like climbed into bed with 
them and was trying to grab his hand and

2402
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:04,874
shove it down his pants.
And he was like literally fighting the 

2403
01:55:06,291 --> 01:55:07,970
guy off and running away from him.

2404
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:11,530
It was a crazy story.
I was like,

2405
01:55:11,531 --> 01:55:12,460
what?
Yeah,

2406
01:55:12,461 --> 01:55:13,294
the Catholics.
I think there's a work ethic that comes 

2407
01:55:15,251 --> 01:55:18,580
with it and a service of God thing and a
Christian soldier thing.

2408
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:19,713
And then there's also all the repression
and shame about sexuality that plays 

2409
01:55:22,781 --> 01:55:23,614
out.
The Irish are the same way the Irish 

2410
01:55:25,061 --> 01:55:25,894
have,
you know,

2411
01:55:25,930 --> 01:55:26,763
they saved the Bible.
There's this book called how the Irish 

2412
01:55:30,101 --> 01:55:33,910
saved civilization and when the Roman 
empire was being destroyed,

2413
01:55:34,090 --> 01:55:36,430
they were burning every single Bible in 
Europe,

2414
01:55:36,431 --> 01:55:37,264
like they literally destroyed all the 
bibles and in Ireland there were the 

2415
01:55:40,301 --> 01:55:41,980
monks that were like,
you know,

2416
01:55:41,981 --> 01:55:42,814
the,
uh,

2417
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:43,591
the,
uh,

2418
01:55:43,591 --> 01:55:47,700
what are those scrolls called in Dublin,
I'm the,

2419
01:55:47,730 --> 01:55:51,570
whatever they're called,
but they were hand writing bibles by the

2420
01:55:51,571 --> 01:55:55,950
fucking thousands and that's what saved 
Christianity.

2421
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,540
Wow.
And so,

2422
01:55:57,541 --> 01:55:59,160
and then,
then you get into the poets,

2423
01:55:59,161 --> 01:56:01,110
you know,
Yates and Eugene O'neill and,

2424
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:04,710
and you think about what the Irish have 
offered to this place,

2425
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:07,500
but the same thing.
Massive kid fuckers.

2426
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:08,960
Yeah.
It's the,

2427
01:56:08,960 --> 01:56:09,793
the,
the number of people throughout history 

2428
01:56:11,201 --> 01:56:14,290
that were kid fuckers.
That's what was really weird.

2429
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:17,260
It was like if you go through history 
and you know,

2430
01:56:17,261 --> 01:56:18,094
what would you call it,
pet arrestees that would you call it up 

2431
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:22,570
the technical word for,
is it having sex with underage boys?

2432
01:56:22,990 --> 01:56:27,990
But it's really common like,
like throughout human history throughout

2433
01:56:28,781 --> 01:56:33,781
Rome and the Middle East,
and there's so many fucking instances of

2434
01:56:34,211 --> 01:56:38,170
great men threw in.
Like it wasn't socrates a kid fucker.

2435
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:38,830
No,
yeah,

2436
01:56:38,830 --> 01:56:39,663
yeah,
yeah.

2437
01:56:39,670 --> 01:56:43,390
I mean like how many people quote 
socrates and then have that caveat,

2438
01:56:43,391 --> 01:56:45,410
but it also fucked kids.
No,

2439
01:56:45,450 --> 01:56:48,400
that's not.
That doesn't give them a pass on that.

2440
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:50,620
They didn't know you weren't supposed to
fuck kids back then.

2441
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:52,960
Cause people.
A lot of people probably fuck them too.

2442
01:56:53,470 --> 01:56:54,303
It was probably sexual exchanges were 
like we a bunch less rigid idea of what 

2443
01:56:59,411 --> 01:57:02,830
sexual exchanges were acceptable,
but that's not that long ago.

2444
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:03,773
Know.
It's weird that hundreds of years ago 

2445
01:57:05,021 --> 01:57:07,960
people were just fucking fucking animal 
before I'd fuck a kid.

2446
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:09,993
There's a lot of animals.
I think that would probably be good to 

2447
01:57:12,011 --> 01:57:12,844
fuck right.
I think a horse would probably fight 

2448
01:57:15,191 --> 01:57:17,350
back the least.
I don't know about that.

2449
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:19,150
I wouldn't fuck her horse because if 
they kick you,

2450
01:57:19,151 --> 01:57:20,650
you're dead.
That's true.

2451
01:57:20,680 --> 01:57:23,980
They decided they're done.
They're not going to be cool about it.

2452
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:25,180
That I can be like,
all right,

2453
01:57:25,181 --> 01:57:25,980
go ahead,
finish.

2454
01:57:25,980 --> 01:57:27,580
No,
they're going to take you off of him.

2455
01:57:27,980 --> 01:57:29,720
He want a fat,
lazy animal.

2456
01:57:30,050 --> 01:57:30,883
Yeah.
You don't want death by female horse or 

2457
01:57:32,821 --> 01:57:34,550
a male horse if you're into that kind of
shit.

2458
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:39,120
Probably had,
she seems she's pretty popular show.

2459
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:40,340
Yes.
Yeah,

2460
01:57:40,580 --> 01:57:42,260
that would definitely be the one,
you know,

2461
01:57:42,261 --> 01:57:43,094
it's weird that it's illegal to kill 
animals when you are going to do 

2462
01:57:48,321 --> 01:57:52,480
anything but eat them like um,
and it's illegal.

2463
01:57:52,490 --> 01:57:56,500
It's illegal to fuck animals.
Like you can't fuck them,

2464
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:58,270
but you can kill them.
Yeah,

2465
01:57:58,330 --> 01:57:59,710
you can eat them,
but you can't fuck them.

2466
01:57:59,740 --> 01:58:01,930
Yeah.
So you can't do a dual purpose.

2467
01:58:01,931 --> 01:58:03,130
You can't kill them.
Fuck them.

2468
01:58:03,131 --> 01:58:06,160
Then eat them because then you're 
fucking dead animal and that's gross.

2469
01:58:07,860 --> 01:58:10,980
Illegal.
I think it's more illegal to fuck a dead

2470
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:11,814
animal than a live animal.
That makes sense because what are you 

2471
01:58:13,831 --> 01:58:14,191
doing?
Then?

2472
01:58:14,191 --> 01:58:15,024
You're really just masturbating because 
there's not a living thing in your 

2473
01:58:16,801 --> 01:58:19,230
presence.
It can't be rape if it's debt,

2474
01:58:19,460 --> 01:58:20,293
but you notice how there's like stages 
of like how you feel about the dead 

2475
01:58:22,551 --> 01:58:24,560
animal.
There's one stage.

2476
01:58:24,561 --> 01:58:26,240
One is the live animal,
right?

2477
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:27,610
If you fucking alive,
anima,

2478
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:28,453
you crazy asshole.
What are you subject to that animal to 

2479
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:31,910
stage two,
your fucking a dead animal.

2480
01:58:31,911 --> 01:58:33,470
Like what is wrong with you?
Like why?

2481
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:34,633
Why do you want to fuck this thing?
Forget about whether you should be able 

2482
01:58:37,551 --> 01:58:40,640
to do it,
but if you kill it and then eat it,

2483
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:42,070
right,
everybody's

2484
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,140
fine with that because that's like what 
you're supposed to do,

2485
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:45,303
but you can't fuck it's body.
But what if you just jerked off with a 

2486
01:58:48,161 --> 01:58:49,890
chicken cutlet?
What if you took a chicken,

2487
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:52,690
he wrapped around your Dick and someone 
came in the room like,

2488
01:58:52,691 --> 01:58:53,920
what the fuck you doing?
Greg?

2489
01:58:53,921 --> 01:58:54,311
Like,
dude,

2490
01:58:54,311 --> 01:58:55,144
I'm telling you it sounds crazy,
but it feels so good and I just cleaned 

2491
01:58:57,341 --> 01:59:00,910
it up and then I eat it for dinner.
It takes a bite.

2492
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:04,630
What's this nice cream sauce?
Dare you.

2493
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:07,450
Now that you say fucking a chicken 
cutlet,

2494
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:10,770
it's all I can think about it because he
had slippery.

2495
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:14,650
It's soft.
When those gmo chickens would wrap right

2496
01:59:14,651 --> 01:59:19,300
around your heart and it's a breast.
You thinking about it being at your tit.

2497
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:20,213
Fucking it.

2498
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:25,090
You know what you would do?
You would take a bag,

2499
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:27,270
like a Ziploc storage bags?
Yeah,

2500
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:32,280
the chicken cutlet in the bag and then 
heat up some water to about a 99 degrees

2501
01:59:32,710 --> 01:59:37,360
and then you dunk the chicken cutlet in 
the water so that it heats up.

2502
01:59:37,390 --> 01:59:38,340
It gets,
but you know,

2503
01:59:38,350 --> 01:59:41,950
like a body skin temperature.
Then you just covered that bitch with.

2504
01:59:42,450 --> 01:59:44,260
Yeah,
just lather it in there.

2505
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:49,350
And then you put an oven Mitt on cutlet.
You wrapped that color on your shaft.

2506
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:55,290
Oh,
crimes against humanity.

2507
01:59:55,300 --> 02:00:00,300
Never felt so good and then yeah,
you can eat it.

2508
02:00:02,620 --> 02:00:05,440
You're gonna Cook that Shit because 
you've tenderized it.

2509
02:00:05,530 --> 02:00:08,350
Especially like you don't have to use in
edible oil.

2510
02:00:08,351 --> 02:00:12,280
You could jerk off with a nice avocado 
oil or coconut oil.

2511
02:00:12,540 --> 02:00:14,920
You know,
avocado oil has a high flash point.

2512
02:00:14,921 --> 02:00:17,560
It's good oil to jerk off with because 
then after you're done,

2513
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:19,510
as long as you don't come on your 
chicken.

2514
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:20,560
Oh,
you know,

2515
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:22,070
you pull out.
That's gross.

2516
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:22,923
I don't want to come on your food,
but that way it will be like really 

2517
02:00:24,551 --> 02:00:27,820
green multiple uses.
I love it.

2518
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,863
Well,
we can't accept the fact that we 

2519
02:00:29,551 --> 02:00:30,850
wouldn't.
We want pleasure.

2520
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:35,290
You know that we want pleasure from a 
fleshlight is gross.

2521
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:37,570
You want to fuck that thing?
Oh,

2522
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:38,553
that's gross.
That we want pleasure from a chicken 

2523
02:00:40,931 --> 02:00:41,764
cutlet.
Using an animal flesh as a masturbation 

2524
02:00:45,341 --> 02:00:46,174
tool will eat.
It will sink our teeth into it and 

2525
02:00:48,101 --> 02:00:53,101
swallow it belong as you interested in 
animal will eat a cow's fucking milk.

2526
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:54,790
Leave.
There's rule so we.

2527
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:55,624
Here's the rules.
According to section 69 of the sexual 

2528
02:00:57,941 --> 02:00:58,774
offenses act of 2003 69 commits,
a person commits an offense of 

2529
02:01:04,181 --> 02:01:09,181
intercourse with an animal.
If a he unintentionally or intentionally

2530
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:10,720
intentionally,
excuse me,

2531
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:14,020
performs an act of penetration which is 
penis be.

2532
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:18,070
What is penetrated is the vagina or anus
of a living animal.

2533
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:22,030
So blow jobs are afraid.
So that's not intercourse with an animal

2534
02:01:22,031 --> 02:01:25,920
and blow jobs are free.
But notice how both of them are heat.

2535
02:01:28,020 --> 02:01:32,440
You know,
to he doing it,

2536
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:35,260
they're not referring to a chick fucking
a horse.

2537
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:37,440
That chick fucking a horse seems totally
legal.

2538
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:38,920
Wouldn't be a horse.
Fucking a chick though.

2539
02:01:38,930 --> 02:01:40,010
Not the chick.
Fuck No.

2540
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:42,020
That dirty bitch.
She shows that horse what's up?

2541
02:01:42,021 --> 02:01:44,840
She backs up to them,
keeps them stuck in that stall.

2542
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:47,330
He can't back up or go forward.
It's totally against as well.

2543
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:49,570
It has to do with,
uh,

2544
02:01:49,690 --> 02:01:53,620
David Cameron and the prime minister.
I think of what the UK or Britain,

2545
02:01:53,910 --> 02:01:56,170
uh,
just just talking about if he could have

2546
02:01:56,171 --> 02:01:57,004
gotten in trouble if something happened 
with some allegations of something in 

2547
02:01:58,781 --> 02:02:02,380
some memoirs about something that I'm 
not reading all of the article.

2548
02:02:02,381 --> 02:02:03,214
I was just reading them

2549
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:06,140
his penis in a dead pig head.
He did.

2550
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:09,020
And that's what it says.
That's the allegation.

2551
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:10,950
Well,
he was in a university.

2552
02:02:11,250 --> 02:02:11,941
Oh,
so,

2553
02:02:11,941 --> 02:02:14,700
but it was breaking down if what he did 
is actually illegal or not.

2554
02:02:14,701 --> 02:02:17,610
And you,
it has to be a dead animal or this was a

2555
02:02:17,611 --> 02:02:19,200
dead animal in this court in this case.

2556
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:22,270
So for the live animal it's sex with an 
animal.

2557
02:02:22,450 --> 02:02:24,070
Yes.
So if it's dead animals,

2558
02:02:24,071 --> 02:02:24,600
no big deal.

2559
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,433
And then I broke it down that it would 
have mattered where it happened and if 

2560
02:02:28,201 --> 02:02:29,700
someone would have taken a picture of 
it,

2561
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:34,260
if there's no picture,
you're fine.

2562
02:02:34,261 --> 02:02:36,090
If it happened in public,

2563
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:37,670
you're also maybe,
okay,

2564
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:38,563
that is fucking hilarious.
How weird is it that we have rules on 

2565
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:44,750
what we allow you to fuck,
but you can kill them and eat them,

2566
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:45,673
but you can't just kill them.
You can only kill them if you're going 

2567
02:02:47,651 --> 02:02:48,484
to eat them.
If you can't just shoot a cow in the 

2568
02:02:49,951 --> 02:02:50,784
head,
leave it to rot even though that's like 

2569
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:54,620
the natural processes of animal falls 
down.

2570
02:02:54,621 --> 02:02:55,880
Cro,
start eating it.

2571
02:02:55,910 --> 02:03:00,230
Rats eating the grass devours it.
It gets,

2572
02:03:00,231 --> 02:03:02,060
you know it decays and goes into the 
ground,

2573
02:03:02,780 --> 02:03:05,160
but you can't do that.
Will shoot if you are,

2574
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:06,313
unless you strap a bit and it's mouth.
Sit on it and whip it around a fucking 

2575
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:11,030
to Deauville track.
You can do that.

2576
02:03:11,100 --> 02:03:12,530
Then he breaks his leg.
Then you can kill.

2577
02:03:12,550 --> 02:03:14,360
Shoot him in the head,
the dentist fair.

2578
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:15,253
Here we go.
Weird rules with how we interact with 

2579
02:03:16,731 --> 02:03:17,930
animals,
not.

2580
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:21,140
I'm definitely not saying you should go 
around fucking animals.

2581
02:03:21,141 --> 02:03:21,974
I'm not saying you should be able to.
I'm not saying you should hope nobody 

2582
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:25,130
interprets.
What we're saying is that.

2583
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:29,870
I'm just saying it is weird that we make
rules about things like that,

2584
02:03:29,871 --> 02:03:32,240
like who was fucking these animals to 
the point where they're like,

2585
02:03:32,241 --> 02:03:33,074
we gotta write this down.
I'm surprised there's not more animal 

2586
02:03:36,801 --> 02:03:37,634
fucking because think about how horny 
people are and you think about people 

2587
02:03:42,981 --> 02:03:45,530
that can't get laid.
Oh yeah.

2588
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:48,280
And I just.
It seems incredible to me that,

2589
02:03:48,310 --> 02:03:50,780
that you don't hear all that.
Maybe it just does.

2590
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:51,793
People don't find out maybe this more 
animal fucking going on than we really 

2591
02:03:54,411 --> 02:03:58,100
are aware of how many,
many people's lives alone with a fucking

2592
02:03:58,430 --> 02:04:00,740
giant dog.
Yeah.

2593
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:03,440
Like one of those big fucking sheep 
dogs.

2594
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,030
That's weird that a guy would live with 
that because he's fucking it.

2595
02:04:08,330 --> 02:04:10,220
Oh Greg.
That's so not true.

2596
02:04:10,221 --> 02:04:11,054
Sometimes they just have a nice pet dog 
and they love them and they give him a 

2597
02:04:13,521 --> 02:04:17,060
kiss on the face and they throw the ball
for him and he's a wonderful companion,

2598
02:04:18,170 --> 02:04:22,400
but at least a few guys are out there 
right now while I'm talking.

2599
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:25,910
Three hundred million people in this 
country plus Mexicans.

2600
02:04:26,130 --> 02:04:27,920
What's that number?
Three 50.

2601
02:04:28,010 --> 02:04:30,050
Whatever it is.
We don't even know what the number is.

2602
02:04:30,051 --> 02:04:32,450
Right,
and we don't want to say plus Mexicans.

2603
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:34,430
I'm not trying to be racist.
You're welcome here.

2604
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:36,170
I say he could stay.
That's what I was.

2605
02:04:36,171 --> 02:04:36,801
Fuck.
Yeah,

2606
02:04:36,801 --> 02:04:38,100
let stay.
She still fuck

2607
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:38,933
the animals,
but what I'm saying is at a 300 plus 

2608
02:04:41,641 --> 02:04:42,474
million people,
there's at least one person right now 

2609
02:04:43,921 --> 02:04:44,754
who has his balls covered in whip cream.
His dog is sucking on his balls and so 

2610
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:50,340
many more than that.
Yeah.

2611
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:52,530
At least one though.
He has super confident.

2612
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:54,540
Like if I had.
If they said Mr Rogan,

2613
02:04:54,541 --> 02:04:57,480
would you like to bet $10,000
on that being true?

2614
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:00,410
Yes.
Yes.

2615
02:05:00,430 --> 02:05:04,170
That's good money right now.
Out of $300 million has whipped cream on

2616
02:05:04,171 --> 02:05:06,230
his balls and he's jerking off while his
dogs looking.

2617
02:05:06,231 --> 02:05:07,061
It's not.
And then the,

2618
02:05:07,061 --> 02:05:07,894
the map.
So the spots on the map where it's 

2619
02:05:09,001 --> 02:05:11,920
happening and it would be like those 
trump states just like,

2620
02:05:11,950 --> 02:05:13,740
you know when you like,
I can't believe they're all red.

2621
02:05:13,770 --> 02:05:15,800
It'd be like that's what it'd be like.
Like,

2622
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:16,853
like the sky,
like a constellation in the entire 

2623
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:20,423
country would light up.
It'd be like 3000 people at the same 

2624
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:24,450
time.
That's too much.

2625
02:05:24,530 --> 02:05:25,530
Right?
Well,

2626
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:28,620
that's probably not happening.
It says right here that uh,

2627
02:05:29,090 --> 02:05:32,010
there's beastiality is legal in 
Kentucky,

2628
02:05:32,040 --> 02:05:33,990
Montana,
New Jersey,

2629
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,790
Nevada.
Of course,

2630
02:05:35,791 --> 02:05:39,300
Ohio.
Texas Jersey does permit civil unions.

2631
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:40,673
You can marry an animal.
You can have a civil union with your 

2632
02:05:43,351 --> 02:05:46,860
animal.
Fifty five percent of the states were in

2633
02:05:46,861 --> 02:05:49,680
beastiality is legal same sex marriage 
is not.

2634
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:53,963
Oh my God.
That's a thing that is insulting the 

2635
02:05:57,361 --> 02:05:58,194
states,
which do not criminalize beastiality 

2636
02:05:59,790 --> 02:06:03,150
yet.
Banned same sex marriages are Kentucky,

2637
02:06:03,151 --> 02:06:04,440
Montana,
New Jersey,

2638
02:06:04,441 --> 02:06:05,490
Nevada,
Ohio,

2639
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:06,480
Texas,
Virginia,

2640
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:09,540
West Virginia and Wyoming.
Holy Shit.

2641
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:14,460
They don't criminalize theology,
but they have a ban on dudes.

2642
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:15,294
Marion dudes.
Just a misdemeanor and a lot of other 

2643
02:06:17,251 --> 02:06:18,600
states too.
What if you,

2644
02:06:18,660 --> 02:06:21,270
you're a gay for a male dog,
right?

2645
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:25,560
How's that work?
I think he can't do it.

2646
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:29,250
So if you're allowed to marry a dog,
you could fuck it for sure.

2647
02:06:29,251 --> 02:06:34,251
Right now they don't have problems with 
beastiality in those towns,

2648
02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:36,690
right?
Oh No.

2649
02:06:36,691 --> 02:06:41,190
Jersey Jersey allows for a civil union 
amongst people who are gay.

2650
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:45,810
They don't allow for a civil union 
amongst you and your animal.

2651
02:06:45,930 --> 02:06:48,240
Yeah.
How dare you interpreted that way,

2652
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:50,700
but you know,
I mean,

2653
02:06:50,701 --> 02:06:51,534
how can,
how can you say that it's okay to fuck 

2654
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:54,153
animals.

2655
02:06:54,290 --> 02:06:56,970
Gay People can't get married.
That is the way.

2656
02:06:57,020 --> 02:06:59,760
The fact that we let that stay on the 
books,

2657
02:07:00,180 --> 02:07:02,370
like everybody needs to sit down and go,
what are we doing?

2658
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:03,900
Like what's this?
What does this.

2659
02:07:03,930 --> 02:07:06,360
Do you think it's okay?
Is it okay to fuck his sheep dog?

2660
02:07:06,361 --> 02:07:09,280
But these two lesbians that can't get 
married out here,

2661
02:07:09,340 --> 02:07:10,650
man,
get out of the way.

2662
02:07:10,710 --> 02:07:13,740
Boys that insult and get out of the way.
But now it's national.

2663
02:07:13,741 --> 02:07:16,350
Now gay marriage is legal in all states,
correct?

2664
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:18,750
Is it?
I think so.

2665
02:07:18,751 --> 02:07:19,584
I mean it'll be challenged once trump 
comes in is illegal and all states 

2666
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:23,430
federally.
I think it is.

2667
02:07:23,431 --> 02:07:25,800
Right?
I think that was a a year ago.

2668
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:26,693
I think it's federally illegal,
but it's the states that have issues 

2669
02:07:28,711 --> 02:07:29,610
with.
That's interesting.

2670
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:31,950
So it's like the opposite of the problem
with marijuana.

2671
02:07:32,280 --> 02:07:34,080
Marijuana being legal in a lot of 
states,

2672
02:07:34,081 --> 02:07:37,330
but federally illegal,
a weird system.

2673
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:38,463
Never get it.
That was the issue with that lady in 

2674
02:07:39,671 --> 02:07:40,600
Kentucky.
She wouldn't.

2675
02:07:40,750 --> 02:07:41,583
She wouldn't personally wouldn't issue 
the marriage license and so that's 

2676
02:07:43,741 --> 02:07:44,381
right.
You're right,

2677
02:07:44,381 --> 02:07:45,214
Jamie,
you're right.

2678
02:07:45,250 --> 02:07:47,710
Yeah.
That was that crazy lady for Jesus.

2679
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:49,023
Jesus don't want no clear cut each other
off onto the power of government and 

2680
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:57,820
they brought it to the convention.
The Republican convention.

2681
02:07:57,821 --> 02:07:59,410
She was a hero.
A goddamn here.

2682
02:07:59,411 --> 02:08:01,290
I'll pull it around.
I'm gonna.

2683
02:08:01,310 --> 02:08:03,460
You know what I love is the trump's 
inauguration.

2684
02:08:03,461 --> 02:08:05,530
He see what he's got lined up for the 
talent so far.

2685
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:09,940
Mormon Tabernacle choir and some of the 
rockettes.

2686
02:08:10,270 --> 02:08:12,700
A bunch of them won't do it,
I'm sure.

2687
02:08:12,820 --> 02:08:14,410
Meanwhile,
while the Democrats I heard,

2688
02:08:14,411 --> 02:08:16,750
I don't know,
is this confirmed that the Democrats are

2689
02:08:16,751 --> 02:08:21,751
putting on a concert that same night and
they've got springsteen Lady Gaga,

2690
02:08:23,470 --> 02:08:24,303
fucking Jay z and beyonce like literally
like 15 of the biggest names in 

2691
02:08:29,951 --> 02:08:32,230
entertain and trump is such a star 
fucker.

2692
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:33,303
This is kill it up.
How Weird the Democrats are doing 

2693
02:08:36,191 --> 02:08:38,650
something on the inauguration night like
that.

2694
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:40,600
Why did that?
Maybe it's not that night,

2695
02:08:40,601 --> 02:08:43,360
but it's around then maybe they're 
trying to fuck with them.

2696
02:08:43,930 --> 02:08:45,280
Oh yeah,
totally.

2697
02:08:45,281 --> 02:08:46,114
Fucking with them.
I think it's raising awareness that we 

2698
02:08:48,341 --> 02:08:50,620
have to stay vigilant that,
you know,

2699
02:08:50,770 --> 02:08:52,750
I don't think we should shut down 
government,

2700
02:08:53,950 --> 02:08:58,360
but I think that we should make sure 
that the constitution is being honored.

2701
02:08:59,200 --> 02:09:01,540
That's the big question right now.
How,

2702
02:09:02,200 --> 02:09:05,020
how does a guy go from being a reality 
star to being the president?

2703
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:09,370
I mean,
it's almost beyond imagination,

2704
02:09:10,130 --> 02:09:14,440
like the fact that it's real and I keep 
opening up CNN everyday going,

2705
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:16,380
oh yeah,
everyday,

2706
02:09:16,620 --> 02:09:18,310
everyday I'll go to CNN.com.
I go,

2707
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:19,443
Oh yeah,
yeah,

2708
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:21,460
he's the guy.
Oh yeah.

2709
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,593
Oh yeah.
He Won.

2710
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:27,360
Now that bit you did about it last night
about how we just wanted a fuck.

2711
02:09:28,010 --> 02:09:29,750
Oh Damn.
Don't give a away.

2712
02:09:29,770 --> 02:09:31,930
I'm still working on.
Supposedly this was called the.

2713
02:09:31,931 --> 02:09:33,910
We have the people concert,
but I'm not seeing.

2714
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:36,410
There's no tickets for sale right now.
Uh,

2715
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,600
we,
the people for trump.

2716
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:39,810
No,
this a democratic concept.

2717
02:09:41,260 --> 02:09:44,330
Supposedly.
There's rumors that a promoter was going

2718
02:09:44,331 --> 02:09:46,560
to book it.
Is it called a clock of cooks?

2719
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:49,910
A class?
This is a clean.

2720
02:09:49,950 --> 02:09:51,850
According to politico,
this was gonna happen,

2721
02:09:51,851 --> 02:09:54,070
but cucs or anybody who supports 
Hillary.

2722
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:58,920
A cook is cuckold like a guy who.
I mean,

2723
02:09:58,921 --> 02:10:01,450
it's not just that.
It's like has been cheated on her cook.

2724
02:10:01,810 --> 02:10:03,310
If you're a,
if you're white knighting,

2725
02:10:03,311 --> 02:10:06,130
you're a cook.
Like it's a new alt right.

2726
02:10:06,131 --> 02:10:07,600
Speak.
No,

2727
02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:10,960
she came out of the originally from the 
porn,

2728
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:12,263
a phrase cuckold in,
which is like a guy fucks your wife in 

2729
02:10:15,041 --> 02:10:17,560
front of you and you'll go like some 
guys like watching.

2730
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:19,630
Oh No,
it goes back to Shakespeare.

2731
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:21,580
Yeah.
But they,

2732
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:25,270
they changed it.
But how is it that they're maligning her

2733
02:10:25,271 --> 02:10:29,830
for her husband cheating when trump has 
had three wives.

2734
02:10:29,950 --> 02:10:31,350
But wait a minute.
Who's,

2735
02:10:31,410 --> 02:10:33,500
who's the deed?
All right.

2736
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:34,980
Isn't that a big generalization?

2737
02:10:35,650 --> 02:10:37,330
Well,
they went after they brought,

2738
02:10:37,331 --> 02:10:39,070
they brought out,
uh,

2739
02:10:39,071 --> 02:10:44,071
all of all of Clinton's ex mistresses at
the Republican convention.

2740
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:45,811
Well,
what's that?

2741
02:10:45,811 --> 02:10:46,644
All people that he allegedly sexually 
assaulted this a little stronger than 

2742
02:10:48,781 --> 02:10:50,390
just mistresses.
Um,

2743
02:10:50,730 --> 02:10:53,010
I think it's probably a combination.
It's the best stuff.

2744
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:53,933
I think the all stars,
there were women that were accusing him 

2745
02:10:55,831 --> 02:10:56,760
of rape,
weren't they?

2746
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:59,490
Were they all?
I think so.

2747
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:02,250
It was in the or accusing him of sexual 
assault and weren't.

2748
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:04,560
That wasn't.
That was the big deal was it wasn't just

2749
02:11:04,561 --> 02:11:06,320
that he had affairs with these women.
Yeah,

2750
02:11:06,390 --> 02:11:08,310
it was that.
There was like some allegations,

2751
02:11:08,820 --> 02:11:11,460
right?
It's all.

2752
02:11:11,890 --> 02:11:13,320
Yeah.
I think that's what it was,

2753
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:14,273
but it is amazing how much that was used
against her list of sexual advances and 

2754
02:11:18,030 --> 02:11:20,700
things like that.
Sexual advances is,

2755
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:23,390
in my opinion,
very different than sexual assault.

2756
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:24,520
Groping,
groping,

2757
02:11:24,570 --> 02:11:25,950
okay.
Forcibly kissing.

2758
02:11:26,190 --> 02:11:28,380
So when you say sexual advances,
like it's always like,

2759
02:11:28,381 --> 02:11:30,000
what does that mean?
Does he talk to her?

2760
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:33,150
Probably like grabbing pussies.
How dare you,

2761
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,360
how dare you.

2762
02:11:38,060 --> 02:11:41,460
What is weird is that you know,
without permission,

2763
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:44,100
and again,
I'm not defending trump on this one,

2764
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:48,480
but the first move your first move,
you can either go,

2765
02:11:48,481 --> 02:11:51,430
you can go hard or you can be Johnny 
Gentlemen.

2766
02:11:52,020 --> 02:11:53,820
You know,
and not too many guys are saying,

2767
02:11:53,821 --> 02:11:54,654
may I kiss you?
You usually just go in and try to kiss 

2768
02:11:56,641 --> 02:11:57,570
somebody.
Right?

2769
02:11:57,571 --> 02:11:59,790
Which is what he did.
Not only that,

2770
02:12:00,330 --> 02:12:03,720
can you go in and grab a woman's Vagina 
as your first move?

2771
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:04,673
Can you cut the third?
Can you steal first and second and go 

2772
02:12:06,421 --> 02:12:08,520
right to third.
Who says you can't?

2773
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:10,860
Well,
if it worked,

2774
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,870
it will be a fucking bold move.

2775
02:12:13,150 --> 02:12:16,480
Didn't he say they let you.
Wasn't that one of the sun?

2776
02:12:17,230 --> 02:12:20,080
Yes.
And he's talking about crazy groupies.

2777
02:12:20,110 --> 02:12:22,360
I don't want to defend it because this 
is a way to do it.

2778
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:23,343
Like if you're sitting,
like I remember when I was a teenager 

2779
02:12:25,301 --> 02:12:27,700
there was a girl driving a car and I 
didn't know her that well,

2780
02:12:27,970 --> 02:12:32,290
but we were like 16 or 17 and while she 
was driving I put my hand.

2781
02:12:32,291 --> 02:12:33,124
There were like three kids in the back 
and everybody's getting high and I put 

2782
02:12:36,161 --> 02:12:38,650
my hand on her knee and I kind of worked
at.

2783
02:12:38,830 --> 02:12:41,320
I worked at down the thigh slowly,
slowly.

2784
02:12:41,710 --> 02:12:43,420
Is it okay not saying it,
but it's,

2785
02:12:43,630 --> 02:12:44,800
it's dark,
it's quiet.

2786
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:46,360
And I got,
I got to her,

2787
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:50,050
I got her vagina and I massaged it while
she drove.

2788
02:12:51,190 --> 02:12:55,150
And then we got to where we're going.
I got out of the car and I never saw her

2789
02:12:55,151 --> 02:13:00,151
again.
Was that in fact Joe Rogan immoral?

2790
02:13:01,790 --> 02:13:03,820
Not In my eyes.
Um,

2791
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:07,940
girls like boys and boys like girls,
she might've called her friends over and

2792
02:13:07,941 --> 02:13:08,571
going,
dude,

2793
02:13:08,571 --> 02:13:10,880
check this out.
This do fingered me all the way.

2794
02:13:10,881 --> 02:13:13,520
Home was awesome.
And I went home and finished.

2795
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:15,890
Ooh,
maybe she knows she finished.

2796
02:13:15,891 --> 02:13:18,560
What does he get home to grab them by 
the pussy quote.

2797
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:19,713
What?
He said your girl's hot as shit in the 

2798
02:13:21,951 --> 02:13:23,240
purple.
Says Bush.

2799
02:13:23,241 --> 02:13:24,074
Now coast host of NBC today show I got 
to use some tic tacs just in case I 

2800
02:13:27,231 --> 02:13:28,760
start kissing her.
Trump says.

2801
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:32,130
And when you're a star,
they let you do it.

2802
02:13:32,790 --> 02:13:34,470
Trump says,
grab them by the Pussy.

2803
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:37,140
Trump says you can do anything.
He's being funny.

2804
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,330
You know,
it's unfortunate that,

2805
02:13:39,331 --> 02:13:41,220
that,
that's,

2806
02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:44,250
you know,
when people like making this,

2807
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:47,990
this thing about it being a locker room 
talk is inexcusable.

2808
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:48,833
You can't say it's locker room talk like
it can't expect someone's words when 

2809
02:13:53,761 --> 02:13:54,594
it's two guys talking shit to each other
like that to be transferred literally 

2810
02:13:58,890 --> 02:13:59,880
onto like a,
uh,

2811
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:00,743
like when you're reading it,
you're reading it out and you're not 

2812
02:14:02,611 --> 02:14:03,444
taking into account.
There are two guys sitting next to each 

2813
02:14:04,951 --> 02:14:05,784
other on the bus talking shit being 
funny and that one of them is a fucking 

2814
02:14:09,301 --> 02:14:10,134
renowned entertainer and his whole thing
is about him being this braggadocious 

2815
02:14:15,391 --> 02:14:17,460
winter and uh,
he's,

2816
02:14:17,670 --> 02:14:21,570
he's obviously playing it up and he's 
playing it up to an audience of one,

2817
02:14:21,571 --> 02:14:22,404
not to audience of 80 million or however
many people found out about it or more 

2818
02:14:25,841 --> 02:14:27,360
or whatever the hell it was that read 
that.

2819
02:14:27,910 --> 02:14:32,050
But can you see that as a,
as sort of an insight into his character

2820
02:14:32,051 --> 02:14:32,884
in terms of showing women from a power 
structure of him having the power in 

2821
02:14:36,071 --> 02:14:36,904
them not.
And will that affect how he leads the 

2822
02:14:38,861 --> 02:14:39,940
country?
For sure.

2823
02:14:40,490 --> 02:14:45,490
That is absolutely a way to look at it.
Another way to look at it is he was used

2824
02:14:45,711 --> 02:14:50,600
to groupies that wanted to do and a lot 
of them probably did.

2825
02:14:50,601 --> 02:14:53,090
I think when you're a fucking 
billionaire,

2826
02:14:53,150 --> 02:14:55,100
when you're powerful,
forget the money.

2827
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:58,610
Yeah,
but he's also a multibillionaire.

2828
02:14:58,611 --> 02:15:03,260
He has many billions of dollars.
The type of gold digging holes,

2829
02:15:03,261 --> 02:15:05,510
the muzzle launch themselves in his 
direction.

2830
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:09,620
I mean it must be like they must have to
fight them off like,

2831
02:15:09,710 --> 02:15:11,690
like the,
the hoard and Lord of the rings.

2832
02:15:11,691 --> 02:15:14,320
Just fucking attorney.
I mean,

2833
02:15:14,510 --> 02:15:15,343
he's worth a lot of fucking money.
A Gal could just sneak in and take a 

2834
02:15:18,351 --> 02:15:19,184
piece of that.

2835
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:21,980
You think he's peeled off a million here
and there for women.

2836
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:24,660
It wouldn't hurt them.
Think it wouldn't hurt them.

2837
02:15:25,200 --> 02:15:28,350
Maybe take,
get some nice good at a gift shop.

2838
02:15:28,351 --> 02:15:30,390
Get yourself settled.
He does not.

2839
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:35,560
He's not a Marauder of business marauder
because just because he likes money.

2840
02:15:36,350 --> 02:15:37,183
Like he likes the whole thing.
He likes all of the above and that's 

2841
02:15:40,471 --> 02:15:43,350
part of all of the above,
of the massive success.

2842
02:15:43,560 --> 02:15:45,570
He can do whatever he wants.
He flies in his jet.

2843
02:15:45,571 --> 02:15:48,210
He's got billions of dollars.
Got this super hot wife,

2844
02:15:48,240 --> 02:15:49,073
he's like,
he's,

2845
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:51,780
he's the president of the United States.
Now he's doing what I mean,

2846
02:15:51,781 --> 02:15:55,050
that's standard for his operational 
procedure.

2847
02:15:55,051 --> 02:15:56,430
He does whatever the fuck he want.

2848
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:57,913
Well,
it's kind of animalistic because if you 

2849
02:15:59,241 --> 02:16:00,860
think about it,
you know the,

2850
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:02,083
the re procreating is the most important
thing and you get to do that as a male 

2851
02:16:06,861 --> 02:16:09,860
when you are the most powerful.
So in the animal kingdom,

2852
02:16:10,190 --> 02:16:13,820
all that,
everything translates into being able to

2853
02:16:13,821 --> 02:16:16,700
fuck the female.
And so for a guy like that,

2854
02:16:17,090 --> 02:16:17,923
you know,
to be the most powerful man in his own 

2855
02:16:19,371 --> 02:16:21,700
mind means this despoiled

2856
02:16:21,860 --> 02:16:23,570
yeah,
the winner goes the spoils.

2857
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:27,500
Plus he's heterosexual.
It's just that boils it down.

2858
02:16:27,620 --> 02:16:32,620
Heterosexual man with a massive amount 
of money and power and you know,

2859
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:35,410
and now he's the president with the 
fuck.

2860
02:16:36,160 --> 02:16:38,140
We'll see what happens.
It's going to be interesting.

2861
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:39,193
The interesting thing to me is now 
there's a guy who has been literally 

2862
02:16:43,271 --> 02:16:45,280
paying off politicians for the longest 
time,

2863
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:47,890
right?
Giving massive campaign contributions.

2864
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:48,873
Now he's the president himself.
What's he going to do when it gets in 

2865
02:16:51,371 --> 02:16:51,821
there?
I mean,

2866
02:16:51,821 --> 02:16:52,654
he's even talked himself about how the 
electoral college is stupid and he's 

2867
02:16:55,781 --> 02:16:56,171
like,
yeah,

2868
02:16:56,171 --> 02:16:58,000
well we probably should go to the 
popular vote.

2869
02:16:58,390 --> 02:17:00,670
He goes,
that would be a different race though.

2870
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:01,563
I didn't try to win the race,
like saying that she won the electoral 

2871
02:17:04,480 --> 02:17:05,313
vote or that she won the popular vote,
but he won the electoral college vote 

2872
02:17:08,801 --> 02:17:12,160
and she won the popular vote by many 
hundreds of thousands.

2873
02:17:12,810 --> 02:17:15,950
Three was he drew three or 4 million

2874
02:17:16,230 --> 02:17:18,290
case.
Like he was saying,

2875
02:17:18,291 --> 02:17:21,140
well that's a different race.
Like you could do a popular vote.

2876
02:17:21,141 --> 02:17:23,180
He goes,
it actually be an easier race,

2877
02:17:23,630 --> 02:17:24,463
but it's a different race.
Like if you want to win the electoral 

2878
02:17:25,851 --> 02:17:27,140
college,
you got to win those states.

2879
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:28,123
It's just how it goes.
And he figured it out and he did it and 

2880
02:17:29,931 --> 02:17:33,880
she even avoided those states to Bill 
Clinton's fucking angst.

2881
02:17:33,890 --> 02:17:34,723
Apparently he was furious that there's 
some story that he threw a cell phone 

2882
02:17:37,131 --> 02:17:39,380
down and he was yelling at her,
you got to go to these places.

2883
02:17:39,590 --> 02:17:40,720
You've got a campaign.
He was.

2884
02:17:40,820 --> 02:17:42,200
She was like,
those aren't my people.

2885
02:17:42,500 --> 02:17:44,870
Like too many liberals thought they had 
it in the bag.

2886
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:46,190
Too many liberals thought,
well,

2887
02:17:46,191 --> 02:17:49,010
everybody thinks the way I think and 
everybody I know thinks this.

2888
02:17:49,070 --> 02:17:52,670
Trump can be president.
There's people just all throughout those

2889
02:17:52,671 --> 02:17:57,140
cornfields just was so happy,
so happy when he got an office man.

2890
02:17:57,470 --> 02:17:59,360
There's a lot of instagram posts that I 
follow.

2891
02:17:59,600 --> 02:18:00,433
Instagram pages.
You go to people's pages and it's all 

2892
02:18:02,480 --> 02:18:06,200
Hashtag Maga.
Hashtag make America great again.

2893
02:18:07,370 --> 02:18:09,410
He gives me my pickup truck and my make 
America.

2894
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:12,360
I would have talked to every one of 
those motherfuckers in two years.

2895
02:18:12,361 --> 02:18:13,194
I want to talk to all of you face to 
face and how do you account for 

2896
02:18:16,051 --> 02:18:16,884
yourself.
Don't say that because then they're 

2897
02:18:18,211 --> 02:18:19,044
going to blame the liberals and you're a
part of the liberal conspiracy and the 

2898
02:18:21,361 --> 02:18:22,194
reason why trump wasn't successful 
because the liberal back Congress tried 

2899
02:18:25,971 --> 02:18:29,190
to interrupt the power structure.
Liberals don't back Congress.

2900
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:30,780
Trump,
listen man,

2901
02:18:30,781 --> 02:18:33,540
I know how it works.
[inaudible] DOT com.

2902
02:18:34,050 --> 02:18:39,050
I'll fucking tell you right now.
The Republicans have the right idea.

2903
02:18:39,470 --> 02:18:44,470
If he is not successful.
He's got the Senate and Congress and the

2904
02:18:45,690 --> 02:18:48,480
Supreme Court and the Uber Guide,
the gubernatorial control.

2905
02:18:48,570 --> 02:18:50,860
He's got it all.
That's Chris's agenda,

2906
02:18:50,861 --> 02:18:53,490
doesn't go through.
He cannot blame liberals.

2907
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:58,260
I'm hoping with great sincerity that we 
slowly phase out.

2908
02:18:58,261 --> 02:18:59,094
The idea of having one individual 
president I think is ridiculous and I 

2909
02:19:02,941 --> 02:19:03,774
think it goes back to the ancient 
fucking primates and their alpha male 

2910
02:19:06,631 --> 02:19:07,464
king.
I think families occupy that one thrown 

2911
02:19:12,840 --> 02:19:14,760
too many people.
Too many bushes,

2912
02:19:14,790 --> 02:19:16,650
too many Clinton's.
Just stop,

2913
02:19:16,980 --> 02:19:20,490
stop and would.
If Donald Trump wins and then you know,

2914
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:22,350
few years down the road,
his son gets in,

2915
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:24,630
what if they're the next empire?
That easily could happen.

2916
02:19:24,690 --> 02:19:25,523
Yeah,
I know.

2917
02:19:25,530 --> 02:19:27,150
You never know.
It's.

2918
02:19:27,470 --> 02:19:28,520
The idea

2919
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:29,503
was great when we first started.
The idea was great to have one person 

2920
02:19:32,421 --> 02:19:34,910
who is really exceptional and have that 
one person lead,

2921
02:19:35,300 --> 02:19:36,133
but I think at this point in time,
the collective strength of human beings 

2922
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:41,540
has been demonstrated really clearly in 
this world.

2923
02:19:42,020 --> 02:19:45,440
The collective strength is far greater 
when everyone contributes,

2924
02:19:45,830 --> 02:19:46,663
when it's a collective group of minds 
thinking and communicating about things 

2925
02:19:50,691 --> 02:19:51,530
and people go,
oh well,

2926
02:19:51,531 --> 02:19:52,364
you know,
everybody's going to want their way and 

2927
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:56,300
we have to realize like what's the right
way?

2928
02:19:56,480 --> 02:19:57,313
Like there's too much debate back and 
forth about what's the left and what's 

2929
02:19:59,631 --> 02:20:01,700
the right,
what's the healthy way,

2930
02:20:01,701 --> 02:20:02,534
what's the,
what's the correct way for like the 

2931
02:20:05,070 --> 02:20:05,903
society to be even and smooth and your 
kids be able to walk to school in the 

2932
02:20:09,621 --> 02:20:11,990
morning without worrying about someone 
taking them and eating them.

2933
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:14,870
You know,
like there was this fucking guy,

2934
02:20:14,871 --> 02:20:15,704
Jordan Peterson that I had on recently.
It was talking about these posters that 

2935
02:20:18,231 --> 02:20:20,950
they put up in Russia in the 19 thirties
saying don't eat

2936
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:21,913
children

2937
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:28,470
who's talking about Marxism and 
communism and where,

2938
02:20:28,500 --> 02:20:32,900
where can go awful and where a lot of 
these ridiculous posturing intellectuals

2939
02:20:32,901 --> 02:20:33,734
that claimed to be Marxist,
they don't understand the consequences 

2940
02:20:35,061 --> 02:20:37,730
of Marxism and he does really,
really well.

2941
02:20:38,030 --> 02:20:38,780
And so,
you know,

2942
02:20:38,780 --> 02:20:39,613
you talked about the Gulag archipelago 
and reading about all the different 

2943
02:20:41,481 --> 02:20:42,314
things that had happened to people that 
had become indoctrinated into these 

2944
02:20:46,521 --> 02:20:47,354
ideologies and then started carrying out
these horrific crimes in the name of 

2945
02:20:50,421 --> 02:20:51,440
them.
And fuck,

2946
02:20:51,441 --> 02:20:52,274
it's terrifying.
Finding all the people who died because 

2947
02:20:53,991 --> 02:20:54,870
of communism.
Like,

2948
02:20:55,850 --> 02:20:56,683
like we look at human history,
it's just a bunch of people getting 

2949
02:20:58,191 --> 02:20:59,024
jacked.

2950
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:01,210
Well wait,
so you're saying that there shouldn't be

2951
02:21:01,211 --> 02:21:02,044
a strong leader?
Are there shit because Marxism is 

2952
02:21:03,341 --> 02:21:04,170
without a strong

2953
02:21:04,170 --> 02:21:05,003
later then?
Well I don't think there should be one 

2954
02:21:06,901 --> 02:21:09,660
person,
but I think we should figure out who the

2955
02:21:09,661 --> 02:21:14,661
top minds as far as people that want to 
contribute who the top minds are and vet

2956
02:21:14,851 --> 02:21:19,110
them out and have a whole goddamn panel 
of people like,

2957
02:21:19,870 --> 02:21:20,740
you know,
like what,

2958
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:23,520
what superhero movies would they go to?
Like A,

2959
02:21:24,040 --> 02:21:27,020
like Captain America,
a council of elders or something.

2960
02:21:27,180 --> 02:21:28,080
Right.
You know,

2961
02:21:28,190 --> 02:21:29,023
we always have the hose,
we have a bunch of wise men sitting 

2962
02:21:30,841 --> 02:21:32,400
around there would be glowing from 
behind,

2963
02:21:32,610 --> 02:21:34,230
like some thor type shit.
Right?

2964
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:35,910
It's literally what we need.

2965
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:38,910
But the elders is the problem because a 
lot,

2966
02:21:38,911 --> 02:21:42,510
a lot of times these oligarchies become 
old people.

2967
02:21:42,540 --> 02:21:44,850
Like,
like Congress before,

2968
02:21:44,851 --> 02:21:48,540
before Johnson came in,
Congress was literally seniority.

2969
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:52,470
Every committee in Congress was based on
seniority.

2970
02:21:52,471 --> 02:21:53,304
The oldest motherfucker ran things and 
so crazy and it was crazy and it gets 

2971
02:21:58,260 --> 02:22:00,420
totally backlogged.
Any legislation.

2972
02:22:00,421 --> 02:22:02,370
And he came in and he,
he broke that up.

2973
02:22:02,371 --> 02:22:05,340
So he's alive the longest.
He knows the old ways,

2974
02:22:05,370 --> 02:22:06,350
right?
Right.

2975
02:22:06,850 --> 02:22:09,180
The old ways we will continue the old 
words.

2976
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,000
Yeah.
Put your powdered wig on.

2977
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:14,810
How long were you away from that?
How long ago was the powdered wig?

2978
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:17,420
Two hundred years ago.
The day.

2979
02:22:17,421 --> 02:22:19,460
Whether it was like,
what the fuck are we doing?

2980
02:22:20,480 --> 02:22:23,720
I'm not wearing the wig bro.
I'm not wearing the fucking wig.

2981
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,980
Like what day?
I should bring it back.

2982
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,420
Fuck it.
My hair fell out.

2983
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:28,890
I'm gone.
Powdered we'll with you.

2984
02:22:29,130 --> 02:22:30,590
What?
The comedy store you,

2985
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:34,230
you and me.
Fanny fanny packs right here,

2986
02:22:34,240 --> 02:22:35,580
dude.
Right there on that.

2987
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:36,720
That's right.
I,

2988
02:22:36,890 --> 02:22:39,870
I wear mine all the time and my son gave
me shit about it.

2989
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:42,580
And then guess what?
Six months later he's dead.

2990
02:22:42,650 --> 02:22:44,320
He's still got that fanny pack.
What?

2991
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:45,810
He's wearing those.
I'll get 'em one.

2992
02:22:46,200 --> 02:22:47,340
Yeah,
I've got some.

2993
02:22:47,350 --> 02:22:49,330
My higher primate ones.
Ones.

2994
02:22:49,410 --> 02:22:50,500
I'll give you one of those.
Hey,

2995
02:22:50,510 --> 02:22:51,450
I wear it all the time.

2996
02:22:51,450 --> 02:22:53,880
That's what I'm saying.
I'll praise be to dice clay.

2997
02:22:54,370 --> 02:22:55,950
He started.
He told me about it.

2998
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:56,431
Yeah.
Well,

2999
02:22:56,431 --> 02:22:58,800
I always wore war fanny packs.
I'd been wearing fanny packs forever,

3000
02:22:58,801 --> 02:23:00,970
but they were crappy and then dice clay 
came in.

3001
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:01,833
I went,
what is this exceptional piece of 

3002
02:23:02,701 --> 02:23:04,680
hardware you have around your waist?
It was like,

3003
02:23:04,681 --> 02:23:05,570
oh,
you'll like this.

3004
02:23:06,420 --> 02:23:08,970
Oh yes.
It's from roots.

3005
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:09,900
Roots,
roots.

3006
02:23:09,940 --> 02:23:12,510
His fanny pack.
It's fucking beautiful.

3007
02:23:12,511 --> 02:23:16,170
The way it clips together,
it's like it's perfect size or hate shit

3008
02:23:16,171 --> 02:23:19,280
in my pockets.
Transmit phone year.

3009
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:22,590
I take everything out of my pockets 
wherever I go and I lose shit.

3010
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,500
Shorts don't shut.
It was nothing in my pockets.

3011
02:23:26,060 --> 02:23:27,780
A little man bag.
That's it.

3012
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:31,590
I wore a fanny pack this morning.
I got a sports one because I ran.

3013
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:32,453
Ooh.
Those are good and I put it around my 

3014
02:23:33,541 --> 02:23:36,150
waist.
A little sports once.

3015
02:23:36,670 --> 02:23:38,670
Oh yeah.
Oh by the way,

3016
02:23:38,671 --> 02:23:40,380
shit my pants while running this 
morning.

3017
02:23:41,430 --> 02:23:42,860
Not Hard,
just a.

3018
02:23:43,050 --> 02:23:45,060
It was a shark.
I was coming up the hill.

3019
02:23:45,630 --> 02:23:47,320
I was,
I was in mile for,

3020
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:48,683
had nothing left and I and I thought I 
had to fart and just Bam shirt and my 

3021
02:23:53,071 --> 02:23:54,960
underwear.
I did that the other day in my house.

3022
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:55,883
Yeah,
just a little squirt and what she's as 

3023
02:23:58,021 --> 02:23:58,854
Christ feels like such a failure,
but it had some good farts before the 

3024
02:24:02,310 --> 02:24:03,140
problem.
Yeah.

3025
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:05,800
I got motivated because I had from you 
on it.

3026
02:24:06,110 --> 02:24:10,500
You were on a roll.
Rumblers was Jesus and it was just me.

3027
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:12,470
I wish I didn't have to cover them from 
nobody,

3028
02:24:12,471 --> 02:24:17,471
so I was pausing and leaning into them 
and I'm just a little fuck,

3029
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:22,290
fuck,
catch the shower.

3030
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:24,420
That's a shower.
But it was really interesting because as

3031
02:24:24,421 --> 02:24:25,254
soon as I got on the bowl,
all of a sudden I had explosive 

3032
02:24:27,661 --> 02:24:28,470
diarrhea.

3033
02:24:28,470 --> 02:24:29,760
I'm like,
where was this?

3034
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:30,893
Like?
I had no idea that some diarrhea was 

3035
02:24:33,211 --> 02:24:34,044
looming.
Meanwhile that's holiday eating 

3036
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:37,770
probably.
Yeah.

3037
02:24:37,800 --> 02:24:38,633
Well dreams and shit was also.
I go off the Diet and I started eating 

3038
02:24:41,191 --> 02:24:45,000
like Pumpkin Pie and ice cream and she 
did all the cream.

3039
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,490
Yeah,
with a lot of bread.

3040
02:24:47,491 --> 02:24:49,410
I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
last night,

3041
02:24:50,760 --> 02:24:51,593
but as the ultimate failure,
because your job as a human is to 

3042
02:24:54,151 --> 02:24:56,270
provide for your family and not shit 
your pants.

3043
02:24:57,150 --> 02:25:00,120
You think about it all the time.
Every time you fart,

3044
02:25:00,300 --> 02:25:00,840
you,
you.

3045
02:25:00,840 --> 02:25:03,150
There's a little moment where you weigh 
in on it.

3046
02:25:03,660 --> 02:25:06,150
You feel it out,
feel your intestines,

3047
02:25:06,151 --> 02:25:06,984
you fill your anus,
you make a judgment call and you let it 

3048
02:25:09,091 --> 02:25:10,140
rip.
What's interesting,

3049
02:25:10,141 --> 02:25:10,974
if you think about how tuned in you are 
to the sensations you get from your 

3050
02:25:14,461 --> 02:25:16,920
inner colon,
because there's times you know like,

3051
02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:18,660
oh no,
I'm about to shit my pants.

3052
02:25:18,890 --> 02:25:19,723
There's like A.
There's a certain alarm that goes off 

3053
02:25:21,570 --> 02:25:23,560
like when you're like,
oh no,

3054
02:25:23,561 --> 02:25:24,250
no,
we're concerned

3055
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:25,330
a little too hard here.
Okay,

3056
02:25:25,331 --> 02:25:27,160
we've got a problem here boys.
We got a runner.

3057
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,113
We got to.
It

3058
02:25:31,780 --> 02:25:32,613
just barely keep it in their closing 
rates going up and down and it's the 

3059
02:25:39,571 --> 02:25:40,790
same exact

3060
02:25:40,830 --> 02:25:43,080
feeling that you get is when you're 
trying to hold common.

3061
02:25:43,370 --> 02:25:46,420
You know that Domo.
Yeah,

3062
02:25:46,770 --> 02:25:50,340
like superbad and clamping everything in
like that.

3063
02:25:50,341 --> 02:25:52,410
I've,
I've always say one day I'm going to try

3064
02:25:52,411 --> 02:25:53,244
Tantra.
I'm going to learn how to like 

3065
02:25:54,181 --> 02:25:55,014
completely like guy said that you can 
have like an internal orgasm for your 

3066
02:25:58,230 --> 02:26:00,690
contractions so long that you come,
but no come,

3067
02:26:00,691 --> 02:26:01,524
comes out and your body just reabsorbs 
it and it makes you like Super Sayan 

3068
02:26:04,090 --> 02:26:04,520
power.

3069
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:06,710
Yeah.
I've choked one back.

3070
02:26:07,220 --> 02:26:09,830
Wow.
I just got to grab the base right before

3071
02:26:09,831 --> 02:26:10,511
impact.
And so what?

3072
02:26:10,511 --> 02:26:11,344
He's really hard.
It's got to be long enough where it 

3073
02:26:12,531 --> 02:26:13,364
begins,
but not so long that it comes out and 

3074
02:26:14,811 --> 02:26:18,080
I've pushed it back in again.
But what if you cause an injury?

3075
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:19,280
Yeah,
that's the problem.

3076
02:26:19,310 --> 02:26:21,320
What have you get crazy and you just 
really grab it.

3077
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:23,330
Why?
I've only done it a couple times.

3078
02:26:24,140 --> 02:26:26,570
Mop broke your own Dick because you 
grabbed it too hard.

3079
02:26:27,770 --> 02:26:30,170
God Damn.
Life would not be worth living.

3080
02:26:30,171 --> 02:26:31,004
Can you imagine that?
Not Having your Dick come anymore for 

3081
02:26:32,691 --> 02:26:34,730
the rest of your life and knowing that

3082
02:26:35,740 --> 02:26:40,740
what percentage of your life revolves 
around getting rid of come once a day.

3083
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:42,010
Okay.
But once a day.

3084
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:45,340
So if it's once a day,
if it's even 45 minutes of your time,

3085
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:48,610
the other 23 hours and 15 minutes are 
bullshit.

3086
02:26:49,240 --> 02:26:51,490
You thinking like,
this is what I can't lose.

3087
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:52,593
I can't lose

3088
02:26:55,830 --> 02:26:57,030
embarrassing.
Myself.

3089
02:26:57,040 --> 02:26:57,873
Said to a lot of guys like if you had to
choose between being blind or having 

3090
02:27:00,841 --> 02:27:03,720
your Dick break where you can ever get 
it up again.

3091
02:27:03,780 --> 02:27:06,330
Oh no question.
What would you say?

3092
02:27:06,390 --> 02:27:07,950
Give me the fucking stick and the dog.

3093
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:17,840
Give me this tv one,
two glasses.

3094
02:27:21,060 --> 02:27:23,690
Various to possession

3095
02:27:24,860 --> 02:27:26,990
and he's getting laid after the show.

3096
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:28,210
Man.
I was uh,

3097
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:31,120
driving last night and I was listening 
to that song.

3098
02:27:31,150 --> 02:27:31,983
You know,
sometimes you go through your phone and 

3099
02:27:33,671 --> 02:27:37,030
you're a look at an itunes,
like recently added like,

3100
02:27:37,031 --> 02:27:38,200
Oh yeah,
I forgot I bought this.

3101
02:27:38,490 --> 02:27:39,323
I listen to some old school stevie 
wonder's superstitious song I listened 

3102
02:27:42,371 --> 02:27:45,790
to like three times in a row last night.
Coming home from the comedy store,

3103
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:48,500
it's like God damn that song was.

3104
02:27:48,810 --> 02:27:52,080
Yeah,
he made some of the great.

3105
02:27:52,081 --> 02:27:57,030
I mean just anytime somebody can take 
soul and funk and bring it together.

3106
02:27:57,031 --> 02:27:58,920
That to me is like,
we were talking about it last night.

3107
02:27:58,921 --> 02:28:02,490
I was talking to Dean del Ray about soul
and fucking earth,

3108
02:28:02,491 --> 02:28:04,990
wind and fire and uh,
uh,

3109
02:28:05,050 --> 02:28:05,881
who did I listened to you?
Yeah.

3110
02:28:05,881 --> 02:28:06,714
So sly and the family stone when you get
them when they're pound in that fucking 

3111
02:28:09,841 --> 02:28:14,340
base and get little little fucking fast 
guitar going.

3112
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:15,713
Yeah man.

3113
02:28:17,350 --> 02:28:22,310
But I don't know.
I mean there was an amazing time

3114
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,910
of music and like the sixties and 
seventies,

3115
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:27,313
like sometimes I wonder if we have so 
much music that we're constantly 

3116
02:28:31,341 --> 02:28:32,174
cranking out.
Like how many people go back and check 

3117
02:28:35,331 --> 02:28:38,400
out some of the old site,
how much great shit just got Kinda Ms.

3118
02:28:38,590 --> 02:28:39,990
misplaced,
misplaced last year.

3119
02:28:40,060 --> 02:28:42,430
Bruno Mars is bringing back that sound a
lot.

3120
02:28:42,431 --> 02:28:44,920
He does some cool shit that's got that 
sound.

3121
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:47,770
He's got some great shit.
Childish Gambino album.

3122
02:28:47,771 --> 02:28:50,620
I think I've mentioned it to you.
It's almost like a funk album now.

3123
02:28:50,650 --> 02:28:51,483
Really.
People were expecting a hip hop album 

3124
02:28:52,871 --> 02:28:54,130
from because that's what he does 
usually,

3125
02:28:54,131 --> 02:28:58,840
but it's a lot of like funkadelic will 
basically what you're describing.

3126
02:28:59,330 --> 02:29:00,190
Yeah,
that's really good.

3127
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:02,340
We sober,
that's the concert.

3128
02:29:02,350 --> 02:29:05,860
Did the 1200 milligrams of edibles for.
But I,

3129
02:29:06,130 --> 02:29:08,590
I got the CD recently.
I bought it for my mom for Christmas.

3130
02:29:08,591 --> 02:29:11,590
Do you understand what he just said?
Twelve hundred milligrams of edibles.

3131
02:29:11,591 --> 02:29:12,820
He did.
How much?

3132
02:29:12,850 --> 02:29:15,670
How much is a gummy bear?
I like 20.

3133
02:29:15,740 --> 02:29:18,490
Oh fuck.
Up At old Brownie.

3134
02:29:18,491 --> 02:29:20,770
That was a thousand because I knew it 
was going to be a crazy concert.

3135
02:29:20,771 --> 02:29:23,290
They did this three d experience,
so I was.

3136
02:29:23,291 --> 02:29:24,124
I was going to go in and fight at any 
point or it was all was waiting for it 

3137
02:29:27,911 --> 02:29:29,530
to hit it never hit.

3138
02:29:29,670 --> 02:29:30,600
See.
Here's the deal.

3139
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:33,690
Jamie has some weird constitution were 
edible.

3140
02:29:33,691 --> 02:29:35,850
Weed doesn't work on him.
Wow.

3141
02:29:35,940 --> 02:29:38,160
Yeah.
Agent ever hit?

3142
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:40,170
I don't.
I don't think so.

3143
02:29:40,230 --> 02:29:40,790
Oh,
he was.

3144
02:29:40,790 --> 02:29:42,570
He's always a little high.
That's the problem.

3145
02:29:42,740 --> 02:29:45,660
It was like his,
his constitution is like a dude who's on

3146
02:29:45,661 --> 02:29:46,494
a low dose of edibles all the time.
So I think when you give Jamie a high 

3147
02:29:49,561 --> 02:29:51,230
dose of vegetables,
his body goes,

3148
02:29:51,460 --> 02:29:54,630
I know want to do with this and your 
body just clears it out of the way.

3149
02:29:54,730 --> 02:29:56,310
Interesting.
It doesn't work on him.

3150
02:29:56,340 --> 02:29:57,173
He's an alien.

3151
02:29:58,570 --> 02:30:00,160
I don't know what to do.
He'll be fine.

3152
02:30:00,220 --> 02:30:03,820
Take more than Joey Diaz.
He's given me plenty and I've done it.

3153
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,950
I like I,
he gave me 800 during a show when he was

3154
02:30:05,951 --> 02:30:09,190
on here and I didn't know whatever.
Nothing happened.

3155
02:30:09,220 --> 02:30:10,570
Yeah.
He never gets too high.

3156
02:30:10,730 --> 02:30:12,010
But.
But here's the thing.

3157
02:30:12,011 --> 02:30:15,250
He gets high when he smokes it.
Super.

3158
02:30:15,300 --> 02:30:16,970
You have to smoke a lot to get high.
No,

3159
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:17,813
not necessarily.

3160
02:30:18,210 --> 02:30:20,400
Totally normal in that regard.
Yeah.

3161
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:21,353
Like normal.
Like if we were all sitting around 

3162
02:30:22,351 --> 02:30:23,184
passing a joint,
he would hit it the same amount as 

3163
02:30:24,421 --> 02:30:25,254
everybody else would be.
Just we all be looking at each other 

3164
02:30:26,191 --> 02:30:27,024
like,
Ooh,

3165
02:30:27,570 --> 02:30:30,030
there's been many a podcast we've done 
including the beginning of this one.

3166
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:32,040
More as,
as it starts out,

3167
02:30:32,041 --> 02:30:32,581
you're like,
whoa.

3168
02:30:32,581 --> 02:30:34,470
I don't even know if I should be talking
right now.

3169
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:35,833
I'm barely holding out of the words as 
they're coming out of my mouth and 

3170
02:30:39,210 --> 02:30:43,410
forming them in the right way.
It's like their little fucking clay kids

3171
02:30:43,411 --> 02:30:45,370
that are running out of my mouth and I 
got to like form.

3172
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:46,320
All right.
Put your hat on.

3173
02:30:48,040 --> 02:30:53,040
So barbecued.
Why are you upside down this new weed?

3174
02:30:53,191 --> 02:30:56,670
It seems to be getting stronger.
This a la speed.

3175
02:30:56,671 --> 02:30:58,830
We'd like to speak.
I want to know what's going on.

3176
02:30:58,970 --> 02:31:02,670
Like since legalization hit,
it feels like the weed went up a bump,

3177
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:03,760
like pumped

3178
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:06,740
or maybe ask for less,
less than strong lead.

3179
02:31:06,741 --> 02:31:09,410
Like I wanted back in like whatever I 
was getting back in Ohio,

3180
02:31:09,411 --> 02:31:10,930
like middle,
mid,

3181
02:31:10,970 --> 02:31:13,700
we'd call mids.
I just wanted to go back to the middle.

3182
02:31:14,020 --> 02:31:15,920
He just gave me something that was like 
$5 cheaper.

3183
02:31:15,921 --> 02:31:16,221
I was like,
no,

3184
02:31:16,221 --> 02:31:18,580
that's not what I wanted.
I wanted what your shit.

3185
02:31:18,581 --> 02:31:19,620
He basically

3186
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:21,110
mild.
I don't even have it.

3187
02:31:21,400 --> 02:31:22,001
No,
you,

3188
02:31:22,001 --> 02:31:22,834
you just got to take a little baby hits.
But the problem is everybody likes 

3189
02:31:25,111 --> 02:31:27,420
taking a couple of hits.
I that's part of the fun.

3190
02:31:27,700 --> 02:31:28,533
She'll take a couple hits,
but like last night at the comedy store 

3191
02:31:31,871 --> 02:31:34,170
I went way too far.
Way Too.

3192
02:31:34,220 --> 02:31:35,490
How many hits is that?
I only.

3193
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:36,383
I never get.
I try not to get too high before the 

3194
02:31:37,921 --> 02:31:40,440
show,
like I never get as high as I got before

3195
02:31:40,441 --> 02:31:41,274
this show.
Before I stand up show I'd like to be 

3196
02:31:43,020 --> 02:31:43,853
right where I am now,
where I was high a couple of hours ago 

3197
02:31:45,990 --> 02:31:48,660
and then go on stage if that's the way,
the best way to do it.

3198
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:51,750
But afterwards everybody was just 
passing joints around.

3199
02:31:51,751 --> 02:31:52,584
It's just since it's legal now,
everybody just goes out and they're all 

3200
02:31:54,571 --> 02:31:55,770
just passing joints.
Hey man,

3201
02:31:55,771 --> 02:31:56,710
he wants some of this.
Oh,

3202
02:31:56,711 --> 02:31:59,550
well fuck it.
And Ron White with his contraptions.

3203
02:31:59,850 --> 02:32:02,010
He's got the fucking pen.
He's got a joint.

3204
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:03,990
He's got his own Tequila and a cigar.

3205
02:32:06,430 --> 02:32:08,460
It's hilarious.
Who drove him home?

3206
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,080
I don't know.
Somebody did.

3207
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:13,140
I don't know what happened last night,
but uh,

3208
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:14,490
he was talking about how he left.
Hey,

3209
02:32:14,491 --> 02:32:18,030
I'll just left my truck back here,
came back and got it.

3210
02:32:19,310 --> 02:32:20,880
It's an animal.
We need more people.

3211
02:32:20,881 --> 02:32:24,690
I can see the last of the Mohicans 
constitution.

3212
02:32:24,691 --> 02:32:26,580
My Dad had that constitution,
you know,

3213
02:32:26,581 --> 02:32:29,880
they got John Wayne apparently would be 
the last guy drinking.

3214
02:32:29,970 --> 02:32:30,803
Then I'd be an a drank whiskey and he'd 
be the first guy on set and he was on 

3215
02:32:34,291 --> 02:32:35,910
point for everything.
If you were late.

3216
02:32:36,180 --> 02:32:37,350
He was like,
what the fuck?

3217
02:32:37,440 --> 02:32:40,830
I got a buddy of mine who's a firearms 
enthusiast in Vegas.

3218
02:32:41,070 --> 02:32:44,520
My buddy named Justin Justin.
Justin's a legit giant.

3219
02:32:44,521 --> 02:32:45,354
He's like seven feet tall,
300 pounds a gun nut and he can put the 

3220
02:32:50,941 --> 02:32:53,910
booze away like nobody's business.
First of all,

3221
02:32:53,911 --> 02:32:58,320
he's a legitimate hundred pounds bigger 
than me and so I can't compete with them

3222
02:32:58,321 --> 02:33:00,570
just liver wise,
just like volume wise.

3223
02:33:00,570 --> 02:33:03,090
He's just way bigger.
His body just burns through it.

3224
02:33:03,110 --> 02:33:03,841
Come on,
dude.

3225
02:33:03,841 --> 02:33:05,070
We're drinking.
He just,

3226
02:33:05,071 --> 02:33:08,310
he's just,
he's way too big and experienced.

3227
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:10,260
He just puts it away.
What does he drink?

3228
02:33:11,010 --> 02:33:14,430
Um,
makers and coke always makers and coke.

3229
02:33:14,820 --> 02:33:16,620
Always makers and cover.
You know what together you don't have to

3230
02:33:16,621 --> 02:33:17,520
ask.
There is right there.

3231
02:33:18,350 --> 02:33:20,280
And if he gets a meal,
the CFDA.

3232
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:22,940
Wow.
Legit giant.

3233
02:33:23,310 --> 02:33:25,470
He's the sweetest guy in the world to 
super,

3234
02:33:25,471 --> 02:33:26,770
super good dude.
So he's.

3235
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:29,340
He's in for two entrees at a meal.
Oh Dude.

3236
02:33:29,341 --> 02:33:30,174
We feast in Vegas.
You go to that place was the place he 

3237
02:33:32,221 --> 02:33:34,080
told me that the Brazilian place he took
me.

3238
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:35,130
Oh,
Fogo de Chao.

3239
02:33:35,160 --> 02:33:36,760
Did you guys go there and we'd been to 
Texas?

3240
02:33:37,390 --> 02:33:39,030
Yeah,
we go to,

3241
02:33:39,031 --> 02:33:41,460
um,
there's a bunch of good steak houses,

3242
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:46,110
like a craft steak strip steak.
One of them's the MGM and one of them is

3243
02:33:46,111 --> 02:33:46,650
at Mandalay.

3244
02:33:46,650 --> 02:33:49,470
I always forget which one's which crafts
steak is mgm.

3245
02:33:49,471 --> 02:33:52,470
Right?
That one's dish is one at the palm,

3246
02:33:52,471 --> 02:33:53,420
I think.
Called nine.

3247
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:55,140
So good.
Yeah.

3248
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:56,670
Yeah.
That place is amazing.

3249
02:33:57,240 --> 02:33:59,010
That plays amazing.
Pick UFC this weekend,

3250
02:33:59,011 --> 02:34:01,200
dude,
after 11 tomorrow.

3251
02:34:01,380 --> 02:34:02,080
How are you?
See?

3252
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:03,300
Yeah.
You'll see this weekend.

3253
02:34:03,510 --> 02:34:05,230
New Year's Eve?
No,

3254
02:34:05,270 --> 02:34:08,010
it's the day before New Year's Eve to 
not compete with new years eve.

3255
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:11,210
It's the 30th,
so it's Friday night because,

3256
02:34:11,250 --> 02:34:12,660
which is super,
super rare.

3257
02:34:12,930 --> 02:34:15,710
And it's the return of Ronda Rousey.
Wow.

3258
02:34:15,711 --> 02:34:16,340
Yeah,
that's good.

3259
02:34:16,340 --> 02:34:18,580
She's fine.
Just fighting the champion.

3260
02:34:18,610 --> 02:34:21,610
Amanda Nunez,
very intense match up.

3261
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:24,190
Run around.
He had been trained like a fucking demon

3262
02:34:24,191 --> 02:34:25,300
man.
It's crazy.

3263
02:34:25,301 --> 02:34:26,134
It's kind of frightening.
So are you doing to share while you're 

3264
02:34:28,151 --> 02:34:28,841
out there?
No,

3265
02:34:28,841 --> 02:34:31,390
not this time.
Just hanging out.

3266
02:34:31,570 --> 02:34:33,910
Just gonna hang out with some friends 
are in town.

3267
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:36,720
I don't want to always do shows like,
uh,

3268
02:34:36,790 --> 02:34:38,850
tomorrow night I'm going to work out 
with mark [inaudible].

3269
02:34:39,370 --> 02:34:40,203
So a kickboxing trainer.
That's a real good buddy of mine that 

3270
02:34:42,191 --> 02:34:43,900
works in the UFC and he's going to be 
there.

3271
02:34:43,901 --> 02:34:44,734
So we'll do the weigh ins,
go get something to eat and go to the 

3272
02:34:46,841 --> 02:34:48,820
gym,
go wax and pads around.

3273
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:50,680
It's fun.
Just relax.

3274
02:34:50,760 --> 02:34:55,390
You take the weekend off because I can 
come in to read the weigh ins on the one

3275
02:34:55,391 --> 02:34:58,150
day which this way usually it's Friday,
but it be Thursday now.

3276
02:34:58,600 --> 02:35:01,190
Then the fights are on Friday night.
And then d,

3277
02:35:01,210 --> 02:35:04,330
do you do much prep?
You have to like review stats and stuff?

3278
02:35:04,360 --> 02:35:06,880
Most of the prep I do,
I just do naturally,

3279
02:35:06,910 --> 02:35:07,743
believe it or not because I'm just 
curious about the fights because I know 

3280
02:35:09,461 --> 02:35:12,120
they're coming up.
So like we did a breakdown show on,

3281
02:35:12,121 --> 02:35:13,690
um,
Monday.

3282
02:35:13,730 --> 02:35:15,130
Yeah,
on Monday we did a breakdown show.

3283
02:35:15,131 --> 02:35:18,580
We went over the card and I'll do more 
of that on my own,

3284
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:21,900
but it's not like anybody asked me to do
it and it's not like I'm,

3285
02:35:22,180 --> 02:35:23,500
I'm doing it because I want to do it.

3286
02:35:23,800 --> 02:35:24,633
I do.
I'm doing it because it enhances my 

3287
02:35:25,631 --> 02:35:28,810
appreciation of the fights.
Find out a little bit about each dude,

3288
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:30,820
watch a few of his old fights go,
Ooh,

3289
02:35:30,821 --> 02:35:32,920
I like how he does this or look how she 
does that.

3290
02:35:32,921 --> 02:35:34,510
Or Oh,
this guy's got a good one,

3291
02:35:34,511 --> 02:35:35,590
good position.
Like if you get,

3292
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:37,340
he gets you in this position.
He finished his guys.

3293
02:35:38,050 --> 02:35:40,480
So it's fun to do it from that 
perspective.

3294
02:35:40,660 --> 02:35:42,400
So then when I'm watching the fight,
um,

3295
02:35:42,410 --> 02:35:43,243
I've,
I've got a kind of an understanding of 

3296
02:35:44,291 --> 02:35:45,880
how,
at least how they used to move,

3297
02:35:45,881 --> 02:35:47,290
you know,
six months ago or a year ago.

3298
02:35:48,190 --> 02:35:51,610
People get better quick too is the other
weird thing about this world.

3299
02:35:52,090 --> 02:35:52,923
The MMA world is changing so fast.
The like the level of athlete is moving 

3300
02:35:55,931 --> 02:35:56,764
in such a fast direction.
These guys keep getting better and 

3301
02:35:58,301 --> 02:36:01,330
better and better and better and better 
and they're all getting better,

3302
02:36:01,331 --> 02:36:02,164
so it's hard to tell,
but when you can pair like a top level 

3303
02:36:04,811 --> 02:36:07,630
athlete of today versus a top level 
athlete have,

3304
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:09,340
you know,
20 years ago,

3305
02:36:09,341 --> 02:36:12,790
that's when you see these stark gigantic
differences.

3306
02:36:13,180 --> 02:36:14,013
You know,
when the UFC started in [inaudible] 93 

3307
02:36:15,341 --> 02:36:19,690
in comparison to 2016,
it's just stark crazy differences,

3308
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:23,170
which you're not going to see guys stay 
at the top as long you think,

3309
02:36:23,350 --> 02:36:25,420
well,
some guys or some girls can,

3310
02:36:25,421 --> 02:36:26,740
you know,
depending on how good they are,

3311
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:29,860
some people just have massive advantages
that are very difficult to overcome.

3312
02:36:30,040 --> 02:36:31,750
Like Anderson Silva,
when he was in his prime,

3313
02:36:32,230 --> 02:36:33,063
Anderson Silva had a massive advantage 
in timing and speed and creativity and 

3314
02:36:36,671 --> 02:36:37,504
striking.
Whereas he could defend himself on the 

3315
02:36:39,131 --> 02:36:39,964
ground.
He was difficult to take down and when 

3316
02:36:41,171 --> 02:36:42,004
he got him down,
he's pretty good defensively with his 

3317
02:36:43,001 --> 02:36:46,270
guard,
but standing up he's a goddamn genius.

3318
02:36:46,271 --> 02:36:50,130
He was a virtuoso and he would just like
move on you and do weird shit to you.

3319
02:36:50,140 --> 02:36:53,610
And then blam catch you with a front 
kick to the face or something.

3320
02:36:54,450 --> 02:36:55,283
He would time you figure you out,
find your distance and then land some 

3321
02:36:58,091 --> 02:36:59,470
crazy shit on you and fuck you up.

3322
02:36:59,470 --> 02:37:00,303
And it did it to so many people.
So when a guy like that I was at the 

3323
02:37:02,381 --> 02:37:03,214
top,
he's so truly exceptional at one 

3324
02:37:05,021 --> 02:37:07,300
particular aspect of the,
of the game.

3325
02:37:07,870 --> 02:37:09,490
A lot of times they can go on a good 
run,

3326
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:11,291
you know?
So it's,

3327
02:37:11,291 --> 02:37:12,880
it's hard.
It's hard for people to go on a run like

3328
02:37:12,881 --> 02:37:13,714
demetrius mighty mouse Johnson's 
probably on like the longest run as a 

3329
02:37:16,191 --> 02:37:20,000
champion now.
I think on the longest run the most wins

3330
02:37:20,001 --> 02:37:20,920
as a champion.
I think he's,

3331
02:37:21,290 --> 02:37:25,400
he might be like right up there with 
Anderson in the most wins.

3332
02:37:25,550 --> 02:37:26,960
And then maybe John Jones is in there 
too.

3333
02:37:27,120 --> 02:37:27,953
Wait,
is he?

3334
02:37:28,040 --> 02:37:30,320
He's the smallest guy.
He's won 25.

3335
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:32,010
He's a flyweight champion.
But he's a,

3336
02:37:32,330 --> 02:37:33,163
in my opinion,
he's the best pound for pound guy 

3337
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:36,103
because if you look at like,
he's definitely smaller than the other 

3338
02:37:38,391 --> 02:37:39,224
guys.
He couldn't move differently because 

3339
02:37:39,981 --> 02:37:42,020
he's not so way down by gravity.

3340
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:42,853
So it's,
it's very difficult to like look at his 

3341
02:37:44,151 --> 02:37:47,680
movements and say,
well you could compare him to a guy like

3342
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:49,580
for Overdo,
it was 240 pounds,

3343
02:37:49,581 --> 02:37:52,550
like for Breesa was just more hampered 
down by gravity.

3344
02:37:52,551 --> 02:37:55,100
Like his body just has to push around so
much more.

3345
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:56,113
There's no way he can move with the kind
of fluidity that I got like mighty 

3346
02:37:58,491 --> 02:37:59,324
mouse,
Ken.

3347
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:02,600
And what's the biggest guy?
That mighty mouse will fight?

3348
02:38:02,630 --> 02:38:03,463
Anderson Silva 10 fight win streak.
And Demetrius Johnson is at eight right 

3349
02:38:06,321 --> 02:38:08,570
below George St Pierre,
which is at nine at night now.

3350
02:38:08,571 --> 02:38:10,310
I think this is as of July.
Oh okay.

3351
02:38:10,490 --> 02:38:12,440
So Demetrius defended his title again 
recently.

3352
02:38:12,441 --> 02:38:14,570
So he's tied with George St Pierre for 
second place.

3353
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:18,260
So that's like a guy like Anderson.
Perfect example,

3354
02:38:18,261 --> 02:38:19,700
super tough.
John Jones,

3355
02:38:19,710 --> 02:38:20,930
another one.
Perfect example.

3356
02:38:20,931 --> 02:38:21,764
Jon Jones is a ridiculously talented 
athlete and so like when you have these 

3357
02:38:25,041 --> 02:38:25,874
like really,
really talented guys like extreme 

3358
02:38:27,231 --> 02:38:28,370
outliers,
they,

3359
02:38:28,371 --> 02:38:31,430
they tend to be able to go on roles also
because when you fight them,

3360
02:38:31,431 --> 02:38:32,264
it's terrifying because you know,
you're stepping in there with the Alpha 

3361
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:35,653
who's stepping in there with Anderson 
Silva and his prime and he bows to you 

3362
02:38:37,761 --> 02:38:39,230
and you're like,
oh my God,

3363
02:38:39,231 --> 02:38:40,970
what the fuck have I gotten myself into?

3364
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:43,190
You know?
Yeah,

3365
02:38:43,220 --> 02:38:46,070
you can pump yourself up for it and get 
yourself thinking like,

3366
02:38:46,190 --> 02:38:47,023
I'm the fucking man now.
But like when you actually across the 

3367
02:38:49,041 --> 02:38:52,400
street from the man and you're looking 
at each other eye to eye and you realize

3368
02:38:52,401 --> 02:38:56,780
like that's Anderson motherfucking Silva
and I'm about to step into the ring,

3369
02:38:57,080 --> 02:39:00,170
step into the octagon rather with the 
best ever.

3370
02:39:00,560 --> 02:39:02,660
He do enhanced sit on the edge of a tall
building,

3371
02:39:04,190 --> 02:39:05,023
so it's hard for them to get over that.
It takes a super strong mind just to be 

3372
02:39:08,061 --> 02:39:12,050
able to fight at your best.
Whether or not your best is good enough.

3373
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:12,973
That's another aspect of the fight.
Whether or not your best is good enough 

3374
02:39:16,011 --> 02:39:19,340
is really secondary because you're not 
going to be able to be at your best.

3375
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:22,130
You're going to be so freaked out and so
fucking nervous.

3376
02:39:22,340 --> 02:39:23,600
Your timing's going to be off.

3377
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:26,180
Your adrenaline is going to be fucking 
pumping through your veins.

3378
02:39:26,181 --> 02:39:27,014
You might get an adrenaline dump,
so you might tie her out in the second 

3379
02:39:28,641 --> 02:39:31,190
round.
You got to manage your resources.

3380
02:39:31,340 --> 02:39:35,200
You got to manage your anxiety and your 
facing a goddamned engine,

3381
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:36,223
like a real live superhero character and
he's seeing all of those weaknesses in 

3382
02:39:40,641 --> 02:39:42,410
you.
He sees everything.

3383
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:45,230
He sees everything too.
When you start moving around,

3384
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:46,513
when you would move around with them,
he had moved around with you and he 

3385
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:50,330
would see how you move,
whether they move slow,

3386
02:39:50,600 --> 02:39:51,433
like he would take his time.
He would take his time and then just 

3387
02:39:53,061 --> 02:39:55,730
open up on guys.
It's fascinating to watch him,

3388
02:39:55,731 --> 02:39:57,530
man,
because he would dissect guys.

3389
02:39:57,740 --> 02:39:58,573
You'd see him dissect and guys he'd be 
bouncing around and move and he would 

3390
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:01,724
change his footwork.
He would like throw a little fake your 

3391
02:40:03,261 --> 02:40:05,000
way and see how you react to you.

3392
02:40:05,010 --> 02:40:06,590
I could have hit you right there.
Okay,

3393
02:40:06,890 --> 02:40:07,723
I see what's going on here,
and then you do some stuff at him and 

3394
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:09,910
he's like,
no,

3395
02:40:09,910 --> 02:40:10,743
not today with that.
And you would see him doing all these 

3396
02:40:13,891 --> 02:40:14,724
calculations in his mind and setting up 
traps and then somewhere in the second 

3397
02:40:18,421 --> 02:40:21,090
round he would attack and when he was in
his prime,

3398
02:40:21,091 --> 02:40:24,360
it was just stunning to behold.
Here he is right now,

3399
02:40:24,590 --> 02:40:27,090
hood a standing in front of this guy,
hands down,

3400
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:29,140
and he just barely moves his head out of
the way.

3401
02:40:29,141 --> 02:40:29,974
It's just timing.
I'm just trying to figure out then Plop 

3402
02:40:32,100 --> 02:40:35,970
pop some with a jab and drops him.
I mean,

3403
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,730
you're watching all this in slow motion 
to unfortunately,

3404
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:40,840
but this was when he fought.
You should Okami.

3405
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:43,020
I mean he was just an assassin back 
then.

3406
02:40:43,230 --> 02:40:44,063
He was so good.
That's when he was the middleweight 

3407
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:48,990
champion and he was just a lighting 
people up in there.

3408
02:40:48,990 --> 02:40:51,140
Man,
if you're a guy guy,

3409
02:40:51,250 --> 02:40:54,300
get up because he's better on his feet.
I didn't give a fuck dude.

3410
02:40:54,450 --> 02:40:56,670
Go to Anderson Silva highlight reel.
See if you could find that.

3411
02:40:57,110 --> 02:40:57,943
He didn't give a fuck if you were on 
your feet like you were going to get 

3412
02:41:00,181 --> 02:41:02,970
knocked out against him in his prime.
That's his attitude.

3413
02:41:02,971 --> 02:41:04,620
He would stand with anybody.
I mean,

3414
02:41:04,621 --> 02:41:07,560
his standup was so exceptional,
but he's still fighting.

3415
02:41:07,710 --> 02:41:08,491
Yeah,
he's still fighting,

3416
02:41:08,491 --> 02:41:13,050
but he's 40,
40 or 41 now and that's the only fucking

3417
02:41:13,051 --> 02:41:15,000
thing in the world that's undefeated.
His father time,

3418
02:41:15,001 --> 02:41:16,200
man.
Just check this out.

3419
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:21,440
This is him when he was in his prime,
just slides out of the way and drops out

3420
02:41:21,991 --> 02:41:25,740
dude with a punch.
I mean he just had a way of moving.

3421
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:30,030
Let's just see if you have a like a 
highlight reel.

3422
02:41:30,031 --> 02:41:32,420
Not just this one fight.
Oh,

3423
02:41:32,490 --> 02:41:34,200
it's highlight tribute.
Oh,

3424
02:41:34,201 --> 02:41:35,220
okay.
I see.

3425
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:37,950
But it's just the same fight a couple 
times in a row.

3426
02:41:38,250 --> 02:41:40,950
This guy had a real good chance to get 
some travis luder.

3427
02:41:41,490 --> 02:41:42,840
There's a bunch of people that he 
fought.

3428
02:41:42,870 --> 02:41:45,630
They're showing.
He was so goddamn good.

3429
02:41:45,631 --> 02:41:48,180
That's Travis Luder caught in a triangle
getting elbowed in the head.

3430
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:54,120
He was,
at that time in particular,

3431
02:41:54,121 --> 02:41:54,954
he was the next level of striking 
because we had never seen anybody who 

3432
02:41:59,251 --> 02:42:04,251
had like real world class striking 
skills in the middleweight division like

3433
02:42:05,341 --> 02:42:06,540
Anderson did.
He just had,

3434
02:42:06,780 --> 02:42:08,560
especially in particularly in mma,
striking,

3435
02:42:08,570 --> 02:42:13,570
just grounded his balance is amazing.
While he was just exceptional,

3436
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:17,130
truly exceptional and physically strong 
for sure.

3437
02:42:17,280 --> 02:42:20,340
But the big thing about Anderson wasn't 
like how big he was.

3438
02:42:20,341 --> 02:42:23,670
It was just how,
how technical it was and how,

3439
02:42:23,671 --> 02:42:25,680
uh,
how brilliant his uh,

3440
02:42:25,681 --> 02:42:26,860
ability to,
uh,

3441
02:42:26,910 --> 02:42:27,743
figure guys out was.
This was the guy he fought named Lee 

3442
02:42:31,330 --> 02:42:32,163
Marie Lee Marie is the guy who put on 
the biggest bank robbery in the history 

3443
02:42:34,981 --> 02:42:35,814
of the great of Great Britain.
That guy stole hundreds of millions of 

3444
02:42:39,180 --> 02:42:40,013
dollars,
allegedly from a bank and is in jail I 

3445
02:42:41,971 --> 02:42:44,250
think in Morocco now because of it.
But,

3446
02:42:44,251 --> 02:42:46,970
uh,
he was an assassin to and they to meetup

3447
02:42:46,980 --> 02:42:48,660
and Anderson Silva lit them on fire.

3448
02:42:49,140 --> 02:42:51,390
Just fucked him up.
Just stood right in front of them.

3449
02:42:51,450 --> 02:42:52,770
Lead,
kick the shit out of him,

3450
02:42:52,980 --> 02:42:54,510
beat his ass,
took his best shots.

3451
02:42:54,930 --> 02:42:57,210
He was so good.
So you friends with Silva?

3452
02:42:57,420 --> 02:42:58,290
I know him,
I see him.

3453
02:42:58,291 --> 02:42:59,124
He doesn't speak English that good,
but I always give him a hug when I see 

3454
02:43:01,201 --> 02:43:02,130
him.
He's a very nice guy.

3455
02:43:02,180 --> 02:43:04,140
Yeah.
And again,

3456
02:43:04,141 --> 02:43:06,780
it's the greatest of all time if you're 
a fan of the sport in my opinion,

3457
02:43:06,781 --> 02:43:08,940
like that guy when he was in his,
like whatever.

3458
02:43:09,150 --> 02:43:12,220
There's like a few year period where 
someone exist at the highest

3459
02:43:12,220 --> 02:43:15,010
of our pms and when he was in the 
highest of our pms,

3460
02:43:15,011 --> 02:43:15,844
the argument is really between him and 
maybe fate or a million Eiko who fought 

3461
02:43:19,481 --> 02:43:21,190
in pride.
Um,

3462
02:43:21,280 --> 02:43:24,970
I think fate or is a real possibility.
Like I could,

3463
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:28,960
I definitely could see the argument that
he was number one instead of Anderson.

3464
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:30,513
But it's really like,
who the fuck knows they play on 

3465
02:43:31,810 --> 02:43:33,760
different organizations,
different people,

3466
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:34,611
you know,
I think the,

3467
02:43:34,611 --> 02:43:38,140
the talent level probably a little bit 
better in the UFC,

3468
02:43:38,141 --> 02:43:42,730
but it's arguable that it wasn't because
he was fighting cro cop in his prime and

3469
02:43:42,731 --> 02:43:43,564
Nogueira in his prime and he it fade or 
fought some of the all time greats at 

3470
02:43:47,181 --> 02:43:48,014
their best and beat them.
So it's arguable that he fought a 

3471
02:43:50,561 --> 02:43:51,394
tougher range of opponent.
So maybe it's arguable that fate or his 

3472
02:43:54,251 --> 02:43:55,084
accomplishments or more impressive 
because of the opposition he fought was 

3473
02:43:57,881 --> 02:43:59,350
bigger,
more dangerous.

3474
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:01,120
And I fought cro,
cop cro,

3475
02:44:01,121 --> 02:44:02,730
cop was just a,
an assassin,

3476
02:44:02,750 --> 02:44:03,583
just smashing people,
knocking everybody dead and he walked 

3477
02:44:05,261 --> 02:44:09,700
him down and out kickbox them mostly.
That's mostly what the fight was about.

3478
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:10,753
So when you get to know these guys,
like I'm sure you're more friendly with 

3479
02:44:13,011 --> 02:44:16,880
some than others do.
Is that hard to affect your,

3480
02:44:16,881 --> 02:44:19,350
the way you call the fights in terms of,
uh,

3481
02:44:20,140 --> 02:44:20,973
being critical?

3482
02:44:21,950 --> 02:44:23,840
It can be.
I try not to make it though.

3483
02:44:23,870 --> 02:44:28,570
I try really hard to be as objective as 
possible,

3484
02:44:28,571 --> 02:44:29,404
but what I'm saying and sometimes people
get upset like that I'm friends with 

3485
02:44:31,850 --> 02:44:32,683
because I'm talking about things that 
they're doing wrong or things that are 

3486
02:44:34,971 --> 02:44:35,804
going wrong for them and so they'll 
think that I'm rooting against them and 

3487
02:44:39,411 --> 02:44:39,801
I'm like,
look,

3488
02:44:39,801 --> 02:44:41,310
I'm not.
And they'll say something to you back.

3489
02:44:41,430 --> 02:44:42,620
Yeah,
we'll have conversations with them.

3490
02:44:42,621 --> 02:44:43,071
I'm like,
dude,

3491
02:44:43,071 --> 02:44:45,440
I am not rooting against like,
this is what I'm seeing.

3492
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:47,740
I'm seeing this like I'm seeing,
you know,

3493
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:50,510
I know you're thinking that you're 
winning this part of the fight or you're

3494
02:44:50,511 --> 02:44:53,120
thinking that I'm being hypercritical,
but I have to say it.

3495
02:44:53,121 --> 02:44:57,770
If I'm seeing it and I'm not,
I try really hard to have a point like I

3496
02:44:57,771 --> 02:44:59,270
don't want.
I'm not a critical person.

3497
02:44:59,270 --> 02:45:04,270
I'm like mocking someone for no reason 
or did a talking in a negative way about

3498
02:45:05,721 --> 02:45:08,210
their technique for no reason.
It's only because it's not,

3499
02:45:08,330 --> 02:45:09,163
it's not happening and I want everybody 
to know the momentum of the fight and 

3500
02:45:11,960 --> 02:45:14,630
also I want to know what's going on 
that's wrong.

3501
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:19,380
Like so because your,
your job as a commentator is not just to

3502
02:45:19,550 --> 02:45:22,490
to say what's happening and talk about 
what's happening,

3503
02:45:22,790 --> 02:45:23,623
but in mma it's also to explain things 
like I have to explain certain things 

3504
02:45:27,890 --> 02:45:32,480
like that are critical in a fight.
Like save someone gets kicked in the leg

3505
02:45:32,481 --> 02:45:34,400
really hard a few times.
You see them start to limp on it.

3506
02:45:34,401 --> 02:45:36,440
I have to point out that I see him 
limping now.

3507
02:45:36,441 --> 02:45:37,274
This is going to be huge issue.
If he tries to shoot in or if he wants 

3508
02:45:39,561 --> 02:45:41,630
to move away,
it's going to hinder his mobility.

3509
02:45:41,630 --> 02:45:44,120
It's a very important.
So then the people at home now they go,

3510
02:45:44,121 --> 02:45:45,410
okay,
well that makes sense.

3511
02:45:45,440 --> 02:45:46,011
Oh Yeah,
look,

3512
02:45:46,011 --> 02:45:47,600
that guy is limping.
Oh Shit.

3513
02:45:47,601 --> 02:45:49,820
He got hit in that same spot again.
Now he's on the ground again.

3514
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:50,870
Oh my God.
He can't get up.

3515
02:45:50,920 --> 02:45:52,020
I see it now.
So you know,

3516
02:45:52,350 --> 02:45:55,160
you know you're a storyteller.
You're also,

3517
02:45:55,730 --> 02:45:56,563
you're,
you're talking about a mathematical 

3518
02:45:58,281 --> 02:46:01,340
problem essentially a problem.
It's being duped out.

3519
02:46:01,760 --> 02:46:03,920
Like there's literally like force 
problem.

3520
02:46:04,190 --> 02:46:08,990
It's like this versus this and you're 
trying to get there.

3521
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:12,050
You're trying to hit harder in the 
better positions,

3522
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,003
so like the geometry of the human body,
you're trying to accelerate towards the 

3523
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:19,790
vulnerable areas and do it better.
So what are the best ways to do that?

3524
02:46:19,791 --> 02:46:23,420
And then there's a science and art 
behind doing it in the best way.

3525
02:46:23,660 --> 02:46:27,740
And it's my job to explain that science 
and art to the best.

3526
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:30,740
I can live in motion while it's all 
happening.

3527
02:46:31,180 --> 02:46:34,250
I can't be biased.
I try very hard to not be,

3528
02:46:34,600 --> 02:46:35,433
you know,
because it's really important that I 

3529
02:46:35,961 --> 02:46:36,794
point out both sides and sometimes 
people who accuse you of it and I swear 

3530
02:46:39,561 --> 02:46:40,121
to God if,
uh,

3531
02:46:40,121 --> 02:46:43,550
if you do feel that I'm doing it,
it is absolutely not intentional.

3532
02:46:43,730 --> 02:46:44,563
I try very hard to try to be as balanced
and unbiased as I can walk splaining 

3533
02:46:49,670 --> 02:46:53,150
exactly what I see playing out.
Even with my friends.

3534
02:46:53,380 --> 02:46:56,260
Like I'll see my friend getting fucked 
up and I'm like,

3535
02:46:56,261 --> 02:46:57,530
he's,
he can't drop that right hand.

3536
02:46:57,710 --> 02:46:58,543
He's driving that right hand.
The guy stepping to the right and he's 

3537
02:47:00,141 --> 02:47:01,340
going to catch them.
And then boom,

3538
02:47:01,341 --> 02:47:02,690
when they catch them,
like fuck,

3539
02:47:03,160 --> 02:47:06,080
like you see it happening sometimes 
before they can see it.

3540
02:47:06,170 --> 02:47:09,230
Does that ever affect how close you let 
yourself get to a fighter?

3541
02:47:09,260 --> 02:47:10,580
No,
no,

3542
02:47:10,670 --> 02:47:12,710
no.
I respect them all very deeply.

3543
02:47:12,800 --> 02:47:13,311
You know?
And I,

3544
02:47:13,311 --> 02:47:14,000
and I,
I,

3545
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:14,833
I'm really good friends with a lot of 
them and I want the best for all of 

3546
02:47:18,231 --> 02:47:19,550
them.
And that sounds contradictory.

3547
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:20,384
It sounds like impossible.
Like someone will think like if they 

3548
02:47:22,101 --> 02:47:25,130
fight that person and they hate that 
person and you like that person,

3549
02:47:25,131 --> 02:47:26,540
but you like them,
like you're,

3550
02:47:26,610 --> 02:47:28,360
you're a trader or something or like 
what?

3551
02:47:28,430 --> 02:47:30,920
How can you talk to that person?
How can you talk to him?

3552
02:47:31,040 --> 02:47:32,900
He's my mortal enemy,
but look,

3553
02:47:32,901 --> 02:47:33,734
man,
I hate the fact that you guys are 

3554
02:47:35,121 --> 02:47:36,860
enemies.
I don't know how much of is real,

3555
02:47:36,861 --> 02:47:40,460
how much of it you do it for press,
but I'm not happy with it.

3556
02:47:40,520 --> 02:47:42,770
But I liked the guy.
He's a good guy.

3557
02:47:42,820 --> 02:47:44,150
The guy.
I can be friends with,

3558
02:47:44,151 --> 02:47:45,380
somebody that you're not friends with.

3559
02:47:45,710 --> 02:47:47,340
Like if you have some guy that you don't
let,

3560
02:47:48,100 --> 02:47:49,820
you would have to have a good reason,
you know,

3561
02:47:49,821 --> 02:47:52,220
like somebody fucked you over.
I couldn't be like a competitive reason.

3562
02:47:52,221 --> 02:47:54,020
Like two guys who fought and they're 
bitter about it,

3563
02:47:54,320 --> 02:47:56,840
you know what I mean?
Like if it was like if you told me about

3564
02:47:56,841 --> 02:47:59,330
some guy fucked you over and a business 
deal or something like that,

3565
02:47:59,331 --> 02:48:00,620
I'd be like,
oh well fuck that guy.

3566
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:03,110
You know what?
That guy did something wrong.

3567
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:04,133
It's just a competitor.
Like that fucking guy I tried to follow 

3568
02:48:06,611 --> 02:48:08,420
in Miami and I bombed.
Fuck him.

3569
02:48:08,421 --> 02:48:09,260
Like,
you know,

3570
02:48:09,430 --> 02:48:10,690
like I kicked your ass.
Yeah.

3571
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:12,170
You know.
And that's with a lot of fighters,

3572
02:48:12,171 --> 02:48:13,004
they develop these very,
these deeply sort of conflicting 

3573
02:48:18,741 --> 02:48:19,574
relationships with fellow fighters.
Like you can't get too close to them 

3574
02:48:22,010 --> 02:48:23,510
because then you're going to have to 
fight them or.

3575
02:48:23,660 --> 02:48:25,400
Yeah.
Some guys don't give a fuck.

3576
02:48:25,401 --> 02:48:27,680
Some guys become friends with guys than 
wind up fighting him.

3577
02:48:28,340 --> 02:48:29,173
Oh yeah.
And is there any shay stories of that 

3578
02:48:31,041 --> 02:48:32,210
happening?
A lot of guys,

3579
02:48:32,240 --> 02:48:33,073
a lot of guys have done a lot of guys.
They started out friends and then 

3580
02:48:35,421 --> 02:48:38,310
because they had a fight each other like
Jon Jones and Rashad Evans,

3581
02:48:38,311 --> 02:48:40,910
that was a big story like Rashad Evans 
was like Jon Jones,

3582
02:48:40,911 --> 02:48:41,744
bigger older brother and they were real 
close and then when John fought for the 

3583
02:48:45,531 --> 02:48:46,364
title,
he fought for the title because Rashad 

3584
02:48:47,090 --> 02:48:50,690
was injured and John won the title.
John stepped in on short notice,

3585
02:48:50,950 --> 02:48:51,783
one the title,
and then it became a possibility of one 

3586
02:48:53,631 --> 02:48:54,464
day Rashad fighting John for the title 
and then they wound up getting super 

3587
02:48:58,671 --> 02:49:00,980
bitter about it and not liking each 
other anymore.

3588
02:49:01,030 --> 02:49:02,840
It's really,
really interesting to watch,

3589
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:06,290
but that's just one example.
There's a lot of guys who are close,

3590
02:49:06,350 --> 02:49:07,980
close guys.
They're buddies

3591
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:08,813
with each other and they get in there 
and they beat the fuck out of each 

3592
02:49:09,871 --> 02:49:10,650
other.
Yeah,

3593
02:49:10,650 --> 02:49:13,710
it's crazy and not get close.
It's like with Comedians,

3594
02:49:13,711 --> 02:49:14,544
you know,
you talked about hanging out at the 

3595
02:49:14,851 --> 02:49:15,720
store.
It's like,

3596
02:49:16,020 --> 02:49:19,500
I can't talk like somebody was telling 
me about,

3597
02:49:19,501 --> 02:49:22,140
like he hates being called a legend who 
said that.

3598
02:49:22,710 --> 02:49:24,540
I'm not gonna say Whoa,
zero legend.

3599
02:49:24,870 --> 02:49:26,880
Yeah.
Oh Dawn Gavin.

3600
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:28,820
Now,
I mean,

3601
02:49:29,070 --> 02:49:32,760
and the point was,
well I don't want to know,

3602
02:49:32,850 --> 02:49:35,280
just telling me it was Ron White,
oh ha.

3603
02:49:35,410 --> 02:49:37,700
And I and he is,
he's alleging is legit,

3604
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:38,573
but I think he got,
he got an intro of being a legend the 

3605
02:49:40,291 --> 02:49:43,320
other night you were saying to me,
I fucking hate that because you know,

3606
02:49:43,350 --> 02:49:45,510
I'm in here scrap and like everybody 
else,

3607
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:47,250
you know,
these lineups are killed.

3608
02:49:47,251 --> 02:49:48,780
Like the lineup the other night was 
like,

3609
02:49:48,990 --> 02:49:49,823
it was like Dalea and you and him and a 
nick and succeed and it's like on any 

3610
02:49:55,411 --> 02:49:56,244
given night you don't want to be called 
the legend because that's just 

3611
02:49:57,721 --> 02:50:01,140
immediately puts you on a shelf instead 
of in the fight.

3612
02:50:01,770 --> 02:50:04,830
And so anyway,
he said that to me and the reason I want

3613
02:50:04,831 --> 02:50:09,060
to say it is I could see somebody taking
that into context and going like,

3614
02:50:09,210 --> 02:50:11,010
oh,
you hate being called alleged.

3615
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:12,113
But it's like I can.
I've been called that by young comics 

3616
02:50:14,851 --> 02:50:15,684
and it's like,
don't call me a fucking legend because 

3617
02:50:18,270 --> 02:50:18,841
I,
first of all,

3618
02:50:18,841 --> 02:50:20,100
I didn't earn it.
And second of all,

3619
02:50:20,101 --> 02:50:24,300
like I'm still playing the game.
I'm still on the roster here,

3620
02:50:25,650 --> 02:50:26,483
but I was just thinking like you can't 
have that conversation with somebody 

3621
02:50:28,321 --> 02:50:32,790
who's not doing what we do because it 
would almost sound like a,

3622
02:50:33,090 --> 02:50:36,000
like you're full of yourself and it's 
same thing with fighters.

3623
02:50:36,001 --> 02:50:39,690
It's probably things that they can only 
talk to each other about that they could

3624
02:50:39,691 --> 02:50:42,630
never talk to straight people about it 
because they just haven't been there.

3625
02:50:42,900 --> 02:50:43,733
Oh for sure.
So how do you not get close to other 

3626
02:50:44,791 --> 02:50:46,650
fighters that you might have to have to 
fight one day?

3627
02:50:46,940 --> 02:50:49,020
Especially when there's a lot of guys in
the same way,

3628
02:50:49,021 --> 02:50:49,854
in the same camp,
which is very beneficial because if you 

3629
02:50:52,161 --> 02:50:52,994
get a bunch of like really good guy like
team Alpha male is a perfect example of 

3630
02:50:55,191 --> 02:50:56,024
that.
There's all these guys that are around 

3631
02:50:58,100 --> 02:51:01,160
the 135,
255 pound weight class,

3632
02:51:01,161 --> 02:51:03,500
but it's like really elite Guy in 1:25
even.

3633
02:51:03,650 --> 02:51:04,483
But a lot of elite guys in the lower 
weight classes and they all train 

3634
02:51:06,351 --> 02:51:07,580
together but they never fight each 
other.

3635
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:08,453
Yeah.
And then they had a big falling out 

3636
02:51:09,741 --> 02:51:13,310
because Tj dillashaw won the title and 
then he left team Alpha male and went to

3637
02:51:13,311 --> 02:51:15,500
Denver and now they don't like each 
other like this.

3638
02:51:15,501 --> 02:51:17,910
There's so much camaraderie and,
and,

3639
02:51:17,930 --> 02:51:18,763
and teams and,
and like there's this weird sort of 

3640
02:51:20,721 --> 02:51:21,554
tribal bond that goes with teams and the
teams that compete against other teams 

3641
02:51:25,521 --> 02:51:28,760
and they're like gangs and a lot of way,
a lot of ways,

3642
02:51:28,940 --> 02:51:31,040
but you know,
they're not,

3643
02:51:31,280 --> 02:51:32,113
they're not criminals,
they're just a bunch of dudes that are 

3644
02:51:33,651 --> 02:51:34,400
bonded together.

3645
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:38,510
And women too fucking serious hardcore 
women in the sport.

3646
02:51:38,511 --> 02:51:41,720
Now there's like Amanda Nunez,
the world champion,

3647
02:51:41,721 --> 02:51:42,554
she's the first openly gay MMA fighter.
He's a champion rather first openly gay 

3648
02:51:46,851 --> 02:51:50,690
MMA champion.
And she's the women's 135 pound fighter.

3649
02:51:50,691 --> 02:51:52,100
She's the one who's going gonna Fight 
Ronda Rousey.

3650
02:51:52,150 --> 02:51:54,320
Where is she from?
She's from Brazil.

3651
02:51:54,350 --> 02:51:57,050
That she lives in Florida.
Strains at American top team.

3652
02:51:57,051 --> 02:51:57,884
Just like the big camp.
It's like there's a few big camps all 

3653
02:52:01,911 --> 02:52:02,744
throughout the world,
but when it comes to like elite level 

3654
02:52:05,140 --> 02:52:05,973
MMA fighters,
like who's got the biggest amount of 

3655
02:52:07,511 --> 02:52:10,060
them,
it's between Jackson's in Albuquerque,

3656
02:52:10,061 --> 02:52:13,960
New Mexico and um,
Miami American top team.

3657
02:52:13,961 --> 02:52:15,880
They just have so many fucking elite 
fighters.

3658
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:17,273
Tough for her to train with people if 
she's that good to find somebody who's 

3659
02:52:20,150 --> 02:52:21,240
appear.
Now she,

3660
02:52:21,570 --> 02:52:24,670
she fucking fights with dudes.
Dudes.

3661
02:52:24,671 --> 02:52:26,230
I'm sure that a lot of them do.

3662
02:52:26,260 --> 02:52:29,650
Almost all women spar with dudes at 
least somewhat.

3663
02:52:29,950 --> 02:52:30,783
And that's the most of the dudes,
at least in high level camps are very 

3664
02:52:35,381 --> 02:52:36,760
respectful.
Like they're not,

3665
02:52:36,850 --> 02:52:38,530
they're not gonna.
Try to hurt a woman.

3666
02:52:38,970 --> 02:52:42,370
The best people in the best camps now 
realize the,

3667
02:52:42,371 --> 02:52:44,020
uh,
the damage that you take.

3668
02:52:44,080 --> 02:52:44,913
Inspiring.
It's like a frequent conversation now 

3669
02:52:46,900 --> 02:52:47,733
it's like to not spar hard.
Like sparring should almost be like 

3670
02:52:50,530 --> 02:52:53,080
technical and playing and like very 
light.

3671
02:52:53,230 --> 02:52:56,310
So you're not damaging your body,
not taking unnecessary shots.

3672
02:52:56,390 --> 02:52:58,220
Taking people to the leg.
Well,

3673
02:52:58,221 --> 02:52:59,950
you kick them a little bit in the legs.
It's not bad,

3674
02:53:00,340 --> 02:53:02,830
but the problem is the head.
That's the real problem.

3675
02:53:03,130 --> 02:53:04,690
You know,
and even kicking him in the leg,

3676
02:53:04,691 --> 02:53:06,820
there's no,
no reason to kick someone full blast.

3677
02:53:06,850 --> 02:53:08,380
You know,
you kicked the bag full blast.

3678
02:53:08,381 --> 02:53:09,910
You don't need to kick a person full 
blast.

3679
02:53:10,360 --> 02:53:11,193
And so these big teams,
the more talent you get in like one 

3680
02:53:15,431 --> 02:53:16,264
weight class,
the more you get a bunch of sharks 

3681
02:53:18,161 --> 02:53:20,900
circling the same seal or whatever the 
fuck you,

3682
02:53:21,430 --> 02:53:23,650
whatever the analogy would want.
Like you get better,

3683
02:53:23,651 --> 02:53:24,484
more competition,
you better interaction as long as 

3684
02:53:26,951 --> 02:53:28,870
there's a good comradery between all the
fighters,

3685
02:53:29,050 --> 02:53:29,883
but it's so hard to maintain.
Almost always wind up getting mad at 

3686
02:53:32,441 --> 02:53:33,274
each other.
So many fucking hit somebody after 

3687
02:53:35,291 --> 02:53:36,880
practice and some of the,
you know,

3688
02:53:36,881 --> 02:53:38,530
there's always some thing where they're 
going to have to fight.

3689
02:53:38,531 --> 02:53:41,950
Some days they talk shit to each other 
and know well also,

3690
02:53:41,951 --> 02:53:44,560
I mean I'm sure you know a lot more 
about this than I do,

3691
02:53:44,561 --> 02:53:45,394
but the people that will be drawn to a 
sport like this might be contentious 

3692
02:53:50,021 --> 02:53:50,854
people.
They might be people that have pretty 

3693
02:53:52,271 --> 02:53:53,104
good size egos and are maybe 
confrontational and so those people 

3694
02:53:57,281 --> 02:53:59,680
aren't going to necessarily always 
interact that well with others.

3695
02:53:59,710 --> 02:54:01,900
Quite a few of them for sure,
but you'd be amazed.

3696
02:54:01,901 --> 02:54:03,910
It's one of the more fascinating things 
about mma.

3697
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:06,160
You'd be amazed at how many college 
educated,

3698
02:54:06,161 --> 02:54:06,994
very reasonable rational people just 
view it as the ultimate extreme 

3699
02:54:10,511 --> 02:54:11,740
challenge.
Whether it be,

3700
02:54:11,741 --> 02:54:12,574
you know,
riding a fucking snowboard off the top 

3701
02:54:14,771 --> 02:54:17,500
of a mountain and you get dropped off in
a helicopter and you go down the side of

3702
02:54:17,501 --> 02:54:19,780
a cliff.
It's those kinds of people.

3703
02:54:19,810 --> 02:54:21,340
Yeah,
like those kinds of extreme athlete.

3704
02:54:21,341 --> 02:54:22,174
People that might've gotten into BMX 
riding or might've gotten into a lot of 

3705
02:54:24,731 --> 02:54:29,170
things that we don't think of as being 
like a violent aggressive,

3706
02:54:29,230 --> 02:54:30,063
but they're ultra risk taking sports and
the reward that comes from doing like a 

3707
02:54:34,451 --> 02:54:36,330
flip when when you're,
you know,

3708
02:54:36,370 --> 02:54:38,890
bmx jumping and you flipped through the 
air and land on your feet.

3709
02:54:39,040 --> 02:54:42,700
Like that's I'm cheating death thing.
And those same people.

3710
02:54:42,701 --> 02:54:45,430
I think a lot of like elite ones are 
getting.

3711
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:46,353
They're getting interested in possibly 
competing in MMA and taking that risk 

3712
02:54:49,840 --> 02:54:54,520
and challenging themselves in that way.
So you see a lot of very smart people,

3713
02:54:54,521 --> 02:54:55,800
man.
It's,

3714
02:54:55,870 --> 02:54:59,470
and I think that at the highest level 
you have to be smart like you.

3715
02:54:59,471 --> 02:55:00,304
We've talked to a guy like John Jones.
He might make some poor decisions with 

3716
02:55:02,531 --> 02:55:04,010
his life because parties aligned.
It's kind of

3717
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:05,720
crazy,
but he's very smart.

3718
02:55:05,990 --> 02:55:07,850
When you talked to them and you look in 
his eyes,

3719
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:08,983
you know whether or not he has access to
the same vocabulary as Christopher 

3720
02:55:11,691 --> 02:55:13,150
hitchens did.
No,

3721
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:15,410
maybe not.
But he's a fucking genius.

3722
02:55:15,411 --> 02:55:17,720
And fighting.
He knows how to figure people out.

3723
02:55:17,721 --> 02:55:20,660
He knows how to fight under pressure is 
good as anybody alive.

3724
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:23,450
And when you talk to him,
he's very engaging.

3725
02:55:23,600 --> 02:55:27,350
He's not in any way stupid.
He's a very smart guy.

3726
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:28,813
He has his interest in his focus and if 
he is his focus and his interests were 

3727
02:55:32,181 --> 02:55:33,980
an intellectual pursuits,
if he,

3728
02:55:33,990 --> 02:55:37,040
if that was really what stimulated him 
and made him want to,

3729
02:55:37,041 --> 02:55:37,730
uh,
you know,

3730
02:55:37,730 --> 02:55:39,050
to follow through on something like 
that,

3731
02:55:39,230 --> 02:55:40,540
I'm sure he'd be really good in that.
Yeah.

3732
02:55:40,900 --> 02:55:41,733
I would think it's real easy for people 
to sort of discredit someone and 

3733
02:55:45,141 --> 02:55:45,974
someone's intellectual capacity just 
because I wasn't talking about 

3734
02:55:47,751 --> 02:55:48,210
intellect.

3735
02:55:48,210 --> 02:55:50,540
I was just talking about in terms of 
Alpha status,

3736
02:55:50,541 --> 02:55:51,374
that it is hard to put a bunch of Alpha 
people near each other without a little 

3737
02:55:54,051 --> 02:55:55,400
bit of a,
you know,

3738
02:55:55,440 --> 02:55:56,750
banging elbows.
Yes.

3739
02:55:56,810 --> 02:55:57,643
But my point is that less than you would
think it would be much more comradery 

3740
02:56:02,391 --> 02:56:03,224
and much more social,
like very reasonable interaction 

3741
02:56:06,530 --> 02:56:08,600
gentlemen interaction than you would 
imagine.

3742
02:56:08,690 --> 02:56:10,060
There's much more of that.
Yeah.

3743
02:56:10,130 --> 02:56:10,963
But the problem is a guy like conor 
mcgregor comes along and he talks mad 

3744
02:56:13,581 --> 02:56:14,414
shit and he likes the world on fire and 
everybody wants to talk shit now and I 

3745
02:56:17,811 --> 02:56:18,830
get it.
I get it.

3746
02:56:18,920 --> 02:56:19,760
I mean,
it sells,

3747
02:56:19,790 --> 02:56:21,980
it sells paper view.
It's good for the sport.

3748
02:56:22,020 --> 02:56:26,140
They more money if they talk shit food.
They just released this thing on a.

3749
02:56:26,210 --> 02:56:28,550
someone did it on how much?
Conor mcgregor.

3750
02:56:28,760 --> 02:56:33,760
He sold more paper views in a year than 
the entire roster combined.

3751
02:56:36,830 --> 02:56:37,663
Wow.
You compare all the other fights of 

3752
02:56:39,951 --> 02:56:41,900
like.
I forget how it was dealt with.

3753
02:56:41,901 --> 02:56:44,150
Brendan Schaub sent it to me.
He sent it to you,

3754
02:56:44,390 --> 02:56:45,860
Jamie,
but I saw.

3755
02:56:45,910 --> 02:56:48,740
I'll try to find out what kind of money 
are we talking about.

3756
02:56:48,860 --> 02:56:50,780
I got it right here.
I don't know what he gets paid.

3757
02:56:50,810 --> 02:56:51,643
I don't under.
I don't know how much he gets per paper 

3758
02:56:53,660 --> 02:56:54,493
view,
but look at us.

3759
02:56:54,830 --> 02:56:59,210
The entire roster drew three point three
to three point two.

3760
02:56:59,300 --> 02:57:02,330
Oh,
three to three point $2 million in 2014.

3761
02:57:02,510 --> 02:57:06,170
Conor mcgregor drew double that on his 
own in 12 months.

3762
02:57:06,890 --> 02:57:07,723
Well,
GSP holds the record for the most pay 

3763
02:57:08,661 --> 02:57:12,710
per view buys in total because he had a 
lot of paper reviews more than connor.

3764
02:57:12,711 --> 02:57:14,900
Connor holds basically every other paper
view.

3765
02:57:14,901 --> 02:57:15,734
Record.
Mcgregor has drawn an insane six point 

3766
02:57:18,860 --> 02:57:22,550
eight,
5 million buys and just 15 months.

3767
02:57:22,730 --> 02:57:25,820
Holy Shit.
Wow.

3768
02:57:26,480 --> 02:57:31,480
Twice as many buys in one year than the 
entire UFC roster in 2014.

3769
02:57:31,820 --> 02:57:36,440
Just his fights.
So whereas a run see making.

3770
02:57:36,890 --> 02:57:39,410
Well that's a good question.
Like um,

3771
02:57:39,470 --> 02:57:42,850
he was saying recently that uh,
he wouldn't fight unless it's a,

3772
02:57:43,250 --> 02:57:47,660
well actually nate Diaz was saying that 
he wouldn't fight rather,

3773
02:57:47,720 --> 02:57:50,540
um,
who was his opponent in the last,

3774
02:57:51,380 --> 02:57:53,870
not this last fight,
which was a Eddie Alvarez,

3775
02:57:54,020 --> 02:57:55,880
but the fight before that,
there was a rematch with nate.

3776
02:57:55,881 --> 02:57:56,714
Nate beat him in the first five and then
it was a real close fight in the second 

3777
02:57:59,301 --> 02:58:00,134
fight.
And Connor wanted decision and nate 

3778
02:58:01,381 --> 02:58:02,214
saying that he won't fight unless he 
gets 20 million bucks and a lot of 

3779
02:58:03,871 --> 02:58:05,580
people say,
well that's too much.

3780
02:58:05,730 --> 02:58:08,700
He's not going to get paid that I don't.
I don't know how much.

3781
02:58:09,150 --> 02:58:10,500
Like,
how much money is there?

3782
02:58:10,510 --> 02:58:11,343
Like let's look at it this way to be 20 
million in purse or in endorsements or 

3783
02:58:15,271 --> 02:58:17,200
it's going to be perse,
but here's.

3784
02:58:17,220 --> 02:58:19,210
And paper you is separate than purse,
right?

3785
02:58:20,070 --> 02:58:20,441
Well,
no,

3786
02:58:20,441 --> 02:58:22,590
no,
no paper views based on pers.

3787
02:58:22,810 --> 02:58:23,643
Pers is based on paper,
like you get points or you get a piece 

3788
02:58:26,341 --> 02:58:28,260
of the action or you can get a 
guarantee,

3789
02:58:28,500 --> 02:58:29,790
right?
So if it's going to be guaranteed,

3790
02:58:29,791 --> 02:58:32,400
like say if that's what he said.
And obviously I'm not a mathematician,

3791
02:58:32,401 --> 02:58:33,234
we know this,
right?

3792
02:58:33,330 --> 02:58:36,630
So if he said 20 million bucks,
that's what he wants to fight for them.

3793
02:58:37,020 --> 02:58:38,700
If paper view is what,
$60,

3794
02:58:38,730 --> 02:58:40,740
how much does it cost?
Let's say it's 60 and they,

3795
02:58:40,741 --> 02:58:42,240
let's say they sell a million paper 
reviews,

3796
02:58:42,241 --> 02:58:44,480
which is an excellent number.
That's $60.

3797
02:58:44,481 --> 02:58:46,200
Million dollars,
right?

3798
02:58:46,300 --> 02:58:47,070
Yep.
Okay,

3799
02:58:47,070 --> 02:58:47,903
so $60,000,000.
He wants a third of that right off the 

3800
02:58:49,801 --> 02:58:52,650
top and then you would got to think,
well who's going to fight?

3801
02:58:52,651 --> 02:58:53,484
Conor?
Conor is going to take a third of that 

3802
02:58:54,151 --> 02:58:55,020
to write it.

3803
02:58:55,020 --> 02:58:57,150
At least he's going to,
he's not going to take less than me.

3804
02:58:57,780 --> 02:59:00,390
What's up nate?
And he's gonna fight conor.

3805
02:59:00,810 --> 02:59:01,643
So if he's gonna fight connor,
Connor's going to take probably even 

3806
02:59:03,241 --> 02:59:04,500
more than that.
Right?

3807
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:06,840
So it's 20 and what?
Twenty five.

3808
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:10,890
So there's less for the UFC then those 
two guys.

3809
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:11,873
Well that's how it is in boxing,
that's how it is in like if you look at 

3810
02:59:14,850 --> 02:59:15,683
the person's for like a lot of boxing 
matches the way they have it described 

3811
02:59:18,601 --> 02:59:19,434
as like the big guys like floyd 
mayweather get the lion's share of the 

3812
02:59:21,181 --> 02:59:24,220
purse and then everybody else gets less 
including the promoter.

3813
02:59:24,221 --> 02:59:25,054
So ticket sales,
which is probably just a couple of 

3814
02:59:26,601 --> 02:59:27,434
million ticket sales are probably pretty
substantial or anywhere it is to get 

3815
02:59:30,630 --> 02:59:32,610
five.
It was 17 point 7 million.

3816
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:33,473
So there you go.
Seventeen point 7 million in Madison 

3817
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:36,023
Square Garden.
Right.

3818
02:59:36,090 --> 02:59:41,090
And then what about that giant Vegas 
place that the t mobile arena in Vegas,

3819
02:59:41,491 --> 02:59:42,690
that's a lot more people.

3820
02:59:42,690 --> 02:59:43,900
When that sells out,
what is it?

3821
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:47,070
You're saying $70 million for one ticket
sales.

3822
02:59:47,080 --> 02:59:49,110
That's the square garden.
Holy Shit.

3823
02:59:49,111 --> 02:59:51,960
Yeah.
So then you've got merchandise,

3824
02:59:52,230 --> 02:59:53,460
but that's theirs,
right?

3825
02:59:53,470 --> 02:59:54,303
Because it's about the UFC.
It's not about the fighter like I don't 

3826
02:59:56,311 --> 02:59:58,470
think.
I mean maybe if the fighter is selling,

3827
02:59:58,620 --> 03:00:00,180
they're selling conor mcgregor 
merchandise.

3828
03:00:00,181 --> 03:00:01,500
That's a different story.
Yeah.

3829
03:00:01,501 --> 03:00:03,750
Then they should definitely get a giant 
chunk of that.

3830
03:00:03,751 --> 03:00:04,584
I don't know how much they get.
And then this isn't including 

3831
03:00:05,671 --> 03:00:07,140
sponsorships.
Well,

3832
03:00:07,141 --> 03:00:08,580
there's no sponsors,
right?

3833
03:00:08,610 --> 03:00:11,100
The UFC has some sponsors in the 
octagon.

3834
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:13,140
I mean they have some movie sponsors and
stuff,

3835
03:00:13,141 --> 03:00:13,974
but as for the fighters,
there's really no sponsors that they 

3836
03:00:15,691 --> 03:00:17,910
carry into the octagon with them.
The only sponsors,

3837
03:00:17,911 --> 03:00:20,670
Reebok and some people have a deal with 
monster energy drink.

3838
03:00:20,970 --> 03:00:23,280
Again,
putting hats on after they went.

3839
03:00:24,240 --> 03:00:25,073
Not always in the UFC,
most likely in beltour or unless they 

3840
03:00:26,971 --> 03:00:28,350
have a monster energy drink deal.

3841
03:00:28,620 --> 03:00:31,190
So UFC also has a deal with but it's,
it's,

3842
03:00:31,320 --> 03:00:32,520
it's real.
It's real weird.

3843
03:00:32,521 --> 03:00:34,650
For the longest time they did,
they had it all over their shorts.

3844
03:00:34,651 --> 03:00:35,484
They would wear whatever they want.
They would wear tee shirts coming into 

3845
03:00:37,351 --> 03:00:38,184
the octagon based on.
But then they signed this deal with 

3846
03:00:40,321 --> 03:00:42,240
Reebok and a lot of people are upset 
about it.

3847
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:44,730
They have to wear reebok stuff now.
Okay.

3848
03:00:45,240 --> 03:00:47,400
It's a hot point.
I'm sure.

3849
03:00:47,660 --> 03:00:48,690
A lot of money.
Yeah,

3850
03:00:48,750 --> 03:00:49,583
it is for a lot of fighters,
for a lot of fighters it's like it was 

3851
03:00:51,360 --> 03:00:53,940
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
So um,

3852
03:00:54,480 --> 03:00:56,520
so in terms of like how much money is 
left then,

3853
03:00:56,700 --> 03:00:59,620
how much does it cost to run a global 
organization like that?

3854
03:00:59,621 --> 03:01:02,560
How much does it cost to keep the 
infrastructure alive?

3855
03:01:02,561 --> 03:01:05,140
How much does it cost to upload 
everything to review,

3856
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:07,450
how much does it cost to hire all these 
people?

3857
03:01:07,570 --> 03:01:09,910
How much does it cost to put that 
production together?

3858
03:01:10,790 --> 03:01:11,623
Right.
So if it's only 60 million bucks and 

3859
03:01:13,151 --> 03:01:16,450
then 15 million bucks from obviously,
I don't know.

3860
03:01:16,451 --> 03:01:19,720
And there's got to be international shit
too because they sell it internationally

3861
03:01:19,721 --> 03:01:21,850
all over the world.
I mean the UFC is everywhere.

3862
03:01:21,970 --> 03:01:22,803
So a big fight,
Nate Diaz and conor mcgregor doesn't 

3863
03:01:25,031 --> 03:01:27,220
just sell in the United States.
It sells everywhere.

3864
03:01:27,221 --> 03:01:28,054
I don't know if that's all included.
I don't know how they work that shit 

3865
03:01:29,501 --> 03:01:30,334
out.
But my point is when someone says he 

3866
03:01:32,231 --> 03:01:33,064
wants $20,000,000,
that might make sense or that may may 

3867
03:01:36,400 --> 03:01:38,770
not make sense.
Like I don't know what the numbers are.

3868
03:01:39,010 --> 03:01:41,890
And also you gotta pay taxes,
like if you're making all that money,

3869
03:01:41,920 --> 03:01:43,930
if you're bringing it all that money,
you got to pay taxes on that money.

3870
03:01:43,931 --> 03:01:44,764
Who pays the taxes?
Does UFC pay the taxes first and then 

3871
03:01:46,721 --> 03:01:48,070
pay the fighters out of what's left?

3872
03:01:48,490 --> 03:01:51,430
Do they all act as private contractors?
That's a good question.

3873
03:01:51,460 --> 03:01:52,293
But I don't know.
But as far as like how much money 

3874
03:01:54,581 --> 03:01:56,770
they're making,
I think for a guy like conor mcgregor,

3875
03:01:56,771 --> 03:01:58,920
the correct answer would be a fuckload 
yeah.

3876
03:01:59,110 --> 03:02:01,810
He's making fuckloads of what's at five 
fights a year.

3877
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:04,740
He's not fighting that often,
but he's.

3878
03:02:04,820 --> 03:02:09,520
He's probably fought in the last 24 
months.

3879
03:02:09,790 --> 03:02:10,480
How many?
How many?

3880
03:02:10,480 --> 03:02:15,220
How many times have you fallen the last 
24 months he went on a crazy run beat.

3881
03:02:15,290 --> 03:02:19,330
Although he be dentists,
seaver all though.

3882
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:24,040
And then the nate diaz fight.
Eddie Alvarez

3883
03:02:26,220 --> 03:02:27,870
Twenty 15.
So one,

3884
03:02:27,871 --> 03:02:29,510
two,
three times in Twenty 15,

3885
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:31,560
three times in 2016.
So that's about right.

3886
03:02:31,561 --> 03:02:33,450
That's a lot of $5.
Million a year.

3887
03:02:33,480 --> 03:02:35,820
Every four months.
Like that is very hard on your body.

3888
03:02:36,570 --> 03:02:38,580
Very hard on your body.
Hard to do.

3889
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:41,610
But some guys like cowboy,
cowboy cerrone,

3890
03:02:41,611 --> 03:02:42,900
he lives off that.
That's what he love.

3891
03:02:42,950 --> 03:02:44,840
Think about it.
If you break down the numbers though,

3892
03:02:44,841 --> 03:02:49,280
and granted nfl or NBA has a lot more 
revenue coming in,

3893
03:02:49,281 --> 03:02:51,830
but you're also paying and you know,
nfl,

3894
03:02:52,250 --> 03:02:56,570
you got what 44 guys on the team is 
interested in these traders,

3895
03:02:56,571 --> 03:02:58,230
all that fucking shit.
You should look like

3896
03:02:58,250 --> 03:03:00,530
the number was put up,
the number of revenue,

3897
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:04,040
the amount of revenue that they bring in
versus the UFC.

3898
03:03:04,041 --> 03:03:07,640
It's hilarious.
But the NFL is like $375 billion.

3899
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,040
The UFC is like to.
Yeah,

3900
03:03:10,100 --> 03:03:12,440
I mean the difference is fucking 
preposterous.

3901
03:03:12,441 --> 03:03:14,570
Yeah.
Like find out there's a chart,

3902
03:03:14,790 --> 03:03:19,790
like a graph that they can show you that
somebody put together that shows you the

3903
03:03:19,941 --> 03:03:21,980
NBA,
the nfl,

3904
03:03:22,040 --> 03:03:26,060
Major League baseball and MMA is like 
below hockey

3905
03:03:26,270 --> 03:03:31,010
and you know that porn use to beat all 
of them put together NBA,

3906
03:03:31,011 --> 03:03:32,510
nfl,
all of it.

3907
03:03:32,570 --> 03:03:34,880
And CBS,
NBC and ABC as well.

3908
03:03:34,910 --> 03:03:39,910
And all the major movies all together,
dwarfed by porn.

3909
03:03:40,490 --> 03:03:42,290
And now it's gone.
Now it's all gone.

3910
03:03:42,291 --> 03:03:46,040
I mean the Avn awards at its height,
I hosted it when it was 7,000

3911
03:03:46,041 --> 03:03:46,874
people in the audience on showtime.
Now it's like 200 losers in a room with 

3912
03:03:52,311 --> 03:03:54,680
an open mic or hosting it.
Yeah,

3913
03:03:55,190 --> 03:03:57,020
it's over.
Whoa.

3914
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:58,130
I shouldn't say

3915
03:03:58,130 --> 03:03:59,240
that.
I don't want to disparage them.

3916
03:03:59,241 --> 03:04:01,130
Let's just say it's smaller than it used
to be.

3917
03:04:01,280 --> 03:04:03,830
I just think they're doing awesome.
Craft work now.

3918
03:04:03,890 --> 03:04:04,723
Now it's.
They're doing it for the love of the 

3919
03:04:05,361 --> 03:04:06,350
art,
I think.

3920
03:04:06,450 --> 03:04:08,660
Sounds different.
I mean I.

3921
03:04:08,720 --> 03:04:11,000
for me it's all about Japanese hidden 
camera.

3922
03:04:11,001 --> 03:04:12,620
Massage porn.
That's your shit.

3923
03:04:13,010 --> 03:04:14,330
Yeah,
because it's real.

3924
03:04:14,331 --> 03:04:17,540
I got to see shit.
That's real casting couch guarantee that

3925
03:04:17,541 --> 03:04:20,820
a lot of that is real.
That's what I liked.

3926
03:04:21,400 --> 03:04:22,233
Nerves.
Want to see the girl a little bit 

3927
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:25,920
nervous.
Confused.

3928
03:04:26,430 --> 03:04:27,263
I want to see the transition in her eyes
from I'm auditioning for a Pajama 

3929
03:04:30,031 --> 03:04:31,890
commercial to.
I'm taking it

3930
03:04:32,470 --> 03:04:35,550
hit hard on camera.
Yeah.

3931
03:04:36,070 --> 03:04:38,420
I don't want to see two people that are,
you know,

3932
03:04:38,680 --> 03:04:41,020
too into it.
I want to see.

3933
03:04:41,021 --> 03:04:43,090
I want to see somebody get taken for a 
ride.

3934
03:04:43,420 --> 03:04:45,910
Somebody just get hoodwinked.
Yeah.

3935
03:04:45,940 --> 03:04:47,080
Like the massage thing,

3936
03:04:47,950 --> 03:04:51,190
they're getting a regular massage from a
woman and it's a good massage.

3937
03:04:51,191 --> 03:04:53,710
You can tell that these are like 
practice misuses,

3938
03:04:54,130 --> 03:04:55,790
and then all of a sudden they just get 
their there,

3939
03:04:55,840 --> 03:04:56,673
their on their stomach and they,
they get up in that ass crack a little 

3940
03:04:58,931 --> 03:04:59,764
bit and they get down in the valley and 
you can see and they've got a camera on 

3941
03:05:02,501 --> 03:05:03,334
the woman's face and above and below and
usually somewhere else and they keep it 

3942
03:05:07,241 --> 03:05:08,074
on the face.
You can see the eyes open and kind of 

3943
03:05:10,211 --> 03:05:14,320
look around and I'm telling you,
fucking Mia Farrow,

3944
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:15,993
who's a great actress.
A Jane Fonda couldn't portray the Sufi 

3945
03:05:20,411 --> 03:05:21,244
dunaway.
Faye dunaway could not portray the 

3946
03:05:23,531 --> 03:05:28,531
subtle nuances of coming around to being
suddenly fingered by.

3947
03:05:29,291 --> 03:05:30,060
I'm assuming.

3948
03:05:30,060 --> 03:05:32,040
Oh,
so you think it's real.

3949
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:35,220
I defy anybody.
I will.

3950
03:05:35,370 --> 03:05:38,850
I will send you clips that are 
undeniable.

3951
03:05:39,180 --> 03:05:41,880
I think you should take that and run 
with it.

3952
03:05:42,180 --> 03:05:44,970
Just don't look at anything that points 
to the contrary.

3953
03:05:44,980 --> 03:05:46,320
Right?
Why would I?

3954
03:05:46,350 --> 03:05:48,960
Why would you?
What his line of perception.

3955
03:05:49,500 --> 03:05:52,440
It's not reality.
It's not empowering to think that that's

3956
03:05:52,441 --> 03:05:53,274
staged and you're just being tricked by 
some unenthusiastic people didn't need 

3957
03:05:56,461 --> 03:05:57,300
the money.
No.

3958
03:05:57,301 --> 03:05:59,040
You want to think that this is a real 
massage.

3959
03:05:59,041 --> 03:06:01,280
Absolutely.
Realize finger in her completely.

3960
03:06:02,540 --> 03:06:04,350
Heck no,
I don't watch those.

3961
03:06:04,380 --> 03:06:06,920
You don't want something because that 
seems rapey rapey.

3962
03:06:07,380 --> 03:06:09,750
But what if the guy's laying down the 
grill just starts sucking his dick.

3963
03:06:09,770 --> 03:06:13,500
Now that's from a girl and guy gets a 
massage from a girl.

3964
03:06:13,501 --> 03:06:15,060
She just starts blowing them.
Well,

3965
03:06:15,061 --> 03:06:15,894
she,
you know,

3966
03:06:16,260 --> 03:06:18,030
a woman is pleasuring.
Another woman.

3967
03:06:18,090 --> 03:06:19,200
Okay,
I see what you're saying.

3968
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:20,370
You like it?
Yeah,

3969
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:21,180
because it's.
Yeah,

3970
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:23,460
I enjoy it.
You want to see everyone had a good day.

3971
03:06:23,550 --> 03:06:25,740
Everybody had a good day.
You know the [inaudible] is getting paid

3972
03:06:25,741 --> 03:06:27,450
handsomely.
She knows she's on camera.

3973
03:06:27,720 --> 03:06:30,690
Plus they're lesbians.
I think most women are.

3974
03:06:30,691 --> 03:06:32,520
They don't get a chance to explore it as
much.

3975
03:06:32,610 --> 03:06:34,800
Wow.
Strong words for some hidden cameras and

3976
03:06:34,801 --> 03:06:37,050
they're receiving what really happened.
I can't believe he's saying that.

3977
03:06:38,340 --> 03:06:42,820
I believe that all women have the 
propensity for lesbians,

3978
03:06:42,821 --> 03:06:45,990
lesbianism because it's soft.
They're being touched in a gentle way.

3979
03:06:48,090 --> 03:06:52,320
Not The way I do it.
I do my lesbian and stuff.

3980
03:06:52,830 --> 03:06:54,480
Lesbian biker style.
Yeah.

3981
03:06:54,750 --> 03:06:56,160
That's style.
A lot of hardware.

3982
03:06:56,430 --> 03:06:58,030
What kind of.
What style of fucking do you employ?

3983
03:06:58,050 --> 03:07:00,930
Something like a lesbian biker.
My shirt.

3984
03:07:01,800 --> 03:07:02,633
I'm like,
how a lesbian would fuck you if she was 

3985
03:07:03,811 --> 03:07:05,370
mad with a strap on.
Yeah,

3986
03:07:05,400 --> 03:07:09,540
she's mad.
Angry boots on.

3987
03:07:09,660 --> 03:07:13,340
You were flirting with a guy.
The pizza thought so just fucking.

3988
03:07:13,350 --> 03:07:15,650
Oh,
you were talking to the enemy?

3989
03:07:15,990 --> 03:07:16,823
Yeah.
She's got like a strap on with like 

3990
03:07:18,351 --> 03:07:19,184
little,
like a dog collar with those little 

3991
03:07:20,371 --> 03:07:23,970
buttons.
Little silver snaps pops in place.

3992
03:07:24,110 --> 03:07:25,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

3993
03:07:25,500 --> 03:07:28,290
Big Green Dick.
That's what I think.

3994
03:07:28,320 --> 03:07:31,230
Yeah.
She probably heats it up in the water.

3995
03:07:31,231 --> 03:07:33,180
Just like that chicken cutlet trick I 
told you earlier.

3996
03:07:33,181 --> 03:07:34,510
I can't wait to get home.
Hi.

3997
03:07:34,640 --> 03:07:38,450
Do we have for dinner tonight?
Greg Fitzsimmons and space and pool.

3998
03:07:39,230 --> 03:07:41,930
Tell these people where to were to get 
your tickets.

3999
03:07:41,931 --> 03:07:44,480

months.

4002
03:07:49,641 --> 03:07:52,790
I've doubled my downloads.
That's what the fuck happened.

4003
03:07:52,791 --> 03:07:57,080
Podcasting is super popular.
Big Man do to come back.

4004
03:07:58,050 --> 03:08:00,620
You came out with New Year's Day.

03:08:05,230 --> 03:08:06,470
Yeah.
Your podcast is awesome.

4009
03:08:06,730 --> 03:08:08,750
It's still on.
I'm serious as well.

4010
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:11,480
I'm doing the show on Sirius Monday

4012
03:08:14,060 --> 03:08:16,940
Have those shows ever available online?
Yes.

4013
03:08:16,980 --> 03:08:18,780
They're on the APP there on the serious 
side of sap.

4014
03:08:18,860 --> 03:08:19,693
And then also they're letting me release
the old serious episodes now on the

Yeah.
Congratulations.

4022
03:08:34,281 --> 03:08:36,440
Serious company.
That's a great company,

4023
03:08:36,441 --> 03:08:37,550
man.
That's how it should be done.

4024
03:08:37,550 --> 03:08:40,010
That's a very cool thing that they did.
I've been there for eight years.

4025
03:08:40,011 --> 03:08:40,844
I've never gotten one note about.
Do this right in the fucking note right

Stuck talking about chicken cutlets.

That's San Francisco.

4030
03:08:56,360 --> 03:08:56,991
Fuck,

4031
03:08:56,991 --> 03:08:59,300

That's one of the great clubs.

03:08:59,301 --> 03:09:00,320
Yeah.
That's one of the best.
