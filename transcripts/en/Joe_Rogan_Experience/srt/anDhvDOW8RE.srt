1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,970
Joe rogan podcast by night all
day Weidman was pressing him,

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:09,060
but Anderson was kicking him a
lot in the legs and I was looking.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,420
I was like,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:09,930
Ooh,

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,610
like he's kicking his legs a lot.

6
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,450
He did a lot of times,

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,560
like crazy taunting,

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,170
but you know what?

9
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,450
Weidman did something really slick.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,820
He did something really slick.

11
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:21,810
It's really interesting.

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,000
He threw a back fist,

13
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,420
he threw a punch and then he threw a
back fist because they understand what's

14
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:27,900
going on.

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,680
He was bobbing and weaving
and bobbing and weaving,

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,733
moving away from.

17
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,090
So he figures if the rights
coming in the left's comment,

18
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,890
so he throws a punch.

19
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:36,320
Mrs then throws it back fist,

20
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,280
which makes Anderson have to go that way.

21
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:38,851
Right?

22
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:42,720
So then when he starts going that way
the other way and catches him with a left

23
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,260
hook,

24
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:43,760
it's a.

25
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,480
it's a beautiful combination.

26
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,030
It's a beautiful combination with a guy,

27
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,360
moves his head a lot because you forced
them because you're not just throwing

28
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,320
one in that direction.

29
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,490
You throw in a second one,

30
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,140
so he's going that way,

31
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,540
which is like when you throw a left hook,

32
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,620
he's going that way,

33
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,230
so he's already going the
way to avoid the left hook.

34
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,540
He's got to come back and when
it comes to when it comes back,

35
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,403
boom.

36
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,110
He catches him.

37
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,421
Perfect.

38
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:05,780
He was like,

39
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,613
it's brilliant.

40
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,071
Beautiful Time.

41
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:12,690
It's the setup before the fucking
blow to it looked a little slower than

42
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,111
Anderson,

43
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,170
so he was having a hard time catching
them and they understand was staying on

44
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,610
the outside and kicking his legs a lot.

45
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,090
But they had collided in the first round
and he took anderson down and wrapped

46
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,940
one of his legs up and
had them pretty tight.

47
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,210
It's like you might be getting a leg lock
or attempting to leg lock and Anderson

48
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,020
got out of it.

49
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,610
Isn't that the fight to where at the,

50
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,930
after the fight where Weidman was like,

51
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,370
make your decision now you're
either on board or you're not.

52
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,031
I think there was no,

53
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:36,910
that was another fight.

54
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,981
Another fight.

55
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:38,640
Yeah.

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,750
I think that was,

57
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:40,584
um,

58
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,850
that was after vituro sick
after he beat up beat tour.

59
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,301
He's like,

60
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,960
pick your title.

61
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,261
Yeah.

62
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:46,651
I was like,

63
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:46,861
well,

64
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:47,694
I'm bored.

65
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,421
I was like,

66
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:49,254
Damn Chris,

67
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,000
you've had up to now to decide.

68
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,343
Pretty good.

69
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,770
Yeah.

70
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,460
You know,

71
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,540
he's an interesting guy.

72
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,700
He takes a loss like a fucking champ.

73
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,563
I'll tell you that.

74
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,090
He lost till Yoel Romero by knockout
and then the was sitting on the das

75
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,770
entering questions later with
this aisle all stitched up.

76
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:05,971
You know what I mean?

77
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,804
He's a,

78
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,570
he's a,

79
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,300
uh,

80
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,080
he's a stud.

81
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,311
You know,

82
00:02:10,311 --> 00:02:11,520
if I was hard to do man.

83
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:11,671
Oh,

84
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,280
I bet.

85
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,660
Kao.

86
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,291
And then just answer,

87
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:17,040
answer questions with stitches over your
eye and you're talking to press people.

88
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,950
I've seen some guys real fucked
up at perfect composure though.

89
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:21,040
You handled it perfectly.

90
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,100
That was at that Gustafson,

91
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,950
Jon Jones fight where they,

92
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,600
I think they both went to the hospital.

93
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,040
It was brutal.

94
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:29,791
Brutal,

95
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,790
brutal fight where it was a decision.

96
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:33,031
Fine,

97
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:33,450
I think.

98
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,010
Yeah.

99
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,240
Yeah.

100
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,520
Then it was like the,

101
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,890
like they just massacred each other,

102
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,220
you know,

103
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,020
they're just beat the
shit out of each other.

104
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
That was a crazy fight.

105
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,380
Yeah.

106
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,600
That was a fight where John was talking
about it when he was on the podcast was

107
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:49,080
talking about how much he partied
after that fight for the fight.

108
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,663
Partying a lot.

109
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,350
Wow.

110
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,710
Yeah.

111
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,730
It was incredible fight.

112
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,900
I just remember her bloodied.

113
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,734
Those guys were.

114
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,221
Yeah.

115
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,054
It was a rough fight.

116
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,680
Gustafson shocked.

117
00:02:58,681 --> 00:02:59,350
A lot of people.

118
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,680
Yeah.

119
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,580
That's the crowd.

120
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,500
You could feel the crowd swell.

121
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,170
What I always call mma,

122
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,270
this is the phrase I use all the time,

123
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:07,960
so maybe it'll start getting annoying too.

124
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:13,210
It's like extreme problem solving
with dire physical consequences.

125
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,970
That's why it's plus shit talking.

126
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,993
Right?

127
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,600
Throwing that to high stakes talking shit.

128
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:19,931
Yeah.

129
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,764
High stakes.

130
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,920
There's an emotions battle whether
or not you can keep your emotions.

131
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,000
How will you handle pressure?

132
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,873
That's giant.

133
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,410
That's the thing about conor
mcgregor more than anything.

134
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,630
Like,

135
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:30,970
Nah,

136
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,140
we shouldn't say more than anything.

137
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,670
It's one of many things about them.

138
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,540
That's pretty interesting.

139
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,710
One of the most interesting things about
him as he handles pressure like nobody

140
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,440
I've ever seen.

141
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,090
Yeah.

142
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,710
Like when he fought Aldo for the title,

143
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,360
he didn't even look remotely nervous.

144
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:44,470
He was super relaxed,

145
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,304
super calm,

146
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,860
but then you start to
think though that you go,

147
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,950
how much of what you're seeing is how
pressure is manifested through that guy.

148
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,301
You know what I mean?

149
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,410
Like for instance,

150
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,990
the press conference kind of antics.

151
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,470
You're like,

152
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,303
is that,

153
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,050
is that genuine?

154
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,520
Is that an act?

155
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,550
Is that how he handles the pressure of
this high pressure situation by doing a

156
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,420
fucking,

157
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:09,880
you know,

158
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,151
Bang,

159
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,190
Bang show at the time.

160
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,393
So like it.

161
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,840
But I personally,

162
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,920
I find the guy,

163
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,221
which is,

164
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,971
I think what you want,

165
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:17,350
why someone becomes a star,

166
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,770
a endlessly entertaining
on top of being good.

167
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,251
So I,

168
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:21,730
you know,

169
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,630
I'm tuning into,

170
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,800
I want to see the fucking show.

171
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,990
He's the best shit talker of all time.

172
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,470
I don't know.

173
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,710
I've said that before about other people
before that I said Chael Sonnen was the

174
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:32,770
best shit talker of all time
and I think he was for awhile,

175
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,430
but I think Connor Thompson
and also all also as well.

176
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:42,320
Connor has an additional significance
to a shit-talking because he knocked

177
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:43,100
people dead.

178
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,730
Right?

179
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,870
It's a totally different thing.

180
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:45,090
And,

181
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,360
and not that he's not a fucking animal
because Chael Sonnen is an animal and

182
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:48,880
he's,

183
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,650
he's submitted Shogun who a shell ends,

184
00:04:51,651 --> 00:04:52,910
a very solid grappler,

185
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:55,550
sure came very close to beating
Anderson Silva in their first fight.

186
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,600
So He's a stud.

187
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,920
But what connor does differently
is the isis guys with one punch,

188
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,110
and that's a big factor in fight when
you're watching him and he fights Eddie

189
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,820
Alvarez and all of a sudden he things
and with the lefthand and catches them a

190
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:10,070
rock some early on you go,

191
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,750
Holy Shit.

192
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,260
And he realized he's fighting
the guy now at 155 pounds.

193
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,820
And Eddie Alvarez a big one,

194
00:05:16,821 --> 00:05:17,390
55.

195
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,200
He's a big guy,

196
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,250
big muscular guy.

197
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,380
The idea is that he's gonna
be able to wrestle connor.

198
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,530
He's going to be able to grab them and
grind them out the same way you did with

199
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,364
Anthony Pettis.

200
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,713
Nope.

201
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,470
Nope.

202
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,210
Dealing with a totally different animal.

203
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,530
Connor's just got a totally different
kind of focus as far as like the way zooms

204
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:36,320
in on targets and his precision.

205
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,340
It's just speed.

206
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:40,280
He's just dropping it in there
with a 100 percent speed,

207
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,140
like that's a big part of what he's doing.

208
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,830
He's not loading up at all and the
ability to stay calm when you load up,

209
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,490
say like if you see someone coming
at you and you just go like,

210
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,530
all that's wasted time that's wasted
time with connor has is the ability to be

211
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,900
perfectly technical in a firefight.

212
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,360
So like Aldos.

213
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,720
Yeah,

214
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,630
charging Adam.

215
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,790
This is like 13 seconds into the fight.

216
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,910
All those charts and Adam and he knows
how to just slide back and blam drops

217
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,930
that lefthanded in on it is a striking.

218
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:10,340
The strongest part of his.

219
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,821
Yes,

220
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,481
for sure.

221
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,770
His ground game is underrated.

222
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,060
He's very good on the ground.

223
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,751
This was very good.

224
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:15,584
Defensively.

225
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,940
He's got a good sweep sweep.

226
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:17,481
Nate Diaz.

227
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,010
Their first people forget that.

228
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,790
He's the kind of guy.

229
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,730
How much would you love to watch
before he was a professional?

230
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,570
I did watch them.

231
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:23,710
Well,

232
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,810
not before the bar fights though.

233
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,321
Oh Geez.

234
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:26,661
You know,

235
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,340
he's been in some definite scrap bars,

236
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:32,390
but I don't think you're allowed
to like get 18 in Ireland.

237
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,740
If you haven't been in a bar fight.

238
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,574
Yeah man,

239
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,970
we're going out tonight
lead when you're chatty.

240
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,950
That's probably the worst accent ever.

241
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,090
Probably right up there.

242
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,960
But um,

243
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,400
I saw them fight in a

244
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,123
cage warriors.

245
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,220
I tweeted to him in like 2013
before he came to the UFC.

246
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:51,850
I said,

247
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm a big fan man.

248
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,210
Want you to come over and diddy?

249
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:55,901
Yeah.

250
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:56,361
I mean like,

251
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,380
right after that.

252
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,130
Um,

253
00:06:58,130 --> 00:06:58,701
the uh,

254
00:06:58,701 --> 00:06:59,750
you have seen him.

255
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,160
Totally coincidentally.

256
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:01,670
I didn't cry.

257
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,031
I mean,

258
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,510
I definitely probably told
anybody listen to me about,

259
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,050
because I'd seen him fight before.

260
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:06,261
I'm like,

261
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:06,561
this kid.

262
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:07,460
Isis people.

263
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,060
Yeah.

264
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,810
His lefthand,

265
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,860
it's just devastating.

266
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,630
And he's got a crazy style.

267
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:12,730
He fights.

268
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,910
It was like wide stance and he
moves different and he cracks guys.

269
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,121
I'm like,

270
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:17,841
this kid's legit.

271
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:18,980
I'd like to see him in the UFC.

272
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,910
I never asked you there.

273
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,503
Yeah,

274
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,820
that's January of 2013.

275
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,200
So it was almost four years ago.

276
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,820
Did you,

277
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,450
did you think,

278
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:29,890
uh,

279
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,420
I never talked to you about
what did you think of all the,

280
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:32,960
um,

281
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,201
you know,

282
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:36,020
the talks of a him floyd mayweather fight.

283
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,220
You fight them.

284
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,530
I guarantee you he would
fight if you think,

285
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:42,320
what kind of match do you think
that he's a lot bigger than floyd?

286
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,040
First of all,

287
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,261
let's,

288
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:46,820
let's just emphasize
that he's a lot bigger,

289
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,220
so it'd be a real problem as far as like
weight cutting because if they went,

290
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,300
layla conor fight it wherever he wants.

291
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:56,080
Connor's is going away
somewhere around 170 pounds.

292
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,330
Right.

293
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,710
That's where he's at his best.

294
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,900
Like in his optimum
with no weight cutting.

295
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,650
Yeah.

296
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,670
I don't think Floyd's that big.

297
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,043
I think floyd,

298
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,680
I guarantee you he's probably
not more than one 60.

299
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,640
Do you think Floyd's bigger than 1:16.

300
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,493
Real life.

301
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,830
Small Dude.

302
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,663
He's a small guy.

303
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,250
He's really nice.

304
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,320
Short doesn't mean wait,

305
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,154
but he's small.

306
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,960
What weight did he begin his career at?

307
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,833
Floyd Mayweather.

308
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,060
I mean,

309
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,480
I'm a huge floyd mayweather fan and
I think that when it comes to boxing,

310
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,090
I think he's one of the most
skillful boxers that's ever lived.

311
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,770
I really do technical,

312
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,770
if not the most 1:50.

313
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,731
But uh,

314
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:33,320
that's probably what he lasts.

315
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:36,200
Fought at like didn't
he make 'em when he met,

316
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,170
when he fought Canelo didn't you make
him come down a bit and made them come

317
00:08:39,171 --> 00:08:40,970
down to like 1:54 or something like that?

318
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,893
It sounds right.

319
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,100
Something like that.

320
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,640
I thought they had some sort
of a catch weight fight.

321
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,533
I remember.

322
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,910
And Canelo's fight.

323
00:08:49,911 --> 00:08:51,500
Nobody's fighting at one 60 now.

324
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,690
He's definitely bigger.

325
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,010
Or was he fighting at 1:54?

326
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,340
Kinetica Lufkin is one 60,

327
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:56,640
right?

328
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,260
Is that the.

329
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,290
Hold up is the two of them because I
think I feel like Canelo has been fighting

330
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:01,801
middle way too.

331
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,670
Like he fought Kodo.

332
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,211
What was that?

333
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:04,044
That

334
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,560
wasn't that at middleweight or 1:54?

335
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,513
Alvarez.

336
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,910
Alvarez catch weight 1:50 1:52.

337
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,953
Okay.

338
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,471
Yeah.

339
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,240
So he made canelo loose some weight.

340
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:15,840
He just.

341
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,030
Canal is a lot bigger than him.

342
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,790
Yeah.

343
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,140
So canal probably walks around
maybe 20 pounds heavier than that.

344
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,340
That's a bad motherfucker too.

345
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,080
He's good.

346
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,840
Yeah.

347
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,120
And me that just boxed him up yet.

348
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,570
What I'm hearing plot all look at that.

349
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,150
Just beautiful technique that's wonder,

350
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:34,920
um,

351
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,221
could,

352
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:35,780
uh,

353
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,180
is,

354
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,850
is like connor's skills,

355
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,680
just technical skills match up to
somebody like the counter counter defense.

356
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,260
I can't imagine they would
unless they were there.

357
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,820
So out of shape.

358
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,330
Yeah.

359
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:48,670
Him,

360
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,160
I'm saying on top of his game,

361
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,620
him on top of his game,

362
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:53,760
you're not going to hit him.

363
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,880
He's going to know.

364
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,950
I mean you have to be really
top level to catch him.

365
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,400
It's so nuts at that
dude is so fast that he,

366
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,150
he box it like nobody's,

367
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:05,610
uh,

368
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,380
with his lead hand down.

369
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,480
Not even hip level.

370
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,430
Mid Thigh sometimes.

371
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,850
Well it's because that
forces his shoulder over.

372
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,730
It's actually an easier way
to block a lot of things.

373
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:18,720
If you're skillful with it.

374
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,723
You got shoulder.

375
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,920
Heck yeah.

376
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,560
You got to be.

377
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
It's not just quick.

378
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:23,550
And he's definitely quick.

379
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,420
It's very quick.

380
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:26,670
But what floyd has over,

381
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,620
like almost anyone else,

382
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,280
he said he's got this incredible knowledge
of what you're going to do before you

383
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:32,940
do it.

384
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,160
Like he knows so much about boxing,

385
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,460
about boxing as a science from
his brother or his father rather.

386
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,294
And his uncle,

387
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,530
his uncle's Roger May,

388
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:45,300
whether it was a black Mamba who an
all time fucking exciting guy to watch.

389
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,590
And like the eighties and nineties,

390
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:47,910
he would starched people,

391
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:48,240
man,

392
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
dude him on those hbo shows.

393
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,120
They've never had a better
comedy than Roger May.

394
00:10:53,121 --> 00:10:53,954
Whether moments.

395
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,090
It's the greatest.

396
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,271
Oh,

397
00:10:55,271 --> 00:10:56,560
you mean in between corners?

398
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,100
No,

399
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,650
when they used to do the 24 slash seven,

400
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,060
24 slash seven,

401
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,440
he would fucking massacre lowe's.

402
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,600
The funniest shit I've ever seen.

403
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,690
And they edited him.

404
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,480
So fucking funny.

405
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:11,920
One of those fights there were fighting,

406
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,600
maybe it was Alvarez or somebody.

407
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,890
And I was like,

408
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,410
we got to prepare for
Florida and watch his fights.

409
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,663
And uh,

410
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,320
and I'm just,

411
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,420
I know I'm just going to have
the fight in my life on my hands.

412
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,330
And then they cut to Roy or to,

413
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,410
to Roger Mayweather.

414
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,110
He goes,

415
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,520
who the fuck is Albert is

416
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:29,943
like,

417
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,470
he was pretending he doesn't
even know who the guy

418
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,310
was.

419
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,530
You know that that was a big
part of the preparation for.

420
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,790
I don't know if it in the end it was,

421
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,950
but for a long time
when they would go like,

422
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,390
how are you preparing for this fighter?

423
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,200
His,

424
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,760
his answer and they're legit answer was
like they have to prepare for this shit.

425
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,250
We're not preparing for anything.

426
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,910
He better prepare a lot you.

427
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,160
And that's how they would approach

428
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,251
it.

429
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:54,401
Like,

430
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,480
we're not studying you.

431
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,480
You need to study this shit right
now because it's going to be bad.

432
00:11:58,481 --> 00:11:59,314
What happens to you?

433
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,370
That was points.

434
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,030
Yeah,

435
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,863
it's a good point.

436
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,020
You know,

437
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,210
Floyd's an interesting guy.

438
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,030
He's had his hands
broken a bunch of times.

439
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,800
Yeah.

440
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:07,961
Is.

441
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,840
There's been rumors about like fights
that he must have had a broken hand in.

442
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,220
Oh,

443
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,570
he has had hands that were
broken and he's still boxed that.

444
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,590
What does that feel like?

445
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,990
As soon as just got a winner's mentality,

446
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,321
you know,

447
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:22,870
you can talk all the shit you want about
that guy because it's fun to talk shit

448
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,870
about him because you've created
this persona that started in May.

449
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,220
Whether it's brilliant,

450
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,210
it's a brilliant thing.

451
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,170
What he did is brilliant.

452
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,240
He created like someone to hate,

453
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,800
but he's so talented.

454
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,680
You can't beat them and you're.

455
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,080
And you're buying that pay per view,

456
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:36,270
which is exactly what you want.

457
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,570
You're hoping cutting added.

458
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:37,730
Oh,

459
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,010
police Canada,

460
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,110
they're hoping Canelo can
catch them at their home pack.

461
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,953
Yogurt category.

462
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,031
Everyone.

463
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:46,260
Yeah.

464
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,640
Yeah.

465
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,950
There's a guy that he craves the villain.

466
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,090
Keep going down the line.

467
00:12:49,091 --> 00:12:50,500
Every fucking guy he's fought.

468
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,470
Please catch them.

469
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,760
Maybe you know you,

470
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,270
you saw with my own Marquez,

471
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:56,320
he had a tough fight with PAC.

472
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,173
Yeah.

473
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,240
Yeah.

474
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
Shuts them down overnight
and then he'd be like,

475
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,030
I got 100 watches man.

476
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,320
And then that shuts them all down.

477
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,130
People like,

478
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,150
they really fucking.

479
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,560
I don't hate at all.

480
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:06,550
I think that it's a.

481
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,240
sometimes that persona can
just get kind of boring.

482
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:10,840
It's fun.

483
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,400
It's fun.

484
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,450
Smart is it?

485
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,210
I'm like,

486
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,043
alright man,

487
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,351
just.

488
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,370
I'm saying like Instagram,

489
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:15,970
he's like,

490
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:17,080
look it up on my bed

491
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,773
and he'll be like,

492
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,590
you don't have a good night.

493
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,423
I'm going to count it,

494
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,160
and then it's hilarious.

495
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,981
It's funny,

496
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:24,814
it's entertaining,

497
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,300
but it is like one note he used to hold
like bricks and money up to his ear

498
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,110
phone.

499
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,550
Pretend he's talking on the money.

500
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,800
Larry's cars.

501
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,461
Exactly.

502
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:34,310
Ridiculous cars.

503
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:35,144
They're all white too.

504
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,390
He's got like bugattis and shit.

505
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,320
Basically three,

506
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,040
Jesus Christ.

507
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,030
Oh my goodness.

508
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,090
What is that $100 million dollars that
he got from what was just purse from one

509
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:49,264
of his fights.

510
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,380
He was a promoter.

511
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,820
He made a $100.

512
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:58,570
Million dollars is where hip hippies
start going crazy about income inequality.

513
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,033
There's a sense.

514
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:01,510
Look at it as he goes.

515
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,140
This is just one of my many checks.

516
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,850
Got To love these backseat drivers.

517
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:08,620
So worried about hipaa
school where you're going,

518
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,473
yeah.

519
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,460
Got To love these backseat drivers,

520
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:15,730
so worried about another man's legacy
instead of trying to write their own.

521
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,730
Ultimately I will always
have the last laugh.

522
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,860
This is just one of many checks.

523
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,641
Oh cool.

524
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:26,641
100 million dollars that I still have
every dime of y'all still have to work.

525
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,030
However,

526
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,200
I'm happily retired.

527
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,430
At the end of the day,

528
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,091
it's them.

529
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:32,890
Benjamin Franklins at matter to me.

530
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,180
So the joke's on you.

531
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,860
I've made smart investments.

532
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,930
Sorry for those who thought
that I couldn't read,

533
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:38,764
write or count.

534
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,443
Here we go.

535
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,651
Y'All call them.

536
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:42,730
Watch as I call them.

537
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:43,630
Time pieces.

538
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,560
Y'All call them bullets.

539
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,550
I called them yachts.

540
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,730
Y'all call them houses.

541
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,501
I call them manch.

542
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:47,870
What?

543
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,703
What does that mean?

544
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,220
Y'All chartered jets and we own jets.

545
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,330
The money team.

546
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,163
There you go.

547
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,190
Yeah,

548
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,023
I got it.

549
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,863
I think he's rich.

550
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,490
I think he definitely has money,

551
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,510
so he's made a lot of fucking money,

552
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,500
that's for damn sure.

553
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,270
He's excellent at what he does for sure.

554
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,133
Across the board.

555
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,130
Yeah.

556
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,210
I mean there's no doubt about it,

557
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,253
but he's also.

558
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,610
It's funny,

559
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:14,150
he's 49 and 49 slash 11
and he's the only guy.

560
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,670
He said he hasn't broken
rocky Marciano's record yet.

561
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,893
He's tied it,

562
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,370
which is really interesting.

563
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,990
Like I wonder if that's on purpose.

564
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,880
I wonder if he doesn't want to break it.

565
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:23,211
Well,

566
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:27,170
I think as well people talking
shit about the pressure of a of a,

567
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:30,140
of it going away is
the thing that happens.

568
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:31,190
Like as the older you get,

569
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:31,420
like,

570
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:31,911
you know what I mean?

571
00:15:31,911 --> 00:15:32,300
This is,

572
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,570
this is a good boxing retirement
age for him and it's like,

573
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,680
do you want to do 50?

574
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,131
Yes.

575
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:38,720
Well it's got to be a meaningful 50.

576
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,640
You can't some scrub for 50.
