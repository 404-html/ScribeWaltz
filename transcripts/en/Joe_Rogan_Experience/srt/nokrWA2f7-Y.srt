1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,990
If they don't fuck up,
I don't trust him.

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,540
My father,
my father used to say,

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,490
if someone doesn't say the word fuck or 
if their name is an initial,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,570
don't trust them.
Yeah.

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,490
That's a creepy one.
Initials are creepy.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,350
Yeah,
but you never know.

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,420
It's like,
it's not a hard fast rule.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,070
No.
I give everyone a fair shake,

9
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:24,120
but I'm looking at if they fricken.
If there all the time.

10
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,980
It's fricking this for Mickey.
Mickey.

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,530
Yeah.
I had that one time.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,820
I've never heard that one.
If someone said make a motherfucker.

13
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,200
Yeah.
I wasn't happy about it.

14
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:34,470
Shut the front door is one like moms 
like to do around their kids.

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,603
Yes.
I come from a whopper south philly 

16
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,070
family,
so it's like a fucking Richard Pryor.

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,440
Seven fishes on Christmas Eve.
It was like A.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,140
Richard is like him on the sunset strip.
He knows.

19
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,370
Surprisingly.
It doesn't swear.

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,710
Teddy Atlas.
I know teddy.

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,920
I,
I,

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,770
I've seen you know,
animated it.

23
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,200
I don't have to tell you.
You get very animated.

24
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:00,760
But yeah,
he doesn't really like fricking this and

25
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,430
fricking that.
Yeah.

26
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,320
What the Frick?
He says what the Frick.

27
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,760
It's not.
Yeah.

28
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,640
You know,
also doesn't swear Henry rollins.

29
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,740
Rollins does not,
does not swear.

30
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,420
It makes note of it.
Note that I don't swear he,

31
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,623
I mean,
I feel like that happened in the second 

32
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,890
half of his life because black flag 
records,

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,990
not so much.
Yeah.

34
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,560
I think he's trying to,
uh,

35
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,530
get more people to listen to them,
like trying to be more mainstream,

36
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:31,080
but he's trying to eliminate the noise.
Sure.

37
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,220
In what he's doing.
Sure.

38
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,200
He's a brilliant mind.
He is.

39
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,220
Yeah.
Yeah.

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,480
Unlike me,
I mean,

41
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:41,481
you're really Rogan.
You've hit a little snag here.

42
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,650
Teddy,
Atlas Jordan Peterson,

43
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:45,750
Shapiro.
Henry rollins.

44
00:01:45,751 --> 00:01:46,860
Than this.
No,

45
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,270
dude,
I love your music.

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,290
Thank you.
Out of here.

47
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,863
Now you're saying you were saying you 
know about fuckups before the show 

48
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,790
saying I don't know anybody who's an 
artist who doesn't fuck things up.

49
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,680
Like if you're,
if you're really creative,

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,800
there's something about being like 
legitimately creative.

51
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,290
There has to be something wrong with 
what you're wired differently.

52
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,530
So what we perceive as what people see 
perceive as fucking up isn't to us.

53
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,830
Yeah.
So technically it's a fuck up,

54
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:18,510
but in reality to us it's just,
I'm just behavioral.

55
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,850
It's just how it works.
I just traits.

56
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,180
If you were working at an office in 
human resources,

57
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,940
you would use the.
There's no way I'd be gone in like three

58
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:27,774
hours,
but before that I probably put a bullet 

59
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,830
through man,
if I was in a cubicle,

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,030
just give up at that point.
Some people can do it though.

61
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,470
So people.
It's not a problem.

62
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,660
No,
I just wired that way.

63
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,880
But I knew from such an early age.
Now I'm not wired this way.

64
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,410
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

65
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:47,320
Me Too.
Yeah.

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,120
I was terrified of getting a job when I 
was a child.

67
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,830
Yeah,
it's fearful.

68
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,230
But now what you've done though,
man,

69
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,620
it's um,
I've told you how much of a fan I am,

70
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:03,621
but I'm a fan of how punk rock.
You've built all of this outside of the,

71
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,760
what you were expected to do.
This show is a fuck you really.

72
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,790
It's just what it is.
You know what I mean?

73
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:15,624
This is the,
this is what happens when you don't 

74
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:17,940
calculate.
Yeah.

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,893
Well,
there's no cow.

76
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,030
Just do what you want to do.
This is what happened.

77
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:22,500
When people don't have the balls to do 
that.

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,050
It's a.
it's a little bit balls.

79
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,720
It's a little bit fear factor.
Gave me a lot of financial freedom.

80
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:28,554
Sure.
That was.

81
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,800
That helped too.
Sure.

82
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,000
When you radio news radio did a little 
bit,

83
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,010
but fear factor did way more.
Just gave you.

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,450
Gave me enough money so I go,
okay,

85
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,000
the money part I got.
Yeah.

86
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,440
So now let's just have some fun.
Sure.

87
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,170
But look what it's become.
Changed People's lives,

88
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:44,160
man.
It's weird.

89
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,260
That's the weird part that that wasn't 
the,

90
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,770
that wasn't anticipated.
It wasn't a part of the plan.

91
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,230
It was just supposed to be smoking weed 
and having a good time.

92
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,000
Well,
you're not aware until you're aware,

93
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,800
until people say,
Yo,

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,970
you've helped me through

95
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,470
tough times.
This show has got,

96
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,910
you know,
I people tell me about your show.

97
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,953
You're like,
that guy gets you through the tough 

98
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:04,760
times.
You know?

99
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,130
And that's what's more important than 
that.

100
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,320
Well,
people need friends,

101
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,220
they need community.
And one of the things that this show has

102
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:15,250
shown by having all my friends on all 
the times,

103
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,283
this is a tight group of people that 
love each other and care about each 

104
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:21,730
other and want to promote that way of 
thinking.

105
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,803
Being that you can do that you can get 
through life and all support each other 

106
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,074
like this back stabby bullshit that 
people get involved in that is so 

107
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:31,480
detrimental to you,
to them,

108
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:32,314
to everyone,
to the sense of community that you 

109
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,900
create around each other.
A clip of yours went viral.

110
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,500
You talking about just get the fuck.

111
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,320
Keep negative people the fuck away from 
me.

112
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,340
And I had that around me and it was 
draining my spirit.

113
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,320
You know,
one of the worst things,

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,820
but when you're living a certain way and
everything's fast,

115
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,840
same with comedy and you're on the road,
you're grinding it out,

116
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,460
you can always analyze.
You can always step back and say,

117
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:05,430
this is why things are fucked up because
everything's moving so fast.

118
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,340
You know?
And it wasn't until I took that time and

119
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,174
said,
there's cancers in my life that are 

120
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,613
there.
They're basically their emotional 

121
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:14,110
barnacles.
Yeah.

122
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,650
You know what I mean?
And once you,

123
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,653
once you cut the cancer out,
you see how different things become and 

124
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,320
it's a,
it's kind of,

125
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,210
um,
I didn't realize it was that easy.

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,630
Yeah,
you can do it,

127
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,240
you can do it,
but to them too,

128
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:36,060
it's a good lesson for them to be cast 
aside and for them,

129
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,320
if they're smart or if they have some 
awareness or some objectivity,

130
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,580
they're going to look at themselves and 
say,

131
00:05:41,581 --> 00:05:43,590
you know what,
I'm a fucking mess.

132
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,843
Like,
I'm negative all the time and people 

133
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,820
don't want to be around me.
I was real negative when I was young.

134
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:48,870
So as I,
yeah,

135
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,381
it's,
it's,

136
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:50,214
uh,
it's not something that's 

137
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,620
insurmountable.
You can get over.

138
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,511
Yeah.
And,

139
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,090
and it's whatever,
whatever,

140
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:58,483
whatever hand you've been dealt,
you have to realize the reality of 

141
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:01,610
situation,
Bro.

142
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,150
There's people living in mud huts in 
places that are smiling and the,

143
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,423
and I have the balls to be complaining 
about your writing and not getting 

144
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:14,400
enough sleep.
I don't like to travel.

145
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,650
You just really have to assess that and 
say,

146
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,733
this isn't the way I should be thinking 
or processing information because we're 

147
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:26,930
blessed to do what we do.
You know what I mean?

148
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:28,100
You make people laugh,
Bro.

149
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:29,300
For living.
I know

150
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,193
there's also,
there's a balance that you can achieve 

151
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,354
between discipline and the creative 
people like we were talking about like 

152
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:40,230
yourself who are just off hand tattoos,
wacky shows,

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,520
something about you.
People see you though.

154
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:45,200
What the fuck is this guy doing that 
follow you when you're walking through a

155
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:46,034
store.
I know there's a balance between that 

156
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,710
and then real disciplined people like,
you know,

157
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,740
fucking navy seal type cats.
You learn from them too.

158
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,660
Sure.
And you go well that you can incorporate

159
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:00,710
some of that into your life as well and 
it helps balance out all the wacky,

160
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,580
creative aspects of it and it makes you 
a little bit more productive,

161
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,850
a little bit happier,
little bit dead.

162
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:10,370
Prez had a um,
they had a song.

163
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,570
A discipline makes things easier to 
great fucking salt is,

164
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,420
it's a great song because it,
it's real.

165
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,910
It really does.
Discipline makes things easier.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,590
It Israel organize your life

167
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,230
like for me,
when I feel most,

168
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,951
of course,
you know,

169
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:28,784
because of how you live,
but your body feeds into your how your 

170
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:36,010
mind works when you,
what,

171
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,003
when I'm bored.
When I was talking about that now I'm 

172
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,060
horrible.
Negative years.

173
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:44,490
It was also dictated by terrible diet.
Terrible.

174
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:45,324
And you know,
not that I'm in great shape or anything 

175
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:49,850
now,
but I've changed things and I felt it up

176
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:51,650
here.
You know what I mean?

177
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,900
That's what people don't think.
You feel it in your brain.

178
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,370
I feel like a different person man.
After I,

179
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,820
after I spar a little bit or whatever it
is,

180
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,550
feel different.
I,

181
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,393
I,
I got more energy where you would think 

182
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,150
logic would dictate,
you would get tired.

183
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,120
I'm like,
now I'm ready to write now I'm crazy.

184
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:08,910
Right.
You know what I mean?

185
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,310
Counterintuitive.
It is.

186
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,960
It's.
But it's um,

187
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,370
but again,
like you said,

188
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:14,270
it's discipline.
I,

189
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,040
you know,
it's,

190
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,600
you know,
my mother's making gravy and meatballs.

191
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,940
It's hard to say.
Mike said,

192
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,173
settle down.

193
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,860
You got,
you can eat that once a week,

194
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,510
once a week you go home.
Just go whole hog gravy.

195
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:32,890
That's such an east coast Italian word.
My grandparents in New Jersey,

196
00:08:32,891 --> 00:08:33,724
it was gravy.
Apologize to everyone that's not in New 

197
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,960
York,
Philly and Jersey,

198
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:39,460
right?
Barely New York.

199
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,220
It's like it's not Manhattan.
They'll fight and they'll fight you.

200
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,450
They'll say,
it's sauce,

201
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,700
man.
Fucking crazy,

202
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,260
man.
It's not do this.

203
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,611
Yeah.
Gravies,

204
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,170
New Jersey,
New Jersey.

205
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:52,450
Like old school.
Italian soprano style.

206
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,060
That's gravy.
Philly's gravy.

207
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,130
Then you go south

208
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,840
of Philly.
Become sauce again.

209
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,830
Yes.
That's fucking good.

210
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,520
No matter what it is.
Good.

211
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,180
It's weird how like if you go to.
Have you been to Italy?

212
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,040
A lot of my families to lower there.
The food is fucking fantastic.

213
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,470
Next level,
but it's a different kind of food.

214
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,520
It's Italian Americans did.
Is,

215
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,650
is a totally different cuisine.
Yeah.

216
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,550
It's interesting,
right?

217
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,040
Is the meatballs,
the Lasagna,

218
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,730
they will put some shit in front of you.
You don't know what it is,

219
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:27,780
but.
All right,

220
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:28,900
let's have at it.
Yeah.

221
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:29,803
The Italian food in Italy is lighter.
It's a lot more fish and then you have 

222
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:35,754
the regions.
If you're north of your south of here 

223
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,141
and said,
Gee,

224
00:09:38,141 --> 00:09:39,610
if you know it's,
it's,

225
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,940
it's uh,
yeah,

226
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,660
it's,
it is odd.

227
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,763
It was culture shock just to think of 
what I've been eating for my mother's 

228
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,870
food and grandparents and you know what 
I mean?

229
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,280
And then it's like,
it's just different.

230
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,533
My grandmother was fresh off the boat 
and she used to cook everything from 

231
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:56,910
scratch,
tomato sauce from scratch,

232
00:09:56,911 --> 00:10:00,000
everything to pasta.
She would roll the pasta herself.

233
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,970
She read everything.
She would make her own bread.

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,550
She would do everything.
Everything from scratch.

235
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,563
The bread wasn't all there was.
The bread was occasional because a lot 

236
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:09,964
of the times there was a.
When they lived in New Jersey there was 

237
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,414
a store that they would go to a bread 
place that you would go and buy fresh 

238
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:18,330
bread basically every couple of days.
Sure.

239
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,273
And it would go bad,
like within hours because it was real 

240
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:23,443
bread without 8,000.
Now today I had a piece of bread the 

241
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:29,910
other day and it was sitting on the 
kitchen table for like a few hours.

242
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,953
I left,
I went back.

243
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,810
It was still soft as fuck because it's 
all filled with chemicals.

244
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,411
Horace,
man.

245
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:35,244
Everything is now.
Everything is what it's like when you 

246
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:41,960
realize that there's fluoride in our 
drinking water and people are just start

247
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,060
right with that.
I'm not sure that that's.

248
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,133
That should be there.
I've read that I read about Florida and 

249
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,540
a drink of water,
like the pros and cons.

250
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,140
The pros don't make any sense to me like
brush your fucking teeth.

251
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,460
Pitch use.
Yeah.

252
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,770
I'm not,
I'm the uh,

253
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,090
you know,
I'm not,

254
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,730
I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed,
but I don't think Andre.

255
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,810
Well it's,
you know,

256
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:08,130
and then you get into all the conspiracy
theories.

257
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:09,800
That's when you got to wade through all 
the bullshit.

258
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,643
Like,
okay,

259
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,020
it was a Nazi plot to soften minds and 
it wasn't.

260
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,133
Or was it just like,
I feel like somebody just got a lot of 

261
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:18,564
flora they're trying to sell and they've
got some sort of a deal with the 

262
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,130
government that's put into the wall.

263
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,150
It's probably more logical,
but the thing,

264
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,160
the thing is with all that conspiracy 
shit,

265
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,330
you have to sift through shit because 
there are kernels in their problem,

266
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,040
but they liked that.
They liked the more ridiculous,

267
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,533
the more ridiculous the theories,
the better it is for them because that 

268
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,610
it seems more ridiculous in that year 
alone.

269
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,410
Yeah,
and Oh,

270
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:44,244
you mean they're like the government,
but whoever is dumped on the floor or 

271
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,740
whoever they in bags of Florida.
Remember when your grandma used to say,

272
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,653
hey,
you go girl whose day they say that 

273
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,500
you're not.
Who's they?

274
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,540
Who are they?
But whoever that is,

275
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,660
whatever they're doing,
the more ridiculous things seem.

276
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,993
It.
It nullifies some more realistic things 

277
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:09,220
like pumping into food,
into cattle,

278
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,850
steroids in cattle.
Why?

279
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,960
Like for me,
when we were younger bro,

280
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:15,970
white girls didn't have fat ass.
Yeah,

281
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,140
but they learned squats.

282
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,520
You think that's what it is?
Do with cattle or.

283
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,720
I really don't.
If you think it's squashed.

284
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,430
A lot of white girls out there with flat
asses to this day,

285
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,470
they're just lazy.
All right,

286
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,580
I'm going to trust you because you and I
believe you.

287
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,340
You're a gym guy.
Most of what's going on with food is not

288
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:34,174
steroids.
Most of what's going on with food is 

289
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:37,900
antibiotics because they're getting sick
from eating corn.

290
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,160
Okay.
If you watch,

291
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,230
um,
there's a great documentary,

292
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:46,231
king corn and it all.
It documents how a lot of cows have huge

293
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:49,690
issues digesting all that corn.
It's not a natural thing for them.

294
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:50,950
They're supposed to eat grass.
Sure,

295
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,803
sure,
sure.

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,833
The fuck up and make some quite tasty.
But it's really not what they're 

297
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,980
supposed to be eating.
That's interesting.

298
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,733
I mean,
I guess I always started the chemically 

299
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,074
speaking that that's what was being 
pumped into everything now because it's 

300
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,460
expensive.

301
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,920
They don't need to do it either.
Like in Mexico,

302
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:09,754
they still do it.
That's how Canelo got paired with the 

303
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,980
clench and I air quote,
allegedly,

304
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,850
he got clipped things.
Clenbuterol came from mistake.

305
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,703
I got a fucking bridge,
but you can get it from mistake 

306
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,540
unfortunately.
Oh yeah.

307
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,980
No.
There's fighters that say,

308
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,600
oh no,
I trained them Mexican.

309
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,670
Someone recently said,
I don't see this fight.

310
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,590
I said,
yeah,

311
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,470
I eat it.
And it's got cleanliness.

312
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,990
And they're like,
the why didn't you get popped?

313
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:34,120
He's like,
because I don't inject it.

314
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,820
That was his line.
Well,

315
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:41,830
without a doubt,
there's some shenanigans going on in all

316
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,750
combat sports and all professional 
sports.

317
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,290
You get a little edge.
That's just the money involved.

318
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,880
Of course,
being able to,

319
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,400
you know,
and teddy loses his mind with that.

320
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,500
Rightly so when someone's that 
passionate about anything.

321
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,470
I mean the guy is just like,
Jesus man,

322
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,550
like said treasure.

323
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,230
He is.
He's an American treasure.

324
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,580
Yes.
Yes.

325
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,670
He was great man.
Stories about his dad.

326
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,020
You.
Did you hear it?

327
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,580
Did you hear the Pi?
Watched half of it,

328
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:13,180
but I read his book so far.
You know,

329
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:14,980
teddy bear.
Teddy was a goon man.

330
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,150
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

331
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:16,984
Well,
that's where he got that slice was 

332
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,780
hanging in.
His face was hanging off.

333
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah,
it's crazy.

334
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:21,791
Yeah.
But,

335
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,380
um,
yeah.

336
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,820
Well the Jordan Peterson,
but I mean,

337
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,910
I'm in awe of that guy.
Yeah.

338
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,070
He's a really,
really fascinating gentleman.

339
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:32,920
He is.
He is just scary.

340
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:33,820
Smart.
Yeah.

341
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,881
You know,
I,

342
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:35,900
I would,
I would,

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,280
I would just crumble,
trying to have a conversation with.

344
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,800
It wasn't just like a nitwit you would 
catch up.

345
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,920
That's what happened two days later,
my friends.

346
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,413
But the thing about people like that,
it's like if you are around a certain 

347
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,370
caliber thinker than your vibration

348
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,203
sort of matches their operation.
When you're around people that are way 

349
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,350
smarter than you,
you realize like,

350
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,240
oh,
there's some shortcuts to think and that

351
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,980
I'm taking.
And then there's some,

352
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,843
there's some pitfalls and the way I 
analyze things and these people don't 

353
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:07,730
have those things,
and then my vocabulary stunted.

354
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:10,770
Maybe I should increase my vocabulary.
It was just start reading more,

355
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,450
reading the things and that it just with
most people,

356
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,284
it's the same thing as with fitness,
it's amount of how much time you put in 

357
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:21,200
for how long and that's the same thing 
with your intellect.

358
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,840
It's the same thing with your emotional 
stability.

359
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,943
It's how much energy and effort and 
focus have you put into it and for how 

360
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,710
long?
Yeah,

361
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,770
of course.
No,

362
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,720
but like,
like you said though,

363
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,603
to be around someone like Kim,
you're naturally going to fall into a 

364
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:39,170
line of thinking where,
wow,

365
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,640
this guy's got his understanding of his 
calmness man.

366
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,520
It's like,
it's just,

367
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,670
I can't see that guy being rattled.
I've watched the debates and he's just,

368
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,120
he's so confident in what he believes,
you know what I'm saying?

369
00:15:56,241 --> 00:15:59,180
I started things through clearly not a 
silly person.

370
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,510
I think I am.
So that's the problem.

371
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,530
Yeah,
I am too.

372
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:03,380
Yeah.
I'm a nitwit.

373
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,770
So watching him,
it's,

374
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,770
it's,
you know,

375
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,663
it's um,
it's humbling to watch someone like him 

376
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:15,200
that's got it together and has that 
level of understanding because I spend a

377
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:18,740
lot of my life trying to get to that 
level of understanding.

378
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,970
So to watch someone that's there,
you know,

379
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,980
it's like,
it's just humbling to.

380
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,990
I'm just curious where he was going to 
go because him being known is relatively

381
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,050
new.
It's not.

382
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,130
This isn't a guy who's been,
you know,

383
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,330
a couple of years,
right.

384
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,820
When he said what you would call like a 
public superstar intellectual,

385
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,470
now that's a new thing.

386
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,333
It is really.
It really hasn't existed over the last 

387
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,230
decade or so.
It hasn't been,

388
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,153
and now they're starting and I think 
because of Youtube and podcasts and 

389
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,110
things along those lines,
these guys are getting super popular.

390
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:54,944
I mean,
he's selling out places where fucking 

391
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,150
iron maiden plays.
Absolutely.

392
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,960
Absolutely.
It's crazy.

393
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:04,260
And he talks about the book is,
if you told me that,

394
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,800
that a place where maiden would sell 
out,

395
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:09,400
someone will go talk to a modern day 
philosopher.

396
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,273
Yeah.
I wouldn't believe that because it's 

397
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,460
idiocracy now.
You know,

398
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:15,250
he only eats meat.
So he eats.

399
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,280
No.
Yeah,

400
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:18,110
he's on this carnivore diet.
Really?

401
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,710
No vegetables at all.
No salt in meat and water.

402
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,820
Wow.
Yeah,

403
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:23,654
he's so wacky with it.
He told me that he had like a glass of 

404
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:31,661
cider and he couldn't sleep for 24 days.
Like he's not okay.

405
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,680
He's eccentric.
Like in a heavy way.

406
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,270
He's a,
he's a heavy guy.

407
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,350
Yeah.
But,

408
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:40,190
um,
it's,

409
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,103
it's,
it's a burden being that guy as a 

410
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:43,334
burden.
Well,

411
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,263
now,
and I don't mean that in a negative or 

412
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,840
derogatory way.
I mean to be that smart.

413
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:49,720
And now don't you feel historically 
that,

414
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,430
that

415
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,430
they're the people who are the most sad 
and broken and as they know too much,

416
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,430
there's nothing worse than knowing shit.
The dumbest people I know are happy as a

417
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:05,700
fucking man.
It's an input people.

418
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,563
Sure,
and it's obviously his level of 

419
00:18:08,551 --> 00:18:09,384
intellect is next level,
but even being a bright guy or seeing 

420
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,663
just being a rita or or,
or reading Kafka and Salinger and 

421
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,303
whoever,
and just becoming aware of certain 

422
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,004
things.
You realize certain times realizations 

423
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,774
are always the greatest things.
I used to teach that to kids when I was 

424
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:33,710
coaching them.
When I was coaching a martial artists.

425
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:36,480
I would say,
you're scared because you're smart.

426
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,413
Yeah.
See these people around you that aren't 

427
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,090
scared.
They're stupid.

428
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,403
They don't understand the possibilities.
You're aware of the dangers and all the 

429
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:44,424
variables.
You've got to put that aside and just 

430
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,690
constantly trade on your technique and 
your task at hand.

431
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,390
But the reason why you're scared is 
because you're smart.

432
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,230
Everything.
My life exists around fear.

433
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,020
It's not good.
It's not healthy.

434
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:01,830
I'm not healthy mentally because of it 
and I don't know how to shake that,

435
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,890
but it's what kind of fear.
Um,

436
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,340
my father died when I was 10,
so I have the,

437
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,780
like Mr.
my mom's my best friend,

438
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,060
you know,
and she's 72 now.

439
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,750
So like just everyday is worried about 
her,

440
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,243
about in every way.
It's not even driven by anything that 

441
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,440
rational.
It's like she's sick,

442
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,300
she's the best,
you know what I mean?

443
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:26,760
She's 72.
Listen to Jay Z and wears Jordans.

444
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,200
Does she?
She's,

445
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,393
she's the best,
but it's just a long of course I to get 

446
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:34,614
a video.
Yeah,

447
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,360
no problem.
No,

448
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,480
but it's fear of not having her fear of 
the unknown.

449
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:44,850
I really,
I fear the unknown.

450
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,560
I fear what if this all ends?

451
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,010
I've lived.
I've,

452
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,790
uh,
my adult life has been what I do,

453
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,190
which is music.
It's yours has been true.

454
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:54,024
I don't,
but I don't know how to do anything 

455
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,720
right.
I don't know how to fix the fucking car.

456
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,970
I was like,
I can't,

457
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,150
I don't know how to do.
I literally don't have to do anything.

458
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,790
But that fears for mechanics too,
because they're like,

459
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,110
fuck,
what if there's no more cars?

460
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,720
What if these electric cars come along?
I don't know how to work a computer.

461
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,460
Everything's going to be computer 
controlled.

462
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,593
I mean the people's business.
Who can think about the poor bastard 

463
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:16,080
that opened up blockbuster.
He's like,

464
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,990
we got this.
We got to go last forever.

465
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:20,250
Right?
He just spending money,

466
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:21,540
like it's crawling them one day.
They're like,

467
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,261
oh,
we got this,

468
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:23,190
uh,
this new thing.

469
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:25,800
It's called a of the apple TV.

470
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,270
People like,
fuck appletv.

471
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,163
Yeah.
Mindset going.

472
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,273
Michael.
Blockbuster is not living in a box 

473
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:31,660
somewhere,
right?

474
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,220
They'll probably.
Paul,

475
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,940
you probably sold for smart and probably
saw the writing on the wall.

476
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,320
Yeah.
But I mean,

477
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:40,620
there's a lot of things that just go 
away and people find a way to make.

478
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:43,980
Do you get through whatever made you a 
successful rapper?

479
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,310
You could be successful at anything.
I don't know that I want that.

480
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,050
Well,
you don't have to.

481
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:52,610
Luckily I don't.
I don't want to be a.

482
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,710
I don't want either.
I don't want the.

483
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,480
The fear of not being able to continue 
the way I continue.

484
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,120
I know again,
from being a fan how you look,

485
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,630
you do what you want.
Essentially.

486
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,580
Of course work is work and even though 
we love it,

487
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:10,414
it's still working.
I think we both had people in our lives 

488
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:12,994
that don't get that.

489
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,220
They think that it's what,
when we talk,

490
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:16,054
when you were in Philly,
I know people hit you up the day of the 

491
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,290
show.
Can you get me to patches back?

492
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,110
But like it's a fucking body.
It's your job,

493
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:23,944
man.
It's,

494
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,500
it's how you,
it's how you,

495
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:26,443
you know what I mean?
Put food on the table and I think 

496
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,014
there's a disconnect there with people 
that don't live in that world that they 

497
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:37,720
think everything we do is have a party.
I'm sorry,

498
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,554
it goes back to discipline.
We were talking about earlier that you 

499
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,580
got to love it,
but you also have to have the discipline

500
00:21:42,581 --> 00:21:44,020
to get the work done.
Of course,

501
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,130
you know,
of course,

502
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,383
but I,
I have a problem with people that don't 

503
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:52,240
understand that,
that there is discipline involved.

504
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,103
They think that there's not that we got 
lucky we didn't when we did and we 

505
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:58,834
didn't.

506
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,220
We did get lucky.
We created.

507
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,780
We created our own luck though.
There's a little bit of that for sure.

508
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,910
We're lucky.
We live in America.

509
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,320
We weren't born in the shack and sure 
there's luck,

510
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,090
but then there's also you have to put in
the work and you have to figure it out.

511
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,580
It's a puzzle.
It's just open ended puzzle.

512
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,520
You make what you make it.
You turn it into something,

513
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:23,320
but you did it.
You did it.

514
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,213
You started,
you got your shot and you took it and 

515
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,250
had the balls to run with that shot.
Some people fumble the ball.

516
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,020
The death is a lot of fumblers out 
there.

517
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,330
Then I fumbled a bunch to.
Do you just get back up.

518
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,100
I figured out why you fumbled.
I fumbled,

519
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:38,970
but I knew that I had to get back up.
These people found,

520
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,590
fumbled the ball and then go into a woe 
is me,

521
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,490
woe is me.

522
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,080
The Universe is out to get me.
I can't catch a break.

523
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,470
This doesn't and that's all.
I can't say all,

524
00:22:50,471 --> 00:22:52,540
but a lot of it is self inflicted.
Yeah,

525
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,171
it is.
Well,

526
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,420
instead of looking at that way,
what they should look at it.

527
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:57,430
Okay,
now I know how not to do it.

528
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,800
I learned,
now this is going to make me better.

529
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,663
You have to learn.
You have to learn from everything that 

530
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,610
happens.
If you're not,

531
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,033
it's your.
My father would say it's not a mistake 

532
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:08,260
if you learn from it.
Yeah.

533
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,330
You have to be able to look.
It's adapt or die.

534
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:14,350
Like what?
Blockbuster.

535
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,610
Right,
so adapt or die.

536
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,850
Everything's changing with us.
You know what I mean?

537
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,420
The podcast is bigger than shows on 
terrestrial radio.

538
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:25,450
If you told me that back when I was 
listening to the Stern,

539
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,284
I'd be like,
why are you even talking about the 

540
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,350
podcast?
Could not.

541
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,453
What is a podcast?
How big could that be in your bigger 

542
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:33,450
than radio?
What person?

543
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,170
Well,
I thought that when I did it too,

544
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:38,470
when I first started doing it,
I never thought it was gonna be a thing.

545
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,780
I thought it was just a goof.
I was doing it for fun.

546
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:41,614
Right?
Like I would respond to someone on 

547
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:44,230
twitter,
like just fuck it.

548
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,680
Just have some fun.
Yeah,

549
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,190
and it.

550
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:48,530
But you,
you change culture.

551
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,220
You've shifted culture and how people 
communicate with this show.

552
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,553
I mean,
you should be very proud of that man if 

553
00:23:54,441 --> 00:23:56,300
you're not already.
I don't think about it.

554
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,810
I think if you think about it,
you'll trip over your own feet.

555
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,673
I don't think about it.
If someone could give me the best 

556
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:03,860
compliment ever and I'm like,
I'm a piece of garbage.

557
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,820
You're better off that way.
I don't trust Joe.

558
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,703
We don't have a problem.
They're like you were saying about your 

559
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:14,660
fear of it all going away.
I think that fear is what makes you show

560
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,140
up at the studio 10 minutes early.
That fear is what makes you get out that

561
00:24:18,141 --> 00:24:19,700
notebook and start writing.
Yeah.

562
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,593
That fear is what makes you sit alone 
thinking about how you're gonna 

563
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,930
structure this or you know,
write your next this or that's,

564
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,580
that's it's all important.

565
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,563
People think that like,
like a guy like you who's a successful 

566
00:24:32,541 --> 00:24:37,010
rapper or a comedian that's successful 
that you just got no worries anymore.

567
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,023
That's bullshit.
I have more worries now that I've ever 

568
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:41,080
had in my life.
I have way more worries.

569
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,933
The one I had nothing in my pocket and 
high school and I was rapping on street 

570
00:24:44,391 --> 00:24:45,224
corners.
I think about it all the time at Howard 

571
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,763
that and now I look at the worries I had
then and that laughable I ground right 

572
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,950
crack at the shit that used to,
used to bother me.

573
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:55,911
You know,
What's interesting?

574
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,250
Could you imagine going back to the 
first day,

575
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:00,920
starting from scratch,
knowing what you know now,

576
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,120
how much better you would be.
Right?

577
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,650
I can't even imagine.
Think of that in the future as of now.

578
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,220
That's a heavy,
that's heavy.

579
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:11,800
You know,
if I look back on yourself,

580
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,880
like if you're a 60 year old man looking
back at yourself,

581
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:17,330
you're like,
vinny had the world by the balls.

582
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,190
Of course the problem is,
um,

583
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,940
I have a problem with living in the 
moment.

584
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,373
I'm always thinking about the 
ramifications of that moment while the 

585
00:25:27,681 --> 00:25:29,600
moment is happening.
Yeah.

586
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,890
And it's,
it's,

587
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,750
it's,
um,

588
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,160
it's detrimental to my mental health to 
think that way.

589
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,050
You know what I mean?
I know I can't,

590
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,610
I see people live in the moment,
I see people that just are able to,

591
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,733
to let things wash over them and I'm 
envious of that because everything is 

592
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,860
overanalyzing and every way possible and
it eats at me,

593
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,410
you know,
and,

594
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,160
but I think that that's one of the 
reasons why your lyrics are so good.

595
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,180
It's like a person,
a person has that sort of the,

596
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,990
the,
the,

597
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:03,823
this,
the over analyzing aspect of you is 

598
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:06,944
also,
it makes you go over all these details 

599
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,760
and find better hooks and find a better 
way to phrase things.

600
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,160
And this is like,
you can't be complacent.

601
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:16,994
You just can't.
I just wish I could just only exist in 

602
00:26:18,951 --> 00:26:21,350
that place.
I don't think it works,

603
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:22,460
man.
Everybody that I talked to,

604
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:25,130
the successful is the same way.
They're all a mess.

605
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,710
Yeah.
What are we going to do about that?

606
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,450
I just gotTa keep fucking.
You just got to not give a fuck and keep

607
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:35,330
pressing forward and know that this is 
just part of who you are.

608
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,960
I mean if we go back historically,
everyone's alone.

609
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,760
That was brilliant.
Atlanta and like,

610
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,320
look at all these,
you know what I'm saying?

611
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:45,420
I'm crazy comic that's ever lived on.
Craziest fuck.

612
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:46,254
I think Stan hopes one of the brilliant,
most brilliant minds ever bat shit 

613
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,130
crazy.
You know,

614
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,530
he's a good buddy of mine.
He is,

615
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,950
um,
you know,

616
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:55,010
you look at,
you know,

617
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,060
whether it's Bill Hicks,
whether it's Louis,

618
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:58,150
whoever,
you know what I mean?

619
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,641
Yeah.
I mean,

620
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:01,170
Sam was the most troubled person.
Well,

621
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,030
that's my defensive Roseanne.
You know,

622
00:27:03,031 --> 00:27:04,620
all these people coming after Rosanna.
I'm like,

623
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,120
you don't understand.
She's Batshit.

624
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,060
She's not just batshit.
She got in a car accident.

625
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,250
He,
she had severe brain damage.

626
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:13,340
Yeah.
She's on all sorts of medications.

627
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:16,020
He has multiple personality disorder.
She's drinking.

628
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:18,300
She's on Ambien and she's seven years 
old.

629
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,550
What the fuck do you want?
Right?

630
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:24,420
They want from this lady you,
you spoke that way.

631
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:25,254
And so did norm.
Norm talked about Louie and Rosanna and 

632
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,880
the same way you like,
Yo,

633
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,010
man,
she's batshit crazy.

634
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:34,530
First of all,
if you're going to her for,

635
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,400
for uh,
uh,

636
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,373
you know,
if you're going to her for political 

637
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:40,104
discourse,
you might want to reevaluate your life 

638
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,820
problems on you.
Yeah.

639
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,340
That's your fault.
Yeah.

640
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,593
Yeah.
And that doesn't mean either one of us 

641
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:50,700
agree with exactly what you wrote.

642
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,960
It's just how she got there.
But that's also why she's so funny.

643
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,420
You know,
if you go back and watch Roseanne in the

644
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,660
early days,
that show was fucking heavy and it was a

645
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:03,420
great show and her standup before,
even before,

646
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:07,540
that was fantastic.
I put her in the top 20 of all time.

647
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:09,210
She was brilliant.
She was brilliant.

648
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:12,390
But it's also a monster man.
Like there was nobody like her before.

649
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,220
Like she was just as brash.
I don't gather five.

650
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,990
Yep.
She was like a man he'll like,

651
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:19,970
like a,
like,

652
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,530
like a world class standard.
Sure.

653
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,680
I mean I remember like when that show 
came on,

654
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:26,514
just seeing that house as,
I've never seen a house like that on 

655
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:31,070
television.
You know what I mean?

656
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:34,940
Like closer to what we knew then what I 
had ever seen.

657
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,320
I my house didn't look like the kinds of
bees,

658
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,490
you know what I mean?

659
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,760
I was maybe archie bunker,
you know,

660
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:41,594
it was like a little bit closer,
but it's when people are batshit crazy 

661
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,300
and someone reacts to that with 
confusion,

662
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,470
not confusion with contempt.
I'm like,

663
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:53,304
you understand?
They're batshit crazy and it's part of 

664
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:58,160
why they got to where they're at.
Yeah.

665
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,183
Don't,
don't act surprised now that someone 

666
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:04,770
said something looney yeah.
This many years after.

667
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,653
You know what I mean?
It just seemed strange to me that now 

668
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,720
you're blown away.
She's been saying bad shit.

669
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:10,554
Crazy shit for a long time.
I think it's also part of this new 

670
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:16,380
culture that we have in where people 
just,

671
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,400
they find a target and they attack.
Of course.

672
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:21,240
It's like if,
if you have,

673
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:22,883
if there's any sort of weakness,
like if you have chickens and one 

674
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:29,610
chicken gets sick,
that's what that pecking order thing is.

675
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,930
Sean chicken doesn't feel good.

676
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,370
The other chickens,
they don't,

677
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,090
they don't like make moral judgments on 
this chicken.

678
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:39,150
They just find a target.
So along with that chicken.

679
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:40,480
So they start fucking it up.
Right.

680
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,580
And it happens with dogs.
It,

681
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,540
it's a,
it's an animal thing in human beings.

682
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,550
We have to,
if we're going to be real,

683
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,100
if we're gonna,
if we're going to be compassionate,

684
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:53,230
we're really going to be compassionate.
If we're really gonna,

685
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,970
like try to engineer a better culture 
and a better community.

686
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,070
We got to stop doing that.
I agree.

687
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,700
We've got to just stop attacking people.
Like she didn't.

688
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,700
I believe I talked to her on the phone.
Just me and her.

689
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,830
She did not know that lady was black.
I know that lady.

690
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,100
She goes,
she looked Jewish.

691
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,160
She looks like me.
She just,

692
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,570
when she said I believe you.
I believe her too.

693
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,130
I think she was just cracking a joke.

694
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,430
Fucked up on Ambien and drinking and 
smoking weed all night.

695
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:24,760
And.
But no one cares what her intent was.

696
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:26,650
All they care is.
I got a green light.

697
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,530
That's a target we're going to go in.
Well,

698
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:34,040
here's my issue with the modern.
The modern left is,

699
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,520
is they taught compassion,
but they pounce.

700
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,863
It's,
I feel like a man with no country now 

701
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,700
too,
because I don't,

702
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,713
I don't.
The modern left isn't something that I 

703
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:47,314
gravitate towards and neither is the 
right and when I was growing up and 

704
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:53,130
listening to public enemy,
you know,

705
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:58,150
at the end that left of it changed.
It changed and I didn't.

706
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,360
Yeah,
yeah,

707
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,680
yeah.
And you and you have these people.

708
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,970
Um,
I don't know where I stand anymore,

709
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:10,804
man.
I think there's this rational left 

710
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:14,344
leaning people that are against 
discrimination and for welfare and for 

711
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:19,721
food.
I look,

712
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:21,250
I was on welfare when I was a kid.

713
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,010
If people say I shouldn't be on welfare,
well what the fuck?

714
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,970
Right.
My parents were on welfare.

715
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,833
All came from a poor family.
So we had food stamps and eventually 

716
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,980
they did better and we got off of it.
But if you want to tell me that,

717
00:31:32,981 --> 00:31:35,210
that doesn't help,
that fed me absolute.

718
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:38,890
So how could I ever go against that?
And that was a part of my childhood.

719
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,840
I think all these things that people 
want to associate with being,

720
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,210
you know,
like with left or right.

721
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,410
I think there's just a gigantic problem 
with pink people being tribal.

722
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,620
That's what it is.
It's tribalism at its,

723
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,310
at its highest degree,
which in since I've been alive,

724
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,233
I haven't seen it.
Never seen it like this before and I 

725
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:01,570
think we know why,
but.

726
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,860
Well it's facilitated not just by trump 
and,

727
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,880
but it's also by the ability to 
communicate instantaneously.

728
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,950
Of course,
without any consideration,

729
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,893
you can just tweet something or make a 
youtube video about something 

730
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:13,180
instantaneously.
Sure.

731
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,670
Roseanne's ability to tweet that.
Yeah.

732
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:21,030
That quickly with the phone is why 
Sankar show cost millions of dollars.

733
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,720
People lost their jobs.
ABC Junk,

734
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,360
you know,
it's either going to do the connors,

735
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,580
guess what?
That show's gonna fucking sink.

736
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:28,414
Like the titanic course.
It's combined Roseanna Roseanne with 

737
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,460
Roseanne,
right?

738
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,840
Three episodes.
That's like flavor free diet coke,

739
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,010
tastes like water,
just

740
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,010
have water motherfucker.
It's diet coke,

741
00:32:45,301 --> 00:32:49,610
but without the flavor what?
It's true and I don't.

742
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,093
It's just,
it's,

743
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,220
it's the hypersensitivity and it's like 
the ability for anyone right or wrong to

744
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,150
be able to say something right.
Then where you would have,

745
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,410
you know,
if,

746
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,160
if you're doing fear factor in rolling 
stone interviewed you,

747
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,190
there's a thought process there and 
there's editing and you're sitting there

748
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:12,410
and you're talking with a journalist.
All of that's gone,

749
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:13,244
man.
It's like it that that's what it's come 

750
00:33:16,341 --> 00:33:17,420
down to.
You know,

751
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,283
we're all,
we,

752
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,183
all three of us had phones in our 
pockets and can see something crazy 

753
00:33:20,961 --> 00:33:23,430
right now.
If we stubbed our toe right,

754
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,310
studied y'all,
fuck this,

755
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,000
blah,
blah blah,

756
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,630
and all the sudden you had done your son
is

757
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,573
good in that because the tyranny of 
these gigantic organizations like if 

758
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:34,560
they were tyrannical,
if they did have an agenda,

759
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:36,470
if you we're trying to smear you,
you are fucked.

760
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:39,140
You had no recourse and they did that.
Too many people.

761
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,080
I'm sure there's unscrupulous 
journalists,

762
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,080
but also journalistic integrity takes a 
backseat to.

763
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,230
Because now they have to get clicks.
Like these people are real.

764
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:50,240
Journalists are fighting for their 
lives.

765
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,700
Absolutely.
Because these publications going under

766
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,190
real journalism is almost dead.
It's not totally dead,

767
00:33:56,191 --> 00:33:58,210
but it's bad.
It's hurt.

768
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,310
But like I was of Emphysema,
like Alex Jones thing,

769
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:03,144
right?
Whether I agree with shit he says are 

770
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:09,081
not corporations shut him down and that 
to me that's scary that the corporations

771
00:34:11,641 --> 00:34:16,641
can decide what we are able to hear 
really

772
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,913
well.
I was having a good conversation about 

773
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:19,504
this last night with some friends and 
they were talking about whether or not 

774
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,103
things like youtube or twitter or 
instagram should be regulated like 

775
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:29,420
utilities where anybody can use it.
You know,

776
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,690
like you have the right to get the 
power.

777
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,000
Like if you have,
if you have a house,

778
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,190
you're.
You have the right to pay your money,

779
00:34:36,191 --> 00:34:38,350
you get your power turned on.
It's a utility.

780
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:41,230
Yes.
Maybe a channel like that,

781
00:34:41,231 --> 00:34:43,930
whether it's youtube or whether it's 
twitter,

782
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,020
maybe a channel should be treated like a
utility,

783
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,183
but then the question is like,
what is it exactly that is good enough 

784
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:55,420
to get you kicked off?
Because I've seen some horrible shit.

785
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,840
I want people to read or written rather 
on twitter that.

786
00:34:58,841 --> 00:34:59,674
And they're still on.

787
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,060
I've seen shit,
whatever.

788
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,250
He's being,
whatever.

789
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,790
You know why he was brought down.
I've seen people say much worse

790
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,203
was the sandy hook and it was that the 
sandy hook thing was he said that he 

791
00:35:15,561 --> 00:35:18,320
thought that it was fake.
He sends disavowed that,

792
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,330
but they don't care if you disavow 
things.

793
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,230
They have this thing on you now.
You said that the kids didn't die.

794
00:35:24,231 --> 00:35:26,150
They definitely did.
Let's get rid of you.

795
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,200
But are you saying that people aren't 
allowed to make mistakes?

796
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,110
Are you saying that people aren't 
allowed to evolve their thinking?

797
00:35:33,111 --> 00:35:33,944
Are you saying that people aren't 
allowed to say things that are wrong 

798
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,920
because a lot of people say things in a 
wrong,

799
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,410
but is it only things that are wrong 
about children?

800
00:35:40,411 --> 00:35:41,244
Like where is the line where lines are 
anymore and I don't know who's the one 

801
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:46,410
drawing?
Well,

802
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:51,411
it's these people that either are the 
ceos or the stockholders or the CFO's,

803
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,003
whoever it is that that is in the 
meeting that's dictating these 

804
00:35:55,861 --> 00:35:56,694
standards.

805
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,593
They're deciding these are gigantic 
corporations that we were just talking 

806
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:01,344
about this.
I don't think they ever anticipated 

807
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:04,464
this.
I think when they made twitter they 

808
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:06,630
thought it would be.
Like Jamie was saying,

809
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,330
it was a fun way to like tell your 
friends,

810
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,780
you know Vinny Paz and Joe Rogan.
I go into the movies.

811
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,070
Sure.
And that's what you would do.

812
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:15,690
Twitter was,
it was just like,

813
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:16,440
I'm,
I'm,

814
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,810
I'm eating pizza at the mall.
Yeah.

815
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:18,683
It wasn't anything crazy.
And then people started using as a 

816
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:21,744
platform for.
I know why Sam Harris has been tweeting 

817
00:36:25,381 --> 00:36:26,214
to Jack.
He's been trying to get Jack to ban 

818
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,520
trump.
He's like,

819
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,390
look,
he's like,

820
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:33,180
he's clearly violating your standards of
practice.

821
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,730
It's clearly doing that.
And he's like,

822
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:37,290
Jack just won't respond to him anymore.

823
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,860
Wow.
Radio silence radio.

824
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,630
He's like,
fuck this.

825
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,950
I don't need to deal with this in my 
life.

826
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,350
I mean,
you don't want to do that right now.

827
00:36:47,351 --> 00:36:49,100
Maybe when he gets impeached then your 
band,

828
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,353
y'all read that guy's twitter.
The fact that he's the leader of the 

829
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:59,420
free world is bat shit crazy with 
losers.

830
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,210
Yes.
These are the fi world calls people,

831
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,240
losers threatening nuclear war.
I love.

832
00:37:04,241 --> 00:37:05,074
Um,
my favorite is very sad with the 

833
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,880
exclamation.
All caps.

834
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,360
Yes.
That's like my.

835
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,313
That's my favorite thing.
If we get through this without getting 

836
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:15,844
blown up,
we're going to look back and laugh at 

837
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:18,550
the trump days.
They're going to be fun.

838
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,583
I'm just,
I don't know how long we're end to his 

839
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:21,964
presidency,
but when I walked by the TV and hear 

840
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:26,530
someone say president trump,
I still have a little,

841
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,710
you know,
it might not be,

842
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,180
it might not be a belly laugh,
but I still crack up.

843
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,630
Well it's been two years because my lap,
that's how I know.

844
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:37,464
I know by Netflix specials because my 
last netflix special was exactly two 

845
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:43,740
years ago and during that special I was 
like,

846
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:46,860
we are that close to president trump.
And people are laughing like,

847
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,670
ha ha.

848
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,640
I was laughing.
I was like,

849
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,690
I went to bed or whatever,
whatever.

850
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,610
Knowing that there was zero chance.
Yeah.

851
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:55,483
You know,
and I didn't think Hillary was a great 

852
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:57,284
candidate,
but I thought of fucking cardboard box 

853
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,940
would beat him.
Yeah.

854
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:02,830
I thought people would.

855
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,020
I think of him as more of a liability 
than anything.

856
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:08,170
But the thing is this,
people in Middle America just don't feel

857
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:09,004
represented.
They feel disrespected and not 

858
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:13,980
represented.
And he figured that out and tapped into.

859
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,963
I did well,
I saw Jordan Peterson say something in 

860
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:21,900
this interview and it made me think 
because obviously with joking right now,

861
00:38:21,901 --> 00:38:26,270
and the joke about him and south dummy 
isn't Jordan Peterson said the bit,

862
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,203
the reason he's in and the biggest 
mistake Americans have made is 

863
00:38:30,601 --> 00:38:32,800
underestimating him and thinking he's 
dumb.

864
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,260
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

865
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,850
Dumb.
He just does dumb shit.

866
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,980
Yes.
And he's definitely an EGOMANIAC.

867
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,093
He,
I think he has narcissistic personality 

868
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:43,960
disorder and that's that.
But that doesn't mean you're stupid.

869
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,090
You know what I mean?
But he,

870
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:49,800
it.

871
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,860
He took advantage of exactly what you 
said.

872
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,710
There's a big portion of this country.
You've been there.

873
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,170
I've been there.
There's where you're an east coast guy.

874
00:38:58,171 --> 00:39:00,990
I'm an east coast guy now.
We're both on the west coast.

875
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:02,910
We,
because of what we do,

876
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:03,744
these are the worlds we know and what 
we're surrounded by and that my father 

877
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:09,480
used to say,
if you don't live near a coast,

878
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:14,220
you're a retard.
Don't have to come in the more than half

879
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,480
the country hates me.
I don't believe that,

880
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:16,770
but my father said that.
But anyway,

881
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:22,370
and when you go through the middle of 
the country on tour and you meet people,

882
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:24,320
I've been like,
Yo,

883
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:27,060
I've never met anyone like this before.
Not In a good way or bad way.

884
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,693
You're not around them,
around them and they probably feel like 

885
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,880
no one has ever spoken for me.
Yeah.

886
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,970
You know what I mean?
And even if a dimwit does,

887
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,190
that's better than no one's speaking for
me.

888
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,043
Right.
That's better than someone just calling 

889
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:44,920
them fly overstays disrespect.
No,

890
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:46,350
of course,
of course.

891
00:39:46,351 --> 00:39:47,640
And I,
and when I was younger,

892
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:49,390
I did it too.
I talked that way.

893
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,353
I went towards,
we get booked or I don't want to go 

894
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,830
there and go,
let's just use it.

895
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:55,080
Just,
um,

896
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,960
it's ego of being where you're from,
from the east coat.

897
00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:58,794
Well,
obviously everyone on the east coast is 

898
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:03,570
very proud of that fact that everyone in
the West is very proud of that fact.

899
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:04,404
You know,
it's just,

900
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,390
you know,
I don't,

901
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,340
I don't,
I don't know anything about Arkansas,

902
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,610
you know,
and just not able to.

903
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,410
It's because they just don't know anyone
there all,

904
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,660
there's no fucking Italians.
They,

905
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,240
I don't know what I am.
I'm a while my family from Italy,

906
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,840
you know,
so like it's just not able to.

907
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,723
And it's being an ignorant American.
I spent a lot of time like that until I 

908
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:27,150
saw the world,
not the country,

909
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:31,200
the world and,
and being on different continents.

910
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:33,000
It,
it changes your thinking man.

911
00:40:33,001 --> 00:40:33,834
And you know,
the thing you were talking about with 

912
00:40:35,551 --> 00:40:38,160
Diet and discipline,
like you know,

913
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,740
these people run,
walk,

914
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:42,420
walk everywhere,
run everywhere,

915
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:43,680
right?
Bikes everywhere.

916
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Mcdonald's is eating like once a year as
a crazy night out.

917
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:51,620
Like my son lives overseas,
you know,

918
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,130
he's had Mcdonald's like three times in 
his life,

919
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,350
you know,
a little kids here.

920
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,383
It's like every day mommy,
chicken mcnuggets you see cultural 

921
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:05,690
shifts and,
and why there's no,

922
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,930
like I've talked to people over there 
who didn't know what autism was.

923
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:13,610
They never heard of it.
Legitimately.

924
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:14,444
Like what is that?
And I had to explain it and that shit 

925
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:18,020
got me thinking too.
It's like,

926
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,160
okay,
well why?

927
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,320
Why?
Why is.

928
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:26,530
Why is that not happening there?
What could be the reason autism,

929
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,820
autism,
autism,

930
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,340
autism.
Autism.

931
00:41:31,341 --> 00:41:32,081
Yes.
Oh,

932
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:32,980
the disease?
Yes.

933
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,420
Okay.
I thought you said an artist

934
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,180
or.
I'm sorry.

935
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,320
I was like,
what is that?

936
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:37,200
I don't know what it is.
Either.

937
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:39,730
Shit,
you want to let you.

938
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:40,900
You're looking at me like.
I'm trying to think.

939
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,650
I thought I was trying to figure out if 
you met artisan handcraft.

940
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,411
Yes.
Yes.

941
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:46,820
Autism.
Autism.

942
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,020
Yeah.
It's that accent pro.

943
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,380
Sorry.
No,

944
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,490
but yeah.
Well you know,

945
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,570
it's more common I think now than ever 
before.

946
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:57,404
But the question is whether it's more 
common because it's more diagnosed or 

947
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:03,380
whether it's more common because there's
more incidents of it.

948
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,500
Yeah,
there's a lot of questions as to why one

949
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:09,350
of the big ones is apparently older 
people having kids,

950
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:13,220
people waiting and putting off the 
children and particularly men.

951
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,290
Apparently there's a big risk for older 
men,

952
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,390
older men,
a lot of times have autistic kids.

953
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:21,500
I have more than a couple of friends 
with autistic children.

954
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,343
Me Too.
And,

955
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,193
and,
uh,

956
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,090
I just it like.

957
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:26,923
Do you remember when we were younger?
But I think like the first time I even 

958
00:42:29,271 --> 00:42:31,310
was aware it was probably the movie rain
man.

959
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,970
Yeah.
My being funny about two percent.

960
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,873
First Time I was aware they didn't exist
and wasn't diagnosed or something about 

961
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:38,984
it.
I don't think they made it up for the 

962
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:40,960
movie.
It's like the disease came along.

963
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,023
Right,
right,

964
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,040
right.
But,

965
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:47,360
but what happened,
what happened to Kevin is a chemical.

966
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:48,194
Is it people that were on drugs?
Is it things or did it just wasn't 

967
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,810
undiagnosed?
I think there's a bunch of factors.

968
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:57,644
I think undiagnosed is one of them.
I think also the ability to exchange 

969
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:01,214
information now allows you to be aware 
of it much quicker because of the 

970
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:04,784
Internet,
because people text and tweet and do 

971
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:10,310
these things on phones now you hear 
conversations about autism and all these

972
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:11,900
different things that you don't hear 
about before.

973
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,570
And then I think it's entirely possible 
that.

974
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,493
Well,
first of all there's definitely more 

975
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:16,904
people show than ever before.
So because of more people are going to 

976
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:21,200
have more incidences of all sorts of 
diseases,

977
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,510
cancer,
whatever it is that the question is,

978
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,960
is it more per capita or is it more 
period?

979
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,240
Because there's more people now I don't 
know the answer.

980
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:30,703
Well,
what you said about more knowledge and 

981
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:33,260
information,
being able to be shit.

982
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,980
I have a dissociative disorder.
It's called depersonalization disorder.

983
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,873
What does that do?
So basically I'll be sitting here 

984
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:43,530
talking to you and I'll just.
My body,

985
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,810
my mind,
my mind,

986
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:46,940
body and soul will remove itself from my
body.

987
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:49,130
I feel like I'm floating down over my 
body.

988
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,710
I look at my hands and they won't feel 
like mine.

989
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,030
Do you smoke weed?
No.

990
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,380
That's the problem.
It'll,

991
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,283
it'll trigger it.

992
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,590
Well,
yes.

993
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,030
Alright,
now if we got high,

994
00:43:59,090 --> 00:43:59,923
you float above yourself.
I would fucking take that deer head and 

995
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,083
put it through my ear.
I was lose my shit and I'm really 

996
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:09,644
envious.
I'm envious of how weed has helped so 

997
00:44:12,471 --> 00:44:14,940
many people and that it can help me.
Um,

998
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,130
what does it do to you?
It makes me be I smoked when I was young

999
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,170
and what happened was something triggers
a dpd and people.

1000
00:44:24,171 --> 00:44:25,520
It's a,
you know,

1001
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,070
it could be a traumatic event,
it could be ptsd.

1002
00:44:28,071 --> 00:44:29,960
You know what I'm saying?
Gun To my head,

1003
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:31,950
I would say it was my father dying,
but it

1004
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,813
didn't happen right away because he died
when I was 10 and it started when I was 

1005
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:37,860
14.
I smoked a blunt and dust.

1006
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,220
Oh yeah.
And lost my shit.

1007
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:46,221
And for about 18 months I know lie.
I thought I was in purgatory.

1008
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,800
Whoa.
How old are you?

1009
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,210
14.
I was like,

1010
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:54,330
I'm definitely not now.
I'm definitely not in heaven.

1011
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:56,820
Whatever those might be.
Wow.

1012
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:58,440
Yo Man,
this is.

1013
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,333
So.
This is back then there is no twitter 

1014
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:01,833
and I didn't even know what it was.
I went to a doctor and told him what 

1015
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:06,210
happened.
He was like,

1016
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:06,700
oh,
it was,

1017
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,010
it was what you smoked,
you know,

1018
00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:09,750
don't,
don't do that again.

1019
00:45:09,751 --> 00:45:12,320
And they never left.
And then I get these episodes out.

1020
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:15,660
I'll be in the shower on tour and the 
Czech Republic,

1021
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,030
washing my hair,
closing my eyes,

1022
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:19,590
and I opened them and not know where I'm
at.

1023
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,290
No clue where I'm at and I feel like I'm
floating outside of my body,

1024
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:25,793
you know,
when you would hear the stories of 

1025
00:45:26,551 --> 00:45:28,320
people dying in an outer body 
experience,

1026
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,190
that's literally my disorder.
I hadn't thought about experience once I

1027
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:34,230
took Salvia.
It was like,

1028
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,163
oh,
I was over here like floating above my 

1029
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,670
pulse.
Were you scared about myself now?

1030
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:41,340
I was tripping balls.
Yes,

1031
00:45:41,341 --> 00:45:42,720
I get it.
I think.

1032
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,540
I think it's it,
like I'm doing the Fred Sanford,

1033
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:46,720
Elizabeth.
I'm coming to see,

1034
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,120
hear those,
uh,

1035
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,850
those drug stories where a guy gets 
fucked up for like a year.

1036
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,920
Those securities shit out of me.
It happened.

1037
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,813
Mark man was telling us about that.
Like he did coke with Sam Kennison for 

1038
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:57,714
like a couple of days.
I didn't sleep and he was fucked up for 

1039
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:01,280
a year,
a whole year.

1040
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:04,440
He heard voices.
I would trade being fucked up for a year

1041
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:05,650
to do coke with Sam kinison.

1042
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,060
No,
but if it was like it was like 18 months

1043
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,170
in my life and like,
Yo,

1044
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:14,820
how do you tell your Italian mother 
that?

1045
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:15,680
No,
you can't.

1046
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,760
You can't keep your mouth shut.
What you.

1047
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,740
When you come from that culture man,
like my family,

1048
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,350
like old school Italians,
they don't believe in mental.

1049
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,773
You have to see it.
They believe in cancer because they see 

1050
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:27,900
it destroy your body.
If you say,

1051
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:29,310
I'm bipolar,
I'm depressed.

1052
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,040
You know what I'm saying?
I'm diagnosed depressed,

1053
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,240
undiagnosed,
epd.

1054
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:34,074
I take medication for it.
If that still isn't enough for these 

1055
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:40,620
people that it's the shake it off.
You know what I mean?

1056
00:46:40,621 --> 00:46:42,750
I can.
If my father was alive,

1057
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:43,584
he probably throw me up.
This flight of stairs for the immigrant 

1058
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:52,461
mentality and immigrant mentality is 
real and I'm going to steal that because

1059
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,490
they want no,
fuck it again.

1060
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,280
If it's not tangible,
they don't believe in it.

1061
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,380
If I broke my leg,
that woman would do everything for me.

1062
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:07,770
If I'm in the middle of a fucking 
breakdown,

1063
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,780
she's like,
you want gravy and balls?

1064
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,673
I'm like,
mom,

1065
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,010
I'm losing my shit.
I need to be hospitalized.

1066
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:18,330
Can Process and the best woman that I 
love,

1067
00:47:18,331 --> 00:47:22,290
no one in the world,
more than my mother and she's no one has

1068
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:24,310
been more supportive of me.
Um,

1069
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:25,323
and that's rad too with the immigrant 
mentality you think I'd get to get a 

1070
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:29,064
job,
go to.

1071
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,050
And she was like,
baby you do you like,

1072
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:35,170
if that's what you want,
that's amazing,

1073
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,010
do it,
but you better do it right?

1074
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,163
Don't do it half fast and don't bullshit
this drinking forty's and smoking 

1075
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:43,900
blondes.
Rap Shit.

1076
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:46,150
Looks good in the video.
But you gotta work,

1077
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,320
you know what I mean?

1078
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,280
And,
and it's um,

1079
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,540
the work ethic,
you know,

1080
00:47:51,541 --> 00:47:53,230
like Joey said,
the immigrant mentality,

1081
00:47:53,231 --> 00:47:55,420
but it helps you in other places because
when you,

1082
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:59,200
when you have relatives that didn't have
shit and you know,

1083
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,950
they're dressed in potato sacks as you 
go,

1084
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:05,170
Yo,
I can't let my father down.

1085
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:10,171
He's not with us anymore,
but I can't let him down because um,

1086
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:14,800
I carry his name.
I don't want to embarrass him.

1087
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,380
I don't want to embarrass my mother.
I want her to be proud,

1088
00:48:17,381 --> 00:48:18,200
you know?
And,

1089
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:22,360
and that drives everything man.
Like,

1090
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:23,194
yeah,
I'm getting choked up talking about it 

1091
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:27,430
because it's like I do everything for 
her,

1092
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,770
my son,
and when you're driven by that,

1093
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:33,280
it doesn't have to be a mama.
You're driven by something that you care

1094
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:35,320
about.
It changes everything,

1095
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:36,154
man.
That we have people in our industries 

1096
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:42,970
and entertainment industry that just 
have this fucking sense of entitlement.

1097
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,910
It's plagued.
I know,

1098
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:49,720
you know comics with fucking sense of on
when they're rude.

1099
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,300
When you go backstage.
I,

1100
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,980
I know from how you are that you shake 
everyone's hand.

1101
00:48:54,981 --> 00:48:56,830
Say how you doing?
Thank you.

1102
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,570
When they bring you something,
please.

1103
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,700
Thank you.
Yo.

1104
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,600
People don't do that man.
I know.

1105
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,550
You know what drives me crazy when they 
don't do that.

1106
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:04,384
A waiters,
waiters and waitresses it don't say 

1107
00:49:06,551 --> 00:49:08,500
thank you and they don't tip or they 
don't tip.

1108
00:49:08,501 --> 00:49:11,830
Well.
Last night the bill was a

1109
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,960
30 in the bar and I gave them 2:30
and the guy like chased me into stop.

1110
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,060
You made a mistake.
He did.

1111
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:20,840
He said,
did you?

1112
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,351
He was like,
Yo,

1113
00:49:21,351 --> 00:49:21,671
Yo,
Yo,

1114
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:22,030
Yo,
yo.

1115
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,863
Did you mean to do this?
You took care of me on that man and I 

1116
00:49:25,341 --> 00:49:29,600
know that people are shitting on you and
leaving a dollar or maybe not even that.

1117
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,310
Same with waitresses,
man.

1118
00:49:31,311 --> 00:49:33,440
No one gets shit on one of them.
What are they going to like?

1119
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:36,020
$2 an hour or something.
You know when you really appreciate them

1120
00:49:36,021 --> 00:49:37,710
when you go overseas and they don't get 
tipped.

1121
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,573
Yeah,
so those people barely pay attention to 

1122
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:43,040
those motherfuckers don't care.
You'll sit in Amsterdam,

1123
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:45,290
they won't even come over to give you a 
soda for an hour.

1124
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,273
And in Italy we were eating at Nice 
restaurants and the service was 

1125
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:50,960
terrible,
awful,

1126
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,033
awful.

1127
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,640
Because they don't give a fuck what?
Exact same amount.

1128
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:59,150
Why would they act any different than 
someone at Burger King?

1129
00:49:59,151 --> 00:50:00,650
You know what the lady said to me at the
restaurant,

1130
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:02,590
she goes to this,
we don't include a tip,

1131
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,640
but if you want you can leave.
And I said,

1132
00:50:04,641 --> 00:50:06,750
listen baby,
I'm going to leave you want care of us.

1133
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,820
So we had like a little American 
exchange then don't worry about it baby.

1134
00:50:10,821 --> 00:50:12,410
I got you.
If you set it up,

1135
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,230
if there's a preamble,
then it works,

1136
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,660
but sometimes you to do like when 
they're sitting you down and say,

1137
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:18,620
listen,
I'm from America,

1138
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:22,120
we tip the tip.
I tip big.

1139
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:22,940
Right?
Okay,

1140
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,430
let's make this wonderful.
You're setting the Rogan precedent.

1141
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:27,940
I'm taking care of you still take care 
of us.

1142
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:29,120
Yeah man.
But,

1143
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:29,954
but,
but that,

1144
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,590
it's just,
you know,

1145
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:33,680
when a kid brings in a case of water,
I'm like,

1146
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:34,610
hey man,
thank you.

1147
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,980
I've had those kids say to me,
Yo,

1148
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,550
I've been doing this 15 years.
No one's ever addressed me.

1149
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,170
And I'm like,
uh,

1150
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,530
that's awful.
A and M,

1151
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,230
I'm sorry for that,
but it's not going to be from me,

1152
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,120
but kid that brings the towels for the 
stage.

1153
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,080
Hey,
thank you.

1154
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,330
Thank you so much for having us.
I appreciate you.

1155
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:55,130
I hope we did good.
I hope,

1156
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,993
uh,
I hope the bar did well because my fans 

1157
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:59,310
are degenerates.
I hope.

1158
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,000
I hope it went well.
And I think,

1159
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:04,260
um,
I think that goes a long way bro,

1160
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:05,510
in life.
You know,

1161
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:07,280
I don't want to get into like a Karma 
discussion,

1162
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:11,030
but I think whether it's a comic or wrap
up a metal band,

1163
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:14,060
if you treat people like shit for a long
time,

1164
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:15,190
that gets around Bro.

1165
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:20,660
CORECON comic promoters know each other.
Music promoters know each other.

1166
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:22,340
They'll fucking call and be like,
Yo,

1167
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:24,800
this guy's a fucking dick face.
I get those stories.

1168
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:25,653
You know,
like I was talking to a promoter the 

1169
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,310
other day and he was telling me about 
some guy who was an asshole.

1170
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:30,183
It's like yelling at the sound guy at 
the sound check and yelling at the 

1171
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:34,304
promoter.
Made them fly to New York to for some 

1172
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:37,274
thing because the sound wasn't right or 
he wasn't happy with something and you 

1173
00:51:40,851 --> 00:51:42,290
know,
they have to accommodate this guy,

1174
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,133
but they're,
they're shaking their head and then 

1175
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:46,280
every chance they get they're going to 
tell everybody else.

1176
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,800
Of course when Madonna he is and I 
don't,

1177
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,100
and if he's popular right now,
when he starts to wane,

1178
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,790
those motherfuckers will remember that 
now when dudes like me and you,

1179
00:51:55,850 --> 00:52:00,830
if we start to wane will still get love 
because of the way we treated people and

1180
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:01,850
that's reciprocated.

1181
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,510
Like Yo,
maybe he did 5,000

1182
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:06,344
people last time.
This time it was just talking 20 years 

1183
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:10,940
down the line or something and then you 
only do half.

1184
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:13,670
That's still going to have you because 
of the way you behave,

1185
00:52:13,671 --> 00:52:14,990
the way you were raised.
Well,

1186
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:18,410
it's also you got an opportunity when 
you're interacting with people,

1187
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:21,260
like if you're working with someone and 
you guys are doing something together,

1188
00:52:21,261 --> 00:52:25,180
you've got an opportunity to just put 
smiles on faces and they.

1189
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,710
They put smiles on other people's faces 
because of that.

1190
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:28,544
Everybody's smiling.
Then you've got a nice trickle down 

1191
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:32,700
effect once community what?
It's.

1192
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,793
It takes more energy to be an asshole.
It does for me because I can be an 

1193
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:40,940
asshole and when I am I feel drained.
It drains the shit out of me.

1194
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,220
I don't feel good about it.
I just have a Tampon,

1195
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:47,270
but wop temper,
but I try to curb it and I realized when

1196
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,620
I treat people the way that they deserve
to be treated,

1197
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,880
everything changes.

1198
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,060
The energy in the room changes.
They might bring you.

1199
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:59,070
I don't know if you drink or smoke 
before you perform both.

1200
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,913
Both.
Okay.

1201
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,823
So if you,
if on your rider is two bottles of grey 

1202
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,550
goose,
you might look over.

1203
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:06,980
There might be four just because you are
a sweetheart.

1204
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,410
Not because you asked for it,
it just,

1205
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:10,483
it's just little shit.
I'm not even saying it's a big deal and 

1206
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:13,013
it's life changing.
There's just little shit that people 

1207
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:17,690
will,
uh,

1208
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,490
you know,
it'll,

1209
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,383
it makes their day just by us being 
polite instead of the guy that they had 

1210
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:28,350
the last night there was a ball breaker 
and saying the sound man.

1211
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,770
The first off,
the guy that don't,

1212
00:53:30,771 --> 00:53:35,430
you don't have a fuck with a sound man,
is that mother fucker will get you that.

1213
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:38,010
Motherfucker's got a ponytail.
He fucking listening.

1214
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:39,900
He smokes weed to the allman brothers.

1215
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,560
He's been around the block and people 
don't realize that shit.

1216
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:47,460
That motherfucker is 60.
He fucking listen to the MC five.

1217
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,720
He fucking did sound for everybody.
You and I probably worship.

1218
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,880
He is not impressed.
He's probably pressed by you.

1219
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:57,750
It's definitely not impressed by me.
A rapper from philly.

1220
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:58,584
He don't give a fuck.
You don't want to be doing mike sound 

1221
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,913
right.
So the last thing I need to do is be 

1222
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:03,080
like,
Yo Schmo Hawk,

1223
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,400
turn this shop.
You know,

1224
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:10,450
it's mentality with a lot of people 
adopt that when they become successful,

1225
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,390
they want to be a prick.
They want,

1226
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:16,283
they want to let everybody know they 
want to be that guy who yells and rex 

1227
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:21,500
hotel rooms and you know,
that kind of shit.

1228
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,110
Oh I do,
but,

1229
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,860
but I can't.
I don't understand it.

1230
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,073
You know,
I understand that due to weakness and 

1231
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:32,910
it's just they waited for so long to 
make it.

1232
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,280
Now they finally make it.
They want everybody to suck their Dick.

1233
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,330
But do you think that things like that 
can be controlled by upbringing?

1234
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,560
Yeah,
they can be,

1235
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:41,420
but it's my,
my,

1236
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,690
I have.
All right,

1237
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:44,610
so I'm ready to smash something in a 
hotel.

1238
00:54:44,611 --> 00:54:45,444
I hear my mom to that.
To those that made is going to have to 

1239
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:51,990
spend all the.
You know what I mean?

1240
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,113
She tells me when I'm cranky about a 
show and I'm leaving for tour and 

1241
00:54:56,011 --> 00:54:58,890
there's no sleep,
so you talked to everyone of those kids.

1242
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,980
You sign every autograph and you take 
every picture.

1243
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:03,810
I'm going upside your head with a wooden
spoon.

1244
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,473
Spoon still has the crack from my head 
from back then and it's still the one 

1245
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:10,470
she starts the gravy with,
but it's so cracked.

1246
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,600
But she said,
she said,

1247
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,434
you are here for a reason and these 
people look up to you and these people 

1248
00:55:16,531 --> 00:55:21,531
respect you and you do your best to not 
just continue that,

1249
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,063
but to have them think you're a better 
person than they already do because 

1250
00:55:29,161 --> 00:55:32,130
that's going to trickle down and then 
maybe they'll treat people better.

1251
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,920
You said it.
All of this,

1252
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,780
all this energy travels,
man.

1253
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,950
It does.
You know,

1254
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:38,784
if someone was in here right now,
just for all three of us will get 

1255
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,200
miserable real quick.
If someone was in here,

1256
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:45,180
bitch,
everyone's out to get me.

1257
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,820
You know everyone that's in the s,
everyone's fault,

1258
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:50,310
man.
Except that type of motherfucker.

1259
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,520
It's never there for every fucking 
decision they made a self inflicted,

1260
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,520
but they can't self examine and say,
maybe it's me.

1261
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,440
How about just give me a maybe 
motherfucker.

1262
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,440
Some of these people I know that's not 
even in their head.

1263
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:06,510
It's all of us.
It's you,

1264
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,310
it's me.
You didn't give him a break.

1265
00:56:08,311 --> 00:56:10,530
You didn't let them on this show.
Motherfucker.

1266
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:11,364
Maybe it's you.
Maybe your energy is also our 

1267
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:16,230
responsibility to castle's people aside.
Agreed.

1268
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,810
There's a lesson.
Agreed and that's what tribes would do,

1269
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,810
but when you're talking about a lesson,
I think when you're too deep into it,

1270
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,980
you're not learning.
I think when you hit a certain

1271
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,470
age and you're still like that,
I think you're done.

1272
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:28,060
Some people,
I just think you're done.

1273
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:30,760
I know that's a negative way and we're 
talking about not being negative,

1274
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:31,594
but sometimes just reality's reality 
being pragmatic and you want to talk 

1275
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,970
about like good use of your time.
Yeah.

1276
00:56:36,971 --> 00:56:41,430
You're not going to fix a 45 year old 
guy complains every day and that's about

1277
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,050
a 25 year old kid might be going through
some shit.

1278
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,920
It could be a breakup,
a loss of a parent,

1279
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:47,763
that pattern that they're in this 
pattern and you have to break patterns 

1280
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:54,200
and if you don't break them,
you end up being that 45 year old.

1281
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,590
I was a shitty friend to people.
Man,

1282
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:57,424
I'm,
I've always been loved and like in my 

1283
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:00,910
twenties and shit,
I was just selfish,

1284
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,133
like nothing crazy.
I never did anything like horrible to 

1285
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:04,534
someone but just I thought about myself 
first and I was probably like not maybe 

1286
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:09,694
the best friend is some of these people 
and they're still in my life and I had 

1287
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:16,240
to make a conscious effort to,
to,

1288
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:19,150
to evolve,
to evolve and break patterns,

1289
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:20,200
man and breaking patterns.

1290
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,210
It's hard as fuck.
It's hard as fuck.

1291
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:24,490
But that's part of growth,
you know?

1292
00:57:24,491 --> 00:57:25,324
And that's one of the reasons why it's 
important to be around people that are 

1293
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:30,250
also doing the same kind of thing you 
feed off of.

1294
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,460
Yes,
yes.

1295
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,430
And when you're around people that are 
just real negative,

1296
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:36,550
that feeds off of it to be negative as 
well.

1297
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,050
Yeah.
And,

1298
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:37,883
and you don't feel the need to break 
that cycle because you're around 

1299
00:57:41,351 --> 00:57:43,120
motherfuckers that are thinking like 
that too.

1300
00:57:43,121 --> 00:57:46,020
So it becomes this,
this pity party where you're all,

1301
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,030
it's a circle jerk of misery,
you know what I'm saying?

1302
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:51,340
And the,
and the circle jerk of misery.

1303
00:57:51,341 --> 00:57:53,420
It's just,
it's never ending there.

1304
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,393
So anything that.
One of the things that really expands 

1305
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:56,734
your understanding of people and life is
just being in a bunch of different 

1306
00:58:00,491 --> 00:58:02,680
places and understanding that where you 
grew up,

1307
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:04,600
it's just one part of the world.

1308
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:06,820
Yes.
The world is this massive play.

1309
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:09,700
Like I just got back from Thailand.
I was in Thailand the summer.

1310
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,550
I'd never been around so many friendly 
people.

1311
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:13,863
Friendly,
nice smiling people that I think they 

1312
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:18,750
call it the land of the smile or land of
a thousand smiles or some shit.

1313
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,743
That's beautiful.
But that's what it's like when you're 

1314
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:21,664
over there.
People are just so friendly and I was 

1315
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:23,711
like,
wow,

1316
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:25,240
okay.
If you grew up here,

1317
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:30,130
something about whatever momentum these 
people have developed in their culture.

1318
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,440
Their culture is like smiling and 
friendly to each other.

1319
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,390
This is a,
this is just the,

1320
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,010
the vibe,
the way they do it,

1321
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,150
but if you around some real,
I grow super shitty,

1322
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,550
insulting,
aggressive culture,

1323
00:58:42,551 --> 00:58:45,070
then that would be what you had to adapt
to grow.

1324
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,940
Philly was voted the most hostile city 
in America by Time magazine.

1325
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:49,990
Oh,
it's up there.

1326
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:54,990
So I.
I always though recently what I said,

1327
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,283
this is how I described it.
He said the very smart people who will 

1328
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:01,630
punch you.
Yeah.

1329
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,140
Like it's a good description of Matt.
That's not a very smart,

1330
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:09,850
very smart media of average intelligence
that will punch you.

1331
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,060
But it's Philly's a sophisticated city.
It's a real city,

1332
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:15,980
but they're all,
they're hard people owns man.

1333
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:17,830
They're hard people that.
Look,

1334
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,620
man,
we threw snowballs at Santa Claus.

1335
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,330
Michael Irvin broke his leg and we 
cheered.

1336
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:24,693
Well,
the famous bill burr rant when they 

1337
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:30,830
booed and this girl went on towards your
Philly for 10 minutes.

1338
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:31,730
Yes.
Yes.

1339
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:32,683
And I love dom and dom.
He did the same restaurant working with 

1340
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:37,100
dom tonight.
Are you the Ice House?

1341
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:40,610
Yeah,
he's Dom's great man.

1342
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,160
The best we eat at a place called 
poppies and south Philly.

1343
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:44,640
And I see them all the time.
He's a sweetheart,

1344
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:45,483
sweetheart guy.

1345
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:46,430
Great Guy,
man.

1346
00:59:46,431 --> 00:59:47,470
Legend.
Yeah.

1347
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,430
Um,
I just saw him on the,

1348
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:50,264
uh,
the Bruce Willis roasting murdered on 

1349
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:54,480
that murder.
But he's a great guy.

1350
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,970
Uh,
but,

1351
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:59,390
um,
I've been friends with Don for 25 years.

1352
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:00,730
Have you?
Wow.

1353
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,760
You know,
he's a Philly Guy,

1354
01:00:01,761 --> 01:00:02,390
right?
Oh yeah,

1355
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,991
yeah,
yeah.

1356
01:00:02,991 --> 01:00:04,360
Okay.
Um,

1357
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,550
but yeah,
w w what you like.

1358
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:11,480
There's also a level a guilt though in 
cutting some of these people off the you

1359
01:00:11,481 --> 01:00:14,290
were talking about.
That's Kinda hard for me because like,

1360
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,190
loyalty's a big thing too when you're 
talking about all these,

1361
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:19,780
tell them these things,
but they don't listen to.

1362
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,010
Then you got to tell them again.
Then they don't listen.

1363
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:23,420
Then you got to cut them off and he 
goes,

1364
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:25,400
look,
I told you that's what's happening now.

1365
01:00:25,401 --> 01:00:27,200
But I still,
it eats at me.

1366
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:31,160
I feel bad.
Like I should be like a savior complex.

1367
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,660
You know what I'm saying?

1368
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:37,280
I know that I don't want anyone to be 
fucked up man.

1369
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,090
And I have a hard time being like,
Yo,

1370
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:43,640
this person is detrimental.
And they,

1371
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:45,943
there,
my energy is fucked up with them being 

1372
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,300
in my life,
but when it's time to cut them off,

1373
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:51,134
I still feel like,
am I being a shitty person by doing 

1374
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:53,660
that?
Yeah.

1375
01:00:53,661 --> 01:00:54,494
Well that's what they want you to think 
because they don't take care of 

1376
01:00:56,001 --> 01:00:56,930
themselves.
Right?

1377
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,880
But you got to take care of yourself 
before I take care of you.

1378
01:00:58,881 --> 01:00:59,714
I mean,
you got to at least want to help you if 

1379
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:01,904
you want to.
But if you're not taking care of 

1380
01:01:03,141 --> 01:01:04,500
yourself,
you want me to do it for you?

1381
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,270
Hey,
hey.

1382
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,103
Hey.
You gotta get your own shit together 

1383
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:08,830
first.
Yeah.

1384
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:09,743
At least make an attempt.
You can't just ask everybody to carry 

1385
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:13,730
your bags like,
come on.

1386
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,000
They want you to carry their emotional 
bags all the time.

1387
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:17,990
And,
and again,

1388
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:19,670
like I said,
if there's no,

1389
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,340
there's no introspection,
there is no,

1390
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,240
well maybe this many years and all of 
this should happen to me.

1391
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,930
Maybe it's me and I'm a dead when you 
can't see that.

1392
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,150
I feel like,
I don't know man.

1393
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:36,530
I call them people lost causes.
It seems very dark and grim,

1394
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:38,120
but I think they exist.
Well,

1395
01:01:38,121 --> 01:01:38,954
I think you probably have this attitude 
because your dad died when you were 

1396
01:01:41,151 --> 01:01:42,770
young and you were left alone.
Yeah.

1397
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:43,623
You know,
and I have a lot of that because my 

1398
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,284
father and my mother split up and I was 
real young and I haven't seen my dad 

1399
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:49,574
since I was seven,
so it's sort of thing you'd be feeling 

1400
01:01:51,731 --> 01:01:54,410
abandoned.
I don't want to leave anybody behind.

1401
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:55,244
So I always rescued stray dogs and feral
cats and took his crazy friends and 

1402
01:01:59,830 --> 01:02:00,590
this.

1403
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:01,423
My whole life has been like that you 
making in the misfits and your father 

1404
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:07,070
made that decision and that weighs on 
you.

1405
01:02:07,071 --> 01:02:09,660
And my father made the decision to die.
He had three.

1406
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,220
He had bypass surgeries.
They told them to stop smoking,

1407
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,920
stop doing this,
stop doing that.

1408
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:21,000
He had my older brother cigarettes to 
the hospital.

1409
01:02:21,001 --> 01:02:24,560
He drug the ivy down to the bathroom and
was smoking out of the window.

1410
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,930
He,
he had a young son and made a choice not

1411
01:02:27,931 --> 01:02:28,764
to live for.
My other brothers are 11 and 12 years 

1412
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:34,230
older,
so they got them for 21 and 22.

1413
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,051
You know what I mean?
Like it bro.

1414
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,680
I can't remember his voice.
You know what I mean?

1415
01:02:37,681 --> 01:02:40,530
And that shit was heavy because you,
it's like,

1416
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:42,870
did he not love me enough to live for 
me?

1417
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:44,063
You know?
And those things manifest themselves in 

1418
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,350
different ways.

1419
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:48,300
As you get older you don't even know 
you're not.

1420
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:49,183
You know what's crazy?
It's a gift in some ways and the gift 

1421
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,570
and the curse,
the gift is that you,

1422
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:55,643
you have this energy that comes from 
this lack of this lack of something in 

1423
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:00,750
your life.
You're young.

1424
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,830
Yeah.
You know,

1425
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:02,664
I mean,
this is something I struggled with with 

1426
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:05,550
my kids because I try to keep my kids 
everything.

1427
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,100
Always give them love.
Always your hug,

1428
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:08,934
kiss all the time,
make sure they know we were talking 

1429
01:03:10,321 --> 01:03:13,080
about this answer.
All my friends that are interesting came

1430
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:13,914
from fucked up childhoods.
All my favorite friends are my favorite 

1431
01:03:17,191 --> 01:03:18,024
friends.
Their life was chaos when they were 

1432
01:03:18,811 --> 01:03:21,540
growing up and they became these really 
interesting people.

1433
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:22,710
I,
I hate that.

1434
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:27,390
That's what created us,
but you couldn't be more right.

1435
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:28,253
I mean,
you're talking about your favorite 

1436
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:30,560
friends that are.
I mean,

1437
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:31,890
my favorite.
Everything,

1438
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,940
everything.
Artists,

1439
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,690
painters,
musicians,

1440
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,780
rock bands,
punk,

1441
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:36,623
metal,
have,

1442
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,613
all of them were fucked in the,
I don't know any well balanced people 

1443
01:03:39,811 --> 01:03:41,250
that are,
that I feel like,

1444
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,810
oh,
that guy's a brilliant mind.

1445
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,840
He came from a two parent home in the 
suburbs of Connecticut.

1446
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:48,300
I don't know anyone like that.
Pressure creates diamonds.

1447
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:49,134
Yeah,
man.

1448
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:50,700
Bust pipes too.
It does.

1449
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:51,683
Bus.

1450
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,650
Yeah.
But uh,

1451
01:03:54,650 --> 01:03:55,610
but,
you know,

1452
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:59,520
I wonder like how much of that stuff 
haunts me and create,

1453
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:00,383
you know,
like,

1454
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,280
you know,
your parents splitting and being seven,

1455
01:04:03,281 --> 01:04:04,114
like how many of the fucked up things 
that go on in your head now relate back 

1456
01:04:07,591 --> 01:04:10,500
to that and you're not even aware 
because the mind is so complicated.

1457
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:12,260
Oh yeah.
You know,

1458
01:04:12,270 --> 01:04:14,190
when I started realizing that when I was
smoking weed,

1459
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,940
I didn't really start smoking weed 
seriously until I was 30.

1460
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:19,183
And then when I started doing it and 
then I started thinking about all sorts 

1461
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:24,270
of different patterns and while I was 
angry all the time,

1462
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:27,840
and I think a lot of it came from this 
resentment of being abandoned when I was

1463
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:28,674
young.
Some of your early stuff was fucking 

1464
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,570
super dark.
I mean,

1465
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:34,440
I love,
I think you're a brilliant comic,

1466
01:04:34,441 --> 01:04:37,470
so I love all these ideas,
but some of that earlier stuff,

1467
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:38,304
man,
that's pretty fucking and angry dark 

1468
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:40,440
place.

1469
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,550
It was also,
I was,

1470
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:42,384
uh,
that was also just a few years after I 

1471
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:47,400
was done fighting like I was a different
person.

1472
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:50,270
I just had a different mindset.
And Yah,

1473
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:55,610
that's a very strange transition between
competition and then stand up comedy.

1474
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,213
It's just a very different kind of 
mindset of I carried a little bit too 

1475
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:03,550
much combat with when you were still 
fighting it.

1476
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:04,384
We're still fighting.
And sometimes when you don't know what 

1477
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,060
you're fighting,
it's worse.

1478
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:11,760
It's worse.
You start internalizing it and you don't

1479
01:05:11,761 --> 01:05:12,594
know what the war.
It's war with itself and the war would 

1480
01:05:14,821 --> 01:05:19,440
self because you don't,
you wanted this needs this,

1481
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,333
this energy needs to be channeled and 
how can it be and you and you went back 

1482
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:27,280
shit on the knife and went really dark 
with it and I've done that too.

1483
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,980
But for us to be healthy.
His.

1484
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:31,900
The other question though,
if we were to get healthy,

1485
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:32,040
what?

1486
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,460
We just suck.
Yeah.

1487
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:35,230
Well I used to worry about that when I 
was young.

1488
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:40,060
I used to worry about being.
My idea was that if I became somehow,

1489
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:41,560
you know,
air quote enlightened,

1490
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:43,030
right?
Because I wouldn't be funny anymore.

1491
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,770
Right?
Because all the funny people I knew were

1492
01:05:44,771 --> 01:05:46,490
fucked.
Of course I don't want that.

1493
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,740
I needed to be a drug addict.
I'm like,

1494
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,603
damn,
Kennedy was a drug addict prior with a 

1495
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:52,870
drug addict.
Maybe I need to look at these people.

1496
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,610
I mean historically you look at Hendrix,
look at,

1497
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,100
you know what I mean?
Look at look at Bacara.

1498
01:05:58,380 --> 01:05:59,730
Janis Joplin.
Yes.

1499
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:05,350
Because he's a fucking mess.
The town drunk and one of the best.

1500
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,630
So I thought and think the same way.
I'm like,

1501
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:10,390
I might need to pick up a habit.
Just drink.

1502
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,010
Yeah,
I shouldn't.

1503
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,580
I drank a lot and had an epiphany.

1504
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:19,650
I woke up one day and cold Turkey.
That really?

1505
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:20,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1506
01:06:20,891 --> 01:06:21,724
I drank a lot for a lot of years.
And now you don't drink it or it's just 

1507
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:27,820
like cash a little bit,
little bit,

1508
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,020
little bit,
little bit.

1509
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:30,650
But uh,
it's,

1510
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:32,830
it's,
it's more like when I perform.

1511
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,090
Right.
You know what I mean?

1512
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,983
Just loosen up yet.
But I was drinking two bottles of grey 

1513
01:06:36,700 --> 01:06:39,640
goose alone every night.
Oh yeah.

1514
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:41,560
Alone though.
Every night.

1515
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,220
Seven days a week.
That's a lot.

1516
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,780
Two bottles to the head.
That's a Bert Kreischer love burt.

1517
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:47,723
Love with the bird.
I know that he's got a bottle in his 

1518
01:06:50,501 --> 01:06:54,730
head when he's listening to this.
Who Love the bird.

1519
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:55,593
Yeah.
Yeah.

1520
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,760
You guys are close.
Yeah,

1521
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:57,101
yeah,
yeah,

1522
01:06:57,101 --> 01:06:58,690
yeah.
We're doing sober October.

1523
01:06:58,870 --> 01:07:00,830
We're trying to figure out the bet.
Well,

1524
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:02,230
who grants first?
Yeah,

1525
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:03,520
well,
we're trying to figure out what to do.

1526
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,290
Thompson [inaudible] got some great 
idea.

1527
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:06,133
Instead of a yoga classes,
there's some application that you will 

1528
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,600
find out.
Are you in on this bed?

1529
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,640
I want money on this is going to crack a
joke.

1530
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,350
You.
You're not gonna be able to do the pot?

1531
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,683
No.
I took the last sober October off the 

1532
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:22,251
whole month.
Yeah,

1533
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,650
I took the whole month off.
No Pot.

1534
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:24,580
No,
no pot.

1535
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,800
You don't believe me.
You out there.

1536
01:07:26,010 --> 01:07:29,230
You're looking at me looking at you 
crazy.

1537
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,570
I'm going to find the order here.
Joseph.

1538
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,480
I don't believe that you were sneaking 
the pot.

1539
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,750
No,
it wasn't leaving either.

1540
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:38,703
Already wanted to get me tested.
We went to a yoga class or put money on 

1541
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:42,851
it.
If I put money,

1542
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:43,870
I'm getting blood work.
He's like,

1543
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,850
we're going to go to the.
Took a drug test.

1544
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:48,510
He said he's still going to do mushrooms
when he's like camping or some shelves.

1545
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:51,310
That's okay.
I'll let that slide.

1546
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,880
So this is what the fuck this thing is.
It is a um,

1547
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,310
it's some sort of a heart rate 
application.

1548
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:59,020
What is it called?
My zone.

1549
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:00,880
Some.
My zone.

1550
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:01,743
It's a,
you're aware this thing around your 

1551
01:08:02,591 --> 01:08:03,424
chest and it registers on an app and it 
gives you points for the amount of work 

1552
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:08,854
you do.
He and Tom suggested that we try to 

1553
01:08:12,491 --> 01:08:15,740
achieve some ridiculous amount of points
for the month.

1554
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,740
I was like 40,000
points or some shit.

1555
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,210
This is it.
You got it.

1556
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:23,060
Um,
I forget what the number that Tom said,

1557
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:23,953
but we're going to have to agree on this
number and what it would basically 

1558
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:28,124
means.
You've got to work out almost an hour 

1559
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:34,970
and a half every single fucking day of 
the month or no off days,

1560
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,880
no off days or you're in good shape.
You can do that.

1561
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:38,750
Yeah,
I'll,

1562
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,920
uh,
I'll be all right.

1563
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:42,020
I'll figure it out.
Different Shit to do.

1564
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,600
So I'll run hills.
I'll kick box.

1565
01:08:44,601 --> 01:08:45,434
I'll do little Jujitsu on it.
You guys can bet on how long before I 

1566
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:50,571
die.
Well,

1567
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:51,550
you work out,
right?

1568
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,760
I know you do a little boxing.
Well,

1569
01:08:52,761 --> 01:08:56,480
here's the thing I did wasn't in good 
shape as a kid.

1570
01:08:56,540 --> 01:09:00,440
Then when I got wrapped money,
I did the dumb thing and turn into a fat

1571
01:09:00,441 --> 01:09:01,970
pig.
You know,

1572
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,520
so late past maybe years,
I,

1573
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:05,540
you know,
a couple of years,

1574
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:08,360
maybe 18 months.
I'm back boxing again.

1575
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:13,070
So you just regular hitting the bag,
hitting the back cardio,

1576
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,520
skipping rope.
I know you're a giant boxing fan.

1577
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,080
Yeah,
like obsessive.

1578
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:18,973
Yeah,
me too.

1579
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,813
Yeah,
I know you are.

1580
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:20,953
Yeah.
You are.

1581
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:21,760
Yeah.
Uh,

1582
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,593
I liked your posts on Canelo Alvarez 
triple g to casual boxy fails or the 

1583
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:28,260
worst.
I mean I don't,

1584
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:29,980
it's like,
it's,

1585
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:33,050
it's really like child molesters,
like under,

1586
01:09:33,051 --> 01:09:33,800
like the other one.

1587
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,310
The other word like pedophiles are the 
worst and then casual boxing fans.

1588
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,203
Yeah.
It's the same with them and make sure 

1589
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,770
those kids hate me.
They just yell at me that I should watch

1590
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,550
what I post.
Something about boxing,

1591
01:09:45,570 --> 01:09:46,890
watch mma,
faggot.

1592
01:09:46,891 --> 01:09:49,490
And I'm like,
oh man.

1593
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,380
Yeah.
And all aggro towards me.

1594
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,463
Yeah.
Well how come you could be a soccer fan 

1595
01:09:56,691 --> 01:09:58,190
but you can't be a boxing fan?
Yeah.

1596
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,160
I don't know man.
How come you can be a basketball fan?

1597
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:04,880
Can't be a box.
The hostility is there,

1598
01:10:04,881 --> 01:10:05,700
man.
Well the,

1599
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:10,460
the stupid conflict between MMA and 
boxing,

1600
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:11,590
I think it's stupid.
It's,

1601
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,730
it's,
it's a deal to a lot of people,

1602
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:14,653
you know what I mean?
It's so stupid because so many MMA 

1603
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:18,730
fighters have learned from boxer.
Absolutely.

1604
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:20,271
Seniors.
Sure.

1605
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:20,811
Yeah.
Max,

1606
01:10:20,811 --> 01:10:22,880
a friend of mine and he's a,
he's a big,

1607
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,760
huge box and we would train a wild card.

1608
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:26,623
He's one of the rare Mac Dan's.
He goes one of the rare vegans that 

1609
01:10:29,361 --> 01:10:32,150
competed successfully for a long period 
of time.

1610
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:33,950
One of the rare ones.
Yeah,

1611
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,560
he's a smart guy.
Very,

1612
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:36,800
very bright,
but yeah,

1613
01:10:36,801 --> 01:10:37,634
I really watched his diet correctly and 
made sure they got the proper foods and 

1614
01:10:41,841 --> 01:10:44,010
fatty acids and different things.
Yeah,

1615
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:45,590
I couldn't do it.
Yeah.

1616
01:10:45,591 --> 01:10:47,160
Well,
I mean for him it was a,

1617
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,043
in his mind it was an ethical choice.
I know there's a lot of other ones that 

1618
01:10:50,931 --> 01:10:53,540
are vegetarians and do really well.
Like jake shields.

1619
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:58,541
He's a vegetarian,
but he eats eggs and milk and cheese and

1620
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:00,920
things along those lines.
But you want your own stuff.

1621
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:01,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1622
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,350
Do you enjoy that?
I do,

1623
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:04,430
yeah.
Yeah.

1624
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:05,960
Yeah.
But how did you,

1625
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:06,953
like,
how do you learn that process of what 

1626
01:11:09,681 --> 01:11:11,320
you do after the animal?
Like,

1627
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,313
yeah,
I got lucky that I learned from people 

1628
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:16,440
that know what they're doing,
but Steve Rinella,

1629
01:11:16,441 --> 01:11:20,010
who's a good friend of mine took me for 
the first time on a television show.

1630
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,110
So the first time I ever wanted was on 
tv,

1631
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,200
which is kind of nerve wracking.
Sure.

1632
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:27,270
You don't want to fuck up and wound an 
animal and television.

1633
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:28,710
Um,
but,

1634
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:34,250
but what it is to me,
it's like I saw so many videos,

1635
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:35,603
I saw so many of those factory farming 
videos and I don't want to be a part of 

1636
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:39,324
this too.
So I was either going to be a 

1637
01:11:40,231 --> 01:11:42,660
vegetarian,
which I tried to be when I was fighting.

1638
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,790
I was trying to stay at a lower weight 
class and I was a vegetarian for awhile.

1639
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:49,920
I felt like shit.
And then I probably was doing it wrong.

1640
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:51,990
If you're ready to scream at your 
keyboard right now,

1641
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:54,300
you know,
that's what they're doing right now.

1642
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,080
You can plant power,
plant based path.

1643
01:11:56,190 --> 01:11:58,800
You're going to get bombarded.
But,

1644
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,810
um,
when I started eating meat again,

1645
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:04,140
I went up a weight class and that's,
I became much better and I just,

1646
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:06,650
my body just reacts better with me too.

1647
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:07,360
Yeah.
Yeah,

1648
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,131
me too.
I like,

1649
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:09,690
I tried it too,
you know what I mean?

1650
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,420
Um,
I just found that,

1651
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:17,160
you know,
I'm making smart decisions.

1652
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:19,830
Forget Vegan and vegetarian or a meat 
diet,

1653
01:12:19,831 --> 01:12:22,430
just making smart decisions,
dietary,

1654
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:24,450
these dietary decisions,
you know what I mean?

1655
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,430
It was,
uh,

1656
01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:28,380
was the,
all the difference in the world for me.

1657
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:30,640
And as someone who works out as much as 
you do,

1658
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,190
you feel better.
You just do.

1659
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:33,450
Yeah.
It's not a lie.

1660
01:12:33,451 --> 01:12:35,100
It's not.
No one's lying to you about it.

1661
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,750
You just feel better when you work out.
Well,

1662
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:39,420
the thing about fighters and people that
are in competition though,

1663
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,254
it's like if there's more at stake,
because it's not just about feeling 

1664
01:12:42,781 --> 01:12:43,980
better,
it's like you have,

1665
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,053
you have an obligation to your brain,
to your body and to your future to 

1666
01:12:49,231 --> 01:12:52,260
perform at your best and your life.
Because that's not a game.

1667
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,930
You don't play mma.
You don't play box.

1668
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:55,823
Right.
It's true that you can die and people 

1669
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:01,920
have people that if you're cutting 
weight the wrong way,

1670
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,120
when,
you know what I mean,

1671
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,760
because there's tons of wrong ways to do
shit,

1672
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:07,680
you know,
we know that diuretics,

1673
01:13:07,681 --> 01:13:08,950
all of that,
you come in,

1674
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:10,333
you know,
malnourished and someone hits like a 

1675
01:13:11,791 --> 01:13:13,500
fucking mule man.
You know,

1676
01:13:13,501 --> 01:13:15,120
that's no joke.
No joke.

1677
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:17,100
I mean,
if anybody thinks he play boxing,

1678
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,730
watch Canelo Alvarez versus uh,
you know,

1679
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:21,983
anybody where he like watch a watch.
Any like real vicious knockout of 

1680
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:29,620
someone's.
When he took off,

1681
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,210
he took James Kirkland soul out of his 
body.

1682
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,500
How about Amir Khan?
Oh,

1683
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,280
when we cracked Amir Khan with that,
right?

1684
01:13:36,281 --> 01:13:37,350
Yeah.
Boom.

1685
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,213
I mean,
we go back to the eighties and Julian 

1686
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:41,840
Jackson,
we just separate people from the,

1687
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,390
from the,
from Jude.

1688
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:45,980
I'm Julian.
Jackson was a murderer.

1689
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,660
He's the hardest puncher I ever saw my 
light.

1690
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:51,980
Here's Khan right here.
And Canelo Alvarez right hand.

1691
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,660
See this is.
Oh good Lord.

1692
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,510
That was one of those fights.
Were they short circuited,

1693
01:13:57,511 --> 01:13:57,840
right?
Yeah.

1694
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,060
He doesn't know where he's at.
That's not a game right there.

1695
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:01,373
You're not playing that up,
but Canelo is so much bigger than him 

1696
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:04,890
too.
There's so much bigger.

1697
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:07,950
Yeah.
I mean he made 1:54,

1698
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:11,430
but he's a middle way and Amir Khan is a
blown up welter.

1699
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,423
Yeah,
but he just separated his soul from his 

1700
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,780
body right there.
Just fucking hammertime that.

1701
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,220
He's the.
One of the interesting things in.

1702
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:21,490
You put this on your instagram about the
first triple g fight.

1703
01:14:21,491 --> 01:14:24,810
He landed in a triple g and triple g 
shook it off and kept locking tourism.

1704
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:27,040
Yeah.
And you can see it in his eyes like,

1705
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,680
oh my goodness.
Caught them clean.

1706
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,120
I mean,
you're a fighter man.

1707
01:14:31,121 --> 01:14:33,250
You hit someone with your best shit and 
they don't budge.

1708
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:34,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

1709
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,010
Especially if you used to take people 
out.

1710
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:37,900
That's what I'm.
And everything shifts.

1711
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,033
Well,
that's where a guy like Paulie 

1712
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:42,490
Malignaggi has a slight advantage.
It.

1713
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:43,324
He's very rarely knocked anybody out.
So used to hitting people and keep them 

1714
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,130
going.
Yes.

1715
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:49,900
Yes.
He got once he had bad hands,

1716
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:52,030
so we had to change his style.
You know,

1717
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,790
it's a box and just poke the jab over 
and over and over.

1718
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:58,960
Throw a right hand every now and then to
keep them honest with bad hands,

1719
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:02,260
but the beautiful thing,
the Canelo did he,

1720
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:05,610
he just,
he just paused but the jab just to draw,

1721
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:07,650
just to draw him down and he came over 
at the time,

1722
01:15:07,651 --> 01:15:08,500
at the right hand,
but yeah.

1723
01:15:08,501 --> 01:15:09,400
Beautiful stuff,
man.

1724
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:11,110
Yeah,
that fight.

1725
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:15,280
I watched it again after a teddy atlas 
and I had a podcast.

1726
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:17,450
I watched a triple g canelo fight again.
They,

1727
01:15:17,451 --> 01:15:18,730
you score it?
Nope.

1728
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,863
No,
I didn't because what the kids were 

1729
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:22,480
running around.
So the eye test.

1730
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:24,400
What is your eye tests?
Fucking close.

1731
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:26,410
Fight.
Fucking close fight.

1732
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:31,710
Triple g came on real strong towards 
secondhand makes you want 15 round fight

1733
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,950
is what it means is.
It does,

1734
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,300
yes it does.
But again,

1735
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:36,130
dumb motherfuckers would have 
struggling.

1736
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:37,900
Yeah.
You know what those 15,

1737
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,280
like the duke,
the Duke who?

1738
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,690
Kim stuff.
When Ray.

1739
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:43,990
I think like a lot of that shit was 
because of the 15 rounds,

1740
01:15:43,991 --> 01:15:45,640
you know what I mean?
Because of weight cutting back.

1741
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:50,641
Then of course these same day way in,
which is a real danger,

1742
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,810
but a 15 round.
I mean,

1743
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:57,243
it's funny,
we watched fighters in any professional 

1744
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:00,604
fight in combat sports.
You see them gassing and like the 

1745
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:03,430
second,
you know,

1746
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:07,180
Larry Holmes had tits and was going big 
tits and he was going 15 easy.

1747
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:08,680
It's crazy.
You know,

1748
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:09,260
it's,
it's,

1749
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:12,350
it's just the human body is,
um,

1750
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:14,940
on understanding how to manage your 
energy to,

1751
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,630
of course,
of course,

1752
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:17,351
of course.
I mean,

1753
01:16:17,351 --> 01:16:21,370
when you come out in the first couple 
and you just letting shots fly,

1754
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:23,770
then you danced in the middle.
That's not a shock.

1755
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

1756
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:26,380
That's,
it's,

1757
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,200
it can work,
but when it doesn't work,

1758
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:30,940
you're fucked.
Exactly.

1759
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:33,070
Yeah.
When you ice them in the second you look

1760
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:35,110
like you have a,
you had a brilliant game plan.

1761
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:36,820
When you're Gaston,
the seventh.

1762
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:38,720
People are questioning,
you know,

1763
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,850
your ability,
your ring,

1764
01:16:39,851 --> 01:16:43,050
I kill your,
your corner to risk it.

1765
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:46,690
It's a heavy risk to throw all your 
artillery at someone in the first round.

1766
01:16:46,691 --> 01:16:47,910
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1767
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:52,870
It's just such a fascinating sport.
I love all combat sports,

1768
01:16:52,871 --> 01:16:57,871
but one of the things about boxing is 
it's a combat sport that has the longest

1769
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:01,530
richest history.
When you go back and you can walk,

1770
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:02,680
I mean,
when Teddy was here,

1771
01:17:02,681 --> 01:17:04,900
we were watching Max schmeling versus 
Joe Lewis,

1772
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,793
second fight and you know,
you could go back and watch some of the 

1773
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,100
sugar ray Robinson's greatest

1774
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,410
Henry Armstrong man.
I mean,

1775
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:15,240
you get to see the rich history of 
boxing.

1776
01:17:15,241 --> 01:17:19,850
Then you look at Jack Johnson fighting 
with those black and white films.

1777
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,740
Jack Dempsey.
Gene.

1778
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:23,051
Yeah,
man,

1779
01:17:23,051 --> 01:17:24,860
it's crazy.
It's beautiful that we have that.

1780
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:28,290
Has the audience with hats on.
What was that about?

1781
01:17:28,291 --> 01:17:30,440
I don't know,
like the old days dudes all wore.

1782
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:34,370
How strange?
Very strange.

1783
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:35,950
I mean there's,
there's a,

1784
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:36,783
there's a history to box.
He meant no other sport could really 

1785
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,700
come close to.
Agreed.

1786
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:41,560
No,
no.

1787
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,251
I'm uh,
I'm uh,

1788
01:17:42,251 --> 01:17:43,084
uh,
always have been a giant fan of boxing 

1789
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:47,060
before mma came around.
I mean,

1790
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:47,894
that was really all you had to watch.
You could watch a little bit of 

1791
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:53,150
kickboxing on television.
Rarely,

1792
01:17:53,151 --> 01:17:54,590
but it was always bad.
Well,

1793
01:17:54,591 --> 01:17:58,220
the other thing was those guys were 
superstars.

1794
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:01,010
The heavyweight champ of the world when 
we were younger was,

1795
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:02,103
yeah,
like if we walked out on the street 

1796
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:05,800
right now and as someone who the 
heavyweight champions,

1797
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,280
no one knows,
no one knows,

1798
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:10,580
some of them might say Mike Tyson,
but for the longest time the crazy thing

1799
01:18:10,581 --> 01:18:11,414
was it was a white guy and no one never 
like everybody when we're kids wanted a 

1800
01:18:15,141 --> 01:18:16,520
white heavyweight champion.

1801
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,290
That's why they pumped a Jew,
you know,

1802
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,990
Gerry Cooney.
So they were trying.

1803
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:22,340
Tommy Morrison.
Yup.

1804
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,450
They wanted it so bad,
you know what I mean?

1805
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:27,230
But know.
But like those got like,

1806
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,410
you know,
sugar ray Leonard was a hero.

1807
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:33,110
He's on woman's Donald's commercial.
It's like those that,

1808
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:34,530
those days are gone though,
you know,

1809
01:18:34,531 --> 01:18:37,610
it's become a niche.
It's now a niche sport again.

1810
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:39,020
You know what I mean?
Why do you think that is?

1811
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:40,220
I don't know.
I don't.

1812
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,083
I honestly don't know.
Is it because people got tired of 

1813
01:18:42,801 --> 01:18:44,390
corruption?
You know,

1814
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:47,170
I be,
I've talked to teddy and fights,

1815
01:18:47,171 --> 01:18:48,890
you know,
not at length like you did,

1816
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,620
but when,
you know,

1817
01:18:50,621 --> 01:18:52,280
when I go to fights and he's calling 
them,

1818
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:53,114
I always pay my respect,
but I'm not sure how or why or when it 

1819
01:18:57,651 --> 01:19:02,651
shifted that shift from the eighties or 
early nineties and then that's it,

1820
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:04,191
you know,
it was,

1821
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,330
it might go into jail.

1822
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,590
I don't know,
was it,

1823
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,430
you know,
de la de la Hoya was huge,

1824
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:14,240
but I don't know.
I don't know why,

1825
01:19:14,241 --> 01:19:16,650
why these dudes were like,
you know,

1826
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:21,050
the Ali was the most well known,
well known athlete ever.

1827
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:22,730
Maybe.
Probably close to it,

1828
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:23,703
you know?
I don't know who else would beat him if 

1829
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:26,330
Jordan by name.
You know what I mean?

1830
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,790
What was really interesting was when 
Larry Holmes was a champ,

1831
01:19:28,791 --> 01:19:29,624
nobody gave a shit because he had to 
fill the void of between Ali and he was 

1832
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:36,730
between Ali and Tyson,
you know,

1833
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:41,740
the tool,
the tool to basically transcended.

1834
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:46,130
Meanwhile the Ali that beat the fuck out
of Gerry Cooney,

1835
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,280
I would've loved to see him against 
Tyson.

1836
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:49,970
That's a different house.
I mean,

1837
01:19:49,971 --> 01:19:50,960
not Ali,
excuse me,

1838
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:52,520
Larry Holmes,
Larry Holmes,

1839
01:19:52,521 --> 01:19:53,354
and beat the fuck out of Jersey.
Came out of retirement for that payday 

1840
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:59,810
against it looks out of shape.
Still look good in the second round.

1841
01:19:59,811 --> 01:20:02,570
Up until he got what he was dancing 
prime.

1842
01:20:02,571 --> 01:20:04,670
Larry gives Mike problems all day.
Yes,

1843
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:08,250
a prime larry was a beast.
He was a special

1844
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,830
fighter.
He had a tremendous job.

1845
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:12,810
May the best heavyweight jab I ever saw 
when he,

1846
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,800
the the Ali that fought Larry Holmes was
an old broken down.

1847
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:20,130
They shouldn't ever let that fight take 
place.

1848
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,350
A shell of himself.
It's horrible to watch.

1849
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:26,520
But that Larry Holmes,
Larry Holmes would have given Mike Tyson

1850
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:28,350
fits.
It was a different Larry.

1851
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,510
Absolutely.
He was a monster when he was young.

1852
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:33,690
Absolute Long Snapping Jab,
criminally,

1853
01:20:33,691 --> 01:20:36,480
underrated in history.
Eddy futz trained.

1854
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:38,130
Yes.
I mean,

1855
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:39,053
you know,
Eddie Fudge maybe the best train of all 

1856
01:20:41,251 --> 01:20:42,750
time.
One of them for sure,

1857
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:44,310
but,
but again,

1858
01:20:44,311 --> 01:20:45,144
like you said,
things at time and placement and 

1859
01:20:46,981 --> 01:20:49,200
everything.
Music to comedy.

1860
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:50,034
Some,
some,

1861
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,500
some brilliant comedian slipped through 
the cracks,

1862
01:20:52,501 --> 01:20:55,440
through the what was happening at that 
time in comedy.

1863
01:20:55,441 --> 01:20:56,274
And,
and with,

1864
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:57,960
and with Larry,
it's like Yo,

1865
01:20:57,961 --> 01:21:00,960
you came after the most popular fighter 
of all time ever.

1866
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,850
And before Mike who,
you know,

1867
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:03,684
again,
two dudes who transcended the sport and 

1868
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:09,960
he beat up the most popular fighter of 
all time and everybody knew it was long,

1869
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:10,794
long over.

1870
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,370
Yeah.
So he can't,

1871
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:14,213
he wasn't happy about that.
And then he talks shit about Marsianno 

1872
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:19,260
which didn't endear them to,
that was a mistake.

1873
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:21,360
He said Marciano couldn't carry his 
jockstrap.

1874
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:25,800
That's my son's name.
My son's name Graziano.

1875
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:30,870
So that hurt one a little bit.
Yeah.

1876
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:32,280
It's,
you know,

1877
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,790
Larry just just had poor timing 
unfortunately for him.

1878
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:36,683
Yeah.
You know,

1879
01:21:36,770 --> 01:21:38,020
he's,
he's,

1880
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:38,943
he was very smart with his money though 
because I still see him at the fights 

1881
01:21:42,270 --> 01:21:43,950
he's paid.
That's good.

1882
01:21:43,951 --> 01:21:44,784
Yeah.
That's good to hear because you know as 

1883
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:47,700
well as I do.
What happens to some fighters?

1884
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:48,593
Well,
didn't he owned like a Shitload of 

1885
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:50,970
things?
Easton,

1886
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:51,804
Pennsylvania just took over eastern.
He did bought like car dealerships and 

1887
01:21:55,341 --> 01:21:57,360
car washes and shit like that.
Yeah.

1888
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:59,940
Larry was smart man and he's still talk 
shit to.

1889
01:21:59,970 --> 01:22:01,110
Does he?
Yeah.

1890
01:22:01,111 --> 01:22:04,860
Like remember when he came back and he 
boxed the face off a ray mercer.

1891
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:11,030
He was older shit when he met with 
butter bean and yes he is still.

1892
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:13,470
He still had it and he's in when Mike 
Tyson went to jail.

1893
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:15,120
He's like,
as long as Mike Tyson is jail,

1894
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,160
that's great.
I'll keep fighting.

1895
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,570
It was hilarious.
Yeah.

1896
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:24,150
Larry Holmes was something special for a
lot of people.

1897
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,760
He slipped through the cracks.
People in the know know though.

1898
01:22:26,850 --> 01:22:28,520
That's what's most important I think.
Yeah.

1899
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:30,420
Yeah,
that's true.

1900
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,313
Yeah,
that's true.

1901
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:34,290
I mean,
and then Trevor Berbick fight Ali too,

1902
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:35,124
right?
Yes.

1903
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,970
So yeah,
or second to last,

1904
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:39,804
but he was,
the Parkinson's was already starting 

1905
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:42,140
man,
you know,

1906
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:43,023
because you think of him a couple of 
years later at Tyson when Tyson be 

1907
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:48,450
Berbick and he was trembling then.
You know what I mean?

1908
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,270
Like,
so that's.

1909
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,290
We talk about,
you don't play boxing,

1910
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,193
you don't play.
Don't play him in May if you know your 

1911
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:56,970
life.

1912
01:22:56,970 --> 01:22:58,590
It's interesting to that.
Ali,

1913
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,453
you know,
I always liked to watch that fight with 

1914
01:23:01,741 --> 01:23:02,574
um,
jerry quarry because it was after three 

1915
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:05,700
years off.
Yeah.

1916
01:23:05,701 --> 01:23:08,020
Man.
And you see his body looks different.

1917
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:09,580
Yeah.
It just looks softer.

1918
01:23:09,830 --> 01:23:14,290
You if you see Ali versus like Cleveland
Williams and then he see Ali three years

1919
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:15,910
later,
after all that time off,

1920
01:23:15,911 --> 01:23:17,860
he just doesn't look the same.
He was never really the same.

1921
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:20,560
He wasn't with you.
When you think about why he did it,

1922
01:23:20,561 --> 01:23:21,394
imagine having the constitution to give 
away the prime of your fighting career 

1923
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:29,950
to not do that.
It's very special because they want them

1924
01:23:29,951 --> 01:23:33,040
to fight in the Vietnam war is like,
this is a bullshit bullshit.

1925
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,240
None of them ever called.
He said,

1926
01:23:34,241 --> 01:23:36,580
none of them have called me the n word.
You know what I mean?

1927
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:40,240
I'm not going over there to do that.
They took three prime yet,

1928
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,660
you know,
you got that window as a fighter man.

1929
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:46,960
It's like four to six years and he and 
half of it was taken.

1930
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,860
It's kind of amazing too that they did 
that and then they gave it back to him.

1931
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:52,630
They let him fight again.
I don't know.

1932
01:23:52,631 --> 01:23:55,600
What was the circumstances like how did 
they reinstate his boxing?

1933
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,850
I actually don't remember.
I don't know either,

1934
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,920
but I remember when he fought frazier,
I was like,

1935
01:23:59,921 --> 01:24:00,754
man,
I would have loved to see this fight 

1936
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:04,330
three years ago because he just was a 
different guy,

1937
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,480
but who's way too flat footed?
It just was a different guy.

1938
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,810
Yeah,
I will.

1939
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:10,713
The Joe,
because Joe and Joe in the Ali hated 

1940
01:24:13,121 --> 01:24:13,990
each other.
For Real.

1941
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:14,950
For Real.
Yeah,

1942
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:16,350
because he was,
you know,

1943
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:18,670
I lead with saying horrible,
horrible shit.

1944
01:24:19,230 --> 01:24:21,400
He's trying to fuck with his head and 
that's why I do it.

1945
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,650
He was the original shit talker.

1946
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:25,290
Do you think about it?
It's like you,

1947
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:27,340
you,
you see conor and you're like,

1948
01:24:27,341 --> 01:24:28,720
that's highly.
Oh yeah.

1949
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,770
Know what I mean?
For sure.

1950
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:32,870
Like ric flair.
Flair.

1951
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,710
Yeah.
This is a little bit of both of them.

1952
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:36,521
They're too.
Well,

1953
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:38,810
you remember when Henry Cooper knocked 
down Ali?

1954
01:24:39,450 --> 01:24:40,990
That was like the biggest thing in the 
UK.

1955
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:45,210
I heard him bad and then Angelo.
Dundee cut the gloves.

1956
01:24:45,211 --> 01:24:48,100
Yeah.
I mean if it wasn't for that move,

1957
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,970
Ali could have lost by stoppage very 
easily.

1958
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:52,863
Absolutely.
Got fucking craft craft flight right on 

1959
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:58,240
the fucking button and sat down.
He was on Queer Street.

1960
01:24:58,270 --> 01:24:59,230
Oh,
100 percent.

1961
01:24:59,231 --> 01:24:59,680
Yeah.
Yeah.

1962
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:02,140
He had a house on Queer Street.
He was picking up the mail.

1963
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:04,540
Here it is right here.
Boom.

1964
01:25:06,220 --> 01:25:08,610
Punch that again.
I mean,

1965
01:25:09,130 --> 01:25:11,560
that is a fucking picture.
Perfect.

1966
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:12,271
Lefthand.
I mean,

1967
01:25:12,271 --> 01:25:13,104
looking at him right on the button.
He is staggering back to his corner and 

1968
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:16,990
it happened.

1969
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:21,520
Luckily for him at the very end of the.
But I'll back then.

1970
01:25:21,521 --> 01:25:22,630
Right?
This was Cassius clay.

1971
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:24,640
Correct.
So this is before he fought.

1972
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:28,570
Was it before he fought Sonny Liston and
want to say it was.

1973
01:25:28,571 --> 01:25:30,230
It was,
yeah.

1974
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,740
Whew,
man.

1975
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:35,380
Who knows that cheated him though.
Yeah,

1976
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:36,940
they did.
They cheated him.

1977
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,080
It's different world.
Oh,

1978
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:40,180
we got to change gloves.
They give him a long ass time.

1979
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,680
Oh,
we gotta undo these laces.

1980
01:25:41,681 --> 01:25:42,940
Cut this.
Cut this tape.

1981
01:25:42,941 --> 01:25:44,110
Brilliant though.
Yeah.

1982
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,160
Wow.
Hey Angelo.

1983
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:46,930
Dundee.
He wasn't a newcomer.

1984
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:47,740
No,
it was not.

1985
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:50,020
He knew what the fuck he was doing.
He was great.

1986
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:53,350
Yeah.
My favorite stoppage of all Ali's fights

1987
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:56,320
is Cleveland.
Big Cat Williams because he hit him with

1988
01:25:56,321 --> 01:26:01,321
these just welterweight combinations 
being he did it pop up.

1989
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:02,193
Pop Up.
Yeah,

1990
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:07,490
I mean he was throwing it really.
I never saw anyone throw combinations,

1991
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:09,710
a heavyweight like that before.

1992
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:14,720
Combinations like Ray Robinson and the 
fluidity of this was.

1993
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,110
It was one of my all time favorite.
[inaudible] Williams was a scary fucking

1994
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:18,944
dude too.
He was a big puncher and Ali was just 

1995
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:25,460
lying on their body.
No one does that anymore.

1996
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,353
Yeah,
and Williams just kept pressing for 

1997
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,570
pressing forward.
We'll leave.

1998
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,190
Williams is a big puncher,
man.

1999
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,490
He could crack.
He just couldn't find Ali and Ali was so

2000
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:39,310
loose in front of them.
They look at that beautiful.

2001
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,260
He's a chef.
Boom,

2002
01:26:42,410 --> 01:26:43,340
check,
left hook,

2003
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:45,200
move around,
and then once,

2004
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:50,260
once he started tuning them up the body 
and then back up top is beautiful man.

2005
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:51,780
Beautiful Man.
Yeah,

2006
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:52,940
this is art.
This is art,

2007
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:53,774
right?
It's because there was never a heavy 

2008
01:26:55,281 --> 01:26:56,114
weight that moved like this.
People have to realize this didn't 

2009
01:26:58,371 --> 01:27:01,280
exist,
man and rarely does exist.

2010
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:06,430
The only guy who moves even remotely 
like this today is Tyson fury.

2011
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:09,050
Tyson fury can move.
He can bro.

2012
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:12,020
Motherfucker can dance.
He can.

2013
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:14,150
He dances and he's six foot.
What?

2014
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:17,180
Nine or eight or some shit.
I think he's huge.

2015
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:19,370
He gets clipped a little too much for 
me.

2016
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:21,230
He definitely gets tagged.
Yeah.

2017
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,093
He got.
He got tagged by Steve Cunningham from 

2018
01:27:23,961 --> 01:27:27,530
Philly and dropped.
That's the cruiserweight was even crate.

2019
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,420
I'm like always Chin might not be all 
there.

2020
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:30,291
Well,
you know what?

2021
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:34,010
Cunningham's a shorter guy and sometimes
for those really tall fighters it's very

2022
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:36,920
difficult to punch down.
That's how Mike was getting over because

2023
01:27:36,921 --> 01:27:41,921
he was in the chest and he was real head
movement and the and the Pika bull that,

2024
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:45,620
you know,
the custom model developed pulled up,

2025
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:46,454
put the end of that fight up so I could 
see the combinations that led to the 

2026
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:51,404
stoppage.
See once once he had williamson trouble 

2027
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:55,160
go big screen.

2028
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:56,960
I mean even their bombbomb.
Bombbomb.

2029
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:59,310
Yeah.
Like once Williams,

2030
01:27:59,311 --> 01:28:02,900
his face had been jabbed off and joe the
craziest thing,

2031
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:05,540
a beautiful.
The craziest thing about him is everyone

2032
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:08,780
historically has to sit down on their 
punches to get leverage on him.

2033
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,450
He did it.
He's dancing and yeah,

2034
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,620
my mom,
bombbomb and.

2035
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:15,620
Well he wasn't trying to knock you out 
with every punch.

2036
01:28:15,621 --> 01:28:18,340
He was just cracking you papa,
Papa,

2037
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:22,300
and when you're getting peppered,
that's fucking tough to deal with.

2038
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:23,563
Rough to deal with.
It's frustrating because you're in your 

2039
01:28:25,761 --> 01:28:26,211
head.
You're like,

2040
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:28,010
if I touched this mother fucker,
I heard them,

2041
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:30,010
but you can't touch her and you just 
keep getting peppered.

2042
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:33,050
Actually your legs start wobbling.
Fight Willie pep.

2043
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:34,660
Yeah.
You know he,

2044
01:28:34,770 --> 01:28:36,810
he had the,
you know,

2045
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,070
the footwork of Chili pepper and a 
heavyweight I'm fucking hurt of.

2046
01:28:41,180 --> 01:28:42,740
That's another guy that people forgot 
about.

2047
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:46,120
Willie pep was one of the rare guys that
one around without throwing a punch.

2048
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:46,970
Yes.
Yes.

2049
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:48,530
Like what the fuck,
man.

2050
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,360
Unbelievable.
Anna Dego.

2051
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:51,530
Yes.
Yes.

2052
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:52,383
Steve.
We got a lot of good ones back in the 

2053
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,820
day.
Maybe not so much now.

2054
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:58,940
Joseph had Iran.
We had lamata.

2055
01:28:58,950 --> 01:29:02,220
We know Graziano well.
The community

2056
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,070
got established as a problem.
People start doing well.

2057
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:07,290
Exactly.
Then they get soft.

2058
01:29:07,291 --> 01:29:08,430
Exactly,
exactly.

2059
01:29:08,431 --> 01:29:10,280
The last guy we had was our total 
godaddy.

2060
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:12,100
That really rapid.
Yeah.

2061
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:13,720
To really rapping,
you know?

2062
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

2063
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,130
It's,
it's,

2064
01:29:16,170 --> 01:29:17,330
that's how it goes though,
right?

2065
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:19,830
The early immigrants,
the ones that get shit on there,

2066
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,770
the ones who come up strong or tough 
fighters and then,

2067
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:26,930
you know,
now it's Cubans and Russians and yeah,

2068
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,660
you'll come from that raw,
that Russian amateur program.

2069
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:33,120
Like there's no fucking joke.
Right.

2070
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,130
That's one of the reasons why I love 
Loma Chenko.

2071
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:37,210
He,
that guys you're talking about.

2072
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:40,950
Yeah.
I haven't seen anything.

2073
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:45,600
It's a maybe 30 years.
I haven't seen anything like him.

2074
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,630
I work.
It's ridiculous.

2075
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:49,493
I've never seen someone.
He's in a position to not throw a punch 

2076
01:29:52,831 --> 01:29:55,270
and throws a beautiful three punch 
comedy.

2077
01:29:55,271 --> 01:29:56,790
I don't even know.
I mean the,

2078
01:29:56,910 --> 01:29:57,743
you know,
they call them the matrix or high tech 

2079
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:00,720
to perfect names.
But I mean,

2080
01:30:00,721 --> 01:30:02,280
I've never,
I've never seen anything like,

2081
01:30:02,281 --> 01:30:04,090
um,
maybe um,

2082
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:05,393
maybe a prime.
Roy Choi was different too because it 

2083
01:30:08,881 --> 01:30:13,190
was technically awful.
He just had such reflex when they went,

2084
01:30:13,220 --> 01:30:16,650
that's when he got melted because.
Because he never.

2085
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,500
He didn't Jab.
No,

2086
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,530
he didn't do anything.
Right.

2087
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:23,460
Hook left hook.
What rights from weird angles.

2088
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,470
And it worked because his reflexes were 
super human.

2089
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,333
He was superman and then as soon as they
deteriorate a little bit and in 

2090
01:30:30,691 --> 01:30:33,360
fighting,
you can deteriorate a little bit.

2091
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:34,570
In baseball,
you're going to tear it.

2092
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:37,450
Got Roy would really got Roy.
My opinion.

2093
01:30:37,451 --> 01:30:39,030
I'm a giant.
Roy Jones Jr fan.

2094
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,200
He's my maybe one of my all time 
favorite fighters.

2095
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:45,380
What really got Roy's when we went up to
fight John Ruiz and then he went back to

2096
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:47,680
tarver.
He was depleted,

2097
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,543
depleted,
and I think when he went up to fight 

2098
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:52,840
Ruiz,
he might've had some Mexican supplements

2099
01:30:52,841 --> 01:30:54,040
in the system.
Wink,

2100
01:30:54,041 --> 01:30:54,431
wink,
nudge,

2101
01:30:54,431 --> 01:30:55,090
nudge.
Sure.

2102
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:57,640
Yeah.
I mean he was like 200 plus pounds

2103
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,031
two.
Oh,

2104
01:30:58,031 --> 01:30:59,610
eight or something.
Look good.

2105
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:01,390
I think he should've retired after that.
Win.

2106
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:04,300
Well,
he definitely should have consulted with

2107
01:31:04,301 --> 01:31:05,134
an endocrinologist and tried to figure 
out what system was and then the weight 

2108
01:31:08,891 --> 01:31:12,490
cut down to one 75 must have been brutal
because he was smooth.

2109
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:15,430
He looked like shit.
He lost all his muscle tone.

2110
01:31:15,940 --> 01:31:16,773
He just didn't.
He looked like a shredded in the 

2111
01:31:18,311 --> 01:31:19,480
nineties.
Exactly.

2112
01:31:19,481 --> 01:31:20,314
Yeah.
He looked like a guy who's system had 

2113
01:31:22,241 --> 01:31:26,530
been shut down with the thing that these
guys don't maybe don't recognize if they

2114
01:31:26,531 --> 01:31:28,530
take some shit or if they,
you know,

2115
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:33,070
even if you just cut too much weight,
your body stops producing hormones.

2116
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:34,840
Sure.
Your body's all fucked up.

2117
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:36,680
You're on,
you're on your way to die.

2118
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:39,010
Body's telling you,
what the fuck are you doing now?

2119
01:31:39,620 --> 01:31:39,800
He

2120
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,800
was 200 plus pounds when he fought Ruiz.
Then he has to cut down to one $75.

2121
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,353
Yeah.
Thirty.

2122
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,233
Yeah.
And who knows how sophisticated his 

2123
01:31:48,591 --> 01:31:49,424
methods were.
I mean,

2124
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:52,310
some fighters today are amazing at doing
that.

2125
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:54,290
I mean,
they know how to do it correctly.

2126
01:31:54,291 --> 01:31:58,910
They know how to rehydrate correctly and
boxing at least has the,

2127
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:00,310
um,
the benefit

2128
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:03,730
of not having Usada in place like the 
UFC does.

2129
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,833
The UFC has a real problem with a lack 
of Ivs and these guys can't rehydrate 

2130
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:13,030
correctly or the way that they want to 
is dangerous.

2131
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:14,283
It is dangerous,
but in their defense it's also a way 

2132
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:20,350
that they can detect a whether or not 
someone's cheating.

2133
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,243
Okay.
Because when they're using [inaudible] 

2134
01:32:22,170 --> 01:32:24,030
you can mask a lot of shit,
right?

2135
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:25,180
Yeah.
I didn't think about that.

2136
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:26,380
Yeah,
that's why they do it.

2137
01:32:26,381 --> 01:32:26,951
Okay.
Yeah.

2138
01:32:26,951 --> 01:32:30,010
They just won't let you do it.
So when,

2139
01:32:30,220 --> 01:32:32,530
I don't know what happened with Roy when
he did put it in,

2140
01:32:32,531 --> 01:32:33,364
you can't take anything away from tarver
either because Tarver almost beat Roy 

2141
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:39,580
the first time they fought,
but then fucked him up.

2142
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:41,650
Fucking flew his head.
Yeah.

2143
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:44,440
And the famous words.
Any excuses Roy,

2144
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:46,970
right before they fired or anything like
that.

2145
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:48,100
He was so confident.

2146
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,430
I think he gets his due either.
No,

2147
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,550
he doesn't.
He doesn't.

2148
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:53,680
He uh,
he had some great wins.

2149
01:32:54,220 --> 01:32:55,860
He had some great wins.
Um,

2150
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,710
he's still at it too.
Heavyweight or something like 46,

2151
01:32:59,711 --> 01:33:02,680
47.
And he said he got popped for steroids.

2152
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,240
So.
Well,

2153
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:05,183
Duh.
If you're 45 and you're still looking 

2154
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:08,890
good,
there's something going on.

2155
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:11,690
The only the only person I truly believe
in it.

2156
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:14,170
I realize you'll,
you'll think I'm biased because of where

2157
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:15,004
I'm from,
but I don't think Barnard ever did 

2158
01:33:15,791 --> 01:33:17,200
anything.
I don't think he did anything either,

2159
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:19,870
but narges just lives clean.
I've seen him,

2160
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:21,323
uh,
order grilled chicken and get chicken 

2161
01:33:23,021 --> 01:33:26,960
that was fried by accident and peel the 
fry off of it rather than just go,

2162
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:27,970
oh,
just this.

2163
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:31,630
Once I'll do it.
I watched him take it off to just,

2164
01:33:31,660 --> 01:33:32,493
you know,
what it means to not eat that is just 

2165
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,253
insane.

2166
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:38,710
Dietary in the gym,
you know,

2167
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,753
I agree.
But the Joe Smith fight was sad to 

2168
01:33:41,531 --> 01:33:43,150
watch.
Of course that was,

2169
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:44,013
that was,
uh,

2170
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:47,700
the Cova left fight was sad.
I was ringside but,

2171
01:33:47,701 --> 01:33:49,460
and I love Kovalev.
Yeah.

2172
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:51,160
But it's,
you know,

2173
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:52,420
officially legend,
like,

2174
01:33:52,421 --> 01:33:53,920
ah man,
this is rough.

2175
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:54,813
You know,
it's crazy to see how deep into his 

2176
01:33:56,981 --> 01:33:57,814
career he was still successful.
Like I wrote a blog article about Kelly 

2177
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:03,143
Pavlik fight because I'm like,
I don't remember how old he was at the 

2178
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:05,614
time,
but everybody had already written them 

2179
01:34:06,161 --> 01:34:07,900
off.
My brother and I were there,

2180
01:34:07,901 --> 01:34:08,734
like Pavlics gonna beat the dog shit off
and on and gave him a fucking lasting 

2181
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:13,633
lesson.
He put on a clinic where people have to 

2182
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:17,200
realize he was technically passed is 
fine,

2183
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:19,070
is primarily fucked up.
Tito treasures.

2184
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:19,963
Thirty 6:30.
It was 36 and 2001 that was two weeks 

2185
01:34:24,311 --> 01:34:26,530
after nine slash 11 that fight and he 
was 36.

2186
01:34:26,531 --> 01:34:27,740
That.
How crazy is that?

2187
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:32,500
What was he when he fought Joe Smith?
50 slash 50 maybe.

2188
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:34,810
Maybe 51.
Definitely 50.

2189
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,790
Crazy.
So he was he.

2190
01:34:37,390 --> 01:34:39,780
I'd say he lasted 15 years.
Longer than.

2191
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:42,660
Than the average guy.
You know what?

2192
01:34:42,661 --> 01:34:44,880
How about when he came back and boxed 
Roy Junior?

2193
01:34:44,970 --> 01:34:46,360
Yeah.
Well Roy,

2194
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,223
when Roy beat him the first time was 
beaten him with all those reflex reflex 

2195
01:34:50,261 --> 01:34:51,094
is slid off.
Clearly outbox the second slide with 

2196
01:34:53,980 --> 01:34:56,230
just fundamentals.
Perfect.

2197
01:34:56,231 --> 01:34:58,040
Mechanical Roya didn't them.
He didn't have

2198
01:34:58,040 --> 01:34:58,700
them.
Yeah,

2199
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:01,850
just relying on what was once there,
but it wasn't.

2200
01:35:01,851 --> 01:35:04,160
He was a shell of his,
of his form itself.

2201
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:06,230
Well,
it was also the Glen Johnson fight was a

2202
01:35:06,231 --> 01:35:08,630
scary knockout.
He was on Queer Street.

2203
01:35:08,631 --> 01:35:09,464
Yeah.
Well he was just flatlined and astral 

2204
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:13,910
traveling after the got knocked out by 
tarver.

2205
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,230
Then there was not that much time in 
between those two funds.

2206
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,250
It was.
It was the next fight.

2207
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:20,280
Yeah.
Yeah,

2208
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:23,630
and he,
those knockouts where your.

2209
01:35:23,710 --> 01:35:24,543
You're out on your feet before you hit 
the ground and your head hits the 

2210
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:29,990
canvas,
which is two shots and he stiffened up.

2211
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:31,940
It was sad to watch.
It was.

2212
01:35:32,010 --> 01:35:34,160
It was.
I thought that was going to be the end.

2213
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:35,053
Me Too.
And then he started fighting like in 

2214
01:35:36,381 --> 01:35:38,420
Russia,
sanctioned over there.

2215
01:35:38,421 --> 01:35:40,240
And he's a Russian citizen.
Yes ma'am.

2216
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:42,860
Bizarro world pussy involved.

2217
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:45,853
He's got to have some toto over them and
to do that when you're talking about 

2218
01:35:48,411 --> 01:35:49,730
Larry Holmes and looked up his 
wikipedia,

2219
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:51,830
his last fight was in 2002.
Again,

2220
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:55,850
butter bean is 51 or so and he put it on
butter bean.

2221
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,450
10 round fight.
That's crazy.

2222
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:04,280
Butter bean can crack that.
Big motherfucker hit hard.

2223
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:05,683
But Larry just snake that snake and 
getting through that pop every time he 

2224
01:36:10,311 --> 01:36:11,840
tries to come in and bunk by member 
that.

2225
01:36:11,841 --> 01:36:12,674
But due to where those golden palace was
the first person he did it under Tito 

2226
01:36:16,461 --> 01:36:16,881
fight,
man.

2227
01:36:16,881 --> 01:36:17,750
It.
Was that the first.

2228
01:36:18,250 --> 01:36:19,610
Yeah,
that was so weird.

2229
01:36:19,820 --> 01:36:23,240
Someone did it in the UFC to the.
They wore that shit on their back.

2230
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:24,600
It's odd.
Yeah.

2231
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,120
Put it on your trunks.
Are you going to do it?

2232
01:36:26,121 --> 01:36:28,760
I guess you don't get as much money,
but it's,

2233
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:32,180
it is.
I Know Bernard got 50 k to put it on his

2234
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:34,730
back and he bet it on himself against 
Tito.

2235
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:35,720
Real.
Yeah.

2236
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,310
And you know,
he was a huge underdog.

2237
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:40,320
Everyone.
Everyone thought Tito was going to whoop

2238
01:36:40,321 --> 01:36:41,690
his ass.
Everyone.

2239
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:43,110
Everyone,
you know,

2240
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:46,170
I was jumping off my brother's couch 
when.

2241
01:36:47,730 --> 01:36:48,800
Yeah,
he fucked them up.

2242
01:36:48,830 --> 01:36:49,700
Yeah man.
Yeah.

2243
01:36:49,701 --> 01:36:52,730
Bernard was a special athlete.
He really was absolutely special.

2244
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:53,810
Fight all time.
Great.

2245
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:55,003
For sure.
Yeah,

2246
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,060
definitely.
Yeah,

2247
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:57,273
and it was interesting because I used to
watch him when he was in his thirties 

2248
01:37:00,171 --> 01:37:01,004
and he would complain about crooked 
promoters and all these things and my 

2249
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:04,041
thought was,
man,

2250
01:37:04,041 --> 01:37:04,874
it's too bad.
This guy missed his prime and then he 

2251
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:09,200
did what he did and then he did what he 
did after the.

2252
01:37:09,201 --> 01:37:10,160
After.
Yeah,

2253
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,130
because he got,
he,

2254
01:37:11,130 --> 01:37:11,963
he was in jail for like strong arm 
robbery and got out and kind of like 

2255
01:37:15,621 --> 01:37:18,950
wallowed in obscurity and then his shot 
was at Roy fight,

2256
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:19,880
you know,
and I.

2257
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:21,140
and so we were like,
ah,

2258
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:24,110
you got your shot.
I guess that's it just got better,

2259
01:37:24,350 --> 01:37:25,790
you know,
better with age,

2260
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:28,580
just show man.
It's like the rarest thing in anything.

2261
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:30,470
Well,
the discipline that he had,

2262
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:34,640
that's what it's extraordinary 
discipline in his mindset.

2263
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:37,730
It should be a lesson to everyone.
Yeah.

2264
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:38,623
You know the,
that the discipline and dedication to 

2265
01:37:41,511 --> 01:37:44,870
whatever you want to do can be achieved 
through that.

2266
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,900
And he's still in good shape.
Amazing shuts.

2267
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:48,920
The other thing,
he doesn't say no,

2268
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:50,060
never,
never.

2269
01:37:50,061 --> 01:37:52,220
I see him at the fight.
She's still the same.

2270
01:37:52,990 --> 01:37:54,950
Yeah.
Chubby now,

2271
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,180
you know,
but I don't blame those.

2272
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,140
Like when the ran got really big,
that dude was cutting when he was trying

2273
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:01,974
to make 1:35
and all that and he just kept going off 

2274
01:38:04,531 --> 01:38:05,600
because he'd like to eat.
Yeah.

2275
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:07,860
Only for Iran.
Barkley at one 68.

2276
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:10,140
It's a doodle.
Turned 35.

2277
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,990
I remember when he fucked up David 
Morris,

2278
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:15,690
that was unreal.
What is this?

2279
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:18,170
Everybody thought David Moore,
this young lions,

2280
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:23,060
lions destroyed this old legend and 
Roberta thumbed marines in my top five.

2281
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,380
All time.
In any weight class.

2282
01:38:25,381 --> 01:38:26,280
Top Five.
Yeah.

2283
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:27,061
Well,
I always tell people,

2284
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:29,970
if you really want to watch Roberta,
you gotta wash the lightweight Roberta.

2285
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:32,190
Well,
before he even went to fight Leonard the

2286
01:38:32,191 --> 01:38:36,330
black and white fights because if can 
and most right most can be.

2287
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:37,171
Oh,
that's beautiful.

2288
01:38:37,171 --> 01:38:41,760
Most people in America think of Doran 
from like sugar ray on.

2289
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:42,843
I'm like,
you want to see art and and just subtle 

2290
01:38:46,261 --> 01:38:49,440
shit on the inside than he did.
He was doing before Chavez.

2291
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:50,453
That little subtle shit on the inside 
and picking off shots that people don't 

2292
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:54,600
know.
His defense.

2293
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,770
He was eating none of those shots from 
inside and then bang the body and all of

2294
01:38:58,771 --> 01:38:58,950
that.

2295
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:00,360
That those fights were all.
Yes,

2296
01:39:00,361 --> 01:39:02,460
he was great at 40,
47,

2297
01:39:02,730 --> 01:39:05,470
54 60.
He did amazing things and again,

2298
01:39:05,471 --> 01:39:07,620
that's why he's in my top five,
but you're right.

2299
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:10,920
If people want to see and watch those 
fights at lightweight.

2300
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,290
Yeah,
he came up and wait just to get paid.

2301
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:15,650
Of course he could have stayed at 
lightweight for a long time,

2302
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:17,010
of course,
and just dominated.

2303
01:39:17,011 --> 01:39:17,844
And I think I still,
even now I think he's the best 

2304
01:39:19,711 --> 01:39:20,860
lightweight ever.
Wow.

2305
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,440
I don't think there's any lightweight 
who was better.

2306
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,990
Well,
he was added back then,

2307
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:28,020
but that fucking dark Goti don't take 
the dog.

2308
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:31,350
I said once I'm on a post,
I said I,

2309
01:39:31,351 --> 01:39:32,850
if I,
if I'm in a dark alley,

2310
01:39:32,851 --> 01:39:35,010
I'm more scared of the rand and Tyson.
Really?

2311
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:37,740
Yes.
At all day.

2312
01:39:38,370 --> 01:39:41,960
That mother fucker will do some shit.
I don't know.

2313
01:39:41,970 --> 01:39:42,900
Mike's capable of.

2314
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,060
There was an interview where they went 
to see him in Panama and uh,

2315
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:50,460
he picked up a cat by the tail and smash
it against a brick wall.

2316
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:52,460
Okay.
I don't want to.

2317
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:54,230
I don't want to see you in and now.
Yeah.

2318
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:56,010
And,
and the interviewer was like,

2319
01:39:56,011 --> 01:39:57,150
what?
Yeah.

2320
01:39:57,510 --> 01:39:59,930
He just grabbed a cat and chucked it 
against a wall.

2321
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,333
Look,
man.

2322
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,300
I mean,
look,

2323
01:40:03,660 --> 01:40:05,440
there's a darkness to that.
Yeah.

2324
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,860
You're not a,
you know,

2325
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:08,720
a couple of sandwiches short of a 
picnic.

2326
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:12,760
Well,
I mean that you got to think about a god

2327
01:40:12,770 --> 01:40:15,240
growing up in Panama.
He did,

2328
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:18,810
and you're fighting for your life.
No rugs,

2329
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:20,570
no floor mudding.
Yeah.

2330
01:40:20,700 --> 01:40:21,533
That,
that's,

2331
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:22,583
that's another,
that's another level of poverty that we 

2332
01:40:25,501 --> 01:40:26,334
don't get.
Like when you say the very first thing 

2333
01:40:27,921 --> 01:40:29,910
you said in this interview where we were
born in America,

2334
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:33,930
we already had that one step above all 
these,

2335
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:34,590
you know what I mean?

2336
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:37,610
These,
you're talking about Castro's Cuba.

2337
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,450
Like he wouldn't let those amateurs 
leave Bro.

2338
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:40,433
They had to escape.
All those dudes had to escape every 

2339
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:45,120
Salon de Lata at his family's dead,
Bro.

2340
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,790
Like people.
These dudes to leave their family when a

2341
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:51,330
fucking boat.
Not a boat on a fucking raft.

2342
01:40:51,331 --> 01:40:52,060
Yup.
He,

2343
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,230
because Castro's like,
no,

2344
01:40:53,231 --> 01:40:55,520
we want to build the amateur program.
That's why Oregon,

2345
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:58,360
the I like,
he's got dudes and two Olympics.

2346
01:40:58,361 --> 01:40:59,194
You know,
you try to make it the one and then go 

2347
01:40:59,981 --> 01:41:02,590
pro and he won't let them,
the program.

2348
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,760
It's so,
you know,

2349
01:41:03,761 --> 01:41:06,810
I don't know if his son.
It seems like there's a shift.

2350
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:10,200
There's a shift culturally.
Romero comeback.

2351
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:12,940
Yeah.
Yoel Romero went back and he was hanging

2352
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:14,710
out there,
but he said it was very tense,

2353
01:41:14,711 --> 01:41:17,240
like you don't talk,
you don't say nothing really.

2354
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:18,131
He's like,
yeah.

2355
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:19,660
He goes,
because everybody's jealous.

2356
01:41:19,660 --> 01:41:22,510
They're all mad that you get to come 
back and forth because,

2357
01:41:22,511 --> 01:41:24,700
you know,
Yoel Romero top UFC fighter.

2358
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:28,600
He went back and I wouldn't,
I wouldn't go back.

2359
01:41:28,601 --> 01:41:29,790
I won't go bug,
you know,

2360
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:32,590
if I had the life I had here,
you know what I mean?

2361
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:34,630
And being a top guy and getting paid 
days.

2362
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,950
Yup.
Um,

2363
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:38,220
I,
I understand why he went back.

2364
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,430
Of course,
I understand why,

2365
01:41:39,431 --> 01:41:41,680
you know what I mean?
But if me and you go to Italy,

2366
01:41:41,681 --> 01:41:43,060
no,
we might not come back here.

2367
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,410
Look,
they can have it.

2368
01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:46,690
Yeah.
They could have pictures.

2369
01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:50,130
So I got family and we got what's 
happened.

2370
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,000
Shit,
whatever.

2371
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:53,920
Yeah.
I'm not interested in going anywhere.

2372
01:41:53,921 --> 01:41:55,140
I can't come back.
No Man,

2373
01:41:56,260 --> 01:41:57,093
but I just don't think we'll ever 
understand what it's like to be 

2374
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:02,710
essentially a prisoner in a communist.
Dictatorship.

2375
01:42:02,711 --> 01:42:04,510
Absolutely.
Grew up through the amateur program.

2376
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:05,423
When you all were married,
was on the podcast to Joey Diaz was 

2377
01:42:07,241 --> 01:42:10,270
translating for him,
was beautiful and he was explaining,

2378
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:11,123
you know,
what life is like in these amateur 

2379
01:42:12,920 --> 01:42:13,753
program.
You are sharing time with 10 other 

2380
01:42:16,271 --> 01:42:18,130
people that want your spot.
Yeah.

2381
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:19,720
And that's what you're doing all day 
long,

2382
01:42:19,721 --> 01:42:22,150
your training with 10 other things to 
do.

2383
01:42:22,151 --> 01:42:24,370
And that's all they do.
It's all they know,

2384
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,840
you know,
and,

2385
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:26,733
and you think about there's no scenario.
I'm jumping in shark infested waters on 

2386
01:42:31,631 --> 01:42:35,110
the fucking raft and if,
and if you're driven to do that,

2387
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:39,220
whatever drives you to do that must be 
fucking heavy man.

2388
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:40,583
You know,
and of course we don't him telling you 

2389
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:46,060
that allowed you into the mind of that 
fight.

2390
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,903
That's a very rare experience that you 
had to be that he shared that because a 

2391
01:42:50,501 --> 01:42:52,270
lot of these dudes don't get to tell 
their story.

2392
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:53,103
You know what I mean?
Or what it was like and the amateur 

2393
01:42:55,271 --> 01:42:58,090
program being stuck there.
Being a prisoner of your kid.

2394
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,130
Once these dudes get out,
you know,

2395
01:43:00,131 --> 01:43:02,710
like they'll do some of them,
there'll be like a,

2396
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:05,710
you know,
like there'll be an Olympic Games in say

2397
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:08,130
Europe and all escape from there.
Yup.

2398
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:10,730
They'll just dark after the fight.
That's what I was dol.

2399
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,220
Oh,
that's what it escaped in Germany.

2400
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:13,210
Okay.
Yeah.

2401
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:14,093
So,
um,

2402
01:43:14,140 --> 01:43:17,430
a couple of people did it the same thing
like Russia or wherever they were at for

2403
01:43:17,431 --> 01:43:20,420
games and got the fuck out.
I mean that,

2404
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:25,390
that,
that him getting in the ring after going

2405
01:43:25,391 --> 01:43:28,240
through that is cake,
you know what I mean?

2406
01:43:28,420 --> 01:43:30,040
That's,
this is,

2407
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:31,670
he's living the dream,
you know,

2408
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,593
training in a gym and sleeping on a,
sleeping on the bed sheets and it's 

2409
01:43:36,401 --> 01:43:37,350
like,
this is cake.

2410
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:37,751
Well,
you know,

2411
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:39,980
that's the shit we don't,
we don't appreciate.

2412
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,920
When I was talking about being a 
negative person,

2413
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:44,890
he was talking about near amateur 
program.

2414
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:46,300
If you do well,
if you're at the top,

2415
01:43:46,301 --> 01:43:48,760
you get three meals a day.
If you don't do so well,

2416
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:49,594
you get to like,
you're literally fighting for your 

2417
01:43:52,731 --> 01:43:54,770
ability to eat.
It's insane.

2418
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:57,540
Like we don't,
we can't understand the.

2419
01:43:57,550 --> 01:43:59,210
Oh man,
not on any level.

2420
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,490
No.
I mean,

2421
01:44:00,510 --> 01:44:03,630
imagine that's all you've ever known to.
Of course.

2422
01:44:03,631 --> 01:44:06,830
Let me see these slobs and America 
planing.

2423
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:08,450
Yes.
No,

2424
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:11,270
that's how I,
when I started seeing shit,

2425
01:44:11,330 --> 01:44:12,163
um,
some of the places in eastern Europe 

2426
01:44:13,941 --> 01:44:14,774
that were in part of the union yet and 
in squalor and getting two year olds 

2427
01:44:17,931 --> 01:44:19,400
asking me for money,
I'm like,

2428
01:44:19,401 --> 01:44:20,450
Yo man,
like,

2429
01:44:20,451 --> 01:44:21,930
get your shit together.
Meaning me,

2430
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:23,303
Yogi,
Eli,

2431
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:25,400
get you your way of thinking.

2432
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,950
Change it because this is what this is,
this,

2433
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:31,010
this kid's reality.
She's a two year old girl.

2434
01:44:31,070 --> 01:44:33,620
Her mom's telling you to come over,
you know,

2435
01:44:33,621 --> 01:44:35,430
asking me for yarrow.
Yeah,

2436
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:37,550
that's,
that's a game changer.

2437
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:42,770
How and if that doesn't change you,
that I don't know,

2438
01:44:42,771 --> 01:44:43,940
man,
there's your off.

2439
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:47,270
The biggest mind fuck is that if you 
make $35,000,

2440
01:44:47,271 --> 01:44:48,104
you're in the one percent of the world 
when people talk about one percent as 

2441
01:44:51,351 --> 01:44:54,050
you think about people with yachts and 
private jets.

2442
01:44:54,051 --> 01:44:56,610
And of course fucking diamond rings.
Nope.

2443
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:00,020
Nope.
One percent is $35,000

2444
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:01,370
a year for the world.
Yeah,

2445
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:02,780
man.
Yeah,

2446
01:45:02,781 --> 01:45:04,130
that's,
that's sobering.

2447
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,850
That's scary.
You know,

2448
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:08,840
when you travel a lot,
like where's your favorite places to go?

2449
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:09,681
Yeah,
I know you do.

2450
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:10,341
Europe,
you,

2451
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:11,780
you,
you travel all over the place.

2452
01:45:11,781 --> 01:45:12,790
Touring.
Um,

2453
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:16,190
I love Scandinavia really?
Is that.

2454
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,300
I don't know.
I like,

2455
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,720
I,
I hate the heat row.

2456
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:21,320
Oh yeah.
I'm like one of those dudes with the air

2457
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:24,890
conditioners on 24 hours and it's 30 
degrees.

2458
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:29,570
Um,
it's mega clean to super clear.

2459
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,520
It looks fake.
It looks like a,

2460
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:34,490
like a movie set.
Really?

2461
01:45:34,491 --> 01:45:36,350
Yeah,
but the crowds are crazy.

2462
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,990
I mean I'm from Italy,
so of course I love that.

2463
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,863
Australia was incredible,
but I almost had a nervous breakdown on 

2464
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:44,440
the flight because it's too long,
bro.

2465
01:45:45,740 --> 01:45:47,720
Flight Nav,
man,

2466
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:49,050
Bro.
It's five hours.

2467
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:53,510
Five or six hours from philly and then 
you fly out of lax and was another 17.

2468
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:58,370
This is a 17 that's really heavy.
If you leave from Philly it's 22.

2469
01:45:58,430 --> 01:45:59,263
Right?
That's.

2470
01:46:00,350 --> 01:46:01,850
Look man,
look man,

2471
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:03,530
how,
how much does is if you go the other way

2472
01:46:04,250 --> 01:46:05,083
on the way home and on the way home we 
were the farthest point in Australia so 

2473
01:46:11,751 --> 01:46:14,840
the flight in Australia was like six 
hours.

2474
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:18,140
So from the time the time I texted my 
mom,

2475
01:46:18,170 --> 01:46:19,003
mom,
I'm leaving to come home to 

2476
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:23,090
Philadelphia.
I got home 36 hours later.

2477
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:25,950
Oh.

2478
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:26,903
So they,
they offer me constantly to come back 

2479
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:32,000
and,
and you know what we do for a living?

2480
01:46:32,030 --> 01:46:37,030
We would go places and I'm like Yo man,
that flight nervous breakdown.

2481
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:42,840
You have to decide what's more important
money or your mental stability.

2482
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:43,713
Yeah.
And I'm already Nadia Than Squirrel 

2483
01:46:45,630 --> 01:46:46,590
Shit.
So I don't need,

2484
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:50,100
I don't need anything to push me any 
further than

2485
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:52,860
it's already what's going on in between 
my ears.

2486
01:46:52,890 --> 01:46:57,810
Thailand is a similar thing.
It's like 14 and then another five.

2487
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:02,940
I think it was like 11 to go to Europe 
or where did we go?

2488
01:47:02,941 --> 01:47:07,941
I think we went to Taiwan first and then
it was another like five or something or

2489
01:47:11,060 --> 01:47:13,380
when.
By the time you're back,

2490
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:16,290
you're so confused.
It took me two solid weeks for.

2491
01:47:16,291 --> 01:47:18,660
I started sleeping at night again.
I think it took me three.

2492
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:23,040
I'd wake up like two hours later.
I go to bed tired as fuck.

2493
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,140
Wake up two hours later,
wide awake.

2494
01:47:25,141 --> 01:47:26,400
It was two in the morning.
I'm like,

2495
01:47:26,401 --> 01:47:31,320
what is this?
Your whole Circadian Rhythms Jot fucked.

2496
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:32,940
It takes forever to get back.
Yeah,

2497
01:47:32,941 --> 01:47:34,320
man,
it took me two or three weeks.

2498
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:36,570
Two and I,
we fucked up my family.

2499
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:39,870
We did two trips in the summer.
We went to Thailand and then we took two

2500
01:47:39,871 --> 01:47:40,330
weeks off.

2501
01:47:40,330 --> 01:47:42,580
Then we went to Italy,
so it was just a,

2502
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:45,750
a double bunker.
So was it enough for you to be like,

2503
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:47,440
I'm not going back?
No,

2504
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:48,613
no.
I like it.

2505
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:51,190
I've learned how to travel.
I blog.

2506
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:52,133
I really like taking my kids places too.
I really liked the fact that I like to 

2507
01:47:55,651 --> 01:48:00,651
expose them to places like Thailand and 
Italy and take them to different places.

2508
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:02,364
I like.
I like exposing them to Costa Rica and 

2509
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:06,960
we didn't get to do that.
Yeah.

2510
01:48:06,961 --> 01:48:09,960
So the fact that you have the ability to
do that,

2511
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:12,540
it's beautiful for them.
You know that that's a lot.

2512
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:15,000
That's cool shit to say that they did 
that.

2513
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:20,170
I'm enjoying it more than I ever thought
I would be an apparent to me is it's not

2514
01:48:20,311 --> 01:48:21,144
just a,
a beautiful thing to watch these little 

2515
01:48:23,221 --> 01:48:25,860
people that I love so much,
grow and have fun and be happy,

2516
01:48:26,130 --> 01:48:26,963
but it's also um,
I'm getting to experience the world 

2517
01:48:28,741 --> 01:48:29,520
through their eyes.

2518
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:30,780
Watch them,
ride an elephant.

2519
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:32,470
Thailand,
watched them,

2520
01:48:32,780 --> 01:48:33,613
watch them,
a zip line with me and Costa Rica were 

2521
01:48:35,731 --> 01:48:38,610
laughing together on the heavy chain.
It's intense,

2522
01:48:38,611 --> 01:48:40,290
man.
It really is.

2523
01:48:40,310 --> 01:48:41,340
It's,
it tends to,

2524
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:42,253
it's,
it's made me shift my values and shift 

2525
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:47,820
how I think about just experiencing 
things.

2526
01:48:47,821 --> 01:48:49,470
Yeah.
It's a heavy thing,

2527
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:50,130
man.
They change.

2528
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:53,520
They change you in ways you didn't think
were possible.

2529
01:48:53,521 --> 01:48:54,470
Yeah.
You know,

2530
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,690
empathy and not just.
But like you said,

2531
01:48:57,691 --> 01:49:00,750
seeing things through their eyes.
That's like the coolest thing,

2532
01:49:00,751 --> 01:49:02,190
you know what I mean?
Because we didn't have that.

2533
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:03,120
Yeah,
it's weird.

2534
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:07,080
It's weird man.
So it makes me feel super vulnerable to,

2535
01:49:07,170 --> 01:49:08,820
you know,
like you were talking about your mom,

2536
01:49:09,060 --> 01:49:12,120
like worrying about your mom,
worried about people that you care,

2537
01:49:12,121 --> 01:49:14,580
but it's one of the things,
it's like a catch 22.

2538
01:49:14,581 --> 01:49:17,220
It's like if you're on your own,
you don't have to worry about nobody.

2539
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:20,130
You don't give a fuck about nothing,
but you also don't have anything.

2540
01:49:20,190 --> 01:49:21,023
Right?
So when you have all these people that 

2541
01:49:22,201 --> 01:49:24,750
you love and you care about so much,
then you worry about losing them.

2542
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,060
It's,
it's a double edged sword.

2543
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,240
Having,
when I was alone,

2544
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:31,074
just wilding.
It's like I was behaving that way 

2545
01:49:33,241 --> 01:49:34,074
because I had nothing.
So you're looking for something then 

2546
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:36,984
yeah,
find it and all you do is worry about 

2547
01:49:38,311 --> 01:49:39,144
losing.
It goes back to what we were talking 

2548
01:49:41,371 --> 01:49:44,280
about earlier,
like if you're not scared a little,

2549
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:46,770
if you're not nervous a little,
if you're not,

2550
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:48,100
if you don't get a little

2551
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:50,410
bit of anxiety when you're not paying 
attention,

2552
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:53,860
but you're not living your life,
you're not seeing anything,

2553
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:56,980
you're getting yourself out there.
If you're putting yourself out there,

2554
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:59,380
you're going to have some anxiety.
You're going to have some fear.

2555
01:49:59,381 --> 01:50:02,080
You're going to have some worries with 
those people that don't have,

2556
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:02,914
that don't put themselves out.
Is that I live in a bubble and they're 

2557
01:50:04,721 --> 01:50:07,990
comfortable and a gray and dry.
Yes.

2558
01:50:07,991 --> 01:50:10,420
It's that niche,
that Nietzsche question.

2559
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:11,254
Would you rather live your life in a 
series of tremendous highs and 

2560
01:50:13,511 --> 01:50:16,870
tremendous lows or just flat line,
flat line,

2561
01:50:16,871 --> 01:50:20,050
and these people think flatlining that 
square life is like,

2562
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,340
oh,
you know,

2563
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:23,560
two point five kids and a house like 
this.

2564
01:50:23,561 --> 01:50:24,311
Is it like,
no,

2565
01:50:24,311 --> 01:50:25,144
that's not it,
man.

2566
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:26,190
It's not.
I mean,

2567
01:50:26,200 --> 01:50:28,180
there's nothing wrong with having two 
point five kids in the house,

2568
01:50:28,181 --> 01:50:30,320
but go do some shit and no kids.

2569
01:50:30,650 --> 01:50:32,470
That's what I meant.
Go to the woods.

2570
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:35,080
Go rafting short.
Yeah.

2571
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:36,520
Get get something done,
man.

2572
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:39,490
We went whitewater rafting last year in 
Montana.

2573
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:42,810
That was shit,
man.

2574
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:43,923
Glacier river,
fucking freezing cold water bears 

2575
01:50:46,931 --> 01:50:49,300
everywhere and it's nuts,
man.

2576
01:50:49,340 --> 01:50:50,173
Wow.
Going rafting down the river and seeing 

2577
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:55,450
trout jumping.
It's like,

2578
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:58,690
just get into the mix to see them 
experience shit.

2579
01:50:58,691 --> 01:51:01,120
Like we took them to yellowstone,
they got to see Bison,

2580
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:02,263
you know,
wild bison up close to their minds are 

2581
01:51:04,091 --> 01:51:04,924
just blown by it.
I just want them to see as much shit as 

2582
01:51:06,671 --> 01:51:09,070
I can show them.
I want them to see.

2583
01:51:09,071 --> 01:51:09,904
I mean,
I'm going to like every few months my 

2584
01:51:12,371 --> 01:51:14,620
wife and I sit down and talk like,
what are we going to do this summer?

2585
01:51:14,650 --> 01:51:16,870
Like where are we going to take?
Like this year was Thailand,

2586
01:51:16,871 --> 01:51:18,850
where are we going to go next year?
Take them somewhere else.

2587
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:19,870
Weird.
God bless.

2588
01:51:19,970 --> 01:51:21,190
Yeah.
It's fun man.

2589
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,950
It's fascinating.
It's um,

2590
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,740
it's a weird life,
uh,

2591
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:31,390
education that I didn't anticipate.
Of course you build it,

2592
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:32,224
man.
You deserve it because you did it your 

2593
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:36,364
way.
And that's punk rock and punk rock as 

2594
01:51:38,561 --> 01:51:39,700
fuck.
That's funny.

2595
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:42,880
Yeah.
When you're traveling,

2596
01:51:43,240 --> 01:51:46,660
how many guys you bring them with you?
It's usually,

2597
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:49,510
um,
so there's three of us on stage.

2598
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:50,553
Like me rhyming,
a hype man and a Dj and then a tour 

2599
01:51:52,691 --> 01:51:57,340
manager and emerge guy.
So usually five.

2600
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:01,210
That's a good thing because comics,
a lot of times travel by themselves.

2601
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:03,980
They get the press.
I know,

2602
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:06,730
I know like already we'll talk about it 
a lot.

2603
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:12,220
Just being alone in a hotel room and 
fucking Schenectady.

2604
01:52:12,670 --> 01:52:14,980
I figured that shit out a long time ago 
though.

2605
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:16,023
I started bringing my friends with me 
because in promoters or clubs they 

2606
01:52:19,571 --> 01:52:21,460
wouldn't pay for the friend you wouldn't
pay,

2607
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,080
wouldn't pay for.
So I would just say,

2608
01:52:23,081 --> 01:52:24,970
look,
give me a flat rate.

2609
01:52:25,060 --> 01:52:27,400
I'll pay my opening act.
I'll pay their airfare,

2610
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:29,410
I'll pay their hotel.
I'd rather lose money.

2611
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:34,560
Well my earlier tours I was the 
promoters didn't care about opening acts

2612
01:52:35,051 --> 01:52:37,840
and I was paying my homeboys to be the 
opening acts.

2613
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:40,810
Just like kind of my what?
I was getting paid.

2614
01:52:40,811 --> 01:52:43,510
I was handing it to them.
The same thing.

2615
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:46,070
User experience because you're keeping 
yourself safe

2616
01:52:46,140 --> 01:52:48,470
and you have family in the road.
Like when I go on the road,

2617
01:52:48,471 --> 01:52:51,620
if I go on the road with Joey or Aria 
and those guys were family.

2618
01:52:51,950 --> 01:52:52,783
Tony,
we're having a good time wherever we 

2619
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:56,000
are.
Like what time you guys want to eat?

2620
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:57,740
Let's eat lunch at noon.
Okay.

2621
01:52:57,741 --> 01:52:59,990
I'll meet you guys down there.
And so you guys want to go to the gym?

2622
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:00,824
All right,
let's go hit the gym.

2623
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:03,370
So we're laughing and having a good 
time.

2624
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:06,380
But in the early days I did a lot of 
those solo trips.

2625
01:53:06,410 --> 01:53:09,040
There's a weird empty feeling.
You have your urban.

2626
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:10,940
That's a very dark.
I mean,

2627
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:16,750
did you see that Louis episode that he 
did about traveling and he's alone?

2628
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:20,000
It's a whole episode dedicated to what 
you just said.

2629
01:53:20,410 --> 01:53:23,180
And it was very dark.
It was not humorous.

2630
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:26,720
You got to take friends with you.
I have friends to this day that don't do

2631
01:53:26,721 --> 01:53:27,230
it that way.

2632
01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:29,540
They go on,
they use local acts and I'm like,

2633
01:53:29,541 --> 01:53:30,610
man,
don't do it with A.

2634
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:31,753
Yeah.
But then I'd have to pay for his air 

2635
01:53:32,591 --> 01:53:34,900
fare.
I'm like paid them money or man,

2636
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,430
I know you're going to make less money 
that way,

2637
01:53:37,431 --> 01:53:39,410
but you'll feel better.
You have to,

2638
01:53:39,710 --> 01:53:44,710
there comes a time where those decisions
where you're doing things monetarily,

2639
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:47,203
uh,
they were making this decision based on 

2640
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:53,510
financial and you have to worry about 
your mental stability more.

2641
01:53:54,050 --> 01:53:56,870
Whatever the opener with Gat,
if it's $500 grand,

2642
01:53:56,871 --> 01:53:57,990
three grand,
$5,

2643
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,580
whatever it is that's worth having 
family with you,

2644
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:04,280
and not only that,
I feel like your performance is going to

2645
01:54:04,281 --> 01:54:05,114
be better or worse because you're going 
to be with friends or going to have a 

2646
01:54:06,831 --> 01:54:08,900
good time.
You're not worried about the show.

2647
01:54:08,901 --> 01:54:10,700
You bring a funny guy to open up for 
you.

2648
01:54:10,701 --> 01:54:11,534
You know he's good.

2649
01:54:11,570 --> 01:54:12,403
Yeah.
Yeah,

2650
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:15,050
and then so then more people will come 
to your next show.

2651
01:54:15,051 --> 01:54:17,030
It's like,
it's better for you financially.

2652
01:54:17,450 --> 01:54:20,600
It's a short term investment or for 
longterm gain.

2653
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:21,590
Of course,
of course.

2654
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,290
That's what these people think.
They're penny wise and pound foolish.

2655
01:54:24,650 --> 01:54:25,483
You know what I mean?
They don't understand that when what 

2656
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:27,943
you're doing,
everyone's going to kill and then it's 

2657
01:54:30,621 --> 01:54:31,454
going to be double the people next door.
At least everybody's gonna have a good 

2658
01:54:34,551 --> 01:54:36,830
time and you're not gonna get out of 
there crazy.

2659
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:39,680
When I come back Sunday morning,
I might be tired,

2660
01:54:40,010 --> 01:54:41,680
but at least I had a good time.
Sure.

2661
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:42,613
I'm not.
I don't feel like I'm going to fucking 

2662
01:54:43,671 --> 01:54:44,890
shoot myself.
Absolutely.

2663
01:54:45,310 --> 01:54:48,080
Yeah.
That's the real problem with travel.

2664
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:49,560
It's fucking depressing.
You know,

2665
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:52,080
one of the things I read about,
um,

2666
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:53,323
an interview with bordain after he died,
I started reading a bunch of shit that 

2667
01:54:56,751 --> 01:54:58,540
he had decided.

2668
01:54:58,550 --> 01:55:00,710
It blindsided me.
I didn't see it coming.

2669
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:04,940
And then after he died I read a bunch of
his stuff where he was talking about how

2670
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:06,103
intensely lonely it was when he was 
traveling and I knew he'd traveled with 

2671
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:11,120
people that he cared about,
you know,

2672
01:55:11,121 --> 01:55:11,954
he traveled with people that he liked,
but I think just traveling 250 days a 

2673
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:18,080
year period will fuck you up.
Absolutely.

2674
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:18,600
I,
I,

2675
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:22,130
I can't say that bit at people being 
with me.

2676
01:55:22,131 --> 01:55:24,620
I still don't feel lonely because 
there's something,

2677
01:55:24,680 --> 01:55:28,220
there's a connection to home that once I
separate from that,

2678
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:31,010
from home,
from Philly for my mom,

2679
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:32,390
you know,
all of that.

2680
01:55:32,391 --> 01:55:36,290
Once,
once I'm separated from that reality,

2681
01:55:37,010 --> 01:55:37,843
it,
I love having my friends around me and 

2682
01:55:39,381 --> 01:55:41,150
it makes it better,
but it doesn't fix it.

2683
01:55:41,300 --> 01:55:42,950
Yeah.
There's still the sense,

2684
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:44,550
um,
I'm out here alone.

2685
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:46,730
There's still um,
and,

2686
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,300
and I don't,
I don't,

2687
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:52,440
I can't make any sense out of that 
because I'm technically not alone.

2688
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:54,070
So it's not.
Yeah,

2689
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:55,950
it doesn't make much sense.
Not home though.

2690
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:56,813
Right.
I read something where you were saying 

2691
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:01,210
that this might be your last tour.
I'm just,

2692
01:56:01,620 --> 01:56:02,910
I don't know man.
It's,

2693
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:04,490
it's common.
Yeah.

2694
01:56:04,810 --> 01:56:05,610
Hold,
you know,

2695
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:06,443
four.
I'll be 41 in October fifth and he just 

2696
01:56:09,451 --> 01:56:13,890
getting tired of it or ain't me man,
forget the physical training.

2697
01:56:13,930 --> 01:56:18,270
My spirit.
It's the anxiety before I'm leaving.

2698
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:21,810
Is,
is a say you get nervous like three days

2699
01:56:21,811 --> 01:56:24,900
before you leaving now it's starting 
like two months before I'm leaving.

2700
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:26,310
Really?
Yeah.

2701
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:29,160
Just when you go out,
how long do you go out for a.

2702
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:31,740
that's changed too.
I mean I would go out for six weeks,

2703
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:34,020
42 shows in a row before,
you know,

2704
01:56:34,021 --> 01:56:34,854
before now I got like two,
two and a half weeks and me then I'll 

2705
01:56:38,401 --> 01:56:39,870
come home.
Then I got like when I,

2706
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:42,300
when I come back from Cali and I go to 
Europe,

2707
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:43,790
you know?

2708
01:56:43,790 --> 01:56:45,660
Um,
but you know,

2709
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:47,220
again,
like to say last tour,

2710
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:50,010
it's like I don't want to fucking turn 
into gene simmons whereas,

2711
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:52,350
you know what I'm saying where it's 
like,

2712
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:53,790
this is it.
So come see me.

2713
01:56:53,791 --> 01:56:56,600
You're never gonna see me again.
Like I'm not doing the 19 eighties.

2714
01:56:56,610 --> 01:56:58,700
They did that at 83 or something,
you know,

2715
01:56:59,310 --> 01:57:01,190
I don't want to do that.
So I don't,

2716
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:05,220
it's why I chose my words properly where
it was more like,

2717
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:07,950
you know,
I'm getting run down and it's,

2718
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:09,170
you know,
traveling is,

2719
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:10,133
is,
uh,

2720
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:12,630
it's a,
again,

2721
01:57:12,631 --> 01:57:13,464
it's no different than you.
It's beautiful being up on stage when 

2722
01:57:15,511 --> 01:57:16,650
people are laughing,
you know,

2723
01:57:16,651 --> 01:57:19,110
but getting there,
the flights,

2724
01:57:19,170 --> 01:57:20,220
the,
this,

2725
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:21,083
the,
that,

2726
01:57:21,090 --> 01:57:22,620
the hotels,
it's just,

2727
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,000
I don't,
you know,

2728
01:57:24,001 --> 01:57:24,834
it's something that you could never 
explain to someone who doesn't do it 

2729
01:57:26,641 --> 01:57:28,050
and,
and why exactly.

2730
01:57:28,051 --> 01:57:32,520
You're tired still when you walk out on 
stage and Germany or some shit goes away

2731
01:57:32,521 --> 01:57:33,600
and everybody goes crazy.

2732
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:36,900
It all goes away.
It's still a side of the planet,

2733
01:57:36,901 --> 01:57:38,380
other side of the planet.
It's still,

2734
01:57:38,410 --> 01:57:41,280
it's still the most humbling thing in 
the world because it's still in my head,

2735
01:57:41,281 --> 01:57:41,551
like,
no,

2736
01:57:41,551 --> 01:57:42,740
I'm a kid from Philly,
you know,

2737
01:57:42,741 --> 01:57:45,150
like it was rhyming on street corners,
gentlemen,

2738
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:46,290
Finny Past.
Yeah.

2739
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,830
That could never.
It's crazy.

2740
01:57:49,860 --> 01:57:51,570
Never not feel great.
You know,

2741
01:57:51,870 --> 01:57:52,703
it's um,
I almost feel bad for people that will 

2742
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:55,230
never experience it.
I sure.

2743
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:59,370
Sure.
It's a mind fuck of unreal.

2744
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:01,730
It's like pinch yourself shit.
Yeah.

2745
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:02,671
You know,
he was like,

2746
01:58:02,671 --> 01:58:03,800
well,
we'll have a fuck.

2747
01:58:03,810 --> 01:58:05,910
Did they?
Sometimes you got to step back.

2748
01:58:05,940 --> 01:58:06,773
You know,
I don't think as people we do that 

2749
01:58:07,771 --> 01:58:08,980
enough,
you know,

2750
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:09,833
because we were living in the moment,
like even right now it's like I've been 

2751
01:58:13,741 --> 01:58:14,574
a fan of yours for a very long time and 
just to have this convo with you is 

2752
01:58:19,141 --> 01:58:24,141
beautiful and it's going to be a mind 
fuck later after I think about it.

2753
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:26,103
Right.
You know what I mean?

2754
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:28,410
We was talking like old friends now,
you know what I mean?

2755
01:58:28,411 --> 01:58:31,530
But it's like for I've been following 
your whole career,

2756
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:32,520
you know what I mean?
So,

2757
01:58:32,521 --> 01:58:34,730
and it had been a fan your whole career.
So it's,

2758
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,080
I still get weirded out when I meet 
people,

2759
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:39,433
of course,
knowing someone for a long time for 

2760
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:41,603
watching stuff or listening to this 
stuff and then you're right in front of 

2761
01:58:44,141 --> 01:58:44,381
him.
Like,

2762
01:58:44,381 --> 01:58:45,214
hey man.
He like I became friends with Bill 

2763
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:50,770
Paxton because he like was like,
can I would kind come to the show.

2764
01:58:50,771 --> 01:58:52,600
I'm a fan or why?
That guy was great.

2765
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:55,600
He was the best.
He doesn't know what I loved him in.

2766
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:58,990
Remember that vampire movie?
Oh Shit the fuck was that movie?

2767
01:58:59,190 --> 01:59:02,200
I remember what that was called.
God Damn it.

2768
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:05,170
Did you see the Shitty,
the rounded frailty?

2769
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:07,070
I did see that.
That was good.

2770
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:08,520
That was very good.
Yeah,

2771
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:10,420
it was creepy.
Very creepy.

2772
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,970
Yeah.
What the fuck was that fan power movie.

2773
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,690
Jamie's got it.
What do you.

2774
01:59:14,920 --> 01:59:15,760
What is it?
Jamie?

2775
01:59:16,090 --> 01:59:17,950
Near dark.
That was a great.

2776
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:21,520
That's one of the best vampire movies 
ever.

2777
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:25,150
And one of the ones that people forgot 
about Jamie's like,

2778
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:27,760
Yo,
this motherfucker wizard.

2779
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:28,753
Oh man,
he's not even finished sentences and 

2780
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:33,940
shits on the boys to what?
We've been working together a long time.

2781
01:59:33,941 --> 01:59:35,590
It's telepathic.
That's what's going on.

2782
01:59:35,591 --> 01:59:39,810
I can tell you how much respect man.
Paxton was in a gang.

2783
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:40,780
Good movies.
Yeah,

2784
01:59:40,781 --> 01:59:42,670
man.
He was a great pro chat.

2785
01:59:42,990 --> 01:59:44,140
Yeah,
you're stupid.

2786
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:45,820
But wide.
Yeah.

2787
01:59:46,420 --> 01:59:48,430
Aliens,
aliens.

2788
01:59:48,431 --> 01:59:51,070
The second alien member.
He's in the first scene of terminator.

2789
01:59:51,071 --> 01:59:53,490
He's the punk.
Rock is closed.

2790
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:55,390
That's right.
Yeah.

2791
01:59:55,450 --> 01:59:56,420
Yeah,
man.

2792
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:58,230
Talented guy.
Very sad man.

2793
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:01,420
That guy went on fucking good morning 
America.

2794
02:00:01,421 --> 02:00:02,171
Yeah,
it went on.

2795
02:00:02,171 --> 02:00:03,004
Good morning.
America and pick me up to like Kathie 

2796
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,390
Lee really was like,
I heard you're a hip hop fan.

2797
02:00:07,391 --> 02:00:07,841
He's like,
yeah,

2798
02:00:07,841 --> 02:00:11,080
Jedi mind tricks.
You want to talk about?

2799
02:00:11,081 --> 02:00:12,420
What the fuck?
You know what I mean?

2800
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:14,313
I got like one sock on my hair sticking 
up and saying my name on Good Morning 

2801
02:00:19,610 --> 02:00:20,920
America.
How old was he when he died?

2802
02:00:21,640 --> 02:00:23,710
He was only like 60 something.
Yeah man.

2803
02:00:23,711 --> 02:00:25,570
He was young.
He died of a stroke.

2804
02:00:25,630 --> 02:00:28,390
He was young and man and not a dude who 
like,

2805
02:00:28,391 --> 02:00:31,390
he was in good shape and you know,
lived well.

2806
02:00:32,380 --> 02:00:36,700
Six 62.
FARC stroke,

2807
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:40,510
Jesus Christ.
They had a young son,

2808
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:41,890
has a young son,
you know,

2809
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:44,040
very young.
It's only 21 now.

2810
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:45,050
Twenty two,
you know,

2811
02:00:45,051 --> 02:00:46,760
so that's.
Yeah.

2812
02:00:47,110 --> 02:00:47,980
You never know,
man.

2813
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:49,930
You do never know.
You know,

2814
02:00:50,380 --> 02:00:51,640
that's a hard life to men.

2815
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:54,180
That movie star life.
Maybe a little poor baby.

2816
02:00:54,210 --> 02:00:58,000
Two movies,
but those days are rough man.

2817
02:00:58,001 --> 02:00:59,620
Sixteen hours,
eight to 16,

2818
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:04,150
18 hours standing around waiting and 
then you got to do it again the next day

2819
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:06,010
and you're working six,
seven days a week.

2820
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:09,880
Rarely do you have a day off because 
their budget is only a certain amount.

2821
02:01:09,881 --> 02:01:13,840
They get smashing all the 42 days in a 
row or something.

2822
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:15,033
Everybody's on.
Everybody's nerves are on top of people 

2823
02:01:16,781 --> 02:01:20,770
and it's stressful tense.
You ever hear the Christian Bale ran the

2824
02:01:21,490 --> 02:01:23,410
sound guy or the lighting guy was in his
way.

2825
02:01:23,411 --> 02:01:27,220
You're fucking amateur man.
Losing loses his shit.

2826
02:01:27,221 --> 02:01:29,770
Yeah.
Well he's an intense guy,

2827
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:32,470
brilliant actor.
He's a.

2828
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:35,580
he's one of those almost die for a park 
guys.

2829
02:01:35,590 --> 02:01:36,423
Definitely.
When he did the Dicky Eklund and Micky 

2830
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,040
Ward,
shit,

2831
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:39,980
he almost died.

2832
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:41,413
He.
That was the second time you did that 

2833
02:01:42,770 --> 02:01:44,390
mechanic,
machinist,

2834
02:01:44,450 --> 02:01:45,420
machinist,
mechanic.

2835
02:01:45,450 --> 02:01:48,200
Shit is brilliant.
That's not even a good movie.

2836
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:49,850
That's not a problem,
it's just the hardest thing.

2837
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:54,830
It's just the hardest thing.
Seeing him literally on death's door.

2838
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:56,203
That's the brilliance and yeah,
I just don't understand people that are 

2839
02:01:58,431 --> 02:02:01,910
willing to do that and just do something
else.

2840
02:02:02,360 --> 02:02:03,193
I'm not willing to do anything.
He only stopped a role where you don't 

2841
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:07,830
have to starve yourself.
Yeah.

2842
02:02:08,060 --> 02:02:11,300
You had to have another script in front 
of you that day and it was.

2843
02:02:11,420 --> 02:02:12,253
That's the thing is like do that movie 
and all that movie is known for is the 

2844
02:02:16,131 --> 02:02:19,100
fact that you almost died.
That's it.

2845
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,680
Nobody's like,
man,

2846
02:02:21,681 --> 02:02:23,660
the machinists was like,
like when?

2847
02:02:24,410 --> 02:02:28,480
When Robert Deniro gained a shitload of 
weight for raging bull,

2848
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:29,661
you know,
he,

2849
02:02:29,661 --> 02:02:34,550
he got in fantastic shape play.
Jake Lamata was ripped and then gained a

2850
02:02:34,551 --> 02:02:35,730
fuck load of weight.

2851
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,380
Jake,
because he was older,

2852
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:39,110
like you go,
wow,

2853
02:02:39,111 --> 02:02:42,980
that's some serious goddamn commitment 
and it's one of the best movies ever.

2854
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:44,060
Yeah,
that's the thing.

2855
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:46,790
It's one of the best movies ever,
but if you do that,

2856
02:02:46,830 --> 02:02:47,663
like,
like charlene the Ron did that when she 

2857
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:51,753
knows.
Yeah.

2858
02:02:51,770 --> 02:02:52,603
Yeah.
That was another one and that was even 

2859
02:02:53,931 --> 02:02:55,890
more bulk.
She's a beautiful watch.

2860
02:02:55,950 --> 02:02:56,783
Yeah.
So for her to get fat and disgusting 

2861
02:02:57,951 --> 02:02:59,850
like that was like wow.
Yeah.

2862
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:01,580
And I'm always great.
It was a great movie.

2863
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:02,660
It won the Oscar,
right?

2864
02:03:02,720 --> 02:03:04,340
Or she did.
Yeah.

2865
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:05,960
Uh,
I think,

2866
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:06,990
yeah,
she got gross.

2867
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:09,290
Yeah.
That's a horror movie.

2868
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:11,990
My friend Patty wrote and directed the.
Oh really?

2869
02:03:11,991 --> 02:03:12,621
Yeah.
Wow.

2870
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:15,400
The Jenkins in the house.
That's crazy.

2871
02:03:15,410 --> 02:03:18,070
We think about how fucking smoking hot 
she is.

2872
02:03:18,071 --> 02:03:18,620
Yeah,
man.

2873
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:20,620
She got girl rose.
Got rid of her eyebrows,

2874
02:03:20,660 --> 02:03:23,300
eyelashes or eyebrows.
Everything.

2875
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:24,470
Look at it with that Oscar.

2876
02:03:24,500 --> 02:03:25,850
Ooh.
St Person Hollow.

2877
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:29,840
She makes you think all those chubby 
gross ladies.

2878
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:31,670
Maybe just,
maybe they just need a little,

2879
02:03:32,050 --> 02:03:36,730
a little motivation look like charlene.
Yeah.

2880
02:03:37,450 --> 02:03:40,340
It's a,
it's a tough craft that acting,

2881
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:41,670
you know,
it's um,

2882
02:03:41,930 --> 02:03:44,890
it's one of those jobs where,
you know,

2883
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:47,180
everybody wants to do it,
but very few people can.

2884
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:48,283
And when you do do it,
it's such an unbelievably grueling 

2885
02:03:53,271 --> 02:03:55,850
grind.
You can only do it for so long.

2886
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:57,680
And if you're a woman,
man,

2887
02:03:57,681 --> 02:04:01,230
you gotta just a few years in your 
window is very short,

2888
02:04:01,640 --> 02:04:03,030
especially if you're a hot woman.
Yeah.

2889
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:04,033
There's a gang of those 22 year old 
cupcakes coming up trying to take your 

2890
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:07,950
spot.
Absolutely.

2891
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:10,880
Just as crazy as you.
They can cry on cue and they will always

2892
02:04:10,881 --> 02:04:12,200
be coming up.
Always.

2893
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:13,250
Always,
always,

2894
02:04:13,251 --> 02:04:15,320
always bad parents out there making good
actors.

2895
02:04:15,321 --> 02:04:16,154
Absolutely making bad parental decisions
and sending their kids to Hollywood 

2896
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:22,970
being that's what it is here.
There's a flood of.

2897
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,800
I mean,
how often do you spend time out here?

2898
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:26,720
Pretty often.
A couple times a year.

2899
02:04:26,721 --> 02:04:28,490
I have a lot of like close friends out 
here.

2900
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,650
It's just a strange place.
Bizarro world.

2901
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:35,240
And,
and like Philly is not a show Biz hub?

2902
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:37,210
No,
but there's a lot of great showbiz.

2903
02:04:37,230 --> 02:04:38,063
Kevin Hart,

2904
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,100
great bands.
Music,

2905
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:42,150
of course.
Great stuff comes from philly.

2906
02:04:42,151 --> 02:04:44,230
Yeah.
But it's not a showbiz has not.

2907
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:46,350
It's not.
I mean we're 90 miles from New York,

2908
02:04:46,351 --> 02:04:47,490
so that's like,
you know,

2909
02:04:47,530 --> 02:04:50,120
but not close enough.
But this is a show.

2910
02:04:50,121 --> 02:04:53,070
Biz Hub of course,
attracts all the weird everywhere.

2911
02:04:53,071 --> 02:04:55,170
I mean,
every weight is an aspiring actor,

2912
02:04:55,630 --> 02:04:56,463
bartender,
bartenders that I still through all the 

2913
02:04:59,401 --> 02:05:01,620
times I've been coming here.
Can't wrap my head around that.

2914
02:05:01,660 --> 02:05:03,450
Like that.
Everyone's in inspiring somebody.

2915
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:04,600
One one.
Yeah.

2916
02:05:04,920 --> 02:05:06,930
That's what it is.
Throw place.

2917
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:08,280
Well,
the other thing is you get to know,

2918
02:05:08,281 --> 02:05:10,920
like I get to know people when they have
kids.

2919
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:14,630
Your kids become friends with their kids
and then you meet the pain.

2920
02:05:14,631 --> 02:05:17,310
You think the parents are normal and it 
turns out now,

2921
02:05:17,630 --> 02:05:18,463
you know,
there were actors that gave it up and 

2922
02:05:20,390 --> 02:05:24,870
sells fucking computers or whatever.
It's like everyone had this dream.

2923
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:26,260
Absolutely come out here.
It's,

2924
02:05:26,490 --> 02:05:27,630
I think if you,
if you,

2925
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:29,783
if you just took into account all 
showbiz aspirations in southern 

2926
02:05:32,881 --> 02:05:34,290
California,
saw it on a map,

2927
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:35,453
like a little red light would go off 
wherever the show biz aspirations where 

2928
02:05:39,030 --> 02:05:41,130
it'd be overwhelming.
It would be.

2929
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:44,940
Whereas in places like Philly or Boston 
where I'm from,

2930
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:46,980
you don't see much.
It's not.

2931
02:05:47,130 --> 02:05:50,580
Nah,
not anyone with anyone with aspirations.

2932
02:05:50,581 --> 02:05:52,350
It's sort of self contained.
Yeah.

2933
02:05:52,351 --> 02:05:53,050
You know,
and they,

2934
02:05:53,050 --> 02:05:56,160
they do what's necessary.
But you know,

2935
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,710
it's uh,
it's just,

2936
02:05:58,830 --> 02:05:59,663
I've always been intrigued because La 
and New York are those places where 

2937
02:06:03,991 --> 02:06:07,080
everyone you ask is from there,
you know what I mean?

2938
02:06:07,081 --> 02:06:07,830
Like,
no,

2939
02:06:07,830 --> 02:06:08,663
no,
the girl walking down the street and 

2940
02:06:09,661 --> 02:06:11,990
Manhattan is from Iowa,
right.

2941
02:06:12,120 --> 02:06:14,490
She wants to be a model or whatever.
And it's like,

2942
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:15,780
same thing out here,
like,

2943
02:06:15,781 --> 02:06:16,320
oh,
I'm from,

2944
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,300
you know,
from where,

2945
02:06:17,350 --> 02:06:18,340
like nobody's from here.

2946
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:21,930
Well not nobody but very few.
Very few.

2947
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:24,680
It's a total transient city.
You know,

2948
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:27,870
in New York is a weird one too because 
whenever I'm in New York I go,

2949
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:29,070
I look at all these people go,
okay,

2950
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:29,933
how do you afford this?
I just see a small walking down the 

2951
02:06:33,841 --> 02:06:34,661
street and I'm like,
Yo,

2952
02:06:34,661 --> 02:06:37,500
a closet here is like five grand a month
and you just look.

2953
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:41,070
It looks like you just walked out of a 
shoe or like a chug.

2954
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:43,410
I don't understand it.
I don't either.

2955
02:06:43,530 --> 02:06:44,363
And I've talked to people that lived 
there in the nineties and it's still 

2956
02:06:46,771 --> 02:06:47,604
live there today.
They're like New York City used to be a 

2957
02:06:49,351 --> 02:06:52,500
lot of artists and a lot of like weird 
people.

2958
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:56,370
Especially downtown now.
It's all finance people.

2959
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,233
It's just so gentrified.
It doesn't look like the New York that 

2960
02:06:59,461 --> 02:06:59,941
we,
you know,

2961
02:06:59,941 --> 02:07:02,040
we used to centrify to fund name for 
white people.

2962
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:02,680
Right?
It is,

2963
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:03,490
that's what it is.
Right.

2964
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:05,740
It's sure it's happening in philly too.
Why is that?

2965
02:07:05,750 --> 02:07:06,583
Yeah.
Why these bum Russia and places that I 

2966
02:07:08,401 --> 02:07:10,860
used to hang out with,
you had to speak Spanish to be there and

2967
02:07:10,861 --> 02:07:14,130
it was the hood and now it's like white 
people walking.

2968
02:07:14,400 --> 02:07:19,130
They looked like they were in weezer 
walking little like it's fucking hard to

2969
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,910
murder scene.
Well that's a weird thing.

2970
02:07:20,911 --> 02:07:21,744
Like DC has that to dcs weird in that 
the hood and the gentrified 

2971
02:07:26,551 --> 02:07:27,384
neighborhoods are like a block away from
Philly is and these motherfuckers are 

2972
02:07:30,751 --> 02:07:35,751
going to walk one block or the wrong way
and be fucking beheaded by luck.

2973
02:07:37,690 --> 02:07:39,280
Have at it man.
I guess you know,

2974
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:40,743
how does that work?
It's just people go there for like some 

2975
02:07:43,841 --> 02:07:46,750
sort of a professional gig and they run 
out of real estate,

2976
02:07:46,751 --> 02:07:48,130
so they just start redoing houses.

2977
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:48,821
Yeah,
man.

2978
02:07:48,821 --> 02:07:49,654
It's like,
it's basically like glorified slum Lord 

2979
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:53,290
Shit.
Like you know,

2980
02:07:53,330 --> 02:07:54,370
and,
and you can't,

2981
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:55,533
you can't displace poor people.
It's not like they just disappear like 

2982
02:07:58,331 --> 02:08:00,310
everyone's got to go somewhere.
You know what I mean?

2983
02:08:00,311 --> 02:08:02,620
So you're just like,
you're basically paying,

2984
02:08:02,650 --> 02:08:06,010
playing tetris with humans.
Like moving.

2985
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:09,370
This was one of the worst hoods in 
Philly and now it's Bougie.

2986
02:08:09,870 --> 02:08:12,490
Is that really happening?
Absolutely man.

2987
02:08:12,491 --> 02:08:13,324
Absolutely.
Like the only city more gentrified than 

2988
02:08:15,671 --> 02:08:18,880
New York is Philadelphia in my epic.
That's happening in Brownsville,

2989
02:08:18,881 --> 02:08:19,581
right?
Yeah.

2990
02:08:19,581 --> 02:08:24,340
I mean you start going to the East New 
York and Brownsville and bed stuy.

2991
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:29,410
You're talking bench die do or die and 
now there's like a white guys named chip

2992
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,420
walking around.
It's like,

2993
02:08:30,430 --> 02:08:32,450
what's happening?
So strange.

2994
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:34,270
It's bizarre.
Gentrification.

2995
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:36,610
Just bizarre in general because I'm 
like,

2996
02:08:36,611 --> 02:08:37,444
Yo,
where are you putting the people that 

2997
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:40,480
are leaving?
Where are they going?

2998
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:43,000
Well,
who's responsibilities if you like,

2999
02:08:43,001 --> 02:08:43,834
if you wanted to buy a building,
are you supposed to think about the 

3000
02:08:45,521 --> 02:08:46,354
people that are poor that are there?
He's supposed to think about your money 

3001
02:08:48,041 --> 02:08:51,580
that you're buying the building for the 
people that want to do it have to be cut

3002
02:08:51,581 --> 02:08:54,250
from a different cloth.
Cut from.

3003
02:08:54,251 --> 02:08:56,230
I couldn't do that.
I couldn't do that.

3004
02:08:56,231 --> 02:09:00,580
Just displaced people don't.
It's just you have to.

3005
02:09:01,190 --> 02:09:05,620
There's a cutthroat mentality that's 
needed and edits needed in the um,

3006
02:09:06,100 --> 02:09:10,570
the music and entertainment industry 
that I don't have and it's probably held

3007
02:09:10,571 --> 02:09:14,460
me back by being just like a good guy 
there.

3008
02:09:14,470 --> 02:09:15,000
Shit,
I shouldn't.

3009
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,040
So,
like in what way,

3010
02:09:16,041 --> 02:09:18,580
what should,
what could you have done that would have

3011
02:09:18,640 --> 02:09:21,230
propelled you further?
Um,

3012
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:24,010
well,
as far as far as like,

3013
02:09:24,190 --> 02:09:26,950
as far as being more popular,
I don't know,

3014
02:09:26,951 --> 02:09:28,690
but decisions I've made,
like when,

3015
02:09:29,110 --> 02:09:30,370
when you said,
um,

3016
02:09:30,910 --> 02:09:32,830
you know,
you would pay for your buddies to come,

3017
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:34,023
and I do too.

3018
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:38,680
Now if we had like a financial advisor,
they'd be like,

3019
02:09:38,681 --> 02:09:42,430
you two are morons for doing that.
I would tell them these wrong.

3020
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:45,040
I'll be performing better,
so it'd be better.

3021
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:50,041
Shows like my lawyer is like,
you're the worst client ever.

3022
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:55,330
You pay everyone you'll pay them to.
Well you pay them to handsomely.

3023
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:57,610
Fuck everybody.
And I'm like,

3024
02:09:57,611 --> 02:09:58,444
Yo man.
Like I don't know if that helps you get 

3025
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:03,160
by the.
I don't think that really advances you.

3026
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:05,950
Like if you have that mentality,
I don't think that really advances you.

3027
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:09,670
I think what advances you is great work 
and what is fair?

3028
02:10:09,730 --> 02:10:10,563
What does it take to make great work?
I think there's got to be a certain 

3029
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:13,504
amount of.
You have to have a certain amount of 

3030
02:10:14,681 --> 02:10:16,780
chaos but also a certain amount of 
peace.

3031
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:17,531
Yeah,
of course.

3032
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:18,364
You know,
you get those from the decisions that 

3033
02:10:20,861 --> 02:10:21,694
you've made that I've made that 
ultimately get made them because that's 

3034
02:10:25,001 --> 02:10:25,834
who you are.

3035
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:27,133
Yeah.
Well I think in order for me to have 

3036
02:10:31,061 --> 02:10:31,894
altered who I am,
then I would have had to live with that 

3037
02:10:34,161 --> 02:10:35,330
too.
Yeah.

3038
02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:37,900
And I don't want to not be who I am 
because if I,

3039
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:39,163
I wouldn't want to do the success,
would it mean anything to me if I got 

3040
02:10:43,491 --> 02:10:44,324
there by not being me?
You gotta live with that and that's 

3041
02:10:47,661 --> 02:10:51,350
worse than not succeeding to me.
I don't know about other people.

3042
02:10:51,351 --> 02:10:52,184
A lot of people just fake it and they're
not who they are and they're okay with 

3043
02:10:55,311 --> 02:10:58,550
that.
If it comes with success in order for me

3044
02:10:58,551 --> 02:11:03,080
to shift who I am inherently my fiber of
my being,

3045
02:11:03,081 --> 02:11:05,180
the way that I was raised to treat 
people,

3046
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:10,660
if I had to shift that and have success,
the success wouldn't be success to me.

3047
02:11:11,240 --> 02:11:15,050
It won't be on paper,
but not business is just so strange.

3048
02:11:15,650 --> 02:11:16,483
Right.
And I don't know how you feel about 

3049
02:11:18,411 --> 02:11:19,244
mumble rap,
but mumble rap is one of the weirdest 

3050
02:11:21,201 --> 02:11:21,710
things.
To me.

3051
02:11:21,710 --> 02:11:23,240
It's.
I'm confused.

3052
02:11:23,241 --> 02:11:25,970
It's bizarre.
It's bizarre what is happening.

3053
02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:26,923
I just,
I feel like I feel like I don't want to 

3054
02:11:29,391 --> 02:11:33,680
be that dude who doesn't get it right.
You know what I mean?

3055
02:11:33,681 --> 02:11:34,690
You don't get it.
I don't,

3056
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:36,320
I don't get it either.
I don't.

3057
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:37,183
But when you start dealing with youth 
culture and when I was the age of these 

3058
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:44,140
mumble rap kids,
they were older heads saying,

3059
02:11:44,141 --> 02:11:45,230
yeah,
you know,

3060
02:11:45,260 --> 02:11:45,690
the,
the,

3061
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:50,180
the generation before roster,
the cold crush brothers to the big daddy

3062
02:11:50,181 --> 02:11:51,014
kane.
So they probably thought what we were 

3063
02:11:51,561 --> 02:11:53,870
doing was crazy.
So is that what's happening?

3064
02:11:53,871 --> 02:11:55,250
I don't know.
Maybe everyone's like,

3065
02:11:55,251 --> 02:11:56,880
what the fuck is that?
It's like I,

3066
02:11:57,030 --> 02:11:59,120
I,
it's to the point where me,

3067
02:11:59,121 --> 02:11:59,871
where I'm like,
Yo,

3068
02:11:59,871 --> 02:12:01,400
is that even a genre of rap?

3069
02:12:02,150 --> 02:12:04,670
Like I almost look at it.
I guess I don't.

3070
02:12:04,910 --> 02:12:07,630
I guess I don't have a problem with it 
because I don't process it.

3071
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:11,480
Is anything close to what I do.
It's almost like if you said,

3072
02:12:11,481 --> 02:12:12,830
Yo,
what do you think about Edm?

3073
02:12:12,831 --> 02:12:13,281
I'd be like,
oh,

3074
02:12:13,281 --> 02:12:14,560
I don't know.
I guess it's all right.

3075
02:12:14,561 --> 02:12:15,490
It's right.
Right.

3076
02:12:15,550 --> 02:12:18,260
I don't even look at it like I can't 
listen to that.

3077
02:12:18,261 --> 02:12:19,094
And then let him hear big daddy Kane and
think it's the same thing when we were 

3078
02:12:21,351 --> 02:12:22,880
kids listening to music.
Right.

3079
02:12:22,881 --> 02:12:26,600
If you were listening to something that 
you enjoyed,

3080
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:30,290
one of the things you loved was like 
good lyrics of course,

3081
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,300
and when you can't understand what 
they're saying.

3082
02:12:32,301 --> 02:12:33,860
Yeah.
It's also,

3083
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:36,920
it's just so driven by,
if it's like phrase driven,

3084
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:40,040
they just say whatever the learning over
and over and over again.

3085
02:12:40,041 --> 02:12:40,874
Yeah.
I don't know if it's just because these 

3086
02:12:41,901 --> 02:12:42,734
kids are doing my alley or whatever and 
they're just in the zone is a drug 

3087
02:12:45,171 --> 02:12:47,110
culture because that's happened before 
Tuesday.

3088
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:49,340
You know,
one thing creates the other.

3089
02:12:49,341 --> 02:12:50,174
It's like chicken or the egg.
Are these kids doing molly and make 

3090
02:12:51,981 --> 02:12:55,880
mumble rap or they don't mumble rap and 
they eat molly and it's all,

3091
02:12:55,881 --> 02:12:56,630
it's,
you know,

3092
02:12:56,630 --> 02:12:57,463
the sixties,
you going back to the fifties and 

3093
02:13:00,290 --> 02:13:04,430
beatniks in that scene and jazz and 
heroin and w w what created it,

3094
02:13:04,431 --> 02:13:05,264
you know what I mean?
That miles and Coltrane make some of 

3095
02:13:06,771 --> 02:13:10,160
those records because they were on 
heroin or vice versa.

3096
02:13:10,161 --> 02:13:13,850
And it's happened historically.
Is this just a drug driven culture?

3097
02:13:13,851 --> 02:13:15,680
I don't know because I,
it's,

3098
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:17,300
I'm detached.
You know,

3099
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:20,030
I'm detaching and I,
and you know,

3100
02:13:20,031 --> 02:13:21,380
I'm,
I'm a kid who grew up,

3101
02:13:21,610 --> 02:13:23,840
you know,
listening to metal and stuff like that.

3102
02:13:23,841 --> 02:13:24,740
So I,
I don't,

3103
02:13:25,010 --> 02:13:27,680
I'm not at a shortage for.
I'll listen to slayer,

3104
02:13:27,950 --> 02:13:30,020
I'll just listen to slayer before I 
listened to that.

3105
02:13:30,021 --> 02:13:32,640
If that's my only option,
then I'll listen to slayer.

3106
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,980
You know what I mean?
I listen to black flag,

3107
02:13:35,040 --> 02:13:38,580
I'll listen to minor threat.
That's what I'll do it.

3108
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,820
So there,
whether I,

3109
02:13:42,360 --> 02:13:43,193
however I feel about it,
it becomes irrelevant when you realize 

3110
02:13:45,270 --> 02:13:48,780
that you have so much good shit out 
there.

3111
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:51,780
So I don't need.
It's like with film,

3112
02:13:51,781 --> 02:13:54,650
like I'm not worried about a bad movie.
I just watched the dope movie.

3113
02:13:55,090 --> 02:13:57,330
There's so many movies and just throwing
them away.

3114
02:13:57,360 --> 02:13:59,670
Right.
And it's like,

3115
02:13:59,671 --> 02:14:01,950
Yo,
I'll just listen to thin lizzy if I,

3116
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:05,520
if I don't feel like adjusting to that,
you know what I mean?

3117
02:14:05,521 --> 02:14:06,354
And,
and there's other things that we might 

3118
02:14:07,711 --> 02:14:09,630
not get because we're not doing what we 
used to do.

3119
02:14:09,631 --> 02:14:10,464
Maybe it really were.
I was a bar of the clubs five nights a 

3120
02:14:12,211 --> 02:14:15,350
week and you weren't married with kids 
and we were hired.

3121
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:18,420
Maybe it sounds different right at the 
time and place.

3122
02:14:18,420 --> 02:14:19,253
Shit.
It's like you hear certain songs and 

3123
02:14:20,581 --> 02:14:22,230
you're like,
I'm not listening to my car.

3124
02:14:22,231 --> 02:14:24,270
I'm rolling the windows up.
If someone sees this,

3125
02:14:24,630 --> 02:14:25,463
but maybe hit it affects them 
differently in a live environment and 

3126
02:14:27,481 --> 02:14:28,021
something.
I don't know.

3127
02:14:28,021 --> 02:14:30,490
I'm playing devil's advocate just just 
to.

3128
02:14:30,520 --> 02:14:33,810
It's just a strange trend where it's a 
lot of mumbling.

3129
02:14:33,990 --> 02:14:34,880
I'm like,
what is.

3130
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:36,660
I don't know what they're on about cough
syrup.

3131
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:38,990
Yeah.
I think it's just lean and I.

3132
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:43,550
and I think that that,
that drug culture created that I think a

3133
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:44,910
friend of mine who's a real estate 
agent,

3134
02:14:45,250 --> 02:14:48,240
a mumble rapper was working in the house
and she's like,

3135
02:14:48,241 --> 02:14:51,310
I literally had no idea what the fuck he
was saying.

3136
02:14:51,350 --> 02:14:53,280
Oh,
he's talking to him and him talking as a

3137
02:14:53,281 --> 02:14:57,940
human.
As my momma just momma see.

3138
02:14:58,070 --> 02:15:01,710
I didn't know that.
I thought it was like that style on when

3139
02:15:01,711 --> 02:15:03,960
they arrive,
but maybe was just this one,

3140
02:15:04,080 --> 02:15:07,290
which she was showing them this dope 
house and he's mumbling up a storm.

3141
02:15:07,620 --> 02:15:08,453
Wow.
So he's like asking her for Jacuzzi and 

3142
02:15:10,771 --> 02:15:13,210
she thinks she's ordering a pizza.
I don't know what I mean.

3143
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:14,320
I,
you know,

3144
02:15:14,370 --> 02:15:15,203
I love listening to Nas and I love 
listening to public enemy and clean 

3145
02:15:19,831 --> 02:15:23,070
lyrics.
Then had had a hit to them.

3146
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:26,190
Karen.
One big daddy can.

3147
02:15:26,330 --> 02:15:27,163
Of course.
That's,

3148
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:29,560
that's,
that's the police.

3149
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:32,220
There was,
there was something to it though,

3150
02:15:32,221 --> 02:15:33,054
that you knew that they were trying to 
get a message across along with the 

3151
02:15:36,661 --> 02:15:38,760
music.
It was something cool about it.

3152
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:40,620
Yeah.
I think.

3153
02:15:41,100 --> 02:15:45,030
I think maybe these kids think you can't
do both in our era was different.

3154
02:15:45,031 --> 02:15:48,150
It's like if people could dance to 
public enemy and they were talking about

3155
02:15:48,151 --> 02:15:52,150
what was going on and urban community 
that,

3156
02:15:52,260 --> 02:15:53,450
that Arab.
You could.

3157
02:15:53,580 --> 02:15:55,860
There were,
there were boogie down production,

3158
02:15:55,861 --> 02:15:56,694
krs records.
You could dance the sounds of the 

3159
02:15:58,051 --> 02:15:59,970
police.
You out of here,

3160
02:15:59,971 --> 02:16:00,804
you could dance.

3161
02:16:01,230 --> 02:16:03,740
I think there was a.
there's a disconnect with these kids.

3162
02:16:03,790 --> 02:16:08,790
They don't think you can say something 
and I have people dance or whatever.

3163
02:16:08,971 --> 02:16:12,810
I don't know what these fucking Momma.
Motherfucker just slobber on the corner.

3164
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:13,711
It's just.
Well,

3165
02:16:13,711 --> 02:16:15,360
they all have to have tattoos on their 
face.

3166
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:20,790
It's like another mockery that tattoo 
settled down.

3167
02:16:20,791 --> 02:16:21,361
Man.
You know,

3168
02:16:21,361 --> 02:16:22,194
they don't come off right.
Like I think these kids think they can 

3169
02:16:25,501 --> 02:16:27,480
come off.
I don't think they care.

3170
02:16:27,540 --> 02:16:29,950
I just don't think they care.
I don't think they're thinking.

3171
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,830
I mean it's all this.
I don't give a fuck culture.

3172
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:34,073
It's like you just.
And they're not trying to get cool shit 

3173
02:16:35,831 --> 02:16:37,930
on their face that trying to get like 
scribbles.

3174
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,880
Yeah.
It looks like the drawing,

3175
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:44,500
the face of the drunk aided the party.
That's where they all look like,

3176
02:16:45,280 --> 02:16:46,113
you know,
they all look like that with pink 

3177
02:16:47,801 --> 02:16:48,634
dreads.

3178
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:51,820
There's a lot of rap music that slip 
through the cracks too.

3179
02:16:51,821 --> 02:16:53,620
Like a lot of people forget about 
gangstarr.

3180
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:56,020
Yeah.
And one of the greatest groups ever.

3181
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:56,861
Yeah.
You know,

3182
02:16:56,861 --> 02:16:58,730
but it's like,
it's,

3183
02:16:58,810 --> 02:17:02,380
it becomes the responsibility of the 
culture to uphold that.

3184
02:17:02,440 --> 02:17:05,620
Like when someone like Mitch Hedberg who
passed away young,

3185
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:07,310
someone like Bill Hicks,
it's like the,

3186
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:08,543
the,
the,

3187
02:17:08,710 --> 02:17:12,370
the comedic community is their 
responsibility that those guys don't get

3188
02:17:12,371 --> 02:17:14,530
forgotten.
And it's the same with hip hop.

3189
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:19,240
It's my responsibility to talk about 
gangstarr interviews.

3190
02:17:19,241 --> 02:17:20,930
So the 16 year old kid says,
oh,

3191
02:17:20,931 --> 02:17:23,900
I'll check that out.
It's my responsibility to say,

3192
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:29,010
talk about Big Daddy Kane and Kool g rap
and these dudes so people can call g rap

3193
02:17:29,021 --> 02:17:32,050
a lot of people forget about is the 
greatest of all time.

3194
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:35,930
He was one of the greatest for sure I,
I've listened to so much of his shit.

3195
02:17:36,080 --> 02:17:36,913
To me,
he's the best ever cock blocking just 

3196
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:43,860
ignorance at its finest.
Scott says,

3197
02:17:44,330 --> 02:17:45,163
guy says,
oh,

3198
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:50,640
stand up and wipe his dick on your curt 
might be the best rap lyrical wall time,

3199
02:17:51,320 --> 02:17:55,630
but people forgot about Kool g rap.
But if you thinking about like Hex,

3200
02:17:55,631 --> 02:17:58,480
right?
So he was 33 and that was like 93.

3201
02:17:58,510 --> 02:18:00,730
You know,
there's young kids that love comedy that

3202
02:18:00,731 --> 02:18:01,564
don't know about billing.
Like he influenced my life because 

3203
02:18:04,210 --> 02:18:07,480
towards the end he was doing more social
commentary than anything.

3204
02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:10,390
It wasn't even,
it wasn't even that funny.

3205
02:18:10,520 --> 02:18:11,353
It wasn't just,
it was just like he was expanding his 

3206
02:18:13,841 --> 02:18:16,040
mind.
He felt like talking about it and,

3207
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:17,730
and Hedberg was brilliant.
Like,

3208
02:18:18,410 --> 02:18:19,130
you know,
it's,

3209
02:18:19,130 --> 02:18:21,740
it's our responsibility to carry the 
torch of,

3210
02:18:21,741 --> 02:18:24,470
of all these people that were great 
minds that left too soon.

3211
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:27,220
What Bourdain?
I don't want people to forget about that

3212
02:18:27,221 --> 02:18:27,670
guy.

3213
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:29,260
You know what I'm saying?
You special.

3214
02:18:29,530 --> 02:18:31,780
Well,
luckily we have a lot of shows to watch.

3215
02:18:31,781 --> 02:18:32,614
Yeah.
His show was so unique too because of 

3216
02:18:34,241 --> 02:18:36,230
his narration was going to be 
interesting.

3217
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:37,610
I have,
uh,

3218
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:42,580
the newest one with a w Kamau bell.
I haven't watched that yet,

3219
02:18:42,581 --> 02:18:46,150
but it apparently is the last one where 
he does narration.

3220
02:18:46,210 --> 02:18:46,690
Oh,
okay.

3221
02:18:46,690 --> 02:18:50,290
And then all the other ones for this 
season was after he died.

3222
02:18:50,470 --> 02:18:51,310
Someone else?
No,

3223
02:18:51,311 --> 02:18:51,971
no,
no,

3224
02:18:51,971 --> 02:18:53,800
no.
They're not going to do any narration.

3225
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:57,460
There's gonna.
Let the show play itself out.

3226
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:58,333
Just be what it is.
They're going to do it I guess somehow 

3227
02:18:59,771 --> 02:19:01,600
with editing and they're going to figure
it out.

3228
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:04,030
But man,
it's tough man.

3229
02:19:04,540 --> 02:19:06,340
Another punk rock guy too.
Oh yeah,

3230
02:19:06,341 --> 02:19:08,260
man.
That guy went in the hall,

3231
02:19:08,750 --> 02:19:10,410
man.
He went hold Jay.

3232
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:11,973
Yeah.
If you look at him from 2014 and then 

3233
02:19:14,741 --> 02:19:15,574
look at him for 2018,
like he lived several decades inside of 

3234
02:19:19,271 --> 02:19:22,690
a few years.
He went hard.

3235
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:25,660
Yeah.
I don't know if I recommend it,

3236
02:19:25,690 --> 02:19:28,120
but you know,
I mean

3237
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:30,050
he said it best.
You know,

3238
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:31,093
life.
You should treat life like treat your 

3239
02:19:32,631 --> 02:19:35,540
body like it's an amusement park.
He did.

3240
02:19:35,600 --> 02:19:37,690
Yeah,
I did.

3241
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:41,720
I mean there's something that we,
all we all have in common with all these

3242
02:19:41,721 --> 02:19:44,540
artists is that there's an understanding
that we have,

3243
02:19:44,541 --> 02:19:45,374
that they're all living this w,
w we nonstandard way of getting through 

3244
02:19:51,621 --> 02:19:56,621
this life that they're all living this,
this strange,

3245
02:19:56,721 --> 02:20:01,280
chaotic way and creating these amazing 
things through these strange,

3246
02:20:01,281 --> 02:20:05,350
chaotic existence and we all cling to it
and celebrate it and,

3247
02:20:05,351 --> 02:20:06,320
and look at it.
I mean,

3248
02:20:06,321 --> 02:20:09,530
whether it's Henry Rollins who travels,
he hit,

3249
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:10,580
you know,
his crazy thing.

3250
02:20:10,581 --> 02:20:11,414
He said as a pick a spot on the map and 
travel and stay there for a couple of 

3251
02:20:13,730 --> 02:20:14,563
weeks.
He doesn't even know anybody that goes 

3252
02:20:15,921 --> 02:20:16,754
there or whether it's Bordain who would 
make these shows about it or whether 

3253
02:20:19,641 --> 02:20:22,790
it's musicians or comedians or anybody 
who does these things.

3254
02:20:23,090 --> 02:20:23,923
It's like we.
I think I take comfort in the fact that 

3255
02:20:26,181 --> 02:20:27,014
there's guys like you out there and that
everybody's not trying to be some 

3256
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:32,513
cardigan wearing button down fake 
progressive who's just trying to not 

3257
02:20:37,641 --> 02:20:41,570
have people mad at him.
So was trying to say the things that you

3258
02:20:41,571 --> 02:20:42,404
think you're supposed to say so that 
everybody likes you and then before you 

3259
02:20:44,571 --> 02:20:45,404
know it,
you're dead.

3260
02:20:45,660 --> 02:20:47,570
There's no rebellion.
No,

3261
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:52,020
no personal,
real objective opinions on things and

3262
02:20:52,290 --> 02:20:53,790
everything.
Great.

3263
02:20:53,791 --> 02:20:55,560
That's ever comments come out of a 
valley.

3264
02:20:55,790 --> 02:20:57,720
Yeah.
It's come out of a fuck you.

3265
02:20:58,310 --> 02:21:00,660
If something,
if not a fuck you fuck me.

3266
02:21:01,900 --> 02:21:03,720
Fuck.
What is this?

3267
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:04,870
What are we doing?
Yeah.

3268
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:06,270
I don't know.
Fuck my life.

3269
02:21:06,390 --> 02:21:08,940
Fuck yeah,
and this.

3270
02:21:09,480 --> 02:21:10,313
If I don't know what I'm doing,
then I have to explore everything I can 

3271
02:21:13,921 --> 02:21:16,410
to try to figure out what I'm doing.
You know what I mean?

3272
02:21:16,770 --> 02:21:20,430
That's the only way.
It's the only way to learn is to,

3273
02:21:20,750 --> 02:21:21,583
to live in,
to say I don't know what I'm doing and 

3274
02:21:23,101 --> 02:21:23,934
then,
and then live in a bubble is the 

3275
02:21:25,621 --> 02:21:27,030
antithesis of how to fix that.

3276
02:21:27,090 --> 02:21:28,220
Yeah.
You know,

3277
02:21:29,730 --> 02:21:30,563
and you know the,
the beautiful thing is that a guy like 

3278
02:21:33,991 --> 02:21:34,824
you or me or other people that are 
living in these different alternative 

3279
02:21:38,461 --> 02:21:39,294
lives,
the other thing they do is they send a 

3280
02:21:40,351 --> 02:21:43,590
signal to that kid who's sitting in his 
room right now.

3281
02:21:43,591 --> 02:21:46,800
His parents are yelling at him because 
he's got all ds and he's like,

3282
02:21:47,110 --> 02:21:51,120
I can't fucking do this,
but you know what I really liked to do?

3283
02:21:51,121 --> 02:21:54,120
I really liked to listen to rap or 
really like to listen,

3284
02:21:54,121 --> 02:21:57,150
to stand up for.
I really like to do whatever the fuck it

3285
02:21:57,151 --> 02:21:58,560
is.
I really like to read books.

3286
02:21:58,620 --> 02:22:01,020
I just don't want him telling that kid.
It's okay.

3287
02:22:01,350 --> 02:22:04,240
Is an important part of what we do.
Huge.

3288
02:22:05,320 --> 02:22:06,153
The system that they have set up for you
when you go through this bullshit 

3289
02:22:08,831 --> 02:22:10,600
education process,
then next thing you know,

3290
02:22:10,601 --> 02:22:15,250
you're in some fucking factory job or 
some nonsense cubicle that is not good.

3291
02:22:15,330 --> 02:22:16,950
Right.
And they're not telling you that,

3292
02:22:17,010 --> 02:22:18,600
that,
that educational system,

3293
02:22:18,601 --> 02:22:21,720
they're not telling you anything.
They're not telling you about finance,

3294
02:22:21,721 --> 02:22:23,580
they're not telling you about diet.
They're not telling,

3295
02:22:23,590 --> 02:22:27,030
you know,
think what we learned in high school and

3296
02:22:27,031 --> 02:22:29,400
how it applies to our life.
Almost nothing,

3297
02:22:29,401 --> 02:22:30,540
nothing was.
No.

3298
02:22:30,541 --> 02:22:34,530
It's literally like giving you an engine
with not giving you driving and,

3299
02:22:34,700 --> 02:22:38,070
and,
and think of what they could be doing to

3300
02:22:38,071 --> 02:22:38,904
prepare you.
It's out there like why aren't you 

3301
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:41,813
giving these kids Kafka or Nietzsche or 
why aren't you telling him that this is 

3302
02:22:45,061 --> 02:22:45,894
terrible for you or this is filled with 
chemicals or this is information that 

3303
02:22:50,700 --> 02:22:52,800
needs to be out there.
You know,

3304
02:22:52,801 --> 02:22:53,634
I don't,
I have in terms of did you have a 

3305
02:22:56,191 --> 02:22:59,180
learning about money when you have 
nothing,

3306
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:00,890
you have to have it.
Pay Your bills.

3307
02:23:00,891 --> 02:23:01,291
Yeah,
I know.

3308
02:23:01,291 --> 02:23:02,220
That might be job.

3309
02:23:02,270 --> 02:23:02,910
I.
Yeah.

3310
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:04,050
Don't be a loser.
You're right.

3311
02:23:04,260 --> 02:23:05,580
That's all I know.
Fuck.

3312
02:23:05,950 --> 02:23:08,520
And then how am I going to do that?
Because I don't want to do that.

3313
02:23:08,610 --> 02:23:10,410
I don't want to be in a cubicle.
I know that.

3314
02:23:10,411 --> 02:23:12,990
So how do I maneuver this?
What do I do?

3315
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:14,700
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

3316
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:16,800
And if you tell people you want to try 
something different,

3317
02:23:16,801 --> 02:23:20,240
like I want to be a rapper,
a fuck about it,

3318
02:23:20,250 --> 02:23:21,250
man.
Forget about.

3319
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:23,160
Yes.
Yeah.

3320
02:23:23,161 --> 02:23:26,730
So you're fighting,
you're not just fighting the machine.

3321
02:23:26,731 --> 02:23:28,820
You're fighting people that love you.
Yeah.

3322
02:23:28,890 --> 02:23:30,520
They don't want you to be a loser.
Yeah.

3323
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:31,770
And,
and it's,

3324
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:32,783
it's,
you're trying to do the opposite of 

3325
02:23:34,321 --> 02:23:35,550
that.
You're trying to change.

3326
02:23:36,030 --> 02:23:38,310
You're trying to break the cycle of 
this,

3327
02:23:39,090 --> 02:23:41,010
you know this,
you know,

3328
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:42,353
you go to school,
then you get a job where you go to 

3329
02:23:43,891 --> 02:23:44,724
school,
then you go to college and then you get 

3330
02:23:45,451 --> 02:23:49,020
into $250,000
worth of debt to go work a job.

3331
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:51,900
You hate to pay off that $250,000
debt.

3332
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:53,910
And it's the cycle and that's what the 
country,

3333
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:54,763
the cycle of this country and the fucked
up thing is if you want to do something 

3334
02:23:57,301 --> 02:23:59,070
different,
nobody's there.

3335
02:23:59,080 --> 02:24:00,870
We've got a path for you.
Like if you say,

3336
02:24:00,871 --> 02:24:01,620
Hey,
you know,

3337
02:24:01,620 --> 02:24:04,080
I really love hip hop,
I want to be a rapper,

3338
02:24:05,080 --> 02:24:06,720
then no one says,
oh,

3339
02:24:06,780 --> 02:24:11,040
well that's a viable job opportunity.
Obviously a lot of people are rappers.

3340
02:24:11,340 --> 02:24:13,140
You can do this.
This is something you could do.

3341
02:24:13,290 --> 02:24:14,660
No one says that.
Nobody.

3342
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:15,600
No one.
No.

3343
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:17,790
If you tell them you want to be a 
standup,

3344
02:24:17,791 --> 02:24:19,890
what are you fucking out of your mind?
You're not funny.

3345
02:24:20,400 --> 02:24:22,980
My mom told me that.
Wow.

3346
02:24:23,160 --> 02:24:25,740
I never thought you were very funny.
Alright mom,

3347
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:29,440
I'd talk shit about you and all the 
people laugh and the weightlifting skit.

3348
02:24:29,510 --> 02:24:31,620
You did that.

3349
02:24:32,670 --> 02:24:34,590
That was me and Brian Collins.
Brilliant.

3350
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:35,993
Yeah.
But this alternative lives like outside 

3351
02:24:39,811 --> 02:24:44,811
of the straight and narrow structure 
that most people follow that's available

3352
02:24:45,331 --> 02:24:46,470
to people.
They just have to.

3353
02:24:46,700 --> 02:24:48,900
They have to have more examples of it.
It's,

3354
02:24:48,980 --> 02:24:49,813
it's example.
If people like us are examples and they 

3355
02:24:51,661 --> 02:24:53,430
also.
There is though,

3356
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:55,250
I will say this,
um,

3357
02:24:55,890 --> 02:24:57,560
you have to have balls,
yes,

3358
02:24:57,870 --> 02:25:00,120
to do it and you have to be able to look
at things,

3359
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:02,700
honestly.
Things that aren't of course,

3360
02:25:02,990 --> 02:25:04,590
right.
That shit I didn't do.

3361
02:25:04,650 --> 02:25:06,420
I wasn't,
I wasn't,

3362
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:07,523
um,
I wasn't being self aware at certain 

3363
02:25:10,051 --> 02:25:10,884
times.
And then once you start doing that and 

3364
02:25:12,601 --> 02:25:15,480
saying maybe this is me,
maybe this is me,

3365
02:25:15,481 --> 02:25:18,630
and if I change this and you see instant
results,

3366
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:22,110
you know what I mean.
How long have you been doing it for A.

3367
02:25:22,410 --> 02:25:25,150
I wrote my first rhyme at nine,
but it was like the worst thing ever.

3368
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:27,590
What was your early influences?
Uh,

3369
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:29,570
the car?
Well,

3370
02:25:29,620 --> 02:25:33,400
my brothers brought home suck MCS that 
was 83.

3371
02:25:33,560 --> 02:25:37,740
It was like little.
I played on like muppets a turntable.

3372
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:39,543
And uh,
the first record where I said I want to 

3373
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:44,380
rap was a latte.
This cuts got flavor.

3374
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:45,730
I was like,
I want to do this.

3375
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:49,470
And then I did a member candy girl by 
new edition.

3376
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:52,510
I did.
I wrapped on that at the end,

3377
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:55,230
like third grade talent show.
Really?

3378
02:25:55,231 --> 02:25:55,830
Yeah.
Bird.

3379
02:25:55,830 --> 02:25:56,663
Great.
My Mom's got it on vhs and threatens me 

3380
02:25:59,171 --> 02:25:59,681
with it.
I'm like,

3381
02:25:59,681 --> 02:26:00,900
that's not a threat.
I put it off.

3382
02:26:02,350 --> 02:26:07,350
Got To threaten me with that.
When I was in junior high school,

3383
02:26:07,841 --> 02:26:10,000
I heard Sugar Hill gang for the very 
first time.

3384
02:26:10,030 --> 02:26:12,430
It's like life changing.
I remember thinking,

3385
02:26:12,431 --> 02:26:13,264
Whoa,
this is a new kind of music is a new 

3386
02:26:14,891 --> 02:26:17,490
thing.
Hip Hop and hippie creativity,

3387
02:26:17,530 --> 02:26:18,760
hip hop activity beat.

3388
02:26:18,760 --> 02:26:20,770
Don't stop a rocket to the bank.
Jumped buggy.

3389
02:26:20,890 --> 02:26:21,701
Crazy.
Yeah.

3390
02:26:21,701 --> 02:26:23,140
I mean I remember thinking like,
wow,

3391
02:26:23,141 --> 02:26:24,580
this is a new thing.
Yeah.

3392
02:26:24,940 --> 02:26:29,130
And then when run DMC was so hard with 
sucker MCS,

3393
02:26:29,450 --> 02:26:31,390
Yo,
what the fuck is this?

3394
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:35,170
Because she'll get hell.
I obviously love that.

3395
02:26:35,180 --> 02:26:36,013
Reagan changed the course of the history
but they were rhyming over the sheik 

3396
02:26:38,441 --> 02:26:39,274
instrumental,
you know,

3397
02:26:39,570 --> 02:26:42,530
so,
but when suck just those drums,

3398
02:26:43,560 --> 02:26:46,270
those hard drugs.
And then being from Philly,

3399
02:26:46,271 --> 02:26:48,850
like hearing school a day and like,
you know,

3400
02:26:48,920 --> 02:26:51,940
got these hard records.
But like first time,

3401
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:54,190
first time,
like I rhymed,

3402
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:58,570
like to record something like um,
like 90 91,

3403
02:26:59,360 --> 02:27:00,610
you know,
and it was awful,

3404
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:02,080
you know.
But.

3405
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:03,573
So you just work on your craft and hope 
that you get to a point where people 

3406
02:27:08,591 --> 02:27:11,050
don't think you're awful.
When did you start getting paid?

3407
02:27:11,620 --> 02:27:15,430
Um,
let me see.

3408
02:27:15,460 --> 02:27:16,293
So we put out an APP on our own that we 
pressed up in [inaudible] 96 and I'm 

3409
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:23,050
like,
where I was like,

3410
02:27:24,010 --> 02:27:26,590
I'm living off wrap.
Does that weigh 98,

3411
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:29,860
98?
Um,

3412
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:32,380
but what kind of jobs do you have a 
before you.

3413
02:27:32,470 --> 02:27:34,360
I didn't really have jobs.
I like,

3414
02:27:34,810 --> 02:27:39,810
I'm a dirt bag.
Therapeutic Shit.

3415
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:42,760
Yeah,
for a couple years after high school,

3416
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:45,370
just,
just some scumbag shit.

3417
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:47,950
And then the first check came and I was 
like,

3418
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:50,620
there's no turning back now man.
You know what I mean?

3419
02:27:50,621 --> 02:27:51,454
This is the greatest shit ever.
Like money from what you wanted to buy 

3420
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:57,040
Jordans from rapping.
What are you talking about?

3421
02:27:57,160 --> 02:27:59,380
Yeah,
blew my fucking mind,

3422
02:27:59,381 --> 02:28:00,200
man.
You know,

3423
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:01,930
blew my mind.
Like,

3424
02:28:02,230 --> 02:28:03,970
you know,
buying a pair of Jordans with that.

3425
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:05,680
With that.
It's unreal.

3426
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:08,330
But yeah,
like never a.

3427
02:28:09,560 --> 02:28:13,690
If I can die never having a square gigs,
I consider it a success.

3428
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:17,860
Yeah.
When did you really say to yourself,

3429
02:28:17,920 --> 02:28:20,470
okay,
I'm a legit professional now,

3430
02:28:20,500 --> 02:28:22,880
like this is it.
There's no turning back.

3431
02:28:22,910 --> 02:28:23,743
I'm 100 percent now.
Like I don't have to worry about this 

3432
02:28:25,461 --> 02:28:29,700
going away.
I still don't think that really it,

3433
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:33,740
it's the fear again.
It's the fear of like the second I think

3434
02:28:33,741 --> 02:28:35,360
that it'll go away.
You know what I mean?

3435
02:28:35,370 --> 02:28:38,450
Things get bigger.
Our office gets bigger,

3436
02:28:38,500 --> 02:28:39,333
the,
you know,

3437
02:28:39,350 --> 02:28:41,730
the merge business grows the,
towards growing.

3438
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:44,630
I'm still,
the fear is,

3439
02:28:44,890 --> 02:28:47,580
is like Yo,
I'm,

3440
02:28:47,910 --> 02:28:48,743
I'm just lucky.
I just feel lucky that I'm able to do 

3441
02:28:51,111 --> 02:28:52,700
it.
So I never want to think that way.

3442
02:28:52,760 --> 02:28:55,280
You know?
I guess I have to answer the question.

3443
02:28:55,281 --> 02:28:56,930
If someone,
a stranger says,

3444
02:28:56,931 --> 02:28:58,670
what do you do?
You know,

3445
02:28:58,790 --> 02:28:59,623
I have to answer it because it is what I
do and I made a lot of money and I'm 

3446
02:29:02,961 --> 02:29:03,360
good.

3447
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:05,090
My mom's good because of it,
you know?

3448
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:09,500
But I feel like the day that I,
I feel like that,

3449
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,640
that,
that,

3450
02:29:10,670 --> 02:29:13,190
that may be a,
I don't know,

3451
02:29:13,191 --> 02:29:14,500
you know,
like the philosophy when a,

3452
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,800
when a fight is thinking of retirement,
it means there were two,

3453
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:21,290
they're already retired and I am sort of
applying that logic.

3454
02:29:21,291 --> 02:29:23,180
Like the second I say,
Yo,

3455
02:29:23,181 --> 02:29:23,961
this is my thing,
you know,

3456
02:29:23,961 --> 02:29:27,500
I could play for 75,000
kids in a festival in Switzerland.

3457
02:29:27,501 --> 02:29:28,334
I still,
I'm still standing on a piece of 

3458
02:29:29,631 --> 02:29:30,464
garbage,
you know,

3459
02:29:30,710 --> 02:29:33,800
and that sort of like withdrawing.
It's sort of a driving thing with me,

3460
02:29:33,801 --> 02:29:35,180
you know what I mean?
Whereas,

3461
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:36,523
you know,
historically rapids just been so ego 

3462
02:29:38,351 --> 02:29:39,640
driven.
I'm the bad stuff.

3463
02:29:39,930 --> 02:29:41,640
That's the cornerstone of it when you 
Ryan.

3464
02:29:41,641 --> 02:29:44,570
But some people carry themselves like 
that in real life,

3465
02:29:45,110 --> 02:29:47,780
you know,
and I don't want to be that man.

3466
02:29:47,870 --> 02:29:50,150
You know,
it's like I'm so,

3467
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:52,273
I'm so scared of someone ever thinking 
that humility isn't the most important 

3468
02:29:57,141 --> 02:29:57,974
thing to me.
And being polite is the most important 

3469
02:29:59,991 --> 02:30:00,860
thing to me,
you know?

3470
02:30:00,861 --> 02:30:01,694
And it is.
And that's not really how people are in 

3471
02:30:03,561 --> 02:30:05,060
this game,
you know?

3472
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:05,470
And,
and,

3473
02:30:05,470 --> 02:30:07,950
and not just a wrap,
just the entertainment business and they

3474
02:30:07,951 --> 02:30:10,130
don't meet an actor who's addicted like,
Yo,

3475
02:30:10,131 --> 02:30:11,420
man,
you get paid to act.

3476
02:30:11,960 --> 02:30:13,280
You get,
that's a blessing.

3477
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,590
We're lucky to be here.
Right here.

3478
02:30:15,591 --> 02:30:19,070
I'm,
I'm just blessed to be sitting here with

3479
02:30:19,071 --> 02:30:20,200
you man.
So why would I,

3480
02:30:20,360 --> 02:30:22,460
why would I be anything but appreciative
of that?

3481
02:30:22,461 --> 02:30:24,280
And I don't want to think,
oh,

3482
02:30:24,330 --> 02:30:27,070
this is what I do.
I just want to like live in,

3483
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:28,970
in the moment.
Yeah.

3484
02:30:28,971 --> 02:30:31,820
Maybe when it's over I'll tell you,
Yo,

3485
02:30:31,821 --> 02:30:32,654
I was a tour.
If you say you're not going to tour 

3486
02:30:34,491 --> 02:30:35,324
again,
do you mean you want tour 

3487
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:37,900
internationally or you want tour?

3488
02:30:37,910 --> 02:30:40,550
Will you still perform locally?
Like what are you going to do?

3489
02:30:40,850 --> 02:30:42,370
Well,
the,

3490
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:48,370
I just landed a yesterday from so that 
we did,

3491
02:30:49,290 --> 02:30:52,160
we started in Baltimore,
Baltimore,

3492
02:30:52,161 --> 02:30:54,290
New York,
Philly,

3493
02:30:55,790 --> 02:30:59,120
Boston,
have a mind and to,

3494
02:30:59,490 --> 02:31:03,680
to sell out your hometown.
Then it's like this many years later,

3495
02:31:04,520 --> 02:31:06,700
you know,
and to sell out in New York and sell out

3496
02:31:06,701 --> 02:31:07,910
Boston.
It's this thing,

3497
02:31:07,911 --> 02:31:11,420
that way it's still fucking mind 
blowing.

3498
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:12,823
You know what I mean?
And it's still people cheering your 

3499
02:31:14,781 --> 02:31:15,471
name,
it's mine,

3500
02:31:15,471 --> 02:31:17,390
but I just,
maybe I just,

3501
02:31:17,450 --> 02:31:22,230
maybe it's more of like sometimes people
need to decompress and maybe I just need

3502
02:31:22,231 --> 02:31:23,064
to decompress for a little bit and I 
completely changed my mind and just not 

3503
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:27,120
just,
not toward next year or something,

3504
02:31:27,121 --> 02:31:27,954
you know?
And then maybe I'll be ready or 

3505
02:31:28,621 --> 02:31:30,210
something.
It's just,

3506
02:31:31,440 --> 02:31:33,580
I love walking out on that stage.
Man.

3507
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:35,670
I love being out here talking to you.

3508
02:31:35,670 --> 02:31:38,070
I love you.
I was with be real yesterday from Cyprus

3509
02:31:38,071 --> 02:31:41,310
doing his stuff.
I love all the smoke box.

3510
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:46,860
I would lose my fucking brain.
It was just him in there with that Bro.

3511
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:51,480
Well I don't have to tell you they were 
smoking heavy.

3512
02:31:51,481 --> 02:31:53,910
I think I walked out zonked.
Just being in the room with them.

3513
02:31:53,990 --> 02:31:55,080
I'm sure.
Yeah,

3514
02:31:55,081 --> 02:31:56,550
I was zapped.
Yeah.

3515
02:31:56,551 --> 02:31:58,020
He's one of those all day,
dude.

3516
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:00,870
I can't do that.
Yes sir.

3517
02:32:01,230 --> 02:32:02,760
Have too much stuff to do.
Yeah,

3518
02:32:02,761 --> 02:32:03,810
sure.
Of course.

3519
02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:06,243
He's getting shit done though.
Is one of those rare individuals can 

3520
02:32:10,230 --> 02:32:11,670
stay stoned,
but uh,

3521
02:32:12,090 --> 02:32:12,571
yeah,
no,

3522
02:32:12,571 --> 02:32:15,830
I just,
I think maybe some decompression I like,

3523
02:32:16,270 --> 02:32:19,650
I think like a and Dante circles of 
hell.

3524
02:32:19,651 --> 02:32:24,090
I think airports might be on there.
There's loads of them.

3525
02:32:24,990 --> 02:32:28,310
I hate the whole process of checking in 
like this.

3526
02:32:28,330 --> 02:32:29,940
That's like,
you know,

3527
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:31,043
people,
God bless people who have that private 

3528
02:32:32,401 --> 02:32:35,010
jet money that Elon Musk money,
you know what I'm saying?

3529
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:37,500
Like we did.
But that's wasting your,

3530
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:38,423
you're burning off all that cash short.
Like if you're making 100 and spending 

3531
02:32:42,181 --> 02:32:44,380
40 on the jet like Shit,
man.

3532
02:32:44,870 --> 02:32:47,900
To know indeed.
It's just um,

3533
02:32:48,010 --> 02:32:48,700
the,
the,

3534
02:32:48,700 --> 02:32:49,533
the process man.
It's when you were talking about being 

3535
02:32:52,021 --> 02:32:53,940
alone in hotel rooms.
I hate,

3536
02:32:54,090 --> 02:32:54,923
I hate the hurry up and wait of all of 
the entertainment industry and that's 

3537
02:32:57,901 --> 02:32:59,090
what it's built around.
You know,

3538
02:32:59,091 --> 02:32:59,924
it's still trips me out when I wake up 
in the morning and look at the ceiling 

3539
02:33:02,011 --> 02:33:04,580
and I don't remember where I am.
Yo.

3540
02:33:04,740 --> 02:33:05,850
Ohio?
No.

3541
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,130
Yes.
Silly.

3542
02:33:07,350 --> 02:33:07,941
No,
no,

3543
02:33:07,941 --> 02:33:08,390
no,
no.

3544
02:33:08,390 --> 02:33:10,010
Yes,
yes.

3545
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:10,591
Oh,
like,

3546
02:33:10,591 --> 02:33:11,880
Yo,
what country am I in?

3547
02:33:11,881 --> 02:33:13,170
Yeah,
it's fucked.

3548
02:33:13,740 --> 02:33:15,060
It's fucked.
It's weird.

3549
02:33:15,150 --> 02:33:19,020
It's very weird.
Do you think when you take the time off,

3550
02:33:19,060 --> 02:33:21,960
are you gonna still right?
And you get a storm in the studio?

3551
02:33:21,961 --> 02:33:22,794
I write,
I write five days a week and I record 

3552
02:33:25,711 --> 02:33:28,350
every Thursday,
every Thursday.

3553
02:33:28,380 --> 02:33:29,710
Every Thursday.
Yeah.

3554
02:33:29,820 --> 02:33:32,400
So you write five days a week now what's
your process like?

3555
02:33:32,401 --> 02:33:35,220
How do you write?
It has to be super late at night.

3556
02:33:35,840 --> 02:33:38,310
Um,
yeah I can't,

3557
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:40,260
I really can't do anything during the 
day.

3558
02:33:41,060 --> 02:33:43,300
MMM.
MMM.

3559
02:33:43,810 --> 02:33:46,270
Just a nocturnal by nature.

3560
02:33:47,240 --> 02:33:48,073
Um,

3561
02:33:49,170 --> 02:33:52,950
I just sit there with a beat blasting.
Just sit there.

3562
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:54,510
Yeah,
let it come.

3563
02:33:55,230 --> 02:33:56,550
One Bar,
one bar,

3564
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:57,420
one bar

3565
02:33:57,420 --> 02:33:58,253
until it's done.
So do you have like a raw beet with no 

3566
02:34:00,091 --> 02:34:01,550
lyrics and then.
Yeah.

3567
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:04,690
So who,
who makes a beat for your first um,

3568
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:06,113
that I worked with a lot of producers.
So when those send them and when I love 

3569
02:34:08,971 --> 02:34:10,050
something I go,
all right,

3570
02:34:10,051 --> 02:34:11,290
I'm going to work on this tonight.
You know,

3571
02:34:11,310 --> 02:34:12,143
so you get the beat and then,
and then you sit and listen to it and 

3572
02:34:14,611 --> 02:34:17,150
you start thinking about things.
Exactly.

3573
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:18,273
Ah,
what's the hardest thing for me as the 

3574
02:34:20,891 --> 02:34:22,900
first line?
Whereas the hardest thing,

3575
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:26,160
I'm,
they're the authors say this exactly,

3576
02:34:26,180 --> 02:34:27,290
he hit him.
I'm sure.

3577
02:34:27,291 --> 02:34:30,580
I mean the first joke probably hard 
because everything goes off of that,

3578
02:34:31,120 --> 02:34:32,940
you know what I mean?
So it's that,

3579
02:34:32,970 --> 02:34:35,840
that line is super hard.
Um,

3580
02:34:36,940 --> 02:34:38,120
and then I,
I,

3581
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:41,270
I love being in the studio.
I love it.

3582
02:34:41,350 --> 02:34:43,600
The whole,
that's where I would be,

3583
02:34:43,650 --> 02:34:44,483
um,
unfortunately because when we were kids 

3584
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:48,460
records sold,
right?

3585
02:34:48,850 --> 02:34:50,440
So you could be like,
I don't want a tour,

3586
02:34:50,441 --> 02:34:51,760
I'm fucking,
I'm the,

3587
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:53,950
were the Beatles.
We sold fucking $100,000,000

3588
02:34:53,951 --> 02:34:56,500
because we don't have to tour.
They just decided they didn't want a toy

3589
02:34:56,510 --> 02:34:59,680
at 67 and they never did again.
Yeah.

3590
02:34:59,980 --> 02:35:00,910
You know what I mean?
But,

3591
02:35:00,940 --> 02:35:01,773
but it's,
everything is generated monetarily 

3592
02:35:04,631 --> 02:35:06,190
through touring,
merge,

3593
02:35:06,490 --> 02:35:07,323
you know what I mean?
So it's like the grind is there and I 

3594
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:12,990
don't like to feel like my hand is 
forced ever because that,

3595
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:15,520
that's when it starts.
That's that square world.

3596
02:35:16,070 --> 02:35:16,903
And I never want to feel like I'm 
obligated to do something and that can 

3597
02:35:19,931 --> 02:35:23,410
be some of my animosity towards Tori.
You know what I mean?

3598
02:35:23,411 --> 02:35:23,801
Like,
you know,

3599
02:35:23,801 --> 02:35:26,110
this is what you do,
this is what you have to do,

3600
02:35:26,680 --> 02:35:28,360
you know,
go out this many days.

3601
02:35:28,361 --> 02:35:29,250
That's just this.
Like,

3602
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:30,990
it's,
it's just uh,

3603
02:35:31,150 --> 02:35:32,800
it just fries my brain,
man,

3604
02:35:32,801 --> 02:35:33,634
you know,
I know obviously all this shit takes a 

3605
02:35:36,041 --> 02:35:36,874
physical toll on you,
but if it fries my brain where I'm like 

3606
02:35:40,480 --> 02:35:42,130
just completely zonked.

3607
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:47,470
Like I'm a walking through life.
I never know.

3608
02:35:47,530 --> 02:35:49,230
Like I never see anything.
People are like,

3609
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:51,580
how is Blah Blah Blah.
The how is the loop.

3610
02:35:51,581 --> 02:35:52,840
I'm like,
I never saw that shit.

3611
02:35:53,740 --> 02:35:55,780
You know,
like how is the blah blah blah.

3612
02:35:55,820 --> 02:35:58,120
And they all the same shit man.
It's like,

3613
02:35:58,660 --> 02:35:59,620
oh,
how was Bob?

3614
02:35:59,650 --> 02:36:03,360
I never saw shit man.
Nothing ever.

3615
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:06,370
No room venue,
hotel rooms,

3616
02:36:06,400 --> 02:36:08,530
van or box or whatever.
You know what I mean?

3617
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:10,780
It's ran,
repeat,

3618
02:36:11,410 --> 02:36:12,130
rinse,
repeat.

3619
02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:13,270
You know,
and people,

3620
02:36:13,330 --> 02:36:15,670
you know,
people like I said,

3621
02:36:15,671 --> 02:36:20,080
like I think it just the entertainment 
business in general,

3622
02:36:20,081 --> 02:36:21,030
it's,
there's a,

3623
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:26,120
there's a perception that it isn't work 
because it's not the work that they do.

3624
02:36:29,580 --> 02:36:32,030
Like try working on a car all day.
I'm like,

3625
02:36:32,470 --> 02:36:33,303
try driving 15 hours with someone who 
smells like balls in a tour van or you 

3626
02:36:37,821 --> 02:36:38,350
know,
like,

3627
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:40,790
or try to take it though,
right?

3628
02:36:40,790 --> 02:36:44,140
I mean you'll take it over a regular 
course when you write,

3629
02:36:44,141 --> 02:36:47,080
do you write with a pencil and paper?
Do you write in your head?

3630
02:36:47,081 --> 02:36:49,810
Do you write on a computer?
I uh,

3631
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:50,913
I wrote in a rhyme book just like a 
spiral Ryan Book for you for all my 

3632
02:36:54,941 --> 02:36:55,774
adult life.
And then I started not being able to 

3633
02:36:56,921 --> 02:36:57,754
read my hand writing.
I write like a graffiti writer and I'd 

3634
02:37:00,911 --> 02:37:01,870
be like,
what's this word?

3635
02:37:02,590 --> 02:37:04,370
So now I go,
what I do,

3636
02:37:04,410 --> 02:37:07,060
I go over my head when I have enough,
when I have enough,

3637
02:37:07,061 --> 02:37:08,950
I'll type it out,
you know?

3638
02:37:08,951 --> 02:37:11,560
And then like go with my hat on my head 
and type it out.

3639
02:37:12,040 --> 02:37:15,980
Now it's like clean and organized,
which is not me know on any level.

3640
02:37:16,010 --> 02:37:17,060
How long have you been doing it that 
way?

3641
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:19,890
Really recent.
Like how was her?

3642
02:37:19,900 --> 02:37:21,620
Was it a year real?
Yeah.

3643
02:37:21,890 --> 02:37:25,020
And do you write like on Microsoft word 
or something like A.

3644
02:37:25,650 --> 02:37:28,850
I don't even know what it is,
just like a note thing on the computer.

3645
02:37:28,851 --> 02:37:31,250
It's called like notepad or something.
Okay.

3646
02:37:31,340 --> 02:37:35,030
Yeah.
But like on a Mac or a PC,

3647
02:37:35,600 --> 02:37:39,110
but,
but that wouldn't go writing five days a

3648
02:37:39,111 --> 02:37:42,320
week and go into the recording every 
Thursday.

3649
02:37:42,350 --> 02:37:44,750
Only started when I stopped the heavy 
drinking.

3650
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:49,940
Like everything changed.
Everything changed because you,

3651
02:37:49,941 --> 02:37:50,774
you,
you don't want to be creative when 

3652
02:37:51,741 --> 02:37:53,100
you're hungover,
you don't want to,

3653
02:37:53,220 --> 02:37:55,640
you want to sleep,
you know what I mean?

3654
02:37:55,641 --> 02:37:56,474
So like I,
I recorded more in the past two years 

3655
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:03,740
than the previous time.
Yeah man.

3656
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:06,290
Yeah.
I have tons of music recorded,

3657
02:38:06,640 --> 02:38:07,473
you know,
maybe it's not all great but it's 

3658
02:38:08,151 --> 02:38:09,110
recorded,
you know,

3659
02:38:09,111 --> 02:38:11,650
and I'm writing and have clarity,
you know,

3660
02:38:12,770 --> 02:38:13,603
on a lot of levels.
Is there any window that you could see 

3661
02:38:16,491 --> 02:38:20,360
opening up or you can make money from 
the actual music itself because it,

3662
02:38:20,440 --> 02:38:21,273
this is a,
I mean the last couple of decades 

3663
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:26,870
through the music business on its head,
but their streaming services now.

3664
02:38:26,871 --> 02:38:27,704
And Jamie was just talking about the 
thing that Steven Tyler was talking 

3665
02:38:30,351 --> 02:38:34,160
about.
It's called music modernization act.

3666
02:38:34,190 --> 02:38:34,970
Yeah.
Yeah,

3667
02:38:34,970 --> 02:38:35,803
that's the thing where they're trying to
get the streaming companies because 

3668
02:38:40,670 --> 02:38:41,990
they're giving you a pittance.

3669
02:38:42,650 --> 02:38:43,483
Well,
Pandora,

3670
02:38:43,730 --> 02:38:44,563
Pandora,
that just sold for billions of dollars 

3671
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:49,160
and it's like,
what do you do?

3672
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:50,113
Right?
You're worth billions of dollars when 

3673
02:38:50,850 --> 02:38:52,730
you do,
you distribute other people's art.

3674
02:38:53,270 --> 02:38:54,860
You don't really have,
don't pay them.

3675
02:38:55,340 --> 02:38:57,110
You don't pay them,
you make all the money.

3676
02:38:57,220 --> 02:38:59,570
You're talking to save pennies on the 
dollar.

3677
02:38:59,630 --> 02:39:01,280
Wouldn't be enough.
I'm not exaggerating.

3678
02:39:01,290 --> 02:39:04,160
It's no.
Um,

3679
02:39:05,030 --> 02:39:09,110
I'm not sure if either one of you guys 
saw the tweet from um,

3680
02:39:10,010 --> 02:39:13,370
a crosby from crosby,
stills and Nash.

3681
02:39:13,700 --> 02:39:14,533
I didn't see it.
It was like a break down of what he got 

3682
02:39:18,141 --> 02:39:19,000
paid for.
You know,

3683
02:39:19,070 --> 02:39:24,070
how huge those records were.
So it was like $55 or something for,

3684
02:39:24,260 --> 02:39:29,260
for like $200 million streams.
And then Peter Frampton responded to him

3685
02:39:29,780 --> 02:39:31,970
with another screenshot and it's like,
here's mine.

3686
02:39:32,270 --> 02:39:33,830
And I have one of the biggest records 
ever.

3687
02:39:33,831 --> 02:39:34,664
Peter Frampton comes alive and they were
going back and forth and like people in 

3688
02:39:37,821 --> 02:39:41,570
the industry will re tweeting it because
I mean these are guys sure,

3689
02:39:41,930 --> 02:39:42,763
a older and be richer than we can ever 
imagine and it's important for people 

3690
02:39:46,851 --> 02:39:47,920
like them to speak up.

3691
02:39:47,920 --> 02:39:51,530
Like was.
I repeat the streamers,

3692
02:39:51,531 --> 02:39:56,480
don't pay us for the damned music that 
we made in all caps.

3693
02:39:56,630 --> 02:40:01,370
Don't pay us this David Crosby and a few
tweets that are similar.

3694
02:40:01,710 --> 02:40:02,543
Yeah,
there's one with the actual numbers and 

3695
02:40:03,961 --> 02:40:04,461
the.
Yeah,

3696
02:40:04,461 --> 02:40:08,810
I mean it's stunning and I don't 
understand how they're getting away with

3697
02:40:08,811 --> 02:40:09,644
it.
I don't either.

3698
02:40:09,650 --> 02:40:12,410
I don't either and I'm not powerful 
enough to do that.

3699
02:40:12,411 --> 02:40:13,244
That's why I do like him.
Like at one point Taylor swift pulled 

3700
02:40:15,961 --> 02:40:19,140
all our shit and I was like,
that's great because she's huge.

3701
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:21,540
That's an important statement.
You know what I mean?

3702
02:40:21,541 --> 02:40:22,374
It's like if,
if you guys weren't getting paid 

3703
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:26,063
correctly from a streaming service for 
you stand up and someone like Eddie 

3704
02:40:31,140 --> 02:40:32,610
Murphy spoke up,
that's important.

3705
02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:34,273
A fucking a hack and Schenectady 
tweeting about it won't let them put my 

3706
02:40:38,971 --> 02:40:42,390
podcast on the and they've been trying 
to do it for years and I'm saying,

3707
02:40:42,391 --> 02:40:42,780
no.

3708
02:40:42,780 --> 02:40:43,470
Yeah.
What,

3709
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:45,280
what do I get out of it?
Well,

3710
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:46,630
it's just another way for people to get 
your,

3711
02:40:46,631 --> 02:40:47,464
you know,
there's a lot of people that are 

3712
02:40:47,881 --> 02:40:48,714
listening.
People are already listening to that 

3713
02:40:51,260 --> 02:40:53,910
shit happens to me.
What will you do this?

3714
02:40:53,911 --> 02:40:55,740
No.
And they're blown away that you say no.

3715
02:40:56,040 --> 02:40:57,810
And again,
that's why I think your punk rock,

3716
02:40:57,990 --> 02:41:00,210
whether you do it not,
you just say fuck you.

3717
02:41:00,560 --> 02:41:02,430
Well I just understand what they're 
doing.

3718
02:41:02,431 --> 02:41:03,264
They're thieves and they want to put ads
on it and they in the most recent thing 

3719
02:41:06,601 --> 02:41:07,434
is that they'll give you some money,
but like now compared to what you're 

3720
02:41:09,991 --> 02:41:11,820
making,
what are you going to do?

3721
02:41:12,260 --> 02:41:14,750
All you have is other people's work,
right?

3722
02:41:14,940 --> 02:41:16,310
Other than that,
you just have a,

3723
02:41:16,530 --> 02:41:18,480
a bus station.
I'm,

3724
02:41:19,280 --> 02:41:22,680
I feel bad for p.
you've built your own everything,

3725
02:41:22,850 --> 02:41:24,240
your,
your own entity.

3726
02:41:24,990 --> 02:41:28,070
I've done the same thing on a smaller 
level where we're,

3727
02:41:28,090 --> 02:41:29,370
we're outliers,
bro.

3728
02:41:29,460 --> 02:41:32,120
Like some people really need that shit 
though,

3729
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:33,023
you know what I mean?
Like when they get stuck in the system 

3730
02:41:34,681 --> 02:41:35,514
and then even worse they become a part 
of some sort of a network where they 

3731
02:41:37,771 --> 02:41:38,604
have a bunch of executives telling them 
what they do is sign those major label 

3732
02:41:42,151 --> 02:41:45,270
deals that are in the videos with the 
jewelry and shit.

3733
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:48,480
None of that shit.
It's either fake,

3734
02:41:48,510 --> 02:41:50,300
it's rented.
Those cars are rented.

3735
02:41:50,550 --> 02:41:53,640
You know what I mean?
There's still living in the projects and

3736
02:41:53,680 --> 02:41:56,580
then they're in those videos with land.
Yeah.

3737
02:41:56,830 --> 02:41:57,663
You know,
it's like perceptions become reality 

3738
02:42:00,151 --> 02:42:02,400
through social media.
So people think like,

3739
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:03,623
you know,
you have a rented car and ran the 

3740
02:42:05,971 --> 02:42:07,980
jewelry on that,
you're worth this.

3741
02:42:07,981 --> 02:42:08,521
And I'm like,
Yo,

3742
02:42:08,521 --> 02:42:10,830
you don't know the fuckery that,
that label over them.

3743
02:42:11,220 --> 02:42:13,580
He's got a three 60 deal they've taken 
is merge.

3744
02:42:13,590 --> 02:42:15,420
They're taking this.
That's what's crazy.

3745
02:42:15,421 --> 02:42:20,421
Did it take your merge and your ticket 
sales company that doesn't have anything

3746
02:42:21,661 --> 02:42:25,600
to do with you performing,
they take a piece of you performed this?

3747
02:42:25,890 --> 02:42:26,723
Yes.
And these things that like things are 

3748
02:42:28,711 --> 02:42:30,120
offered to me and I'm like,
Yo man,

3749
02:42:30,121 --> 02:42:33,150
I spent my entire life building this and
you,

3750
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:39,020
you want a piece of the pie that I baked
for no reason I'll share with anybody,

3751
02:42:39,841 --> 02:42:43,050
but what's the reason for it?
But you got to be offering something,

3752
02:42:43,310 --> 02:42:44,650
bring something to the table.
They're,

3753
02:42:45,570 --> 02:42:47,190
they're not bringing anything to the 
table.

3754
02:42:47,191 --> 02:42:48,870
What are they saying that we can make 
you bigger?

3755
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:51,220
We'll get you on the radio,
which nobody listens to anymore.

3756
02:42:51,280 --> 02:42:53,610
Like what are they saying right now?
This is the radio,

3757
02:42:53,870 --> 02:42:55,350
not me.
Is there any.

3758
02:42:55,560 --> 02:42:56,393
What is,
is there a big radio station these days 

3759
02:42:59,251 --> 02:43:00,200
that anybody listens to?

3760
02:43:00,340 --> 02:43:02,100
Not that I'm aware of.
I mean,

3761
02:43:02,101 --> 02:43:05,850
I know they still exist.
I know that hot 97 still in New York,

3762
02:43:05,851 --> 02:43:06,684
but I don't have anyone listens to it.
But where the kids find out about music 

3763
02:43:09,121 --> 02:43:10,860
now it's got to be through the Internet.
It's there.

3764
02:43:10,880 --> 02:43:12,740
The interwebs.
Uh,

3765
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:18,030
I asked the kid,
a young barber was cutting me and he was

3766
02:43:18,980 --> 02:43:19,870
like,
what do you do?

3767
02:43:19,950 --> 02:43:24,950
You musicians like casually got into it.
And I was just making conversation,

3768
02:43:25,541 --> 02:43:27,010
I was like,
how do you listen to music?

3769
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:30,820
He was like spotify,
apple music and soundcloud.

3770
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:31,870
And I was like,
okay.

3771
02:43:31,871 --> 02:43:34,200
I don't use any of the three of them,
but yeah.

3772
02:43:34,450 --> 02:43:36,100
But it's good to know,
you know what I mean?

3773
02:43:36,101 --> 02:43:36,934
It's like

3774
02:43:37,330 --> 02:43:38,400
it's who,

3775
02:43:39,500 --> 02:43:40,620
uh,
like I listened.

3776
02:43:40,710 --> 02:43:43,950
I have your podcast on like in a podcast
app on my phone,

3777
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:46,080
you know what I mean?
And I'm assuming that's what people do.

3778
02:43:46,830 --> 02:43:48,990
It's a little bit easier to track I 
suppose.

3779
02:43:48,991 --> 02:43:49,824
But again,
it's like the Peter Frampton and David 

3780
02:43:54,811 --> 02:43:55,940
crosby thing.
Like I said,

3781
02:43:56,230 --> 02:44:01,230
it was some number that's outlandish,
like 200 million streams or something.

3782
02:44:02,050 --> 02:44:04,140
Any 50 bucks.
Like how,

3783
02:44:04,290 --> 02:44:07,140
how is that criminals,
how is it legal?

3784
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:08,560
It shouldn't be.
They,

3785
02:44:08,561 --> 02:44:09,394
they rigged the system they have.
Did they have to figure out a way to 

3786
02:44:11,371 --> 02:44:12,204
quantify it the same way?
Record sales would have been like when 

3787
02:44:13,980 --> 02:44:16,830
we went to the fucking store,
when we went to tower records of the mom

3788
02:44:16,831 --> 02:44:18,670
and pop store or whatever it goes.
That's it.

3789
02:44:18,710 --> 02:44:23,470
Recent numbers per scream.
Napster was rhapsody zero point zero,

3790
02:44:23,471 --> 02:44:25,570
one nine titles,
zero point zero,

3791
02:44:25,571 --> 02:44:25,901
one,
two,

3792
02:44:25,901 --> 02:44:26,734
five apple music.
So you get your song played a million 

3793
02:44:30,431 --> 02:44:33,850
times and get less than $5.
Seems Fair.

3794
02:44:34,630 --> 02:44:36,970
He said that's fucking insane.

3795
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:39,670
Million streams.
You get less than five clams.

3796
02:44:39,671 --> 02:44:40,160
Man,

3797
02:44:40,160 --> 02:44:43,310
that is insane.
It's so small.

3798
02:44:43,570 --> 02:44:48,170
Is Youtube zero point zero,
zero zero six nine.

3799
02:44:49,340 --> 02:44:51,050
Is that.
What is that?

3800
02:44:51,051 --> 02:44:52,250
What is that?
What is that?

3801
02:44:53,450 --> 02:44:58,450
That's fucking insane.
One hundred 60 $900,000.

3802
02:44:59,800 --> 02:45:01,100
100.
That's a hard word to say.

3803
02:45:01,101 --> 02:45:03,140
100 thousandths of a dollar.

3804
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:07,410
Can you even quantify that as money at 
that point?

3805
02:45:07,590 --> 02:45:10,650
What?
What does anyone do when they.

3806
02:45:11,130 --> 02:45:11,963
They're faced with this sort of 
information like is anything going to 

3807
02:45:15,991 --> 02:45:18,660
change and if it does change,
what are they going to double it?

3808
02:45:19,530 --> 02:45:21,890
That's what I mean.
That's 10 bucks.

3809
02:45:21,920 --> 02:45:22,753
That's my worry that it's being brought 
to people's attention and it might go 

3810
02:45:25,491 --> 02:45:26,324
to,
you know,

3811
02:45:26,330 --> 02:45:30,620
the big government might get involved 
and how much is that going to shift?

3812
02:45:30,780 --> 02:45:35,580
Right?
Well the artists can't pull the music.

3813
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:37,890
The music is owned by the record 
companies.

3814
02:45:38,250 --> 02:45:40,800
The record companies are going to play 
it and they're not going to pay them the

3815
02:45:40,801 --> 02:45:43,440
same.
They would pay someone who is buying it.

3816
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:44,313
Right.
I know Taylor swift pulled her shit for 

3817
02:45:45,921 --> 02:45:49,430
a minute on some making a stance,
but however it was rectified,

3818
02:45:49,730 --> 02:45:50,563
she put it back.

3819
02:45:50,640 --> 02:45:53,040
I gave her money probably.
I'm sure they gave her money.

3820
02:45:53,070 --> 02:45:54,390
Yeah.
They give people money.

3821
02:45:54,870 --> 02:45:56,730
They're giving people money for podcasts
too.

3822
02:45:56,731 --> 02:46:00,610
They give you money for like exclusive 
use of it for a couple days like that,

3823
02:46:00,620 --> 02:46:01,453
but like for two days or something along
those lines or they want to put their 

3824
02:46:04,891 --> 02:46:06,570
own ads on it.
Those lines.

3825
02:46:06,571 --> 02:46:09,980
But people can get your podcasts.
You don't need

3826
02:46:09,980 --> 02:46:10,940
to do that.
Oh Man.

3827
02:46:10,941 --> 02:46:14,480
You just letting someone make some money
off you for no reason.

3828
02:46:14,481 --> 02:46:15,980
Absolutely.
Absolutely,

3829
02:46:15,981 --> 02:46:19,040
and will end what we do.
It's like we control our shit.

3830
02:46:19,041 --> 02:46:21,050
Why would we give that up?
Yeah.

3831
02:46:21,170 --> 02:46:23,240
Tell me why.
That's what they needed to tell me.

3832
02:46:23,241 --> 02:46:24,890
Why I would give up control of my shit 
too.

3833
02:46:24,900 --> 02:46:27,100
You can't.
You can't.

3834
02:46:27,140 --> 02:46:27,973
There's no logical explanation unless 
we're talking fucking money and y'all 

3835
02:46:30,411 --> 02:46:32,480
ain't turn on your music.
You see,

3836
02:46:32,481 --> 02:46:34,340
that's nice.
That's nice.

3837
02:46:34,341 --> 02:46:35,900
And there's not a lot of people that can
say that.

3838
02:46:35,920 --> 02:46:37,790
No,
because you know,

3839
02:46:38,510 --> 02:46:40,280
you know,
when you sign with a major they own your

3840
02:46:40,281 --> 02:46:42,440
masters.
So it's like you can't do it,

3841
02:46:42,441 --> 02:46:43,370
you know,
if I want to,

3842
02:46:44,490 --> 02:46:48,830
you know,
an album of mine that came out in 2010,

3843
02:46:48,890 --> 02:46:49,723
say 20 slash 20,
I want to do a 10th anniversary edition 

3844
02:46:52,641 --> 02:46:55,160
on Blue Vinyl and all that kind of cool 
shit.

3845
02:46:55,520 --> 02:46:58,590
I can I ask anybody?
Right.

3846
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:00,193
It's like direct to consumer ship is 
basically what I'm doing and my merged 

3847
02:47:03,291 --> 02:47:05,060
companies run,
you know,

3848
02:47:05,090 --> 02:47:08,910
I try to do that as much as possible 
because I'm,

3849
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:13,060
that diy aesthetic is important to me.
You know what I mean?

3850
02:47:13,220 --> 02:47:15,500
It's,
you know,

3851
02:47:15,560 --> 02:47:18,170
we grew up with people and that they 
seemed untouchable,

3852
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:22,620
you know,
Rockstar Shit,

3853
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:24,740
superheroes,
you know what I mean?

3854
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:27,920
I would like to sort of bridge that gap 
where it's like,

3855
02:47:27,921 --> 02:47:29,210
no,
I'll come up and say what's up man?

3856
02:47:29,530 --> 02:47:31,160
You know what I mean?
Let's talk.

3857
02:47:31,161 --> 02:47:32,260
How are you,
you know,

3858
02:47:32,540 --> 02:47:33,373
what your name.
Do you still sell actual physical cds 

3859
02:47:37,941 --> 02:47:38,571
anymore?
Yeah,

3860
02:47:38,571 --> 02:47:41,090
we do.
Because there's a niche audience man,

3861
02:47:41,091 --> 02:47:43,990
that like how many people buy them is 
that.

3862
02:47:44,920 --> 02:47:46,100
It's like,
well,

3863
02:47:46,101 --> 02:47:47,390
see,
I press vinyl.

3864
02:47:47,450 --> 02:47:50,500
I press tapes before,
but just to be,

3865
02:47:50,740 --> 02:47:53,720
just to be cute.
Could be cute.

3866
02:47:53,720 --> 02:47:55,070
Joseph.
Uh,

3867
02:47:55,420 --> 02:47:56,810
yeah.
Tapes,

3868
02:47:56,811 --> 02:48:01,580
vinyl CDs and Vinyl sells the most love 
vinyl.

3869
02:48:01,581 --> 02:48:02,180
Yes.
Right.

3870
02:48:02,180 --> 02:48:03,530
Yeah.
It's a big,

3871
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:08,450
big comeback.
Cds still that they're the most honestly

3872
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:11,400
right now today tapes are more popular 
than CDS.

3873
02:48:12,660 --> 02:48:15,110
Like a nostalgia thing and it'll 
probably go away,

3874
02:48:15,620 --> 02:48:18,020
but like we discussed,
not even pressing them.

3875
02:48:18,260 --> 02:48:19,110
Wow.
Yeah.

3876
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:21,860
Like that's how much I did because I'm 
old school,

3877
02:48:22,190 --> 02:48:26,630
but we discussed like not doing it,
but vinyl still coming in strong.

3878
02:48:27,550 --> 02:48:30,110
You buy into the sound difference.
I do,

3879
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:30,980
yeah.
Yeah.

3880
02:48:30,980 --> 02:48:34,790
Yeah.
But I buy into it with first you have to

3881
02:48:34,791 --> 02:48:38,960
start at the source,
like if it's recorded amazingly,

3882
02:48:38,961 --> 02:48:41,300
then if it sounds Shitty,
it's gonna Sound Shitty.

3883
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:44,270
I'd rather listen to the Beatles on 
vinyl.

3884
02:48:44,350 --> 02:48:45,260
I ran,
listen to.

3885
02:48:45,520 --> 02:48:48,080
I listen to thin lizzy on vinyl,
metal,

3886
02:48:48,081 --> 02:48:49,350
stuff like that.
I mean a lot of,

3887
02:48:49,700 --> 02:48:50,870
a lot of hip hop shit.

3888
02:48:50,900 --> 02:48:51,733
You know,
kids have a mic and a laptop in the 

3889
02:48:55,311 --> 02:48:58,250
bedroom and that's the,
that's the recording studio.

3890
02:48:58,890 --> 02:49:01,340
That's not gonna make any fucking 
difference is going to be what it is,

3891
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:03,590
you know what I mean?
But bands through care.

3892
02:49:03,591 --> 02:49:04,360
I,
I,

3893
02:49:04,360 --> 02:49:05,480
it's,
it's warmer.

3894
02:49:05,481 --> 02:49:07,860
Like if I listen to stevie wonder 
records said warmer.

3895
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:09,150
Warmer.
Yeah.

3896
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:10,980
Yeah.
I've heard that expression before.

3897
02:49:11,400 --> 02:49:13,080
I don't know really how to articulate 
it,

3898
02:49:13,081 --> 02:49:16,680
but in my head I know what it means.
Just the baselines and drums.

3899
02:49:17,220 --> 02:49:20,640
Everything sounds warm to me.
Can they replicate that?

3900
02:49:21,220 --> 02:49:23,100
It was impossible.
Some people can.

3901
02:49:23,650 --> 02:49:27,890
With electronics to a degree,
you still need to.

3902
02:49:28,350 --> 02:49:30,630
You still need to get analog to a 
degree.

3903
02:49:30,631 --> 02:49:31,464
You know what I mean?
There's still a few studios in the 

3904
02:49:32,581 --> 02:49:36,450
country that do shit on reel to reel 
because that sound,

3905
02:49:36,451 --> 02:49:39,060
you can't,
you can't have a fully replicated.

3906
02:49:39,060 --> 02:49:39,893
You can get close,
but you need to go to a reel to real to 

3907
02:49:42,001 --> 02:49:43,730
really get that.
You know,

3908
02:49:44,760 --> 02:49:46,290
we loved.
Yeah.

3909
02:49:46,950 --> 02:49:51,030
Now what about like apple music and 
people buying things on itunes?

3910
02:49:51,090 --> 02:49:53,010
It's like that.
People still do that,

3911
02:49:53,011 --> 02:49:53,821
right?
Yeah.

3912
02:49:53,821 --> 02:49:55,370
But that's dropping too.
Yeah,

3913
02:49:55,410 --> 02:49:56,020
yeah,
it's,

3914
02:49:56,020 --> 02:49:59,040
it's streaming,
it's soul stream dominated,

3915
02:49:59,070 --> 02:49:59,903
you know,
because even when people were doing 

3916
02:50:00,451 --> 02:50:02,340
that,
like buying albums on itunes,

3917
02:50:02,341 --> 02:50:06,120
buying albums digitally on Amazon or 
whatever,

3918
02:50:06,500 --> 02:50:09,150
someone's preferences.
It was sweet.

3919
02:50:09,270 --> 02:50:10,560
It was good,
good money,

3920
02:50:10,561 --> 02:50:12,570
all of that.
And then the streaming shit like.

3921
02:50:12,920 --> 02:50:13,753
Because logically if you're a casual 
music fan and you pay $10 a month for 

3922
02:50:17,101 --> 02:50:19,590
spotify for every album that's ever been
recorded,

3923
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:22,590
can you really blame the van?
You know what I mean?

3924
02:50:22,591 --> 02:50:25,890
And their ways of the ways of ingesting 
music is so different.

3925
02:50:25,891 --> 02:50:28,110
Like I love the opening the vinyl.

3926
02:50:28,110 --> 02:50:31,980
I love reading the thank yous.
I love the smell of the fucking cassette

3927
02:50:31,981 --> 02:50:32,814
tape.
I loved it was an experience going to 

3928
02:50:34,501 --> 02:50:35,334
the store,
being on the bus with the headphones on 

3929
02:50:37,530 --> 02:50:40,770
the first time you hear it,
know I can tell you where I was when I,

3930
02:50:41,070 --> 02:50:44,230
when I bought nozzle nomadic,
where I can tell you all that.

3931
02:50:44,520 --> 02:50:48,120
That's the experience that it's,
you know,

3932
02:50:48,121 --> 02:50:49,980
boom,
Bhangra and now I have the album.

3933
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:52,110
You didn't comment.
I got the new Joe Rogan album,

3934
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:55,710
two seconds with a click.
That's a weird thing to me.

3935
02:50:56,360 --> 02:50:56,970
You know what I mean?
It's,

3936
02:50:56,970 --> 02:50:57,803
I guess it's not weird to them,
but the little stores you would go to 

3937
02:51:00,030 --> 02:51:00,863
where there was little stations where 
you could press a button and listen 

3938
02:51:03,530 --> 02:51:05,910
preview of all these different and 
people just stand there all day,

3939
02:51:05,911 --> 02:51:09,210
all day listening to music all day,
get it,

3940
02:51:09,300 --> 02:51:10,133
and if they didn't have them,
you were buying shit and guessing many 

3941
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:16,590
bad bad shit.
I was looking at cool album.

3942
02:51:18,690 --> 02:51:19,523
I bought out album,
like metal albums with a bad ass 

3943
02:51:22,170 --> 02:51:24,850
covering the band was just terrible.
You know what I mean?

3944
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:26,940
You see sugar man.
Yes.

3945
02:51:27,030 --> 02:51:31,410
How crazy is that mother fucking crate.
I don't know what's crazier at the story

3946
02:51:31,710 --> 02:51:35,640
or that he got big in Africa batshit.
That movie made me cry.

3947
02:51:35,700 --> 02:51:37,310
I've been me too bad shit.
Crazy,

3948
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:38,183
but just how insane that this guy went 
on to become like a laborer for a 

3949
02:51:42,541 --> 02:51:43,374
construction company.
Had no idea that he was a superstar in 

3950
02:51:45,481 --> 02:51:46,620
Africa.
Insane.

3951
02:51:46,860 --> 02:51:47,693
And then goes there as an older man to 
sold out stadium and they all know the 

3952
02:51:51,691 --> 02:51:53,340
words.
It's beautiful man.

3953
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:54,773
That is one of the craziest 
documentaries our time searching for 

3954
02:51:57,751 --> 02:51:58,201
sugar,
man,

3955
02:51:58,201 --> 02:51:59,700
if you haven't seen it folks.
Yes.

3956
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:01,050
He got to see it.
It's brilliant.

3957
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:03,960
Well done.
And that's a different era too.

3958
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:06,090
You know,
that guy gave all his money when I

3959
02:52:06,210 --> 02:52:10,840
do this is the real fucking deal or no 
fucking joke,

3960
02:52:10,841 --> 02:52:14,470
man.
I mean he still lives like he lived when

3961
02:52:14,471 --> 02:52:18,220
he was a poor construction worker.
Whoa.

3962
02:52:18,250 --> 02:52:20,750
It's elevated Lao elevated way of 
thinking.

3963
02:52:21,040 --> 02:52:21,873
Yeah,
I think he just got so used to being in 

3964
02:52:23,511 --> 02:52:27,280
that space for so long and his fucking 
music is good.

3965
02:52:27,281 --> 02:52:29,240
It's really good.
It's really good.

3966
02:52:29,540 --> 02:52:32,720
I think sometimes man,
like when that's brought on you,

3967
02:52:33,470 --> 02:52:35,420
you're still more comfortable in that 
other way,

3968
02:52:36,230 --> 02:52:37,940
you know,
some people don't want to.

3969
02:52:39,950 --> 02:52:42,450
They're not comfortable embracing that,
you know,

3970
02:52:42,470 --> 02:52:46,070
whether it's wealth or fame or a mixture
of both.

3971
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:50,090
I just think he was like,
I'm good content.

3972
02:52:50,140 --> 02:52:53,030
And there's people with billions that 
aren't content,

3973
02:52:53,210 --> 02:52:54,043
which there's nothing more important 
than being good with yourself and he 

3974
02:52:56,571 --> 02:52:58,370
seems good with himself.
Yeah.

3975
02:52:58,371 --> 02:52:59,204
That is one of the scarier things.
As someone who insanely successful but 

3976
02:53:02,661 --> 02:53:05,330
never satisfied,
I think a lot of people are like.

3977
02:53:05,331 --> 02:53:07,250
That was one of the things I was saying 
about trump,

3978
02:53:07,640 --> 02:53:11,450
like if you are 70 years old and you 
have billions of dollars,

3979
02:53:11,690 --> 02:53:14,650
why are you still working?
Yes.

3980
02:53:14,750 --> 02:53:15,583
What do you do?
You think something's going to change 

3981
02:53:16,911 --> 02:53:18,320
and you're going to live forever,
right?

3982
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:19,263
Do you have no perception that you 
literally on the last finger full of 

3983
02:53:24,051 --> 02:53:24,884
Greens in your hourglass,
it's all you got left and you're not 

3984
02:53:27,771 --> 02:53:29,890
spending it on a yacht and occupied.

3985
02:53:30,530 --> 02:53:33,890
Getting your Dick sucked to big pimpin 
in the background.

3986
02:53:34,190 --> 02:53:37,490
What's the.
What's the mechanism in his head?

3987
02:53:37,491 --> 02:53:38,324
It's this drive ennis.
I know that I think about like that 

3988
02:53:41,181 --> 02:53:42,710
about Warren Buffet.
Yeah,

3989
02:53:42,770 --> 02:53:44,030
right.
Because that keeps you going.

3990
02:53:44,031 --> 02:53:44,864
He was like 409 years old with no,
I don't even know how much money and 

3991
02:53:48,120 --> 02:53:51,410
he's a real weird one because he still
