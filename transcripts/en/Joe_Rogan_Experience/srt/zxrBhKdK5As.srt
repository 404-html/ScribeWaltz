1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,490
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:03,820
The other,

3
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:04,920
another experience I had,

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:05,840
I've had in recent years,

5
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:07,890
it led me to not want
to engage in this is,

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,990
is walking around various events
in sort of breakout things,

7
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,380
see people who,

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,233
you know,

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,750
we need people I've admired in the
past all saying things like you,

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,010
you see that as you see
I flamed x on Twitter.

11
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:25,160
I do you see what I
tweeted about that person?

12
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:25,890
I,

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,890
I think these used to be serious people
and these used to be serious people

14
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:36,801
engaged in serious things and here they
are engaged in these full flailing fist

15
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:40,740
fights and often,

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,720
often let's face it on things,

17
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:44,880
which if you didn't do it like that,

18
00:00:44,881 --> 00:00:48,660
seeking out the fight are the sort of
thing that would allow for normal human

19
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,320
interaction.

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,860
I mean how many disagreements that we
have with people in our personal lives all

21
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:53,220
the time.

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,150
If we wanted to,

23
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,110
uh,

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,700
you didn't vote this way that way.

25
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:57,960
I mean some people would mind about that.

26
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:58,261
But you know,

27
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:58,620
I,

28
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,051
I know you've,

29
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,560
you think slightly differently
from me on this particular issue.

30
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,010
You,

31
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,800
you don't say let's have that
out now once and for all you,

32
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,220
um,

33
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:08,441
you,

34
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,600
you find ways to live with,

35
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,060
with difference and different
opinions and you know,

36
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:12,630
I mean,

37
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,880
you're not going to get
everyone exactly in line.

38
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,210
I mean,

39
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,470
we all knew that before the age of social
media and now it seems to be the only

40
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,304
aim.

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,540
What do you think that is?

42
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,000
It,

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,550
I mean think it's what we
were discussing earlier,

44
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:27,060
that it's idea sport and then you just
get caught up and like someone volleyed

45
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:30,120
your way and so you have to smash that
tennis ball back there where it is.

46
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,990
Something like that.

47
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,261
I mean,

48
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:31,560
I,

49
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,220
I can't say I haven't felt the vicarious
pleasure of some of that myself,

50
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:35,410
you know,

51
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,180
so that old Chinese proverb
about sitting by the river,

52
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,310
watching the bodies of
your enemies float by.

53
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,733
Um,

54
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,670
I had a big sense of that the other day
when somebody I deeply disliked came

55
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,310
across her on social media at the same
time as somebody else I deeply dislike

56
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,960
was being held by the French
police on serious charges.

57
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,794
And I thought that was a,

58
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
I felt like the Chinese proverb.

59
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,993
That's all right.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,390
And so I,

61
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:00,840
I can,

62
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,220
I can see why people feel it.

63
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:02,740
Sure.

64
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,480
Um,

65
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,480
and of course people who they could
never normally get to who they've got to.

66
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,661
I mean,

67
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:10,170
I think that's,

68
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,070
I think that's the big,

69
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,904
uh,

70
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,140
the big thing of,

71
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,610
you know,

72
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:13,951
look,

73
00:02:13,951 --> 00:02:14,910
I poked that.

74
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,013
You know what?

75
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,493
Yeah,

76
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,460
they never engage on social
media for precisely that reason,

77
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,000
that reason of my others
that you would never,

78
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:26,520
I would never want somebody
to know they could get to me,

79
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,451
even if they,

80
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,950
even if you just block them,

81
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,250
there's many people who take
pride even in their heading,

82
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:32,941
they say,

83
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:35,460
I am blocked on Twitter
by all these people.

84
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,970
And,

85
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,700
and actually I do sometimes
read what people say,

86
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,593
send to me.

87
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,090
Um,

88
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,510
and I've never blocked anyone because
I sort of think you should mind,

89
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,980
is that if you put your ideas out there,

90
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:46,140
you might as well be as open as
possible to receiving them back.

91
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,550
Some time ago when I got into a vow with,

92
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,433
uh,

93
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,720
with the Turkish president about,

94
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,860
about something,

95
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,270
uh,

96
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,540
I got all these Turkish,

97
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,360
a sort of accounts sending me stuff.

98
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:56,881
There was one guy,

99
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,230
he just repeated these sent me,

100
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:58,990
uh,

101
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,330
pornography of animals

102
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,850
having sex with,

103
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,141
so I don't know,

104
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:03,460
it just,

105
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:03,981
it was very,

106
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:06,230
it was very hard core and um,

107
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,210
and so I used to go down the feet.

108
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:08,720
Now that gun,

109
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,150
I didn't even block him actually
because I sort of thought,

110
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:11,720
well,

111
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,010
somewhere in Turkey,

112
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,620
he's a really angry man,

113
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,420
desperately finding
horse pornography send,

114
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,263
sending to me.

115
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,670
And in a way I felt so sorry for him
that that was how his life had Karma,

116
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,071
the end,

117
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:26,630
his life and come to at this stage that I,

118
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,070
I couldn't even block him.

119
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,090
And also he'd be like,

120
00:03:29,091 --> 00:03:32,330
I'm the donkey porn guy
who got blocked by dog.

121
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,850
He'd get a certain fame.

122
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,640
Do you think that they're just
caught up in this sexy thing?

123
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,120
Yes.

124
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,380
A lot of it is sensationalism.

125
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,410
It's also what the public is
really focused on right now.

126
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:45,880
So it's something that gathers ratings.

127
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,440
I think they're driving it.

128
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,780
I think it's driven from the top down,

129
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:50,980
from the establishment media Dow,

130
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,060
from the Democrats down.

131
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:52,960
Because again,

132
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,430
if you talk to regular people,

133
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:55,780
they're fucking hurting,

134
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:56,500
right?

135
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,150
We just have been stagnant since 1980
there's 30 million people that don't have

136
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,580
healthcare in Trump's
first year in office,

137
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,630
3 million more people lost healthcare
because he did all these executive orders

138
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:10,030
that basically took a
hatchet to Obamacare.

139
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,950
So you have all these people
who are really hurting their,

140
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,020
they care about their wages.

141
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:14,740
They care about,

142
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,011
you know,

143
00:04:15,011 --> 00:04:17,980
not being saddled with over a
trillion dollars in student loan debt.

144
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,080
This is the shit regular
people care about.

145
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,930
So if when they turn on
CNN and they see Russia,

146
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:23,201
Russia,

147
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,034
Russia,

148
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,150
even if you don't like Trump,

149
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,490
I despise Trump with every
fiber of my fucking mean.

150
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,181
But when I see this,

151
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,700
I wrote my fucking eyes and
then they have the nerve to say,

152
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,121
oh,

153
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:32,440
Trump won't shut up about Russia.

154
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,280
You were talking about her all day
and he responded to it and because he

155
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,450
responds it to it,

156
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:37,871
you're like,

157
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:38,200
oh,

158
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,430
there he goes again with Russia.

159
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,800
Yeah,

160
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,030
it's going to be interesting
to see how this all plays out.

161
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,810
I'm really fascinated and I'm fascinated
to see if he can make it out of four

162
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:47,500
years.

163
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,190
Well not only,

164
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,450
well I think he's going to,

165
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,500
do you think he's gonna run my thing?

166
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,270
He's gonna run again and
he's going to win again.

167
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,200
He has a chance.

168
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,390
He has a fucking chance
because the Democrats,

169
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,160
if the Democrats run Kamala Harris,

170
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,940
if they run Cory booker or any of the
other corporatists he can win because he's

171
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,000
going to go right back into his tap
dance about being a populous and helping

172
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:04,600
people.

173
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,261
And guess what?

174
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,910
In the first few years of his tax bill,

175
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,440
regular people did get a tax cut.

176
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,191
So he's going to say,

177
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:09,350
look,

178
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,630
you look at your tax bill.

179
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:12,790
I just gave you an extra
thousand dollars this year.

180
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,624
Who you want to vote for?

181
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,780
And so there is an argument that
he's going to make to the people.

182
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,990
And if you don't have somebody like
Bernie Sanders or Bernie Sanders talking

183
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:25,840
about the issues that matter to people
will then of course he can fucking win

184
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,350
again.

185
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,620
Listen there,

186
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,510
there was,

187
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,120
I was laughed at when I said,

188
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,530
if it's Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton,

189
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,513
he can win.

190
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,353
People laughed at me.

191
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,490
We have a soft life now.

192
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,960
So there's Gunna be a lot of
people that are ridiculous.

193
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:42,063
And you know,

194
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,390
there's always been those people that are
weak willed and they want the world to

195
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,210
be nerved up and of
course pad their feelings.

196
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,501
You're,

197
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:50,470
you're going to have that.

198
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,370
But there's also more people that
have an understanding of like,

199
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,320
that's not a happy,

200
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,590
healthy way to live your life.

201
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,040
And I also think that like reality at
some point will always supersede nerf

202
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,350
padding.

203
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:04,731
You know,

204
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,130
there's always going to be a push
back on that where you go look like,

205
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,020
I don't want to offend anybody,

206
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,650
but like,

207
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:09,831
you know,

208
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:13,610
and I do agree that like
there's a movement by the
left that really does push,

209
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:14,850
you know,

210
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,260
I was,

211
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:15,861
I did a thing,

212
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:16,070
reason.

213
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,690
I'm doing this a charity event,

214
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,673
um,

215
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,663
for uh,

216
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,910
like an urban program for kids.

217
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,930
Um,

218
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,780
mainly inner city black kids
and I'm hosting it with my,

219
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,080
uh,

220
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,950
my buddy Mike Yard.

221
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:31,820
He's a really funny comic black dude and
we went to meet with the guys for this

222
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,230
charity and they were telling us that,

223
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,064
uh,

224
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,090
you know,

225
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,110
they have an auction,

226
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,790
like any charity event,

227
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:37,970
right?

228
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,460
An auctioneer comes out and they all try
to auction off and raise a lot of money

229
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:41,870
from rich people to help the program.

230
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,880
That's a very basically 99.9% of every
charity event I've ever been involved.

231
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:48,920
This has an auction segment in the dinner.

232
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,953
Right.

233
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,750
They were like,

234
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,620
we're going to have that,

235
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:53,120
but we can't use the word auction.

236
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,381
I said,

237
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:54,600
what?

238
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,670
What do you mean you can't
use the word auction?

239
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:57,504
Don't like,

240
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,800
it's a sensitive word for,

241
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,580
you know the community.

242
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,360
I was like,

243
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,260
and then yard goes,

244
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,640
are you talking about slave?

245
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,380
It's like kids head office six flood.

246
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,550
He was like,

247
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,730
wait,

248
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,350
we can,

249
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,711
and I was like,

250
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:09,861
wait,

251
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:11,240
we can't say the word auction.

252
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:11,841
I'm like,

253
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:13,430
but aren't you hiring
a guy from Southerby's?

254
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,293
Yeah,

255
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,390
his card's going to say auctioneer on it.

256
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,560
We're just going to pretend
that's not what he's called.

257
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,491
And they were just like,

258
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,740
we just don't feel comfortable
with that word in the room.

259
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,121
And I was just going to,

260
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,940
I can't see,

261
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,291
I said,

262
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:24,561
guys,

263
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:25,270
I got to tell you,

264
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,590
like you're making me
want to vote for Trump.

265
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,513
That's what I said.

266
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,570
I said,

267
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,920
that's how dumb I think this is.

268
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:41,200
Okay.
