1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,230
Amy Young,
Jimmy,

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:05,820
fix this fucking mess we have here.
Electronics fail folks.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,150
They just,
they judge do sometimes they just go bad

4
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:10,130
on you.
They just feel,

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,530
that's why people like mechanical shit,
like cars with a collage,

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,540
they fail to,
they fail to.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,730
He did three boards,
three boards.

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,730
Young Jamie had a fire through a bunch
of shit we have laying around.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,850
Luckily we almost have enough.
If you're listening to this,

10
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,260
you're like,
this is in mono.

11
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:30,330
It's not even in Stereo.
Is it?

12
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,330
Stairs like mine.
Now I'm going to sound like shit.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,550
Well you're in like one ear only.
What?

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,470
I can only get us to one from what I own
over here.

15
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,370
How do you sound to the regular people?
I'll fix it later.

16
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:43,770
I think it should be just fine,
but for right now I'm only going to be

17
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,360
left here.
Well,

18
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,210
if anybody's listening to the youtube on
headphones,

19
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,360
that means you're probably at work and
you fucking off.

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,940
So that's what happens.
He's definitely not working.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,050
Do you know how many people listen to
podcasts while they're working and don't

22
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,230
really work?
Do you know how many people messaged me

23
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:05,610
about how they're doing something pretty
dangerous and they're sitting there like

24
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm doing fork lifts and moving shit
around,

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,140
but I'm laughing,
listening.

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,510
Really comforting man.
But at least they're,

27
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:16,110
well if you work at forklift you really
need to listen to people.

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,450
No,
I guess not have those headsets on it

29
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:21,060
and we'll have a good laugh.
I think a lot of them say they have a

30
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,750
policies where someone will tell them,
hey one ear free,

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,510
you know,
so that you can hear someone screaming

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,460
my legs under this thing right now.
You know,

33
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,740
that kind of shit.
Isn't that the rule when you drive him?

34
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,770
Like you're not allowed to have like
full headsets on as supposed to yeah.

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,170
You can have one in I guess you can.
You definitely,

36
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:39,600
yeah.
Legally drive.

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,610
I don't know.
Legally I'm guessing.

38
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,890
What am I a lawyer?
Yeah,

39
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,990
it'd be a great lawyer.
Thank you.

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,700
That would,
I would fucking argue to the end.

41
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,460
I think if you became a lawyer and you
were arguing all the time,

42
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:51,840
you'd probably be a nightmare to be
around.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,780
Cause you probably always trying to win.
Oh for sure.

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,970
That's what they do,
right,

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,590
is what they do.
Find their way out of technicalities.

47
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,040
You're a shrink too and you're,
you know,

48
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,600
every,
every conversation you get in,

49
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,520
are you psychoanalyzing everybody
probably,

50
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,810
right?
Yes,

51
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,120
for sure.
That's got to wear out on you other

52
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,880
people for Awhile.
Like will you knock it the fuck off?

53
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,310
Yeah.
Well when I was in college that was the

54
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,760
area.
I'm never really applied myself at

55
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,610
college at all.

56
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,110
But the one thing that I was thinking
of,

57
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:21,030
like if I had a job,
like what,

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,290
what are things that I'm interested in?
Psychology did come up because I'd read

59
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:29,340
a lot of like self help books and
psychology books while I was fighting to

60
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,940
try to like manage my mind and anxiety
and shit like that.

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,100
But then I thought about it,
I'd be like,

62
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,040
you just be dealing with people with
problems all the time and you don't,

63
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,400
I don't necessarily want that.
I don't,

64
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,110
I don't think that's a good idea.
Just make you dicks off.

65
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:48,640
That's why.
Yeah.

66
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,760
Yeah.
When someone tells you their problems.

67
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,240
I always feel like if you tell me your
problems,

68
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,550
you're making my Dick's off problems
make you dig stuff.

69
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,700
I've never,
well,

70
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,810
I always felt like that when I was
dating.

71
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,490
You know?
It's like,

72
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,510
oh,
the girl,

73
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,230
she starts telling you problems.
You're like,

74
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,280
man,
you're making that ticks off.

75
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,690
Right.
Depends on what the problems are.

76
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,610
The problems are they ex boyfriend?
He just never wanted to eat my pussy.

77
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:13,040
I don't know.
That's a good problem.

78
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,280
That's a problem.
That makes it the car,

79
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,190
Babe.
We got solutions.

80
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:22,360
We've got solutions for this problem.
Problems,

81
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,820
mathematics.
I've never heard that before.

82
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,260
Thank you.
But now

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,470
that's an original problems.
Make my Dick Stop.

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,000
You should make a song.
I've written a few lyrics.

85
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,470
I really have.
What does it wrap or the way that I had

86
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:44,050
it written out is that it's one of those
songs that starts with banter between

87
00:03:44,051 --> 00:03:47,560
like the piano player and the guy on the
mic and he's like,

88
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,570
yeah,
you know,

89
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,880
hey joe,
how'd it go last night?

90
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,450
He's like,
ah,

91
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,620
man.
You know,

92
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,680
she came over,
but you know there's nothing I hate.

93
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,750
Listen,
I hate more than proud was right.

94
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,680
Aww.
Yeah man.

95
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:01,150
Then you hear a little sprinkle of the
piano,

96
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,930
you'll problems make my dick so dick.
So that can actually be a funny song.

97
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,100
I think so.
Yeah.

98
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:09,851
Definitely.
Yeah.

99
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:12,220
You seen the team up with somebody?
Yeah.

100
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:16,060
Well that's a sure sign that someone is
not really into turning you on.

101
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,340
Yes.
They get together with you and then just

102
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,080
start whining and complaining.
Exactly.

103
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,330
Get your freak on.
Especially if it's early on and you're

104
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,560
wondering,
you're like,

105
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,420
I don't know where we stand.
And they start,

106
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,750
if it's a girl is downloading the
problems,

107
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,450
she's not interested in that deck at all
or she's just so into herself that you

108
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:36,370
just got to get out of there anyway.
Yeah.

109
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,930
Time to bail.
Yeah.

110
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,720
Because when you tell someone about your
problems,

111
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,400
aren't you thinking while you're telling
them like,

112
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,830
I don't want to fucking burden this guy
with my problems.

113
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,120
Right?
Yes.

114
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:49,330
So when someone doesn't think like that,
they're very self obsessed.

115
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,310
That's just thinking about themselves.
That's true.

116
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,590
And I told her,
I can fuck you.

117
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:57,140
You fucking,
he only my boss because you're

118
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,830
okay.
Yeah,

119
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,040
yeah,
yeah.

120
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,120
Then you're like,
look,

121
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,700
I made a souffle.
What's up are going to do,

122
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,480
especially at work problems when people
start talking about work bullshit,

123
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,490
like you're not even there.
You have it.

124
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,310
That when you go on a,
you know,

125
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,660
double date,
real life and then they start telling

126
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:18,661
you about Sarah and accounting or
something and your dude double dates can

127
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:22,600
be fucking rude.
All and especially the ones my wife

128
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:23,240
wants to set setup.

129
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,480
Can I leave me leave to meet my husband?

130
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:32,260
They don't realize you're your
conditioned pretty much fully to

131
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,270
interesting people.
Your,

132
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,700
you know,
your host a podcast.

133
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:37,510
Do you have guests on?
You have a lot of people.

134
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,750
You're friends with Comedians,
so you have funny,

135
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:44,740
insightful people all the time.
I can write here and then,

136
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,710
and then you have a,
you know,

137
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,720
then you're in the fight world and you
have,

138
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,643
you know,
people,

139
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,210
things,
people talking about things that

140
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,350
interest you.
Yes.

141
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,770
And if you go on a double date with
someone who doesn't check off any of

142
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:58,070
those things,
that can be real

143
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,530
fucking downer.
Some people just don't know how to tell

144
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,330
a fucking story either.
Yeah.

145
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,370
Oh my God.
We went on this one double date and this

146
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:08,900
dude started telling me this story about
his son and his son's basketball game.

147
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,170
And I swear to God there was fucking
nothing.

148
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,870
There was nothing there,
you know,

149
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,880
usually gets a few minutes and then the
coach apparently wanted him to do dance,

150
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:27,080
but he wanted to do that and trouble.
There's not getting enough time on the

151
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:32,081
court and it's droning on and on and on
and on and on.

152
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,290
And the guy's just like,
no,

153
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,960
no sense of someone listening.
There's no sense.

154
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,750
There's no interaction.
It's just like he's decided that he has

155
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:45,530
a story that he likes to tell and he's
going to go on with this story and he's

156
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:48,500
using his hands and he's bending his
head forward.

157
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,590
He's got all this crazy movement and
there's nothing there.

158
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,620
Just like the cause.
Probably cause that story works in his

159
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:55,910
dad's circle,
you know,

160
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,810
with his other dad friends that are,
that are dads on that team.

161
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,740
And then,
you know,

162
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:02,450
they have kids on that team and he tells
them,

163
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,700
can you believe when the coach and the
other dads are like,

164
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm,
I,

165
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,400
I saw the same thing.
I mean he usually scores so he thinks he

166
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,900
leaves that going.
That's a good story.

167
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,720
I think some people,
Joe,

168
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,350
that one,
they don't care.

169
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,400
They just wait for their time to talk.
Some people they talk and then you talk

170
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,990
and then they talk in the,
and everyone they know is boring and

171
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:25,430
they just can't wait to go to sleep.
And that's their life.

172
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,820
They fucking take sleeping pills.
Do you know how many people I've run

173
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:31,400
into that fucking takes sleeping pills
every night?

174
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,240
No.

175
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,320
Oh,
a lot.

176
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,840
Really.
It's one of the things that I do.

177
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,090
One of the things that I do,
I ask what you know,

178
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,150
I did this bit on Ari Shaffir show about
a house fire or a fire in a hotel that I

179
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,860
was in with Thompson girl.
That's right,

180
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:49,550
that's right.
And a Joey Diaz remember that fight

181
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,100
about it.
They tell us not to take the elevator.

182
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:54,350
We get stuck in the stay with a host
point of the story is I was ready to

183
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:58,580
fucking stampede these people cause they
were slowly walking down the stairs and

184
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,170
we got outside.
We were looking for Joey,

185
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:02,570
we were panicking.
Joey comes outside and they'd go,

186
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:03,291
where were you?
He goes,

187
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:08,291
I took the elevator like a doctor.
He was smoking a joint outsider and he's

188
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,570
smoking a joint.
He's the greatest.

189
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,880
But I realized while I was doing this
that some of these people were literally

190
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,890
waking up while they were walking.

191
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,880
And then I started thinking,
how many of these fucks are on sleeping

192
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:24,290
pills?
Because I knew Kevin James,

193
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,340
Kevin James would take sleeping pills
and he would do shit.

194
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,090
Like he made dinner once and he just
didn't want to admit that he made dinner

195
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,940
like you think.
I think he went to the store and bought

196
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:39,350
a Turkey or something crazy like that
and cooked it and went,

197
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,360
got up in the morning and didn't want to
admit he did it.

198
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,790
He was like,
no,

199
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,850
I didn't fucking do that because he
didn't remember it.

200
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:46,210
Didn't remember it at all cause it
warped him that much.

201
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,850
Remember Shit,
they just do things that don't never

202
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,220
taken one scary dude.
They scare the shit out of me when I'm

203
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,480
not tired.
I stay awake.

204
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm crazy.
That's crazy.

205
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,210
How fucking crazy.
Yeah.

206
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,260
If I'm not tired I just get up and do
shit.

207
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,470
I'm crazy.
Now do you sleep well when you like a

208
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:03,330
brick?
You know what I do if I'm tired or if I

209
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,620
want to get tired,
I jerk off.

210
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,330
Yeah.
I go out like a baby

211
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,630
almost instantly.
Especially high.

212
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,180
Oh,
sometimes get paranoid though.

213
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,280
Right in the middle of jerk.
I don't know

214
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,540
when is it going to hit.
What if tonight's the night that I never

215
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:23,541
wake up at those.
So I started getting into pain,

216
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,980
uh,
sleeping pills like I started asking and

217
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,810
people I work with,
uh,

218
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,580
at the UFC,
fucking tons of them.

219
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,140
Tons of them take sleeping pills every
night.

220
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,970
Tons of them.
And I'm like,

221
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,770
what the fuck man?
Every night.

222
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,910
Yeah,
I can't sleep without him.

223
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,100
Oh my God.
But that's not good.

224
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,740
You're not started.
It seems like the key to that.

225
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,620
Yes.
You don't get good sleep on though.

226
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:47,880
I don't think you get real sleep.

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,400
I heard a doctor talk about that one
time,

228
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,200
that you're not actually getting the
benefit of real sleep on that yet.

229
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,790
You're shutting something down,
but you're not actually dipping into

230
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,780
real rem sleep and,
and,

231
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:05,640
and getting all the benefits to your
brain that you're almost like getting

232
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:07,470
knocked out unconscious.
Right.

233
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,260
You're like,
when you get fucked up like Michael

234
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,093
Jackson.
Yeah.

235
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,050
I mean,
he went as deep as you get.

236
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,320
He was taking that fucking stuff that
they used to put people under

237
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,380
anesthesia.
He's getting hit anesthetized.

238
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:22,770
Yeah.
He imagined that every night a doctor's

239
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:24,350
administering that.
Oh,

240
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,700
through a mass.
K Are we removing your gallbladder?

241
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,690
No,
I just want to take a nap.

242
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,370
So just,
I just like this thing.

243
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,710
Oh,
well he was probably so fucked up.

244
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,980
You know,
I saw Dick Gregory talking about him and

245
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:37,500
it was really interesting because Dick
Gregory was getting interviewed by this

246
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:41,190
guy and I'm,
the guy was talking to him about Michael

247
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,940
Jackson and Dick Gregory just started
going off and he,

248
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:46,380
and he started screaming.

249
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,890
He never had a fucking child.
Do you understand me?

250
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,990
He never had a fucking childhood.
He never bounced a ball and he's just

251
00:10:54,991 --> 00:10:57,330
started going off of it.
Cause I guess he knew Michael Jackson

252
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,200
and was just saying he missed that part
of his childhood.

253
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:04,530
Like the whole Neverland thing and
hanging out with children.

254
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,860
A big part of that was just that he
never had a childhood.

255
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,020
I think that makes sense.
It does make sense.

256
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,510
I don't know if he ever did anything to
anybody.

257
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,250
I don't know cause I wasn't there
obviously.

258
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,570
But I think a lot of the people that
he's hanging around with,

259
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:23,220
those little kids,
their parents realize like this is a

260
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,400
fucking golden ticket.
Even if he never did anything,

261
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,580
they realize like,
this is a guy.

262
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:32,160
My kids spend the night over this
fucking crazy.

263
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Multi-Multi multimillionaire's house
hoes up fucking backyard filled with

264
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,830
amusement park rides,
toys in his house,

265
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,820
like monkeys and zebras and shit.
Yes.

266
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,300
If he's not a pedophile,
you know,

267
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,940
like there's something going on.
Fucking let's sue this guy.

268
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:48,774
Fuck it.
Yeah.

269
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,190
Who knows?
Yeah.

270
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:52,890
That he's a sad,
it's a sad story when you think about,

271
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,213
I mean

272
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,050
it's pretty well documented that that it
wasn't very pleasant to be a Joe Jackson

273
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,320
Kid.
No,

274
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:02,590
no.
That had to be a fucking disaster.

275
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,630
Yeah.
Then that'd be a goddamn nightmare.

276
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,850
Yeah.
And then you sound like a crazy guy.

277
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,880
That's how you get good.
Having a dad make you do that dance one

278
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,870
more time I guess.
But it's pretty,

279
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,750
is that the only way I wonder?
I don't think so.

280
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,810
Probably the only way to get that good.
I do.

281
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,660
I do think with,
uh,

282
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,350
with athletes,
you know,

283
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,640
I've read a lot of stories about how
dads affect certain athletes,

284
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,470
some of them,
but,

285
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:33,940
but there's the other side of it that
some of them just have that focus and

286
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:36,460
that desire themselves.
And some of them say,

287
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,020
the only way you get this good and it's
in you,

288
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,980
you gotta be the one that wakes up and
goes on the run and trains and that's

289
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:45,910
how you get it.

290
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,210
But there's the flip side of that is the
dad,

291
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,940
you know,
the overbearing dad that I'm going to

292
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:54,970
make you a champion or you have,
a lot of times it was overbearing.

293
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,550
Dad's kid winds up rebelling.
Sure.

294
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:00,910
They wind up just abandoning that dad
and they never want to have anything to

295
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:04,720
do with,
I'm sure todd Marinovich and Mark

296
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,810
Marinovich,
you know that's that whole story.

297
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

298
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,100
His Dad,
Marvin Marinovich was this like

299
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,140
legendary strength and conditioning
coach.

300
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:16,141
He's a guy I worked with Bj Penn when Bj
Penn was in his prime and he just has

301
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:21,160
these crazy really revolutionary ideas
when it comes to strength and

302
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:24,550
conditioning.
And he had his son on this insane

303
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:28,660
organic diet and I don't think he views
even feeding them meat when he was young

304
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,500
and it was at home.
So it was a,

305
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,200
this was 24 seven it was,
you're going to,

306
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,210
it's not like,
here's a meal plan.

307
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,730
Hope you stick to it.
I'm stretching him,

308
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,130
feeding baby.
So crazy.

309
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,450
We're gone.
US flexibility now.

310
00:13:43,451 --> 00:13:47,710
He did make todd pretty,
pretty fucking insanely good.

311
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,544
I mean,
todd was a,

312
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,480
was a hell of a quarterback.
Oh yeah.

313
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,430
But he also was freaking out and you
know,

314
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,550
went to drugs,
I think as a release for how,

315
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,800
how overbearing dad could be.
Yeah.

316
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:02,170
He blew a fuse.
There's a really interesting

317
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:03,910
documentary.
I think it's one of those espn,

318
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,460
it is 30 for 30 yeah.
I watched it and I was like,

319
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:07,460
wow.
Yeah.

320
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,860
What a,
what a weird life.

321
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:09,590
Having a dad.
Like,

322
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,590
then he became like a painter.
He's like an artist now.

323
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,390
Todd is now.
That's interesting.

324
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,540
He could have been,
it's worldclass NFL quarterback.

325
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,170
Yeah,
yeah.

326
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,570
Yeah.
But I think the only thing that really

327
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:21,760
derailed that was probably the drugs,
right?

328
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,690
Probably.
Yeah.

329
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,470
Well also desire.
Like he,

330
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:26,550
I guess he just didn't want to do that.
Yeah.

331
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,430
That's that desire thing.
Like you have to have it in you.

332
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:34,540
Like they say that some people do have
it in them and some people don't.

333
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,170
And so when you look at someone that
became successful,

334
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,130
it's so hard to figure out,
like what was it that drove that guy to

335
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,790
be so obsessed that he had to be the
best baseball player,

336
00:14:45,791 --> 00:14:48,010
the best basketball player?
Like was it,

337
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,920
was it his upbringing?
Did he have,

338
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:51,771
I mean,
with everybody,

339
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:51,980
there's a

340
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,150
different story.
Some people,

341
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:56,660
they had still had to prove something
like maybe they were born,

342
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,500
uh,
you know,

343
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,340
single mom didn't have a father always
angry and they want to prove to the

344
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:03,050
world.
There's those guys a lot.

345
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,040
There's a lot of proof to dads.
You know,

346
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,360
Jerry West,
his story that he's the guy that's the

347
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:09,920
logo of the NBA,
you know,

348
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:14,600
the outline of the player playing is
Jerry West and he had a really abusive

349
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:19,601
dad and he even said an interview.
He didn't think he would be as driven as

350
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:24,320
good in and be a great player if he
hadn't had basically a shitty dad.

351
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,430
Wow.
Yeah.

352
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,550
So there's,
there is a lot of that or the Herschel

353
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,570
Walker story.
Did you see his,

354
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,220
what was his story?
His story was,

355
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,050
it wasn't anything about that.
His parents,

356
00:15:33,051 --> 00:15:35,720
he had a good relationship with his was
getting bullied.

357
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,030
You know,
he was teased and bullied.

358
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:40,880
What the fuck could bully that guy?
I guess eight,

359
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:42,740
nine,
10 years old,

360
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,180
you know,
we're talking to that.

361
00:15:44,181 --> 00:15:45,890
Yes.
But he was getting pushed around.

362
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:50,891
He was Chubby and then it was Lord.
It was that focus though of I'm not

363
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,820
going to get pushed around anymore.
I'm not,

364
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,590
I'm not going to get bullied.
They,

365
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:59,591
he started running and doing those
insane claims at least of pushups and

366
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:01,700
sit ups and then he just,
you know,

367
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,300
also had genetics.
He was freak fucking ass.

368
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,940
He's still a freak.
He is still a freak come back then.

369
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,020
And the thing about Herschel Walker is
he allegedly never lifted weights.

370
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,520
Yeah,
that was a big thing.

371
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,410
Um,
I don't know if that's true,

372
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,760
man.
I don't know if it's true either.

373
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,560
Cause a lot of people said they saw,
like I saw him lift weights like people,

374
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,710
I was with him in the fucking weight
room.

375
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,290
Like when you talk to a strength and
conditioning coaches,

376
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,390
they're like,
there's muscles on that guy that you

377
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:32,480
really don't develop unless you're
picking up heavy shit.

378
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,700
Sure.
But I don't know if that's the truth.

379
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,990
I don't push up.
Claims are 5,000 a day for back then.

380
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,280
So that's a little also,
you know,

381
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,990
I'm a big Herschel Fan,
but that's a lot of fucking pushups.

382
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,420
I can do that.
I can do that shit that easy.

383
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,100
He was,
he,

384
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,940
he's like,
I was doing it between every commercial,

385
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,080
you know,
watching shows.

386
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,660
I'll just hit the ground,
bang out like 500 pushups.

387
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:54,494
Like,
come on man.

388
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,290
I think there's a lot in a row.
Uh,

389
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,090
a lot of these maybe,
you know,

390
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,660
like the fake ones and kind of push up
half ones yet.

391
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,460
Well,
he definitely did something right.

392
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,730
Whatever he did.
But he also says something that he said,

393
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:10,160
some stuff that's not physically
possible.

394
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,950
Like he said,
he only eats a salad in a bowl of soup a

395
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,590
day.
Well that's not enough calories to keep

396
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:18,230
your body mass.
That doesn't make your whole body.

397
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,550
The only reason why your body is the
size that it is as because you take in

398
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:25,160
calories I enough to fuel all that
muscle,

399
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,350
right?
If you don't take in enough calories to

400
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:29,990
fuel all that muscle,
your body starts eating that muscle.

401
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,210
And that's a fact.
That's just physiology.

402
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,520
So did you wonder,
by the way,

403
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,580
I was listening to your uh,
Lance Armstrong episode,

404
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,480
how when he was talking about how
writers are just not eat and you go

405
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:43,220
like,
how do you have any energy to ride?

406
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,380
Yeah.
We're not talking about a leisurely

407
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,210
stroll down the beach.
Yeah.

408
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,310
You guys are training for Tour de France
and starving

409
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,250
yourself.
How,

410
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,290
how do you have the probably
amphetamines if not amphetamines,

411
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,270
caffeine,
some,

412
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,170
some,
whatever.

413
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,280
Legal and it isn't there.
Just all kinds of cramping going on.

414
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,420
Your body's just,
I would think freaking out.

415
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,760
I would imagine me.
Fuck man,

416
00:18:05,761 --> 00:18:10,761
I have no idea how he said that's a very
common like bike cyclists that cyclers

417
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,703
colors,
right?

418
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,110
No,
it's cyclists.

419
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:15,400
It's not cyclers.
No

420
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,850
fucking mad at Jesus Christ.
He got mad at me,

421
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,110
man.
It was like,

422
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,360
it's cyclists.
Cyclists don't say cycling is so funny,

423
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,310
but I guess it's like if someone said
the ultimate fighting challenge.

424
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,920
No,
it's championship championship.

425
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:36,990
You ultimate 40 challenge challenge,
you know cyclist.

426
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,570
Got It.
Yeah.

427
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,520
I don't know man.
I think there's a lot of mental

428
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:43,530
toughness involved in that sport for
sure.

429
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,360
I mean those fucking people are savages.
They really are.

430
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:47,610
And they really are.
Yeah.

431
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,050
Just to,
I mean,

432
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,090
how many days in a row do they do it?
I think it's 21 something insane like

433
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,160
that.
2125 something like that.

434
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,540
Fuck man.
A hundred miles a day and 2,500 miles

435
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,750
total.
What I know or have you heard about

436
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,240
these super,
the super,

437
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,490
I don't know the right term.
Mega Marathon.

438
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,710
Yeah.
The 50 mile ones and then they do them

439
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,200
back to back.
There's a few people that do them day

440
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:19,860
after day after day as your body just
sustained,

441
00:19:19,861 --> 00:19:21,210
keep going.
In my neighborhood,

442
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:25,050
she ran to a ultra marathons in a row,
two days in a row,

443
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,930
100 miles one day,
and then a hundred miles the next day.

444
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,440
That's a chicken.
Hates her husband.

445
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,070
Sure.
You think fucking piece I shut.

446
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,200
She's fueled by anger.
You say my problems make your dicks off.

447
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm going to write this 200 fucking
miles.

448
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:46,740
Exactly.
She comes home and their toenails fall

449
00:19:46,741 --> 00:19:48,360
off.
Their toenails fall off when they do

450
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:50,250
that.
I saw a real sports about that

451
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,890
and then a guy who's so didn't care
about that just had them lasered off.

452
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,020
Whoa.
Because they kept falling off and he

453
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:58,854
goes,
I don't need them.

454
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,660
So he just had them watch.
What purpose do they serve?

455
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,860
The guests.
They protect the tips of your fingers.

456
00:20:05,861 --> 00:20:08,640
So that was going on on a man.
It is a weird thing.

457
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,740
When you look at fingernails,
they are strange.

458
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,760
They really are this weird,
hard surface on the,

459
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,700
like every other animal that has nails,
their claws right there,

460
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,340
the design to climb things or the design
to kill.

461
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,880
But we have these like weird tips for
good for opening up on envelopes.

462
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,210
Stickers.
Yeah.

463
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,720
That's where we have these scraping
stickers off.

464
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,170
Yeah.
It's a weird feature of our bodies.

465
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,420
It's weird how a person developed and
not only that,

466
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,230
like they just keep growing.
So you're supposed to cut them.

467
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,980
Like if you don't cut,
you ever

468
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,670
seen that guy in India that grew his
nails like the world's longest nails?

469
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,170
Yeah,
I've seen,

470
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,140
I don't know if I've seen him.
I've seen photos like that's so gross.

471
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,140
I think he did it for more than 18 years
or something like that.

472
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,920
Just grew as nails and they'd grew so
long that he couldn't use his hand.

473
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,130
That's one of them there.
They grow like that and what's facile?

474
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,630
Two hands like that I'm on.
So he has to wear like special shirts

475
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:13,630
with no sleeves.
That's ridiculous.

476
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Is I saw a dark guy.
I saw a tlc show where it was um,

477
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,480
I dunno.
Weird.

478
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,970
They have all these shows,
weird people.

479
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,010
And it was a lady who didn't cut her
toenails

480
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,910
and they,
they grow and curl,

481
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,730
you know,
she can't wear regular shoes and I don't

482
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:35,230
think she can work.
I think that was the other thing.

483
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,160
She's like,
I can't go to work.

484
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,180
I'm a fuck up.
These nails.

485
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,200
So
stupid.

486
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,530
I got priorities.
Yeah.

487
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,540
That lady was weird.
She,

488
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:44,980
she kept him straight.
Oh,

489
00:21:44,981 --> 00:21:46,020
Jesus.
No,

490
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,460
thank you.
Good Lord.

491
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,200
That's like a bear.
She looks like a bear.

492
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,630
Well,
how stranger people,

493
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,740
I don't know.
I'm sexy,

494
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,040
but you have to take care of those nails
like,

495
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,290
oh,
what's on the left?

496
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,450
No lower left.
Look at that.

497
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,670
What are those?
What are those?

498
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,750
Oh God.
Well that seems like we were looking at

499
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:12,070
some other stuff.
They're like,

500
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:17,040
we're looking at hand nails and toenails
there because there's the toenails and

501
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,790
then nails coming down.
It's coming down.

502
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,290
Yeah.
Christ.

503
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah,
some disgusting about long nails.

504
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,050
Yeah.
Y Yeah.

505
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,080
Even sometimes women will have the
slightly longer pedicure.

506
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,180
Why do you have long?
Well,

507
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,970
I don't even understand why.
Yeah.

508
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,140
Even slightly longer term growth trend.
Get that shit.

509
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:39,670
Even man,
you hate for that.

510
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,030
You have a half inch long on your toes
like,

511
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,480
Ooh,
so gross.

512
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,600
He fucking Weirdo.
Why are you doing that?

513
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,450
What are you using them for?
It isn't that strange though because of

514
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,260
a half inch on your fingers is totally
acceptable and can even be sexy.

515
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,600
Right?
Like girls would like red nails.

516
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,470
Sure.
Kind of sexy,

517
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,790
right?
Why is that?

518
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,260
I don't know the color.
I just,

519
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,300
because of the color,
but well,

520
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,340
how come the red toenails that are a
little long,

521
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,470
I'm not sexy maybe to somebody that it
is.

522
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,510
I'm saying I think it's fucking foul.

523
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,930
Somebody,
I'm sure someone's going to be,

524
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,630
I love those half luggage,
toenails,

525
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,760
Grossman who wants toenails that go over
the edge and inch people do it

526
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,170
purposely.
So they have to be,

527
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,190
have to be doing it.
Now.

528
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,840
Maybe it's one of those things like
girls think guys like it,

529
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,570
but only girls like it.
Like really skinny girls.

530
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,111
Yeah,
yeah,

531
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:29,651
yeah.
You know,

532
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:33,280
like girls will see a girl that's like
basically dying and he's like,

533
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,240
oh,
she's hot.

534
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,900
Yeah.
Look how skinny Shannon.

535
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,730
She's.
Yeah.

536
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:38,980
Miss,
how's that skinny?

537
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:39,850
No,
you don't.

538
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,910
There's some people that really think
that that looks good.

539
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:46,370
They really do because of a fashion
models,

540
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,090
you know?
Um,

541
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,500
I just don't,
I don't understand that.

542
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,060
Like,
no guy likes that.

543
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,730
I don't think so.
He was something,

544
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,890
it must be a few guys,
but they're fucked up.

545
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,080
Yeah.
But normal guys want meat.

546
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,750
Something to grab onto.
Yeah.

547
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,660
Yeah.
It's normal.

548
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,460
Like every guy I've ever asked,
would you rather your girl be 15 pounds

549
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:10,380
too heavy or 15 pounds to light?
Everybody says too heavy.

550
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,410
Everyone for sure to light is like,
like you gotta be okay.

551
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,760
Well yeah,
of course you're,

552
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,081
you're dying.
Yeah.

553
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,020
You're tired all the time.
You face is all sucked in.

554
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:25,820
Like you're making weight for a fight.
He to the right to take the ass moving.

555
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,610
Juggling jiggles are good.
Yes.

556
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,440
Bank.
That's what I'm talking about.

557
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:32,240
I'm saying.
So tell me about throat zillow.

558
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,950
So I started this podcast before we
started.

559
00:24:36,951 --> 00:24:37,840
He started telling me to start.

560
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,770
I go,
stop save it.

561
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,690
I you asked me if I have on snapchat.
Yes.

562
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,731
And I said,
no,

563
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,990
I don't post on snapchat.
And I said,

564
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:48,080
well,
I do have a snapchat account just to

565
00:24:48,081 --> 00:24:51,560
follow throat zillow.
And you said WHO's that?

566
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,140
And wait,
here's the whole story.

567
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:58,940
So my buddy josh potter is really,
he's a great comic out of Buffalo.

568
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,280
He turned me onto this.
Um,

569
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,800
so snapchat for people that don't know,
you know,

570
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:07,580
you post,
you can post photos but also like videos

571
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,150
15,
I think they're 15 seconds and they time

572
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,430
out and then once they air they're gone.
You know.

573
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:15,800
So if you follow someone and they post
all the time,

574
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:18,890
you,
you're seeing essentially a timeline of

575
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:23,750
their day or week.
So throw zillow came to prominence

576
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,890
because she is a,
uh,

577
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
an escort in the Dallas area and she's
hooked up with a number of high profile

578
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:35,420
people who she doesn't call out,
but one of them,

579
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,340
um,
Dallas Cowboy,

580
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:41,480
offensive Lineman,
Lael Collins hired her to blow him and

581
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:45,260
eat his ass and she did it,
but then he didn't pay her.

582
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,010
So she put him on blast,
called them out,

583
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,340
told media outlets and uh,
then I got turned onto her,

584
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,960
her snapchat because she'll also post
sometimes little snaps of her blowing

585
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:03,890
guys and eating their asses.
And I'm also running out of gas.

586
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:06,340
She does no,
don't put that way.

587
00:26:06,341 --> 00:26:07,790
I don't think she wants that went up.
Why?

588
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,860
Because that doesn't actually post her
face.

589
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,360
Oh yeah.
I don't know.

590
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,850
I mean that actually her,
I don't know if that's her.

591
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,420
I've never actually seen her face.
Um,

592
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,540
but anyways,
she,

593
00:26:20,541 --> 00:26:23,240
uh,
she really has a gift.

594
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,100
She's awesome.
She goes,

595
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,800
she had a monster energy Canada or mouth
man.

596
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,740
You should see her.
What with with Dixon?

597
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,770
Her mouth.
It's a,

598
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,860
she also goes by orally gifted.
Um,

599
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,750
two one four,
which I think is the dallas,

600
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:38,930
but yeah,
there it is.

601
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,540
Or the gifted underscore two and four.
She,

602
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,950
uh,
it says I swallow everything.

603
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,730
Lol.
And what does that line and they know,

604
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,840
oh,
what does that alarm or something,

605
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,690
I don't know.
That might be the end of a guy's cock

606
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:55,110
that she sucked off
the old stick.

607
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,230
Yeah.
But she posts hilarious stuff,

608
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,230
you know?
Yeah.

609
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,750
And she'll,
she'll do things like,

610
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,100
um,
don't,

611
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:04,650
nobody went to Dick suck right now.
Somebody is going to get something to

612
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,810
eat that and be like this.

613
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,740
She's like,
I just feel like giving me head right

614
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:15,000
and have it,
nobody's hitting me up.

615
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:20,190
I'm going to go get some gas.
And then she'll get some gas orally

616
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,190
gifted.
Well,

617
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:26,670
there was that other girl that got
famous in the hip hop world.

618
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,740
She called herself superhead.
That's right.

619
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:30,030
Yeah,
I remember that.

620
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,130
I know you're aware of,
well this,

621
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,530
yeah,
she was a tomboy.

622
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,930
She did a bunch of music videos too.
She was in,

623
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:38,910
she was a video vixen.
Oh,

624
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,080
and she was,
yeah,

625
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:42,570
she was blowing everyone left and right.
I think she wrote a book about it.

626
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,830
Yeah.
But I might own actually own it.

627
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,800
Well she's,
she puts everybody on blast.

628
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,770
Like Bobby Brown came over her house and
fell asleep on her couch and she,

629
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,170
she filmed it.
That's fucked up though,

630
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:56,004
right?
I think.

631
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:00,300
I think the fucked up thing like I,
so I had throat Zyl on my podcasts.

632
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:00,940
I did.
Yeah.

633
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,490
Yeah.
I messaged her and she called in,

634
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:03,570
so she,
she,

635
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,660
she called into the show and that's
hilarious.

636
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,540
And she was really candid and really
funny.

637
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,850
And she basically said,
you know,

638
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,020
I provide this service,
people pay and you know,

639
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:19,500
I'd never would call you out there.
That's part of the sort of unspoken

640
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,220
deal.
Right.

641
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,420
But when this guy didn't pay up,
it was fucked up.

642
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,160
You know,
we agreed to something and he goes,

643
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,480
oh,
I only have 100 bucks on me.

644
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,431
Rude.
Yeah.

645
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,470
So she goes at that point,
that's when I,

646
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,730
you know,
called him out.

647
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,830
Yeah.
Well he treated her like an idiot.

648
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,880
Yeah,
exactly.

649
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:40,350
Which was the wrong thing to do.
What a rude guy eat someone's ass.

650
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:43,410
And then we actually,
Josh and I had this car and I know you

651
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:45,630
don't call a football,
but maybe you'll be able to weigh in on

652
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:46,050
this.

653
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,080
We,
we started to discuss which position

654
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,640
players have the worst assholes because
if,

655
00:28:53,641 --> 00:28:57,480
uh,
she ate a pretty big guys ass.

656
00:28:57,481 --> 00:28:59,400
I mean,
how big is e six six,

657
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:00,870
three 30.
That's a big guy.

658
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,780
It's a big guy.
And she said it was a lot of work to get

659
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:04,480
in there,
you know.

660
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,250
So she said,
she said with skinny guys,

661
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,330
she can,
you know,

662
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,740
put them in the,
change my diaper,

663
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:12,870
like pull their,
pushing their legs up and get underneath

664
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:15,000
there.
But with these big guys,

665
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,180
the big guys,
they got to lay on their stomach.

666
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,890
And then you got to kind of open their
asshole out.

667
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:25,290
Does she require that they go through
some sort of a cleansing procedure?

668
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,480
I asked.
I'm glad you brought that up and she

669
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:31,200
said that no one's ever not been ready
for it.

670
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:32,910
In other words,
cleaned up,

671
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,610
trimmed up everyone.
Everyone's ready to go.

672
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,850
No one's,
no one has to be sent to,

673
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,830
but well,
she is known for her work.

674
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,540
So

675
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,340
yeah,
these guys fired their proper work

676
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,450
environment.
I think so.

677
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,363
Yeah.
You,

678
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,020
you will.
You wouldn't ask someone to do

679
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,210
electrical work in the pouring rain.
Exactly.

680
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,010
That makes sense.
A great analogy actually.

681
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,000
Yes.
So she's um,

682
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,440
she says,
you know,

683
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,250
it's,
it's one of her go to moves and gas.

684
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,660
Yeah.
I have a buddy of mine who hooked up

685
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:05,494
with this girl.
Yeah.

686
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,010
And uh,
they went back and forth online and then

687
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:12,310
they got together and he said
immediately before she even blew him,

688
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,760
she went right to his ass and I went,
what?

689
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,020
And he goes,
yeah.

690
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,880
He goes,
I just got off a plane.

691
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,530
Fucking disgusting.
Travel as is bad.

692
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,940
I'm like,
why?

693
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,460
He goes,
I was so disgusted.

694
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:32,461
I've never called her again.
She went right to his ass.

695
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,120
I'm like,
who does that?

696
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:39,010
A friend of mine said he also had an
online hookup where the lady was,

697
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,570
you know,
pretty,

698
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,300
you know,
aggressive with how she was setting it

699
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:44,560
up and he goes,
come on over.

700
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,720
And he said it was her first one.
He goes,

701
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,140
I wasn't prepared for that.
I had never went to the,

702
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,030
went to the like,
you know,

703
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,780
some ladies are bold.
Yes.

704
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,220
Yeah.
That's a weird move though,

705
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,054
right?
Yeah,

706
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,790
yeah,
yeah.

707
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,640
Go straight to the butthole.
Straight to the,

708
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:01,900
what do you,
what kind of message you're trying to

709
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,880
send?
It's trying to say like,

710
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,850
this is going to go crazy.
I'm going nuts.

711
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,550
You're saying I'm freaky.
Like if you were,

712
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,360
if you were wondering,
I am.

713
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,060
That's what you're saying.
As freaky as is possible.

714
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,400
That's just,
you bring a bunch of friends over to

715
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:17,380
lick his ass too.
That's yet

716
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,490
whistle.
And a bunch of girls start knocking on

717
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:24,960
the door like PAC man knoweth all have
fucking lobster bibs on.

718
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:28,090
Yeah.
That's pretty good.

719
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,160
You're saying I'm advanced.
Yeah.

720
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,760
Yeah.
I'm just does it,

721
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,620
you're not married me.

722
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,420
It's true.
Maybe that's why.

723
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,150
Maybe that's why she did it.
Maybe she just doesn't want a commitment

724
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:43,300
shaped the best way to keep a guy from
wanting to marry you.

725
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:47,440
It was just make them disgusted.
Eat His asshole right away.

726
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,150
Just really just tongue.
Fuck it.

727
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,370
You're not even like coaxing her into it
or anything.

728
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,680
She just leaves with that just pushed my
friend said he just,

729
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:01,900
uh,
he thought she was going to blow him and

730
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,890
she grabbed his dick,
picked it up and then pushed his legs

731
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:07,180
forward and he was like,
what?

732
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,100
She's just gobble,
gobble,

733
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:12,220
gobble,
like a rottweiler drinking out of a

734
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:16,180
toilet bowl.
Some chicks are just cool man.

735
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,970
Yeah man.
She's the best.

736
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,490
Well,
I mean how many guys are told their

737
00:32:24,491 --> 00:32:26,710
friends that kind of a story and they're
like,

738
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,030
wow,
that's awesome.

739
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,100
Awesome.
So what you guys doing next?

740
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,540
So you found a good girl,
Huh?

741
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,720
Being the family this weekend,
trying to get her pregnant,

742
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:36,010
bro.
Oh my God.

743
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,770
Oh,
you don't want to do that Wolf Wolf

744
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,390
Wharf.

745
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,690
[inaudible].
Yeah.

746
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:44,720
That's a weird Dang shit comes out of
there.

747
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,970
Like why?
Yeah.

748
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,430
Hmm.
Well why does it feel good though?

749
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,430
I know that's also part of the problem.
Why doesn't your asshole feel like your

750
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,510
fingernails?
Well,

751
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:57,930
hasn't it just like something that dead
dull spot that just pumps out shit.

752
00:32:57,931 --> 00:33:01,110
Yeah.
I remember doing that to someone in

753
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:03,600
college.
I only did it cause I saw it in a movie,

754
00:33:03,601 --> 00:33:06,750
you know?
You know what I did?

755
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,820
I got Hershey's Syrup and I thought it
was like Kinky to do it.

756
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,160
And then I realized as the Hershey
Spirit Spirit,

757
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,510
it just looks like she shit all over
because it's just liquid chocolate.

758
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,060
So I pulled my face up and I'm like,
Oh man,

759
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,840
it looks like she just shit in my mouth
even though it didn't taste like it.

760
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,640
Sure.
Looked like it.

761
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,350
Yeah.
That's not a good look.

762
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,600
No.
Yeah.

763
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,380
Look,
yeah,

764
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,080
it's like cherry sauce.
Put Cherry sauce all over.

765
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,070
Yeah.
That's not good.

766
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,620
I don't think she liked it either.
No.

767
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,090
Did she get weirded out by,
you know,

768
00:33:39,091 --> 00:33:40,410
she just like,
but you want to do right.

769
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,960
Alrighty.
Alright man.

770
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,580
Did she say it felt good?
Uh,

771
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,550
I don't remember actually.
I mean,

772
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:48,360
I don't,
I know,

773
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,590
I didn't think she was like,
hey,

774
00:33:49,591 --> 00:33:52,160
this sucks,
but whatever.

775
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,030
I don't remember

776
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,010
being,
you know,

777
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,180
big applause,
break or anything.

778
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,210
It's weird that some girls don't want to
have nothing to do with taking the ass

779
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:01,270
where other girls beg for it.
Yeah.

780
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,230
They love it.
Put something in there.

781
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,410
All Right,
God,

782
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,283
Huh?

783
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,420
Yeah,
but girls with toys,

784
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,870
that's always weird.
Hold on a second.

785
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,340
And girls come back with like a giant
black rubber Dick.

786
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:17,120
Like,
hey,

787
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,000
hey,
hey,

788
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,090
hey,
hey.

789
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:23,680
Now where's this going?
That's for you,

790
00:34:23,681 --> 00:34:26,860
right?
Or girl with a strap on.

791
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,630
Ooh,
I never had that.

792
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:31,260
No,
not interested.

793
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,220
Hmm.
Yeah.

794
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,540
If I want it done,
I'd fuck dudes.

795
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,370
Right.
Or have dudes fuck me.

796
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,490
Why?
Why would I want a girl to pretend to be

797
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:40,860
a dude?
Unless you love it.

798
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,020
Well,
some people like really trainees,

799
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:43,953
you know?
Yeah.

800
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,560
Insensitive.
I was insensitive with that word.

801
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,170
Yeah.
You still say cabbies though.

802
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,270
I don't have to take shabby call cabby
point counterpoint.

803
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:57,060
Well,
he sounds cute to me.

804
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,700
It does sound kind of,
I don't know why it's bad.

805
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,993
It's,
it's,

806
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,830
it's offensive.
What do you think,

807
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:05,790
I mean,
is it pretty obvious that the attraction

808
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:10,050
there for the people that are attracted
to it is that it's looks like something

809
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:10,711
and it's not,
I mean,

810
00:35:10,711 --> 00:35:13,320
is that the appeal you think?
Um,

811
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:16,020
I think people that like transgender
guys,

812
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:21,021
I mean there's probably a whole fucking
spectrum of different things that people

813
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:22,950
like them,
why they like it,

814
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,440
right.
But I think some of them,

815
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,440
they like the idea of it being like
naughty,

816
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,240
like someone with like she's got tits
and she's got a beautiful face and then

817
00:35:33,241 --> 00:35:34,074
you take her.

818
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,383
Right.
Right.

819
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,100
It's

820
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,100
just exciting that it's crazy.
Not t what also could be that you had

821
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:46,470
some weird experience during your
formative period,

822
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:48,130
like when you were young,
like,

823
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,270
like when you're developing,
apparently they say,

824
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,910
Chris Ryan has described this to me,
um,

825
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,900
that there's a state doctor,
Chris Ryan who wrote that book sex at

826
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:00,480
dawn.
I do podcasts with them all the time.

827
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:05,220
And he was talking about imprinting,
like as you're young,

828
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,440
like during your formative years,
I think it's,

829
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:11,610
I think he said between somewhere
between like 11 and 13 are nine and 13

830
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:15,060
or something like that,
that something can happen sexually.

831
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,220
Like someone could do something to use.
Actually,

832
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:18,870
maybe a man can do something nice
actually.

833
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:21,780
And you might not even be gay,
but you might get like sexually

834
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:23,520
imprinted,
you know,

835
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:27,870
that like that somehow or another
excites you and some sort of a weird way

836
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,610
even reluctantly excites you.

837
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,020
Yeah.
Even reluctantly.

838
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,460
Well,
for a lot of people there,

839
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:36,090
they're afraid of the shame that comes
with liking what you like.

840
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,200
Sure.
Like if you're a supposedly heterosexual

841
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,600
man,
but you're really into transgender

842
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:44,830
women,
there's,

843
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,190
you know,
you could run a risk of people finding

844
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:50,480
out at work and,
and thinking you're fucked up and um,

845
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,820
or you know,
labeling you so deviant and thinking

846
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,260
like,
what else is this fucker into?

847
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,500
You know,
it's weird.

848
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,370
I know,
I know.

849
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,670
Almost weirder than being gay because
if,

850
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,300
I mean there's some people that don't
like gay people.

851
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,000
There's some people are afraid of it or
there's a religious thing,

852
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,090
you know?
But I think that that's more accepted.

853
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:17,700
Maybe even then wanting to date a
transgender person.

854
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,833
Oh,
for sure.

855
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,860
I mean,
even in today's world,

856
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,670
the,
I think a lot of people have come along

857
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,960
way with,
you know,

858
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:28,990
at least somewhat accepting
homosexuality.

859
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,160
But when you get to transgender,
that's a big leap for a lot of people.

860
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,203
Yeah,
for sure.

861
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:34,991
For sure.
Right?

862
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:35,890
I think,
I think so.

863
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:37,060
I don't know.
Yeah.

864
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:40,600
They start looking at like you like this
is what your cards are.

865
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:43,420
You got to fucking deal with it.
You gotta take it.

866
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,190
Yeah.
And then some people like,

867
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:47,050
but my,
I got the wrong cards.

868
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,690
[inaudible] I got out there.
I feel like inside I got the wrong

869
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:50,524
cards.
Sure.

870
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,210
Not only do I support that,
I support people that feel like a dude,

871
00:37:55,211 --> 00:37:58,330
but want to be a girl.
Like I was definitely born a guy.

872
00:37:58,331 --> 00:37:59,410
I'm a guy,
but ah,

873
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,060
I don't want to be a girl.
Yeah.

874
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:02,590
Fuck it.
I want to get a sex change.

875
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,150
Okay.
I don't give a shit.

876
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,980
Yeah,
I'm gay.

877
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,880
I don't care if you tattoo your face,
go for it.

878
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,110
I had never care

879
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,350
what turns somebody on,
you know what I mean?

880
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:14,610
Like I don't understand how it would
bother you when when some people are

881
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:16,440
afraid,
you know you're seeing like the shame

882
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,870
and people finding out.
But it's amazing to me that it would

883
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:21,750
bother somebody.
What gets somebody else off?

884
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,840
You know?

885
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,930
I think its Americans,
Puritan culture where we're apparently

886
00:38:25,931 --> 00:38:28,390
when you compare us to the rest of the
world,

887
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,410
like as far as like what,
what we like and do you know what we'll

888
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:36,070
accept from society,
from people were like one of the most

889
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,210
puritan cultures on the planet.
So bizarre to think that that's our,

890
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,940
our surroundings.
Because you're,

891
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,190
when you're in it,
you don't even think about until you

892
00:38:45,191 --> 00:38:48,970
step out and you see how,
you know other cultures are.

893
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,250
Do you think we make the most porn if
you like the yeah,

894
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,460
I bet we make the most,
I think without question we make the

895
00:38:54,461 --> 00:38:56,110
most without question.
Without question.

896
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,810
Yeah.
Because industrywide I'm talking just as

897
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:00,070
a business,
there's,

898
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:05,100
there's no other place that's creating
the amount of content as the San

899
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,093
Fernando Valley.
It's gotta be,

900
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,420
well,
they're fucked now because they have to

901
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:08,490
wear condoms.
Stats.

902
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,380
That's why there'll be a change,
a shift,

903
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:14,530
but for the last 30 years,
it's gotta be California.

904
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:16,360
It's like when they started shipping
jobs overseas,

905
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,780
that's what it is.
God dammit fucking manufacturing jobs.

906
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,180
The fuck the middleclass.
It's harder than that to porn.

907
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,910
Shipping all these hard Dick's to her
place needs someone to put this

908
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,760
somewhere.
I put them wrapping them up with

909
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:28,870
rubbers.
That's the thing.

910
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,280
The idea.
That is a bummer,

911
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,990
by the way,
to me to watch that.

912
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,320
I've seen that and like,
I don't want to watch a guy wearing a

913
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,280
rubber.
No,

914
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,420
it's,
Oh,

915
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,310
isn't that funny?
Like why would you care?

916
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,580
But there's something about like,
they even try to trick you by having

917
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,080
those like super transparent rubbers.
Yes.

918
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,070
But there's something about the
glistening of the Dick just doesn't look

919
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:50,770
realistic.
You can't see the end like the rim that

920
00:39:50,771 --> 00:39:51,940
might've went down.
You know,

921
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,960
that's a fucking rubber robberies dicks
off though.

922
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,410
You know,
it bums me out the most when a girl's

923
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:03,880
blown a guy with a rubber on just stop.
Stop Buddy.

924
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,920
Just jerk off on the top of her head and
that'd be better.

925
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,360
I'll tell you don't even come near her
face.

926
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:14,260
Don't let her blow you the eye.
I just don't like it.

927
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,630
I don't want to watch it.
I don't want to see it.

928
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,490
I've seen one of those blooper videos
where they has the guy like,

929
00:40:22,491 --> 00:40:26,890
it's like a double team and one guy
finishes on a girl's head,

930
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:28,320
you know,
on her hair and she goes,

931
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,740
did you just come in my hair and the
whole scene to stops and there's like a

932
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:35,020
big fight.
Everyone's screaming and yelling.

933
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:35,921
Really?
Yeah,

934
00:40:35,921 --> 00:40:36,820
it's,
and he was like,

935
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:38,500
I'm sorry.
She got mad.

936
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,970
Oh really mad.
Really Mad.

937
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,860
Yeah.
Why don't you get mad at that?

938
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:46,120
Because he went right into her hair and
so she can't clean it.

939
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,360
I don't know.
I mean he's planning on going out like,

940
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,920
I think she had an appointment
afterwards.

941
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,140
Yeah.
Get their hair did and when they get

942
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:54,220
their hair,
did they like,

943
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:57,310
they like to keep it that way for days.
Do not fuck with the hair.

944
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,020
Yeah.
Don't come in it for sure.

945
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:01,250
Well,
especially if there's like hairspray and

946
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,520
then it becomes like stalagmites hangs
down,

947
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,040
gets caught up in the fucking webbing of
the hair.

948
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:09,790
No,
no,

949
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:10,570
wait.
Oh Man.

950
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,090
Not Bueno.
Even slightly.

951
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,630
No,
no.

952
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,820
It's the worst.
But eyelashes are okay.

953
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,350
Come on the eyelashes.
Yeah.

954
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:20,190
When they get it in the mug and then
it's dripping off their eyelashes like

955
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,560
Ooh,
they have that look on their face and

956
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:27,730
the flood or the IIF letter.
The eyelashes kind of in some ways

957
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:30,010
protect them from com.
Like a good,

958
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,130
that's why we have eyelashes.
Didn't Dr. Ryan talk about that?

959
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,510
A good thick shield like palm fronds?
Yeah.

960
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,550
Who Tags,
you know,

961
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:42,800
you know Joe,
we've studied,

962
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:45,230
um,
for the last few hundred thousand years.

963
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,080
Humans have eyelashes to protect them
from facials.

964
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,700
There's a weird thing,
huh?

965
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:51,030
Facials?
Like what?

966
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,850
Where'd that come from?
Like why,

967
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,500
why common someone's face?

968
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,390
Like what,
like come it used to,

969
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:58,220
it's kind of power.
It's a power move,

970
00:41:58,221 --> 00:42:00,140
right?
That I think it's a power move.

971
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,550
What's a freak move to right?
True girl sticks her tongue out.

972
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,550
She goes,
ah,

973
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,210
how about the scoop and score?
Isn't that crazy?

974
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:09,360
That's disgusting.
It's like,

975
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,280
oh,
there's little up here.

976
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,750
And they take it down and then they
pretend that it's the most delicious

977
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:19,700
thing ever.
That even on your watch and you're like,

978
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:22,630
I don't know,
it's been sitting on your face for a

979
00:42:22,631 --> 00:42:23,990
while.
You didn't remember it was there.

980
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:28,790
It's kind of cooled off and you're like,
it's delicious.

981
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,940
I like hot jar.
It's like,

982
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,210
you know,
you never eat a pot pie when it's cold.

983
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,880
Well don't you think those,
those save all the just videos

984
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,190
trusting man.
They see that's where a fellow draws the

985
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,630
line.
Like if you date a girl,

986
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:53,690
she used to be a porn star.
Well you know she just having sex.

987
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,690
Who cares if it's on camera?
But then if you watch a video of like

988
00:42:56,691 --> 00:43:01,691
five guys coming into a mug and she just
chugs it as,

989
00:43:01,941 --> 00:43:05,140
so there's a lot of those out there.
Jamie is going to throw up

990
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:15,170
and they like drinking through a straw.
So Gross,

991
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:19,020
Mad Max Hardcore Guy.
He opened up a woman's asshole.

992
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,210
Well,
the speculum,

993
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,710
then he pissed inside of it and then
attached to a straw to it and made her

994
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:29,030
drink is pissed.
That was opened up like a bowl.

995
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,460
What do you think his imprinting is from
childhood?

996
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,040
Whatever it is.
Not Crazy.

997
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,280
Not Good.
Someone did bad things.

998
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,230
I saw one of those,
uh,

999
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,510
was is a speculum,
is that what it's called when they open

1000
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:48,200
you up and the girl's ass and then they
put cereal and milk and somebody say to

1001
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:52,040
that of their fucking groceries shit
too.

1002
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,080
That's when they need to stop.
Like,

1003
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:56,750
I've had that.
I've had this bit,

1004
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,950
uh,
for a while.

1005
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,020
Then I just never figured out what to do
with onstage.

1006
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,530
But the bit was like,
why are they still making porn?

1007
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,050
Ou has jerked off to all the porn.
Like,

1008
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:09,770
how could anybody who's,
who's showing up at the video store on

1009
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:10,750
Monday morning going,
Shit,

1010
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,260
new shit here.
It wasn't new shit.

1011
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,210
Fucking constantly checking like no one
has seen all of them.

1012
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,740
Like we've,
there's enough,

1013
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,040
there's,
you could jerk off once an hour,

1014
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,760
every hour for the rest of your life and
you would never get through all the porn

1015
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:27,740
that's ever been made through 10
lifetimes.

1016
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,450
You could do that,
but yet they're still making it.

1017
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,770
Sure.
Like what is that?

1018
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,040
I Dunno.
There's

1019
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,040
just this insatiable appetite for it,
I guess from enough people because it's

1020
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:42,411
not like music or comedy or something
where people want new things because you

1021
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:43,761
like,
well,

1022
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,600
maybe it is.
Maybe that's it.

1023
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,500
I was going to say you like a particular
artist might say,

1024
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:51,030
uh,
you know Chris Rock.

1025
00:44:51,031 --> 00:44:54,660
Like when's Chris rock or Tom Segura
who's got a new netflix special that's

1026
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:56,610
available this Friday,
this Friday.

1027
00:44:57,450 --> 00:44:58,650
That's right.
Shameless plug.

1028
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,740
Um,
so like if you're a thompson guerra fan,

1029
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,500
like there's only one way to get it.
You've got to wait for Tom Segura to put

1030
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,390
out a new CD or a new,
a new,

1031
00:45:06,391 --> 00:45:08,730
a Netflix special.
But for a porn,

1032
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:11,880
I guess maybe that's what it is.
I mean guys like jacking off to one

1033
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:13,410
girl.
Right?

1034
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:16,710
So they're like,
they become like a Kendra lust fan.

1035
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:17,940
Sure.
You ever seen her?

1036
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,190
I that,
that name sounds familiar.

1037
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:25,080
So I'm sure I have all this good woman.
She's all woman.

1038
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,880
All she's milfy too.
She looks like she's like in her late

1039
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,700
thirties and it's ready to party.
I'm talking about it has some experience

1040
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,700
but keeps taking takes care of herself.
Sure,

1041
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,700
yeah.
Yeah.

1042
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,380
So like if you're a fan of hers,
there's only one way to get it.

1043
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:41,930
You got to watch her videos.
You know what mean?

1044
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,260
There she goes,
Pam.

1045
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,800
Oh yeah,
no,

1046
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:46,790
she,
that was sure

1047
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:53,100
somebody gets hurt.
So like if you're a fan of any,

1048
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:54,240
you know,
fill in the blank,

1049
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:55,171
Tara,
Patrick,

1050
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:56,370
whatever.
You got to wait for her,

1051
00:45:56,371 --> 00:45:58,020
which she's retired.
He had to wait for it.

1052
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,730
That's bomber.
When girls are still hot and they

1053
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:00,790
retire,
what are you doing?

1054
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,690
Well still jerking off over here.
Yeah,

1055
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,240
you're not done.
And I'm done.

1056
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,850
You know,
it's like back or not.

1057
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:08,791
Yeah.
It's like,

1058
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:11,250
uh,
you know if Connor Mcgregor retires now

1059
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,113
like come on,
come on.

1060
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,720
You got a few good years left in at
least cause you make a few videos.

1061
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:23,140
There's a thing about watching them,
you know where guys get obsessed with

1062
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:26,580
like one girl and then they'll go to
like the avn shows and then wait in line

1063
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,640
to get a picture signed and a,
that's too far.

1064
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,240
Almost they're going to charge how far
over truck I got a photo of a true and

1065
00:46:33,241 --> 00:46:35,400
they're like,
they're holding onto her and if the

1066
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:37,080
girls do escorting,
yes.

1067
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:39,510
The other thing,
some of those porn stars like you can

1068
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:41,400
actually fuck them.
Yeah.

1069
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,530
I'm sure it's a pretty penny though,
right?

1070
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:45,210
A couple of grand?
Probably think so.

1071
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,440
Yeah.
But is that awful?

1072
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,970
I mean,
is that worse?

1073
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,590
Here's the question.
Here's the big question.

1074
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,740
Is that worse?
Easy over there.

1075
00:46:52,741 --> 00:46:53,700
You're right.
Getting sick.

1076
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,160
None of news.
Um,

1077
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:01,850
is it worse to have sex with a guy who's
paying you than it is to have sex with a

1078
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,524
guy on film?

1079
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:08,130
Is there a line that's crossed that?
Mm hmm.

1080
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,860
What do you mean by worse though?
Well,

1081
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,880
I don't give a fuck either way,
but for some people is the perception

1082
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:19,881
more so like is it worse to be a girl it
was a porn star who also escorts or is

1083
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:22,500
it,
is it,

1084
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,280
you know what's absolutely,
I think the,

1085
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,860
it's between the two.
I would do it off camera.

1086
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,870
So you're,
it's not documented unless you,

1087
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,450
unless for some reason you want it to be
documented,

1088
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,060
you know,
if you're doing just your escorting,

1089
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,170
well it's just between you and whoever
you do it with.

1090
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:45,370
So you don't have that social stigma of
being known for doing that.

1091
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:45,941
Right.
But,

1092
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:47,800
but for those girls,
they don't care about that social

1093
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:48,850
stigma.
I got you.

1094
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:49,810
I mean,
that's their living.

1095
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,790
Sure.
But is it worse?

1096
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:58,230
Is it worse to be an escort and a porn
star or just a porn star?

1097
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,780
Or is it a stupid question?
Oh no,

1098
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:01,421
man.
I mean,

1099
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:04,960
it might be a stupid question.
I just feel like they're probably trying

1100
00:48:04,961 --> 00:48:07,120
to get lucrative.
That's exactly what it is.

1101
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:10,510
So just keep taking those escorts.
Hires.

1102
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,810
That's exactly it is.
Yeah.

1103
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,250
Well it's a good move for them for sure.
Probably get,

1104
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,390
I bet some of them get paid.
A lot of them I've had the rich dudes

1105
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,810
yeah.
Which cause they look,

1106
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:23,440
um,
and then if she was like,

1107
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:25,240
it's 10,000 and for the guy who was
like,

1108
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,620
okay,
yeah,

1109
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,940
then you,
you're getting paid man.

1110
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

1111
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,870
Well Red Ban had something and he put on
twitter the other day about a girls that

1112
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:37,900
uh,
take another vacation to go shopping and

1113
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:39,760
do by,
you know,

1114
00:48:39,761 --> 00:48:42,880
like,
and like he knows it was a thinly veiled

1115
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:44,830
prostitution reference.
Uh Huh.

1116
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,840
Cause that's what a lot of people do
apparently.

1117
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:47,831
Oh really?
They go,

1118
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:50,590
I'm going shopping.
Well there's so much money in Dubai.

1119
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:52,330
Yeah.
So much money.

1120
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:53,530
Like,
you can't even have your been,

1121
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,900
I've never been,
I was there once for the UFC because a,

1122
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:02,370
there was a ufc in Abu Dhabi and we went
to Dubai to do the Wayans,

1123
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,160
the Wayans and Dubai and then we drove
to a Abu Dhabi from there.

1124
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,930
Like fucking when you drive you have to
drive the fucking speed limit are,

1125
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:13,540
they will hit you with a missile,
they'll shoot you in the face with a

1126
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,600
missile.
Like it's so strict.

1127
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:19,870
They're like the drivers,
like they will not violate the speed

1128
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,820
limit.
Like if you violate the speed limit,

1129
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,540
if you do anything wrong,
anything that can allow you to get

1130
00:49:25,541 --> 00:49:27,290
locked up,
who knows what the fuck's going to

1131
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,650
happen to the office.
Literally,

1132
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,590
who knows what's going to happen.

1133
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:34,360
Especially if you are in a position like
a driver or a service person,

1134
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:39,010
like a waiter or waitress or a bartender
or something that you cannot fuck around

1135
00:49:39,011 --> 00:49:40,420
over there.
Like it is not,

1136
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:44,080
America is,
you're essentially dealing with kings.

1137
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,020
Like it's some kind of game of thrones
type shit and a lot of ways.

1138
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,723
But,
um,

1139
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:49,990
so we were there.
And,

1140
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,030
uh,
when you're in Dubai,

1141
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,840
every fucking car you see is,
you know,

1142
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,310
hundred thousand dollars,
$200,000.

1143
00:49:58,311 --> 00:50:03,130
So it's all Mercedes and Ferrari's and
Lamborghini's.

1144
00:50:03,131 --> 00:50:05,350
It's like everywhere.
I mean it's literally,

1145
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,330
it's like,
like a joke.

1146
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:11,290
It was like a scene in a movie of
extreme opulence,

1147
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:13,510
like over the top opulence.
When you go,

1148
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,070
come on,
it's not really like that,

1149
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,620
but it is really like that.
Like everywhere you go,

1150
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:20,110
everyone's got a million dollar car and
there's Bugatti va,

1151
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:22,960
Ron's,
they've got like one point $5 million.

1152
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:24,280
It's insane.
It's crazy.

1153
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,620
The amount of wealth.
I remember that the,

1154
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:27,470
uh,
Mike,

1155
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,220
one of my cousins

1156
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,220
came to do English course here at USC
and he has people from all different

1157
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:35,610
countries.
And so the,

1158
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:38,240
the Abu Dhabi guys,
uh,

1159
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,630
took the classes,
the kids from the class,

1160
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:42,261
you know,
we've taught kids,

1161
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:45,360
I'm saying 22 year old people,
um,

1162
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,670
out on la.
And they would just pull out stacks of

1163
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:50,450
money.
And he was,

1164
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,530
he was like,
where'd you get that?

1165
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,581
And he's like,
oh,

1166
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:56,570
we just,
the government gave us money because

1167
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:58,850
we're,
we're educating ourselves and coming

1168
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:02,090
back so they'll pay for everything.
And he said,

1169
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,320
you know,
you could go,

1170
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,570
if you're a born there,
you can go to the government and be

1171
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:07,040
like,
I need money for this.

1172
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,170
And they would just give you that.

1173
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:11,010
Yeah.
And he was just,

1174
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:14,280
they were just spending on everyone's
stacks of money.

1175
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,870
Well,
you're not supposed to drink there

1176
00:51:15,871 --> 00:51:18,450
either,
but you can't drink in the bars.

1177
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,310
There's certain bars where they allow it
because Americans western picture.

1178
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,760
But I got as a whole,
like they don't want drinking.

1179
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:28,230
Hmm.
It's very strange.

1180
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,320
And I had some friends when we were at
the UFC,

1181
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,420
uh,
I stayed in Abu Dhabi,

1182
00:51:33,421 --> 00:51:36,900
but a bunch of the guys were bored and
they were like,

1183
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:37,920
oh,
we're going to go to Dubai and see

1184
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:39,990
what's up.
They went to a bar and they said it was

1185
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:43,440
90% prostitutes.
It was all like eastern bloc

1186
00:51:43,441 --> 00:51:44,940
prostitutes.
Like you walked in,

1187
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:47,620
it was like a wolf den and just a bunch
of wolves

1188
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:53,490
looking at fucking snack on you.
[inaudible] like everywhere they went,

1189
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:56,310
like just,
these girls just go there and they just

1190
00:51:56,311 --> 00:51:57,900
wait for someone who's got a lot of
money.

1191
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:58,411
He goes,
you'll,

1192
00:51:58,411 --> 00:51:59,610
you'll,
you'll come with me.

1193
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:01,840
Let's go.
Yeah.

1194
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:04,140
And then they leave with a stack.
Yeah.

1195
00:52:04,141 --> 00:52:05,530
Fat Stacks.
Yeah.

1196
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,940
Well,
if you're a girl and you want to involve

1197
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:10,050
yourself,
it's a prostitution.

1198
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:11,640
It's probably a good move.
You go over there,

1199
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:16,350
just clean up for a month or a week,
come back with half a year's worth of

1200
00:52:16,351 --> 00:52:18,600
salary.
So people aren't doing that though.

1201
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,930
Yeah.
According to Red van allegedly.

1202
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,790
How's he so it on this?
He knows things.

1203
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:25,500
He knows.
He knows these people.

1204
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,230
He's aware.
He knows that Hoe and mentality.

1205
00:52:28,231 --> 00:52:30,600
He's around hose and definitely knows
hos.

1206
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,100
Yeah,
he knows him.

1207
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,490
We always teased because you know,
we started doing our podcast with him

1208
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:43,770
and he's our retarded stepchild.
He has special knowledge.

1209
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:45,150
Yeah.
He got,

1210
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:49,530
he knows things about certain things.
It's just like he's got to figure out

1211
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,830
like he started doing his own podcast
was guys only thing first.

1212
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,750
First episode just launched last week
and I've been telling them to do that

1213
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:58,350
forever.
I'm like,

1214
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,720
it'd be so good for you because you have
this,

1215
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,380
you have this weird style,
this weird way about you.

1216
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,720
I'm like,
get into it.

1217
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,673
Yeah.
You know,

1218
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,350
you'll find people that are wanting that
wanting to see it,

1219
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,350
but right now they only see it if you're
on someone else's show.

1220
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:14,281
Sure.
You know,

1221
00:53:14,281 --> 00:53:17,850
and like do your own show and it could
be all your freakiness.

1222
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,820
Yeah.
And then I think also when you do your

1223
00:53:20,821 --> 00:53:24,120
own show too,
you realize like how much is involved in

1224
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,970
like managing the sure.
Like

1225
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,320
making sure it steers in the right
direction.

1226
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:32,490
Thinking about what the subject you're
talking about.

1227
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:35,820
Is this entertaining is when do I pick
this up?

1228
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:37,470
Do I,
how do I ramp it up?

1229
00:53:37,471 --> 00:53:39,810
How do I,
how do I add some new stuff in there?

1230
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,190
And he has a lot of expense.
I mean,

1231
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:42,024
you know,
we actually,

1232
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:43,490
we love,
right Ben.

1233
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,760
Uh,
but he,

1234
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,400
he steered our ship for a while,
you know,

1235
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:50,310
kind of help shape things.
So I did a lot of people.

1236
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,570
Imagine if all the people that started
podcasts with him could tolerate him and

1237
00:53:54,571 --> 00:53:57,810
stay
Ari Dunkin.

1238
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:01,310
Joey is grime callen Sam.
Yeah.

1239
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,480
Sam Aaa.
Yeah,

1240
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:04,290
it,
Sam's still doing a show.

1241
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,090
I thought.
I Dunno,

1242
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,610
but I didn't think he'd stopped.
I don't,

1243
00:54:08,611 --> 00:54:11,450
I haven't seen it or heard it.
I Dunno.

1244
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,010
Well those guys definitely still do
their,

1245
00:54:13,011 --> 00:54:14,450
their punch drunk,
their sports ones.

1246
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,660
Yes.
That's still a thing.

1247
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,690
He still does that.
They do that on a another network.

1248
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:19,620
Right.
What does that all things?

1249
00:54:19,621 --> 00:54:20,341
Comedies.
I don't know.

1250
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:21,170
All things.
Comedy.

1251
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,890
That does sounds like in all things.
Comedy show.

1252
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:23,641
Yeah.
All things.

1253
00:54:23,641 --> 00:54:25,290
Comedy is a lot of good shows on it,
right?

1254
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:26,124
It does.
Yeah,

1255
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:27,150
it does.
I mean,

1256
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:32,151
that's magical and burr and then,
I mean we're,

1257
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:34,320
we're part of that.
Are you in your mom's house is,

1258
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:34,771
yeah.
Oh,

1259
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,490
I didn't know that.
Yeah.

1260
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:36,390
I mean it's,
you know,

1261
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,230
that being a part of all things,
comedy is almost like being part of a

1262
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:44,520
collective support thing where
everybody's still owns their own shows,

1263
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,530
but you just kind of have more power in
numbers thing,

1264
00:54:46,531 --> 00:54:47,730
you know?
How does that work?

1265
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,940
Well,
I mean I think the idea behind it was

1266
00:54:50,941 --> 00:54:54,960
that if,
if we are all together and we can

1267
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:57,240
approach people as here's what,
what,

1268
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,480
doing business with all things comedy
means,

1269
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:04,770
it means you're getting this bundle as
opposed to just saying one thing.

1270
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,610
You still get to be your own entity,
but you're a part of something when you

1271
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:09,480
need to be.
Right.

1272
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,261
And it helps for,
it's,

1273
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:12,660
it's great for promotion to,
you know,

1274
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:13,081
if,
if,

1275
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:15,270
uh,
like my special comes out,

1276
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:19,800
so I sent out a message to our group and
then everybody who has a podcast,

1277
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:24,830
we'll get
info about helping to plug my thing for

1278
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,490
each other.
So that's cool.

1279
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,383
I mean,
you're getting,

1280
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:30,360
if you get every show together,
you're getting a few million downloads.

1281
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,090
Well we kind of all do that for each
other we knew anyways.

1282
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:33,840
Yeah,
absolutely.

1283
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:37,740
I'm always tweeting for friends and
you'd do the same and we all do that for

1284
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:39,570
each other.
We support each other.

1285
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,280
That's the best kind of network,
right?

1286
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:43,110
That kind of net worth is totally
organic.

1287
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,860
Yes.
There's no financial gain in it at all.

1288
00:55:45,861 --> 00:55:47,100
We all just kind of help each other.

1289
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,150
Yeah,
absolutely.

1290
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:49,051
Yeah.
I mean we,

1291
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:50,070
I mean,
I know we've,

1292
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,520
as all things comedy,
we've also worked with sponsors that,

1293
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,240
you know,
the idea was that we're approaching you

1294
00:55:57,241 --> 00:56:00,150
because we have this collective and they
responded to it.

1295
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,053
So,
okay.

1296
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,930
So like a,
they handled the ads and they bring them

1297
00:56:03,931 --> 00:56:04,800
to you.
Is that how it works?

1298
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,850
Yeah,
like so with like,

1299
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,520
you know,
our bill approach,

1300
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,690
um,
you know,

1301
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:13,590
whatever company and say we have 50
shows,

1302
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,160
here's our gross amount of downloads.
If you sign up to do this set amount and

1303
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:22,740
then kind of divvied up amongst the
people that can do it.

1304
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:24,130
So we've that a few times.
That's

1305
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,700
interesting.
So is the amount of money that you get

1306
00:56:27,701 --> 00:56:29,710
based on the amount of downloads that
you have?

1307
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,850
Yes,
exactly.

1308
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,220
Hmm.
Who manages all that?

1309
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:34,900
It seems like it's,
it's a,

1310
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:36,160
it's a lot of work,
man.

1311
00:56:36,161 --> 00:56:38,440
I mean,
Mike is one of the guys over there.

1312
00:56:38,441 --> 00:56:40,420
I think Flynn,
and I'm trying to remember another name,

1313
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,261
but it's,
it's a,

1314
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:43,930
it's a job that's a full time job.
At a certain point in time though,

1315
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:46,030
is you're podcast becomes more and more
successful.

1316
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,560
It seems like that would kind of get in
the way.

1317
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,750
Well,
it doesn't really,

1318
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:51,850
like I said,
because those guys are so about Al and

1319
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:52,930
bill,
Hey,

1320
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:56,470
we're not taking anything from you and
do whatever you do,

1321
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:57,850
whatever you want.
Right.

1322
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,130
That they're not,
they're not saying if you do this,

1323
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:02,650
you can't do that there.
It's almost like they're saying,

1324
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,760
do whatever you do and in addition you
can do this with us.

1325
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,450
You know?
That's a perfect world though.

1326
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,490
It is a perfect world.
Yeah.

1327
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:12,010
That's beautiful.
Your podcasts is fucking blown up,

1328
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:12,910
man.
It's amazing.

1329
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,010
It's been going well.
Yeah,

1330
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,390
it's amazing.
And you guys do live ones too.

1331
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,770
The live ones.
I see.

1332
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:20,440
When you guys tweet about live once and
the people go to them.

1333
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:24,070
It's a thing like there's a,
there's a whole thing going on with the

1334
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:24,970
mommies.
Yeah.

1335
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,150
People keep,
people get excited and they go live

1336
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:30,160
podcasts or something fucking different
man.

1337
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,380
It's fun man.
We did a at the ice house in the,

1338
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:37,381
in the main room and it sold out like a
couple of months ago because we've been,

1339
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,130
you know,
when you're doing it again,

1340
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,630
I don't have,
uh,

1341
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,880
we don't have it set up,
but we need to do it.

1342
00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:44,160
Let me gum.
I want to be a gas.

1343
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:45,170
Do you want to be a guest on live?

1344
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:46,570
Okay.
All right.

1345
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,200
We're got to start doing live podcast.
I've done a few other people's podcasts

1346
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:52,810
live,
but it's really fun to do live.

1347
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,240
I did fit simmons the other day.
We had a great time.

1348
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:59,620
He's doing it in the belly room.
His 500th episode with his Buddy Mike.

1349
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,540
It was awesome.
It's really fun.

1350
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:02,350
Yeah.
We uh,

1351
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:06,790
we just did his show to Fitzsimmons.
You find yourself like going for jokes,

1352
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:09,190
more like going,
it changes.

1353
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,580
But here's the thing there.
So geeked up for those laughs.

1354
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:13,450
Yes.
So it's a,

1355
00:58:13,451 --> 00:58:15,250
it becomes a really fun environment to
do it.

1356
00:58:15,251 --> 00:58:19,510
Then I watched another podcast live
that's not mine and not yours and not

1357
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:21,160
fit semans into,
oh my God,

1358
00:58:21,161 --> 00:58:24,040
I wanted to run through a fucking wall.
I was like this.

1359
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,530
Some podcasts are weird,
man.

1360
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,830
It's,
they find their own level,

1361
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,080
like water seeks its own level.

1362
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:35,490
They find their own vibe and there's
some podcasts where you,

1363
00:58:35,491 --> 00:58:38,680
you go and you'll,
there's fans of that podcast.

1364
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:42,170
You'd go and see it and you're like,
this is not my fucking scene

1365
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,840
at all.
They weren't swearing.

1366
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:48,850
They were doing it very much like a
radio show.

1367
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,950
There's gotta be a bit,
a little bit of that too,

1368
00:58:50,951 --> 00:58:54,040
don't you think to probably stand up
shows.

1369
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,720
Oh yeah.
You Fuck,

1370
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:57,760
you don't end up walking into,
but if you were to go to,

1371
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,290
oh,
so and so's here tonight and it's sold

1372
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:00,310
out and you walk in,
you're like,

1373
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:02,100
what the fuck is this?
Oh yeah,

1374
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,910
yeah.
Well that's just the way of the world,

1375
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:05,410
right?
That's how it is with music,

1376
00:59:05,411 --> 00:59:07,030
with everything.
Movies.

1377
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:08,030
I mean,
I,

1378
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:11,770
I've you seen pitch perfect.
That's the singing one.

1379
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,330
Exactly.
No,

1380
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:14,200
you haven't.
No,

1381
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,680
no.
But fucking millions of chicks have as a

1382
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:21,470
blanket pitch.
They fucking love it.

1383
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,400
They get crazy.

1384
00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:24,020
It's not bad.
It's not bad.

1385
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:25,180
It's not them.
It's the,

1386
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,920
what's the like what they like,
there's a lot of shit I like the people

1387
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:28,970
don't like,
yeah.

1388
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,000
Somebody told me one time and it was
about,

1389
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,050
you know,
a movie come out.

1390
00:59:33,051 --> 00:59:33,980
It's one of those,
uh,

1391
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,290
comedy comes out and you go,
well,

1392
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:38,570
this looks like fucking shit.
Right?

1393
00:59:38,571 --> 00:59:42,610
And there's billboards and there's
always a few famous people in it.

1394
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,360
And you got,
and I was hating on how shitty it

1395
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:47,780
looked.
Terrible.

1396
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:48,980
And he goes,
well,

1397
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:51,200
you know,
this wasn't made for you.

1398
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:52,700
And I go,
yeah,

1399
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:53,331
no,
I know.

1400
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:53,751
He goes,
no,

1401
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:55,190
no.
But like there's a,

1402
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:58,090
there's a lot of people that love this.
Oh yeah,

1403
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,080
this just isn't for,
you know,

1404
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:02,120
it's not made for you.
And I started to think of entertainment

1405
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,990
differently from the moment that was
said to me that I see things now,

1406
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:08,120
trailers,
posters,

1407
01:00:08,121 --> 01:00:09,830
commercials for something.
And I go,

1408
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,600
oh,
but this has made for a different

1409
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:12,620
audience.
You know,

1410
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:15,140
there's things that are made for me
where I respond to and I go,

1411
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,040
oh,
I fucking can't.

1412
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,030
Well,
that's for me.

1413
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,680
That's why it's so important to do what
you like on stage.

1414
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:23,060
Oh,
stand up wise.

1415
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,870
If you start trying to make it for
somebody.

1416
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,010
Yeah.

1417
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,720
Those guys are,
they're fucked.

1418
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,360
Those guys who create those squeaky
clean acts,

1419
01:00:30,361 --> 01:00:33,630
but they're not squeaky clean.
Those are tortured people of course,

1420
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:36,750
because they're literally making art
that's not for them.

1421
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:38,340
Right.
But you're,

1422
01:00:38,341 --> 01:00:39,390
you,
you're,

1423
01:00:39,391 --> 01:00:42,300
you and you can't be,
you like the audience won't accept it.

1424
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,170
She kept talking about roofing chicks
and sticking around and when they're

1425
01:00:46,171 --> 01:00:47,004
asleep.
Yeah.

1426
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:49,380
I watched,
uh,

1427
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,750
speaking to bill cosby,
I watched his lawyer,

1428
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:55,200
uh,
debate some commentator or some

1429
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,290
television pundit or whatever you would
call them hosts.

1430
01:00:58,800 --> 01:00:59,340
And,
uh,

1431
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,860
she was explaining,
you know,

1432
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:02,880
what,
that,

1433
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:07,650
how ridiculous these allegations are and
how Mr Cosby,

1434
01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:10,500
you know,
didn't do any of these things and that

1435
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,000
all these women,
like their stories,

1436
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,310
some of them are just,
they were like,

1437
01:01:14,311 --> 01:01:18,420
he grabbed them by the wrist hard.
Like some of them aren't even sexual

1438
01:01:18,421 --> 01:01:23,421
allegations and she's like effectively
sort of muddying the water and that he

1439
01:01:23,581 --> 01:01:26,970
is a very rich,
wealthy man.

1440
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:29,630
And then that has to be taken into
consideration that these people are

1441
01:01:29,631 --> 01:01:31,440
doing this for attention.
And I was like,

1442
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:32,400
wow,
this is,

1443
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:36,690
it's fascinating to watch the spin,
the dance,

1444
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:37,681
you know?
And the guy was saying,

1445
01:01:37,681 --> 01:01:39,390
well,
there's 50 people though.

1446
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:40,141
Right?
And she was like,

1447
01:01:40,141 --> 01:01:41,160
well,
out of those 50,

1448
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,340
a lot of them are not even sexual
allegations and not even sexual assault

1449
01:01:44,341 --> 01:01:45,400
allegations,
which I didn't know,

1450
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,590
you know,
only 23 or six 37.

1451
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,390
Yeah,
I don't,

1452
01:01:51,391 --> 01:01:53,100
uh,
I don't know if he did or not,

1453
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:58,101
but I haven't heard of another person
ever that's had 50 people claimed that

1454
01:01:59,041 --> 01:02:02,130
he raped them by giving them drugs.
I know it's the,

1455
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:07,020
it's the,
I think the sad part is the people who

1456
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:11,130
really want to defend the,
like the conspiracy theories on it.

1457
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:11,781
Oh yeah.
He was,

1458
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:13,590
you know,
he was about to buy NBC.

1459
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,770
I don't know if you know that he was
making a move to by NBC and they don't

1460
01:02:16,771 --> 01:02:19,080
want a black man in power like that.
It's so ridiculous.

1461
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:19,951
Yeah.
Oh,

1462
01:02:19,951 --> 01:02:20,040
they

1463
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,940
don't.
Okay.

1464
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,290
Nobody wants to take down cosby.
Nobody's agenda.

1465
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:28,050
Was that why they would have taken down
Oprah first?

1466
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,010
For sure.
Man.

1467
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,650
It's so silly.
It's worth more than anyone ever.

1468
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,580
It's so silly.
She's the most successful entertainer

1469
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:38,160
ever.
And she doesn't even have a talent.

1470
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:39,870
Not a singer,
not dancer.

1471
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,170
It's not great actress.
What?

1472
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:42,840
What'd she do?
She doesn't tell jokes.

1473
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,600
What she does.
She talks to people giving away cars,

1474
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,120
will get up in the morning and look at
the sun and think,

1475
01:02:48,190 --> 01:02:48,900
eh.
It's like,

1476
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:49,530
yeah.
Okay.

1477
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:51,960
Well she has like positive messages.
Super Positive.

1478
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:55,980
She is really good for menopausal women.
Like they really relate to her.

1479
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:57,000
Oh,
a strange way.

1480
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:57,931
Yeah.
So,

1481
01:02:57,931 --> 01:02:58,800
you know,
we're vibe down,

1482
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:03,801
but I get why people do have their,
why they want to defend them.

1483
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:06,980
I understand the,
the motivation and the,

1484
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,370
and,
and feeling like,

1485
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:09,090
oh yeah.

1486
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,070
The adoration for him and wanting to
defend.

1487
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,160
I totally get why they do it.
And the reality is we don't know.

1488
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,010
Yeah,
that's true.

1489
01:03:15,010 --> 01:03:16,410
Really don't know.
But I mean,

1490
01:03:16,411 --> 01:03:18,600
the idea that you could never find 50
liars,

1491
01:03:18,601 --> 01:03:21,960
of course you could.
Of course you could.

1492
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,610
But it's,
you know,

1493
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:24,510
I think the,
the,

1494
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:29,930
the argument that I find the most sort
of ignorant and uninformed is the one

1495
01:03:30,151 --> 01:03:31,590
where people go,
why did they wait that long?

1496
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:32,910
Well,
you know,

1497
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:37,080
if you,
if you talk to any sex crimes unit,

1498
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,480
uh,
officer detective,

1499
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:43,530
any psychologist about victims of sexual
assault,

1500
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:47,640
it's not unusual for it to go and report
it or for it to go a long time without

1501
01:03:47,641 --> 01:03:51,630
someone wanting to talk about it.
It's completely within the spectrum of

1502
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:54,930
normal responses to something like that.
So when people are like,

1503
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,370
well,
you know what happened 25 years ago?

1504
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,210
Yeah,
it's normal.

1505
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,460
It's normal for someone not to bring it
up completely normal.

1506
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:01,020
Well,
there's a lot of shame involved.

1507
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:02,010
Of course.
Some women,

1508
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:04,410
they would rather just forget about it
then report it.

1509
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,140
Yeah.
They would rather just pretend it never

1510
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:09,990
happened.
Then go through all the public shaming

1511
01:04:09,991 --> 01:04:12,210
and then you're dealing with an insanely
rich,

1512
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:15,180
insanely powerful man who was loved by
so many.

1513
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,640
And then if there was no previous
allegations,

1514
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:19,650
who the fuck is going to believe you?
Yeah.

1515
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,510
Like to a woman in 1996 let's say back
when he was,

1516
01:04:24,511 --> 01:04:26,490
you know,
not doing the show anymore,

1517
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:28,020
but he's in his heyday.
Right.

1518
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:31,800
It's loved by everybody and he's
drugging checks and I'm like,

1519
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,180
she's probably like to,
how does this,

1520
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:34,240
this can't be.
Yeah,

1521
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,360
I'll just fuck it.
I'll just eat it.

1522
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:38,190
I'll just deal with it.
Is deal with it.

1523
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,690
But then they,
it fucks with them,

1524
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:40,680
I'm sure for a long time.

1525
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,850
Oh,
for sure.

1526
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,140
Yeah.
Could you imagine?

1527
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:44,640
Well,
that was the weirdest thing is that some

1528
01:04:44,641 --> 01:04:47,520
of them claimed they were,
that he was like in a mentorship role

1529
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:49,950
with them.
I got help you with your career.

1530
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:53,280
I'll do this and have a coffee.
That was his moves is power move.

1531
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:56,310
Yeah.
That's sounds to me more.

1532
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:57,180
Is there more?
You want more

1533
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,350
good.
What is this?

1534
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,280
Butter coffee.
And that's a caveman coffee with a

1535
01:05:04,281 --> 01:05:06,570
little grass fed butter and some mct
oil.

1536
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,820
It's good for the soul.
That's lovely.

1537
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:11,070
Just feel right.
Lovely.

1538
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,720
I felt good.
So,

1539
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:14,280
um,
you're a trump supporter,

1540
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:15,630
right?
Big Time Man.

1541
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:18,010
Southern

1542
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
California chapter head.
These Bernie Sanders people been fucking

1543
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:23,771
tweet,
not me.

1544
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:26,770
There's so mad because I said that
Bernie Sanders supported,

1545
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:30,220
uh,
90% taxing of the rich apparently is not

1546
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:31,830
exactly true.
Uh,

1547
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:35,020
this is what assault course,
correct it for the Bernie Sanders people

1548
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:38,380
cause they get upset.
What he did say was they're talking

1549
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:41,230
about marginal tax rate,
which that means if you make over a

1550
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:43,990
certain amount,
how much should you tax?

1551
01:05:44,410 --> 01:05:49,150
And we're gonna cap that are now,
he was saying that for a marginal tax

1552
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:50,370
rate,
uh,

1553
01:05:50,371 --> 01:05:52,090
would you,
is 90% too high?

1554
01:05:52,091 --> 01:05:56,320
He said No.
And that's for extremely wealthy people.

1555
01:05:56,321 --> 01:05:59,170
So like say if you make,
let's say if you make 10 million bucks a

1556
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:01,450
year,
everything over 10 million bucks,

1557
01:06:01,451 --> 01:06:06,120
they would tax at 90% and I'm just
coming up with a number for 10 but the,

1558
01:06:06,121 --> 01:06:09,400
the regular,
and he thinks it's not too much to tax

1559
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:11,920
90% over amount.

1560
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,650
But the problem with this kind of
thinking is,

1561
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:15,700
well people say,
Ooh,

1562
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,560
it's going to help other people.
It's going to be a good for other

1563
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:20,050
people.
Not necessarily.

1564
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,170
The problem with that kind of thinking
is that money goes to the government and

1565
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:25,360
the government is a bunch of fucking
monkeys.

1566
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:26,680
Yeah.
That's the reality.

1567
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,070
It's not,
it's not like an insanely ethical,

1568
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:32,770
really educated,
super smart,

1569
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:35,560
really disciplined,
conservative,

1570
01:06:35,561 --> 01:06:39,090
fiscally conservative person who's gonna
take care of this money and allocated

1571
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,360
correctly.
No,

1572
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:42,220
you're going to give it to the
government and you get to create bigger

1573
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:44,470
government and got to create
bureaucracy,

1574
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,000
red tape,
more people,

1575
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:48,940
more bullshit,
more jobs that are bullshit jobs.

1576
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,130
It's not necessarily going to help
people.

1577
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,720
And then he,
he,

1578
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:55,660
I think Bernie Sanders says a lot of
good shit.

1579
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:59,470
Like people that think that I'm a,
I'm Bernie Sanders Hater.

1580
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,000
He says a lot of good shit.

1581
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:06,210
I like what he says about marijuana,
but he says some fucking silly shit too.

1582
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,860
Here's one of the things that he said
that drove me crazy.

1583
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:14,250
You don't necessarily need a choice of
23 underarm spray deodorants or 18

1584
01:07:14,891 --> 01:07:18,520
different pairs of sneakers when
children are hungry in this country.

1585
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:21,730
Those two things are totally unrelated.
What's his,

1586
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:25,990
that's totally unrelated.
Like what if you wanted to open up a

1587
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:29,650
fucking deodorant company,
you shouldn't be able to open up a

1588
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:31,480
deodorant company because children are
starving,

1589
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:36,660
so you should work to to feed children
what's instead of renting in which he

1590
01:07:36,731 --> 01:07:38,830
said that though.
I mean we was just talking about the

1591
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:41,560
economy.
It's just talking about the world and

1592
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:46,090
the idea of a choking on choice.
You know,

1593
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,640
if too much,
too many toys that we have too many

1594
01:07:48,641 --> 01:07:51,190
choices that we divert our,
but here's the thing,

1595
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:55,180
when you think about these choices,
you're talking about these choices that

1596
01:07:55,181 --> 01:08:00,181
are created by whatever percentage,
whatever number of 300 million people,

1597
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:05,380
that has nothing to do with whether or
not poor people get fed.

1598
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,050
It just doesn't.
Right.

1599
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,530
And the what in taking money away from
wealthy people,

1600
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:14,350
it doesn't have anything to do with
whether or not poor people get fed.

1601
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,680
I think that one of the things that he
said that I agree with wholeheartedly is

1602
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:22,460
they need to stop people,
these corporations from hiding their

1603
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:24,470
money overseas where they don't have to
pay taxes on it.

1604
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,840
Yeah,
a hundred percent hundred percent I

1605
01:08:26,841 --> 01:08:30,290
think that's fucking criminal.
If you want all the benefits of living

1606
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:32,720
in America,
you want all the benefits that are

1607
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,750
provided to you by this free country,
but you want to store your money

1608
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:37,760
overseas,
fuck you,

1609
01:08:37,761 --> 01:08:40,130
and you don't want to pay taxes on that.
Fuck you.

1610
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:45,340
But maybe there's some compromise where
that tax rate does get adjusted for that

1611
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,740
a little bit so that they have the
incentive.

1612
01:08:48,741 --> 01:08:50,330
Right.
Cause the right cat over here.

1613
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:51,890
Yeah.
Because right now the reason they're

1614
01:08:51,891 --> 01:08:56,210
saying well I'm going to keep it over
there cause I'm saving so much fucking

1615
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:58,190
money but they make so much money.

1616
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:58,981
Yeah,
I agree.

1617
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:02,150
I'm just saying those are greedy Kershaw
for sure they are.

1618
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,090
Because you're talking about people that
are making insane amounts of money that

1619
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:07,930
are doing that.
People that are barely bought theirs.

1620
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:10,860
So I think in that sense,
yeah they,

1621
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:13,250
that's,
I'm a hundred percent with him on that

1622
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:17,120
and corporate tax shelters,
there's a lot of like really sneaky shit

1623
01:09:17,121 --> 01:09:19,460
where you find out companies made
billions of dollars and they paid almost

1624
01:09:19,461 --> 01:09:21,350
nothing in taxes cause it's shelters.
Shame.

1625
01:09:21,351 --> 01:09:24,350
I'm 100% with him on that.
I think he's got a lot of really good

1626
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,400
points.
He's got a really,

1627
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:29,030
I mean he's 100% down with pot.
I appreciate that.

1628
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:33,410
His position on cannabis is,
it's totally on unnecessary and criminal

1629
01:09:33,411 --> 01:09:36,410
to have it illegal.
I believe 100% on that and I also

1630
01:09:36,411 --> 01:09:39,590
support them 100% on the idea of a
living wage.

1631
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:42,680
Like if somebody works 40 hours a week,
they should be able to feed themselves

1632
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:43,700
and have a roof over their head.

1633
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:46,070
Yeah,
I'm 100% down with that.

1634
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:49,340
I think a minimum wage for a kid who's
in high school or something like that,

1635
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:51,950
it's still lives their parents.
That's one thing and I think there are

1636
01:09:51,951 --> 01:09:56,210
entry level jobs like that where someone
should make whatever it is,

1637
01:09:56,510 --> 01:09:59,090
but it should be enough where you could
live.

1638
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:01,910
You know if you are,
if you're a person who's 18 years or

1639
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:05,750
older and you're working at a job and
you are spending eight hours of every 24

1640
01:10:05,751 --> 01:10:08,750
hours a day working for someone,
you should make a living.

1641
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,480
You should be able to feed yourself
without worry.

1642
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:13,790
Clothe yourself.
I'm not talking about opulence,

1643
01:10:13,791 --> 01:10:16,430
I'm not talking about wealth driving a
Mercedes,

1644
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,190
but you should definitely be able to
take care of yourself should.

1645
01:10:19,191 --> 01:10:21,380
I think the problem with that when
people cause a lot,

1646
01:10:21,381 --> 01:10:23,660
I think a lot of people would agree with
that is it's always,

1647
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:26,090
well how are we going to,
who's going to pay for that?

1648
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:29,180
In other words,
the idea is right and then you go,

1649
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,150
where?
Where will the money come from to

1650
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:34,550
support making that a reality?
Well,

1651
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:36,110
I think the money's got to come.
I mean,

1652
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:38,120
it's gotta be profitable business,
right?

1653
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,920
Right.
So if you've got a profitable business,

1654
01:10:39,921 --> 01:10:44,000
how much of the profit goes to the
employees and how much of the profit

1655
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:45,820
goes to the owner of the business?
Sure.

1656
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,260
Like say if you have a diamond business,
right,

1657
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,620
and you're selling diamonds and your
employees are making $5 an hour,

1658
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,850
that's kind,
Kinda fucked up.

1659
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,850
You know,
like you're making millions and you're

1660
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,580
paying your employee $5 an hour.
What is it,

1661
01:10:58,581 --> 01:10:59,810
seven now,
what's the minimum?

1662
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:01,100
I have no idea.
See,

1663
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:04,400
and that's obviously an extreme example,
but in that extreme example,

1664
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:05,750
yeah,
man,

1665
01:11:05,751 --> 01:11:08,180
you need to pay more money to people who
work for you.

1666
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:11,000
If someone do,
if they didn't work for you,

1667
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,560
your job wouldn't work.

1668
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:16,470
Like you need someone say if you run a
car manufacturing business,

1669
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:17,304
right?
Yeah.

1670
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,880
If you don't have employees that put
together those cars,

1671
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:24,150
you literally don't have cars so you
don't have anything to sell.

1672
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:27,720
So you need to pay those fucking people
because they are the reason why your

1673
01:11:27,721 --> 01:11:29,520
car's getting made.
And if they do a good job,

1674
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:30,420
they should be paid.
Well,

1675
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,620
I totally agree with you.
I mean,

1676
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:32,610
nothing is,
it's,

1677
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:38,120
it's horrible when somebody applies
themselves to a job and can't sustain

1678
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,580
the minimum.
Yeah.

1679
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:41,410
Like having a place to live,
paying for food.

1680
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:42,510
It's terrible.
It's terrible.

1681
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,440
I totally agree.
I,

1682
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,330
I,
the only thing that I'm not smart enough

1683
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:47,280
to definitely figure out is,
well,

1684
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:49,260
what is that number?
And then,

1685
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:50,131
uh,
you know,

1686
01:11:50,131 --> 01:11:54,900
do you then dictate to different places
of business?

1687
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,510
It's got to be this number or it's gotta
be this percentage,

1688
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:58,320
at least,
you know.

1689
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,450
How do you,
how do you make it a reality?

1690
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,070
I don't know,
man.

1691
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,540
I do know that like Obamacare,
according to everyone that I know that

1692
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,910
runs a business is a fucking disaster,
really can.

1693
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,750
It's costing people way more money and
costing businesses way more money.

1694
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:16,690
I've yet to hear anybody make a
convincing argument why,

1695
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:19,110
why it works.
But on the other hand,

1696
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,070
I'm a fan of the idea of socialized
medicine.

1697
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,440
Sure.
I think that medicine should be just

1698
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:29,610
like the police and the fire department.
I think you should they the hoop that

1699
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:31,770
people who do it should be paid really
well.

1700
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:36,570
They should have an incentive to want
those jobs and the people should be able

1701
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:39,330
to get the services for free.
I really think that,

1702
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,610
I mean I think,
I don't,

1703
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:44,850
I'm not,
I'm not opposed to private doctors.

1704
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:45,410
Yeah.
Like if,

1705
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,081
if you're a,
say,

1706
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:47,820
if you're a bad ass fucking knee
surgeon,

1707
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:50,520
you work on the NBA and you work on all
these different people and you're just

1708
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:53,070
the best of what you do,
you should totally be able to work

1709
01:12:53,071 --> 01:12:53,904
privately.

1710
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:58,970
But the government could easily allocate
enough money to provide public health

1711
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:01,890
care.
It's just if it's been done in other

1712
01:13:01,891 --> 01:13:04,020
countries,
the fact that it can't be done here.

1713
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,540
[inaudible] it's been,
they do at other places.

1714
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,300
They don't do it well.
It's sucks in England.

1715
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:11,310
It fucking sucks.
Does it really?

1716
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,130
Everybody I talked to you that lives
over there and tell you it's a year.

1717
01:13:14,131 --> 01:13:16,680
If you hurt yourself,
you get surgery.

1718
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:19,170
You know,
cause people always cite Canada too.

1719
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:19,820
And I'm sure,
yeah,

1720
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,380
Canada is a joke too.
Well I know that,

1721
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,070
I know a couple of Canadian people that
when shit got serious,

1722
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:29,250
you know,
and they needed to see a cardiovascular

1723
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:32,280
surgeon and they talk about that weight.
They were like,

1724
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:34,500
fuck it,
let's fly over to the Mayo Clinic.

1725
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:35,353
And exactly.
You know,

1726
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,960
and then you shut off the money though.
Yeah.

1727
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:41,840
Then you have to come to America and you
have to pay for a hotel and airfare and

1728
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:43,740
who knows if you have that money.
Yeah,

1729
01:13:43,741 --> 01:13:46,170
I think,
I think there's gotta be some sort of a

1730
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,020
comfortable middle ground,
but it's got to be,

1731
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:51,510
well it's sort of like public school,
you know,

1732
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:54,420
like you can get educated in this
country if you don't have enough money.

1733
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:56,550
Right.
But is it a good education?

1734
01:13:56,580 --> 01:13:58,650
No,
a lot of parts is a lot of parts.

1735
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:02,310
Not a lot of parts of California and
Southern California,

1736
01:14:02,311 --> 01:14:05,460
Los Angeles,
one of the richest fucking cities and

1737
01:14:05,461 --> 01:14:09,450
all of the United States and the schools
are dog shit.

1738
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:11,883
Dog Shit

1739
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:15,370
terribly.
Shouldn't be an excuse for that.

1740
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,530
No,
but you know also you're dealing with

1741
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:18,364
crime.
Yeah.

1742
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:20,320
You're dealing with extreme levels of
poverty.

1743
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,980
Engineering that and trying to fix that
is not an easy task.

1744
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:29,130
But I just don't think you do that by
limiting the amount of underarm sprays

1745
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,730
or toothpastes are fucking the flavors
of ice cream or whatever the fuck you

1746
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:34,930
want to.
I don't see the,

1747
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,490
it doesn't make sense.
No,

1748
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:39,010
I just don't know.
I don't know if he's been a businessman

1749
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,210
ever.
You know,

1750
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:41,590
I think,
I don't think so.

1751
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:44,620
That's what I like about trump.
I don't like a lot of things about

1752
01:14:44,621 --> 01:14:46,660
trump.
I don't like how he talks about

1753
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:49,000
Mexicans.
That shit drives me crazy.

1754
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,730
I don't like,
I mean the idea of people sneaking over

1755
01:14:51,731 --> 01:14:53,110
here over the border like,
dude,

1756
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:56,080
how do you not have compassion?
And these fucking people are born a

1757
01:14:56,081 --> 01:14:58,680
third world country that's attached to
America.

1758
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,980
You know?
He knows what he's saying,

1759
01:14:59,981 --> 01:15:01,440
what he's doing that he's fucking
around.

1760
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:03,610
Well,
I think he's playing to what he knows.

1761
01:15:03,611 --> 01:15:05,740
We'll get people go,
you're goddamn right.

1762
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,190
You know that place.
Yeah.

1763
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,560
He knows that.
That's that saying those controversial

1764
01:15:12,430 --> 01:15:14,410
things that are going to get in the
paper.

1765
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:15,670
Also going to get people going.
Well,

1766
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:17,230
at least someone saying,
you know,

1767
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,120
I think he knows that.
I don't think it's an accident.

1768
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,790
Yeah.
I think you probably write in a lot of

1769
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:24,160
ways,
but I think he gets a big response from

1770
01:15:24,161 --> 01:15:26,530
that and then he feeds off that
response.

1771
01:15:26,531 --> 01:15:28,930
Loves it.
But he's a successful businessman.

1772
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:31,120
You know what's something,
someone told me though?

1773
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,360
It's really kind of fucked up.
If he took that money that his father

1774
01:15:34,361 --> 01:15:37,390
gave him,
his father gave him 2 million bucks to

1775
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:40,360
start his business.
If he took that money and put it in a

1776
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:41,780
mutual account,
uh,

1777
01:15:41,781 --> 01:15:45,490
it would be worth way more than he
currently is worth that.

1778
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:49,540
I do not believe I would really check
your friend pretty fucking hard.

1779
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:50,710
I was up.
I a friend,

1780
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,880
like someone told me on the hill,
if he makes that money in a fund,

1781
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,870
that would have been probably around 35
years ago,

1782
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:03,460
$2 million.
His net worth conservatively is around

1783
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:06,370
four and a half billion.
I mean,

1784
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:07,750
do you really think that,
uh,

1785
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:09,680
a mutual fund would have?
Well,

1786
01:16:09,681 --> 01:16:10,960
let's,
let's look at it.

1787
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:15,100
Jamie.
Why don't you a google that if Donald

1788
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:20,100
Trump took the money that his father
gave him and invested it and blank,

1789
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,930
there's whatever it is.
Yeah.

1790
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:22,840
I mean,
whatever that,

1791
01:16:22,841 --> 01:16:25,660
um,
whatever that equation is.

1792
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:27,790
Let's see.
If he would have bought apple stock,

1793
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,960
let me know.
Yeah,

1794
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:31,660
it would have been crazy.
I don't think it'd be four and a half.

1795
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:32,700
What about Google?
Oh,

1796
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:33,850
Shit.
Oh Shit.

1797
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:36,510
That was some big money.
I thought that,

1798
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,610
oh shit,
but you know it's funny is that he goes,

1799
01:16:39,611 --> 01:16:44,611
I'm worth 10 billion and Forbes did this
breakdown of all his assets,

1800
01:16:44,861 --> 01:16:45,611
and they go,
no,

1801
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:46,000
you're not.

1802
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:46,541
He goes,
yeah,

1803
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,830
I am.
And I get that.

1804
01:16:47,860 --> 01:16:50,170
That's kind of how he argues things is
go,

1805
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,190
yeah,
I am though.

1806
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,490
You know,
he doesn't have the substance right

1807
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,720
facts behind it.
He just says,

1808
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:56,471
yeah,
and they go,

1809
01:16:56,471 --> 01:16:57,251
why are you saying that?
He goes,

1810
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,110
because it sounds better.
It sounds better to be worth 10 than

1811
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:00,880
four and a half.
Did He admit that?

1812
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:04,270
He said that?
He said it's because it sounds better,

1813
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,770
and they said too.
In other words,

1814
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,500
if he were to make him worth 10 he would
have to,

1815
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:12,920
he was,
he'd be inflating the value of a lot of

1816
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:14,150
his holdings.
In other words,

1817
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:15,710
it's like saying,
well,

1818
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:20,711
I have this house and it's worth $65
million but nobody wants to buy it.

1819
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:21,681
They're like,
well,

1820
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:24,650
no,
houses in that neighborhood sell for

1821
01:17:24,651 --> 01:17:27,110
that.
They sell for 3 million and he goes,

1822
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:29,690
not mine,
my 65.

1823
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,810
And that's how he determines that he's
worth 10.

1824
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:35,120
I'm going to start doing that.
That's great.

1825
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:38,210
Just tell people no,
you're wrong.

1826
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:42,680
Yeah.
But I don't think he can hang at all

1827
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:47,950
with the elite politicians when it comes
to substance and knowing actual policy,

1828
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,560
knowing details.
That's a good point.

1829
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:55,100
But here's the question.
Is anybody who's running for president

1830
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,620
and elite politician?
Well,

1831
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:02,680
I mean you'd have to say that Hillary's
at least way more savvy and knows a lot

1832
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,540
more about how,
uh,

1833
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:08,660
certainly you know how the world works.
International Affairs.

1834
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:13,070
I mean she was secretary of state.
She knows the ins and outs of a lot of

1835
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,960
what you would assume.
She knows that,

1836
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:17,990
but wouldn't she know not to use a
private email account while she's

1837
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:19,710
secretary of state?
It's crazy.

1838
01:18:19,711 --> 01:18:21,800
She go to jail for that.
It's insane.

1839
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:23,900
That's something that if somebody wanted
to push,

1840
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:25,460
that's a crime.

1841
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:27,670
I don't,
you're not allowed to do this.

1842
01:18:27,671 --> 01:18:32,540
Still don't understand why even though
it's still discuss how you kind of get

1843
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,610
away with that.
Cause it just feels like I don't get it.

1844
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:38,060
But I mean she's certainly more savvy
politician.

1845
01:18:38,061 --> 01:18:41,120
I think that trump,
I don't know what his savvy though.

1846
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:46,310
Well cause he's saying shit that's led
him to a 39% lead over any other

1847
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:49,370
candidate in the Republican Party.
Remember when Ben Carson?

1848
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,670
Yeah.
It was like on the the cost line.

1849
01:18:51,671 --> 01:18:52,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

1850
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,920
He's,
he was ahead of them at one point in

1851
01:18:53,921 --> 01:18:54,260
time.
It,

1852
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:55,093
he was,
yeah,

1853
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,930
that all dry it up.
Yeah.

1854
01:18:56,990 --> 01:18:59,330
I don't know man.
I think people are really into the idea

1855
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:00,950
of the fantasy of a trump,
you know?

1856
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:04,280
But I still think if you get to a
debate,

1857
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,830
it's not that he wouldn't win.
Maybe he'd win,

1858
01:19:06,831 --> 01:19:08,030
but it would be based on,
well,

1859
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,080
you know,
you're a fucking loser.

1860
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,570
Like it's like that guy,
he says shit like that.

1861
01:19:11,571 --> 01:19:12,410
But it,
it's weird.

1862
01:19:12,411 --> 01:19:14,390
No one ever does that.
But it seems to work.

1863
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,220
It's that.
Yeah.

1864
01:19:16,221 --> 01:19:17,720
And then I,
then I guess you could argue,

1865
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:19,400
see he is savvy.
Yeah.

1866
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:20,600
But I mean,
you know,

1867
01:19:20,601 --> 01:19:22,970
I guess he's not savvy in the
traditional sense.

1868
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,560
I don't think he knows the INS and outs
of the way a lot of things work.

1869
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:29,180
I think his whole thing is,
look,

1870
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,400
I'm super successful and I'll get it
done.

1871
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,050
Yeah.
But the wildlife,

1872
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,990
lot of the ways that things work or kind
of bullshit,

1873
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,490
you know,
crony politics and influenced by

1874
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:45,950
gigantic corporations,
he doesn't have that same sort of

1875
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:47,960
influence cause he's independently
wealthy.

1876
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,730
Right.
There's a lot of weirdness to that.

1877
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:52,700
There is like special interest groups
don't really have the same sort of pull

1878
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:55,100
on him that they have on other people
know they can't own them.

1879
01:19:55,101 --> 01:19:57,050
They would never let him say the shit
that he's saying

1880
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,940
no.
And lots of put a wall between us and

1881
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:03,720
Mexico and call it the trump wall.
I just,

1882
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:06,650
his fucking name,
here's what doesn't use me anytime.

1883
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:07,200
If so,
if,

1884
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:07,980
if,
if this is

1885
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,360
CNN and [inaudible] your host of CNN
show and I'm somebody saying like,

1886
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:12,661
well,
you know,

1887
01:20:12,661 --> 01:20:15,750
trump is a,
he's completely unqualified in this

1888
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:16,890
claim.
He made his idiotic.

1889
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:22,160
He then tweets saw Tom Segura on CNN.
Guys always been a fucking loser for

1890
01:20:23,650 --> 01:20:27,300
whoever,
whoever says anything bad.

1891
01:20:27,301 --> 01:20:28,440
He'll be like,
yeah,

1892
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,960
saw his show last week,
not one laugh,

1893
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,360
exclamation point.
Like shit like that.

1894
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:36,210
He does that for everyone.
That's what Ronda Rousey,

1895
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,100
when Rhonda got knocked out,
he did.

1896
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:40,440
He said,
I'm glad she lost.

1897
01:20:40,441 --> 01:20:42,090
She was,
she's not a good person.

1898
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:45,000
Whoa.
And you know why I did that?

1899
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:49,320
Because she uh,
he had claimed that she was a trump

1900
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:51,600
supporter and then she said,
no,

1901
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,850
I support Bernie Sanders.
And he was like,

1902
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:54,810
Oh really?
Oh yeah.

1903
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:59,850
So when she lost it was like before that
he was saying that she was interested a

1904
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,530
supporter.
He was like all for it.

1905
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,900
Yeah.
Rhonda Rousey supports me and she was

1906
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,920
like,
the fuck I do.

1907
01:21:04,921 --> 01:21:06,120
And he's like,
she's not a good person.

1908
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,760
Glad you go off.
I'll lose her.

1909
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:11,460
Pretty interesting way of just a loser,
the loser,

1910
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:13,080
a loser,
but always been a loser.

1911
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,050
Bunch of losers.
Remember when she was,

1912
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:16,800
he was going back and forth and look at
that.

1913
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,480
Glad to see that Ronda Rousey lost her
championship fight last night was

1914
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:24,510
soundly beaten dash.
Not a nice person.

1915
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:27,110
The fuck are you talking about?
Well,

1916
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,840
what about you?
You're way more of a dick.

1917
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,820
She's at least not a nice person to sell
massive amounts of fucking paper view

1918
01:21:35,821 --> 01:21:36,654
sales.
Yeah.

1919
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,190
And,
and you know,

1920
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:42,600
be the protagonist.
He tweets about everybody.

1921
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,860
Uh,
the,

1922
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:46,800
if they write an article in the
Washington Post,

1923
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,860
the Washington Post,
which has been on the decline for years,

1924
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,310
had an article written by this loser.

1925
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:56,521
He writes.
I know.

1926
01:21:56,521 --> 01:21:58,680
It's pretty funny.
It's sad.

1927
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,860
Sad.
Not a nice person.

1928
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:05,580
Yeah,
you're fired.

1929
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:06,930
Like that's his whole thing.
You know,

1930
01:22:07,170 --> 01:22:09,160
I was a,
they gave me an offer to,

1931
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:11,730
to be on that show.
I was going to do it.

1932
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:13,620
I was thinking about,
really talked to him,

1933
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,600
the family,
like you guys want to live in New York

1934
01:22:15,601 --> 01:22:17,760
for a few months,
but um,

1935
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,740
you know,
they fire you in the beginning.

1936
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:22,200
They do all that.
You're fired stuff in the beginning.

1937
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:25,140
Oh really?
So you don't have a chance to go faulk

1938
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:26,490
you.
Oh really?

1939
01:22:26,491 --> 01:22:27,440
Yeah,
like before,

1940
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:30,420
before anyone knows anybody's fired,
he fires everybody.

1941
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,700
Tom,
you're fired.

1942
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:34,470
And then you get up and leave.
Jamie,

1943
01:22:34,530 --> 01:22:36,090
you're fired and you get up and walk
away.

1944
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,350
Joe,
you're fired.

1945
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:39,470
You get up and walk away and then they
do the show.

1946
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,051
Okay.
Yeah.

1947
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:42,900
So you don't,
you don't get a chance to say,

1948
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,080
let me tell you what I think about you
and your fucking plastic hair.

1949
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:48,600
You cunt.
You fucking sloppy dummy.

1950
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:51,240
Who got lucky.
That was probably done once and he was

1951
01:22:51,241 --> 01:22:52,590
like,
that's not going to happen again.

1952
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:55,680
Well probably right.
I think he probably planned for in

1953
01:22:55,681 --> 01:22:57,480
advance.
He's probably pretty good chess player.

1954
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:58,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

1955
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,520
I got to look like I'm always the king.
But they canceled that show after we

1956
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:04,650
talk shit about Mexicans.
Yeah.

1957
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,060
And macy's and

1958
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,840
did their partnership.
They had a whole line of,

1959
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:09,710
you know,
trump ties and shirts,

1960
01:23:09,711 --> 01:23:12,700
trump ties.
And they were like,

1961
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,320
we're done.
We're done with you.

1962
01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:19,530
And then Miss Universe threatened to,
or NBC threatened to not air his thing,

1963
01:23:20,820 --> 01:23:23,500
posted the contract and he was like,
I'll steal your balls off.

1964
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:27,290
You know,
NBC had a contract with him to Air Miss

1965
01:23:27,291 --> 01:23:27,941
Universe.
He,

1966
01:23:27,941 --> 01:23:29,500
he doesn't Miss Universe.
It's his,

1967
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:31,660
well he sold it,
but he owned,

1968
01:23:31,661 --> 01:23:36,661
he owned Miss Universe and maybe Miss
America to be on those various pageants.

1969
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:39,110
Yeah.
It's just to be around checks.

1970
01:23:39,111 --> 01:23:41,190
He like,
he literally thought those to be around

1971
01:23:41,191 --> 01:23:42,820
that shit.
For sure.

1972
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:46,210
For sure.
That's a good move on his part.

1973
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,960
It's a gangster move.
I'm a billionaire.

1974
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:49,310
I bought a pageant.
Hmm.

1975
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:52,360
Then he just,
I like the Czech Republic this year.

1976
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:53,223
Yeah.
What is this?

1977
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,640
I find it kind of like some more
information about what he inherited.

1978
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:57,480
Okay.
Uh,

1979
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:00,570
he was also,
when his father died in 1974,

1980
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,590
him and his siblings took over a $200
million real estate business,

1981
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:08,910
which he may have gotten around $40
million of the bottom of this says if he

1982
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:12,570
invested that and since 1974 and the s
and p 500,

1983
01:24:12,571 --> 01:24:14,220
he could be worth around 3 billion
today.

1984
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,380
Okay.
So it kind of makes sense.

1985
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:18,420
Right.
But that's also 40 million,

1986
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,480
not to just the one or whatever he was
given.

1987
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:25,110
And what does it say?
So it was current claim network of 8.7

1988
01:24:25,111 --> 01:24:29,820
billion would equate to around 120
million in 1974 which is right in the

1989
01:24:29,821 --> 01:24:34,821
middle estimates of what he inherited.
So that means if he invested that,

1990
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:38,090
that doesn't make any sense.
That's confused.

1991
01:24:38,091 --> 01:24:43,091
It says the s and P is up 74 or 74 fold
since 1974 I see you didn't do anything

1992
01:24:43,981 --> 01:24:46,230
and just left it there.
It'd be about 120 million.

1993
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:49,140
But if he did other chances and other
got good business,

1994
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:51,480
things went well for him.
It could be worth up to three.

1995
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,010
Okay,
so what they're saying is here,

1996
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:57,300
here's a clear example,
says if he had invested the 40 million

1997
01:24:57,570 --> 01:25:02,570
in an s and p 500 index fund,
he'd be worth about 3 billion today,

1998
01:25:02,791 --> 01:25:07,410
which is in line with the third party
estimates of 3 billion and 4 billion,

1999
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,830
which is his net worth.
So they estimate between three and 4

2000
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:11,280
billion.
Yeah.

2001
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,270
Yeah.
Which is probably right.

2002
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:14,100
Still baller.

2003
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,020
Well are still baller,
doesn't have to listen.

2004
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,020
You can do whatever he wants.
How fucking good.

2005
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,190
I liked it.
He's making a mockery of the whole

2006
01:25:21,191 --> 01:25:22,810
thing.
I like a lot of things about him.

2007
01:25:22,811 --> 01:25:25,030
I in apparently Jeff Ross who,
uh,

2008
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,630
did the trump rose says he's a good guy.
So you talked to him.

2009
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:30,940
He's a good guy.
Like he knows what he's doing.

2010
01:25:30,970 --> 01:25:34,980
You know a lot of this like fucking
fanfare and this craziness and all this

2011
01:25:34,981 --> 01:25:38,170
shit that he's doing.
He's mocking this stupid fucking system.

2012
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,050
He's a smart guy.
He knows what he's doing.

2013
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,363
I mean,
look,

2014
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:46,370
he's talked shit about Mexicans and he's
still the fucking front runner in a

2015
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,010
giant way.
He's like,

2016
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:50,680
well,
someone's raping someone's birding and

2017
01:25:50,681 --> 01:25:52,750
we're going to let a bunch of rapists
and murderers over there.

2018
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:55,270
I'm sure you said Pete,
everyone over there is a rapist and

2019
01:25:55,271 --> 01:25:55,450
rent.

2020
01:25:55,450 --> 01:25:56,350
Well,
someone's raping.

2021
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,790
Yeah.
Who's doing all the,

2022
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:00,970
but he's just like,
he says crazy shit like that and like

2023
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:06,320
hits it flies in the face of,
look what happened to that poor fuck the

2024
01:26:06,381 --> 01:26:08,090
Mormon.
What the fuck's his name?

2025
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,400
Uh,
that ran for president last time.

2026
01:26:10,490 --> 01:26:12,320
I know you're the fuck's his name.
Romney.

2027
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,540
That poor fuck.
All he said was,

2028
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:17,930
we don't have to pay attention to the
47% that aren't going to vote for us.

2029
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,020
Yeah.
The the lower 47% that make little

2030
01:26:21,021 --> 01:26:22,430
money,
they're not going to vote for us in the

2031
01:26:22,431 --> 01:26:23,630
first place,
so let's not pay attention.

2032
01:26:23,631 --> 01:26:26,360
Then that tanked his business.
That tanked.

2033
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:27,500
It tanked it.
They're like,

2034
01:26:27,501 --> 01:26:28,610
it's over.
It's over,

2035
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:30,110
bitch.
I know it's over.

2036
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:32,210
How about Howard Dean?
All we did was cheer

2037
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:35,340
and that was it.
That was it.

2038
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:37,760
You fragile bitch.
You can't even cheer.

2039
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:40,730
You can't cheer.
He can't scream and trump can say

2040
01:26:40,731 --> 01:26:43,520
mexicans are rapists and everybody's
like,

2041
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:46,550
Ooh,
El Chapo wants to Muslims at the border.

2042
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:49,640
Yeah,
we should stop letting him in so crazy.

2043
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:52,130
Like this is a country founded by
letting people in.

2044
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:54,380
Did you?
Only way this country got filled is

2045
01:26:54,381 --> 01:26:56,270
letting people in,
not old people.

2046
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:00,740
These people are running.
They're leaving their country because

2047
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,620
radical Muslim terrorists if taken over
it.

2048
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,850
Yeah.
What was that?

2049
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,380
His new ad.
The first ad came out.

2050
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:08,243
This,
what is it?

2051
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:12,710
What is it?
His first ad.

2052
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:16,400
Oh my God,
you're kidding.

2053
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,510
But this was the beginning of Craig it

2054
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:22,020
and I approve this message.
The politicians can pretend it's

2055
01:27:22,021 --> 01:27:24,850
something else,
but Donald Trump calls it radical

2056
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:28,330
Islamic terrorism.
That's why he's calling for a temporary

2057
01:27:28,331 --> 01:27:32,110
shutdown of Muslims entering the United
States until we can figure out what's

2058
01:27:32,111 --> 01:27:35,150
going on,
you'll quickly cut the head off my sis

2059
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:39,400
and take their oil and he'll stop
illegal immigration by building a wall

2060
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:42,520
on our southern border that Mexico will
pay for it.

2061
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:49,200
Wow.
Okay.

2062
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,220
Okay.
He got flack for that shot of the people

2063
01:27:53,221 --> 01:27:55,170
running.
That's not where they were from there.

2064
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:57,190
That was a shot of Morocco.
Yeah.

2065
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:58,020
Yeah.
It's pretty fun.

2066
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:00,080
It's not America.
It's not running across about,

2067
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,430
he'll so just get me some brown people
running.

2068
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:04,770
Any Brown people running in black and
white footage.

2069
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:06,270
We'll take it.
Yeah.

2070
01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:08,130
Yeah.
He's entertaining.

2071
01:28:08,190 --> 01:28:10,680
I will give him that as a show.
This is a fun show to watch.

2072
01:28:10,681 --> 01:28:14,070
It's the best show ever.
I hope him and Hillary debate.

2073
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:17,820
I hope he gets to debate on the long
side cause I think he'll crush her.

2074
01:28:17,850 --> 01:28:21,840
Do you think your husband will be back
in the White House getting blow jobs

2075
01:28:21,900 --> 01:28:23,150
like he was?
Oh yeah.

2076
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,350
He's going to throw some grenades.
Oh,

2077
01:28:25,351 --> 01:28:28,470
sure.
He doesn't give a fuck detonate some.

2078
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:29,610
Yeah,
it will be awesome.

2079
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,980
It will be anything.
Ben Carson should be involved too,

2080
01:28:31,981 --> 01:28:35,880
just to tell us that the earth is 10,000
years old and Jesus wrote a Unicorn.

2081
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:36,810
Yeah.
Through the fucking,

2082
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:41,640
that garden of Eden.
Doctor fucking awesome.

2083
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,250
Doctor Brain's amazing.
Neurosurgeon,

2084
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:48,120
one of the greatest neurosurgeons this
country has ever produced that really,

2085
01:28:48,121 --> 01:28:49,470
that,
that accomplished.

2086
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,480
Oh,
100% yeah,

2087
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:51,660
and he doesn't believe in evolution.

2088
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,050
Well,
he believes,

2089
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:55,711
he'll say,
well,

2090
01:28:55,711 --> 01:28:58,230
I believe in certain types of
evolutions.

2091
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:01,140
He's got a,
I don't think he's a 10,000 year guy.

2092
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:03,300
I don't think he's one of the young
Earth Christians,

2093
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,360
but Sarah Pailin was,
Sarah Pailin,

2094
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:08,760
talked to allegedly,
obviously this is all anecdotal,

2095
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:13,761
but she allegedly talk to a librarian in
Alaska and told the library and that she

2096
01:29:14,671 --> 01:29:18,660
saw photos on the Internet of a dinosaur
footprint with a human footprint inside

2097
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:20,490
of it.
What?

2098
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,510
Which means dinosaurs and people were in
the same area.

2099
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:25,530
Walking.
Is that on?

2100
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,670
Is that recorded?
That said,

2101
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:28,740
oh,
it'd be amazing if it was.

2102
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:30,960
Yeah.
A lot of young Earth Christians,

2103
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:32,240
man.
How did the how,

2104
01:29:32,370 --> 01:29:34,920
I don't know the argument of that they
make for,

2105
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:37,200
you know,
carbon footprinting things cause that's

2106
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:38,610
how shit,
that's just a bullshit.

2107
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:42,210
Losers.
Not a nice person.

2108
01:29:42,211 --> 01:29:43,044
Yeah.
Oh,

2109
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,670
that guy that said,
that's fucking dog.

2110
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,590
I know you're talking about,
he's always been a loser.

2111
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:49,110
I'm waiting for the day when no one runs
for president.

2112
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:52,500
I'm waiting for the day where the
fucking roster everybody gives up.

2113
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:56,490
It's like as soon as we can read minds
and figure out exactly what people,

2114
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:58,560
what their intention is and what their
past is,

2115
01:29:58,561 --> 01:30:01,470
and you have to sign up for the mind
reading machine in order for to be

2116
01:30:01,471 --> 01:30:03,360
president.
That's going to be the end.

2117
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,690
There was,
eh,

2118
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:09,630
it's rap.
I do think I look at it so much

2119
01:30:09,631 --> 01:30:11,580
differently now at this age.
When I see people,

2120
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:12,414
I'm like,
you're just,

2121
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:14,980
they're all just egomaniacs.
Oh yeah.

2122
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:18,230
Their egos are climbing out of their
skin to,

2123
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:21,570
to want to be,
to go through that to be the president.

2124
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:25,140
Well,
Obama's publicly stated that it's not

2125
01:30:25,141 --> 01:30:27,300
what he thought it was.
And then all these people that are

2126
01:30:27,301 --> 01:30:31,680
lining up to do it like Filson the fame
wears off as what he said and that

2127
01:30:31,681 --> 01:30:35,850
people criticized him by taking that
quote out of context and showing a bunch

2128
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:38,230
of pictures of him with famous people
smiling and laughing,

2129
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:42,650
handing out with Jay z and rich people
and ha ha ha.

2130
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,910
Ah,
and then there was this whole story

2131
01:30:44,911 --> 01:30:45,750
about his,
uh,

2132
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:49,110
vacations.
How much is vacations costs while he was

2133
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,450
in the White House?
The president's vacations cost a ton.

2134
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:52,470
Yeah,
of course they will.

2135
01:30:52,471 --> 01:30:57,030
They have to fly in air force one and
they got secret service vehicles.

2136
01:30:57,031 --> 01:30:57,590
Yeah,
of course.

2137
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,310
Yeah.
Well they have bulletproof cars.

2138
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:00,420
Yeah.
I have to,

2139
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:04,680
what was his Hawaiian vacations?
Apparently during his time in the White

2140
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,660
House,
it's been $70 million.

2141
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:10,580
Taxpayers had to pay a lot of money.
It's a little pricey.

2142
01:31:10,581 --> 01:31:11,414
He's,
it's great.

2143
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,830
It is a little pricey,
but you know,

2144
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,930
it's kind of trumped up man.
We had a great time on that trip number.

2145
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:18,990
Often he was golfing 70 million.
Not a trip we took.

2146
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:22,680
Yeah,
I mean he was golfing like when the San

2147
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:26,650
Bernandino murders were taking place,
he went golfing out.

2148
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:28,980
There was a little skinny legs picking
up golf balls.

2149
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:30,790
Yeah,
it doesn't do any squats do.

2150
01:31:30,790 --> 01:31:33,000
There's a shooting going on man.
I'm trying to play this back.

2151
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:34,140
Nine if you like,
give me a second.

2152
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,870
Why do they all play golf?
Can you be president?

2153
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:39,840
There's two things you can't be if you
want to be president.

2154
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:42,840
You can't be someone who doesn't believe
in God when you can't be someone who

2155
01:31:42,841 --> 01:31:44,670
doesn't play golf.
Um,

2156
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:46,920
I think we're about to see maybe a
change of that.

2157
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:48,960
What Hillary,
I don't think the pictures,

2158
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,710
she's going to be golf.
And if she wins Bernie,

2159
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:53,280
do you think if he won he would play?
First of all,

2160
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,940
I'll make golf illegal and I'll turn off
the place of intense places where the

2161
01:31:56,941 --> 01:31:58,290
homeless people,
yeah,

2162
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,760
would be like these courses,
a waste of space.

2163
01:32:00,761 --> 01:32:01,720
They are.
Yeah.

2164
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:04,690
The cough is,
I don't have a good Bernie impression.

2165
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,290
I need to get a good brand seen.
I think it James [inaudible] who was at

2166
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:09,970
the,
he's a comic and an actor.

2167
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,720
He doesn't find it.
How do you spell his last name?

2168
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,630
I think it's a d.
O.

2169
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:17,463
M I.
A N.

2170
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:18,623
[inaudible]

2171
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,130
james a domain.
I think that's it.

2172
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,010
Oh,
you know what else does a good one?

2173
01:32:24,011 --> 01:32:25,900
Really funny.
Steven crowder,

2174
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:31,120
he calls Bernie clause.
Steven crowder fucking mocks Bernie

2175
01:32:31,121 --> 01:32:32,140
pretty heavy.
Really?

2176
01:32:32,260 --> 01:32:33,220
Yeah.
He's pretty funny.

2177
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,490
And this is a Bernie clause impression
crap.

2178
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:37,710
You know,
crowder is,

2179
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:40,210
and he's kind of like an internet
comedian,

2180
01:32:40,211 --> 01:32:42,550
but politically conservative.
He does.

2181
01:32:42,551 --> 01:32:44,230
Uh,
he did a really funny thing.

2182
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,720
You know,
social justice warriors are always

2183
01:32:46,721 --> 01:32:50,770
saying that you should ask people what
their correct gender pronouns are

2184
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:55,980
because some people like to useZ and h I
r and all these different that

2185
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:58,360
nonconventional gender pronouns because
they,

2186
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:01,630
they're either gender queer and uh,
they don't,

2187
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:06,640
they don't want to be labeled in a
specific male or female gender.

2188
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:09,270
You're set up for this as exhausting to
you.

2189
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:14,350
Now
I want to punch whoever fucking told you

2190
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:18,490
this.
It's the worst thing I've ever heard.

2191
01:33:21,040 --> 01:33:24,190
I'm having an aneurysm right now
thinking about where this is going to

2192
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:28,710
go.
See your pay attention to throat,

2193
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:33,400
zillow
and I'm paying attention to ridiculous

2194
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:38,460
social requirements that people in
college today or we're asking people to

2195
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:42,280
do and they want people to ask other
people's social,

2196
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:42,971
uh,
you know,

2197
01:33:42,971 --> 01:33:46,990
like they have like this real rigid idea
of how you supposed to behave socially

2198
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:49,600
and you're supposed to ask their
preferred gender pronouns.

2199
01:33:49,810 --> 01:33:52,900
Like,
I can't just assume that you are a man.

2200
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:55,330
I have to ask you.
I'm not kidding.

2201
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:56,740
You know,
there's a guy,

2202
01:33:56,741 --> 01:34:00,460
we had this guy on who was a guest who
said that one of his colleagues was,

2203
01:34:00,520 --> 01:34:04,390
I think it was fired because he refused
to this.

2204
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:08,710
He had a student in his class that would
change his gender pronoun from him to

2205
01:34:08,711 --> 01:34:11,230
her and her to him.
And it would go back forth,

2206
01:34:11,260 --> 01:34:13,960
back and forth depending on what days of
the week.

2207
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,170
Like some days he wanted to be a girl
and some days he wanted to be a boy.

2208
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:19,300
And this,
this professor was not willing to do

2209
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:20,560
that.
And so he was fired.

2210
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:23,260
Good for the professor.
That's one where I a hundred percent

2211
01:34:23,261 --> 01:34:26,500
support.
If you're going back and forth on today,

2212
01:34:26,501 --> 01:34:30,520
she is here and tomorrow he might be
back tomorrow.

2213
01:34:30,521 --> 01:34:33,280
I'mZ ,
I'm not her z.

2214
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,580
And then the next day I'm hr her.
All right.

2215
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:38,100
I give the fuck up.
Well,

2216
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:42,670
you know,
Harvard released a list of possible

2217
01:34:42,671 --> 01:34:46,960
gender pronouns and so they sent it home
with people to like,

2218
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:52,380
I want you to be aware of these
potential gender pronouns and gender

2219
01:34:52,391 --> 01:34:56,890
neutral pronouns that you should be
aware of that people want them to use.

2220
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:57,830
Fuck me.

2221
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:06,140
I would just
walk around.

2222
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:07,340
I would go,
he,

2223
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:08,210
and then if someone's like,
no,

2224
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:09,044
I'd be like,
whatever.

2225
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:12,210
Sorry.
Sorry.

2226
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:15,050
You're right.
Hey Jesus.

2227
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:17,990
You can't have a fucking Thompson Jura
style beard and b,

2228
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:21,730
she,
her maybe he z your Z,

2229
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:22,750

Z.

2231
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:26,840
Sigora mister,

2232
01:35:26,841 --> 01:35:27,710
No,
no.

2233
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,660
Well,
when he was in class,

2234
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,710
oh,
excuse me.

2235
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,640
When Zee Zee was in class when her was
in class.

2236
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:38,690
Chai are there really are using uh oh

01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:41,353
H.
Here it is.

2239
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:44,870
Gender Binary.
These are gender binary.

2240
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:48,380
He,
she hurt him but gender neutral.

2241
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:51,620
Are they them?
Theirs like some people on their twitter

2242
01:35:51,621 --> 01:35:55,640
page to have a preferred gender.
Pronouns use pronouns.

2243
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:57,560
Zi Hr,

2244
01:35:57,610 --> 01:35:59,950

01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,820
How about here?
Pronunciation.

2250
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,940
H I r is here.
It's not even her.

2251
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:10,970
Z.
Z are zeroes.

2252
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:15,140
Zeroes,
sometimes z.

2253
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:17,050
If you get crazy,
they spell it with an x.

2254
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:19,050
Z.
It's like another class.

2255
01:36:19,051 --> 01:36:20,970
I would have failed because I would
really,

2256
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:26,100
I a run right through the fucking door.
You never even bothered to open it me

2257
01:36:26,830 --> 01:36:28,370
out.
Oh,

2258
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:31,450
I would've been like the Kool aid guy.
I would have left my outline like in the

2259
01:36:31,451 --> 01:36:32,160
car.

2260
01:36:32,160 --> 01:36:32,993
Yes.

2261
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:34,850
Gone.
I'm gone.

2262
01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:36,133
I'm not doing it,
man.

2263
01:36:36,410 --> 01:36:39,410
I'm really not though.
What the fuck man,

2264
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:42,080
what is going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

2265
01:36:42,650 --> 01:36:45,530
Everybody got a trophy participation
trophies.

2266
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:46,850
Yeah,
I'm against that for sure.

2267
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:49,310
That's what did it.
Everybody got attention for who they

2268
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:50,900
are.
I'm amazing on my own,

2269
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:51,650
right.
No,

2270
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:53,260
I'm here.
I'm Zaire.

2271
01:36:53,320 --> 01:36:54,620
How remember,
you know,

2272
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,750
losing games and,
and,

2273
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,390
and it sucked.
That was part of the thing is that you

2274
01:36:59,391 --> 01:37:00,350
remember,
it sucks.

2275
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:01,880
Yeah.
Well that's why winning is awesome.

2276
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:03,220
Yeah.
Winning is awesome.

2277
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:04,820
Not a loser.
Yeah.

2278
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:06,290
Yeah.
When no one's a loser,

2279
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,940
winning is an awesome anymore.
Right.

2280
01:37:08,140 --> 01:37:10,070
Cause everybody gets participation
trophies.

2281
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:11,240
No.
Yeah.

2282
01:37:11,241 --> 01:37:12,830
Well My,
my daughter when she was three,

2283
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:14,990
she was playing soccer and no one won.
I was like,

2284
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:17,390
what do you mean no one won?
This team scored five,

2285
01:37:17,391 --> 01:37:18,560
that team scored zero.

2286
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,120
That team fucking one.
Nope.

2287
01:37:20,180 --> 01:37:22,190
We don't celebrate that.
I have,

2288
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,350
I'm going to look into,
uh,

2289
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:28,160
a League for my kid that definitely has
winners and losers.

2290
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:29,330
Oh yeah,
for sure.

2291
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:30,590
Yeah.
Well,

2292
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:33,590
when my daughter played softball too,
and she was six,

2293
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:37,060
this was not even the young,
the three year old that when,

2294
01:37:37,061 --> 01:37:38,990
uh,
my seven year old was six.

2295
01:37:39,140 --> 01:37:41,300
She was playing softball and they didn't
count the score.

2296
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:44,690
I don't get it.
Then they would run and everybody high

2297
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:45,141
five,
everybody,

2298
01:37:45,141 --> 01:37:46,760
nobody count score.
They wouldn't count.

2299
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:49,490
It's just about playing the bullshit.
Bullshit.

2300
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:50,660
What?
What's the point in hitting the ball

2301
01:37:50,661 --> 01:37:51,494
then?
Yeah.

2302
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:55,070
How about we just throw the ball around?
How about you just hit balls randomly?

2303
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:56,310
Someone's pitching,

2304
01:37:56,310 --> 01:37:58,050
you're trying to hit it.
If you don't hit it,

2305
01:37:58,051 --> 01:37:59,340
you're a loser.
Okay.

2306
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:02,550
Yeah,
you suck at this.

2307
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:06,420
You know what?
I sucked at tee ball or the ball sits on

2308
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:09,840
the t and it doesn't move.
I had trouble with that.

2309
01:38:10,020 --> 01:38:11,460
I couldn't hold.
That's the other thing they do with

2310
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:13,230
kids.
If they can't hit the pitch,

2311
01:38:13,231 --> 01:38:14,700
they gave him a couple of pitches and
they can't hit it.

2312
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,780
Then they put it on a little stick and
they let the,

2313
01:38:16,790 --> 01:38:19,860
they set it up for them and they hit it
and they get them on base for sure.

2314
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:21,060
Yeah,
and a lot of them,

2315
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:23,370
they don't mean hit the fucking stealing
with the ball.

2316
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:26,400
They hit the stick itself and the ball
falls down and they just start running

2317
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:29,750
like they just won the world series.
Yeah.

2318
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:32,170
I got an a tee ball pretty quick,
you know,

2319
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:33,510
I was like,
I suck at this shit.

2320
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:34,260
[inaudible]

2321
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:37,260
I was bad at every sport until I did
martial arts.

2322
01:38:37,261 --> 01:38:39,810
I was pretty okay at baseball,
but uh,

2323
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:44,100
I wasn't a good baseball player because
I wouldn't listen to the coach ever.

2324
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:46,170
They would say go on there and try to
hit a single.

2325
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,340
Okay.
Whatever.

2326
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:49,810
And I get up to home run every time.
Yeah.

2327
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:51,930
Every time.
Swing for the bleachers.

2328
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:54,510
You know why?
Cause I hit a couple of them and it was

2329
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:55,500
awesome.
The best,

2330
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:59,640
when you feel that,
take that crack of the bat and that ball

2331
01:38:59,641 --> 01:39:01,350
starts flying through the air,
you like,

2332
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:05,100
Yay.
Sweet spot feeling man.

2333
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:09,930
There's that feeling that you only get
when you hit a home run course.

2334
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,520
You don't get that feeling when you get
on base.

2335
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:12,570
No.
That's like,

2336
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,081
oh,
okay.

2337
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:14,940
I'm not a loser.
When you get on base,

2338
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:16,110
you're like,
I'm not a loser one.

2339
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:16,944
Yeah.

2340
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,150
You watched that thing fucking sale
under the bleachers.

2341
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:22,470
You're a winner.
Winner.

2342
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,300
Now you're a winner.
Yo One.

2343
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,980
I agree in a home run,
he'd come back,

2344
01:39:25,981 --> 01:39:28,110
everybody's high fiving you.
And the coach is like,

2345
01:39:28,111 --> 01:39:29,160
I told you,
get on base.

2346
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:31,830
You could fuck all the way off,
dummy.

2347
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:34,080
I just hit a home run.
Yeah,

2348
01:39:34,081 --> 01:39:36,360
that's why in in football,
they always tried to teach you that when

2349
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:37,740
you tackle to wrap up,
you know,

2350
01:39:37,741 --> 01:39:40,260
they're like lower your body,
head to the side,

2351
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:43,410
shoulder into the chest,
and then you wrap up.

2352
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:46,110
But you know what you try to do?
You Try to light people up,

2353
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,120
throw fucking,
and you miss,

2354
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:51,600
you know the guy who bounces off of it.
But every once in a while you lay

2355
01:39:51,601 --> 01:39:54,270
somebody the fuck out and you're like,
what's up now?

2356
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:57,780
So that's,
that's why you do that.

2357
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:58,680
You know,
he goes,

2358
01:39:58,681 --> 01:39:59,401
what?
You do that?

2359
01:39:59,401 --> 01:40:01,170
What the fuck is wrong with these
coaches?

2360
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:06,320
Coach raising a bunch of pussies,
they want to be called Z or her or Zarr

2361
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:08,610
Shit is zero.
Zero.

2362
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:09,481
Um,
well,

2363
01:40:09,481 --> 01:40:11,090
let's see the Bernie impression.
We have it.

2364
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,090
Yeah.
Do we fire it up?

2365
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,570
What's his name again?
James a doe Meehan.

2366
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,980
Where's he at?
He's,

2367
01:40:16,981 --> 01:40:18,120
he's here.
He's an La guy.

2368
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,073
Oh,
okay.

2369
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:21,300
Paul,
let's go full screen on this bitch.

2370
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:23,820
Give James a domains.
So props.

2371
01:40:23,821 --> 01:40:24,360

2372
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:25,193
he's funny,
Dude.

2373
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:30,290
Partisan that Donald Trump versus Bernie
Sanders

2374
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,790
walling
for president,

2375
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:43,430
but I thought of the Moody of Military
Coup de Paul for like we all know power

2376
01:40:47,140 --> 01:40:52,140
all pro football.
That's really good.

2377
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:57,184
It's really good.

2378
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:23,110
This is a great country.
This is a great country.

2379
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:26,290
This is a fun place.
It's pretty good too.

2380
01:41:26,291 --> 01:41:29,080
Yeah,
and I promise I'm killing everyone in

2381
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:30,640
the bowls.
I can guarantee this.

2382
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,490
I'm killing everyone in the post and if
I'm elected president,

2383
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:38,610
I will kill everyone.
Listen fast.

2384
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:41,830
Okay.
The minute I'm become president at the

2385
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:45,940
anchor baby program where we start
bronzing Mexican immigrants and putting

2386
01:41:45,941 --> 01:41:48,840
them on naval ships put to use.
Finally,

2387
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:54,280
I'm just saying bronze and make it a
real thing.

2388
01:41:54,281 --> 01:41:56,290
No,
it's no longer in events and metaphor.

2389
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:04,670
You'll look like a warning shot
here

2390
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:11,140
on the left to the right.
It's two weeks were how out in a car.

2391
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:16,180
Fairly mature.
Hold on.

2392
01:42:16,181 --> 01:42:19,000
Happened while I was simultaneously
buying stock

2393
01:42:22,070 --> 01:42:25,030
pile.
Where are your final courteous way

2394
01:42:25,031 --> 01:42:27,660
completely blow up.
I have more hair,

2395
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,540
but I didn't want to ask.

2396
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:36,480
That's great.
And so I don't know the trump guys name,

2397
01:42:36,481 --> 01:42:37,061
but he's great.
Yeah.

2398
01:42:37,061 --> 01:42:39,820
What is his name was the trump press.
If you highlight the video yet.

2399
01:42:39,900 --> 01:42:41,430
Anthony,
what is it,

2400
01:42:42,330 --> 01:42:47,330
James Alimony in a domain.
A domain to me at a manwich boy.

2401
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:50,280
Yeah.
Both immigrants.

2402
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:52,050
Obviously names.
Yeah.

2403
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,040
Probably Muslim terrorists snuck problem
probably.

2404
01:42:56,490 --> 01:42:58,530
That's funny.
He doesn't really get trump to,

2405
01:42:58,590 --> 01:42:59,580
yeah,
that's good.

2406
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,260
That trump is good.
It's really good.

2407
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,540
Put that fucking Bernie Sanders is on
point.

2408
01:43:03,541 --> 01:43:06,810
It really is a long haul.
And talking about the percentages of the

2409
01:43:06,811 --> 01:43:08,610
percentage,
he got the uh,

2410
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,710
the substance of it down to,
well,

2411
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:12,750
everybody's looking for somebody that
comes along.

2412
01:43:12,751 --> 01:43:16,710
It stands out as being the counter to
what we're experiencing,

2413
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:17,550
you know?
Yeah.

2414
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:20,250
No one feels like any of these people
represent them,

2415
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:24,930
except maybe Ted Cruz fans is a few
fucking a few Weirdos.

2416
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:27,630
I liked the guys that still stay in it,
you know,

2417
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:31,320
when they know there's not even a shot
of that level of denial.

2418
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:33,120
There's,
you're just in denial.

2419
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:34,890
It was a pride thing.
Yeah.

2420
01:43:34,891 --> 01:43:37,680
But there's a certain point where you
know there's not,

2421
01:43:37,681 --> 01:43:39,180
it's not going to turn around and they
still like,

2422
01:43:39,181 --> 01:43:40,014
I'm,
I don't know,

2423
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:41,760
I'm still got a shot.
You know,

2424
01:43:41,761 --> 01:43:43,250
you don't have a shot.
I mean,

2425
01:43:43,290 --> 01:43:44,910
is Jeff still in it?
She's still in it.

2426
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:47,760
I think jeb is land back.
This is my thought.

2427
01:43:48,090 --> 01:43:51,830
My thought is jeb is rope a dope and
he's letting all these people beat each

2428
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:52,040
other

2429
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:56,780
up and he's laying way back and I think
he's going to be the eventual Republican

2430
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:58,140
nominee.
That's exactly.

2431
01:43:58,550 --> 01:43:59,520
Yeah.
It doesn't meet.

2432
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:00,830
His numbers are terrible,
aren't they?

2433
01:44:00,831 --> 01:44:01,550
I mean,
Yup.

2434
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:03,680
And he's not trying,
I'm not trying to do anything about it.

2435
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:05,480
It's got a long way to go.
Yeah.

2436
01:44:05,810 --> 01:44:07,280
November.
Right.

2437
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:11,930
Which is almost a year from now.
Think about what can happen publicly in

2438
01:44:11,931 --> 01:44:13,070
a year,
in a year.

2439
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:16,970
People become superstars from no name to
superstars in this world.

2440
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,840
The world we're experiencing today.
Yeah,

2441
01:44:18,890 --> 01:44:21,110
that's true.
This is a different world.

2442
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:25,670
Like you gotta be careful.
And if you're a media savvy guy,

2443
01:44:25,730 --> 01:44:28,970
and I got to assume that anybody who
grows up where his fucking dad was

2444
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:31,760
president and his brother was president.
Boy,

2445
01:44:31,761 --> 01:44:35,030
if anybody understands that business,
it's him and Hillary.

2446
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:37,460
Yeah.
He looks so tired.

2447
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,760
She looks like she's exhausted.
She looks exhausted.

2448
01:44:40,761 --> 01:44:42,770
She looks super unhealthy.

2449
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:44,390
Here's a thought.
Ready?

2450
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:51,160
Hillary Clinton
and Christie Brinkley or essentially the

2451
01:44:51,771 --> 01:44:54,380
same age,
are they,

2452
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,570
aren't they?
I Dunno.

2453
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:59,090
I bet they are.
I bet they're fucking clothes.

2454
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:01,250
Who would you rather hookup with a
hillary?

2455
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:02,390
Just for the story.
Yeah.

2456
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,140
That's good.
Sorry,

2457
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:04,310
Christie Brinkley.
It's like,

2458
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:05,930
so you're gonna Marie,
your Bro.

2459
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,340
Yeah.
Well the hillary like,

2460
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:09,070
Hey,
what were you thinking dude?

2461
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:14,160
Christie Brinkley
fuck had Viagara in me.

2462
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:18,020
Yeah,
I did 200 milligrams of Viagara.

2463
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:21,290
I did 10 lines of coke.
I drank a bottle of Tequila.

2464
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,670
I was on ecstasy and mushrooms.
She's,

2465
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:29,180
she's had a real dog too,
so she's had some savage sex,

2466
01:45:29,181 --> 01:45:29,721
I think.
You know,

2467
01:45:29,721 --> 01:45:30,710
I think so.
Sure.

2468
01:45:30,740 --> 01:45:32,630
She probably hasn't been fucked in
forever.

2469
01:45:32,980 --> 01:45:35,480
That's probably been a lesbian for the
left 30 or 40 years.

2470
01:45:35,810 --> 01:45:37,520
At least.
Just hangs in there with them.

2471
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,150
They made a deal.
I think they made a deal.

2472
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:42,470
She just take a picture to get a might
know.

2473
01:45:42,580 --> 01:45:44,030
What the fuck do I know?
Talking Shit.

2474
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:47,990
But I got to assume at,
first of all,

2475
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:50,390
if you got a guy like bill,
you get to know him.

2476
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:52,880
You know that dude's a freak.
He's a whip.

2477
01:45:52,881 --> 01:45:54,690
His Dick out type freak.
Oh yeah.

2478
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:55,970
He's one of those guys like,
Hey,

2479
01:45:55,971 --> 01:45:57,420
how are you?
Whoa,

2480
01:45:58,110 --> 01:45:59,320
whoa.
That's my Dick.

2481
01:45:59,330 --> 01:46:00,920
Belongs in your mouth.
Look at that,

2482
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,440
Christie Brinkley.
Bam,

2483
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,440
Bam.
Now look at how,

2484
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,730
but that's a a really good picture.
That's a really good picture of Hillary

2485
01:46:10,731 --> 01:46:11,564
too,
by the way.

2486
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:13,450
There's some horrific pictures of
Hillary.

2487
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:16,100
Yeah,
you can find some monstrous ones.

2488
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:20,120
That's probably from about 30 40 years
ago to how long ago was that picture?

2489
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:25,520
It's November 21st two months old lies.
That's photoshop.

2490
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:26,870
The same people that,
uh,

2491
01:46:26,910 --> 01:46:29,310
the girls are on Instagram,
they use that.

2492
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:32,660
She's listed as 68 and Christie
Brinkley's 61 so seven years,

2493
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:33,890
seven years,
whatever.

2494
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:36,770
There's no way the Christie brick is
going to look that bad in seven years,

2495
01:46:38,610 --> 01:46:42,200
but go for a better picture because it
can happen for her.

2496
01:46:42,230 --> 01:46:43,520
Look at that.
Look at her face right there.

2497
01:46:44,350 --> 01:46:46,250
Get the fuck Outta here,
dude.

2498
01:46:46,430 --> 01:46:49,650
She's hot,
but she's also genetically gifted.

2499
01:46:49,830 --> 01:46:51,450
You know that's a,
that's a,

2500
01:46:51,451 --> 01:46:56,451
that's her gift to look like that Eo.
Meaning there's a lot involved.

2501
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,620
It's not just genetics involved.
She certainly was genetically gifted at

2502
01:47:01,621 --> 01:47:05,280
the jump to have that bone structure.
Yeah,

2503
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,650
but there's a lot involved there.
First of all,

2504
01:47:07,651 --> 01:47:10,470
there's massive exercise diet.
Yeah,

2505
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:14,010
for sure.
Gotta be some Botox and some cautious

2506
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:15,930
use of fillers.
Kegels.

2507
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:17,250
Yeah.
Look at that one right there.

2508
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:18,533
Like,
come on man.

2509
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:20,350
That's a hot 35 year old,
right?

2510
01:47:20,570 --> 01:47:22,110
That,
how is that possible?

2511
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:24,510
How is that?
That doesn't make any sense.

2512
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:27,330
Why aren't her teeth rotting out of her
fucking head or those,

2513
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:31,590
they can't be real teeth.
Those teeth are made out of ivory.

2514
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:33,060
From murdered elephants.

2515
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:37,410
Yeah.
Had real teeth.

2516
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,260
And you know what?
Fucking up my grandmother died when she

2517
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:43,500
was like 64 and her teeth looked like
shit.

2518
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:45,990
Why is she so hot?
I appreciate the effort too.

2519
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:49,740
By the way.
Her forehead would not move if you had a

2520
01:47:49,740 --> 01:47:52,560
hundred Mexicans and six trucks trying
to move it.

2521
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,050
Yeah.
It's all the moving trucks in the world.

2522
01:47:56,051 --> 01:47:57,840
They're not going to make that fucking
forehead move.

2523
01:47:57,841 --> 01:48:00,780
That thing is frozen in time.
Like a,

2524
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:03,390
like a bully.
Mammoth trapped underneath a glacier.

2525
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:08,970
Nothing's moving.
Look at it fucking for you.

2526
01:48:08,971 --> 01:48:10,080
I did.
She didn't moving.

2527
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:12,990
She barely has some lines in the corner
of her eyes.

2528
01:48:12,991 --> 01:48:14,910
That's it.
She's hot as fuck though.

2529
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,650
Yeah,
whatever she's doing,

2530
01:48:16,890 --> 01:48:19,410
everyone should do it.
We should all do it and by the way,

2531
01:48:19,590 --> 01:48:22,650
this is what we're seeing from this rare
of rare,

2532
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:26,760
about 1% of the one,
but then of the one I sent this is,

2533
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:30,840
she is the rarest of the rare when it
comes to like women in their sixties

2534
01:48:30,841 --> 01:48:32,040
that are still hot as fuck.

2535
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:34,620
She's 100% hot as fuck.
Right?

2536
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:37,710
That is what women are going to look
like in the future.

2537
01:48:37,740 --> 01:48:39,090
There's this doctor,
doctor,

2538
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:42,390
I think he's an impure welling.
They get same guy who created regena

2539
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:46,860
keen that blends pending procedure.
They are literally months away from

2540
01:48:46,861 --> 01:48:51,780
launching some new treatment where
reignites your body's ability to produce

2541
01:48:51,781 --> 01:48:54,990
Collagen.
And so college in his weight makes your

2542
01:48:54,991 --> 01:48:58,560
face turn all hillary like hang and
droop and then it loses all its

2543
01:48:58,561 --> 01:49:01,830
elasticity.
They gonna bring that shit right back to

2544
01:49:01,831 --> 01:49:06,090
life and your face pops out no more.
When women get those old,

2545
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:10,200
old lady elbows were,
the skin's just hanging.

2546
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,600
Nobody wants to see that.
So what will they do?

2547
01:49:12,630 --> 01:49:13,770
They'll just,
I don't know.

2548
01:49:13,771 --> 01:49:15,880
I don't understand the procedure,
but it'll tighten up on you.

2549
01:49:16,150 --> 01:49:20,200
You are going to,
your body's Collagen production is going

2550
01:49:20,201 --> 01:49:23,670
to read kickstart.
It's going to just jam back into your

2551
01:49:23,671 --> 01:49:26,670
skin and your cells are going to
flourish and they're just going to

2552
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:31,290
fucking look elastic and yeah,
you gotta Oh,

2553
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,190
wonderful.

2554
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:33,030
Again,
I like it.

2555
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:36,270
I like us all walking around.
I'll tight faced.

2556
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:37,253
Yeah.
Hot.

2557
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:38,700
Crazy.
Yeah.

2558
01:49:38,770 --> 01:49:40,050
You Imagine?
Yeah.

2559
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:41,160
Yeah.
Oh,

2560
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:45,240
ladies are going to snap back to life.
Start strength training again.

2561
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:46,710
Build their butt up.
Woo.

2562
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:48,700
And they'll looking for,
still have old lady feeding.

2563
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,080
Uh,
yeah.

2564
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:52,750
Keep socks on heath,
a socks,

2565
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:56,410
big thick socks.
I don't even see the twisted shape

2566
01:49:56,411 --> 01:49:58,870
underneath.
He'll crust at,

2567
01:49:58,871 --> 01:50:00,700
won't go away.
Ooh,

2568
01:50:00,850 --> 01:50:02,800
he'll crust.
Don't they have treatments for that

2569
01:50:02,801 --> 01:50:04,750
though?
There's sand it down,

2570
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:05,390
right?
Yeah,

2571
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:09,030
there's commercials for it and Mama
Stone's always trying to things that'll

2572
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:11,230
just shave it off.
But I dunno.

2573
01:50:11,290 --> 01:50:13,510
Have you ever seen that show dual
survivor?

2574
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:14,800
Yes.
Wait,

2575
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:19,210
is that the one where it's a couple of
ex military guys and they,

2576
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:21,390
they're wandering around.
Yeah.

2577
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:23,740
And only survive,
drop them off in a lake or something.

2578
01:50:23,741 --> 01:50:27,490
It's like sort of a fake version of
survivor man with two dudes.

2579
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,800
Yes.
But one of the guys who's a survival

2580
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:32,170
expert,
and I use air quotes for that,

2581
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:34,360
I'm sure he's an expert,
but he's,

2582
01:50:34,361 --> 01:50:36,310
he's,
I think his name is cody and he's

2583
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:39,400
completely crazy.
He doesn't wear shoes ever,

2584
01:50:40,060 --> 01:50:42,580
ever.
So he goes through the jungle,

2585
01:50:42,750 --> 01:50:45,880
one or two,
the jungle barefoot and his feet are a

2586
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:50,881
fucking atrocity to be,
there have to be a crime against nature.

2587
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:53,890
His feet,
he's doesn't wear shoes ever,

2588
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:56,530
ever.
So he's just developed these insanely

2589
01:50:56,531 --> 01:51:00,640
thick calluses on his feet,
like his photos of his feet online.

2590
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:03,520
What does that,
well,

2591
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:06,280
that's a good photo.
There's feet look great there,

2592
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:11,290
but you've got to see like what his feet
look like when they get close up on like

2593
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:15,370
the bottoms of them.
I've seen some horrific photos of what

2594
01:51:15,371 --> 01:51:20,371
his feet looked like,
but he just walks everywhere through the

2595
01:51:20,621 --> 01:51:21,850
jungle.
Like there's this huge,

2596
01:51:21,851 --> 01:51:24,880
oh my fucking God.
Look how thick it is.

2597
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:27,300
Cracked and everything.
Jesus Christ,

2598
01:51:27,310 --> 01:51:29,110
what's called dual survivor.
Yeah.

2599
01:51:29,260 --> 01:51:32,920
There's the bottoms of his feet.
Look at that a lot to

2600
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,700
make my eyes water and he got elephant
skin fee.

2601
01:51:40,640 --> 01:51:41,760
God.
Yeah,

2602
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:46,800
well that's what people did for sure.
It is weird that we have clothes and

2603
01:51:47,051 --> 01:51:47,950
shoes.
Yes.

2604
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:50,560
I mean for years,
I mean obviously many,

2605
01:51:50,561 --> 01:51:53,020
many years,
everybody walked and ran everywhere

2606
01:51:53,021 --> 01:51:54,240
barefoot,
so yeah.

2607
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:56,530
Well that's why it's strange to see
someone naked.

2608
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:58,960
What are you doing?
How many clothes on?

2609
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:01,480
Ooh,

2610
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:06,520
who's the first person to wear clothes?
Who's the first person to come out of

2611
01:52:06,521 --> 01:52:08,970
the cave and you're like,
what the fuck are you doing this kind

2612
01:52:09,020 --> 01:52:11,510
get,
I got underwear on and it's a guide.

2613
01:52:11,511 --> 01:52:14,280
A Little Dick.
I had to be,

2614
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:16,930
he saw a couple of other things was
like,

2615
01:52:16,931 --> 01:52:21,540
what the fuck is that little Dick
started surviving people like that's a

2616
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:23,110
like a trait,
right?

2617
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:24,640
Right.
Somebody with a little deck.

2618
01:52:24,641 --> 01:52:28,220
How to fuck somebody like,
but that had to be like,

2619
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:32,890
I mean is it a trait because it's,
everybody's a big Dick has a big dick

2620
01:52:32,891 --> 01:52:33,724
son.
I don't know.

2621
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:37,900
You imagine if you have a giant Dick and
your kid has a little tiny micro deck.

2622
01:52:37,901 --> 01:52:38,770
Man.
I know.

2623
01:52:39,430 --> 01:52:41,740
Fuck you're not my son.
Yeah,

2624
01:52:41,741 --> 01:52:43,990
you probably start thinking fucking
whore.

2625
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:46,970
She's banging some little Dick Guy.
She got tired of my big Dick.

2626
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:48,560
I sons,
three weeks old.

2627
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:50,560
Giant hug.
We have no idea about the same size dick

2628
01:52:50,561 --> 01:52:55,561
though.
His body proportion wise about lines up.

2629
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:59,170
You imagine if your son was born with
just said giant hard.

2630
01:52:59,180 --> 01:53:01,520
Yeah,
he comes out and he's,

2631
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:03,680
why is he up to and bill?
Oh God,

2632
01:53:03,681 --> 01:53:05,670
that's hard.
To his

2633
01:53:07,380 --> 01:53:08,280
time.
He's a baby.

2634
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:13,281
It's hard every day the balls look big.
How big their body such so small,

2635
01:53:14,751 --> 01:53:19,751
the babies and then you just see like a
ball bag that stands out for half side

2636
01:53:20,291 --> 01:53:22,910
the size of the baby.
Do you know that the size of the

2637
01:53:22,911 --> 01:53:27,860
testicles is directly proportionate to
the amount of promiscuous women who are

2638
01:53:27,861 --> 01:53:29,390
in the area?
Well,

2639
01:53:29,391 --> 01:53:31,820
there's some fucking sluts where I live
cause he's,

2640
01:53:32,750 --> 01:53:36,230
he's got a big balls on them.
Well they actually say that the human

2641
01:53:36,231 --> 01:53:40,490
body adapts to the amount of promiscuous
women that are in the area and your

2642
01:53:40,491 --> 01:53:41,660
balls so crazy.

2643
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:45,560
It's how it is with primates.
The more promiscuous the women are in

2644
01:53:45,561 --> 01:53:48,770
the area of the larger the testicles are
of the primate.

2645
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:52,580
That's why chimps have giant balls.
But gorillas have little tiny balls,

2646
01:53:52,910 --> 01:53:55,910
little tiny balls and little tiny dicks
for chimps,

2647
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:57,260
for gorillas,
for gorillas.

2648
01:53:57,290 --> 01:53:58,550
Because chimp,
chimp,

2649
01:53:58,551 --> 01:54:01,220
women are hookers right there.
Just sluts.

2650
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:04,580
But gorilla women,
they mind their PS and qs if fucking

2651
01:54:04,581 --> 01:54:05,750
keep it in line,
right?

2652
01:54:06,220 --> 01:54:11,220
The gorilla has,
right gorilla has a Harem.

2653
01:54:11,660 --> 01:54:15,860
He's got a Harem big fucking pile of
bitches and it just sticks his little

2654
01:54:15,861 --> 01:54:20,540
tiny digging them
to champion the chimp.

2655
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:22,670
They just fuck everybody fucks
everybody.

2656
01:54:22,671 --> 01:54:24,150
And when you're not looking at me,
funny,

2657
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:28,250
the super slutty but knows they must
have some giant dicks.

2658
01:54:28,251 --> 01:54:29,150
Giant balls.
Yup.

2659
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:30,350
Yup.
They're balls.

2660
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:33,860
Chimp balls are giant and that's the
reason why they're giant.

2661
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:37,190
But they ha they have observed that in
humans,

2662
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:39,580
like,
like the dirt,

2663
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:44,620
there's a direct relation to the size of
the testicles because the more sluts

2664
01:54:45,321 --> 01:54:48,110
they're on the area,
the more competition there is to get

2665
01:54:48,111 --> 01:54:51,020
your sperm and so you have to produce
more sperm.

2666
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,630
So you have to have larger balls.
Yeah.

2667
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:55,710
How about that?
That's something man,

2668
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:58,370
I didn't know that.
Nuts and primates,

2669
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,130
there's a direct connection.
They used to think that there was

2670
01:55:01,131 --> 01:55:04,760
different kinds of sperm.
There was a book written called sperm

2671
01:55:04,761 --> 01:55:07,430
wars,
but it's been largely disproven.

2672
01:55:07,431 --> 01:55:10,160
And the idea behind that book was that
there's different kinds of sperm.

2673
01:55:10,161 --> 01:55:13,160
This actual sperm that attack other
sperm,

2674
01:55:13,220 --> 01:55:15,320
they go in there and the attack others
perm,

2675
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,550
that turns out to not be true.
There's no evidence that sperm have any

2676
01:55:19,551 --> 01:55:23,030
other duty other than coming,
you know,

2677
01:55:23,570 --> 01:55:25,820
hitting eggs and trying to get people
pregnant.

2678
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:28,760
They don't have any other properties.
They don't actually kill.

2679
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:30,710
Sounds like a good premise for a movie
though.

2680
01:55:30,810 --> 01:55:33,260
It sounds like an awesome promise.
Killer Jews.

2681
01:55:33,261 --> 01:55:34,610
Yeah,
she went blind.

2682
01:55:34,611 --> 01:55:36,840
She got the killer as in her eyes.
No sperm.

2683
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:37,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2684
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:38,300
Like it.

2685
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:41,330
Yeah.
If you like around a lot of promiscuous

2686
01:55:41,331 --> 01:55:42,830
women,
like on a porn set,

2687
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:46,710
then that ges that gets in a girl's eyes
could probably blind her cause it's just

2688
01:55:46,711 --> 01:55:50,940
looking at kill other sperm
burrow into your eye.

2689
01:55:52,350 --> 01:55:56,890
Like little fucking piranhas.
It's chewing away through this or if

2690
01:55:56,970 --> 01:55:58,430
outer a on one of those,
those,

2691
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:03,480
those mugs that it starts bubbling cause
there's main ones in there like fucking

2692
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:09,010
feeding frenzy in the Mug.
If you bet a bunch of guys is in

2693
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:16,400
gang fight in the calm,
like I don't want to drink it,

2694
01:56:16,401 --> 01:56:19,470
drink it.
It's frothing like boiling water.

2695
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:28,200
Have you ever gone fishing?
Um,

2696
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:31,310
where there's a feeding frenzy?
Uh,

2697
01:56:31,340 --> 01:56:35,640
yes I have actually.
I was in Mexico and it was awesome man,

2698
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:37,330
because a,
I took my kids fit,

2699
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:39,090
my kids love fishing.
It's really fun.

2700
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:40,620
Yeah,
they love it because it's,

2701
01:56:40,621 --> 01:56:43,470
it's fun for little kids.
Like if you can get them like near where

2702
01:56:43,471 --> 01:56:45,370
the fish are and they actually catch
one,

2703
01:56:45,371 --> 01:56:48,330
so exciting and then they get to eat it.
They are so happy.

2704
01:56:48,331 --> 01:56:51,810
Like we caught this,
I'm eating it and we caught it mommy.

2705
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:54,260
Like they're so excited.
But we um,

2706
01:56:54,450 --> 01:56:59,100
we went out in Mexico and there was like
a hundred yards,

2707
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:02,630
like a football field size of all these
uh,

2708
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:06,690
Jack's like Amber Jacks,
I guess there are skipjacks and they

2709
01:57:06,691 --> 01:57:10,320
were crushing these bait fish.
So they are like anchovies or something

2710
01:57:10,321 --> 01:57:12,420
like that or minnows,
whatever the fuck it is.

2711
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:17,550
And they're smashing these things and
the whole like football field size is

2712
01:57:17,551 --> 01:57:22,530
just frothing and all you had to do is
get close to it and cast a lure in

2713
01:57:22,531 --> 01:57:23,364
there.

2714
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:24,660
Bam.
And the girls are like,

2715
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:29,340
they're holding onto the rod and I have
to hold on to that with them.

2716
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,170
Otherwise,
like the fish will literally pull the

2717
01:57:31,171 --> 01:57:33,150
rod in the water.
It was wild,

2718
01:57:33,151 --> 01:57:34,410
man.
It's wild.

2719
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,850
Yeah.
Fishing is a pretty good time.

2720
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,400
I haven't done it in a wild fucking,
I love it.

2721
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:39,510
It's fun.
So Fun,

2722
01:57:39,511 --> 01:57:41,730
man.
I just love the idea that you could go

2723
01:57:41,731 --> 01:57:45,960
out into that water and catch lunch.
You just go out of here and bring home

2724
01:57:45,961 --> 01:57:46,794
dinner.
Yeah.

2725
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:48,390
That's again,
not a store.

2726
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:52,110
And if you ever had fish that's caught
like they prepared it for us.

2727
01:57:52,111 --> 01:57:53,700
We caught a couple different kinds of
fish.

2728
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:55,230
We caught a,
um,

2729
01:57:55,530 --> 01:57:56,730
when I was in Hawaii,
we call it an,

2730
01:57:56,750 --> 01:57:57,930
oh no,
I'm going to call it,

2731
01:57:57,931 --> 01:58:01,920
or it's a Wahoo,
but they call them Ono's and I'm an ono

2732
01:58:01,921 --> 01:58:03,540
is dalicious.

2733
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:07,020
It's such a delicious fish and the sh,
it's a big fish too.

2734
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:09,750
So we couldn't have even eaten all of
it.

2735
01:58:09,751 --> 01:58:14,610
So I gave half of it to the guy who ran
the boat and then we took half of it.

2736
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:17,940
Half of the fish was enough for my whole
family.

2737
01:58:18,330 --> 01:58:22,260
Everybody ate it and they ate it.
They prepared a bunch of different ways.

2738
01:58:22,261 --> 01:58:25,170
They made Sushimi out of it.
They made like a,

2739
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:28,170
they baked it and they grilled it.
So they gave us like three different

2740
01:58:28,171 --> 01:58:30,600
preparations and the Oh,
they even made some Vj.

2741
01:58:30,640 --> 01:58:31,530
Yeah,
they made CV chairs.

2742
01:58:31,531 --> 01:58:33,750
What city were you in doing?
This was in,

2743
01:58:33,770 --> 01:58:35,040
uh,
that was in Maui.

2744
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:36,203
Wow.
Yeah,

2745
01:58:36,990 --> 01:58:38,340
it was a really awesome man.
That's,

2746
01:58:38,341 --> 01:58:40,530
no actually that was on the big island,
but um,

2747
01:58:41,290 --> 01:58:43,480
I love Hawaiian man.
I wish it wasn't so far.

2748
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:46,060
I know,
but that's why it's awesome.

2749
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:47,720
It's cause it's so far.
Yeah.

2750
01:58:47,760 --> 01:58:49,330
If it was right there it'd be like
Mexico.

2751
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:51,400
You just go right there.
But Mexico is pretty bad ass too,

2752
01:58:51,401 --> 01:58:53,050
man.
You go there recently,

2753
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:53,921
Mexico.
Yeah,

2754
01:58:53,921 --> 01:58:55,300
I was there last year.
Uh,

2755
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:57,370
area.
Um,

2756
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:00,430
Punto Tomita okay.
It's called,

2757
01:59:00,830 --> 01:59:02,350
is that important by artos or what it
is?

2758
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:03,580
I Dunno.
I've been,

2759
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:06,880
I went to the loom.
Taloon was nice.

2760
01:59:06,881 --> 01:59:07,550
That was cool.
Um,

2761
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:10,030
the next time I go,
I want to go where the Aztec Pyramids

2762
01:59:10,031 --> 01:59:12,700
are.
Cause when I was in Mexico City,

2763
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:17,400
I've been in Mexico City twice last year
for the UFC and a,

2764
01:59:17,420 --> 01:59:18,340
but I want to go,
man,

2765
01:59:18,341 --> 01:59:20,830
I just fucking chill in my hotel and
work out.

2766
01:59:20,860 --> 01:59:22,060
It's pretty crazy city,
right?

2767
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:22,960
It's nuts.
Yeah.

2768
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:24,460
It's chaos.
First of all,

2769
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:27,130
the pollution is worse than anything
you've ever seen in your life.

2770
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:28,360
Really?
Oh my God.

2771
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:31,450
I took photos and put it on my instagram
and people thought it was bullshit.

2772
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:33,100
Really?
It's insane.

2773
01:59:33,101 --> 01:59:34,960
Like the photos on instagram that I put
up,

2774
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:38,290
it looks like you're in a fire like it
looks like,

2775
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:39,220
is that bad?
Oh,

2776
01:59:39,221 --> 01:59:41,260
it's crazy.
It's way worse than La.

2777
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:45,520
It's like Yelei in 20 years if if Donald
Trump becomes president.

2778
01:59:45,521 --> 01:59:46,354
Yeah,
yeah,

2779
01:59:46,810 --> 01:59:48,550
yeah.
It's the biggest city in the world,

2780
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:50,020
is it?
Yeah,

2781
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:51,460
I believe so.
More than it.

2782
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:54,520
Chinese cities like Beijing,
there's harm people,

2783
01:59:54,700 --> 01:59:55,241
so,
right,

2784
01:59:55,241 --> 01:59:56,074
right,
right.

2785
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:57,933
I tell him,
no,

2786
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:00,460
I,
I'm pretty sure it's the biggest,

2787
02:00:00,461 --> 02:00:02,650
it might be just the biggest in North
America and you might be right.

2788
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:05,230
Yeah.
They might have Chinese cities with 100

2789
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:07,300
billion.
The biggest last time we looked this up,

2790
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:10,540
Tokyo two,
three 30 million sentence.

2791
02:00:10,541 --> 02:00:12,290
It's a lot.
I saw it.

2792
02:00:12,430 --> 02:00:14,410
La Isn't la.
You have 20 million.

2793
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:15,810
It's not official.
Well,

2794
02:00:15,811 --> 02:00:17,070
let's,
let's Google the world's.

2795
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:17,591
Let's,
let's,

2796
02:00:17,591 --> 02:00:19,180
let's guess right now,
I'll tell you this.

2797
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:22,210
My guests,
I have a guest on site called La County

2798
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:24,910
and that city county,
it's probably 13,

2799
02:00:24,911 --> 02:00:27,940
14 million posts.
You're not counting Mexicans.

2800
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,920
Uh,
am I not?

2801
02:00:29,921 --> 02:00:32,080
How many illegal aliens are there in
California?

2802
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:35,010
Uh,
no one has a fucking club.

2803
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:36,970
1 million.
Isn't that hilarious?

2804
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,200
Yeah.
It might be true.

2805
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:40,720
7 million illegals.
Yeah.

2806
02:00:41,230 --> 02:00:43,390
13 million regular.
Yeah.

2807
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:45,160
Normal people.
Normal people.

2808
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:50,670
What does that 3.8 for la La city
properties,

2809
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:54,220
if that's exactly what that horse shit.
That's Los Filez.

2810
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:55,550
Yeah,
he's right.

2811
02:00:57,550 --> 02:00:59,680
Wow.
But that's not counting.

2812
02:00:59,681 --> 02:01:00,071
That's,
you know,

2813
02:01:00,071 --> 02:01:01,930
that's not the greater metropolitan.
Yeah.

2814
02:01:01,931 --> 02:01:04,570
That's the thing is that La is not
really a city.

2815
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:06,910
It's,
you know,

2816
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:09,070
it seems like,
whoa.

2817
02:01:09,071 --> 02:01:11,860
What is 18 million greater Los Angeles
area?

2818
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:15,210
18 million.
18 five mm.

2819
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,680
Yeah.
That seems that's more,

2820
02:01:17,230 --> 02:01:19,330
see the greater,
the thing about when I say la is not a

2821
02:01:19,331 --> 02:01:21,550
city,
what I mean is like New York City's a

2822
02:01:21,551 --> 02:01:23,260
city.
It's only New York City.

2823
02:01:23,261 --> 02:01:25,830
Like you go there and you're like,
oh he wouldn't allow it in the city.

2824
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:30,040
People say,
oh we left the city greater Tokyo is 35

2825
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:31,360
million.
Oh my God.

2826
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:36,520
27% of the nation's entire population.
Ooh,

2827
02:01:37,270 --> 02:01:39,980
wow.
Now how about China's

2828
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:42,440
cities?
Cause I saw something that said they

2829
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:47,441
have something like 10 or maybe more
than 10 cities in China with 20 million

2830
02:01:48,201 --> 02:01:49,880
or more people.
Oh my God.

2831
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:52,310
Okay.

2832
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:57,310
Jesus Christ.
China's cities.

2833
02:01:59,930 --> 02:02:02,180
There you go.
List of cities.

2834
02:02:03,700 --> 02:02:04,930
Wow.
Look at that.

2835
02:02:05,680 --> 02:02:07,570
Wait a minute.
Look at that first city,

2836
02:02:07,860 --> 02:02:09,430
but don't even know what fucking city
that is.

2837
02:02:09,690 --> 02:02:10,523
Area.
Hold on.

2838
02:02:10,740 --> 02:02:14,470
Population control.
I was 12 million.

2839
02:02:14,471 --> 02:02:19,471
700,000 okay,
so Shanghai 23 Jesus,

2840
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:26,250
23 for Shanghai.
What does Beijing administrative area,

2841
02:02:26,700 --> 02:02:30,620
you say that's not the real,
but see the problem with this is you

2842
02:02:30,621 --> 02:02:32,980
leaving this up to people in China to
counter people.

2843
02:02:33,010 --> 02:02:33,990
Yeah.
Okay.

2844
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,300
This city that you'd never heard of that
has 28 million tongue Pong Chong.

2845
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:41,380
What does that [inaudible] I think it's
admirable.

2846
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:43,080
A Tab.
Isn't that funny that if you,

2847
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:44,680
if you do that,
you're an asshole.

2848
02:02:44,740 --> 02:02:45,573
Yeah,
of course.

2849
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:49,360
You know,
if you a few incorrectly pronounce Asian

2850
02:02:49,361 --> 02:02:51,430
cities in a humorous way,
yeah.

2851
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:55,690
You're a terrible person.
Of course you can't say Chung Chong

2852
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:56,680
Chong.
You can't say that,

2853
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,350
but I'm a bad person.
Right.

2854
02:03:00,970 --> 02:03:04,210
Bad person and that funny.
Guang jewel,

2855
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:08,620
the Wang jewel population 2015 what do
we got here?

2856
02:03:08,740 --> 02:03:10,060
14 million.
Hmm.

2857
02:03:10,090 --> 02:03:11,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

2858
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:13,780
According to who?
Guangzhou jeans.

2859
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:16,630
They're not counting.
They're not counting for real.

2860
02:03:16,690 --> 02:03:18,640
They're hiding their babies to for real.
For Real.

2861
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:24,540
And you're only allowed to hit women 30
million additional in migrants living in

2862
02:03:24,641 --> 02:03:26,590
the area for six months out of the year.

2863
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:27,883
What?
What?

2864
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:31,900
Oh my God.
So they have 13 million and 30 million,

2865
02:03:32,260 --> 02:03:33,640
30 million people just kind of sitting
around.

2866
02:03:34,330 --> 02:03:37,500
They don't really live here.
There are snowbirds or you live in

2867
02:03:37,501 --> 02:03:38,081
there.
You live in there.

2868
02:03:38,081 --> 02:03:39,940
You can't say migrants.
No,

2869
02:03:39,970 --> 02:03:41,620
you're fucking with your numbers,
man.

2870
02:03:41,621 --> 02:03:43,480
It's Hollywood logic.
Or Hollywood,

2871
02:03:43,481 --> 02:03:44,530
uh,
arithmetic.

2872
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:46,180
Yeah.
When they do Hollywood accounting,

2873
02:03:46,181 --> 02:03:49,750
I movies for sure have a movie that made
$100 million and they tell the actors,

2874
02:03:49,751 --> 02:03:51,370
I'm sorry.
No problem.

2875
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,750
Really make that kind of money.
Yeah.

2876
02:03:52,751 --> 02:03:57,070
We'd love to give you what you deserve,
but we can't because the accounting,

2877
02:03:57,910 --> 02:04:01,300
it says we didn't make any money.
Yeah.

2878
02:04:01,600 --> 02:04:03,820
Hmm.
I tell you to do with record companies

2879
02:04:03,821 --> 02:04:04,654
too,
right?

2880
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:08,230
Yep.
Have you seen soaked in bleach soaked in

2881
02:04:08,231 --> 02:04:09,090
bleach?
Yeah.

2882
02:04:09,670 --> 02:04:13,420
That's something that I have to watch.
So it's courtney.

2883
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:15,250
There's a documentary about courtney
love.

2884
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:18,340
Eddie Bravo in Brendan Schaub.
We're fucking raving about,

2885
02:04:18,350 --> 02:04:18,730
oh,
really?

2886
02:04:18,730 --> 02:04:23,730
Saying that she killed Kurt cobain and
her former bodyguard private

2887
02:04:24,941 --> 02:04:26,500
investigator.
Apparently.

2888
02:04:26,980 --> 02:04:30,190
Uh,
he's the one who recorded all these

2889
02:04:30,191 --> 02:04:33,580
conversations with her.
And it's another Netflix jammy.

2890
02:04:33,730 --> 02:04:34,563
No,
no.

2891
02:04:34,570 --> 02:04:36,550
It's a documentary,
but it's on Netflix,

2892
02:04:36,551 --> 02:04:37,384
right?
Yeah.

2893
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:39,360
Okay.
You were talking about narcos.

2894
02:04:39,361 --> 02:04:40,310
You just started that.
Yeah.

2895
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:44,010
Smart goals really goes to shit.
So good.

2896
02:04:44,070 --> 02:04:46,170
It's fucking,
Netflix is killing it lately.

2897
02:04:46,290 --> 02:04:48,390
F is for family.
The bill burr series.

2898
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:50,040
Hilarious.
Uh,

2899
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:51,540
blood line.
The new,

2900
02:04:51,541 --> 02:04:54,430
I'm Bob and Dave show,
Mr Show.

2901
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:56,910
They're doing it.
They're calling.

2902
02:04:56,940 --> 02:04:58,350
I don't know what they're calling bob
and Dave.

2903
02:04:58,351 --> 02:04:59,730
That's what it's called with Bob and
David.

2904
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:00,750
It's funny,
man.

2905
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:03,780
It's really good.
I saw the Aziz Ansari show.

2906
02:05:05,320 --> 02:05:06,121
Yeah,
it's okay.

2907
02:05:06,121 --> 02:05:08,610
It's been rave reviews cause he's in
sorry shows.

2908
02:05:08,611 --> 02:05:09,270
Yeah,
for sure.

2909
02:05:09,270 --> 02:05:10,650
Yeah.
I haven't seen it.

2910
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:13,260
Bloodlines.
How bad do you want the whole thing?

2911
02:05:13,470 --> 02:05:14,490
I watched the first episode.

2912
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:15,653
It's like,
it's okay.

2913
02:05:15,740 --> 02:05:16,471
It's,
I mean,

2914
02:05:16,471 --> 02:05:18,510
I had a couple of laughs,
you know who was funny in it?

2915
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:19,740
Eric,
we're Haim.

2916
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:20,993
Tim and Eric.
Yeah,

2917
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,730
he's fucking hilarious.
Yeah,

2918
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:24,900
that guy's a maniac.
He's really funny.

2919
02:05:24,930 --> 02:05:26,310
He's funny.
He's funny in that.

2920
02:05:26,690 --> 02:05:27,300
Um,
but,

2921
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:30,450
but bob and David,
maybe the problem is I compared it to

2922
02:05:30,451 --> 02:05:32,670
Bob and David.
Maybe if I watched it on its own,

2923
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:35,940
I would like it more.
But Bob and David was fucking funny.

2924
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:39,390
Like really good.
I just got into the killing and,

2925
02:05:39,450 --> 02:05:43,170
and ran through that,
which was an AMC show that ended up on

2926
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:45,690
Netflix.
Then Netflix paid for a fourth season.

2927
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,100
Really?
That series.

2928
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:49,050
I loved it.
I love the killing.

2929
02:05:49,051 --> 02:05:53,010
What is it about?
It's about these two Seattle homicide

2930
02:05:53,011 --> 02:05:54,690
detectives,
but it's really good,

2931
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:56,680
you know,
storytelling that the,

2932
02:05:57,060 --> 02:06:02,060
basically it's them following a murder
per season and they really,

2933
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:04,740
you know,
it makes it super engaging.

2934
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:07,950
It's cliff hanger stuff where it ends.
You're like fucking press play on the

2935
02:06:07,951 --> 02:06:09,360
next one.
Isn't that crazy too?

2936
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:11,760
They were lease.
That's one of the things where netflix

2937
02:06:11,761 --> 02:06:13,250
figured it out.
Yeah.

2938
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:17,220
They just released the entire season and
won gold course binge watch it.

2939
02:06:17,850 --> 02:06:19,350
Yeah.
It's the cards.

2940
02:06:19,710 --> 02:06:21,400
Everything.
They had house of cards.

2941
02:06:21,401 --> 02:06:24,180
I watch house of cards too.
I've watched one and a half episodes.

2942
02:06:24,181 --> 02:06:26,070
It's all I've seen,
but I saw it on a plane.

2943
02:06:26,071 --> 02:06:28,200
American Airlines has netflix on.
Oh fuck.

2944
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:30,660
Well that one.
I'll tell you.

2945
02:06:30,810 --> 02:06:34,620
I think you get three episodes in a
house of cards.

2946
02:06:34,890 --> 02:06:37,230
Consider it out.
You're done.

2947
02:06:37,260 --> 02:06:39,330
You're gonna Watch the whole fucking
thing if you make it that.

2948
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:40,770
Yeah,
it gets better.

2949
02:06:40,771 --> 02:06:41,950
Pilots are tough I think.
Yeah.

2950
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:45,840
As the more you watch shows like that,
you understand that pilots are tough to

2951
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:49,290
introduce a world introduced,
characters make you care about what's

2952
02:06:49,291 --> 02:06:49,940
going on.

2953
02:06:49,940 --> 02:06:54,390
But once if you can get over that hurdle
and you get to the second or third and

2954
02:06:54,391 --> 02:06:55,710
when it's good,
like I said,

2955
02:06:55,780 --> 02:07:00,780
bloodline I was totally impressed with
after I got to through a couple episodes

2956
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:03,270
and Fargo,
which is not a netflix thing,

2957
02:07:03,271 --> 02:07:06,410
but both of those seasons,
you know the,

2958
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:11,630
the first season pilot of Fargo is just
one of the best pilots I've ever seen.

2959
02:07:14,130 --> 02:07:15,350
Fargo,
I never hear about it.

2960
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:17,650
So fucking good.
Willie.

2961
02:07:17,690 --> 02:07:19,380
I think it might be the best show on
television.

2962
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:20,580
Dammit.
Tommy.

2963
02:07:20,580 --> 02:07:22,530
Yes.
And I sang this.

2964
02:07:22,710 --> 02:07:24,410
You got to check it out.
Wow.

2965
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:25,470
I'll give you,
uh,

2966
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:28,050
you're going to get me,
it was how I have it on DVD,

2967
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:32,460
but you can also just digitally give me
some shit and then you can also just,

2968
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:34,830
you know,
on demand it's on Fx.

2969
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:36,820
Really didn't give me,
give you,

2970
02:07:38,250 --> 02:07:39,083
give it to you.

2971
02:07:39,370 --> 02:07:40,720
It's an honor.
It's on Netflix.

2972
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:43,660
It's on.
But if you have apple TV,

2973
02:07:43,970 --> 02:07:45,970
oh,
he's going to Fx fx on demand.

2974
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:48,790
Oh,
watch it on apple TV is another thing

2975
02:07:48,791 --> 02:07:51,030
that is the shit.
Netflix is built dealers,

2976
02:07:51,070 --> 02:07:54,580
man and Netflix built in and it's great.
And the new one apparently is even

2977
02:07:54,581 --> 02:07:55,990
better.
I got the last generation.

2978
02:07:56,020 --> 02:07:58,610
I don't have to,
it's a new generation out of what?

2979
02:07:58,611 --> 02:08:00,670
Of the APPLETV.
I got the old shit.

2980
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:03,670
I don't even have the new shit.
There's new shit.

2981
02:08:03,910 --> 02:08:06,640
There's a new one real shit to use.
It's fast.

2982
02:08:06,641 --> 02:08:09,250
The remote's better.
Ooh,

2983
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:12,580
I might have to get a second hole.
Isn't there a way you can make a remote

2984
02:08:12,581 --> 02:08:14,470
with your phone?
You turn your phone into her amount.

2985
02:08:14,740 --> 02:08:17,950
That's some shit.
That's Jamie Shit.

2986
02:08:18,340 --> 02:08:20,450
Well they've been doing that with
android phones for a while.

2987
02:08:20,451 --> 02:08:23,710
So many android phones actually have
like an iar thing and the front making

2988
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:26,200
like pointed at your tv and you can
actually change channels.

2989
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:28,310
The Apple Guy was trying to get me while
I was in the store.

2990
02:08:28,311 --> 02:08:28,841
Like he's like,
Oh,

2991
02:08:28,841 --> 02:08:29,530
get these,
uh,

2992
02:08:29,530 --> 02:08:34,390
by these lights and then your phone can
control lights,

2993
02:08:34,420 --> 02:08:37,530
make them different colors.
We have those for here.

2994
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:39,310
Never installed them.
Okay.

2995
02:08:39,740 --> 02:08:41,530
Yeah.
Well I don't have that kind of time.

2996
02:08:41,531 --> 02:08:42,364
I go,
dude,

2997
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:45,400
come on man.
There's someone hacks my phone and turns

2998
02:08:45,401 --> 02:08:48,520
the fucking lights on,
off and on while I'm sleeping.

2999
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:50,860
It's no fun bullshit.
That's bullshit.

3000
02:08:50,890 --> 02:08:51,730
It's bullshit,
man.

3001
02:08:51,760 --> 02:08:54,850
It's a light switch.
My wife installed these stupid fucking

3002
02:08:54,851 --> 02:08:57,760
light panels in my house.
They're like a little computer or you

3003
02:08:57,761 --> 02:08:59,560
have to touch.
It's a touchscreen thing.

3004
02:08:59,561 --> 02:09:02,600
It's so stupid.
She likes it because it looks cool,

3005
02:09:02,710 --> 02:09:04,690
but they don't click.
There's not a click,

3006
02:09:04,691 --> 02:09:06,640
so when you walk in a room and the
lights off,

3007
02:09:06,670 --> 02:09:09,520
you can't just touch it.
You have to look at it.

3008
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:12,160
Find out where the,
the white light is.

3009
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:14,860
Touch that.
When it turns out it's glass.

3010
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:16,810
There's no tactile.
Feel.

3011
02:09:17,220 --> 02:09:19,000
Some horse shit.
Horse Shit.

3012
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:22,330
Do you,
how do you feel about curved tvs?

3013
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:25,450
Curved tvs are dog shit.
They can suck my dick.

3014
02:09:25,451 --> 02:09:26,410
How about that?
All right.

3015
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:28,870
I was looking for an opinion and I want
a flat tv.

3016
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:31,230
Goddammit.
I'm not looking at certain.

3017
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:33,640
The fucking cockpit of a jet.
Yeah.

3018
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:35,470
Why?
Why is it curved?

3019
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:37,270
I Dunno.
What am I have to look left?

3020
02:09:37,271 --> 02:09:38,740
Look right,
look forward.

3021
02:09:38,770 --> 02:09:41,950
I don't know where to look.
I it right in front of me and flat.

3022
02:09:42,070 --> 02:09:44,140
They know what not too big.
How about that?

3023
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:45,550
What size are you talking about?
Too?

3024
02:09:45,551 --> 02:09:47,580
Fucking big.
What size are you talking about?

3025
02:09:47,581 --> 02:09:49,240
Assholes.
They're hundred inch TV.

3026
02:09:49,241 --> 02:09:51,010
What the fuck are you looking?
What are you going up?

3027
02:09:51,011 --> 02:09:52,080
How far of you?

3028
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:54,580
How about you get a smaller TV and sit
closer?

3029
02:09:54,581 --> 02:09:58,420
You fuck what?
You got a 100 inch TV.

3030
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:01,240
We got to sit a mile away from that
fucking thing of taking the entire

3031
02:10:01,241 --> 02:10:04,180
image.
What about projectors?

3032
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:06,070
Those are dog shit.
I've had one.

3033
02:10:06,190 --> 02:10:08,200
They take it,
they take a couple seconds to boot up

3034
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:10,510
their stupid.
So someone steps in front of it.

3035
02:10:10,511 --> 02:10:12,820
You see that person on the screen.
So tvs,

3036
02:10:12,821 --> 02:10:16,150
the TVS are definitely the way to go.
The image is better too.

3037
02:10:16,270 --> 02:10:19,360
And I had a,
I've had several generations of,

3038
02:10:19,420 --> 02:10:20,470
of uh,
projectors.

3039
02:10:20,590 --> 02:10:23,050
Will you at my house?
Excuse me?

3040
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:25,570
When I had the projector room?
Yes.

3041
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:27,700
Yeah,
that's all gone now as a pool table in

3042
02:10:27,701 --> 02:10:28,810
there.
I gutted that room.

3043
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:29,321
Oh,
you did?

3044
02:10:29,321 --> 02:10:30,110
Yeah,
it changed it.

3045
02:10:30,110 --> 02:10:30,943
I didn't know.
But,

3046
02:10:30,970 --> 02:10:31,541
um,
when,

3047
02:10:31,541 --> 02:10:31,931
uh,
the,

3048
02:10:31,931 --> 02:10:33,470
the projector was there when I got
there,

3049
02:10:33,471 --> 02:10:33,980
when I moved

3050
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:34,671
in,
they,

3051
02:10:34,671 --> 02:10:36,950
uh,
it was one I had to buy it and it was

3052
02:10:36,951 --> 02:10:38,120
stupid.
I shouldn't have bought it.

3053
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:41,680
I should have told them,
take that wonky hunk of Shit and get out

3054
02:10:41,681 --> 02:10:42,514
of here.

3055
02:10:44,490 --> 02:10:47,220
I own your house.
Kicked the bricks.

3056
02:10:47,580 --> 02:10:47,990
Yeah.

3057
02:10:47,990 --> 02:10:49,210
Uh,
but the um,

3058
02:10:49,250 --> 02:10:50,360
the light,
if the,

3059
02:10:50,361 --> 02:10:53,090
the curtains were open even a little,
you couldn't watch TV.

3060
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:55,010
Yeah.
That's stuff you had to make it so dark.

3061
02:10:55,011 --> 02:10:57,220
You couldn't see anything.
She had to get blackout curtains.

3062
02:10:57,221 --> 02:10:59,270
You have blackout curtains,
you to shut the door.

3063
02:10:59,271 --> 02:11:01,190
If anybody opened the door while we're
watching TV,

3064
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:08,750
it was so stupid.
So then we got the next generation of,

3065
02:11:08,751 --> 02:11:09,710
um,
projector,

3066
02:11:09,711 --> 02:11:12,650
which is smaller.
It's a lower profile and it was much,

3067
02:11:12,651 --> 02:11:13,730
much,
much better.

3068
02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:17,330
And then I got a big TV in there and I
was like,

3069
02:11:17,570 --> 02:11:20,150
these things are stupid.
Projectors are stupid.

3070
02:11:20,151 --> 02:11:21,140
They're just not as good.

3071
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:23,470
It's not as good.
All right.

3072
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:25,400
I mean,
I was thinking about it,

3073
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:26,580
thinking about it.
Oh yeah,

3074
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:27,710
I love,
you know,

3075
02:11:27,770 --> 02:11:31,120
I love watching movies and all that.
So just get it a bad ass TV.

3076
02:11:31,121 --> 02:11:33,740
Do you want a nice tv?
They have four k TVS now.

3077
02:11:33,741 --> 02:11:37,540
Like this is a four K tv.
This fucking thing looks so good that

3078
02:11:37,580 --> 02:11:41,300
the resolution is so high end.
It's so pretty that when you're looking

3079
02:11:41,301 --> 02:11:43,040
at an image,
like it doesn't get any better than

3080
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:43,491
that.
You know,

3081
02:11:43,491 --> 02:11:45,950
my new specialist in four K oh my
goodness.

3082
02:11:45,951 --> 02:11:48,200
Your new special that's out this Friday
on Netflix.

3083
02:11:48,440 --> 02:11:50,150
January 8th.
What's it called?

3084
02:11:50,151 --> 02:11:51,830
It's called mostly stories.
Why'd you call it?

3085
02:11:51,831 --> 02:11:55,040
Mostly stories.
I just figured I tell stories and um,

3086
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,290
you know,
even though it's not the whole special

3087
02:11:57,291 --> 02:12:01,640
is not stories is the story about your
doctor in this one that's in my other

3088
02:12:01,641 --> 02:12:02,420
special,
oh,

3089
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:05,300
it's in my other special.
That one.

3090
02:12:05,360 --> 02:12:10,020
You know that I get a breakdown of what,
what does the best from a sound

3091
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:10,863
exchange,
they go,

3092
02:12:11,060 --> 02:12:14,600
here's what's what people are playing
the most on Pandora.

3093
02:12:14,630 --> 02:12:15,590
Really?
Yeah.

3094
02:12:15,620 --> 02:12:17,120
And that,
that story is number one.

3095
02:12:18,010 --> 02:12:20,420
It's a funny fucking store.
That's the doctor Dick Story.

3096
02:12:22,610 --> 02:12:25,610
This one,
a real guy to write a real guy who I

3097
02:12:25,611 --> 02:12:28,430
finally told him that I told a story
about him and I gave it to them to

3098
02:12:28,431 --> 02:12:30,170
listen to.
And then he called me.

3099
02:12:30,171 --> 02:12:31,400
He was like,
I fucking love it.

3100
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:35,690
He's like,
I just sent it to my parents and they

3101
02:12:35,691 --> 02:12:37,320
can't believe I talk like this to my
patient

3102
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:42,500
if anybody hasn't seen it.
And we don't want to give away any

3103
02:12:42,501 --> 02:12:45,560
spoilers because it's a fucking
specialist call.

3104
02:12:45,561 --> 02:12:47,600
Completely normal,
which is on that place.

3105
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:50,960
But the new one has ever a Serena
Williams bid in it.

3106
02:12:50,990 --> 02:12:51,711
Yes,
yes,

3107
02:12:51,711 --> 02:12:53,030
yes.
But this one has,

3108
02:12:53,031 --> 02:12:55,460
um,
has a bunch of stories of,

3109
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:57,110
you know,
it has a bunch of standup.

3110
02:12:57,170 --> 02:12:59,960
It's a standup special,
but I have stories about my trainer in

3111
02:12:59,961 --> 02:13:01,740
it.
I have a story about the Jesus trainer.

3112
02:13:01,741 --> 02:13:02,720
Yeah.
I have him a no,

3113
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:06,890
no.
And then I have a,

3114
02:13:07,670 --> 02:13:09,890
he's going to find out.
I think he's definitely gonna find out.

3115
02:13:09,891 --> 02:13:13,020
It's going to find out I have a Tyson
Mike Tyson stories in this role.

3116
02:13:13,510 --> 02:13:17,180
That's a great story too.
I have a story about a movie theater

3117
02:13:17,181 --> 02:13:20,450
fight that I got into and yeah,
there's all kinds of stories in it.

3118
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:22,860
I called it mostly stories.
Um,

3119
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:24,560
ask you,
um,

3120
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:26,030
oh,
this is all going to tell you

3121
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:28,690
no,
I d I downloaded one of your,

3122
02:13:28,691 --> 02:13:29,980
uh,
one of your,

3123
02:13:29,981 --> 02:13:32,280
uh,
cds off itunes.

3124
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:35,100
I bought one of your comedy cds.
Thanks and welcome.

3125
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:37,710
But there's something,
I was just in the mood for some comedy

3126
02:13:37,711 --> 02:13:39,360
and I know you're hilarious,
but I was,

3127
02:13:39,361 --> 02:13:41,010
um,
was really weird.

3128
02:13:41,820 --> 02:13:43,650
Uh,
my phone,

3129
02:13:44,040 --> 02:13:48,300
like when you have Bluetooth synced up
to your phone and your phone,

3130
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:50,880
um,
if it starts when I get in my car,

3131
02:13:50,881 --> 02:13:53,130
I don't know what the settings are,
why it does this,

3132
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,250
but my car,
we'll just all of a sudden start playing

3133
02:13:56,490 --> 02:13:59,490
like from the mold because it's set,
it's sinked up to Bluetooth and

3134
02:13:59,491 --> 02:14:02,670
Bluetooth for music.
So when I get in my car,

3135
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:05,010
it'll all of a sudden start playing
music.

3136
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:09,210
It plays your fucking Serena Williams
bit every time.

3137
02:14:09,240 --> 02:14:11,850
It's so bizarre.
Every time it plays it first.

3138
02:14:11,940 --> 02:14:14,460
So when I get in my car and I start my
car up,

3139
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:17,550
I hear you.
You're the first thing that I hear every

3140
02:14:17,551 --> 02:14:17,970
time.

3141
02:14:17,970 --> 02:14:19,530
That,
so as a whole about I,

3142
02:14:19,531 --> 02:14:21,240
you know,
I want to die in a dumb way.

3143
02:14:21,350 --> 02:14:23,460
Yeah.
Like it goes right into that.

3144
02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:27,570
Every time it's happened to me.
Well it happens to me in my car with a

3145
02:14:27,610 --> 02:14:29,580
gang starr,
which I guess is probably a better,

3146
02:14:29,581 --> 02:14:34,290
a better than my summary for you.
It's better if you got in your car and

3147
02:14:34,291 --> 02:14:36,360
you started playing your shit.
He'd be like,

3148
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:37,920
Hey,
listen to this pissed,

3149
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:38,670
pissed,
my favorite,

3150
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:40,560
my favorite shit.
But actually you knew who else it

3151
02:14:40,561 --> 02:14:43,260
happens too with,
with what you're saying is a,

3152
02:14:43,261 --> 02:14:47,550
my mother called me and she goes,
I bought your album and now every time I

3153
02:14:47,551 --> 02:14:50,490
get in the car it plays in.
How do I need to stop it from doing

3154
02:14:50,491 --> 02:14:52,290
that?
And that's my own mother.

3155
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:54,450
You know,
she's fucking sick of this shit.

3156
02:14:54,451 --> 02:14:59,451
So that's why I wonder why song or that
one bit rather plays every time.

3157
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:03,900
Every time I get in my car,
it starts off with that.

3158
02:15:04,230 --> 02:15:05,790
That's so it is,
that is weird.

3159
02:15:05,930 --> 02:15:07,350
Yeah.
It's very strange.

3160
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:11,280
But it's um,
what is your gangstarr one that goes,

3161
02:15:11,550 --> 02:15:13,560
it's a,
I think it's above the clouds,

3162
02:15:14,520 --> 02:15:17,160
which makes sense because it's
Alphabetical,

3163
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:18,390
right?
So,

3164
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:21,240
hmm.
But gangstarr but what I mean,

3165
02:15:22,170 --> 02:15:23,400
I dunno man.
Yeah.

3166
02:15:23,401 --> 02:15:24,870
I don't know what,
what it is.

3167
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:30,050
And sometimes if I plug in the phone
then it will also only play that song

3168
02:15:30,510 --> 02:15:33,300
and we'll let me fast forward or jumped
to another song.

3169
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:37,050
What is the name of that and bid?
I think it's called a good death.

3170
02:15:37,051 --> 02:15:37,591
Is it?
Oh,

3171
02:15:37,591 --> 02:15:38,424
that's why.
Hey.

3172
02:15:39,970 --> 02:15:42,000
Hey.
That's why I just want it to be

3173
02:15:42,690 --> 02:15:45,750
justified.
That's how every fucking day starts for

3174
02:15:45,751 --> 02:15:46,890
me.
It's because a,

3175
02:15:47,230 --> 02:15:49,340
yeah,
that must be a mass bay.

3176
02:15:49,470 --> 02:15:50,370
Well,
that's a good move.

3177
02:15:50,550 --> 02:15:55,550
I'm going to name all my bits.
A Big Dick Story.

3178
02:15:58,770 --> 02:16:03,770
Imagine if that was like what I did with
my special every fucking bit was called

3179
02:16:04,081 --> 02:16:06,390
a big Dick Story.
That's another big Dick.

3180
02:16:06,391 --> 02:16:07,050
I know.
Biggest,

3181
02:16:07,050 --> 02:16:11,430
my favorite big stick.
I had that thing where I,

3182
02:16:11,550 --> 02:16:16,020
that was kind of the idea behind when I
did my first album called thrilled where

3183
02:16:16,021 --> 02:16:18,600
I do like a parody of Michael Jackson's
thriller.

3184
02:16:18,930 --> 02:16:22,060
The whole idea,
like part of the fun of that was so that

3185
02:16:22,061 --> 02:16:24,450
I,
cause I knew that people who got the

3186
02:16:24,451 --> 02:16:29,130
album had a good chance of in their
library having it next to Michael

3187
02:16:29,130 --> 02:16:30,430
Jackson's,
you know that was,

3188
02:16:30,431 --> 02:16:33,100
that's fine.
And people send me screen grabs,

3189
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:36,610
they send me screen grabs of their
library.

3190
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:38,740
They're like,
you're a part of that picture is,

3191
02:16:39,250 --> 02:16:43,960
I love how you trimmed your neck,
but you chest is like a wall between,

3192
02:16:43,961 --> 02:16:47,680
you face your hair and then you have
like this bridge of no hair.

3193
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:50,770
So much hair.
That should be the name of my next

3194
02:16:50,771 --> 02:16:52,360
album.
So much hair.

3195
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,810
So people send you screen grabs of them,
have their phone being like it's you and

3196
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,850
it's like me and Michael Jackson,
you know,

3197
02:17:00,970 --> 02:17:02,620
like side by side.
Thrilled.

3198
02:17:03,130 --> 02:17:07,540
That's hilarious.
Chest hair in a fucking chain.

3199
02:17:08,350 --> 02:17:10,390
Something about chest hair and chained
together.

3200
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:13,000
Yeah.
Attract a very specific type of woman

3201
02:17:13,001 --> 02:17:14,380
with that look.
Oh yeah.

3202
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:16,480
Chest hair and chains.
Yeah.

3203
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:20,440
It's the kind that will scoop and score.
I thought that sculpin score.

3204
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:22,960
Have you heard a,
if you watched F is for family yet?

3205
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:25,450
I did.
I saw the first episode.

3206
02:17:25,451 --> 02:17:27,220
I just saw the fucking funny,
isn't it?

3207
02:17:27,350 --> 02:17:28,620
I love the neighbor.
Yeah,

3208
02:17:28,650 --> 02:17:30,040
I was thinking of him.
Oh yeah.

3209
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:32,920
Gold chains.
And the driver says awesome.

3210
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:34,870
Yeah.
I saw a funny series,

3211
02:17:34,900 --> 02:17:35,980
man killed it,
man.

3212
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:39,040
That's awesome.
Apparently Louis Louis C K is going to

3213
02:17:39,041 --> 02:17:41,080
do an animated series now too.
Oh really?

3214
02:17:41,110 --> 02:17:43,940
Those gingers and taking over man
gingers are fucking run it.

3215
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:44,700
Yeah,
man.

3216
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:45,131
It's,
you know,

3217
02:17:45,131 --> 02:17:45,980
it's,
you know what it is.

3218
02:17:45,981 --> 02:17:48,820
It's like a lot of lack of pussy.
When you're young,

3219
02:17:48,850 --> 02:17:51,310
it's hard to get laid.
That tension builds up.

3220
02:17:51,520 --> 02:17:56,520
You get an upset focus and drive focus
and drive that redheaded focus and

3221
02:17:56,701 --> 02:17:58,810
drive.
So he's going to do an animated one.

3222
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,490
Yeah.
He's apparently going to do an animal.

3223
02:18:00,500 --> 02:18:02,290
You went to animated series,
man.

3224
02:18:02,790 --> 02:18:04,600
It's so you could get away with so much.
I mean,

3225
02:18:04,601 --> 02:18:08,110
think about what South Park has gotten
away with the stuff that they can do.

3226
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:10,330
What [inaudible] and butthead dead.
Yeah.

3227
02:18:10,410 --> 02:18:11,570
Back in the day.
Yeah.

3228
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:15,430
When aren't they gone to Redo Beavis and
butthead?

3229
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:16,571
They did.
Right.

3230
02:18:16,571 --> 02:18:19,570
But nobody cared anymore.
But he's doing that hbo show.

3231
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:20,860
Mike Judd?
Yeah.

3232
02:18:21,130 --> 02:18:22,030
What?
Silicone Valley.

3233
02:18:22,450 --> 02:18:23,380
Oh,
that's right.

3234
02:18:23,390 --> 02:18:24,490
His,
that's a good show.

3235
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:28,360
That's another funny show.
Is this the best time ever to be just a

3236
02:18:28,361 --> 02:18:29,110
fucking loser?

3237
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:31,300
Sits in front of the TV without doubt.
This is the best,

3238
02:18:31,330 --> 02:18:33,160
best tv shows ever,
ever.

3239
02:18:33,340 --> 02:18:36,610
TV has for a while now.
Just leapt over.

3240
02:18:37,020 --> 02:18:39,420
Moving same cinema.
Just not even close.

3241
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:42,430
Not even close.
I think about what you can do with a TV

3242
02:18:42,431 --> 02:18:43,001
man.
Well,

3243
02:18:43,001 --> 02:18:46,120
the thing about TV is like something
like game of thrones.

3244
02:18:46,121 --> 02:18:49,630
It's like a new movie every week and
it's tied together.

3245
02:18:50,050 --> 02:18:51,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

3246
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:52,570
In a movie.
I mean,

3247
02:18:52,571 --> 02:18:55,990
how much can you really get attached to
a character in a two hour film?

3248
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:59,950
It kind of can,
but not like the way you can't over 10

3249
02:18:59,951 --> 02:19:04,090
1520 episodes season for sure.
He knew what else I like that these

3250
02:19:04,091 --> 02:19:06,820
television shows,
whether it's narcos or whether it's game

3251
02:19:06,821 --> 02:19:09,400
of thrones,
they're largely unknown actors.

3252
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:13,360
So you associate them with the actual
character instead of going,

3253
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:15,640
Oh,
here's beneath old del Toro playing

3254
02:19:15,641 --> 02:19:16,660
another crazy guy.

3255
02:19:16,720 --> 02:19:17,171
Right,
right,

3256
02:19:17,171 --> 02:19:18,610
right.
That happens a lot.

3257
02:19:18,611 --> 02:19:19,930
Yes.
That's big man,

3258
02:19:19,931 --> 02:19:21,940
because when I go to the movies and I
see Tom Cruise,

3259
02:19:21,941 --> 02:19:25,210
I'm seeing Tom fucking cruise.
I'm not seeing some mad scientist.

3260
02:19:25,211 --> 02:19:28,160
I'm not seeing a private agent,
no secret agent.

3261
02:19:28,161 --> 02:19:31,730
I'm seeing Tom Parking cruise.
He's famous or Bradley Cooper or

3262
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:33,440
Jennifer Lawrence.
I'm seeing them.

3263
02:19:33,441 --> 02:19:35,240
I know it's them.
You can't lie to me.

3264
02:19:35,470 --> 02:19:39,380
It's why those actors that were really
that really get into play and parts

3265
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:43,100
stand out so much like the way that
Phillip Seymour Hoffman used to play

3266
02:19:43,101 --> 02:19:45,620
roles.
You lose yourself in his role because he

3267
02:19:45,621 --> 02:19:49,580
was so committed to not being the actor.
He was the park.

3268
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:53,270
Daniel Day Lewis is my favorite example
of that fucking guy.

3269
02:19:53,271 --> 02:19:57,470
When he did that boxer moving,
he did nothing but box for a year,

3270
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:01,160
really for a year.
All we did was go to the boxing gym

3271
02:20:01,190 --> 02:20:02,390
every day and train.

3272
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:05,510
He looked.
He's the only guy that I've ever seen in

3273
02:20:05,511 --> 02:20:10,280
a movie where he actually looked like a
real boxer when he was doing the scenes.

3274
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:14,930
It was like if you watched the fighter
with Marky Mark Wahlberg and he's

3275
02:20:14,931 --> 02:20:15,860
playing,
um,

3276
02:20:16,410 --> 02:20:19,160
I'm a tour guide.
Micky Ward,

3277
02:20:19,161 --> 02:20:22,060
he playing Micky Ward,
he doesn't live it.

3278
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:24,380
Got Boxer and I say,
God knows how to throw punches.

3279
02:20:24,620 --> 02:20:26,240
Jillian Hall.
Do you think he looked like a box?

3280
02:20:26,270 --> 02:20:27,380
I didn't see that movie.
Yeah,

3281
02:20:28,410 --> 02:20:32,090
the Marky mark movie.
He doesn't look like a guy who's

3282
02:20:32,091 --> 02:20:34,430
actually been boxing.
He looks like a guy who knows how to

3283
02:20:34,431 --> 02:20:36,800
throw punches.
But there's a big difference between a

3284
02:20:36,801 --> 02:20:39,890
guy who knows how to throw punches and a
guy who knows how to throw punches,

3285
02:20:39,891 --> 02:20:44,360
anticipating that so many punches back
and the idea of an actual boxer,

3286
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:47,420
there's a difference between knowing
that a guy's going to stand in front of

3287
02:20:47,421 --> 02:20:50,690
you like a rocky movie or a guy who
looks like a boxer.

3288
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:54,110
And Daniel Day Lewis was the only guy
I've ever seen in a movie that actually

3289
02:20:54,111 --> 02:20:56,480
looked like a boxer.
He,

3290
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:59,630
this is him.
This is him jumping rope.

3291
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:02,600
But maybe there's a,
Oh,

3292
02:21:02,601 --> 02:21:04,210
that's him actually jumping rope.
Yeah.

3293
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:06,440
Look how good he's jumping rope.
Holy Shit.

3294
02:21:07,690 --> 02:21:09,020
That shit,
man.

3295
02:21:09,290 --> 02:21:10,670
Yeah.
That guy's an animal man.

3296
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:13,250
He really is an animal.
That motherfucker,

3297
02:21:13,910 --> 02:21:14,990
he,
he,

3298
02:21:14,991 --> 02:21:16,130
when he did that,
uh,

3299
02:21:16,160 --> 02:21:19,580
my left foot,
he was in character like for like a

3300
02:21:19,581 --> 02:21:20,121
year.
Well,

3301
02:21:20,121 --> 02:21:23,900
they said he was like that for,
there will be blood stays in character.

3302
02:21:24,050 --> 02:21:25,940
That's probably annoying as fuck it's
gotta be.

3303
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:28,610
Imagine if you do it in a movie like
Lincoln and nobody gives a shit.

3304
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:32,240
How about offset,
you know,

3305
02:21:32,300 --> 02:21:34,480
lunches or dinner with them.
Oh,

3306
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:37,110
have a milkshake and they're like,
come on.

3307
02:21:37,310 --> 02:21:38,630
Hey Ben.
Sorry.

3308
02:21:39,080 --> 02:21:39,760
Yeah,
it's,

3309
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:43,010
it's gonna wear on you score.
And seven years ago,

3310
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:44,780
and nobody gave a fuck about that movie.

3311
02:21:44,930 --> 02:21:49,930
More people cared about the,
the Abraham Lincoln versus the vampire

3312
02:21:50,001 --> 02:21:51,620
movie.
Abraham Lincoln,

3313
02:21:51,621 --> 02:21:54,410
vampire hunter.
More people cared about that movie then.

3314
02:21:54,411 --> 02:21:56,770
Then the Daniel Day,
Lewis Abraham Lincoln went,

3315
02:21:56,771 --> 02:21:57,860
yeah,
I believe that.

3316
02:21:58,010 --> 02:22:00,170
What is that?
We don't give a fuck about historical

3317
02:22:00,171 --> 02:22:01,850
movies.
I don't know.

3318
02:22:01,851 --> 02:22:03,530
Sometimes they take off.
Right.

3319
02:22:03,560 --> 02:22:05,660
I think part of it is nameless this,
well,

3320
02:22:05,661 --> 02:22:08,440
no,
I think part of it is now is that we

3321
02:22:08,460 --> 02:22:11,720
have seen a lot like there's a point
where you go,

3322
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:15,200
I know even though it might be worth
telling,

3323
02:22:15,440 --> 02:22:20,440
I've seen a number of Holocaust movies
or I've seen a number of civil rights,

3324
02:22:21,380 --> 02:22:24,830
you know,
American story like so when those come

3325
02:22:24,831 --> 02:22:26,970
out go,
I kind of know the story,

3326
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:28,300
right?
So I think that's where the,

3327
02:22:28,330 --> 02:22:30,570
the interest,
the box office goes down and people go,

3328
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:33,840
well I know,
I know this story and you can retell it

3329
02:22:33,930 --> 02:22:36,000
or tell it in a new way or interesting
way.

3330
02:22:36,001 --> 02:22:41,001
But people feel like I got it right.
I've seen the story does,

3331
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:45,840
it doesn't feel like new,
but it was for for a moment it's boring.

3332
02:22:46,410 --> 02:22:48,390
We don't want to hear about it.
Went on to hear about history.

3333
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:52,920
I want space ships and I want aliens and
laser beams and explosions.

3334
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:54,420
Did you say a force awakens?
Yes,

3335
02:22:54,421 --> 02:22:56,660
I did.
What'd you think of a date?

3336
02:22:56,790 --> 02:22:59,880
Haven't seen it yet.
You should before I tell you everything

3337
02:22:59,881 --> 02:23:00,714
that happened.

3338
02:23:02,970 --> 02:23:04,830
I do want to see it.
It's good,

3339
02:23:04,831 --> 02:23:06,330
man.
I was obsessed with him and I was a kid.

3340
02:23:06,390 --> 02:23:08,050
I enjoy the shit out of it.
Yeah,

3341
02:23:08,180 --> 02:23:11,670
it's,
it's a perfect blend of new and old.

3342
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:16,110
It's a perfect homage.
It captures the essence of the original

3343
02:23:16,111 --> 02:23:19,440
films,
but with much more updated special

3344
02:23:19,441 --> 02:23:22,170
effects,
graphic storytelling and acting is

3345
02:23:22,171 --> 02:23:24,300
really good too.
There's nothing bad about it.

3346
02:23:24,510 --> 02:23:25,830
I loved it.
I've used,

3347
02:23:25,831 --> 02:23:27,980
started watching,
we were talking about netflix making of

3348
02:23:27,981 --> 02:23:29,100
a murderer.
No,

3349
02:23:29,101 --> 02:23:32,310
I have not get your entire life
together.

3350
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:36,690
I know.
I need to.

3351
02:23:36,900 --> 02:23:39,660
Everybody keeps fucking telling me.
That is the number one thing that people

3352
02:23:39,661 --> 02:23:40,880
tweet me about.
Other than that,

3353
02:23:40,980 --> 02:23:44,070
I'm wrong about Bernie Sanders.
I'm not my party candidate.

3354
02:23:44,500 --> 02:23:47,580
He not say 90%.
He said he's okay with it.

3355
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:50,150
It's not too much.
If it's over a certain amount,

3356
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:52,973
I'm not done with it.

3357
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:54,480
Feel the burn.
You're going to,

3358
02:23:54,530 --> 02:23:56,610
it's shit your pants.
I keep saying,

3359
02:23:56,670 --> 02:23:57,750
I keep hearing that.
Um,

3360
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:02,930
apparently I've listened to a radio lab
podcast that talked about the exact same

3361
02:24:03,601 --> 02:24:04,650
story.
It is,

3362
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:05,790
right.
I looked it up.

3363
02:24:05,791 --> 02:24:09,300
It came out in like 2013 they weren't,
they left out,

3364
02:24:09,830 --> 02:24:12,000
uh,
all the corruption going on in the

3365
02:24:12,001 --> 02:24:12,510
movie.
Yeah.

3366
02:24:12,510 --> 02:24:15,270
Yeah.
The state side of the story and the,

3367
02:24:15,271 --> 02:24:17,850
the states side of the story and the
woman's side of the story who accused

3368
02:24:17,851 --> 02:24:22,851
the man of rape and she thought,
I dunno the level of conspiracy involved

3369
02:24:24,691 --> 02:24:25,524
in this.
It's just,

3370
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:26,850
it's mind blowing.
Yeah.

3371
02:24:26,851 --> 02:24:29,490
The radio lab thing didn't cover that at
all.

3372
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:31,740
That's what really,
that kind of sucks.

3373
02:24:31,741 --> 02:24:33,060
They couldn't have though.
They do.

3374
02:24:33,061 --> 02:24:35,400
Radio lab only had an hour,
two hours.

3375
02:24:35,420 --> 02:24:39,150
He's got to do 10 episodes that same
little over an hour.

3376
02:24:39,151 --> 02:24:41,280
He'd see.
That's where something like Netflix

3377
02:24:41,340 --> 02:24:42,480
fucking shines.

3378
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:44,520
Yeah.
Cause you can't do that anywhere else.

3379
02:24:44,521 --> 02:24:46,080
Yeah.
They won't let you know,

3380
02:24:46,081 --> 02:24:48,300
like my new special six hours.
Wow.

3381
02:24:48,301 --> 02:24:51,030
That's amazing.
Are you naked in all of it and most of

3382
02:24:51,031 --> 02:24:53,100
it,
beginning of the end was a lot of

3383
02:24:53,101 --> 02:24:56,130
asshole shots or I don't know that
there's a lot of what I tried to do.

3384
02:24:56,131 --> 02:24:58,430
I do the diaper change style.
I'm going to do the face down.

3385
02:24:58,970 --> 02:25:01,830
I do both.
I had a guy come up to me at the fucking

3386
02:25:01,831 --> 02:25:05,730
Improv the other day,
asked me to do a comedy and a nudist

3387
02:25:05,790 --> 02:25:06,780
camp.
He's like,

3388
02:25:06,781 --> 02:25:07,530
it's amazing.
We,

3389
02:25:07,530 --> 02:25:09,870
everyone who performs,
they perform naked.

3390
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:11,100
I go,
Oh yeah,

3391
02:25:11,430 --> 02:25:12,360
okay.
Uh Huh.

3392
02:25:12,440 --> 02:25:13,770
And he goes,
who are you interested in doing?

3393
02:25:13,771 --> 02:25:14,490
I go,
nope.

3394
02:25:14,490 --> 02:25:15,091
See Ya.
He goes,

3395
02:25:15,091 --> 02:25:15,721
oh,
come on man.

3396
02:25:15,721 --> 02:25:16,170
You,
I go,

3397
02:25:16,170 --> 02:25:17,970
hey dude,
you're not going to see my cock.

3398
02:25:18,090 --> 02:25:18,450
Yeah.

3399
02:25:18,450 --> 02:25:19,440
Okay.
You want to,

3400
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:21,240
yeah.
This is your elaborate method.

3401
02:25:21,241 --> 02:25:24,160
Guy was clearly gay by the way.
He was going for that car.

3402
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:26,220
Then you have us.
Who was the guy that was dying to see

3403
02:25:26,221 --> 02:25:27,054
you?
Or was that a,

3404
02:25:27,130 --> 02:25:31,600
was that a gym or something and you have
a guy somewhere that was eyeballing you,

3405
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:34,600
something like that.
Was it working out every day,

3406
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:35,351
bro.
But I mean,

3407
02:25:35,351 --> 02:25:40,000
you know,
I did just scout at a,

3408
02:25:40,001 --> 02:25:42,430
uh,
at a gay gym for a while when I was on

3409
02:25:42,431 --> 02:25:45,240
news radio.
I worked at,

3410
02:25:45,241 --> 02:25:47,380
at a gold's gym on coal,
but like the same,

3411
02:25:47,710 --> 02:25:50,490
like the same guy waiting all the call.
That wasn't,

3412
02:25:50,500 --> 02:25:51,550
no,
that was in Jujitsu,

3413
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:53,170
Jujitsu.
That was the sky.

3414
02:25:53,190 --> 02:25:56,650
Well we had to kick that guy out.
He was just like hang back.

3415
02:25:57,490 --> 02:25:59,920
He would wait for me to get dressed but
he waited for everybody to get trust and

3416
02:25:59,921 --> 02:26:00,880
he would harass guys.

3417
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:04,720
He was like say a bunch of creepy sexual
shit to people when they were changing.

3418
02:26:04,820 --> 02:26:06,110
Yeah.
Which uh,

3419
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:10,090
it's end.
He also would go and do Jujitsu and

3420
02:26:10,091 --> 02:26:12,570
purposely get his ass kicked.
Dicey.

3421
02:26:12,571 --> 02:26:15,520
You're manhandling them.
We want it to like you barely fight back

3422
02:26:15,521 --> 02:26:17,080
man.
Like I remember he roll with this one

3423
02:26:17,081 --> 02:26:19,690
guy and the guy tapped him like really
quick and they got to realize he wasn't

3424
02:26:19,691 --> 02:26:21,990
fighting back and like looked at them
and they looked at and the,

3425
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:23,410
and the guy tried to keep going and
goes,

3426
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:25,390
no,
I'm dumb and we're not doing this,

3427
02:26:25,391 --> 02:26:26,920
doing this.
First of all,

3428
02:26:26,921 --> 02:26:30,240
you just came all over yourself.
That's making me a couple.

3429
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:31,840
He said to my friend Brad,
he said,

3430
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:34,270
sometimes I just come here to get my ass
kicked.

3431
02:26:34,300 --> 02:26:37,030
Come on man.
This is not the place.

3432
02:26:37,090 --> 02:26:39,370
And this is Brett was one of the guys
that got him kicked out of there because

3433
02:26:39,371 --> 02:26:41,110
he would just say creepy sexual shit
though.

3434
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:42,910
That's crazy.
He would say weird shit.

3435
02:26:42,911 --> 02:26:44,350
The guys,
you know,

3436
02:26:44,650 --> 02:26:45,483
like one time,
uh,

3437
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:46,511
I,
I wear,

3438
02:26:46,511 --> 02:26:49,540
I would wear a jockstrap and then,
uh,

3439
02:26:49,541 --> 02:26:52,750
over my jock strap,
I would put a cup on [inaudible],

3440
02:26:52,990 --> 02:26:55,120
you know,
and the cop goes in a jockstrap he goes,

3441
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:57,270
yeah,
you were a two jock straps.

3442
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:00,520
And I just looked at him like,
why are you staring at me getting

3443
02:27:00,521 --> 02:27:02,310
changed and commenting?
I'm on a blighted.

3444
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:03,370
Yeah,
shut the fuck up,

3445
02:27:03,371 --> 02:27:04,720
man.
This is weird.

3446
02:27:04,810 --> 02:27:07,570
And the way we do it,
it's like this longing looking at his

3447
02:27:07,571 --> 02:27:09,990
face.
Like he's just hoping that you just just

3448
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:12,670
pull your car got and just stuff it and
get mug

3449
02:27:15,550 --> 02:27:18,640
throat.
Tell us sweet freedom.

3450
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:20,980
There was none of that.
That's another thing about the evolution

3451
02:27:20,981 --> 02:27:23,890
of porn to things that have happened
that have been pretty radical.

3452
02:27:23,891 --> 02:27:26,080
One,
no one has hair pussy anymore,

3453
02:27:26,650 --> 02:27:27,580
puts her hair,
puts it,

3454
02:27:27,581 --> 02:27:28,340
turns out the war.

3455
02:27:28,340 --> 02:27:29,260
Yeah,
it's gone.

3456
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:32,890
The radical crazy girl has a little
landing strip.

3457
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:34,570
Oh my God,
she's crazy.

3458
02:27:34,571 --> 02:27:36,040
Like a little Bush.
He like some Bush.

3459
02:27:36,320 --> 02:27:39,790
It's not that I like it or dislike it.
I have no problem with not getting pubic

3460
02:27:39,791 --> 02:27:42,430
hair in my mouth,
but what I'm thinking is kids today,

3461
02:27:42,431 --> 02:27:46,510
they don't know what it's like to get a
pubic hair stuck in between your teeth.

3462
02:27:46,530 --> 02:27:48,970
Yeah.
They don't want to set up yes for us.

3463
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,170
Sure.
That feeling.

3464
02:27:50,410 --> 02:27:53,200
Yeah.
We have it in your Tanya so he can't get

3465
02:27:53,201 --> 02:27:56,060
it out and even if you get it out,
you think he's still in there.

3466
02:27:58,190 --> 02:28:02,590
You never get it out.
You actually don't use that move for

3467
02:28:02,591 --> 02:28:04,900
anything else than removing pubic hairs
from your mouth.

3468
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:09,100
Maybe if you bite a Napkin,
if you take a Napkin and bite into it

3469
02:28:09,101 --> 02:28:12,310
and chew it and then he got up,
but why would you do that?

3470
02:28:12,311 --> 02:28:14,940
Right,
but you eat a lot of pussy have to

3471
02:28:15,300 --> 02:28:17,680
hairs.
I spent a lot of hairs in my youth.

3472
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:20,170
Sure that somewhere online it just
stopped.

3473
02:28:20,900 --> 02:28:22,100
It's silence.

3474
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:24,680
The fucking,
the trees were all chopped down like

3475
02:28:24,681 --> 02:28:27,110
what happened?
What happened to the forest?

3476
02:28:27,670 --> 02:28:30,920
Just stuffy in there.
It's weird.

3477
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:34,370
It's just stopped growing pussy hair.
When you saw it.

3478
02:28:34,371 --> 02:28:36,440
Girls get one of yours and then they
stop.

3479
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:37,820
You're like,
could you get back to it?

3480
02:28:38,810 --> 02:28:39,643
And they're like,
what?

3481
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:46,220
But some,
some change happen both in pornography

3482
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:51,500
and in people.
And it's almost like pornography became

3483
02:28:51,501 --> 02:28:55,640
more popular because of like blockbuster
and vhs tapes.

3484
02:28:55,710 --> 02:28:58,100
Sure.
Remember they have those local video

3485
02:28:58,101 --> 02:28:59,690
stores.
Of course you have to go through the

3486
02:28:59,691 --> 02:29:03,080
fucking saloon doors to get to with that
open a year,

3487
02:29:03,081 --> 02:29:04,540
young,
uh,

3488
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:06,980
adrenaline rush walking through those
doors.

3489
02:29:07,480 --> 02:29:11,230
You feel people don't,
I know if you were on,

3490
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:15,530
if you were visiting someone in prison
and you had to go to jail lockdown area,

3491
02:29:16,170 --> 02:29:17,450
yeah.
It really was.

3492
02:29:18,200 --> 02:29:20,660
I remember buying to buying porn in
those.

3493
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:22,580
And you know,
you buy,

3494
02:29:22,581 --> 02:29:24,110
if you go to a porn store,
it's funny,

3495
02:29:24,111 --> 02:29:27,200
but if you go to a regular store that
has porn and you buy a porn and then you

3496
02:29:27,201 --> 02:29:29,900
get the checkout person who was like
totally judging you,

3497
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:32,540
you're a real fucking pig.
You know that.

3498
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:34,400
You can be so nervous.
Oh,

3499
02:29:34,401 --> 02:29:36,100
so nor honorable.
I remember the,

3500
02:29:36,160 --> 02:29:38,030
uh,
some of the checkout person one time was

3501
02:29:38,031 --> 02:29:39,590
like,
you want me to throw away the box for

3502
02:29:39,591 --> 02:29:41,240
you?
A lot of people don't like the box.

3503
02:29:41,241 --> 02:29:42,150
I was like,
I'll take the puck,

3504
02:29:42,170 --> 02:29:43,760
put it in a fucking bag,
let's go to the box.

3505
02:29:43,761 --> 02:29:45,800
Might collect them,
collect the boxes,

3506
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:46,753
a frame,
the boxes.

3507
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:50,570
If you're going to be an order,
how am I going to know the order if I

3508
02:29:50,571 --> 02:29:52,520
don't have the box?
I need a box.

3509
02:29:53,210 --> 02:29:54,043
Yeah.
Um,

3510
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:55,820
the saloon door thing.

3511
02:29:56,720 --> 02:30:00,380
So I think people started buying them.
They started renting them,

3512
02:30:00,410 --> 02:30:02,000
right?
And they started taking them home and

3513
02:30:02,001 --> 02:30:03,740
then they started going,
what's all the hair?

3514
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:05,770
Yeah.
And then something happened where the

3515
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:10,400
industry recognized that it's looks
weird when you see all this asshole hair

3516
02:30:10,401 --> 02:30:13,250
and you're good to fucking camera three
inches away from it.

3517
02:30:13,251 --> 02:30:16,980
And some dudes,
hairy ass and his ball bag or slapping

3518
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,290
up against her area.
And I'm like,

3519
02:30:18,291 --> 02:30:19,310
look,
we've got to clean this up.

3520
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:20,380
We've got to clean this up.
Okay.

3521
02:30:20,410 --> 02:30:24,080
And so they somewhere along the line
don't on what year it was the eighties

3522
02:30:24,081 --> 02:30:28,430
maybe they started all the shaving down
like ace and had some hair.

3523
02:30:28,460 --> 02:30:31,100
I think it was to me I think it was the
shift in the high def.

3524
02:30:31,550 --> 02:30:33,290
Ah,
you might be right.

3525
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:37,560
Took the airway well it's also people
got bored with the regular product.

3526
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:40,820
So we were talking about earlier like
why are they still making porn?

3527
02:30:41,360 --> 02:30:46,360
Well obviously it came a point in time
where they had to shift from just two

3528
02:30:46,431 --> 02:30:50,560
people meeting the pizza guy.
Come on in,

3529
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:53,610
I don't have any money but I can pay you
in another one.

3530
02:30:54,230 --> 02:30:57,830
Something happened along the way were
porn itself changed?

3531
02:30:57,831 --> 02:31:01,670
Like they got tired of those scenarios
and then it became like rough porn and

3532
02:31:01,730 --> 02:31:04,430
gagging and Mascara running.
It's not,

3533
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:11,950
those are really crazy still.
Oh my God I saw this one with this girl.

3534
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:17,140
They laid her down on a bed and her head
hung off the edge of the bed and guys

3535
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:20,070
just took turns.
Just mouth fucking

3536
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:25,070
are balls into her nose and slobber and
like she was like puking up saliva,

3537
02:31:28,561 --> 02:31:33,360
like coughing and spitting and that she
would and they would just be right back

3538
02:31:33,361 --> 02:31:37,020
in there and the next guy would do it.
And these guys were these giant cocked

3539
02:31:37,021 --> 02:31:41,940
black guys with these big meaty acids.
Pound her fucking mouth.

3540
02:31:42,610 --> 02:31:44,290
Yeah.
It was just whoa,

3541
02:31:44,291 --> 02:31:45,220
Whoa,
Whoa,

3542
02:31:45,221 --> 02:31:48,270
whoa man.
Who's asking for that?

3543
02:31:48,271 --> 02:31:51,780
Someone's clearly asking for that.
Do you think they just had figured out,

3544
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:53,730
you know,
we got to present this in a different

3545
02:31:53,731 --> 02:31:56,100
way?
I think it's probably the people that do

3546
02:31:56,101 --> 02:31:58,040
the porn,
like we're talking about mass hardcore

3547
02:31:58,050 --> 02:32:01,590
being so fucking crazy.
I think they just get so bored with sex.

3548
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:03,360
They're like,
no up,

3549
02:32:03,480 --> 02:32:07,200
I'm opening your ass home and throw my
keys in there that people have.

3550
02:32:07,201 --> 02:32:10,700
Like we're gonna play Jacks and when to
throw the jacks in your ass haul

3551
02:32:11,130 --> 02:32:12,150
something happened.

3552
02:32:12,150 --> 02:32:13,780
There's a proportion to that.
Yeah.

3553
02:32:14,130 --> 02:32:16,350
It went from missionary to like lay on
your back,

3554
02:32:16,380 --> 02:32:18,450
you know,
get a dog and then it's like,

3555
02:32:18,451 --> 02:32:20,610
you know,
tongue my balls from underneath.

3556
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:23,280
Let's go ask her mouth like someone was
the first worst Nigga.

3557
02:32:23,300 --> 02:32:24,470
I got an idea.
Yeah.

3558
02:32:24,570 --> 02:32:28,010
And then asked her mouth was born.
Is that safe to do so?

3559
02:32:28,470 --> 02:32:30,510
Genre,
ATM.

3560
02:32:30,740 --> 02:32:33,780
It's a genre,
you know milfs cause like a,

3561
02:32:33,790 --> 02:32:35,790
a bunch of different genres.
Guilty.

3562
02:32:35,810 --> 02:32:39,450
You can find these genres.
Kim An yeah,

3563
02:32:39,630 --> 02:32:43,770
Jesus Christ.
60 plattsmouth but because of that,

3564
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:49,160
the images that people saw in
pornography changed the way people take

3565
02:32:49,201 --> 02:32:50,710
care of their pubic hair.
Yeah.

3566
02:32:51,150 --> 02:32:53,610
It's 100% what it was.
That's the influence.

3567
02:32:53,940 --> 02:32:56,730
Pornography changed the way women trim
their pubic hair.

3568
02:32:56,940 --> 02:32:59,000
Maybe guys too.
Yeah,

3569
02:32:59,070 --> 02:33:02,210
definitely trim,
trimming it at all before.

3570
02:33:02,480 --> 02:33:04,500
Do you manscape down there?
Sure.

3571
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:07,470
Is it like your neck and the thriller
thing where it's like beard,

3572
02:33:07,471 --> 02:33:08,150
beard,
beard.

3573
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:10,020
It's no hair,
hair,

3574
02:33:10,021 --> 02:33:13,480
chest,
clean cock and clean bikini line.

3575
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:15,350
Hairy legs.
It would,

3576
02:33:15,351 --> 02:33:17,280
that would be so it just not as crazy
down there.

3577
02:33:17,281 --> 02:33:19,200
But yeah,
I definitely do some maintenance man.

3578
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:21,000
You know,
I like,

3579
02:33:21,030 --> 02:33:23,760
I like having a pretty clean ball bag.
That's a good move.

3580
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,520
And then you know,
hair grows on the shaft.

3581
02:33:26,550 --> 02:33:29,250
I trimmed that off too.
How much hair it grows in your chef.

3582
02:33:29,310 --> 02:33:32,560
There's like my beard.
Like this is no joke.

3583
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:37,140
He's a wolf man Werewolf.
I'll shave all around it and then we'll

3584
02:33:37,141 --> 02:33:38,730
trim all around that to save your
asshole.

3585
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,320
No,
I did it once.

3586
02:33:40,410 --> 02:33:42,660
I had it waxed once.
I did it once when I tweeted about it

3587
02:33:42,661 --> 02:33:44,040
and people got mad at me.
Why?

3588
02:33:44,210 --> 02:33:45,300
Oh,
it was great.

3589
02:33:45,360 --> 02:33:48,300
I got to say I want to go back to it
shaving your asshole.

3590
02:33:48,370 --> 02:33:51,030
I had it waxed.
And why did you do that for a radio

3591
02:33:51,031 --> 02:33:52,950
show.
But what radio show?

3592
02:33:53,080 --> 02:33:55,680
Bob and Tom,
they waxed your asshole.

3593
02:33:57,090 --> 02:34:00,450
But the um,
explained further please.

3594
02:34:01,190 --> 02:34:05,270
I met,
they made some comment about waxing and

3595
02:34:05,290 --> 02:34:08,670
hair and I said something to them like,
well the next time I'm in town I would

3596
02:34:08,671 --> 02:34:09,720
do that,
you know,

3597
02:34:09,780 --> 02:34:10,830
to my ass.
Cause I,

3598
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:14,130
I'd heard about how,
how ups your wife game so much.

3599
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,260
Oh yeah.
What a match.

3600
02:34:15,270 --> 02:34:16,500
Well,
they did it,

3601
02:34:16,501 --> 02:34:18,160
it was fine.
Like it wasn't that crazy

3602
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:21,080
to do.
It wasn't as paint know who did it and

3603
02:34:21,150 --> 02:34:25,420
they had a uh,
local people that that wax male or a

3604
02:34:25,421 --> 02:34:27,970
female female,
a girl saw your asshole.

3605
02:34:28,090 --> 02:34:29,230
She waxed it.
Yeah.

3606
02:34:29,231 --> 02:34:30,820
She put that in there.
She got in there.

3607
02:34:30,850 --> 02:34:32,950
Did she have like those rubber made
gloves?

3608
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:34,630
She had some type of glove on.
Yeah.

3609
02:34:34,810 --> 02:34:35,561
Yeah,
yeah.

3610
02:34:35,561 --> 02:34:36,161
And then,
you know,

3611
02:34:36,161 --> 02:34:38,560
she was putting hot wax in my ass.
If she didn't,

3612
02:34:38,590 --> 02:34:39,550
you'd be like,
um,

3613
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:41,020
yeah.
Are you professional?

3614
02:34:41,170 --> 02:34:42,560
She's pulling it off with her teeth and
then,

3615
02:34:44,230 --> 02:34:47,250
but here's the thing,
users or finger nails for mips it away

3616
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:51,130
like a sticker.
The memory isn't even getting waxed.

3617
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:54,160
It's how great the wiping was for six
weeks after that,

3618
02:34:54,161 --> 02:34:56,350
six whole weeks until it stubble starts
kicking in.

3619
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:58,930
Yeah.
You have unbelievable taint itch.

3620
02:34:58,931 --> 02:35:01,810
Yes.
The taint itch was other level,

3621
02:35:02,170 --> 02:35:04,960
but I didn't even know what it was like
to not to,

3622
02:35:05,020 --> 02:35:06,160
to wipe a few times.

3623
02:35:06,670 --> 02:35:07,181
Yeah.
It'd be like,

3624
02:35:07,181 --> 02:35:08,014
yeah,
I'm done.

3625
02:35:08,110 --> 02:35:13,110
Because when you have a hairy ass,
oh shit under the top of your head,

3626
02:35:14,021 --> 02:35:16,450
a picture of that,
that's what you're doing with your hair

3627
02:35:16,451 --> 02:35:21,451
yet never quite get done.
Roll of toilet paper for a normal shit

3628
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:26,320
to clean my ass.
So disgust.

3629
02:35:26,321 --> 02:35:31,321
So one time I decided I was shaving my
ball bag and a I trim first and then I

3630
02:35:31,451 --> 02:35:32,890
get in the shower and then I use a
razor.

3631
02:35:32,891 --> 02:35:35,440
Right.
So a razor in my ball back.

3632
02:35:35,441 --> 02:35:36,280
No.
You know,

3633
02:35:36,281 --> 02:35:39,070
so I can get in there.
And so I lifted my leg up,

3634
02:35:39,280 --> 02:35:40,450
some quite flexible,
right?

3635
02:35:40,510 --> 02:35:43,660
I put my leg up on the wall and just
looked down there and just started

3636
02:35:43,661 --> 02:35:45,070
shaving away.
It just,

3637
02:35:45,071 --> 02:35:48,760
the visual is amazing.
Hacking fucking trees out of my asshole.

3638
02:35:48,970 --> 02:35:51,250
First of all,
I couldn't believe how long my asshole

3639
02:35:51,251 --> 02:35:52,370
Harris,
yeah.

3640
02:35:52,610 --> 02:35:54,910
Gets lost.
It gets like,

3641
02:35:54,911 --> 02:35:57,130
uh,
like more than a beard.

3642
02:35:57,820 --> 02:35:59,170
Yeah.
Like we're crazy beard.

3643
02:35:59,171 --> 02:36:02,970
Like maybe like a Rasputin type beard.
But how'd you feel after that?

3644
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:06,490
First of all,
my farts changed the sound.

3645
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:09,110
I was like,
I couldn't,

3646
02:36:09,110 --> 02:36:12,700
but it's almost like before I was like
farting through the forest and now it's

3647
02:36:12,701 --> 02:36:17,701
like all my farts like wet and so cause
it gets muffled with that.

3648
02:36:18,340 --> 02:36:21,190
Hey,
they sounded different.

3649
02:36:21,191 --> 02:36:23,590
Yeah,
they stayed literally sounded different

3650
02:36:23,591 --> 02:36:27,190
and it will louder now that they had
beautiful beef.

3651
02:36:27,191 --> 02:36:29,340
Creem was coming out of peak.

3652
02:36:34,620 --> 02:36:37,510
There's this guy that we found on our
podcasts.

3653
02:36:37,540 --> 02:36:39,400
What's his name?
His name is Thursday lane.

3654
02:36:39,610 --> 02:36:41,440
Oh this is another guy.
This isn't the other guy.

3655
02:36:41,441 --> 02:36:44,680
The finance not kicking ass rapper.
This guy,

3656
02:36:45,250 --> 02:36:47,650
this guy is named his,
yeah,

3657
02:36:47,710 --> 02:36:49,060
his name was,
his name is diego,

3658
02:36:49,061 --> 02:36:52,240
but he goes by Thursday lane and his a
fucking name.

3659
02:36:52,270 --> 02:36:52,841
Yeah,
he gets,

3660
02:36:52,841 --> 02:36:57,841
I got a rap name and he wants to be,
he wants to do fart fetish porn.

3661
02:36:58,511 --> 02:37:03,511
That's his dream.
So he posted all these videos about how

3662
02:37:03,671 --> 02:37:06,310
much he loves farts and that's how we
got in touch with him.

3663
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:11,050
And he has a description for whatever
type of hair color you have.

3664
02:37:11,290 --> 02:37:14,710
He associates it with a different type
of cream or broth.

3665
02:37:14,930 --> 02:37:18,260
That's the smell to him.
So if you have brown hair,

3666
02:37:18,261 --> 02:37:21,440
you have beef cream farts.
And if you have this is him.

3667
02:37:21,441 --> 02:37:22,274
This is him.
Yeah.

3668
02:37:22,280 --> 02:37:25,150
Thursday lane marries a fart.
Yeah.

3669
02:37:25,460 --> 02:37:26,293

3670
02:37:26,300 --> 02:37:27,680
Yeah.

3671
02:37:28,010 --> 02:37:31,190

02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:33,550
if you're a diabetic cock pit.
Your meat marrying.

3673
02:37:33,551 --> 02:37:35,670
Get farts where you're like the beef

3674
02:37:36,210 --> 02:37:37,080

3678
02:37:42,690 --> 02:37:43,620
One,

3679
02:37:44,200 --> 02:37:48,020
Oh Wow.
Other than made up for life.

3680
02:37:48,021 --> 02:37:50,130
Thank you.
These are the three lines on that.

3681
02:37:50,280 --> 02:37:52,910
So Guy Farts in his face and he gets
super excited.

3682
02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:53,850
Yeah.
He loves it.

3683
02:37:53,851 --> 02:37:55,380
Right?
I mean you don't understand.

3684
02:37:55,381 --> 02:37:57,540
So you know if you have,
um,

3685
02:37:57,570 --> 02:37:58,680
he really does like it.
Oh,

3686
02:37:58,681 --> 02:38:00,150
he loves it.
He's not kidding.

3687
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:02,650
No,
he just did a flip bullies.

3688
02:38:02,970 --> 02:38:06,810
Even the way Jesus Christ,
let's face it,

3689
02:38:06,860 --> 02:38:10,860
is eating that guys asked one of the guy
who was farting in his face is gay or

3690
02:38:10,861 --> 02:38:11,910
not.
I don't think he is.

3691
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:14,250
He works for that.
Cause we talked to that company.

3692
02:38:14,251 --> 02:38:16,020
To company.
Yeah,

3693
02:38:16,021 --> 02:38:17,430
because we,
we talked about them on a,

3694
02:38:17,440 --> 02:38:19,750
our podcast kind of company,
and we talking about it,

3695
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:21,840
it's hot movies.com or something like
that.

3696
02:38:21,841 --> 02:38:23,070
So they,
they,

3697
02:38:23,100 --> 02:38:26,550
they heard him on our podcast and then
they contacted him and shot that

3698
02:38:26,551 --> 02:38:28,540
interview.
Um,

3699
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:31,950
but he has a description for every hair
color.

3700
02:38:31,951 --> 02:38:34,170
So if you have,
if you have white hair,

3701
02:38:34,171 --> 02:38:36,300
he is,
you're a silver trout cream.

3702
02:38:37,230 --> 02:38:39,910
If you have blond hair,
your chicken cream if you have.

3703
02:38:40,150 --> 02:38:45,000
So he associates this,
it's really intense and he has a whole

3704
02:38:45,001 --> 02:38:47,820
list of and calls your farts.
Beautiful guppies.

3705
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:50,640
I'm like,
what the fuck is wrong with him?

3706
02:38:50,670 --> 02:38:52,800
He loves farts.
But did you ask him how this all

3707
02:38:52,801 --> 02:38:54,270
happened?
Yeah,

3708
02:38:54,271 --> 02:38:55,440
he,
he likes to ramble though,

3709
02:38:55,441 --> 02:38:57,070
so I couldn't really keep up,
you know,

3710
02:38:57,090 --> 02:38:59,550
it kind of goes off on some stuff and
you on the phone with them,

3711
02:38:59,551 --> 02:39:00,560
not real life.
Right.

3712
02:39:00,570 --> 02:39:01,650
So he was just,
I was like,

3713
02:39:01,651 --> 02:39:02,970
all right man,
we got to pull this in.

3714
02:39:03,420 --> 02:39:04,253
But,
um,

3715
02:39:04,290 --> 02:39:05,460
I,
I even said like,

3716
02:39:05,490 --> 02:39:06,570
oh,
I feel like I got a little,

3717
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:08,430
I got a little beef cream today.
He goes,

3718
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:09,353
hmm.

3719
02:39:14,180 --> 02:39:16,590
He,
there's all types of people out there in

3720
02:39:16,591 --> 02:39:19,380
this wacky world.
There's so many wacky people,

3721
02:39:19,410 --> 02:39:22,030
and if you met this guy and he was like,
I love far,

3722
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:23,910
nothing gives me off more.
If that's what gets me.

3723
02:39:23,911 --> 02:39:26,360
When people say they're bothered by
something that like,

3724
02:39:26,550 --> 02:39:28,770
would it bother you that that's what he
likes?

3725
02:39:28,771 --> 02:39:29,870
No.
Oh Shit,

3726
02:39:29,880 --> 02:39:31,110
we're comedians.
Yeah,

3727
02:39:31,111 --> 02:39:32,400
that's true.
Yeah.

3728
02:39:32,460 --> 02:39:33,540
Yeah.
I mean,

3729
02:39:33,570 --> 02:39:35,100
that is what it is.
We're freaks.

3730
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:37,560
We're not regular.
That's true.

3731
02:39:37,620 --> 02:39:38,900
I mean,
there's a lot of freaks out there that

3732
02:39:38,910 --> 02:39:40,980
have regular jobs that don't mind.
Don't care either,

3733
02:39:41,250 --> 02:39:42,330
but we're freaks.
Yeah.

3734
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:44,280
You know,
in terms of society.

3735
02:39:44,500 --> 02:39:46,350
Yeah.
We're about as freaky as it gets.

3736
02:39:46,560 --> 02:39:47,730
That's true.
We're,

3737
02:39:47,731 --> 02:39:49,240
we're looking for this stuff.
I mean,

3738
02:39:49,250 --> 02:39:50,700
you contacted this guy.
Yeah.

3739
02:39:51,150 --> 02:39:54,030
He wanted him on your show.
You get the throat master.

3740
02:39:54,031 --> 02:39:55,340
What's her name?
Through the zillow.

3741
02:39:55,360 --> 02:39:56,670
Yeah.
You had her on your show.

3742
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:57,553
True.
We

3743
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:00,680
were seeking it out.
Ah,

3744
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:02,350
and loving it.
Of course.

3745
02:40:02,351 --> 02:40:06,600
That's the best.
I wish I met somebody like that

3746
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:09,120
everyday.
Why not?

3747
02:40:09,121 --> 02:40:09,954
Right?
Yeah.

3748
02:40:11,070 --> 02:40:13,110
Yeah.
Just like a professional cycler.

3749
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:14,243
I got pee.

3750
02:40:14,380 --> 02:40:14,970
Oh,
well,

3751
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:15,803
we're done.
Anyway.

3752
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:17,310
It's five o'clock man.
Yeah,

3753
02:40:17,311 --> 02:40:19,890
we do three fucking hours.
God Damn a girl.

3754
02:40:20,070 --> 02:40:21,090
That was fun.
That was,

3755
02:40:21,150 --> 02:40:22,680
what are you doing here?
Right here?

3756
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:23,580
Monitor.
You're paying,

3757
02:40:23,581 --> 02:40:25,450
you're turning that on.
I'm turning it on and go pee.

3758
02:40:26,710 --> 02:40:27,650
Why?
Well,

3759
02:40:27,690 --> 02:40:28,523
I'm just,
I'm just,

3760
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:30,420
I'm a vlogger man.
Oh,

3761
02:40:30,421 --> 02:40:31,700
you're blogging.
I'm flogging.

3762
02:40:31,770 --> 02:40:32,341
I'm,
you know,

3763
02:40:32,341 --> 02:40:35,640
the people started saying that.
Excuse me.

3764
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:38,660
I'm not in support of people saying it.
I don't mind reading out of it.

3765
02:40:38,730 --> 02:40:40,050
I make fun of it.
And blogging.

3766
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:42,700
Blogging is a funny term to me.
Uh,

3767
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:44,430
feel weird standing there pointing at
that.

3768
02:40:44,431 --> 02:40:46,050
You have a handle on it.
Like it's a gun.

3769
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:48,990
It's a,
I've had it stick out of the jacket by

3770
02:40:48,991 --> 02:40:51,090
the way.
And I've seen some people's eyes go.

3771
02:40:51,180 --> 02:40:52,580
Let me ask you this.
Yeah.

3772
02:40:52,670 --> 02:40:54,990
Yeah.
Why that and not just a phone,

3773
02:40:55,010 --> 02:40:58,560
cause it seems like a phone would make
it easier to upload the videos just as

3774
02:40:58,561 --> 02:40:59,394
good.

3775
02:40:59,430 --> 02:41:02,310
It's not this,
this picture quality's got to be better,

3776
02:41:02,730 --> 02:41:04,410
but must better.
Yeah.

3777
02:41:04,470 --> 02:41:06,960
Jamie,
easier to edit those videos that Tara,

3778
02:41:06,961 --> 02:41:09,460
it's actually not so easy to get that
the video off your iphone.

3779
02:41:09,490 --> 02:41:11,940
You've got to connect it to your thing
and you can just take that card out and

3780
02:41:11,941 --> 02:41:13,720
plugging in your computer.
Oh.

3781
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:16,770
It's not like it's super hard,
but it's a little bit easier to deal

3782
02:41:16,771 --> 02:41:17,431
with those.
Okay.

3783
02:41:17,431 --> 02:41:18,450
I see what you're saying.
Okay.

3784
02:41:18,600 --> 02:41:19,081
Well,
you know,

3785
02:41:19,081 --> 02:41:21,870
I would think that just having a phone,
it's easy.

3786
02:41:21,930 --> 02:41:23,310
I always have a phone.
You're right.

3787
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:26,040
But I think this picture is better.
Yeah.

3788
02:41:26,220 --> 02:41:27,090
Oh,
I'm sure it's better.

3789
02:41:27,110 --> 02:41:27,381
Yeah,
yeah,

3790
02:41:27,381 --> 02:41:28,890
yeah.
I mean that thing sticks out.

3791
02:41:29,550 --> 02:41:30,690
That sticks out the,
the,

3792
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:32,200
the lens sticks out.
It's,

3793
02:41:32,201 --> 02:41:33,034
yeah,
that's real.

3794
02:41:33,090 --> 02:41:34,110
It's real.
It's a real shit.

3795
02:41:34,660 --> 02:41:35,670
Alright,
I'll knock it off.

3796
02:41:35,730 --> 02:41:36,181
All right.
No,

3797
02:41:36,181 --> 02:41:37,200
you don't have to knock it off.
Well,

3798
02:41:37,201 --> 02:41:38,580
you know,
um,

3799
02:41:38,610 --> 02:41:41,790
I just want to say everybody,
if you're watching this,

3800
02:41:41,791 --> 02:41:43,020
yes,
you need to,

3801
02:41:43,080 --> 02:41:47,580
you need to watch Tom Segura on Netflix
starting January 8th.

3802
02:41:47,730 --> 02:41:50,670
It's called mostly stories and it's
fucking hilarious.

3803
02:41:50,671 --> 02:41:53,490
And I've seen most of what mostly
stories is,

3804
02:41:53,760 --> 02:41:58,760
and it's gut wrenchingly hilarious.
You fucks go before you watch.

3805
02:41:58,801 --> 02:42:01,710
F is for family or Narcos or any of that
shit.

3806
02:42:01,740 --> 02:42:06,300
Watch mostly stories.
January 8th Friday on Netflix.

3807
02:42:10,860 --> 02:42:11,431
All right,
folks.

3808
02:42:11,431 --> 02:42:13,320
Thanks.
Rogan podcast is over.

3809
02:42:13,530 --> 02:42:15,900
Um,
Tom Segura on twitter,

3810
02:42:15,901 --> 02:42:18,990
or you could also listen to your mom's
house with,

3811
02:42:18,991 --> 02:42:20,730
uh,
Tom and his lovely wife,

3812
02:42:20,731 --> 02:42:24,330
Christina p.
Congratulations on the Little Bambino.

3813
02:42:24,331 --> 02:42:26,860
The little Thomas A.
Good or what is giant hall?

3814
02:42:28,070 --> 02:42:29,280
All right,
fuckers.

3815
02:42:29,281 --> 02:42:31,860
That's it for the week.
We'll be back next week with lots of

3816
02:42:32,070 --> 02:42:34,470
awesome people buy by.
Big Kiss.

3817
02:42:46,330 --> 02:42:46,430
Yeah.
