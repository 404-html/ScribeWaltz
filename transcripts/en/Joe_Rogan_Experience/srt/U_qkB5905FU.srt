1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,090
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,050
Joe Rogan podcast by night.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:11,841
Thanks for having me,
man.

4
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:13,310
I really appreciate it.
I'm glad you're here,

5
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:14,120
Jim.
Yeah,

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,953
you've got a very interesting setup and 
I've talked to quite a few people work 

7
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:21,280
with you and your unconventional ways 
and uh,

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,030
he just,
he got a great reputation,

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,290
just so you know.
Yeah.

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,560
Hey,
thank you so convinced of this time,

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,700
tiffany scientific.
Well,

12
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,860
that reverse hyper,
that machine that you create.

13
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,380
I've talked about that 100 times on my 
podcast.

14
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:37,010
Get that thing has done wonders for my 
back and uh,

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,740
it's just,
uh,

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,970
a genius product.
You're good.

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,600
It's a,
it's a genius product.

18
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:42,434
How did you invent that?

19
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,063
I broke my lower back in 1973.
You invented that thing in 73 while I 

20
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:51,720
started to exercise.
It's actually about 74 started,

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:55,130
but I brought my daughter back in 
[inaudible] 73 and I was on crutches for

22
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:58,510
10 months and no one was helping me,
so I just come out,

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,353
you know,
I'd do back extensions where you hook 

24
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:03,320
your ankles and raise your upper body,
but that would kill my back.

25
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:03,921
So I thought,
well,

26
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:06,680
if I did it in reverse,
so I jumped up on a platform,

27
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:07,850
dropped my legs,
raise them up,

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,410
pumped up my back,
didn't hurt,

29
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,660
and that's how,
that was the beginning stages of it.

30
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,390
And then years later we've always been a
private gym.

31
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,360
We're not open to the public,
so it was never out in the public.

32
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:21,350
And then I finally made a machine years 
later and got my first patent in 1994.

33
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,380
How is it that no one knows about that 
thing?

34
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:25,214
I mean,
how is it that it's not a gigantic 

35
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:27,764
success?

36
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,540
Uh,
well we were actually,

37
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,550
should we sell over a little bit over 
$100 a month?

38
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,340
100 machines a month?
Well,

39
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,550
I hope I've sold some of them for you 
and you have.

40
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,810
I want to thank you for that.
And that's the way you know,

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,840
is like sex once you have you gotta you 
gotTa keep it.

42
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,290
Yeah.
I don't remember how I heard about it.

43
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,900
I don't remember who initially told me 
about it,

44
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:51,880
but I was having some disc issues and 
they all want to cut you open man.

45
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,213
If you go to doctors,
they all want to fuse disks and cut you 

46
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,980
open and there's all this talk and I was
like,

47
00:01:56,981 --> 00:01:58,300
wow,
there's gotta be another way.

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,313
So then I started research and stuff and
I don't remember how I came upon the 

49
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:04,600
reverse hyper,
but I remember as soon as I saw it,

50
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:05,081
I went,
wow,

51
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:07,600
that's a genius idea because you're 
just.

52
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,560
The idea is right that when you're 
getting a bulging disk is because things

53
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:14,260
are getting compressed.
So just pull them apart.

54
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,223
Right?
We've got another machine that belt 

55
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,443
squat machine we usually for grappling,
we actually fight in there and it's 

56
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,530
just,
it's not a reverse every bit to traction

57
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:22,364
device as well,
so we do an enormous amount of work and 

58
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,990
at the same time as the restoration.
So what is the other one called?

59
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:30,350
It's called a belt squat machine.
A bell squat puts you in a platform with

60
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,810
a belt around your waist with maybe 100,
200,

61
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:33,644
300 pounds,
and then we grapple or or we spar or it 

62
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:37,754
could do anything.
We actually lift weights and we use an 

63
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:41,270
enormous amount of wage.
May Two thousand pounds in it,

64
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,880
but why?
It's building up your glutes and all the

65
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,723
old lower,
lower body is tractioning out your 

66
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:47,760
spine.
And it's um,

67
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,750
but the restoration street medicine next
day you don't even know you worked out,

68
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:53,870
but you've done thousands of pounds of 
work and that's why I've got the world's

69
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:54,704
strongest soon.

70
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,250
Wow.
So you started out as a power lifter.

71
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,203
Shadows apparently started limping.
Lifting I was 14 and then I went to my 

72
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,100
first time meeting 1966 and salt guys is
really built.

73
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,760
Never went back to Olympic lifting 
again.

74
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,380
And then a power lifted all my life.
Made top 10 for 34 years.

75
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,660
That's why I'm so beat up.
And uh,

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
but uh,
I love the sport.

77
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,630
I love the strength and power also loves
if it's,

78
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,110
if it's in time or weights,
I love it.

79
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,490
You know,
something you can measure,

80
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,441
you know,
it's,

81
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:23,590
it's,
it's good to be a.

82
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:27,010
I like to work with football because I,
I'd average three tents off,

83
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,890
12 linemen going in the nfl some when 
the NFL,

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,870
some didn't.
So you just never know.

85
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,900
But I like,
I like just basic things to statistics,

86
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,250
you know,
how strong are you,

87
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,900
how fast are,
you know,

88
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,460
for the person who doesn't understand 
this,

89
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:42,160
what is difference between power lifting
and Olympic lifting,

90
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,263
power lifting,
you've been squat and dead lift and 

91
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,484
Olympic lifting a clean jerk and snatch 
part of the things that absolute 

92
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,020
strength,
sport law the way could be very,

93
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,450
very slow,
uh,

94
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,380
and Olympic lifting because I could to 
clean,

95
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:55,030
you have four,
you have two poles,

96
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,670
front squat and a jerk,
whatever your weakest at touch,

97
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:58,570
what you're limited at.

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,690
But that's a speed strength sport.
And that means velocity.

99
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,430
Speed.
Strength is intermediate philosophy.

100
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,730
My sport had slow velocity and then if 
you jump,

101
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,743
that's explosive.
I'm explosive power and that's measured 

102
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:13,150
in past philosophies but didn't want to 
build explosive power.

103
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,830
You Gen and how'd you get involved with 
work when fighters,

104
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:21,250
because I know you work with Matt Brown 
and you worked with a bunch of guys.

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,031
Well,
not bunch.

106
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:22,864
Kevin Randleman.
Kevin Brown started Kevin Randleman and 

107
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:26,680
a tree.
Kevin has experimented.

108
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,514
First off,
I thought I was afraid I was going to 

109
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,954
hurt the guy.
It's not that you can't hurt these guys 

110
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,520
know they ever hurt me and then.
But that's how it started.

111
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,570
It was fun.
And uh,

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,880
back when Kevin,
you know,

113
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:36,743
when it was champion and one was,
you probably know when he was probably 

114
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,660
around 2000.
Um,

115
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,130
yeah,
it was somewhere in that range,

116
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,060
somewhere around there.

117
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,710
He was the UFC heavyweight champ.
I know.

118
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm trying to get,
um,

119
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,870
you know,
his buddy.

120
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:50,890
I'm Mark Coleman down here and I'd never
get marked down here.

121
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,990
I went to his house twice.
I thought he's going to kick my ass.

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,273
I got it all psyched up and he starts 
staring me down to rock it back and 

123
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:57,094
forth and I don't really shit.
And then I tried to calm me down to get 

124
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,324
the hell out of there.
And then he said he wanted to talk to 

125
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,450
him again about a month ago.
My Guy.

126
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,523
So I go back up there.
Same thing happened and then I asked 

127
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,111
Kevin,
I said,

128
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:09,010
Kevin,
why you wanted to come down?

129
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,710
And he said,
well,

130
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,940
he said he'd have to train.
I trained optimally.

131
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:13,774
I don't train on smartsheet optimally,
you only need to have a bunch of stuff 

132
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,304
out in the first round.

133
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,250
He trained everything optimally,
not minimal,

134
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,690
not maximal.
It's optimal.

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,980
So when you take a guy like Kevin random
and like a stud athlete like that,

136
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,070
like how would you assess like what 
optimum is for a guy like that,

137
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,820
but that's when he was the first guy I 
ever had.

138
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:34,690
And you know what a freak he was on men.
So I'm Tom,

139
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,330
which a lot of guys right now and I mean
Kevin was used freak.

140
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,203
You saw Kevin?
Yeah.

141
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,530
So uh,
we do a lot of sled work,

142
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:42,364
upper body,
lower body and a lot of the dumbbells 

143
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,600
for time like him and I,
he,

144
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,890
he is so upset.
One time we tie,

145
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:53,500
they did a 107 reps with 75 pound 
dumbbells in five minutes on a stability

146
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,900
ball and he tied me.
Wow.

147
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,030
We both did 107 reps and he was highly 
upset.

148
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,700
He's one of the best athletes ever in 
the sport.

149
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,850
Oh no kidding.
Super Explosive.

150
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,873
Did he win the UFC heavyweight title?
I know he fought boss Rutan and I think 

151
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,333
he lost the title to Bas rutten office.
It was a real controversial decision 

152
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,080
because boss was hitting them off his 
back.

153
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,350
He broke boxes,
knows that,

154
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:22,490
right?
I'm sure.

155
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,353
Yeah,
and those breaks are pretty common 

156
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,230
habit.
Almost every fight.

157
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:27,710
Yeah.
At least some sort of bright.

158
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:31,160
Almost every fighter has like some kind 
of a DD deviated septum.

159
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,050
What you see in our fighting is down.
Mark was probably champion UFC champ,

160
00:06:35,051 --> 00:06:37,490
but fighting is changed now.
You know,

161
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,324
you know that every week you're there.
I'm only at home and in my recliner 

162
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,000
watching it,
so it's so much more sophisticated.

163
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:46,700
I love MMA because it's highly 
technical.

164
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,890
A lot of people,
you'll hear people boots still when they

165
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,480
get on the ground.
I love the ground game.

166
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,090
I love that.
Thank you.

167
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,110
Have to think.
Oh,

168
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,630
it's definitely very technical.
Well,

169
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,473
what's interesting too is that there's 
all these different approaches to 

170
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,274
strength and conditioning and that's one
of the reasons why I wanted to talk to 

171
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:01,514
you because one of the things that I had
seen was matt working out with you and 

172
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:06,800
your guys and he was doing all kinds of 
crazy stuff.

173
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,940
Like when you devise a plan,
like for an athlete,

174
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,830
like a Matte Brown or someone like that,
like what do you do?

175
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:14,664
You work with them first and try to 
figure out what they're capable of and 

176
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,970
then think about what their style is 
like.

177
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,053
Obviously you're gonna have a different,
a different need if you're a striker 

178
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,910
versus grappler.
Well one thing we do,

179
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:28,610
we try to get them where they're 
conditioned to do five minute rounds and

180
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:29,540
recovering.
One minute.

181
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,390
When I worked everything was five 
minutes and minute recovery.

182
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,220
Some guys had went through eight rounds.
A lot of guys I was able to do that.

183
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,600
I mean pretty good fighters,
you know,

184
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:41,890
13,
13 wins and and pro fights,

185
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,153
stuff like that.
So just whatever recovery I want to 

186
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,664
maximize the amount of work it can do it
five minutes and then be able to cover 

187
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:51,140
in one minute and do it again 
repeatedly.

188
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,780
That's all I ever did.
Work on five minute intervals.

189
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,763
So did you work with guys,
use heart rate monitors and how did you 

190
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,120
decide what to have done?
Any of that?

191
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,610
Really never now my print now John 
Sattler,

192
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,473
he's got Shitty Chi Jujitsu.
He's basically started almost ready to 

193
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:09,260
first MMA school in America if you think
about because he was judo,

194
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:13,340
Jujitsu Samba,
but also striking and he started in 1995

195
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,420
and he does everything by heart rate 
where we do take by percentages,

196
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,263
uh,
like said we trained by a range of 

197
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:20,840
velocity,
speed,

198
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:24,740
strength training and 75 to 85 percent.
He would do heart rates like that.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
And like if you and I would grapple 
with,

200
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,790
we could talk to each other for a half 
hour,

201
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,110
that'd be optimal.
You know,

202
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,580
me and you can talk while we're doing 
it.

203
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,470
That's an optimal heart rate that,
that way.

204
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,453
So he kept track of heart rates,
basically how we do a percentage of one 

205
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:38,054
rep Max.

206
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,103
So meaning that it's optimal if you 
could still talk while you're doing the 

207
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:45,770
extra train optimally you knew you're 
not like,

208
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:47,520
you know,
that's how I would be in here.

209
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,740
No.
So,

210
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,933
but if you're going to fight,
like if you're in a fight and it's a 

211
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:52,663
very high paced fight,
it's very likely that you're going to 

212
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:57,330
achieve much higher of heart rate would 
be much more exhausted.

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,153
But see,
that would be up to much how we train 

214
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:00,861
our speed.
Dave,

215
00:09:00,861 --> 00:09:04,140
I to today for squatting and deadlifting
is optimized.

216
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,393
They do a 25 squats at one way and two 
for speed strength acceleration into 20 

217
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,720
deadlifts and then the other days Max 
effort.

218
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,680
And that's what you're talking about,
what you go all out and around someone's

219
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,770
pushing,
you know,

220
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,480
they're trying to take you out.
So you've got to fight back.

221
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,770
So it would say it always changes.

222
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,280
You can't do the same thing.
It's called the law of accommodation few

223
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:24,170
night.
Uh,

224
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,850
if you and I grappled at the same rate 
all the time,

225
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,580
I would actually catch up to you,
you know,

226
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,750
so you'd have to be able to maximize 
your potential and run me into dirt.

227
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,450
So that's why you got to have few 
different days,

228
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,284
you know,
you can't just do the same type of work 

229
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,144
all the time.
I think that's where a lot of projects 

230
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:42,450
go wrong.
They get wordy pages up too much.

231
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,480
You see that before fighters,
fighters cover up.

232
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
And uh,
you know,

233
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:47,994
I,
I'm gonna Watch fights all my life from 

234
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,170
Roberto Duran to Mohammed Ali.
I've watched him.

235
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,920
I'm sure you've got to be a big fight 
fan and you just see how some people get

236
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:59,250
in a scheduled amount of work per 
randomly and that's when you beat them.

237
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,600
Take them out,
you know,

238
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,563
another word,
you know,

239
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,060
I'm gonna.
Make you go at my pace,

240
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:04,230
not you go,
in my opinion,

241
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,443
I'm gonna.
Go call your patient will make you feel 

242
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:06,870
it.
Mine.

243
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,940
So varying the intensity of the training
varying how you do your training.

244
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,450
You think that's very important,
very important.

245
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:13,284
Hence the change those zone.
So does it have to change all the time 

246
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,360
because the body just adapts and gets 
efficient?

247
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,194
Try that as well as ask about it.
In Law of accommodation is you adapt to 

248
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,230
a training loader stimulus and if you 
don't change it,

249
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,073
you get no better.
You actually go backwards so you can 

250
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:31,160
actually got to change these stimulus.
Tom Does a lot of stuff of war barrels.

251
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,003
We push we're bells around for half a 
mile running sometimes heavier weight 

252
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,750
walking,
get into belts.

253
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,310
Clot is very grueling.
And then just a maximal strength.

254
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,350
Went to simple things like deadlifts,
good mornings.

255
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,303
We do a lot of stuff holding the bars in
their elbows come has to do a lot of 

256
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,700
that because almost like,
you know,

257
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:50,370
grappling,
pumbling and then uh,

258
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:51,161
other times,
you know,

259
00:10:51,161 --> 00:10:53,730
you got to do quick stuff.
So quicker page stuff.

260
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,250
So,
you know,

261
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,250
it does how fights are their number one 
pace.

262
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,400
Now,
how do you create a schedule like say if

263
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:01,280
you're working with a guy and you,
you,

264
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,790
you know,
we don't believe in schedule,

265
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,140
you don't believe in it.
Now,

266
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,090
even my guys,
I had the strongest gym in the world,

267
00:11:06,091 --> 00:11:06,924
spoke about 140 all time world records 
at breakfast and time can verify at 

268
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:13,050
breakfast in the morning at 6:00,
6:30.

269
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,530
We decide what we're going to do that 
day because he drinks majored in time.

270
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,360
It's not measured in weight.
It's measured in time.

271
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,290
Talking about velocities and so we just 
pick an exercise like for you.

272
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,620
If we did a real low box squat,
didn't takes longer than squatting.

273
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,780
Eight hundred pounds.
Your gun squad a hundred pounds.

274
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,080
You know you choked me out after a 
while.

275
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:35,530
I'm gonna tap.
All right.

276
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,503
Or if we run after awhile,
I'm going to run out of oxygen and I'm 

277
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:39,960
going to quit.
Say thank for strength,

278
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,070
economic strain,
so long,

279
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,160
so long as you strained at least that 
length of time or longer,

280
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,920
you're going to break a classical lift 
and squat venture debt with.

281
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,560
I'm not totally sure I understand what 
you're saying.

282
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,830
I'm like,
why do you have different?

283
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,030
You have.
When you grapple,

284
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:56,320
you're going to have different 
opponents,

285
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,340
big ones,
small ones,

286
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,500
fast and slow ones left hand,
right hand,

287
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,700
right,
and so you,

288
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,563
you,
so you adapt to all different 

289
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:03,590
situations.
We,

290
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,390
that's what we do.

291
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,030
As long as our training is harder than a
contest,

292
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,500
we're going to break records.
I took a gentleman not long ago,

293
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,840
a 800 pound squat at one 65 top of the 
world right now,

294
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,943
1880 total top of the world,
I promise the one year old world record 

295
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,740
in less than a year,
each quarter,

296
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,260
80 pound world record until of 2008.
And we just got systematically,

297
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,600
we run everything in ways three for 
speed.

298
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,920
We work on speed,
strength,

299
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,290
exhilaration and we.
So he goes,

300
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,240
uh,
is basically 75,

301
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:32,650
80,
85 percent.

302
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,050
And then on the fourth week we way back 
and start over.

303
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:38,920
We changed the bar so that way by 
changing a safety squat bar,

304
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,020
if you know what that is,
or even a front squat,

305
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,480
we changed them link to the spine.
Um,

306
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,070
you know,
without really,

307
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,470
you know,
you only got one of the spine,

308
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,380
but we do it systematically by using 
different bars so you,

309
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,243
your brain has to now think differently 
because it's got a bar from where it 

310
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:55,720
sits on top of your back.
Your lower back is different.

311
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,240
So it has adopted that every three 
weeks.

312
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,400
So by changing bars and changing is like
the type of workouts you do,

313
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,234
it forces your body to adapt all sorts 
of different loads or all sorts of 

314
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:10,390
different ways of standing.
All sorts of different outputs.

315
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,453
We change.
Your leverage is constantly changing 

316
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,450
leverage and where the bar has to keep 
going the same,

317
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,100
you know,
like your car.

318
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:18,630
I talk about this all the time,
you know,

319
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,100
if you look at your car,
a normal car,

320
00:13:20,101 --> 00:13:23,250
it will shifts at 2,500 rpm.
So every time it shifts gears,

321
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,770
well that's optimal horsepower for that 
car.

322
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,320
And so we traded it to a certain 
percentage of the bar.

323
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:32,050
Speed is optimal for postal power.
Or if we want,

324
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,590
you know,
it's 30,

325
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,320
40 percent.
I'm like,

326
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:35,154
well,
I'm want to take you down and I'd work 

327
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:37,740
on 30 slash 40 percent,
wait til one a muscle you,

328
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,490
I've worked with 75 to 85 percent wage,
so it'd be strength speed,

329
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,790
and if I had to really grind you out,
that's why we got to make you stronger,

330
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,470
you know,
how strong grapplers are.

331
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,510
And uh,
so we work on all,

332
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,793
all different philosophies and string 
inside of one week and in where instead 

333
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:56,380
of doing high reputations,
I'm like a person Icu,

334
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,590
let's say your lower back is susceptible
to injury.

335
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,030
You might have 600 pound legs and,
but only 450 pound lower back.

336
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,710
So we work a individual muscle groups,
single joint activity like reverse hyper

337
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:10,020
works your low back hamstrings and 
spinal rectors,

338
00:14:10,021 --> 00:14:10,854
right?
We got a special machine of works to 

339
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:12,960
hamstrings.
Uh,

340
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,920
we got all these different apparatuses 
that were different parts of your body.

341
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,920
So we don't have any Muslim bounces like
MMA if you've got no stand up,

342
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:23,340
I'm going to stand up with you.
We've got no grappling.

343
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,310
I'm going to take you,
you know,

344
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,990
so wherever you said we work on all 
these witnesses have balances,

345
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:28,943
so we have constant balance of our 
strengths and abilities and we're 

346
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,680
capacity

347
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,690
and so because you don't have a schedule
and because you decide what you're going

348
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:39,100
to do that day,
do you just kind of assess like how your

349
00:14:39,101 --> 00:14:39,934
athletes are performing and what they,
what they're capable of doing given the 

350
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,950
each individual day.

351
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,820
We have records on all kinds of things 
like penn dead lifts or box deadlifts or

352
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,470
some kind of squatters,
some kind of bench.

353
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,250
They break the entire gym.
Now there's only maybe 15,

354
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,590
maybe 15 guys.
It was a private gym,

355
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,710
but you break the record over 90 percent
of the time you're in,

356
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:01,544
you're out.
So why'd you decide to have a private 

357
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:03,891
gym?
Like how come?

358
00:15:03,891 --> 00:15:05,690
How come you don't open the same 
commercial gyms?

359
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:09,470
I can't stand to be around people that 
don't know if you're a real fire.

360
00:15:09,471 --> 00:15:10,940
You don't want to be around a bunch of 
facts,

361
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,410
right?
I mean I can't stand.

362
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,520
I can't stand to go into commercial gym.
Can't stand it.

363
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,713
I just got out,
I'll leave in five minutes because 

364
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:20,240
they're not working out hard enough,
not worry,

365
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,770
not hard data on what the hell they're 
doing,

366
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,740
you know,
looking in the mirrors,

367
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,290
looking girls and shit like that.

368
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,380
I like to ask,
but,

369
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:25,841
but um,
uh,

370
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,200
gym I want to work out,
then I'll go look at that.

371
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,413
So you just decided to set up this year.
We should do like a little tour of the 

372
00:15:31,611 --> 00:15:34,160
gym at the end of the iron sharpens 
iron,

373
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,090
you know that,
right?

374
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,140
So if you're one with the,
you develop a limp.

375
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,740
So don't hang around people like this.
And how long have you had this gym for?

376
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,363
Well,
I've,

377
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,700
I've had a gym.
I started training by myself.

378
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:44,534
I had a top toe in the world,
1973 for a while until I brought my 

379
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:48,410
back.
But I've,

380
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:49,244
you know,
I've had a gym book would training 

381
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:53,170
partners since 1976.
She got my first part in 19 six.

382
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,990
It's always been private.
Is it my basement?

383
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,833
I went to my garage and we had to start 
getting bigger and bigger and bigger is 

384
00:15:58,731 --> 00:15:59,564
not better,
but we had to get bigger because we 

385
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:02,600
started to attract a lot of people that 
were good.

386
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,740
I mean they're selected to come here 
like anybody else in English,

387
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,810
so they just pay a membership fee or 
something.

388
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,770
I pay everything.
You pay everything.

389
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,560
How do you keep this place running?
This business right here.

390
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,740
Oh,
selling books and videos.

391
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,801
Machines.
I don't know.

392
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:16,634
We got um,
got like 11 or 13 patents I've paid my 

393
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:23,690
money comes from royalties from putting 
my name on different companies.

394
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,183
That's really interesting.
So it's like almost the gym itself 

395
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,510
doesn't bring any profit.
It's just reputation.

396
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,950
Probably 50 grand a year.
Wow.

397
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,720
When you say 500 years,
did gym costs me 55,000 a year.

398
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,773
Wow.
But it's one of the most respected 

399
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:44,900
places in the world.
Science and most famous gym.

400
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:46,880
There's no sign you don't need a song?
Yeah.

401
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,640
We're pulling in here.
Like where the fuck is this?

402
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,510
Twice.
That's what you like.

403
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,130
Yeah.
Wow.

404
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:53,750
That's interesting.
Well that's,

405
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,610
that's about as hardcore as it gets.

406
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,993
And it's how it would choke him into 
lovelace because a lot of people like 

407
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,520
who the fuck is,
they're not that old.

408
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,650
Back in the day,
you still power lift yourself and.

409
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,100
No,
no.

410
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,620
I had to quit five years ago.
I mean I kept up my neck,

411
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:12,410
gave out when I was 63.
I did at 7:30.

412
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:17,030
Squatting to meet 500.
Five bench six 75 to 70 when you're 63?

413
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,230
Yeah.
Wow.

414
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,890
My neck just gave out wide.
Starting to pass out all the time zone.

415
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,440
You start passing out all the time 
because of my neck.

416
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,410
Like what's going on and to compress 
this.

417
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,563
What?
Yeah,

418
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,790
totally.
It's the basically from my mid back,

419
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:29,923
from my deck to my mid back is like 
locked up all just from carrying heavy 

420
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:34,960
weight,
heavy squats and heavier.

421
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,880
I was squatting for 10 when I was 14 
years old for 10.

422
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,570
At 14 to 16 to content support.
Keen at 1:40.

423
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,640
Wow.
It hold new.

424
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,890
60.
I'll be 69 in two weeks.

425
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,320
But.
So how old were you when you were saying

426
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,890
that you lifted all that weight?
The law,

427
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,590
the most recent 63,
63 and that's when you done,

428
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,463
you're like,
that's enough.

429
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,083
I was passing out and you know,
I couldn't pass out and I came off a 

430
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,840
platform and I expect for him was 
described good.

431
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,000
It was 7:35 and he said No.
I said,

432
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:03,791
what was wrong?
He said,

433
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,530
you pass out.
I mean,

434
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,480
I didn't know.
Then I was on Queer Street,

435
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:10,830
I noticed as real dark covered.
So when I went I made it through.

436
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:15,810
That meant I needed to get an 1885 total
is actually 37th in the world that year.

437
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,070
Wow.
And then,

438
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:17,904
uh,
I mean I thought I could actually tell 

439
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,380
what 2000 pounds if I,
I was doing training which was squatting

440
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,790
the age,
but,

441
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,650
but because it needs context,
you were geared,

442
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:26,760
it takes longer to get up and down.

443
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,920
Just caused me to pass out.
Now.

444
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,030
Have you ever thought about inventing 
something that would strengthen the rest

445
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:35,340
of respond the same way you did the 
reverse hyper?

446
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,640
I wish because I've got two devices.
It definitely worked for the lower spine

447
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,590
that I,
I need something from upper right now.

448
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:44,424
Um,
I just went through a series of stem 

449
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,160
cell.
I don't know what you got.

450
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:51,600
You get stem cell stem cell in my knee,
both hips and my shoulder and.

451
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:56,100
Right and I just yesterday had platelet 
injections in my knee and my hip.

452
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,180
You got to go back next week,
but I'm not,

453
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,450
I get nerve blocks in my neck,
you know,

454
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,373
I'd love to get my neck well,
but I think my also got kicked in my 

455
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,270
leg,
uh,

456
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,870
by a kid.
A fight or a small one.

457
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,930
One 35 and he screwed up by.
Nice.

458
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,010
So that didn't help me any.
Why did he kick you in the leg?

459
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,650
But I told him to kick me in the head.
She didn't kick me,

460
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,820
don't kick me in and he kicked me to 
nene.

461
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,430
Torn muscle in basically must be,
or a hamstring right above my knee.

462
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,090
Will you guys sparring or something?
Yeah.

463
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,133
Oh,
okay.

464
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,201
Yeah.
I'm just stupid.

465
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:24,920
Like dude.
So he's still spar?

466
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,460
No,
no,

467
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,293
no,
no,

468
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,970
no.
I keep.

469
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,320
I can barely get around now.
I had a fracture is called 13 guy hit me

470
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,760
in a hipaa baseball,
13,

471
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,490
10,
broken jaw and broken hand by 18.

472
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,430
You know,
you didn't have him in me back then.

473
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,773
Have you thought about inventing 
something that would have strengthened 

474
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,633
the cervical spine and linkedin?
Know I got on a boat of things I just 

475
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:50,220
said we're gonna.
We're going to introduce the machine.

476
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,540
October 21st going to absolutely change 
of strength training as world knows.

477
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,030
It's called a static dynamic of Elbert.
It will change.

478
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,090
The world is static dynamic developer.
What is that going to do?

479
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,163
Well,
it's like if I hold elbow and a get 

480
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,733
pressure on your arm and go in,
I have a machine that's going to hold 

481
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:08,610
you like throw a punch.
Hold it,

482
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,950
let it go.
Buy Button.

483
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,620
Hm?
I'm not sure.

484
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm just watching you.
You do a a judo.

485
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,540
You ever see judo toss where a guy,
they'll tell you in crash pad,

486
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,210
like one for.
Well,

487
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,380
we'll hold you down while the other guy 
tries to throw.

488
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:23,280
Then the guy,
let's go.

489
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,870
Yes.
Same thing.

490
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:25,790
Just like that.
What?

491
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,600
I mean,
I have a machine that could do that.

492
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,420
Oh,
interesting.

493
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,060
So you could pull like as hard as you 
can and can't budge.

494
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:37,740
Me and I released zooming.
Is it possible to develop something like

495
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:40,410
a reverse hyper that works on some sort 
of a neck brace?

496
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,633
Like a similar type of movement?
We've done reverse hypers with NEC 

497
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,200
harnesses.
Yeah.

498
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,540
Where you're working in the top of your 
spine to the very bottom of your spine.

499
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,303
Hm.

500
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,373
Now how would that.
So you would do the reverse hyper with 

501
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,100
which to people are just listening to 
this.

502
00:20:57,101 --> 00:21:00,040
What a reverse hyper is,
is like say a table.

503
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,083
If you put your upper body on a table 
and your lower body was suspended 

504
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,700
underneath the table,
like hanging underneath the table,

505
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,940
you would attach your ankles to this 
harness.

506
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:10,774
That's like a leg curl attachment and 
you lift your legs up straight and then 

507
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:17,740
when you let your legs down it's pulling
on your spine.

508
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,300
So it's active

509
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,463
pressure.
Right?

510
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,680
And what would you do with your neck?
I've put it,

511
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,900
we use it,
but put a neck,

512
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:26,740
arm or song.
So when you're down,

513
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,970
when,
when you raised that,

514
00:21:27,971 --> 00:21:31,330
when you raise your feet,
we also read your upper body and then so

515
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,164
when we do have to use at neck harness,
you're working the very top of your 

516
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:38,300
spine right up to the atlas all the way 
down to six.

517
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:38,880
So

518
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,660
would it be a neck harness?
Like with weights on it?

519
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,610
Yes.
Okay.

520
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:42,444
So just like a regular neck harness,
like where you hang your weights down 

521
00:21:44,841 --> 00:21:45,620
and you do it.

522
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,120
Yeah.
So when you pick up your feet,

523
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:48,450
you pick up your head as well.
You,

524
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,420
you rub it down,
back and forth.

525
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,510
That's interesting.
Huh?

526
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,710
That seems like a great idea.
Thanks Joe.

527
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,903
Yeah,
I bet you do.

528
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,753
Well,
you mean as soon as I saw that reverse 

529
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:00,650
hyper machine,
I was like,

530
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,040
well how come this isn't used constantly
because it totally makes sense.

531
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,200
It's Trenton's the back and a very 
strange way.

532
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,053
Like I brought in a bunch of people that
have had back issues and they just try 

533
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:12,230
it once and then go,
whoa.

534
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:12,801
I'm like,
yeah,

535
00:22:12,801 --> 00:22:14,510
why the fuck is this thing?
Not Everywhere.

536
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,510
It's marketing.
You know Tom Barry here.

537
00:22:17,511 --> 00:22:19,100
Does one marketing,
but you know,

538
00:22:19,101 --> 00:22:20,770
we're just starting and I never tried to
market.

539
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,460
I didn't care.
I didn't care about my business,

540
00:22:22,461 --> 00:22:25,700
cared about my gym now he cared about my
gym on my life.

541
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,740
It's one of the most,
it's one of the most common injuries for

542
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:31,870
people who lift weights or for people 
who grapple,

543
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,093
like I know a lot of fighters who have 
either have had diskectomy where they 

544
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:40,450
take a chunk out of your disk or they're
getting disc replacements.

545
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:41,284
Now a lot of guys are getting 
displacements because it develops a 

546
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,403
pretty new technology in Europe where 
they have these articulating titanium 

547
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:47,914
disks and they just cut out all the 
gelatinous substance between the discs 

548
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:52,354
and they put this articulating 
mechanical disc in there and guys were 

549
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:57,220
getting great relief and they're able to
start fighting again.

550
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,250
I know rick story has to have them in 
his neck.

551
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,630
Um,
uh,

552
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,920
quite a few guys have had these things 
done where there their back was just too

553
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:07,540
fucked up and they just couldn't do 
anything.

554
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:09,640
It's another actually replacing disks.
Yeah,

555
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,030
that's what happened to me.
But with you,

556
00:23:12,031 --> 00:23:13,230
they wanted a fuse.
You right.

557
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,880
I had two doctors,
2005 but would not pregnant on me.

558
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,990
She says she dangerous.
That was 11 years ago.

559
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,520
Why too dangerous?
I don't know.

560
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:22,100
Is that Ohio state do you sent me to,
to,

561
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,150
to search into Ohio state and he 
wouldn't operate on me.

562
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,550
And you wonder why it was because I was 
taking,

563
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:29,520
I was living on Nyquil and tylenol pm.

564
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,680
So it was too dangerous because you were
taking so many pain pills?

565
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,000
No,
they said it was at that time there,

566
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:36,834
the procedures they had,
they thought it was more dangerous not 

567
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:40,114
to operate on me then leave me alone.
But I mean they weren't going through 

568
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,530
me.
I've been trached.

569
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:45,740
I've had chest tubes.
I have a thoracic outlet.

570
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,940
What do my doctor here in town?
Outlet threat cutlets with.

571
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:50,774
A lot of people have open heart surgery.
So you can't put your hands over your 

572
00:23:52,881 --> 00:23:54,280
head anymore.
Um,

573
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,183
I went to my doctor.
He had me put my hand over my head and 

574
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:58,364
raise my head and my pulse stopped 
because it basically goes in and touch 

575
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:03,840
his carotid artery.
Why it stopped my.

576
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,693
Yes,
so when you would raise your hands over 

577
00:24:07,251 --> 00:24:09,820
your head,
it would compress your carotid artery.

578
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,113
What's causing it to do that?
Because it would push whatever is doing 

579
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:16,510
and would just cut the oxygen.

580
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,673
See if I.
If you want to tap me out and just puts 

581
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,250
her head backwards and I'll go to sleep 
for you.

582
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,470
Sounds like head backwards anymore.
Powerlifting sounds fucking terrible for

583
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,230
you.
Like you know,

584
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,040
if you had grappled guys,
wait one second.

585
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:33,380
You all your life.
I grabbed hold of guys away to 2,920.

586
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,110
Well not exactly what it's like,
right?

587
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,450
Yeah.
You know when you want to unlimited turn

588
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,440
tournament and you get some 285 pound 
monster on your hands.

589
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,900
Same thing to get bigger and bigger.
It's A.

590
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,430
You're burning the candle at both ends.
So you know the weights each Sheila,

591
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,130
but you don't sound like you have any 
regrets whatsoever.

592
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:52,190
I don't regret if I hadn't been beat up 
and all my life.

593
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,140
I've never learned what I learned.
You know,

594
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:55,340
people make fun of me is.
Oh,

595
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:57,280
you broke your back in 70 through your 
broker math.

596
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:57,891
Well,
you know,

597
00:24:57,891 --> 00:24:59,700
I have no bicep.
Tore my bicep off.

598
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,730
$70 towards this and off a knotted up 
right here.

599
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,710
That's where the bicep ties into your 
forum.

600
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,980
So both your biceps had been torn off 
and it never stopped me.

601
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,843
I told this and I'll totally.
And they told me I was done six months 

602
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:14,570
later,
won a national championship.

603
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,640
Third biggest total estimate.
Pulled that.

604
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,280
Let me see what that looks like again.
So it's gone.

605
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,810
It's gone.
You have no bicep?

606
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,850
No right here.
So that's insane.

607
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,680
So you don't do curls it very few curls.
Curls don't matter for us.

608
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,150
Curls for the girls,
Sandra.

609
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,900
It's all extensions.
Extension.

610
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,620
Wow.
But that's how I learned.

611
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:34,610
You know,
how you going to learn.

612
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,683
So when you tour it,
you didn't even think about getting 

613
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:37,454
surgery to get a return.
I went to three surgeons to set 

614
00:25:39,111 --> 00:25:39,890
operating one second.

615
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:41,210
You don't care what it looks like,
don't operate.

616
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:43,520
And I said I'm not operating.
Wow.

617
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,850
No,
I said six months.

618
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:45,684
So they are made to third highest over,
made my way clients and then you had to 

619
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:50,330
fuck up the other one I don't believe or
not,

620
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,310
but I told them my patella tendon and 
half,

621
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,850
I'd never done curls like you said.
Yeah.

622
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,030
Richard enhance many catheters over 
here.

623
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,350
So I,
uh,

624
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,850
I was doing curls and then talking about
freaking payslip and Jim,

625
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,990
I'm so bored I couldn't hardly do 
anything.

626
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,390
So you were so bored because he tore 
your mortality.

627
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:10,040
Say,
well let me try these curls and then you

628
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:12,460
want to blow in your bicep.
I Petroleum,

629
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,440
I took Patel.
I was never going to let the kid because

630
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:15,274
I was 43 at that point and I'd done 
about everything that I was going to do 

631
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,000
a.

632
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,670
and then,
uh,

633
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,503
so like four years later I had a kid who
was training me these world record 

634
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,640
holder at 20 years old in the bank,
seven,

635
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:26,600
28.
And I told him,

636
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:27,434
I says,
Kenny.

637
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,221
I said,
man,

638
00:26:28,221 --> 00:26:31,070
I've got my retirement is caught seven 
for you ever been seven again.

639
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:31,940
He said,
old man,

640
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,980
you don't interrupt several pounds on 
your back again.

641
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:38,340
I brought me every time I write a seven 
eights and nines I squat,

642
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:40,910
I have a second biggest squat in the 
world at 50 years old,

643
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,980
at the fourth biggest total assist 
because brought it up

644
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,390
to you like,
hey,

645
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,930
you run your.
Run your mouth.

646
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,900
You know,
the good thing was he made me.

647
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,450
He made me do that,
but he never did break at bench record,

648
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,420
so I'm always thankful for.
I'm very motivated by anything and get a

649
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,900
highly motivated person.

650
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,150
Now you've also been real open about 
steroids,

651
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,323
which I think is very commendable 
because it's one of those things in the 

652
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:09,574
world of power lifting the world of 
bodybuilding and even in the world of 

653
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:13,570
fighting,
it's a dirty,

654
00:27:13,571 --> 00:27:16,720
dark secret that people like to keep to 
themselves,

655
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,090
but your grandpa can take it.

656
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:19,770
Yeah,
yeah.

657
00:27:19,771 --> 00:27:20,604
Right.
Yeah.

658
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,180
I,
I believe in my,

659
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,740
in my opinion,
there should be.

660
00:27:23,741 --> 00:27:26,650
You should pass the physical.
No one has the right to tell you what to

661
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:27,484
do in this world.
When it comes time to die on the one 

662
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:32,200
that's got a di,
someone's time for me to live letting me

663
00:27:32,201 --> 00:27:33,400
lead to life.
I want to live,

664
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:34,803
but what do you think in terms of the 
problem with a lot of people have the 

665
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:43,060
problem,
the problem they see with using steroids

666
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:43,894
in sports is it's going to force young 
people to use steroids to be able to 

667
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,970
compete with the people that are using 
them and do it anyhow.

668
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,343
Yeah.
But if everybody's forced to be cleaned 

669
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:54,660
and they don't like what we're doing now
with the UFC,

670
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:58,660
you were like the Usada the,
the people that have stepped in and Jeff

671
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,510
Novitsky running that program.
The guy who caught Lance Armstrong.

672
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,550
Well actually,
Lance Armstrong was never caught,

673
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:05,384
right?
He passed.

674
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,090
He passed 25 tests for seven years in a 
row.

675
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,740
I never was tested.
See,

676
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:11,330
it's not against the rules to take 
drugs.

677
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,880
It's against the rules.
You get caught taking drugs.

678
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,390
That's a fucking loophole.

679
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,880
You got a good doctor.
You're on the craft or not.

680
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:22,950
Not.
So that's why there should be no,

681
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,000
uh,
uh,

682
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,710
Tyson period said an even playing field 
stop the drug test.

683
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,960
I'd say the same thing.
Not Old Barn was seeing my testosterone.

684
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:31,890
That's true.
I mean,

685
00:28:31,891 --> 00:28:34,830
when I was a kid,
even if I was born today,

686
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:35,664
I would be in prison.
You're not telling me to teach all 

687
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,390
these,
you know,

688
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,780
some of those fighters have got way more
testosterone than another fighter.

689
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:44,160
That's true.
Not Born at same amount.

690
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,740
So the only thing you could,
why not train?

691
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,750
You got a better.
If you got a better,

692
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:49,301
uh,
you know,

693
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:52,920
if you could kick my ass because you do 
Jujitsu and shit and I don't do any,

694
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,450
but that don't mean you're tougher than 
me.

695
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,190
I just means you got a better coach in 
me.

696
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,960
So are you cheating me?

697
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,330
That's a good point.
But if two guys do have the same coaches

698
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:07,290
and they do have similar body types and 
one guy's taking steroids,

699
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,850
he's going to have an advantage.
Right?

700
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,870
But isn't at pharmaceutical.
What are you looking at?

701
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,890
Watch TV every five minutes.
You go to a drug commercial one.

702
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,600
Every year I'll be 69.
Let's take all the god,

703
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,210
I'm 68.
I'll be 600 to let's take all the health

704
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:23,830
medication off.
Six to eight year olds.

705
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,410
I'll be the only one left on her.
I don't have any ailments.

706
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,880
Tom will tell you my problem is they go 
to the doctor does note some Romaine.

707
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:30,723
There's nothing wrong with me.
I just beat the crap out of myself 

708
00:29:32,501 --> 00:29:34,840
physically.
I don't have high blood pressure,

709
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:35,674
high cholesterol,
I don't have anything and so let's just 

710
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:39,184
take all the drugs away.
But all the old 68 year old guys off is 

711
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,823
well.
Well be the only one lit for a guy like 

712
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,283
all the old women.

713
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,510
Well,
for a guy like you who's not competing,

714
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:51,344
and was he one of the arguments for 
fighting is that steroids allow you to 

715
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:55,974
do more damage to your opponent and that
that is one of the reasons why steroids 

716
00:30:00,241 --> 00:30:03,150
should be illegal is because you can 
train harder,

717
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:04,950
you have more endurance and not just 
steroids,

718
00:30:04,951 --> 00:30:07,320
but things like epo and bunch of other 
stuff.

719
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:10,710
You'll have more energy in a fight.
You could possibly land more blows,

720
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,753
possibly wind up beating someone that 
you wouldn't be able to beat and do 

721
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:17,430
damage to them.
So it's different a lot of ways,

722
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,783
but why?
Why wouldn't person take us force for 

723
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:20,920
him,
you know,

724
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,010
is called PDDS performance enhancing 
drugs.

725
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,680
Why wouldn't you do that in sports?
Well,

726
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,573
his.
Because they would think of it as 

727
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:29,411
cheating.
Well,

728
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:30,880
who does?
Well,

729
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:33,550
a lot of people don't know how many guys
are cry their eyes out,

730
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,200
but get caught.
Then he cried like bitches and a lie.

731
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,840
Right?
Baseball players,

732
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,220
they don't.
They never took drugs.

733
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:41,920
You get caught in a car like bitches.
That's what I don't like.

734
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:43,630
Just tell them.
I'll tell you,

735
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:44,464
I'll never read the Bible,
but see the billboards on the freeway 

736
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,040
says,
I shall not lie.

737
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,560
Just quit line and come out and say I'd 
take droids you know the NFL.

738
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,210
Why would you be in this for like the 
NFL?

739
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,040
You know,
what drugs do is for recovery.

740
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,780
That's all it is.
You know,

741
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,230
you take.

742
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,570
I can give my strongest people I've ever
seen doing.

743
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:05,910
I've seen guys take board drugs than 
anyone I've ever had much.

744
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,380
Really?
Yeah.

745
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:10,540
Jugs up make you strong.
You're born that way.

746
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:12,220
You're born Fascia,
born slow.

747
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,920
You're born with an attitude or you're 
not.

748
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,863
Well,
that's the big misconception about 

749
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:18,580
steroids,
right?

750
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,310
Is that they make you bigger.
The work makes you bigger,

751
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,160
is to recovery,
cause you to recover,

752
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:25,610
to do more workouts.
Right?

753
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:28,810
So everyone doesn't want to do workouts.
How did the people,

754
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,940
you know,
save you want to be an MMA fighter,

755
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,940
intimidated in a cage one time and never
get by.

756
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:34,774
Coleman told me,
Mark said he had a million restaurants 

757
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:39,160
when he had hammer house here.
Soon as they got onboard one time,

758
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:40,150
but he never came back.

759
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,313
But there's,
there's a mild benefit to taking 

760
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:47,460
testosterone,
a bunch of other stuff without doing any

761
00:31:47,461 --> 00:31:50,160
physical work.
But almost all of it is in the fact that

762
00:31:50,161 --> 00:31:50,980
you could put in or

763
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,470
work and you recover far quicker than 
the average person.

764
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,990
Yeah.
But see that way if everyone took it,

765
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,490
you're not cheating.
You know,

766
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,480
you don't,
you gotTa,

767
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,890
you gotTa,
you got a corvette,

768
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,753
you don't have to put high test cats in.
Don't you think that like it also for 

769
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,024
young guys,
you can fuck up your endocrine system 

770
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:10,530
and fucks up your body's production 
testosterone.

771
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,100
So what?
So that's what hcg sport,

772
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,660
you got to spark doc,
you take her.

773
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,470
Everybody takes hcg because your muscles
shrink up because if you take roids,

774
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,110
you take tests,
you're taking more in mother nature told

775
00:32:23,111 --> 00:32:23,944
you so you're not measuring cup,
but there are morons anyhow because you 

776
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,390
took act,
you're nuts.

777
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,263
Wouldn't drink up HCG.
What does that stand for in tropic 

778
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,624
hormone?
It raises all your home men's vendors 

779
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,770
and sports there.
You cannot.

780
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:40,010
There's no sportsmanship in sports.
It mean you were still fight in

781
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,280
front of a big crowd.
Half the crowd will want me to knock you

782
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:44,114
out.
And the other half the crowd would want 

783
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:46,700
you to knock me out.
Is that sportsmanship?

784
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,460
Well,
that's just people.

785
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,050
Sportsmanship is supposed to be the 
athletes competing without cheating.

786
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,153
I mean if,
if,

787
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,100
if there was a pill that you could take 
that made you invulnerable,

788
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,953
gave you like a God pill and you took 
anyone into a fight and the other guy 

789
00:33:01,371 --> 00:33:02,840
thought he was fighting a man,
but you're,

790
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,820
you're invulnerable.
No one can hurt you.

791
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,440
You can't be hurt and you don't get 
tired,

792
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,170
which you have superhuman strength.
That's a good point.

793
00:33:09,171 --> 00:33:11,300
With share Roy still be legal or illegal
type point.

794
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,700
Well,
it would be better than steroids.

795
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,870
It would.
It would be like a superstar Roy,

796
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,723
but I mean,
wouldn't you think that that would be 

797
00:33:17,391 --> 00:33:18,310
cheating?
No,

798
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,460
no,
no,

799
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,100
but we'll then nobody can beat anybody.

800
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,410
You just beat the fuck out of each other
and nothing would ever happen.

801
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,940
But in the hills right here,
it all starts up in your brain,

802
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:26,991
man.
See,

803
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:30,860
I kind of could see how you can make 
that argument with other sports,

804
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:35,090
but fighting.
I mean fighting is about fighting.

805
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:38,090
Is problem solving with dire physical 
consequences.

806
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:38,924
I mean that's what it is and if you can 
minimize those consequences through 

807
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:43,064
drugs,
a lot of people would think that would 

808
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,760
be cheating.
I look at this,

809
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,703
I look at the Diaz brothers.
I'm guessing they got a lot of 

810
00:33:50,271 --> 00:33:51,104
testosterone.
I don't know who in the hell their dad 

811
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,850
was,
but he must have a lot of testosterone.

812
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:55,740
Well,
it's interesting.

813
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,370
Those guys eat Vegan for the most part 
thing.

814
00:33:58,371 --> 00:33:59,204
Nate eats fish and eggs to.
I don't even know if Nicki's fish it 

815
00:34:02,831 --> 00:34:04,880
might have in the past,
but I don't think he does anymore.

816
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,713
I think he's pretty much Vegan,
which most people that eat vegan have 

817
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:09,944
lower testosterone because the substrate
for developing testosterone is fats is 

818
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,410
like cholesterol and fans and one of the
most important.

819
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:20,300
It's.
It's like when people get on ketogenetic

820
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,193
diets,
one of the more interesting things that 

821
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:22,844
happens when they consume a large amount
of fats and saturated fats and 

822
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:30,491
cholesterol is that their testosterone 
goes way up to high cholesterol diet.

823
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,780
Yes.
So I don't.

824
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,300
I don't necessarily know if those guys 
have high testosterone.

825
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:38,240
What they do have is high endurance 
endurance is through the roof,

826
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,940
but a lot of that is because they 
participate in triathlons,

827
00:34:40,941 --> 00:34:42,830
a lot of endurance running endurance,
swimming,

828
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,120
biking,
things along those lines.

829
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,980
So it's.
You still have to have the brain thought

830
00:34:48,981 --> 00:34:50,490
to go kick someone's ass.
Right,

831
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:53,240
but don't you think that Ronda Rousey 
has that brain thought to.

832
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,850
She doesn't have any testosterone but 
makes.

833
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,720
She has some but not a lot.
You know what I mean?

834
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,800
But more than other girls have,
but not more than about Cyborg.

835
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,460
Well,
that's a little different.

836
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,040
Well see that's the argument for 
steroids right there.

837
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,770
That's the argument because she actually
has been caught,

838
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:10,280
but she's actually tested positive and 
she's passionate test now,

839
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,840
right?
Yes.

840
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,674
But you know as well as I do that when a
woman takes male hormones for a long 

841
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,160
period of time,
even if they get off of them,

842
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,730
there's benefits that they keep forever.
Same thing with men.

843
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,010
Yes.
And just because you're passing the drug

844
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:26,570
test,
I won't say who,

845
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,060
but I trained the top international shot
putter.

846
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,670
He could go off and apart and eight days
pass a drug test,

847
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,980
IOC said.
I will say say that's it.

848
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,993
It's only eight days.
You can get onto the Nana par se 

849
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,980
antibodies,
one of the quickest ones to get

850
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,430
off of.
Right?

851
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,430
Yeah.
So I mean you.

852
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,540
I mean how I forget to take stuff for 
eight days.

853
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,440
So the benefits unquestionably are 
permanent or at least some of them are.

854
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,680
What I think about,
you know,

855
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:51,514
what you're looking at.
You're looking at a fight and career as 

856
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:56,410
you see it in an envelope and then when 
that day that tough part retires,

857
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,273
you forget about it,
but what about the years later after a 

858
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,410
fighter's career,
if he was on antibiotics,

859
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,850
he would survive the fighting years and 
be able to continue with his older years

860
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:07,684
like me.

861
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:12,260
So what you're saying is that listening?
Well,

862
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:15,440
longevity post career,
I totally understand that.

863
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:18,230
A lot of fighters believed that as well,
like testosterone replacement,

864
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:21,470
growth hormone therapy for guys who have
retired,

865
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,453
but while they're competing themselves,
they don't want to do anything because 

866
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:25,724
they don't want to think that the reason
why they accomplish those goals because 

867
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:28,424
they were taking drugs.
I could shoot tons of Roy and so much 

868
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:35,630
that I think will make them kick my ass.
It's not gonna make them kick their ass,

869
00:36:35,631 --> 00:36:36,464
but there's no question that some 
fighters fight better when they're 

870
00:36:38,901 --> 00:36:42,200
taking steroids.
How about just a nutritionist?

871
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,200
Let's just cut out the nutritionist.
Yeah,

872
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:46,580
but the nutritionist.
Look,

873
00:36:46,581 --> 00:36:48,290
look,
everybody knows how to eat healthy.

874
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,393
I mean,
if you're eating healthy and you're 

875
00:36:50,301 --> 00:36:51,134
training hard,
but one guy's taking steroids and one 

876
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:54,104
guy's not,
there's a giant advantage with the guy 

877
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,033
was taking steroids.
I just know too many people take 

878
00:36:57,741 --> 00:37:00,440
steroids and then the passenger test.
That's all I'm trying to say.

879
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,000
Right.
Well that bring up any names.

880
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,863
I understand and I know you're not,
but that's one of the reasons why the 

881
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:08,810
UFC is instituted this incredibly 
invasive.

882
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:12,260
You sought a policy where they don't 
wake you up at 6:30 in the morning.

883
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,550
Well,
how'd you like that?

884
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,250
Watching piss in a cup.
I don't like it exactly,

885
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:17,960
but that's the only way to catch people.

886
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,230
I just.
I'll never go into a drug test.

887
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,470
I don't think the NFL,
she had drug tests intro.

888
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,700
I think there's a good argument there.
First of all,

889
00:37:27,701 --> 00:37:29,500
it's a good argument for baseball 
because baseball,

890
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:30,334
no one's getting hurt in the NFL.
You could make the argument that you're 

891
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,054
able to hurt guys more and then that 
damages them and it shortens their 

892
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:37,504
career,
but.

893
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,640
But baseball does no argument,
in my opinion.

894
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,750
Baseball's boring as fuck.
And if,

895
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,080
I mean some people like it,
I get it,

896
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,093
but what I'm saying is like if you got a
drug that lets you hit more balls over 

897
00:37:48,731 --> 00:37:50,140
the fence,
take that.

898
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,970
That's the only thing interesting about.

899
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,730
So how do you let that sport get away 
with it?

900
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,780
You know what I'm saying?
Why not make it legal for all,

901
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,820
you know,
like baseball's a funny thing.

902
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,550
You know,
if you hit less than 50 home runs,

903
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:03,384
I guess your drug free,
but you start hitting 51 year old roy 

904
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,050
dry.
It seemed like as what this core.

905
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,923
And he talked about the base,
the steroid here [inaudible] we're 

906
00:38:09,911 --> 00:38:12,960
taking a drug to 19 sixties who they 
trying the kid where they.

907
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,260
Yeah,
in St Louis,

908
00:38:14,261 --> 00:38:15,940
you know,
a football team.

909
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,781
Um,
you know,

910
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:17,880
the raiders.
Uh,

911
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,650
I've heard stories where I think it's 
documented on espn.

912
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:23,800
Never gone in and had the ball tabs on 
the training table.

913
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,920
Alright,
well,

914
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,320
you know what I say to the raiders or 
the baseball team,

915
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:30,820
the oral,
the um,

916
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,670
the aes athletics.
What was like,

917
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,533
if they're in the same town,
you sign these 200 and sexual 

918
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,680
wondergirls room section about the 
girls.

919
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,693
What if no one has it?
They knew football players were taking 

920
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:49,900
it in in Oakland,
but why wasn't,

921
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,900
why wouldn't the baseball player if you 
taken it right down the street.

922
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,900
The other problem was what do you think 
that people were thinking of steroids as

923
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:57,890
being,
uh,

924
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,410
like that kind of power being a crucial 
aspect of baseball.

925
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,790
But I think what it was.
Sure.

926
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,870
But baseball is more of a skill game,
don't you think?

927
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,530
Did anyone ever tests Mickey Mantle?
Roger Maris,

928
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,590
Hank Aaron,
you think Hank Aaron was doing steroids.

929
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,500
They had steroids back then.
Shirts 19,

930
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,334
39.
But where people were athletes taking 

931
00:39:15,081 --> 00:39:15,914
them?
No,

932
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,380
exactly.
Yes.

933
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,240
That's what I'm trying to say.
Get the football team was taking it.

934
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,223
Why wouldn't a principal.
So we'll get these fortunate result 

935
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,201
geeks.
Anyhow,

936
00:39:24,201 --> 00:39:25,820
they interviewed the goddamn thing in 
her life,

937
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,193
but they're also a hypocritical and they
got these ideas and they're popping on 

938
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
air.
Probably taken a,

939
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,190
you know,
a testosterone therapy as it is.

940
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,660
I was that apparently one time and his 
doctors are big fat guy and he's talking

941
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:42,080
about how bad boy josh does listen to 
them and then like for instance,

942
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,220
what's a patch on here?
He says,

943
00:39:43,221 --> 00:39:44,420
well,
that's a testosterone patch.

944
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,690
What kind of thinking is that?
It's a true story.

945
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,160
Well,
there's a lot of hypocritical.

946
00:39:52,161 --> 00:39:54,020
Thank you.
When it comes to that stuff for sure.

947
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,100
It's just,
it's,

948
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:55,933
it's an interesting debate and a lot of 
people think that you should be able to 

949
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,354
do whatever you want,
like the pride days during the pride 

950
00:40:02,271 --> 00:40:04,520
days,
which in my opinion are some of the most

951
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,790
exciting all time,
mixed martial arts fights.

952
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,893
Those guys did whatever the fuck they 
wanted and the Japanese literally told 

953
00:40:12,501 --> 00:40:15,770
them like in their contract we will not 
test you for steroids.

954
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:16,670
They told them that

955
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,040
hell at horse racing.
Dog Racing.

956
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,130
Yeah.
But everybody that's okay.

957
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,550
And he just worry about that.

958
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,780
Well,
echo poise,

959
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,020
poise is equity.
It's got a horse in the fucking title.

960
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:30,980
Yeah.
I mean,

961
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:34,280
and that's something that people take 
and it's a hormone for steroids,

962
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:36,590
for,
for horses now.

963
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,810
So you don't think there's anything 
negative with.

964
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,730
There's obviously got to be some 
drawbacks of steroids,

965
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:44,564
right?

966
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,130
I went on antibiotics 19 January 1970,
1970,

967
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,420
1970.
And uh,

968
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,000
so what was this?
Two Thousand 16?

969
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,320
Yeah,
I'd never been off.

970
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,480
You never been off in 46 years.
That's insane.

971
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,640
Just stay on them.
I try no cycle in that.

972
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:08,070
Go off to tell everybody you're off.

973
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,320
I get sad.
I go out there and tell the truth.

974
00:41:12,321 --> 00:41:15,680
I don't lie to people get upset at you 
that you're so honest about it.

975
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,340
I don't give a damn of the upset of 
course,

976
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,223
but I'm just curious if you ever come up
at the council of self respect and I 

977
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:23,720
give him hell about these geeks.
They're not doing crap.

978
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,093
They suck when they were kids.
They suck when you're middle age and 

979
00:41:26,801 --> 00:41:27,640
they suck when you're old.

980
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,120
That's how I look at our day in prison.
I'll be on Roy John Little country road.

981
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:38,963
You wouldn't be putting our world 
wouldn't be in shape us in the day if 

982
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:44,840
they had some nuts,
but if they had not stayed,

983
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:45,860
wouldn't need steroids.
Right?

984
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:50,861
Because then let's say some aggression,
some aggression.

985
00:41:51,111 --> 00:41:51,944
Yeah,
so my friend was a psychologist and he 

986
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:56,960
would test people in prisons,
rapists and murderers.

987
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:57,794
He said he had tested some,
had 25 times the rate testosterone's 

988
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:05,540
normal man does 25 one time.
That's why I say,

989
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,280
you know,
it wasn't even possible.

990
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:08,283
Well why are they out there raping 
people and why they killing people with 

991
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:11,714
no,
no remorse because he got an enormous 

992
00:42:13,971 --> 00:42:15,890
amount.
He said that he saw.

993
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,720
That's why they probably did it.
He didn't,

994
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,870
you know,
if you can't do that stuff,

995
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,704
he realized that.
But he thought that's why they will be 

996
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,440
on a course to do stuff like that.

997
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:27,440
It was just absolutely crazy.
You take a look at elephant.

998
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,600
These elephants a well they call it when
they.

999
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,730
It just ease.
I'll test house on route,

1000
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,400
killing each other and knock it down.
Villagers and everything.

1001
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,270
So the world needs more of that.
Well,

1002
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,770
I think it needs more because of the 
look at the.

1003
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,520
You know what,
when I was a kid,

1004
00:42:40,521 --> 00:42:42,710
just 10 percent gay.
Now they say there's 34,

1005
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,360
34 percent,
four percent fluxes that.

1006
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,760
But college is good.
I believe it.

1007
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:54,390
Boy Bands.
There's no ways.

1008
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,150
Thirty four percent.
Four percent.

1009
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,620
Oh Man.
Okay.

1010
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,840
Well I'm sure some would test out.
Terrific.

1011
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:01,580
I look at Jeffrey Dahmer and he's out 
there killing people.

1012
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,843
Well,
he was gay too.

1013
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:04,723
Yeah,
that's it.

1014
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,093
But I don't think.
I don't necessarily think that's a 

1015
00:43:07,311 --> 00:43:08,540
testosterone thing.
Right?

1016
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,000
That's a sociopath psychopath thing.
Who knows?

1017
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,500
I will say that.
Well,

1018
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:13,190
I don't think.

1019
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,470
Well,
I'm not talking about the gay part.

1020
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,850
The other part we're eating people.
Yeah.

1021
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,140
Yes.
I mean that.

1022
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,223
But that's.
But that's not a good argument for 

1023
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:25,400
testosterone if you're seeing the 
prisoners and rapists and murderers have

1024
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:26,234
a lot of it.
So everybody has got a lot of opinions 

1025
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:30,380
about Roy's,
but I've seen probably a thousand people

1026
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,810
on Roy's over the years.
Right?

1027
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:32,400
Okay.
No,

1028
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,231
maybe more.
Right?

1029
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:34,064
That's right.
The ones who took the most drugs were 

1030
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,000
not always the strongest to strong guys.
Didn't take that much and uh,

1031
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,000
a lot of them.
And then,

1032
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:44,160
and the lesser guys take a ton of shit,
but he just can't necessarily.

1033
00:43:44,161 --> 00:43:45,560
That's not what strong.
Well,

1034
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:49,790
isn't there also a point of diminishing 
returns where like taking too much of it

1035
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:50,624
throws your body out of balance to the 
point where he's not going to recover 

1036
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:53,384
correctly because your body's constantly
dealing with this and it makes you 

1037
00:43:56,211 --> 00:43:56,720
crazy.

1038
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,100
Right?
He can't concentrate.

1039
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,150
Yeah.
That's a,

1040
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:01,100
that's a real problem that people don't 
want to admit it.

1041
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,320
The roid rage isn't a real thing.
I've seen it.

1042
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:04,760
It's real.
It's 100 percent real.

1043
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,470
I don't think there's such thing.
Roid rage.

1044
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:07,383
You don't think so?
No.

1045
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,290
Well you said it makes you crazy.
Yeah.

1046
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:11,300
But I don't seem to have a little guys.
You know,

1047
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:12,134
there's plenty of fighters would fight a
300 pound guy because it was just crazy 

1048
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:16,140
because you're crazy.
You know,

1049
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,080
it's not causing on roids are fucking 
crazy.

1050
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,003
Right.
But when people are taking too much 

1051
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:21,254
steroids and it makes you crazy,
a little guy's not going to jump on a 

1052
00:44:24,141 --> 00:44:25,470
big guy and get his ass.
Great.

1053
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:26,920
You know,
because of Roy Price,

1054
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,600
he'll do it because he's.
He was born that way to do it.

1055
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:32,100
There's two kinds of people praying 
predator.

1056
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,110
You'll find out which one you want to.
Real quick,

1057
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,140
your prayer Predator.
Lou,

1058
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,650
you're in this like very insulated world
and a lot of ways,

1059
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:41,484
right?
Because you're constantly around these 

1060
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:43,314
savages.
You're constantly around dudes that are 

1061
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:47,670
just fucking lifting and crazy 
heavyweights.

1062
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:50,430
Very manly men.
A lot of guys are doing steroids.

1063
00:44:50,431 --> 00:44:52,780
A lot of guys lifting weights like 
that's your world.

1064
00:44:52,781 --> 00:44:53,614
Like this is the.
These are the types of people that you 

1065
00:44:54,661 --> 00:44:55,494
surround yourself with.
A lot of people that are listening to 

1066
00:44:56,851 --> 00:44:57,690
this right now,
like,

1067
00:44:57,691 --> 00:44:58,524
this guy's fucking crazy.
Who's this guy with no biceps and been 

1068
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,680
on steroids for 40 years?
Like,

1069
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,620
this guy's a maniac.

1070
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,210
I Dunno.
I mean I,

1071
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:10,690
I was born to do something and I did it.
I,

1072
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:11,963
I,
I've never strayed from the way I've 

1073
00:45:12,771 --> 00:45:15,470
done one thing.
I'm going to go to the day I die.

1074
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,070
I'm not going to quit what I do 
everyday.

1075
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,080
I've got to try and make me better or 
someone else better.

1076
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,870
That's what I do.
That's the only thing I've ever done and

1077
00:45:23,871 --> 00:45:25,400
I never quit it.
Well,

1078
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,420
for you,
for a guy,

1079
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:27,254
if he was in my gym,
I would find a way to you to make you a 

1080
00:45:29,481 --> 00:45:32,180
better graph here.
I believe you.

1081
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,620
I believe you would just my job.

1082
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,433
I believe you would now being 68 years 
old if it wasn't for all your 

1083
00:45:38,981 --> 00:45:41,860
debilitating injuries that you've gotten
from lifting crazy amounts of weight.

1084
00:45:41,861 --> 00:45:44,590
You look great.
You look very healthy,

1085
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,000
like,
like very healthy.

1086
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,340
Like you have energy,
you're very,

1087
00:45:48,341 --> 00:45:49,111
you know,
you're,

1088
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:50,410
you're on top.
You're on the ball.

1089
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:52,150
When,
when I'm talking to you like,

1090
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:52,984
do you attribute a lot of that to take 
the steroids that it gives you that 

1091
00:45:55,301 --> 00:45:55,820
energy?

1092
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,330
We'll enter testosterone.
I mean,

1093
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,980
Lord,
I'm not saying I might be dead,

1094
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,530
but I mean I wouldn't be sitting here.
You wouldn't be talking to me.

1095
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,520
You wouldn't know who illusion is what.
I mean,

1096
00:46:05,521 --> 00:46:07,950
I broke my back in [inaudible] 73.
I had no training partners.

1097
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,610
I was on crutches for 10 months.
Everyday I get down in my basement.

1098
00:46:11,611 --> 00:46:12,444
I looked at a mirror ahead,
Amir and an am radio and in that mirror 

1099
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:16,110
and said,
how am I going to get better?

1100
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,960
What I gotTa do everyday?
I've never to this day.

1101
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,540
I mean I can't go until.
I mean you just can't pass out.

1102
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:25,200
He killed me in to God's witness,
so that's what got me out of my sport,

1103
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,150
but he was listening to this and here's 
that pounding on the roof.

1104
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:31,780
That's Ohio rain folks,
metal ceiling and the roof.

1105
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:35,110
So it's nice for us in California.
We don't get any rain ever.

1106
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:37,090
So nice to be down here.
Get some rain.

1107
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:39,570
So what stuff do you take?

1108
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,770
I mean,
right now?

1109
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:43,030
Yeah,
just testosterone,

1110
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:44,233
testosterone.
What have you taken normally when I've 

1111
00:46:47,231 --> 00:46:49,000
been trained,
but take a donabell capitalists,

1112
00:46:49,001 --> 00:46:50,850
you know,
I just did tests.

1113
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,230
You talked about that composer like that
component.

1114
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,490
What about human growth hormone?
Orange waste of time doesn't work.

1115
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,580
It's a waste of time.
Yeah.

1116
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,800
How so?
Well,

1117
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:04,830
you know I took is human growth before 
HIV came out and kidnappers called Chris

1118
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,323
Corman of ride.
That's the stuff that came out of 

1119
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:10,810
people's brains.
They took out a pituitary glands,

1120
00:47:10,811 --> 00:47:11,560
right?
That's right.

1121
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,450
Well then when it made sense not growth 
hormones,

1122
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,313
they never made some enemies.
Somatomedin triggers not a trope in 

1123
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,020
wishes,
growth or some matter meeting.

1124
00:47:20,021 --> 00:47:21,700
What does it about to meeting triggers?
Growth Hormone.

1125
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:24,160
And if you don't have,
they never made synthetic.

1126
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,003
Some atomy.
I mean people take growth hormone and 

1127
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:27,671
how many people,
you know,

1128
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:28,504
take growth hormone.

1129
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:31,720
If you take hormone,
you have to eat around a guy your size,

1130
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,940
you'd probably have to do seven,
seven,

1131
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:34,774
8,000 calories a day.
Is that blood sugar attacks one after 

1132
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:38,140
another?
You don't.

1133
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:39,430
People don't do that.
Why?

1134
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,690
Because it doesn't work and it knocked 
body fat off.

1135
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,790
You see people losing body fat and no,
it's a joke.

1136
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,310
It's a more um,
what's the word?

1137
00:47:48,311 --> 00:47:49,144
Placebo effect in anything.
So you don't think it helps people 

1138
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:53,550
recover from things?
Anything?

1139
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,510
I took tons of it.
I've been prescribed it.

1140
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,690
I have a fake shorter fake shoulder.
Yeah.

1141
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,700
What's going on with shoulder?
I had to have a shoulder replacement.

1142
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:02,380
Wow,
okay.

1143
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,610
If pros had a frozen shoulder,
had to replace this one and then um,

1144
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,383
uh,
so I got tons of growth for them and it 

1145
00:48:09,361 --> 00:48:12,430
didn't go through him or not,
I just gave it away as waste.

1146
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,470
Wow.
Dr [inaudible] study you.

1147
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:21,830
It seems like everything wrong.
Fake children really.

1148
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:23,703
And what,
what and what a exercise benchers you 

1149
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:30,730
bench press over 500 or the fake 
shoulder to doctors.

1150
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,383
I did 24 reps,
100 pound dumbbells with 2,400 pound 

1151
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,930
dumbbells.
Jesus Christ.

1152
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,660
That's insane.
It's in the mind.

1153
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,350
So you're saying it's all in the mind,
you know,

1154
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,193
there's a book a fighter's got.
Remember his name is called pain don't 

1155
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,590
matter.
It don't matter to me.

1156
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,600
I'm so freaking used to paint.
It don't matter,

1157
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:53,730
but it's a fake shoulder.
Like I don't mean are they,

1158
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,170
are you supposed to be able to lift that
kind of weight in a fake shoulder?

1159
00:48:56,171 --> 00:48:57,920
Like did doctors tell you,
be able to go

1160
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,310
back to training?
I had it done by the doctor.

1161
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,203
His name is Dr Bianchi was the Cleveland
Brown searching at the time and he 

1162
00:49:04,601 --> 00:49:07,270
basically gave me no instruction.
I left the hospital that day,

1163
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:08,104
I recovery and uh,
never I did my own therapy to give you 

1164
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:14,110
no instructions already knew.
He literally,

1165
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,123
it was new at the time.
He kind of wanted to see if it would 

1166
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:19,170
hold up my,
my,

1167
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:21,580
my buddy march was a strength coach with
the browns.

1168
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,100
He said this guy is crazy,
you know,

1169
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:25,523
so he wanted to find out this thing 
would hold up and it must have held up 

1170
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,320
because I mean,
you know,

1171
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,960
and it's still okay now,
man.

1172
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,720
Wow.
Score and you see this,

1173
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,020
you don't believe me?
Oh,

1174
00:49:35,021 --> 00:49:36,080
I believe you.
Yeah.

1175
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,240
Wow.
PCB did stuff.

1176
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,970
And so when you got your soldiers 
shoulder replacement,

1177
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:44,620
how long did you wait before you started
lifting?

1178
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,050
Heavy benching?
I started pinching in one week,

1179
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,430
started to branch to come one week.
That's so crazy.

1180
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,850
How much will you benching one week?
Not a broomstick,

1181
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,013
but in,
um,

1182
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,760
in three months I benched 300.

1183
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,900
That's so crazy.
That's crazy.

1184
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,430
Well,
in that case,

1185
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,380
I got to think steroids helped your 
recovery.

1186
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:06,720
I try.
Well,

1187
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:07,950
that's one of the best things for it,
right?

1188
00:50:07,951 --> 00:50:08,784
Is recovering for injury.
And that's one of the best argument is 

1189
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:14,140
send it to athletes and nuts too.
You just can't sit around the doctor.

1190
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,550
Take him for eight weeks.
That's why.

1191
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:20,560
Don't go to doctors out of being a leg 
becomes a quacks.

1192
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:26,320
Surgeons,
that's all they know.

1193
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:28,130
They don't know nothing.
They were experts on everything.

1194
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,050
So I don't know this Dr.

1195
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,970
well that's one of the best arguments 
for steroids is post-injury recovery,

1196
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,140
right?
It was for.

1197
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,910
It was for concentration camp victims in
World War II.

1198
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:43,030
Nineteen 39 antibiotics came up for 
concentration camp.

1199
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,850
They tried them to.
People come out of concentration camp,

1200
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,800
prisoner of war.
That's what they make.

1201
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,520
Antibody was first thing they made him 
for.

1202
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,600
Well it's really good for people that 
are wasting diseases.

1203
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,113
Same thing if you're in the prison of 
war camp and give you some sort of 

1204
00:50:56,081 --> 00:50:57,260
vitality back.
Yeah.

1205
00:50:57,490 --> 00:50:58,323
Yeah.
So when when you see guys that get 

1206
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,870
injured and you see them try to do 
things without steroids,

1207
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:07,150
like especially injury,
like injury recovery,

1208
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,013
I think that's one of the best arguments
that like maybe when an athlete blows 

1209
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:13,150
his knee out or something like that and 
get surgery,

1210
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:14,890
they really should be allowed to use 
that.

1211
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:17,630
Do you think are in America professional
athletes?

1212
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:20,900
All tone was in her at least 100 times 
more.

1213
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:25,610
There's a couple million older men 
taking testosterone replacement.

1214
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,590
So that's my art met.
Why would you not let an athlete?

1215
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,290
What is the difference?
And that's what I just said,

1216
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:33,820
but I don't care if you don't.
If you don't want to take,

1217
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:37,340
I'm fine with me a damn.
You don't wanna eat a protein shake.

1218
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:38,690
You don't eat right?
I don't care.

1219
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,770
Well when it comes to eating right,
like what kind of.

1220
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,810
What kind of Diet do you subscribe?

1221
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:50,620
I really don't describe.
I eat eggs and meat in the morning and I

1222
00:51:50,621 --> 00:51:52,040
ate pretty good.
You know what I mean?

1223
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:55,160
A lot of chicken and rice.
I'm not entered a good food.

1224
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:57,590
I've seen people real clean.
They have no aggression,

1225
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,970
so like a lot of bodybuilders super 
clean.

1226
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,290
It seems like I have no aggression and 
you know,

1227
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:07,100
if you're like what I outside the 
throwing punches or kicks,

1228
00:52:07,101 --> 00:52:08,150
it's the same.
It's a fight.

1229
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:11,480
You gotta fight these big white jeep.
You guys stay on Dad,

1230
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,420
you gotta lift it and then you got to do
it over and over and over.

1231
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,273
Just like,
you know,

1232
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,050
11,
10 to aggression now.

1233
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,540
Do you think that that's the lack of 
cholesterol in the Diet?

1234
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:21,680
Lack of fat?

1235
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,470
It may be because I've just seen them.
I mean,

1236
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,770
you know,
I've been around too many people.

1237
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:28,604
Bodybuilder also.
They were the one that had the side 

1238
00:52:30,111 --> 00:52:31,600
effects.
You'd get around.

1239
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,700
They of the guys that have no facial 
hair and uh,

1240
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,080
you know,
or nobody here.

1241
00:52:36,081 --> 00:52:36,914
It seems like those were the ones that 
I've noticed over the years and has no 

1242
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,034
side effects.
A little bit of drugs will give them 

1243
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:43,970
side effects and other people,
you know,

1244
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:46,590
you always talk about taking stuff for a
to come out.

1245
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,410
I've never taken anything like God darn 
life.

1246
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:52,070
I've never needed anything for Gyno,
for one made a real tough looking guy.

1247
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,993
He'd never had any problem taking raw 
because they're already got 

1248
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,360
testosterone.
It's not a.

1249
00:52:56,361 --> 00:53:00,480
it's not something new to their system,
but guys get guy.

1250
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:01,970
No,
it's just because they have a ridiculous

1251
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:04,190
amount of testosterone in your body.
Starts producing estrogen,

1252
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,980
high estrogen anyhow.
Oh,

1253
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:08,750
so you think it's just.
Exactly.

1254
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:12,380
Because I've seen guys with big,
thick beard,

1255
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,510
rough kind of guys.
You don't have no problem.

1256
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,460
You don't have a problem.
I'm just telling you what to.

1257
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:19,501
Right?
No,

1258
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:20,334
I get it in lab.
I'm only telling you what I've seen in 

1259
00:53:21,961 --> 00:53:24,330
my,
in through my many years,

1260
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:25,164
what I've seen guys,
the guys that get whacked out on drugs 

1261
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,160
where the guys are very,
uh,

1262
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,410
you know,
I'm not Finland,

1263
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,880
Finland,
but almost kind of

1264
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,573
when,
when the person who doesn't power lift 

1265
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:38,720
or people are unaware of the sport and 
they,

1266
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:39,633
they,
they think of a bodybuilder doing the 

1267
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:42,950
same kind of things that have gotten,
like you would do,

1268
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,810
that's what they think.
Oh yeah.

1269
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,213
But that's not the case.
What is the big difference between 

1270
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:50,983
bodybuilders?

1271
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:55,170
There's a high purpose,
high reputations in the eat different.

1272
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,033
They take other things different to get 
very big and then we don't want to get 

1273
00:53:59,121 --> 00:53:59,954
big.
We're just like,

1274
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:00,793
we wanted to stay in the smallest weight
class we can and get as strong as it 

1275
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:04,280
was,
the same big Ang strong,

1276
00:54:04,281 --> 00:54:05,114
strong,
strong.

1277
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,643
So we just want to be strong,
so everything we do is not to build 

1278
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,540
larger muscles.
Like I've worked with track people,

1279
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,523
mostly girls.
We don't want to put 10 pounds of 

1280
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:16,660
bodyweight,
almost 10 pounds of extra weight that it

1281
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:18,410
had to overcome gravity rundown down 
track.

1282
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,303
Right?
So we keep keep your body weight to a 

1283
00:54:21,021 --> 00:54:23,270
minimum.
The muscle mass,

1284
00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,283
we just want to make it strong.
You don't have to get bigger to be 

1285
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,180
stolen.

1286
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:27,013
That's confusing to a lot of people 
because a lot of people think of big 

1287
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:31,920
muscles meaning stronger and that's the 
only way to get stronger.

1288
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,720
But I've seen some people in power 
lifting competitions.

1289
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,870
It just lift insane amounts of weight 
and they're not that big trunk.

1290
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,380
Well how is that possible?

1291
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,690
But muscle type,
you know,

1292
00:54:40,691 --> 00:54:43,870
you're always talking about you.
I've always mentioned you a few times.

1293
00:54:43,871 --> 00:54:46,780
You talk about like a wooly and says,
oh my muscular.

1294
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:48,670
He runs out of gas real quick.
Who?

1295
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,590
Tyrone?
Tyron Woodley.

1296
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,120
Yeah.
He has the same.

1297
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,240
Got a pretty pretty much the same amount
of muscle mass.

1298
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,310
He just has very fast twitch muscle guy.
You,

1299
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,213
you're not about to.
Endurance may have board slow twitch 

1300
00:55:00,971 --> 00:55:01,804
muscle and then so that guy,
that's why he can fight five rounds and 

1301
00:55:04,631 --> 00:55:07,450
tyrone were to start to wear out 
somewhere in the second round.

1302
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,653
Well,
it's also because a guy like tyron is 

1303
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:15,131
capable of putting out so much energy,
like the way he can attack guys and move

1304
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:19,190
so fast.
It's like having a 500 horsepower engine

1305
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,530
versus having a 400 horsepower.
One's going to just use.

1306
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,180
Yeah.
Well just fashion.

1307
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:27,930
She got sprinters and marathon runners 
and it looked totally different.

1308
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:29,383
Yeah,
and so when someone looks at a 

1309
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,140
bodybuilder and they see this guy just 
covered in muscles,

1310
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:36,010
they assume that guy will be able to 
lift a ton of weights,

1311
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,770
but for the most part those guys can't 
live nearly as much weight as a garlic.

1312
00:55:39,771 --> 00:55:43,550
You can know that that's crazy to people
like that doesn't even make sense.

1313
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,930
Well,
like a lot of things are crazy.

1314
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,620
People do don't aren't in and know what 
we're mentioning.

1315
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:50,454
What about the anabolic stimulus?
Does it frustrate you that this lack of 

1316
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:58,480
understanding the general public has 
about this stuff?

1317
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,460
Absolutely.
Yo you ever.

1318
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:04,540
You ever look at the Olympics?
We look at our weight lifters,

1319
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,370
Olympic weight lifters.
We don't go to the Olympics.

1320
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,680
We never did hope to never get any 
Olympic.

1321
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:10,520
Never tend to worsen,
so if there's ever been.

1322
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,030
They said our Olympic weight lifting 
team is pretty bad.

1323
00:56:13,031 --> 00:56:15,180
We can't get the guy on the 18th.
All right,

1324
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,253
and they're just not very good.
You look at our women's gymnastics 

1325
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,950
people,
they're extremely strong.

1326
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:23,530
Ain't a blurb out of the water.
You Go China.

1327
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:24,523
There are male weight lifters and female
archery ministry muscular and they 

1328
00:56:27,341 --> 00:56:28,174
killed everybody that your gym's look 
pathetic these because they're all in 

1329
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:31,820
different systems.

1330
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,653
She didn't know who they are.
You got better coaches and and better 

1331
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:39,670
systems that take stuff so well.
American doesn't have good Olympic power

1332
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:41,390
lifters,
Olympic weight lifters,

1333
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,323
lifters.
We rule the world power of Jews in this 

1334
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:46,150
country.
American witnesses are not very good.

1335
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,100
They're not know terrible.
Really?

1336
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,650
No,
I did not know that.

1337
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:54,070
There was one girl what got a bronzy 
Olympic one girl got a bronze.

1338
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,770
We in,
in my sport,

1339
00:56:55,771 --> 00:56:57,530
there's 12 male way classes.
Uh,

1340
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,483
we hold seven of the total records my 
Jim Holtz to and in women there's 10 

1341
00:57:02,261 --> 00:57:03,094
week classes.
America holds nine of the 10 and my Jim 

1342
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,214
holds five.
I have the strongest male power lifter 

1343
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,940
ever lived.
Period.

1344
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,060
And the best and the strongest female it
will bury St Jim.

1345
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,120
Now what about shit like those strongest
men contests?

1346
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,920
Oh,
well her strongest guys.

1347
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,770
But that's a different thing entirely as
well.

1348
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,980
It's another defense.
Like boxing is different than intimate.

1349
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,360
Yeah.
More,

1350
00:57:25,361 --> 00:57:27,190
you know,
more ties different in boxing.

1351
00:57:27,191 --> 00:57:28,024
You know what I mean?
You never said I'm going to say it in a 

1352
00:57:29,981 --> 00:57:30,814
more Thai guy that's going to win a 
world boxing championship and vice 

1353
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:35,650
versa.
But I think it has

1354
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:40,670
happened.
Ty was what the fuck is his name?

1355
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:41,750
Oh,
there was a kid though.

1356
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,613
I mean,
the gold medal is thought Thailand 

1357
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,840
packet.
I think you shouldn't have your key.

1358
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,580
Might've been a one time champions on.
Right?

1359
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,730
Oh,
Chris Algieri.

1360
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,110
Yeah.
He was a kickboxing champion.

1361
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,120
Time to work out.
What's the fuck is his name?

1362
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,210
I forget his name,
but there was the guy that.

1363
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:05,300
He's the guy that John Claude van Damme 
was always supposed to fight.

1364
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,550
John Claude van Damme pretends is going 
to have a fight.

1365
00:58:07,551 --> 00:58:11,160
It's going to have a kickboxing fight 
with this is Thai guy and.

1366
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,750
But that guy won a world title as a boy 
tie fighter and as a boxer.

1367
00:58:14,751 --> 00:58:17,090
But that's pretty rare.
But I agree with you,

1368
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,370
but now like what would be the 
difference?

1369
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:22,520
See like if you see like if you had a 
guy come to you that wanted to win,

1370
00:58:22,521 --> 00:58:23,354
like a strongest man competition,
that seems like something that will be 

1371
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:26,504
right up your alley because you're so 
good at preparing fighters and 

1372
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:31,520
understanding the different demands of 
different sports.

1373
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:32,723
My friend in Finland's name Chicago,
he's got poor guys in that gym over 900 

1374
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,510
and they're all strong man and he does.
He trains of Straw man.

1375
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,030
Alright,
I'm not into that,

1376
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,240
but he told Tom and I had one thing in 
each sprint with barrels,

1377
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,383
thousand pounds on willpower.
We do a lot of willpower work and also 

1378
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,610
to carry heavy yoke.
So that's two of the primary.

1379
00:58:53,611 --> 00:58:55,020
Thank you.
Get them to be strong men.

1380
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,090
What's a yoke?
A Yoga thing,

1381
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:58,500
putting me back in your walk around with
it.

1382
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:02,340
Like if you walk around,
we do an enormous amount of walking with

1383
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:04,860
bars with a badge and change hanging 
off.

1384
00:59:04,861 --> 00:59:07,290
So it's unstable because that's what you
have to be.

1385
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:09,930
You got to be stable and unstable 
environment.

1386
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,090
So they walk a half a mile of stuff 
like,

1387
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:13,440
I don't know about it.
He gets his strong.

1388
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,473
Is that why you like wheelbarrows?
Because it's almost like a dead lift 

1389
00:59:16,221 --> 00:59:17,054
that you've got to kind of walk with it.
Like I'm going to price you will get 

1390
00:59:20,151 --> 00:59:20,984
more type fired at.
Doj thought that really helped us up is 

1391
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:24,790
um,
is plum colored clinch.

1392
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,150
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1393
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,223
Um,
so did you come up with the idea of 

1394
00:59:29,931 --> 00:59:34,931
using wheelbarrows for nine,
1990 and it's just something that looked

1395
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:39,550
to you like a good unstable platform 
that builds up your ministry ministry,

1396
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,930
building up your back and grip,
you know,

1397
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:43,410
you've got to have a grip.
So,

1398
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,280
you know,
you guys got great grips anyhow,

1399
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:49,910
but it builds up grip and it builds up 
all your muscles and your walking.

1400
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:51,290
See My,
you know,

1401
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53,150
a lot of guys do strength and 
conditioning.

1402
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:53,984
I believe it's got to be combined.
You don't have that much time because 

1403
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,670
fighting is a treatment and skill.

1404
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:02,150
You need all your.
I mean the world's strongest man.

1405
01:00:02,151 --> 01:00:02,984
Hate the damn the MMA champion now.
So I believe you got to strength and 

1406
01:00:05,991 --> 01:00:06,824
conditioning st time.
That's why we do so much outside 

1407
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:12,500
walking.
We're doing heavy objects walking.

1408
01:00:12,501 --> 01:00:14,270
So we're conditioning and strength 
training.

1409
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,700
Do you pay any attention to Marius 
[inaudible]?

1410
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,650
Oh sure.
He knows what he's doing now.

1411
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:20,080
He's fighting MMA.
Oh,

1412
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:20,923
I knew he did.
I didn't know he's still doing it by 

1413
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,500
lifting strong man and went to that.
Yeah.

1414
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:25,670
He's um,
he's,

1415
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,670
he hasn't given up.
He's been doing it for quite a long time

1416
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:32,180
now and he's actually beaten so pretty 
good guys at this point.

1417
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:33,560
He knocked out halls,
Gracie,

1418
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:35,540
and the first round he,
um,

1419
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,800
he lost it.
Tim Silvia.

1420
01:00:36,801 --> 01:00:38,540
But that's a fight that he never should 
have taken.

1421
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:39,643
But you know,
Tim Silvia is big giant former UFC 

1422
01:00:42,081 --> 01:00:43,350
heavyweight champion,
but you know,

1423
01:00:43,351 --> 01:00:46,640
you see tim,
Tim's got like a lot of body fat on him.

1424
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,310
He is not like the most gifted athlete 
in terms of like,

1425
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:53,360
like randleman is like a freak athlete.
He was when he was alive.

1426
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,870
Recipes.
Who's a great guy.

1427
01:00:54,871 --> 01:00:55,704
I love Kevin,
but he was probably one of the biggest 

1428
01:00:58,520 --> 01:00:59,353
natural genetic freaks I've ever seen.
Tim's not that Tim's just hard work and 

1429
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:09,450
dedication and just toughness and he 
beat the fuck out of Mary's [inaudible].

1430
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,510
It's kind of funny when you see the two 
of them together.

1431
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:14,060
I might've saw that fight.
Yeah,

1432
01:01:14,061 --> 01:01:16,730
he might've have,
but he started out.

1433
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:18,220
He started out kickboxing.
Denise,

1434
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,200
before we even went into a,
I think he kicked box when he was a kid,

1435
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:22,360
puts an asking,
did he?

1436
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:26,180
Maybe it was a boxer,
boxer,

1437
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,253
boxer,
okay.

1438
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:28,213
Boy,
do you not believe it when you see him 

1439
01:01:29,991 --> 01:01:32,550
hit the pads and he was starting out.
It was like,

1440
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,690
yeah.
It's like almost like,

1441
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,820
you know,
he's weighing himself down,

1442
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:40,730
like throwing weights all over his body 
and trying to move himself.

1443
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:41,563
It wasn't,
but my point being he's actually 

1444
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:44,564
transition is become a legitimate 
professional mma fighter who's beaten 

1445
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:50,100
some guys.
He's not.

1446
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,560
Not Bad.
I mean he's not.

1447
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,573
No one's gonna say he's a threat to the 
UFC heavyweight title least at this 

1448
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:55,544
point in time,
but it's interesting to me because he 

1449
01:01:57,541 --> 01:02:00,710
still 300 plus pounds.
He's still a massive,

1450
01:02:00,711 --> 01:02:01,544
massive guy and he's fighting.
All these events are all places where I 

1451
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:09,240
don't think they test them too,
which is interesting too.

1452
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:11,151
Tim.
Sylvia,

1453
01:02:11,151 --> 01:02:11,984
when he was at his best,
when he won the title against Ricoh 

1454
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,090
Rodriguez was on some shit,
but he was a.

1455
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:20,010
He looked so different back then.
He didn't look like a

1456
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,720
doughy sort of heavy guy over his best 
example.

1457
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,300
Ubereats?
Yeah.

1458
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,143
When when overeem came to the UFC,
when he fought brock lesnar and you 

1459
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:31,184
know,
it was kind of the wild west of testing 

1460
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,110
back then all you had to do was pass the
post test.

1461
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:38,550
That's it.
That's all you have to do.

1462
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,990
Which was,
you know,

1463
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:41,810
like you were saying,
if you take an avant,

1464
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,220
they just get off it for eight days.
You're clean,

1465
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,533
you know,
but the facts were obviously still 

1466
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:48,294
there.

1467
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,760
Exactly.
Yeah.

1468
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:53,050
I mean and has always been the drug of 
choice for collegiate wrestlers,

1469
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,073
you know,
way back years ago because the fact it 

1470
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:58,650
gets out of your system so quickly 
because he keeps your body weight down.

1471
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,990
You want the demurrage really 
bodybuilding,

1472
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:06,950
they take drugs that you know that on 
low calorie diets he can maintain muscle

1473
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:09,630
mass.
He touched the Princeton I think was the

1474
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:12,690
only one kind of antibiotics.
Why isn't bodybuilder look like I do and

1475
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,533
was part.
You know why they look different if 

1476
01:03:14,581 --> 01:03:17,040
we're taking the same drugs?
Because it totally is totally different.

1477
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:17,440
You.
Yeah.

1478
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,260
That's one of the orientations.
Totally different.

1479
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:22,510
One of the big dirty secrets about Vegan
bodybuilders,

1480
01:03:22,770 --> 01:03:27,770
like almost all Vegan bodybuilders are 
taking something and the reason being is

1481
01:03:27,821 --> 01:03:29,980
because of the fact they're not getting 
enough cholesterol,

1482
01:03:29,981 --> 01:03:33,700
they're not getting enough saturated fat
in their diet and so your body just does

1483
01:03:33,701 --> 01:03:35,650
not want to produce that kind of muscle 
mass.

1484
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:36,753
So those kind of guys are almost all 
taking something in order to put that 

1485
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:41,290
kind of mass onto their body.

1486
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:45,920
You know,
say we are trained to Olympic gold medal

1487
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:46,890
spreaders.
Alright.

1488
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,760
I've trained all kinds of people and so 
it's not like you just been around power

1489
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,720
lifting.
Everyone I know,

1490
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,850
you know,
there's a rate like,

1491
01:03:54,851 --> 01:03:56,680
you know,
we will get back to the drug tests.

1492
01:03:56,681 --> 01:03:59,350
You ever think about the Olympics?
People were records that the drug at the

1493
01:03:59,351 --> 01:04:00,184
Olympics.
What records of her breaking world 

1494
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:04,780
records drug free.
Why do you need drug testing?

1495
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,290
Maybe one of your callers calling me up 
telling me that one.

1496
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,080
Well,
because they're passing the drug.

1497
01:04:11,910 --> 01:04:12,743
Well,
well they're also catching them from 

1498
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:16,370
previous years.
Now you hear about the,

1499
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:17,560
uh,
the Russians,

1500
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:18,643
those two guys from 2008,
they got their gold medals pulled from 

1501
01:04:21,231 --> 01:04:23,690
them.
Just bullshit is bullshit.

1502
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,080
It's bullshit because you think other 
people were doing it too,

1503
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,693
of course.
But Russia has a very sophisticated 

1504
01:04:31,251 --> 01:04:32,084
anti-doping program in America.
Divergence now let's say that America I 

1505
01:04:37,101 --> 01:04:40,790
don't think is so blatant about their 
endorsement of drugs.

1506
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,320
I think America kind of knows about it 
and,

1507
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,180
but they can't come out and say it or 
come out and

1508
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:49,500
if you're overseas,
the pain just went to them.

1509
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:51,000
What place you got?
They don't care.

1510
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,630
How do you don't think they care?
No.

1511
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,260
Course.
Not Overseas.

1512
01:04:55,290 --> 01:04:56,123
No,
because it's,

1513
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:58,270
it's,
it's done by the state uses.

1514
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,433
It's done by the state.
And that what the problem was that 

1515
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:05,570
Russia was guilty because it was state 
funded drug administration.

1516
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:06,870
Okay.
What do I mean?

1517
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,300
They're doing the same thing happens.
Report.

1518
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,273
Well,
not just that rush is killing the 

1519
01:05:10,151 --> 01:05:12,490
scientists.
All the scientists know about it.

1520
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,463
A good giant percentage of those guys 
had been shot in the fucking heck we've 

1521
01:05:16,001 --> 01:05:17,680
been reading about that.
Oh,

1522
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:18,160
they're dropping

1523
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,360
like flies.
Yeah,

1524
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:21,580
all these guys,
because once Russia got in trouble,

1525
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:22,414
they were,
they were in danger of being eliminated 

1526
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:26,020
from the Rio Olympic Games.
You know about that,

1527
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,240
right?
Yeah.

1528
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:27,821
Well,
no,

1529
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:28,690
they didn't.
They,

1530
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:29,524
they allowed them in.
Now there was no way that they don't 

1531
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,420
forget how many people.
A couple hundred Russians did not go.

1532
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,630
Oh really?
And you know.

1533
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,760
Yeah.
And a girl here in America,

1534
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:38,594
it's a high jumper I think,
or a pole vaulter which tested 33 times 

1535
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:43,920
in three years.
That's bullshit.

1536
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:49,540
It's total bullshit.
I had victor content on my podcast,

1537
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:50,880
you know,
he has the ball co guys.

1538
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,740
I know who he is.
Yeah.

1539
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,080
He pushed all the roysher ever and then 
he's a drug test her.

1540
01:05:56,410 --> 01:06:01,410
Well now he's okay.
He's performed here for Peace Now.

1541
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:04,024
The.
Exactly.

1542
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:06,890
Yeah.
Um,

1543
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,160
he's,
he's an interesting case,

1544
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:09,994
right?
Because he was a guy that had developed 

1545
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:14,290
a designer steroid that was 
undetectable,

1546
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:17,020
which they still have.
They still have those,

1547
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,620
how they break and world records and not
bucking the drug test.

1548
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,720
You know,
I was born at night joe,

1549
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,640
but it wasn't born last night.
See,

1550
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:26,080
I was.
And,

1551
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:28,420
uh,
I like to believe that people are just,

1552
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,400
it's just hard work.
And folks who,

1553
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:32,980
uh,
believe in that,

1554
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,493
do you think it would be better if 
everybody just came clean and everybody 

1555
01:06:37,631 --> 01:06:38,980
just did whatever they wanted to do?

1556
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,880
Exactly.
I really did.

1557
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,180
I think or know why is your dad,
why?

1558
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,073
Why possibly is your father on going to 
the ancient clinic and taking 

1559
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:52,280
testosterone growth hormone?
It was that damn bad that you hit.

1560
01:06:52,281 --> 01:06:55,910
Your Dad wouldn't be going there.
There's a couple million people I know.

1561
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:56,744
You're just that guy.
There's probably over 2 million people 

1562
01:06:58,731 --> 01:07:01,040
doing it annually.
Why are they doing?

1563
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:03,860
That's a good point.
It certainly helps you.

1564
01:07:03,861 --> 01:07:05,710
It makes you and your brain function 
every.

1565
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,880
Everything's better.
It really,

1566
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,980
your drive,
your muscle,

1567
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:10,490
your muscle.
You've got more muscle.

1568
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:11,353
He got better bone density.
You got better sex drive and get better 

1569
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,350
dry period.
But I mean,

1570
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,200
mine is never changed.
That's my whole freaking problem.

1571
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,390
My brain's never changed since I was 
like 16.

1572
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:23,300
So your brain's still functioned the 
same way.

1573
01:07:23,301 --> 01:07:24,260
I think a lot of that

1574
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,330
face never get around a person.
And you just look,

1575
01:07:27,331 --> 01:07:28,164
here we go.
We're going to kick your fucking ass 

1576
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:33,950
because I don't know why they just can't
my camera.

1577
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:36,000
I just want to punch him out.
I can do that.

1578
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:39,290
Do you think that's road rage?
Not really.

1579
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:40,590
Bridge.
This was when I was born.

1580
01:07:40,591 --> 01:07:44,040
I was that way when I was 10 years old 
and I'm that way now.

1581
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,480
I just teach sometime.
Does it go?

1582
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:46,560
I want to.
And you know,

1583
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:49,380
it's weird because I can get around.
Old Man is no threat or nothing.

1584
01:07:49,381 --> 01:07:49,830
Me,
I'll go,

1585
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:54,210
I want to punch this guy in the face.
I'm serious.

1586
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,940
I know it sounds,
but then I go,

1587
01:07:56,941 --> 01:07:58,710
I can't do that.
I know I can't do that,

1588
01:07:58,711 --> 01:07:59,544
but I'm going home because.
Because there him and chuck is bitches 

1589
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,310
gonna Choke your ass.
I'm not,

1590
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:09,060
but I don't think it's enough in my 
brain and say,

1591
01:08:09,061 --> 01:08:09,894
no,
you're going to go to jail if you do 

1592
01:08:10,501 --> 01:08:11,334
that.
But that's how I've never changed right 

1593
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:14,963
now.
I don't know if I'd say sometimes I 

1594
01:08:15,951 --> 01:08:16,371
think,
Gee,

1595
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:18,110
I wish I changed.
It'd be a little bit mellow.

1596
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,670
Like I'm supposed to be.

1597
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,930
Well,
a lot of 68 year old guys,

1598
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:22,541
they're,
they're,

1599
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:27,000
they're slowing down and they don't have
a lot of zest for life.

1600
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:29,050
GRANDPA turns into grandma.
Yeah,

1601
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,080
it does happen,
right?

1602
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,943
Yeah,
that's right.

1603
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:37,260
You say I kinda weird too that you can 
go to like any kind of a nutrition store

1604
01:08:37,261 --> 01:08:38,094
vitamin store and this shelves are 
filled with muscle builders and 

1605
01:08:41,911 --> 01:08:44,130
recovery.
This growth hormone,

1606
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:46,410
that and fake test house rooms.
Yeah.

1607
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:47,303
Well,
and a lot of them turn out to be 

1608
01:08:48,301 --> 01:08:51,330
steroids,
but then he'd go to use against all.

1609
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,313
Well it is against the law,
but you sign it has a page and when we 

1610
01:08:54,871 --> 01:08:57,720
had no Wicki on the podcast,
and this is when I found out about this,

1611
01:08:57,721 --> 01:09:00,720
I was blown away because they have list.
What was it like?

1612
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:01,583
It was over a thousand more than a 
thousand different products that have 

1613
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:09,420
tesco have steroids in them that people 
are buying under the guise of just being

1614
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:10,254
some natural muscle builder or you go.
So there's probably thousands of people 

1615
01:09:13,051 --> 01:09:15,660
on here in America and city year against
taking drugs,

1616
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:17,300
but you're taking drugs,
right?

1617
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,950
Well,
there's certainly a lot of people that,

1618
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:20,971
well,
you know,

1619
01:09:20,971 --> 01:09:21,804
there's a lot of people that have taken 
drugs and they don't want to admit 

1620
01:09:23,881 --> 01:09:26,550
they're taking drugs,
like people want a drug free America,

1621
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:27,503
but they want to drink beer and they 
want to drink coffee and they want to 

1622
01:09:30,121 --> 01:09:32,050
smoke cigarettes.
All these things for trunks.

1623
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,273
Right?

1624
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:34,243
Yeah.
I've said that you'll go to a football 

1625
01:09:35,661 --> 01:09:36,720
game,
like a house steak.

1626
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:39,040
You got to,
you got 100,000 drunk take,

1627
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,420
you know,
up and smoking cigarettes,

1628
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:44,100
watching 22 athletes on the field that 
are clean.

1629
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:45,020
That didn't make any sense.

1630
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,513
I can't drive him out the parking lot.
Do you think that leave even for high 

1631
01:09:52,551 --> 01:09:54,740
school athletes that like steroids are a
good idea?

1632
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:58,600
I think when you're able to vote you 
out,

1633
01:09:58,601 --> 01:10:00,820
build you anything you want at 18 years 
old,

1634
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:01,810
God,
if you could drink,

1635
01:10:01,811 --> 01:10:03,880
why couldn't you take roids if you're,
you know,

1636
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:05,620
I mean,
I still believe it should be the draft.

1637
01:10:05,621 --> 01:10:07,000
I think that's what's wrong with America
today.

1638
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:07,834
There's no draft,
there's not enough people that have a 

1639
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:13,000
father figure in his country and I think
if they went in the army,

1640
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,740
you eventually have a father figure.
I was.

1641
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:17,920
Ios actually was a bought 10 or 12 years
old.

1642
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:22,660
I tend to block during summer vacation 
and then during school,

1643
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:25,340
the guy who picked me up and I actually 
knock holes out these that thing.

1644
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,193
There's called a knockout.
I will knock out these blocks and 

1645
01:10:28,081 --> 01:10:30,550
putting the word take out.
What's a block tender?

1646
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:31,413
What does that blog tenure?
I carried block and mixed mortar cement 

1647
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,020
block.

1648
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,390
Twelve years old,
12 years old.

1649
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:39,450
I started working at 12 years old,
I guess.

1650
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:40,750
Social Security card.
Twelve years old.

1651
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,120
That's right.
Wow.

1652
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:47,650
That's how I grew up and I,
I grew up by if I want to make money,

1653
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,580
I got to work.
No,

1654
01:10:48,581 --> 01:10:49,740
I had nothing.
And uh,

1655
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:50,530
you know,
uh,

1656
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:51,640
my,
my parents had money,

1657
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:55,090
but the party there were party animals 
and so I didn't get nothing.

1658
01:10:55,091 --> 01:10:57,220
I bought everything I've ever done since
I was 14 years old.

1659
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,280
No one's ever given me nothing.
People,

1660
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:01,780
you know,
with these guys day,

1661
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:03,040
I pay him to lift,
you know,

1662
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:06,970
if they make a world record or get on 
our board down there to get money.

1663
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,920
I never,
I would never take any money.

1664
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,470
I never took nothing.
He's guys get protein,

1665
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:13,770
they get free gear.
I took nothing.

1666
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:15,450
I own anybody,
anything.

1667
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,360
And when I die I won't owe anybody 
anything.

1668
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:22,900
So you think that way by saying that the
draft exists,

1669
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:23,734
like forcing people into the military 
force to them to serve would at least 

1670
01:11:26,471 --> 01:11:30,850
give them some discipline and give them,
like make them understand what hard work

1671
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:31,460
really is.

1672
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,820
Caucasian and discipline,
you know,

1673
01:11:33,821 --> 01:11:35,660
what's going on with the police force,
you know,

1674
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,790
in America today.
It's just a lack of,

1675
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:40,610
it's just a lack of common sense and I 
mean authority.

1676
01:11:40,611 --> 01:11:41,470
They don't have,
you know,

1677
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,080
represent authority.
I,

1678
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,160
I grew up,
uh,

1679
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:47,330
I remember was I used to play baseball.
I can help people to story.

1680
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,450
I was like 12 years old and we played 
this game.

1681
01:11:50,451 --> 01:11:52,130
If you hit a ball out the yard,
you're out.

1682
01:11:52,131 --> 01:11:54,320
But if you had inside,
he already got the second score.

1683
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,273
You got to score to run and it was just 
you against me with a neutral pitcher 

1684
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,700
and I slid into second base.
I was 12 years old and my neighbor was a

1685
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,010
high school senior.
I,

1686
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,710
I'm memory probably like 220 pounds and 
then he gets up and he said,

1687
01:12:06,711 --> 01:12:07,371
you're out.
And I said,

1688
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:08,204
I'm safe.
And he slapped the hard as he can slap 

1689
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:11,420
me and he goes,
you're out.

1690
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:12,920
I was out.
I couldn't kick his attitude.

1691
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:17,500
I grew up a pecking order.
No one knows what a pecking order is and

1692
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:18,343
number to picking nowhere you over,
but is that good for society to have 

1693
01:12:22,491 --> 01:12:23,324
that kind of a pecking order?
We wouldn't be ran over by all these 

1694
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:27,080
countries right now if we had a pecking 
order.

1695
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,720
Every look at the picking order now 
they're all,

1696
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:30,763
you know,
you go to school because you got 

1697
01:12:31,731 --> 01:12:33,590
bullied.
You know,

1698
01:12:33,610 --> 01:12:35,540
I got kicked out of school in first 
grade.

1699
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,670
Okay.
Not for a day.

1700
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,230
I got kicked out for the first grade.
A kid stole my shoe.

1701
01:12:41,231 --> 01:12:42,410
I won't tell my dad said,
hey,

1702
01:12:42,411 --> 01:12:45,680
this guy stole my shoes on their side to
Columbus here on east side,

1703
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:46,701
and he says,
well,

1704
01:12:46,701 --> 01:12:48,560
I'll tell you what he said,
if you tell me that tomorrow,

1705
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,453
a basic to basically said,
if you told me that one will kick your 

1706
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:53,834
ass.

1707
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:57,770
So I go to school kit tristate Mushu.
I punch and get in a fight with them and

1708
01:12:57,771 --> 01:12:58,581
teach it,
breaks it up.

1709
01:12:58,581 --> 01:12:59,414
I ended up punching the teacher.
They take me down to the principal's 

1710
01:13:02,481 --> 01:13:04,610
office and the.
And they said,

1711
01:13:04,611 --> 01:13:07,400
you're kicking me out of school.
So my mom says,

1712
01:13:07,401 --> 01:13:09,260
for how long is it?
We're kicking him out of school.

1713
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:12,920
I'm going to first grade.
So we moved across town over here on the

1714
01:13:12,921 --> 01:13:13,940
west side of Columbus.
You know,

1715
01:13:13,941 --> 01:13:16,100
we'll say Barbara,
but he wouldn't let me at school.

1716
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:16,934
I had to set it on a freaking year.
I didn't start school at seven years 

1717
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,910
old.
Wow.

1718
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:22,000
From Punch the teacher.
All right.

1719
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:24,410
What kind of teacher can't take a six 
year old punch?

1720
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:25,523
I have exactly.
It's basically back then that seems 

1721
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:29,624
ridiculous.
But I.

1722
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:31,660
But I still think that.
But you know,

1723
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:34,040
no one has any,
there's no trades in America,

1724
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:34,883
you know that they're talking about this
now knowing you don't have any 

1725
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:38,174
tradesman.
If they went in the army at least two 

1726
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:41,300
years,
you can get a couple of years of college

1727
01:13:41,301 --> 01:13:44,520
free education and something gets 
something from the government instead of

1728
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:45,650
a handout from the government.

1729
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:46,603
Well,
some people think that it would be that 

1730
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,034
mandatory military service would be good
because then they would realize the 

1731
01:13:50,841 --> 01:13:53,450
consequences of war that would really 
understand it.

1732
01:13:53,451 --> 01:13:55,490
Like Israel does,
like Israel,

1733
01:13:55,491 --> 01:13:56,324
everybody has mandatory military service
and their patriotism is at a very high 

1734
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:01,034
level because of that,
because they realize that they're all 

1735
01:14:03,081 --> 01:14:06,500
connected in this giant army.
When the army goes toward that literally

1736
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:07,334
is them.

1737
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:11,140
I believe the same thing.
I just think it would change.

1738
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:14,800
Think I can say this country so sick.
You know,

1739
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:15,511
your,
your,

1740
01:14:15,511 --> 01:14:18,160
your kids are older and they got these 
things because your kids building well,

1741
01:14:18,161 --> 01:14:18,994
you know,
I'd rather be the bully then to be 

1742
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:20,644
bullied.
I bullied everybody I kid could and the 

1743
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,220
bigger people bullied me.
That's just the way.

1744
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:32,500
Is that good though?
I know my role in society,

1745
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,353
but wasn't a little bitch and acted like
I run my mouth to you and you touched 

1746
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:37,480
me.
You know what I mean?

1747
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:38,860
I go call the cops.
Right?

1748
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,100
You beat my ass.
Fuck that guy beat my ass up.

1749
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,070
That's just the way it goes.
I mean,

1750
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,360
I've got 13 teeth.
Okay.

1751
01:14:46,361 --> 01:14:47,194
How are you thinking?
That's why I got 13 from running my 

1752
01:14:51,041 --> 01:14:51,874
mouth.

1753
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,153
Oh,

1754
01:14:54,690 --> 01:14:57,270
and I don't have no regrets.
No regrets.

1755
01:14:57,271 --> 01:14:58,104
It taught me lessons.
Was that the only way to learn lessons 

1756
01:15:00,691 --> 01:15:02,510
though?
I think it's a damn good for you.

1757
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:03,353
I think it's a good one.
You can't think you're something that 

1758
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:08,460
you're not.
You just have to grow.

1759
01:15:08,730 --> 01:15:10,740
That is a problem.
I just know what you really are.

1760
01:15:10,741 --> 01:15:12,690
That's all that matters.
Well,

1761
01:15:12,691 --> 01:15:13,524
I think a lot of people think there's 
something other than what they really 

1762
01:15:15,871 --> 01:15:19,100
are because they're not tested because 
they're not the.

1763
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:19,993
You know how many people in this life go
through difficult physical struggles on 

1764
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:25,524
a regular basis?
It's one of the main things that human 

1765
01:15:27,121 --> 01:15:28,440
being,
especially men,

1766
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:29,513
one of the main thing that men lack in 
life is very difficult physical 

1767
01:15:32,551 --> 01:15:35,130
struggles that tests your character.
Exactly right,

1768
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:38,970
but being a bully doesn't test your 
character or somebody that be bullied.

1769
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,180
What's all UFC fighters in the cage?

1770
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,680
Well,
once they get in there,

1771
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,260
but that's competition.
I know.

1772
01:15:45,261 --> 01:15:46,094
I mean,
I know they're great guys outside the 

1773
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:47,760
cage.
Matt Brown,

1774
01:15:47,761 --> 01:15:48,950
you know,
they're all nuts.

1775
01:15:49,010 --> 01:15:49,843
This Greg Guy,
I get crazy looking eyes real quick and 

1776
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:54,030
she's got crazy eyes.
You Fuck with Matt Brown?

1777
01:15:54,031 --> 01:15:55,600
That's a big mistake.
I mean that's a real.

1778
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,600
That's a test.
And you got to be tested.

1779
01:15:57,730 --> 01:15:58,580
Yeah.
And you know what?

1780
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,340
It don't get sad old thing.
You don't mark,

1781
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:01,890
you get knocked down.
Can you get back up?

1782
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:06,630
Got Back up to million times.
I'd never don't give a damn.

1783
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,310
I mean honestly,
it don't matter.

1784
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,710
You know,
like I always said like Canva,

1785
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:12,490
if Kevin will beat my ass.
Well,

1786
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,210
so what?
He beat a 100 other people.

1787
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,250
I'm just.
That long list would be be my ass.

1788
01:16:17,251 --> 01:16:18,061
What?
I feel bad.

1789
01:16:18,061 --> 01:16:19,240
No,
it can't be.

1790
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:21,480
Feel honored.
I got Kevin relevant,

1791
01:16:21,481 --> 01:16:22,314
kicked my ass.
Well that's because you could overcome 

1792
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:25,043
that kind of shit.
You've been through shit like that 

1793
01:16:26,761 --> 01:16:27,594
before.
You understand what it's like to have a 

1794
01:16:29,581 --> 01:16:31,620
bad moment in life and it's not going to
wreck you.

1795
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:33,820
Brush yourself off.
Yeah.

1796
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:34,953
That's the problem with people.
When your children get bullied and they 

1797
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:38,254
send them some kind of cool because 
you're bullied and my father sent me 

1798
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,430
because I got bullied,
I'd blow my brains out.

1799
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:48,380
Do you have kids?
No,

1800
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:50,600
I knew I should've never had kids on 
eradication.

1801
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,350
Wow.
How'd you.

1802
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:55,710
How'd you manage to get through without 
knocking up one check.

1803
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:59,100
My wife didn't want to have kids and I 
didn't want to have kids and she grew up

1804
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,650
pretty poor and like four or five 
brothers.

1805
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:02,484
Your mom raise your cut.
Your Dad got killed in a car wreck it 

1806
01:17:04,361 --> 01:17:06,420
too.
And I never want a kitchen.

1807
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:08,880
I mean my life's for.
Okay.

1808
01:17:08,881 --> 01:17:09,714
I don't have time for kids.
I wouldn't have time to be a good 

1809
01:17:11,571 --> 01:17:12,650
father.
I knew that.

1810
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,480
So why would I have kids?
Well,

1811
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:16,070
that's a very rational way of looking at
it.

1812
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:21,170
I've been married 43 years and I'm as 
you do that because of daylight,

1813
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:31,910
that's a smart way looking at do you 
have like when you,

1814
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:34,190
when you look at your life,
I mean at 68 years old,

1815
01:17:34,340 --> 01:17:37,380
you've accomplished so much,
has this great reputation in,

1816
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:40,000
in power lifting and you know,
just in,

1817
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:42,290
in helping people and athletes,
especially in mma.

1818
01:17:42,530 --> 01:17:44,680
I mean when I talk about you to the MMA 
fighters,

1819
01:17:44,681 --> 01:17:45,171
you know,
you,

1820
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:47,750
you have a fantastic reputation.
I mean,

1821
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,450
people just go.
They just nod their head and like,

1822
01:17:50,451 --> 01:17:51,590
that guy's the shit.
You know,

1823
01:17:51,591 --> 01:17:54,830
he knows his stuff.
Do you have goals at this point

1824
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,220
in your life?
Yeah,

1825
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:58,620
I should've got goals because we got to 
keep a couple of products.

1826
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,600
I want to get out before I die.
You know,

1827
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:03,200
I've gotten mechanical reverse hyper.
Did she talk about it?

1828
01:18:03,210 --> 01:18:05,570
She'd be an hospitals over the world and
mechanical one,

1829
01:18:05,571 --> 01:18:07,830
so it does it without you lifting 
weights is put you,

1830
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:09,840
stands you up and it will put you in 
place.

1831
01:18:09,841 --> 01:18:13,650
It can move your legs back and forth.
You get well then would assisted in it,

1832
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:15,600
you could read,
it would have resistance,

1833
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,900
so for someone who's like maybe two a 
week to actually lift the weights up,

1834
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,390
like if you couldn't move your legs,
visitors you'd like,

1835
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,210
I can move your leg.
You say okay,

1836
01:18:25,211 --> 01:18:26,140
that's it.
Okay,

1837
01:18:26,141 --> 01:18:26,974
that's it.
Then week after week until we finally 

1838
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:31,450
get that full range of motion,
once we gained full range of motion,

1839
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,410
then we could put a resistance to 
mechanical resistance for you picking up

1840
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:37,150
two pound,
three pound or whatever,

1841
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:39,580
but.
But it's static dynamic developer.

1842
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:40,414
I'm coming out was going to 
revolutionize the strength training for 

1843
01:18:41,441 --> 01:18:42,940
every sport.
Well,

1844
01:18:42,941 --> 01:18:44,450
I'm interested to see that.
Do you.

1845
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,180
Do you have that here?
No,

1846
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:49,110
we've got it on film.
We can a little bit on film,

1847
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,610
but when you feel that you would not 
believe it.

1848
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,170
Yeah,
I'm very curious.

1849
01:18:53,171 --> 01:18:54,004
I'm very curious to see what that's like
and I got one more book on writing a 

1850
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,950
book right now and then I'm pretty much 
done with discussing the editor and have

1851
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:03,580
it track and field a track now.

1852
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:04,443
Feel just track for sprinting and 
distance and just about developing 

1853
01:19:08,081 --> 01:19:10,450
strength for helping strengthen reducing
injuries.

1854
01:19:10,451 --> 01:19:13,330
There's so many injuries now.
What about an MMA,

1855
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:14,213
a dessert.
Do you think there's a way to reduce 

1856
01:19:15,461 --> 01:19:17,920
injuries and MMA through powerless?
Too much.

1857
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,250
Really?
Yeah.

1858
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:22,410
I think he's far but too much problem.
Then,

1859
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:23,244
uh,
I used to talk to guys way back in the 

1860
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,253
[inaudible] campus.
Big that guy because it was 95 percent 

1861
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:29,680
of fight.
He would go there.

1862
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:33,700
He was a kate one fire and he said,
and I think you've got to slow that down

1863
01:19:33,701 --> 01:19:34,750
because you're,
you know,

1864
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,730
they say in boxing fights,
don't get you.

1865
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,050
It's as foreign.
Yes.

1866
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,130
So that someone was firing,
working on skill and work on your skill.

1867
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:43,810
Was this thing.
They say that because that's the trend.

1868
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:45,250
Now,
Donald Cowboy cerrone,

1869
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:47,390
who's never looked any better than he 
does right now,

1870
01:19:47,391 --> 01:19:48,370
and he's on a tear.

1871
01:19:48,430 --> 01:19:50,710
He said he stopped sparring.
He doesn't spar.

1872
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,330
Says all I do is do drills.
He goes,

1873
01:19:52,331 --> 01:19:54,190
I already know how to fight or know I'm 
tough.

1874
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,810
He goes on,
don't waste myself in a gym.

1875
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:59,950
We have the greatest squatters bar ever 
in the history of the sport,

1876
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,140
and we don't squat.
We settled on boxes.

1877
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:03,910
We don't do regular squats.
What do you mean?

1878
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,220
We sit down a bunch of just sitting on a
chair.

1879
01:20:06,221 --> 01:20:09,420
We will and then stand back up.
I taught were you training to.

1880
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:11,730
We go to a contest,
then you got to do a squat.

1881
01:20:12,030 --> 01:20:14,980
We don't do any regular debit with a 
rope,

1882
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,440
a bar,
and real weights.

1883
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,300
None.
And our top,

1884
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:21,030
our top five average is 890 and

1885
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:22,410
10 is eight.
Sixty six.

1886
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,273
So you,
what do you do if you don't do regular 

1887
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:27,750
dead lifts?
We do bands over the bar in power racks.

1888
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:29,720
We use two or three different bands over
the bar,

1889
01:20:29,721 --> 01:20:30,690
meaning elastic band

1890
01:20:30,730 --> 01:20:32,470
instead of my edge,
220 pounds of attention.

1891
01:20:32,471 --> 01:20:34,260
Like if you picked up,
you know,

1892
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,010
200 on the bottom,
you stand up,

1893
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,220
it's 4:40,
right?

1894
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,300
Okay.
Or we got stronger boundaries.

1895
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,800
Oh,
did you have to kind of bands and,

1896
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:41,560
and uh,

1897
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,690
we just do a lot.
Stuff like that.

1898
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:45,690
So what that means to people that are 
listening to this,

1899
01:20:45,691 --> 01:20:47,430
when you have these elastic bands on the
bar,

1900
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:48,473
that makes it more difficult when you 
get up to the top of the range of 

1901
01:20:50,191 --> 01:20:52,890
motion.
That's the same with chains to it.

1902
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:53,380
Better?
Yeah,

1903
01:20:53,380 --> 01:20:55,550
changed.
It's called accommodating resistance,

1904
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:57,970
but it builds a tremendous acceleration 
in these.

1905
01:20:57,980 --> 01:20:58,813
A lot of band camp treat mentioned 
acceleration to very bottom because you 

1906
01:21:01,551 --> 01:21:03,380
knew you had at the outrun the bands.

1907
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,580
Right?
Right.

1908
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,593
So yeah,
you have to outrun the bands and then 

1909
01:21:06,741 --> 01:21:09,230
when you get to the top it becomes more 
difficult.

1910
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:10,333
So you when you have just a regular 
deadlift or a regular squat with it 

1911
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:16,190
doesn't have any of those bands at the 
end you have more horsepower.

1912
01:21:16,220 --> 01:21:17,870
Exactly.
Huh.

1913
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:22,960
So you don't do any regular squats or 
any regular deadlifts and you think that

1914
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:26,210
that helps you out.
That preserves athletes as well.

1915
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:27,143
Greatest.
Squatters your greatest male female 

1916
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:29,970
pilot.
We had a number one,

1917
01:21:29,971 --> 01:21:30,804
number two,
greatest quality of all time and I've 

1918
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:36,090
got a one 65 I think have become.
He's going to be the great squatter bolt

1919
01:21:36,091 --> 01:21:39,510
on or thinking about 950,
five pounds of one 69,

1920
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,500
955 pounds at 165.
That's insane.

1921
01:21:43,501 --> 01:21:45,000
Dot eight nine.
He did that easy.

1922
01:21:45,330 --> 01:21:47,160
That's incredible.
And keep him out of jail.

1923
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:48,400
Oh,
it was crazy.

1924
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,470
And a little bit.
How weird.

1925
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,010
Wow.
Let's just say he's.

1926
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,710
We'll just say straight down.
Yeah.

1927
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,210
Well,
I would imagine.

1928
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:58,163
Well,
I mean it's not the case with almost 

1929
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:02,130
everybody who's like at the very top 
levels of anything.

1930
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,440
Normally people only give you normal 
results.

1931
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:05,820
Whew.
That's a good quote.

1932
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:09,510
That's a good quote.
That needs to be a meme as normal people

1933
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:11,940
only give you normal results.
I don't need normal people.

1934
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,373
Yeah.
That's an interesting way of looking at 

1935
01:22:14,731 --> 01:22:15,564
it.
Well,

1936
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:16,813
I mean that's what I was saying before 
that you're kind of insulated because 

1937
01:22:18,451 --> 01:22:20,580
you're in this world of savages,
you know,

1938
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:24,150
in your attitude about things like,
this is not an attitude that most people

1939
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:24,984
have in 2016.
Everybody's worried about everybody's 

1940
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:27,924
feelings.
Everybody's worried about being 

1941
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:29,424
sensitive.
You know that this is the time of toxic 

1942
01:22:32,641 --> 01:22:35,790
masculinity.
People worried about masculinity.

1943
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,230
Strange,
right?

1944
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:39,690
Forgot like you.
Isn't it strange I'm going to do.

1945
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:41,260
I think the world is screwed up and

1946
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:43,811
you know,
I,

1947
01:22:43,811 --> 01:22:44,644
I,
um,

1948
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:45,493
had told Tom to buy all these books and 
the straw man back in 1900 and they all 

1949
01:22:49,791 --> 01:22:50,624
look like mma fighters today.
Men Don't look like at today like I did 

1950
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:56,480
back then.
No loan before roids.

1951
01:22:56,630 --> 01:22:59,490
They looked like gamers loaded to the 
gills and there wasn't a road back.

1952
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:01,220
He was probably,
food was better.

1953
01:23:01,221 --> 01:23:02,054
Maybe,
I don't know,

1954
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:04,850
but they all had attitude and everybody 
will kick your ass.

1955
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:07,540
So I just,
I don't know that I can send to warrants

1956
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:09,100
to soft man.
It's got to be hard.

1957
01:23:10,010 --> 01:23:13,030
You can have an easy life because once 
things get hard,

1958
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:16,300
you're screwed.
I see that in my sport.

1959
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:20,200
I watched guys will accelerate them so 
fast and it gets hard to quit.

1960
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:22,780
We like in a fight.
I'm done.

1961
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:24,790
I just quit tap.
I am,

1962
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,050
I'm Outta here.
You know,

1963
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,030
punch me in the face.
Well done.

1964
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:27,903
I'm done with.
That drives me insane because work 

1965
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:34,510
hundreds of hours to get these guys 
super,

1966
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,130
super strong and then they quit,

1967
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:37,633
but doesn't that make you appreciate a 
guy like a matte brown or someone like 

1968
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:45,130
who is like a legitimate check from that
I respect for all finders.

1969
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:46,300
I mean,
you know,

1970
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:47,200
any fire.
Okay.

1971
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:49,300
What level?
But they get into UFC cage.

1972
01:23:49,301 --> 01:23:50,320
I got loud,
respectful,

1973
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,680
but in 2016 does have rare type of 
person.

1974
01:23:53,681 --> 01:23:55,480
Right?
In this ever softening world,

1975
01:23:55,481 --> 01:23:58,000
don't you think that's why MMA is so 
popular?

1976
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:59,013
Because everybody wants to be that,
but they don't want to go through that 

1977
01:24:01,361 --> 01:24:02,194
work.
It's also the recognize how unique it 

1978
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:05,170
is.
They recognize.

1979
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:06,093
I mean there's a lot of people that I'm 
friends with like MMA that they don't 

1980
01:24:09,521 --> 01:24:10,354
have those qualities themselves,
so they appreciate them and other 

1981
01:24:12,031 --> 01:24:12,280
people.

1982
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,900
That's exactly what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1983
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:17,090
I've always admired fight.
I'm a huge boxing fan,

1984
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,820
like triple g and guys like that.
Me Too.

1985
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,070
You know?
So Roman Gonzales' classical boxers,

1986
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,960
man,
I'd like to classic because uh,

1987
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:27,050
you know,
you go try to do it.

1988
01:24:27,051 --> 01:24:29,890
It's not easy to do at no works insane.
Oh yeah,

1989
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:32,020
and everybody thinks it's a brutal.
Even boxing.

1990
01:24:32,021 --> 01:24:33,740
I was a brutal sport and they think in 
the maze.

1991
01:24:33,741 --> 01:24:36,710
I don't want to think that,
but there's a lot of so much technique.

1992
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,860
There's more technique than anyone would
ever really imagined.

1993
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,050
Ridiculous.
You know another thing that fighters are

1994
01:24:42,051 --> 01:24:44,500
getting into a lot lately as yoga.
That's a.

1995
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:46,280
that's a big one.
Did you ever mess with that?

1996
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,721
But.
No,

1997
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:47,990
I haven't,
but I probably should.

1998
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,480
I know Matt was doing yoga,
right?

1999
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:50,323
Hot Yoga.
We got to subtract girls to do the hot 

2000
01:24:52,161 --> 01:24:53,300
yoga.
They say it's really,

2001
01:24:53,301 --> 01:24:54,140
really good.
Well,

2002
01:24:54,141 --> 01:24:54,974
it's a great thing for your back.
That's one of the reasons why I brought 

2003
01:24:56,901 --> 01:24:57,734
it up.
It's amazing for like lengthening your 

2004
01:24:58,911 --> 01:24:59,744
spine.
There's certain decompression exercises 

2005
01:25:01,401 --> 01:25:02,234
that you do in Yoga where you.
You grabbed the bottom of your heels 

2006
01:25:05,031 --> 01:25:08,420
from underneath and you're pulling and 
straighten your legs out.

2007
01:25:08,421 --> 01:25:10,340
You literally feel your back on like 
pop,

2008
01:25:10,341 --> 01:25:10,791
pop,
pop,

2009
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:11,624
pop,
pop.

2010
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:15,080
Like I do it all the time and I can feel
my back,

2011
01:25:15,081 --> 01:25:18,530
especially in the middle.
I feel it's separating and it makes it a

2012
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:20,750
little pop,
almost like you're getting adjusted by a

2013
01:25:20,751 --> 01:25:21,584
chiropractor.
Is that something that you would 

2014
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:27,410
recommend to your athletes?
Is that something you might think about?

2015
01:25:27,610 --> 01:25:29,810
If it's not an advantage,
a disadvantage,

2016
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:32,750
anything of a person I want them to do 
now.

2017
01:25:32,751 --> 01:25:33,380
What about,
uh,

2018
01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:35,930
other kinds of therapy,
like a cold therapy,

2019
01:25:35,931 --> 01:25:37,570
ice bass,
cryotherapy,

2020
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:38,563
things like that.

2021
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,560
Prolotherapy,
stem cell,

2022
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:45,900
platelet injections.
If you could think of it.

2023
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:47,450
I've done it.
I wouldn't even get it.

2024
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:48,403
I don't want your cat and your readers 
to hear everything I've done because 

2025
01:25:50,931 --> 01:25:52,040
they would probably have me locked in.

2026
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:54,240
Like what have you done that would have 
you locked up?

2027
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:56,520
I've used our stint and strict nine 
injections.

2028
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:58,940
What?
Strychnine arsenic.

2029
01:25:59,050 --> 01:26:00,990
Strychnine or arsenic and strychnine.
Right.

2030
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:04,070
Why would they inject you with poison?
Because it raises your red

2031
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:07,610
blood cell count.
I've used nitroglycerin.

2032
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:12,960
Nitroglycerin cream because you know,
in a stimulating blood flow and me start

2033
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:14,000
your heart up.
Right?

2034
01:26:14,001 --> 01:26:17,150
And I use it because I broke my back and
I didn't want to admit I broke my back a

2035
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:18,770
second time.
So I use it,

2036
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:21,560
I told my friend who was a professor at 
Ohio state that says,

2037
01:26:21,561 --> 01:26:22,320
don't go nowhere.
Well,

2038
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,690
we'll see what his does.
I mean,

2039
01:26:23,691 --> 01:26:26,390
I was raised and being for three hours,
it felt like you were hit me in the head

2040
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:28,820
every,
every heartbeat just hit me in a temple.

2041
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:30,110
And um,
so,

2042
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,140
but I've done it all.
There's nothing I haven't tried.

2043
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:35,920
I did electric statement,
I think it was called a microwave.

2044
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:39,620
It lengthens out the muscles.
I'm Tom did it for what?

2045
01:26:39,621 --> 01:26:42,050
Fifteen seconds?
I did for 96 minutes.

2046
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:43,453
What does it do?
It lengthens out the muscles literally 

2047
01:26:44,841 --> 01:26:47,870
straighten out your leg right off the 
ground is electrocuting you.

2048
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,090
And uh,
for six minute segments.

2049
01:26:50,091 --> 01:26:53,390
And I did 96 minutes.
So it's electrical muscular stimulation.

2050
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:55,660
It lengthens it.
Yes.

2051
01:26:55,661 --> 01:26:58,130
And I should never done it because I 
think I've got too many injuries,

2052
01:26:58,131 --> 01:27:00,830
you know,
and it basically tore.

2053
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:01,880
It popped my,
uh,

2054
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:03,810
my hips and my shoulders out,
his uncle.

2055
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:09,290
What if my hip don't?
Six hour right here,

2056
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:17,560
my hipbone crazy here.
Your whole body's like a walking medical

2057
01:27:17,601 --> 01:27:18,434
encyclopedia.
You know when you got to try it right 

2058
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:21,713
now,
I guess road warrior say desperate men 

2059
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:27,310
do desperate things now.
I'm very desperate.

2060
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,570
Hold from what's.
What's worked the best for you?

2061
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,433
Did stem cells work out well for you?
While I'm finding out because what has 

2062
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:33,494
been about three weeks against stem cell
in both hips and my knee and my 

2063
01:27:37,281 --> 01:27:38,990
shoulder.
And what's wrong with your hips?

2064
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,640
Oh,
there's some squatting ride.

2065
01:27:40,641 --> 01:27:42,200
Just beating the crap out of myself.

2066
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,170
It was all torn out.
I'm shorten real wide.

2067
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,540
So all your parents are here for 
fighting,

2068
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:51,920
so it's just all wear and tear.
And do you feel any different?

2069
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:55,990
So I think it's starting to work.
See,

2070
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,530
I wasn't allowed to take anti 
inflammatories.

2071
01:27:57,531 --> 01:28:02,010
I've been on an antiinflammatory.
Nike's 1991 because uh,

2072
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,520
I didn't really die.
See when I tore my knee off,

2073
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,640
I'm allergic to anesthesia so I went 
back in the beginning is fine.

2074
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:09,413
Yeah.
So I went back in and gave me a shot to 

2075
01:28:12,951 --> 01:28:15,410
sort of calm me down for surgery,
to take the wires out of my knees,

2076
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:19,370
out of my knee and it put me to sleep.
He gave me on stages and they're getting

2077
01:28:19,371 --> 01:28:22,210
trached why?
Like I'm jumping around.

2078
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,440
There's ticket chest tubes in me.
And that really,

2079
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,200
that's how I got the rest of that.
They several,

2080
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:27,053
my intercostal nerves,
they severed your intercostal nerve had 

2081
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:30,974
at lh,
five to five or six doctors telling me 

2082
01:28:32,341 --> 01:28:33,440
that's exactly what they did.

2083
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:37,460
Only a chest tubes in me.
So at that point,

2084
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:38,950
91.
Um,

2085
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:39,933
and,
and I'm going to tell you about my gym 

2086
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:42,860
and this is why the trade partners I 
had,

2087
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:44,690
I did step in 50.
No one's ever done.

2088
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:45,823
And this is how,
because I was in intensive care for 

2089
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:51,140
about four days and I was in house with 
three more days and I got a,

2090
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,440
I didn't need a trake I could talk 
because I trained a.

2091
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:56,360
So they take my throat shut.
He got ahold of this big.

2092
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:57,523
I got stitches in my side.
They take me out of the hospital to the 

2093
01:29:00,141 --> 01:29:01,530
gym as well.
Tuesday.

2094
01:29:01,531 --> 01:29:03,990
But then suddenly I go to the gym and I 
go,

2095
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:06,240
I'll walk on crutches.
He got money,

2096
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:08,670
you know,
they find out and is you're maxing out,

2097
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,490
you know,
motherfucker,

2098
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:11,520
and I says,
what?

2099
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:13,500
They laid me down,
I've been street 55.

2100
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:16,440
Who are they?
Who's their trading partners?

2101
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:18,290
They're out of their fucking minds.
Exactly.

2102
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:20,580
They tried to kill me,
tried to kill him,

2103
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:25,260
and that's what you got to have.
You've got to have people like that.

2104
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:28,730
They drove me to the point that when 
they told me that if I,

2105
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:30,760
if they told me they kicked me,
I'm old jump.

2106
01:29:30,761 --> 01:29:34,500
I didn't do it.
Just tell me male the man.

2107
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:37,170
That's just so ridiculous.
What a training.

2108
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:43,690
That is so ridiculous.
Well,

2109
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:46,560
I understand your attitude now.
You know,

2110
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:48,190
if you don't have an attitude,
you don't have anything.

2111
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,770
I've had some great results with stem 
cells.

2112
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:52,910
Stem cells are probably going to help 
you quite a bit.

2113
01:29:53,090 --> 01:29:54,310
You ever neck?
No.

2114
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:54,850
Oh,
okay.

2115
01:29:54,850 --> 01:29:58,390
I just had it in my shoulder.
I had it in my knee and my hip.

2116
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:01,030
But uh,
the big one was my shoulder man,

2117
01:30:01,031 --> 01:30:02,440
my shoulder,
my hip.

2118
01:30:02,441 --> 01:30:06,100
Was this a minor soreness and I was 
saying like do it preventative.

2119
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:07,083
And it definitely had an impact on it.
My knee highs have an on and off pain 

2120
01:30:10,001 --> 01:30:10,834
for years.
And my knee completely cured that up in 

2121
01:30:12,131 --> 01:30:14,470
my shoulder.
It healed it like nothing I've ever done

2122
01:30:14,471 --> 01:30:15,370
in my life.
Wow.

2123
01:30:15,530 --> 01:30:16,363
Yeah.
Well I got for the break of needing 

2124
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:22,360
shoulder surgery to no pain at all.
Well this shoulder it gives out of place

2125
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,380
every freaking day.

2126
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:24,213
And they got to put my.
I separated my shoulder and say I got a 

2127
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:27,750
big guy,
puts it in everyday.

2128
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:31,050
So I'm hoping every day I could be put 
in everyday.

2129
01:30:31,420 --> 01:30:33,900
What pops it out.
Just strange.

2130
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:35,410
I mean just strained the ligaments,
tendons,

2131
01:30:35,411 --> 01:30:36,244
I think over the years.
So it's not even anything you're doing 

2132
01:30:37,991 --> 01:30:38,760
physically,
like not,

2133
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,260
not even lifting weights.
It constant wear and tear,

2134
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:42,423
you know,
I mean it's just like playing pro 

2135
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,310
football,
you know what I mean?

2136
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:47,890
But I'd done this for all those years.
I mean,

2137
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,900
you know,
I mean I was in,

2138
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:53,400
I was a nightmare record in 1971.
Wow.

2139
01:30:53,830 --> 01:30:55,560
And then um,
so then,

2140
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:56,460
uh,
2000,

2141
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:58,570
three or four,
whatever the eye and where it was,

2142
01:30:58,600 --> 01:30:59,470
2000,
five percent,

2143
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:01,690
top 10.
Wow.

2144
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:03,740
So do you do any exercise at all?
Now?

2145
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:06,490
Trained this smaller crap.
But when he goes to bed,

2146
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:07,900
I'd like to walk on tires.

2147
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:08,733
I do belt squads.
I had to quit because my knee was so 

2148
01:31:10,511 --> 01:31:11,344
bad,
but I want to get back where I can 

2149
01:31:11,561 --> 01:31:13,480
deadlift.
I love the deadlift,

2150
01:31:13,481 --> 01:31:14,980
the deadlift.
You don't just kick your ass.

2151
01:31:14,981 --> 01:31:18,280
I mean if you can live you can still 
fight if someone attacks me.

2152
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:18,951
Right,
right,

2153
01:31:18,951 --> 01:31:19,300
right,
right.

2154
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:24,250
Which is quite possible because the way 
you talk in his podcasts,

2155
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:26,890
get any a woman's ass eddie.
Wow.

2156
01:31:26,891 --> 01:31:28,810
That's amazing.
Strong words.

2157
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:32,230
So like what,
like when you lift weights today,

2158
01:31:32,231 --> 01:31:34,150
like you,
you lift in Max,

2159
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:37,210
are you maxing out or just getting some 
exercise?

2160
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:40,530
Because I been squatting and dead lift,
just,

2161
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,300
you know,
top dog squad right on,

2162
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:45,100
in my,
almost my first meet.

2163
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:47,320
I mean when the neck,
if you're going to pass out,

2164
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:48,300
you just have to,
you know,

2165
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:50,100
comes a time.
You just got stuff.

2166
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,900
Now when you're talking about doing the 
reverse hyper with that neck,

2167
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:55,540
a neck harness on,
does that help you?

2168
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:58,600
We actually do a bunch more supreme,
a severe thing.

2169
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:00,270
We do neck,
neck deadlifts,

2170
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,680
out of my belt squat machine with a neck
harness.

2171
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:05,920
What's a neck deadlift?
So you put up a net carbs on his machine

2172
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:07,260
and he squad over.
You just stand up.

2173
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:09,113
Oh,
so you're doing your deadlifts and just 

2174
01:32:09,911 --> 01:32:10,990
with your neck,
with your neck,

2175
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:11,883
how much weight are you doing that with 
a on that machine where the machine 

2176
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:15,770
weights?
I've done about 40 pounds.

2177
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:17,920
Looks at the whole lot.
Yeah,

2178
01:32:17,921 --> 01:32:19,870
40 pounds a lot to be hanging off of 
your neck.

2179
01:32:19,871 --> 01:32:20,500
Yeah.
Plus that.

2180
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:21,333
Plus the cage.

2181
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:25,870
One hundred 95 pounds.
Ninety five pounds.

2182
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,390
Are you still doing that?
Yeah,

2183
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:30,690
it seems to make me feel better.
It makes you feel better.

2184
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,020
It makes your neck feel better.
Yeah.

2185
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,220
That's interesting because that would be
like counterintuitive.

2186
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:36,093
A lot of people would think that a lot 
of people think you shouldn't lift any 

2187
01:32:37,691 --> 01:32:39,010
weights with your name,
your neck.

2188
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,690
Like I talked to Kelly,
started about it,

2189
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:43,840
you know that eight way neck machine,
you know that thing he says,

2190
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:45,580
don't ever do that.
It's bad for your neck.

2191
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:48,580
And then I've talked to other people who
are athletes who were fighters,

2192
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,500
so it's one of the best things you could
do for your neck.

2193
01:32:50,590 --> 01:32:53,440
You got to in the NFL,
the problem,

2194
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:54,850
they don't train their nickname or mira 
big.

2195
01:32:54,851 --> 01:32:57,880
Everybody's neck was Russell.
He was real big.

2196
01:32:57,881 --> 01:32:58,780
What do you play?
Football.

2197
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,830
You don't see that anymore.

2198
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:04,570
It they neck is a the two most bomber of
a piece of jewelry back in your neck.

2199
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:07,660
No one trains them because they're 
afraid to write.

2200
01:33:07,661 --> 01:33:10,060
Well there.
That's what I keep hearing that it's bad

2201
01:33:10,061 --> 01:33:10,894
for your neck to lift weights with it,
which seems so weird because it's not 

2202
01:33:13,241 --> 01:33:15,640
bad for your lower back to do dead 
lifts.

2203
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:16,623
It's not bad for your lower back to do 
like reverse hypers or Roman chair 

2204
01:33:20,651 --> 01:33:21,820
setups,
ups or anything like that.

2205
01:33:21,821 --> 01:33:22,654
And I think a guy called Paul and strong
assumed never lived way back in the 

2206
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,210
fifties,
but he thought the neck was,

2207
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:32,170
was the most neglected muscles.
And it shouldn't be the most used muscle

2208
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:33,280
cars.
What happens to us,

2209
01:33:33,281 --> 01:33:36,150
we have bad necks because if you don't 
do anything,

2210
01:33:36,151 --> 01:33:38,020
we'll get bad neck.
So do you think it's,

2211
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:38,943
it's a real issue with grapplers,
like grapplers almost always get served 

2212
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:43,530
cervical herniations.

2213
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:44,663
Do you think that a lot of that could be
prevented if you just strengthened up 

2214
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:48,280
your neck?
Yeah.

2215
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:49,950
Well,
you know my print John Sader,

2216
01:33:49,951 --> 01:33:51,300
I mean to this day,
67,

2217
01:33:51,310 --> 01:33:52,143
he gets out and does neck bridges for 
five minutes and does $500 dollars 

2218
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:59,320
qualities in 6,500 Hindus squats in a 
row at time.

2219
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:00,580
That's insane.
He,

2220
01:34:00,581 --> 01:34:02,370
that's what he does,
that he gets out of bed.

2221
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:03,223
He does it every day,
five minutes at neck bridge and $500 

2222
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,900
course.
That's amazing that I could do them in a

2223
01:34:07,901 --> 01:34:09,730
row and I could do $200.
No,

2224
01:34:09,780 --> 01:34:13,750
my fucking legs turned a rubber.
I've got to step up my game.

2225
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,570
500.
Wow.

2226
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:18,670
And how old is he?
I'd say 62 years.

2227
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:21,850
Sixty three busy on the shit.
I don't know.

2228
01:34:22,150 --> 01:34:23,540
You don't know?
You don't ask him.

2229
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,113
Don't talk to older guys.
Talk to about other bds to coach for 

2230
01:34:27,731 --> 01:34:28,400
seven years.

2231
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:29,233
Oh,
okay.

2232
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:30,263
That's.
Well that's a big one for grappling a 

2233
01:34:32,021 --> 01:34:32,854
lot.
A lot of old school grad course in 

2234
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:35,870
particular.
Love the Hindus Quans.

2235
01:34:36,640 --> 01:34:37,473
But that's amazing that they can still 
do neck bridges and everything like 

2236
01:34:39,071 --> 01:34:40,750
that.
And he's at that age.

2237
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,540
I mean he's a black belt in judo,
Samo Jujitsu,

2238
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,340
black belt in Japanese.
More time.

2239
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,470
He still trains.
He trains all the time.

2240
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:52,320
Wow,
that's amazing.

2241
01:34:52,690 --> 01:34:54,630
He just had some miniature.
He's but he's back now,

2242
01:34:54,631 --> 01:34:56,050
but I think he can roll around a little 
bit.

2243
01:34:56,051 --> 01:34:57,040
So.
Wow.

2244
01:34:57,230 --> 01:34:58,790
Hip Surgeries and a replacement or 
whatever.

2245
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,990
That's another real common one.
Mark Coleman's got a hip replaced.

2246
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:03,880
Two.
So common,

2247
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:05,130
a hip replacement.
Um,

2248
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:08,990
everything else lasted.
Hm.

2249
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:10,940
That's interesting.
Way Pass everybody.

2250
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:12,343
Well,
what they're hoping now is that through 

2251
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:13,874
the use of stem cells that your body's 
going to be able to regenerate tissue 

2252
01:35:16,071 --> 01:35:18,980
and a lot of areas where it couldn't 
before and that's going to prevent a lot

2253
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:21,560
of replacements and a lot of surgeries 
and a lot of things.

2254
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:25,720
They think that sometime in the future 
that stem cell based therapies are going

2255
01:35:25,721 --> 01:35:28,890
to eliminate a giant percentage of 
surgeries that people have.

2256
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:32,300
That's why I didn't know.
I hope so too.

2257
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:37,670
I'm curious is if anybody's a canary in 
the coal mine to you will find that only

2258
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:40,880
time I get.
Well I want to live.

2259
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:41,800
I want,
I want deadly.

2260
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:42,643
I'm going to beat.
And so you just want to deadlift till 

2261
01:35:44,901 --> 01:35:46,180
you drop.
Yeah,

2262
01:35:46,190 --> 01:35:47,140
that's what I do.
I don't know.

2263
01:35:47,150 --> 01:35:47,983
Anything else?

2264
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:51,483
Well,
is there anything else you want to say 

2265
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:54,200
to all the people listening out here 
and.

2266
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:55,930
No,
just no,

2267
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:58,670
just good luck and don't be afraid to 
try,

2268
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:00,140
you know,
keep trying and never give up.

2269
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,750
People give up man and give up and no 
one should give up.

2270
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,153
Well listen man,
you are a very unique character and I 

2271
01:36:06,801 --> 01:36:10,480
really appreciate you taking the time to
sit down with me and do this and uh,

2272
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:11,383
I been wanting to talk to you for a long
time and thank you so much for making 

2273
01:36:14,721 --> 01:36:16,970
that machine because that machine has 
helped me so much.

2274
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,013
It built so much strength in my lower 
back and gave me so much relief from a 

2275
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:22,633
lower back issues that I had.
I have one in my studio before I do the 

2276
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:27,770
podcast will tell you I do that fucking 
thing all the time.

2277
01:36:28,130 --> 01:36:29,660
And anybody who's got a lower back 
problem,

2278
01:36:29,661 --> 01:36:30,230
I go,
come on,

2279
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:32,300
come on back and I show them it and I'm 
like this thing,

2280
01:36:32,540 --> 01:36:33,800
get it.
Put it in your garage.

2281
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:35,030
You need one of these.
Yep.

2282
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:36,141
Great.
Well Matt,

2283
01:36:36,141 --> 01:36:38,030
I really appreciate you coming here.
Really appreciate it.

2284
01:36:38,031 --> 01:36:39,950
Thank you very much.
Thank you sir.

2285
01:36:40,310 --> 01:36:40,850
So,

2286
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:42,470

2288
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:45,890
