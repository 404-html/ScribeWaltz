1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:09,400
We might be too hard to talk pretty high.
This is a bad way to start a podcast,

2
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:11,920
but yet we do it this way.
Every time you guys talk about that stuff,

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,280
sometimes it takes about
15 minutes to recover.

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,870
Like once, once the first wave hits you,
you know what she wants from this wall.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,980
And that explained that commercial.
It's kind of explains, yeah,

6
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:27,100
explains why they ramble. Uh, this,

7
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:30,730

14
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:57,180
And all supplements were also brought
to you today by hover and hover is,

15
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,310
um,
a hover is a domain name company that's a,

16
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:03,130
that's owned by the same
people that own ting. And, uh,

17
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,650
we're big fans of Ting Ting became uh,

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:09,170
one of the few podcast
sponsors that we have. And uh,

19
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,020
when they told us they were trying to
use their non evil company approach

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,880
towards domain name sales,

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,380
we thought that was a great idea
is Yoshi loves banana bread.com.

22
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,214
Has Anybody got that?

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,520
You know what somebody did somebody,
you know what I was joking around when

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,780
day about suck my cock fatty.com somebody
took that and registered it and made a

25
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,040
mirror of my website.

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,030
So now if you go to suck my
cock fatty.com it's my website,

27
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:40,390
which is hilarious, but all that
could have been done through hover,

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,020
hover a offers a lot of a cool software
to use and they offer a lot of cool

29
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:53,740
things that are free like a
who is privacy protection, um,

30
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,140
sub domains,
a URL forwarding,

31
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:00,370
all that stuff that should be included
with the domain name management.

32
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:04,540
They include that for, it's
all that's all free. And uh,

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,720
I think that's just indicative of how
they are with Ting and just how they are

34
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,000
period.
If he goes to hover.com Rogan,

35
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,830
you will get a 10% off your domain name
registrations. Right? You dirty bitches.

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,450
Listen, Yo, she's here and David shows
here. We're going to get freaky with this.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:22,661
Oh,

38
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:27,661
well Brian has a show a Thursday night
at the Improv with WHO's on that?

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,290
We got it.

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,260
Joey Diaz.
Duncan Trussell.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,120
Yoshi is going to be there.
Yoshi.

43
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:41,920
And we might even have Tiffany Haddish
and a couple of his nose nickname. No,

44
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,690
what's his name? Yo.

45
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,220

Adam Hunter will be there. Ian
Edwards was, will be there. Who else?

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,920
Is there somebody else going to

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,410
someone else? Yoshi. N N
words. Uh, whatever bitch.

50
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,210
Oh No. Why would you do that? I
don't know. What'd you make up?

51
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:14,230
A famous, that'd be really
cool if he came to freak.

52
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,340
You're such a mass. Uh,
but, uh, anyway, that's a,

53
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,070
this one's in at 10 o'clock at the Ice
House. Someone else is coming. God Damn.

54
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,690
And I can't remember who it
is. Tony Hinchcliffe. No,

55
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,410
no, I dunno. Well I can't,
I can't remember it. So just
cue the music and rescue me.

56
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,850
Wilson experience try by day Joe
Rogan podcast by night all day.

57
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,470
It's not official

58
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,690
until the music starts that who did
that song? Brian did it. Oh, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:54,650
That garage band. This is a fucking
master. He's a garage band master.

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,820
It sucks because I hear it all the time
and like stupid TV shows and commercials

61
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,030
now. Like, like, like one of the rifts in
that song. Oh really? Yeah. And it's like,

62
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,280
ah, it's what the cause it's
a garage band riff. Yeah.

63
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,430
Like there's parts of it that are
just straight up from garage band.

64
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:12,020
I tweak that a little bit.
Yoshi male,

65
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,590
our friend Yoshi is
here. Hey Joe, what's up?

66
00:04:15,591 --> 00:04:17,900
Yosh and brought his friend David Cho,

67
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,050
who insists on relentless asleep.

68
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,030
Relentlessly torturing Yoshi about,
uh, it's pretty fucking good at it.

69
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:30,500
His nickname, this is a strange
nickname, Yoshi. Yoshi male?

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,410
Yes. Why? Why would that,
why would they call you that?

71
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,960
Is there a story to go with this?
Well, for people who do know Yoshi,

72
00:04:38,961 --> 00:04:42,980
they know that he used to work in the
porn business and his currency was porn.

73
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,830
Like if,
if you needed to get tickets to something,

74
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:49,850
like Yoshi knows a lot of athletes and,
and a rock stars and whatever,

75
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:52,370
and he's like, hey, you guys
want some porn? He's just,

76
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,680
he's always there with the box of porn.

77
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,550
And if you've gotten a
box of porn from Yoshi,

78
00:04:58,551 --> 00:05:00,140
you know that sometimes he hide some.

79
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,510
That's true. Do you hide
it in there? Is it like

80
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,580
your way of just like letting
people get Ahold of it? So like,

81
00:05:08,581 --> 00:05:12,510
people who wouldn't ordinarily watch it,
we're like, well, fuck it. I got the DVD.

82
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,710
No one's here but me.
Let's just throw this on right now.

83
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,890
What are you trying to do? I'm trying
to figure out what they're into. And uh,

84
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,190
he likes, you know, he likes it. He
likes to make people uncomfortable. No,

85
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,640
but you know what?
Sometimes even when they're angry,

86
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:26,700
I could tell it's a fake ingredient.
They really liked it. Ooh, really?

87
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,020
It'd be interesting to,

88
00:05:28,021 --> 00:05:30,990
if you could have a cap camera set up
to see how long they watched it before

89
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:35,380
they turned it off. You
know, they're like, this is
disgusting. Get the lube out.

90
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,390
And there's still did a study a while
back where they took men who are

91
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:45,060
homophobic and they showed them,
uh, image, heard about this,

92
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:49,170
guys having sex and they showed
arousal. Oh, I'm really the opposite.

93
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:53,670
I heard that they got, uh, like,
like if a flight or fight response,

94
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:57,030
like they get really like
aggressive and angry. Really? Yeah.

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,130
What I read was that it was penile arousal
was the word that they, there was a,

96
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,360
uh,

97
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,360
a recognized arousal in the males
that were especially homophobic,

98
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,950
like especially angry about gay people
as much more common for them to actually

99
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,280
like Yoshi fighting off gay
thoughts like Yoshi gets aroused.

100
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:20,800
Thinking about a straight male watching.
What did that come from?

101
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,970
Oh, by the way, don't believe
everything you says. All right.

102
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,740
You told me if I'm laying
there. So I, so Yoshi,

103
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,530
you know, like everyone in here watches
porn, you watch, you jerk off to it.

104
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,050
But this, this was this guy's life.
So what, what gets this guy hard?

105
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,010
A guy who like a nine to five job watches
porn from morning till night, right?

106
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,740
Just asses Dicks,
penises and pussy just smashing together,

107
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:54,000
like over and over, over again. And a
lot of the times when I used to call him,

108
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,460
I'm like, Hey, Yo, you want to go get
dinner or something? He'd be like, no,

109
00:06:56,461 --> 00:07:00,110
I gotta finish the tranny porn.
And it was a,

110
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,490
I always thought it was like he
was just fucking with me. Right.

111
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:05,400
But then he's like, it's not this
like niche thing. It's like huge.

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,750
It's our number one seller.
And it always has been. Yeah.

113
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,970
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, wow.
That's what I said. Okay.

114
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:16,540
This is something that people weren't,
they love this shit. Black trainee porn.

115
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,060
It's the hottest thing. Oh
wait, is this like any huge,

116
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,920
the biggest underground and it's huge.
And untalked about, that's crazy.

117
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,050
The number one seller. Even when I work
at the retail sale or in Seattle, um,

118
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:32,230
we have booth and at the end
of the month we do Talia,

119
00:07:32,231 --> 00:07:36,790
which movies sold the most? Top 10. It's
always combination gay or trainings.

120
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,160
Whoa, that's fucking crazy. Female.

121
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,320
Is there, um, a lack of that? Well,

122
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:45,970
there's not a lack of that
stuff on the Internet.

123
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:47,500
It's not like they would
have to purchase it.

124
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,110
Like why are they purchasing
that more than anything else?

125
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:53,840
Is that what the demand is? The
Ma did. It's like a man is Madison

126
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,870
ever trainee love and dudes are there.
What do you think

127
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,870
it is? Because this is what
I think it is. It's so easy,

128
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,353
by the way.
I did.

129
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,000
It's really shocked me that we started
that whole podcast with training sites.

130
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,010
Oh, it's shocking to you. All right, go
ahead. Why not? Why is it shocking to me,

131
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,020
Yoshi male? Not Though we've been talking
about, you know, let's talk about,

132
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,350
you were talking about you don't worry
about it. Alright. So what is your,

133
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,960
my thing is,
it's just,

134
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,450
you know, if you think of the things
that we used to have to jack off to,

135
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:28,320
you know, we're a bit older, like the
Sears catalog and it was just, you know,

136
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,420
if there was someone at your
school that had got a blowjob,

137
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,430
like they were like the
hero, you know, it's like,

138
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,020
like now like eight year old kids are
giving each other blowjobs it's just

139
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,300
talking about Jim Norton. All right,
go ahead. No, I'm, I'm like, Yo,

140
00:08:41,301 --> 00:08:44,550
she's a grown up adult male
that watches porn all day.

141
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:49,200
But think about like a regular kid who
just discovered the internet and his

142
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:53,550
first boner. Like he can already
watch anal and everything. So I think,

143
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,160
I think you do anal,

144
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,970
you get blowjobs,

145
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,700
you have sex with your girlfriend and
you're like 16 and you've already seen and

146
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:03,570
done everything. You're like, what's the
next thing? You know? That's what I think.

147
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:07,050
I Dunno, I might be wrong
on that, but you know, once,

148
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:08,940
okay,

149
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,160
I dunno, you're in that
business. What do you think?

150
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,140
Why do you think it's such a huge thing?

151
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,020
I have a friend in Boston,
professor of evolutionary biology,

152
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:22,750
but he, he did like a research, like full,

153
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,970
very popular body parts
and internet search.

154
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,270
This is according to 100 million
research, um, obvious one,

155
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,300
tit ass feet and penis according
to 100 million research by men.

156
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,350
And according to my friend it,

157
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,460
it's because we're interested in
all the different sexual cues.

158
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,860
It's doesn't make you a gay person.

159
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,640
I think it's part of our competitiveness
like guides, urinating, bathroom,

160
00:09:45,641 --> 00:09:49,180
kind of look over the guy's penis. You
know, it's not a gay thing, I don't think.

161
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,290
Well,
the,

162
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,910
I think part of the idea is also that a
lot of people have these sexual thoughts

163
00:09:54,911 --> 00:09:59,680
about men because they were imprinted
with some sort of sexual experience by a

164
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:03,400
man when they were young, whether it
was molestation or something like that.

165
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,850
Whatever it is, they had some weirdness
that happened with another boy.

166
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,290
And because of that they have, even though
they don't have homosexual thoughts,

167
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,400
they're not homosexual.

168
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:17,200
They stay can still get aroused by the
idea of men or by the idea of doing

169
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:20,110
something you're not supposed to do.
Looking at a guy's cock.

170
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,220
If you fucking shemale is that
gay? Yes. Check this one out.

171
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:28,690
Charities not as gay jerk off to
it. Is that gay? Check this out.

172
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,340
Uh, no, no, no, but it's questionable.
What does that, what do you show him?

173
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,440
Avn. There was a ton of these guys
or they look like a normal guy,

174
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:39,320
but they had the nicest tits
in the whole entire world.

175
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,320
And so like they would pull
up their tits up for girls.

176
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,240
They could just suck on them.
It looks like it.

177
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,310
God, the totally looks like,
yeah. Can that looks like like a,

178
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:52,580
like an older actor guy. Like a regular
looking dude with huge titties. Yeah. So,

179
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,310
but they were everywhere. It just normal
looking blogging here. Kevin Mcdermott.

180
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,930
It's like Dylan Mcdermott with giant tits.
That was amazing. Kathy's been naming.

181
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:07,150
What is that? Is that a new look?
Yeah. There's another one like Danny,

182
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,590
I forget his name is. Uh, do you
know who I'm talking about? Yoshi?

183
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:14,890
He's a short blond hair. I don't remember
the last day. And he's something,

184
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,250
he was another one. Short blonde
hair. Oh, that reminds me. Do you?

185
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,840
I got you a present when I was in
navy and I brought it for you. It's,

186
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,110
it kind of fits this conversation to
you, son of a bitch. What did have,

187
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,220
you can frame it maybe hanging out,

188
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,900
scared, openness. It's, what is this?

189
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,510
It's dudes with the hard
Dick's in their pants. Oh,

190
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,790
let me see if you think you're funny.
Is that what it supposed to be?

191
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:46,200
Funny or underwear? Why you paid money
for this? You really wanted that.

192
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,690
This is one of those things.

193
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,930
Oh, well, if you don't
want it, I'll take it.

194
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,100
I bought it for you drunk the next day.

195
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,270
I was like, why did I buy this
roadshow is silly bitch. That was why,

196
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:01,780
but it's good artwork. He was aroused by
it. Yeah. He was around, I guess he was.

197
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,510
I got a little tingle right in.
They're looking at, if you're not,

198
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,590
he really wanted it for himself, but
while he was purchasing, he's like,

199
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,970
this is from my friend Joe, so it
takes the gayness away from him. Yeah.

200
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,890
If you're gay and you saw
that, you'd be psyched. Yeah.

201
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,990
That's how I thought it was funny.

202
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,210
I thought it was like that
gangster fag shit back in the day.

203
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,600
Got Joe will think this is hilarious.
Do you remember that there was a wrap

204
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,210
burned named Gangsta fag and
he had like, uh, all these uh,

205
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,610
Gangsta rap songs about
having sex with dude.

206
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,800
This shit's huge too. Yeah. In New York.
Have you seen it? Like, no, like homo now?

207
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,570
Yeah.
Like it's like super hardcore gangsters,

208
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,760
but then they like look like gangsters,

209
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:42,560
but they like wear pink and I forgot
what the movement is called, but it's in,

210
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,330
you see it a lot in New York.
Wow.

211
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,370
It's like they're on the subway just
like making out and they're like,

212
00:12:46,371 --> 00:12:50,330
what the fuck you looking at?
And they're like, Holy Shit.

213
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,570
Gangster gay people. I
like it. I'm into it. Yeah.

214
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,390
We need another wrinkle in this society.
There it is.

215
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,123
Yeah.

216
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,040
What we're looking at for the folks
listening on Itunes, this is two,

217
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,080
it's a famous photo of to look,

218
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,830
they'd look Latino gentlemen was tape
Fletcher and gang tattoos and they're in

219
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:19,580
the tub together. Naked. No, no biggie.
Just totally not gay, just alive today.

220
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,950
Apparently that's in the Latino
community. In prison. It's a big thing.

221
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:28,951
It's gay for the stay for this day that
a lot of dudes gay when they're inside

222
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,720
and then when they get outside it's
like just shut up about it. Wow. Yeah.

223
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,940
Well I want to ask you
about that because you,

224
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,700
you do all the UFC stuff like
sometimes, you know. Okay,

225
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:44,000
so UFC starts right. And it was
like tank Abbott. There was like,

226
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,570
it was more like street fighter back then
there was like a sumo guy with like a

227
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:51,630
boxer and then at some point it all
went straight to like grappling. Right.

228
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,600
So on any given UFC fight,
if you just walk into the room,

229
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,720
all the fights playing, most of the
fights end up on the floor. Right?

230
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,590
A lot of them do. Yeah. Less
now I think then then more,

231
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,660
right. And then they're
wearing the, uh, you know,

232
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,670
the tight short shorts with a bone or
bulges and there is a lot of 69 going on.

233
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,380
There's a lot of like head to crotch
grinding. It looks very homoerotic.

234
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,970
You could if you were in and

235
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,170
two gay dudes and viewer in to dudes,
especially if you were an athletic dudes,

236
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,490
I would totally see how you
could see, uh, two men grappling,

237
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,770
especially bare chest to bare chest as
being a homoerotic and just as you there,

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,860
I mean people, but it's really
based upon your sexual preference.

239
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,000
If you're into that. Yeah, you
would think that's homoerotic,

240
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,720
but if you're not, it's not, you know
what I'm saying? If you're not gay,

241
00:14:43,721 --> 00:14:46,690
it's just two dudes fighting. Right.
If you are gay, you'd be psyched.

242
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,350
Maybe you can enjoy it on another
level. Like you, it would be like,

243
00:14:50,351 --> 00:14:51,740
not just fighting,

244
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:55,550
but fighting with like too hot dudes that
you're like really getting excited by

245
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,330
it. So you're getting excited by the fight
itself and you get excited by the fact

246
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,060
that you would like to suck both
their cocks after it's over.

247
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,640
Thank them for the show.
Yeah. I mean, you know,

248
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:09,950
sometimes you know this move at the
Strip club when you go and the girl like

249
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,410
gives you a simulated blowjob,

250
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,300
like she's blowing your budget
using the top of her head. Yeah,

251
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,220
I seen that in the UFC move,

252
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:19,010
like the guys like grinding his forehead
on the guy's crotch it. I'm like,

253
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,410
Oh fuck a stripper just did
that to me. Yeah, the head job,

254
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,330
you wouldn't want that if you
had a big heart cup on though.

255
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,740
It doesn't feel as good. You want
like sweat pants. That's true.

256
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,021
I knew it dude.

257
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:37,280
Who used to take a those nylon sweat
pants and you know the nylon sweatpants.

258
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:41,390
That dude's used to wear the joggers
back in the nineties remember those blue

259
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:43,040
nylon sweatpants people used to wear?

260
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,110
He took those and he sanded it with
thousand grit sandpaper and the crotch.

261
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,311
Who would get it?

262
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:53,390
Like he could hold it up to the light
and see his fingers and then he would

263
00:15:53,391 --> 00:15:56,020
squirt lube.
He's shaved his cock and ball.

264
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,940
Complete complete shave or like
where the store is going to score it.

265
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:01,160
Lube all over himself,

266
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,760
put his sweatpants on and then he would
go to the Strip club and it was called

267
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,210
shooting. Who goes shooting. Oh.

268
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,320
And the girls would sit down and we give
him a lap dance and essentially he's

269
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,790
wearing a condom. Wow. How can advance,

270
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,070
I said, that's pretty clever.
You know, he's a very smart guy.

271
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,970
I used to live at the Strip club pretty
much in Vegas and nobody figured that

272
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:26,600
out there. Like me and my
friend Harry, when we'd go,

273
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,690
we'd take our genes off and
like put on sweatpants. Right.

274
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,600
Someone new to our group would be like,
what are you guys doing? We're like, dude,

275
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:36,580
we're about to get lap dances, but this,
this takes that to the whole other level.

276
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,620
Dude brought out grinding down.
That's fucking awesome.

277
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:43,700
Without sandpaper to the point where
the shit was like almost transparent.

278
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,950
He was using like 1500 grit,

279
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:50,090
which is like what you would use to
gently clean off the shaft of a pool cue.

280
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:52,790
You know what,
I'm that kind of dust,

281
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,980
just a slight level of dust
every [inaudible] basis.

282
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,580
This is so amazing. He, uh,

283
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,100
he wore that shit down where he could
get his fingers so he could see his

284
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,780
fingers in the light.
That's when he knew,

285
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,600
like he was technically still
close with was this guy,

286
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,820
this guy's name happened to
be Yoshi [inaudible] clever.

287
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:15,290
This guy was a very smart dude. I
won't give his name, but uh, he, uh,

288
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,410
it's like, and it's imperative that
you shave the cock and balls. She goes,

289
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:20,600
you want to have no hair,
no hair anywhere. Yeah.

290
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,590
Like an old technique to everything.
It's fantastic. And then he's like,

291
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,820
then you go Astroglide but then one time,

292
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,590
I guess he put on too much Astroglide
and a girl got on his lap, but she goes,

293
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:35,380
what the fuck the fuck is this? And
he was like, Oh yeah, I'm sorry.

294
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:39,760
She was, what are you doing? What are
you doing? I couldn't believe that just,

295
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,570
and I said, he got caught. He was
horrified. Please. Well, you know,

296
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:46,970
he basically took it too far.
He wasn't,

297
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,080
he just wearing the nylon and you got
the lube on underneath and she really

298
00:17:52,081 --> 00:17:56,280
probably can't tell at first,
but he like had a puddle in his pants.

299
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,930
He tried to get crafty,

300
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,980
but he's tried to make a monument
to this guy every strip club.

301
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,540
Well for a long time.

302
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,260
Like he goes when he had his own business
and he was really dedicated to his

303
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:12,030
business, very hard on paper business.
He was selling shooting pants.

304
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,220
He uh, he, he had this business and so
he didn't have any time for, for dating.

305
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,020
So what he would do is he would go and
work all fucking day on his own business.

306
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,820
Then he would eat dinner,
he would order, take out,

307
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,730
then he would go to the Strip club and
his shooting pants and he would have the

308
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,960
ritual get one off and
then he'd go back home.

309
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,800
And that's what he would do every day,
whenever you want, whenever you want it.

310
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,490
And that was how he avoided relationships.
For the longest time. I would just go,

311
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,780
he would go shoot it cause he was just,

312
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,220
he had a few bad relationships and he
got fucked over. What does it checks?

313
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,000
He was in his 30s smart
guy and he just was like,

314
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,990
he was very logical to his approach to
solving problems. Where's he at now?

315
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,920
I haven't talked to him in a long time.
I don't know. Can I ask you a question?

316
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:56,400
Sure.

317
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,280
So I just walked in here and you guys
have all these sex at dawn books and like

318
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,630
I read that too, cause I'm interested
in human sexuality and all that stuff,

319
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,920
especially the shemale stuff.
So when I look at you,

320
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,760
I see like the last of
a dying breed of man,

321
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,690
like sort of like the intellectual jock.
Like you're like,

322
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,090
you're like a pretty big guy that
can beat the shit out of people,

323
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,730
but you're also like,
well read intelligent.

324
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,260
So what is your whole take on all
this? Like do you, are you married?

325
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,500
Do you have a girlfriend? I'm
married. Oh you are? I'm married.

326
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,580
I have kids and everything. I have
the whole deal. That's, you know,

327
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,460
it is crazy.
And we are for a long time.

328
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,380
I've been married for quite a
few years now. But for me, um,

329
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,220
the, the difference that happens when
you, uh, when you have kids, right,

330
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,910
is so hard to wrap your head around.

331
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,670
Like for anybody that's not
married and doesn't have kids.

332
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,900
Once you have like a little,

333
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:56,901
you a great day running around like the
love that you have for them is so it's

334
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,640
really, you could never imagine
that it would even be possible.

335
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,340
So it's a real mind fuck went.
How old are your kids?

336
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,430
I have a 16 year old stepdaughter.

337
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,000
I have a four year old and a two year old.
Well the fours,

338
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:13,950
almost five the two songs, three
pretty major. Unbelievably fascinating.

339
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,490
And cupcake over here. Who's about 30
Oh, so when I hear, when I hear it,

340
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,480
you're like, okay, here's like
the married path with like kids.

341
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,820
And then here's the other
path with the shooting pants.

342
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:28,020
Like I aimed more towards the shirt and
pants. You know what man? Shooting pants.

343
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,740
If the whole deal is finding
a compatible person, right?

344
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:33,360
If you don't find a compatible person,

345
00:20:33,361 --> 00:20:36,600
you find somebody wants to fight all
the time, find someone to test you,

346
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,600
find someone who's not
at peace themselves,

347
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,120
you're going to have fucking problems.

348
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,490
Can always find something wrong with
people. Yeah. But as a, you know,

349
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,340
a man who probably gets hit on by chicks,
the time those fucking

350
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,390
ring girls are super smoking hot. Like
I mean, how do you deal with that?

351
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,500
Jerk off, keep it together, do your best.

352
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,900
I know a great guy that
has immense collection of
shemale porn that I could hook

353
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:02,070
you up

354
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,903
with.

355
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,440
The idea of caring hard porn is
so ridiculous these days with the,

356
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,570
all the websites. It does the industry
frown upon the websites. They look at it.

357
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,620
Other people look at,
do you know he's told me laying,

358
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,690
do you know what the uh,
that there's still,

359
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,860
they still print video
cassettes and like the VHS,

360
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,500
like I don't know anyone who buys
porn except stuff for myself.

361
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,250
But for in general, I don't know one
person who ever buys pornography,

362
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:34,270
like DVDs even has like a porn
pass or any of that stuff.

363
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,040
And so Yoshi educated me
that he said that the last,

364
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,990
the thing that keeps this business
alive is people like 50 and over.

365
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,810
All pervert. Yeah. They're
scared to use computers.

366
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:51,670
So they still go to the store and they
buy DVDs and VHS tapes and then once

367
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,300
their debt

368
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,730
dead,
then this business will be dead.

369
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:58,990
So the old perverts who just stuck
with their ways, they have this way,

370
00:21:58,991 --> 00:22:02,350
they liked the remote control to liked
to be able to sit there on the bed.

371
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,960
There are also prayed the government
might get them, they're probably right.

372
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,370
You know, because there's no, you know,
there's nothing of it on their computer.

373
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,253
So

374
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,350
cause you're,

375
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:17,130
you're trusting the companies that every
one of those girls are 18 and older.

376
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,300
It's a funny thing man. But if someone
who is in a high position of power,

377
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,590
like say a political person and they
found that they had tranny porn at their

378
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:27,630
house, even though it's
totally legal. Right.

379
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:30,600
And even know you're saying
it's the biggest market.

380
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,520
So it represents a lot of human beings
that are into that stuff. You'd be done,

381
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,910
right? Yeah, for sure. How
weird is that? Why, why is,

382
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,440
how weird is it that we give a fuck about,

383
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,790
like Jimmy Norton is a very good friend
of mine. I love that. I love that guy.

384
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,760
I don't care that he jerks
off to trainings at all.

385
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,280
It doesn't bother me that
he's had training experiences.

386
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,720
It's Hilarious when he tells you about it,
like the,

387
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,270
the fact that you would judge what
tweaks someone sexually wants,

388
00:22:57,271 --> 00:23:00,590
what the heart wants.
But it's complete like that.

389
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:03,890
It's a weird sort of homophobia
that still accepted. It's,

390
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,760
it's a weird sort of prejudice that's
still accepted that your sexual preference

391
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,200
and even if you're a nice person,

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,330
even though you're nice and you
know you're intelligent, we'll,

393
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,680
we'll judge you based on whether or
not you jerk off to dudes with dicks or

394
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,850
dudes or looks like chicks with dicks.

395
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,980
I remember even lady the late eighties
that stolen or didn't want to have

396
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:26,430
interracial tapes, thinking most of
the customer in Seattle, we hate it.

397
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,090
But the reaction once we've got
the interracial stuff is opposite.

398
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,920
It's always the white doctors, white
lawyers. Why Cpa? Yeah. You know,

399
00:23:34,921 --> 00:23:38,520
so well, the disproportionate
amount of interracial porn,

400
00:23:38,521 --> 00:23:42,420
it's sold in the deep south. Oh,
utilize like number one poor market.

401
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,070
It's white dudes, white dudes watching
black guys. Fuck white girls. Yeah.

402
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,950
That couple films him,
it, yeah, those are weird.

403
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,810
But that's something I didn't see
comment. The, the cold market. If folks,

404
00:23:56,811 --> 00:24:00,370
if you're normal and you're listening
to this and you're not all fucked up in

405
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:01,131
the head like us,

406
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:04,850
where we can just say caught cold and no
one has to worry whether or not anybody

407
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:06,080
understands what it means.

408
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,700
Apparently there's a group of dudes
who like watching other guys fuck their

409
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:14,000
women. Yeah, yeah. And they like,

410
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,880
especially like big black guys.
So what is it called?

411
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:19,280
The Mandingo clove or something.

412
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,550
There's a lot to bring like seven
men dingoes it's like, like,

413
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,930
it's like just this black crew of
like guys with dicks like you know,

414
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,430
over 12 inches. Whoa. And they just
come and be like, fuck the sure.

415
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:36,050
12 inches. Just stop and think
about that. It's not just one dude.

416
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:40,340
There's like many guys with dicks over
12 inches out. That's like a horse race.

417
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,550
I think the vice guys made an
awesome documentary about it shortly.

418
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,830
It's do is a big Dick. It's just
specifically about the cook hold stuff.

419
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,750
It's cold from Mandingo goes Oh.
Like it's a mandate ago.

420
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,940
I didn't,
I didn't even know that was a,

421
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,280
I thought man didn't go was
just the name of a porn star.

422
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:02,290
But I guess it's a whole movement.
I think. I thought, I thought,

423
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:07,280
I think the slave owners had a one prize
black guy in each farm and did I think

424
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:10,210
they call them Mandingo. I think
that's where it started. It real. Yeah.

425
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:14,090
So you can go to this and get your
wife man didn't go, oh my God,

426
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:17,790
that's fucking insane thinking about it.
No,

427
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,170
I don't think Mrs Rog and I
appreciate that. Um, yeah,
we should probably wouldn't.

428
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:26,000
I don't want to know.
That's really what it's about.

429
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,000
I see Joe going to one of those parties
where you are wearing masks, you know,

430
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,710
but I wear a Batman mask,
white porcelain bullshit.

431
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,340
If you make me marijuana mask
and it'd be Batman. But the,

432
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,360
when I did Dave show, we were talking
about David tells a porn show.

433
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,390
Thanks for doing it. But that
was fine. It was a lot of fun.

434
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,230
Yoshi works on that show. But when I
did it and we were looking at John Home,

435
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:52,700
so like his dick ain't even big by
today's standards. Like it's Kinda crazy.

436
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:54,990
Like he was the guy who
had the big giant cock.

437
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,720
Now there's so many black guys with
Dick's way bigger than John Holmes. Well,

438
00:25:59,721 --> 00:26:02,900
they weren't allowed. They weren't
allowed in the porn back then. That's why.

439
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,040
Is that what it is? I think
so. Yeah. I'm, I'm matching.

440
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:07,160
So people had to get
tired of white people,

441
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,230
fucking white women where they're like,
listen,

442
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:13,430
we've got a million videos of white
girls getting fucked by white guys with

443
00:26:13,431 --> 00:26:17,060
three quarter heart deck. Okay.
Can we bring in some brothers?

444
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,380
And then they're like, okay, we'll just
try this out and see how it works. Boom.

445
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:24,320
Smash hit big black
dudes with giant Dicks,

446
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:27,560
fucking white girls and just changes.
And for girls,

447
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,390
like that's like part of their currency,
right?

448
00:26:29,391 --> 00:26:32,420
That they haven't had interracially
like that's like that.

449
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,060
That helps them sell at a
lot of markets, right? Yeah.

450
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:38,300
Full a full lot of their stars. They,
that their manager would tell them,

451
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:41,150
don't do it.
Well you could charge more money.

452
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,310
I've talked to extensively
just started in my podcast

453
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:47,820
with also a carer who just won
2012 what is it podcast called?

454
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,380
All right,

455
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:53,070
so just like for the same audience out
there that doesn't know what cook hold is.

456
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,300
The name of the podcast is DVD,
a s a n.

457
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,090
It's all the podcasts or a DVD,
a s a.com.

458
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:04,980
But basically this is a pretty much all
I talked to us about because I was like,

459
00:27:04,981 --> 00:27:07,650
is that true? When you fuck a black
dude then your rate goes down.

460
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,790
And that was actually sort of a
myth. But the shit now, so DVD,

461
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:16,410
asa stands for double Vatche,
double anal, a sensitive artist.

462
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,253
So

463
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,170
also always gets pissed cause
she's like Dave get it straight.

464
00:27:24,171 --> 00:27:28,520
I didn't do DVD cause if you do DVD a
then it's for Dick's at the same time.

465
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,550
She said I did DV break and
then at another time I did da.

466
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,510
Yeah. So that's two dicks in your
ass at once. And it's like, you know,

467
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:43,400
it's medically dangerous. I mean she can't
sit for like a week after that. I mean,

468
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:47,090
it's like really? Yeah. It's like we were,
we were, we just grilled her about this.

469
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:50,770
It's, and the thing is, why does she
do that? She's a little, you know,

470
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:54,260
she's five feet two. Yeah.
There's like, there's like the,

471
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,280
Yoshi knows more about porn than I do,
but for what I know,

472
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,970
most of the girls that do this are
usually like ugly and Noni and porn stars.

473
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,050
So for someone like asa who has a huge
name to do it, it's like, it's like, whoa.

474
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,640
Like, and she's tiny, you know? Why
is she doing it? Because it's, well,

475
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,080
check out insatiable to Joe. You'll,
I'll explain it to you. I went, I went,

476
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:19,130
I went with her to the porn awards.
Insatiable.

477
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,150
I went with her to the porn awards
last year and she won best anal,

478
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,620
best double penetration to two
years in a row. So I was like,

479
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,760
you know, after the thing, you know, it
was a, it's a weird thing to celebrate,

480
00:28:31,761 --> 00:28:35,350
you know? Right. Cause this
is like, you're the best,
but fucky right. You're the,

481
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,980
you got, but fuck the best out of
anyone this year. You're right,

482
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:44,100
you got penetrated. Oh my
God, I'm so happy for you.
Oh my God, you won the award.

483
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,510
That's amazing. Yeah. But you know, I love
her. So I'm like sitting there and, um,

484
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,430
I think I'm just like,

485
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,240
there's not a huge success
rate for porn stars after porn.

486
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,230
Right.
Like,

487
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,530
it's like you either got a bag of rich
dude or you got to get out before it just

488
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:04,880
completely destroys your soul
and it's too late. I mean,

489
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,570
yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
And I saw a documentary about it.

490
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,760
[inaudible] porn. Yeah. How was that?

491
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,570
I just saw the first 20 minutes and
it was like super sad and I was like,

492
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,040
oh yeah, I know. And I was like,
you're at the top right now.

493
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,750
You won the fucking,

494
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:23,180
she was walking out of here like this
with like all the awards. I was like,

495
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:25,940
you want everything this
year and last year. Right.

496
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:30,080
And like you fucking dis like for,
I'm trying to tell her to quit.

497
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,920
I'm not trying to totally
equipment like start like,

498
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,710
like if a porn star one performer of
the year, like 10 years ago. Right.

499
00:29:36,711 --> 00:29:39,920
That means she was like really
sexy and like did sexy shit.

500
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:45,220
Like if win performer of the year now
in 2012 2013 that means you took dicks

501
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:50,230
like brutally, like you're like slang,
like like a fucking bag of dicks.

502
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:51,670
Like just giving them

503
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:55,620
wars and saying good job and so these
girls are working towards these,

504
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,430
you watch these. They don't,
they look like snuff films. Yeah,

505
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,310
they all like getting dragged across
the ground and throwing against the wall

506
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:05,850
and like, it's like Caveman Shit. Hearst
Hearst. If he checked out insatiable,

507
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:09,660
which I know is not going to do any more
insatiables as an example in Saint Paul,

508
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:14,300
she's getting dragged by her hair down
there and just pretty much gagged and it

509
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,230
does. It looks like a snake. It looks
like rape or something horrible.

510
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,740
Why are people into that?
That's what people want.

511
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,830
There's two things people want now,
like shit like that. It's a parody.

512
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:23,490
It's a thing.

513
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,730
The the, the shemale stuff. It's
like they've already seen everything.

514
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,520
What's the next thing? And it's
funny you said, what is next?

515
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:30,510
Are you going to have to fucking animals.

516
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,780
You can get your head chopped off
in the next one. Yeah. You know,

517
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,090
what is she saying? I
she, she's one of the,

518
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:40,080
one of the girls that genuinely loves
porn. Like she loves being, she's like,

519
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:42,360
and that's why a lot of the fans like her,
cause she's not like,

520
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,240
oh I'm just going to do this until
I get my real estate license.

521
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,410
Like she loves it. So she sent a rough
sex. She loves fucking, she loves it now.

522
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,660
So she's amazing. She is. She is
amazing. I love her. I love her too.

523
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,450
It's a funny thing that people would like,
you know,

524
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,560
the natural instinct is to go, Oh God,
what the fuck are you guys talking about?

525
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:04,770
She's amazing. She's taking two dicks
in her house. Oh my God. He's amazing.

526
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,040
But the reality is porn is something
that a fucking lot of people watch,

527
00:31:11,071 --> 00:31:13,380
but nobody gives anybody
credit for being good at it.

528
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,860
Oh, I mean, that's the other thing
too is like, he's right about that

529
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,920
because you look,

530
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:21,070
we've all had bad sexual experiences
where someone wasn't into it.

531
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,110
That girl was like, oh,
you know, and you're like,

532
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,680
and you know you're losing your erection,
right? She's like, what's wrong? I'm like,

533
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,210
what the Fuck's wrong with you?

534
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:32,650
Like I'm kind of a confrontation that
we have in here. This is nuts. So you,

535
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,570
what you see like on a,

536
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:39,571
in a scene when a girl is like really
into getting fucked or the reality of it

537
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:43,570
like gets you excited. Right?
But if someone's sucks at it,

538
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,340
it's not good. Or if all seen bad porn,
I mean, there's a lot of porn out there.

539
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:49,360
It's not all good.

540
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,270
And usually the hot chicks, you know,
they don't fuck like, Ugh, ugly fat girls,

541
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:57,140
you know? So when you have a hot chick
that does fuck like, you know, fat,

542
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:59,280
ugly chick, then it's
like amazing. You know?

543
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,250
And she's amazing because she's done
scenes where gang bangs, bunch of guys,

544
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,330
and I know half of those guys didn't
take a bath. Oh. And she'll smile.

545
00:32:08,331 --> 00:32:12,640
And just do it like professionally
random strangers. That's the other thing.

546
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,800
[inaudible] porn.
So these guys are hoping they doing that.

547
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,780
You don't want that to Mike
to be that close to his mouth.

548
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:21,520
Cause that's the other thing we figured
out. The podcast is pretty much me,

549
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,530
Yoshi and asa and all this dude does
is eat acid out of hookers and Austin,

550
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,530
she, she eats a lot of acid. Like no,

551
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,240
she said a lot of those guys don't
shower and stuff. So I'm like,

552
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,270
I'm on a show with two people
that he'd asked and all day,

553
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,410
don't get pink eye from this mic are you
probably have a good immune system of

554
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,244
that.

555
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,300
Your immune system is doing
battle all. Yo, she's aids.

556
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,820
I'm glad. I'm glad you
said that. It about me.

557
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,450
Well Yoshi and Brian's
aids in the same room.

558
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,390
What they are is like two competing
beehives and they're fucking,

559
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,530
they're hovering in the middle of the
room trying to work the situation out.

560
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,260
Yeah. Your shorts tells guy
who's aids dominates this room.

561
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,450
You can only get it once.
Right now you get twice.

562
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,110
We had this guy on and uh, I have to
tell people, listen to this podcast,

563
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:13,790
we have found a molecular biologist
to debate Dr Peter Duesberg.

564
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,060
We had this guy on the podcast and a
lot of people got really angry at me.

565
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,720
He's a professor of biology at the
University of California Berkeley and he's

566
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:25,370
got this crazy theory about HIV and aids
and he doesn't believe that HIV causes

567
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:25,671
AIDS.

568
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:30,170
He believes that the drugs that people
give people for Hiv there what really is

569
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:31,004
going on with these people's,

570
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,310
they have a compromised immune system
from drug use and you're giving them a

571
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,770
drug that's designed to kill a
disease that they don't even,

572
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,140
it's not even the cause of their illness.

573
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,930
He's saying that caused the illness is
the fact that they're taking all these

574
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:46,430
drugs and the people
that are in HIV research,

575
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,350
they think he's fucking crazy.

576
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:51,500
And a lot of people got mad at us for
having them on [inaudible] and it's a

577
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,980
controversial situation because
obviously he's smarter than me. I don't,

578
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,370
I'm not a professor of biology and
he's got tenure and he does like peer

579
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:02,540
reviewed stuff on, on, on cancer. That's
very well respected like to this day.

580
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,450
But he's got this wacky opinion on,

581
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:10,100
on an HIV and you know, he insists
that no one wants to debate them.

582
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:13,880
So we got this guy who was finally willing
to debate them and I'll announce all

583
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:17,360
of it when everything gets signed away
and we figured out what day they're going

584
00:34:17,361 --> 00:34:18,290
to both fly in.

585
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:22,310
But we're going to bring him in here and
we're going to have them debate as long

586
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,840
as it takes on the podcast and either,
you know,

587
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,950
either Duesberg is fucking crazy or
do's Burges at genius and we have a real

588
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:33,620
problem with the way people perceive
this one particular disease.

589
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,030
I don't fucking know.

590
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,600
I'm just hoping that I can figure out
how to navigate through the waters cause

591
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,630
I'm basically going to be like a referee
in a contest that I don't understand.

592
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:45,260
Right. But, uh, you know, with
aids besides Brian and Yoshi,

593
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,760
well they have the most days, but
uh, yeah, I know a guy was HIV.

594
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,680
I know at least one guy.
The only,

595
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:55,820
the only time in my life that I've ever
seen anyone with aids and it was like a

596
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:58,160
lot,
a lot of aids was when I was in Africa.

597
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:01,760
Like that's like that was part
of Duisburg problem with it.

598
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,790
And he said that what you're seeing
in Africa is not people that have HIV.

599
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:07,820
It's people that have no,
no nutrition. He's like,

600
00:35:07,821 --> 00:35:09,930
you're seeing compromised
immune systems because they're,

601
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:13,340
they're starving and they're,
they're in horrible climates.

602
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:17,360
Where there's a lot of waste around a
lot is you're seeing a lot of different

603
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,690
things. He's like, they're not testing
these people for HIV. He goes, and the,

604
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,700
the amount of people that they have
tested that, that do have HIV in Africa,

605
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,620
he said the number hasn't increased,

606
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,860
but the population has tripled
the population of Africa.

607
00:35:30,861 --> 00:35:33,980
They were saying it's going to be
decimated by AIDS. And he was like, well,

608
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:34,820
if that's the truth,

609
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:39,690
why the population increased by
three preparation was like, he said,

610
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:42,960
it was like, this is all Duesberg,
I'm paraphrasing, but he said,

611
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:47,610
I believe it was like 500 million and
now it's over a billion. So he was like,

612
00:35:47,611 --> 00:35:51,570
the population tripled. They got 12
inch dicks. They look the fuck. Yeah.

613
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,110
Well the idea is that if aids
was a communicable disease,

614
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,460
like people are describing it,

615
00:35:56,461 --> 00:36:00,390
it would have swept through Africa
and decimated the population.

616
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,230
And he's saying because it didn't, not
even by any stretch of the imagination,

617
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,513
he said it's,

618
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:10,440
it backs up his idea that it's something
that's brought a bond and in Africa by

619
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:14,640
poor nutrition in America, by
drug use. I don't know man.

620
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:17,820
I know gay dudes love to party and
that's something that can't be ignored.

621
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,210
They fucking love to party.
And it could be a combination of them.

622
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:25,560
Loving to party makes them
more susceptible to certain
diseases and illnesses.

623
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,930
But we all know that I have,

624
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,250
I have a friend who they, they, you know,

625
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,220
they're married and
they're, you know, they're,

626
00:36:34,221 --> 00:36:38,580
they're gay folks and they have
a total normal married life,

627
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,910
but they also have friends who are
gay that they talk about their,

628
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,520
their buddies that they party with.
And these guys are fucking savages.

629
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,230
When you get a direct line into how
gays and these are gay professional men.

630
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:54,230
I mean one guy,
yeah,

631
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,050
one guy owns a clothing company and
he's really rich. And another guy,

632
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,020
he owned some other business and he,
uh,

633
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:04,260
he actually pays a straight
guy and had sex with him.

634
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,920
He's like got the straight Russian
guy that, uh, that he paid.

635
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:12,390
Like the guy was like broke working at
a bar and so for paying him for sex and

636
00:37:12,391 --> 00:37:15,270
he fucks has got a regular button up.
So now it bought this guy car,

637
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,990
puts a guy up in an apartment and just
goes and bangs them and they go out and

638
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:23,991
they fucking party hard party hard man.

639
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,270
And it might be just be this
guy's buddies, but you know,

640
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:30,600
when I meet these dudes and they start
telling me stories about the fucking,

641
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,580
the throw downs that they
all have together, wow,

642
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,550
they fucking go out and do crazy drugs.
You know,

643
00:37:36,551 --> 00:37:41,310
they're in this dance culture all the
time and they love to take ecstasy and

644
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:44,220
they get together and you know,
snorting coke,

645
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,530
that's a part of what they're doing.
That's fun.

646
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,860
And that shit will decimate
your immune system.

647
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:55,470
Whether or not dues Berg's correct about
all of his assumptions about aids that

648
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,120
outside of,

649
00:37:57,121 --> 00:38:00,510
let's set that aside for a minute and
just look at the fact that there's so many

650
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,630
of these dudes taking those drugs and
that those drugs will fuck you up.

651
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,260
That is a fact.
Whether or not HIV causes AIDS,

652
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,590
the majority of scientists say it does.
So I have to go with them.

653
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,870
I mean the majority support,

654
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:17,700
the idea that it's this ever
altering and changing disease,

655
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:20,920
it's very hard to figure out. And then
it decimates immune system if they,

656
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,710
I don't imagine that you could keep
something like that a secret if it wasn't

657
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:28,910
true. So having him on was, um,

658
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,680
it was a tricky thing
because I can't debate him.

659
00:38:31,681 --> 00:38:34,860
And I had my friend Brian Callin on,
he tried to debate him but he got smushed.

660
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,060
Right. Cause you gotta
have another genius. Yeah.

661
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,580
You're going to have another gene.
Yeah. So we're doing that. So that's,

662
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:42,970
that's coming up. I'm going to keep hope
alive that there's a cure for you buddy.

663
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,900
No, Yoshi is AIDS isn't curable. It's and
get his own. Yeah, it's its own thing.

664
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,620
It's like a fingerprint. Sorry Bro.
And that's like fucking with my aides,

665
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,290
it'd be like King Kong versus Godzilla.

666
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,310
You could get a film camera in there and
make a cartoon reenactment of what they

667
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,910
say. He would just see aids
doing battle with aids.

668
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,210
The dressed up like gladiators
from a scene of Lord of the rings,

669
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:12,070
just just ogre aids and on the other
side of troll aids and they have fucking

670
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:17,070
shields on, on their chest and battering
rams and they're going to war inside.

671
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,830
Yo, she's asked somebody make that cartoon
but you just got to throw that mic out

672
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:24,200
after this feels though. Yo
should, we will spray it.

673
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,710
I'm going to let you know fill this.
Don't feel sad.

674
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:31,180
We're going to spray it because I saw a
few of those spittles they flew off your

675
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:31,481
mouth.

676
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:35,230
Why you got really particularly excited
about things and that's like Panspermia.

677
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:38,860
That's how like asteroids hit other
planets and that's how life gets to earth.

678
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:43,180
I see. So your aids leap
frogging onto that, you know,

679
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,360
very moist sponge microphone cover.

680
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,700
That's like perfect
habitat for super aids.

681
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,100
I just want to make sure they were just
joking. I don't have a cause I'm just,

682
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,320
I can't believe I have to tone down
your fucking professional comedian.

683
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,390
Jesus Christ. Guess what? Brian
doesn't have aids either. Wink, wink.

684
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,560
That's the other shit is like, are
you guys are on iTunes? Yeah. Yeah.

685
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:09,130
We're on iTunes.

686
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:12,700
But see like we just started our shit
and we talk about like aids and rape like

687
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,770
every like how the fuck are you

688
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:16,780
all right? Did you start talking about
poop? Well, there's nothing wrong with it.

689
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,830
You know w what, what, what we're saying,
we didn't say we didn't advocate rape,

690
00:40:20,831 --> 00:40:24,310
we didn't advocate anybody getting dragged
away by their hair or mouth fucked.

691
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,920
We're just like, it's a real,
it's educational podcast.

692
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,640
It's very much an educational part.

693
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,620
I'm surprised where in comedy
and the comedy section.

694
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:37,810
Well see that's what like we didn't
write in our description like it's DVD a

695
00:40:37,941 --> 00:40:42,530
asa, but we didn't, right. It's double
vaginal, double anal, whatever. And so,

696
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,060
you know, my manager is like, dude,

697
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,390
you could have a porn star on there
and you have this fucking guy.

698
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,830
Like do you want ever to have non
porn star guests? Like real guests on?

699
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:56,390
Really you'll have normal guests. Well
we have this currency now. Like for me,

700
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,660
I haven't painted in a while and like
my paintings have gone like, you know,

701
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:05,000
like ridiculously expensive. So I could
paint yes. To bribe them to come on.

702
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,480
And then also said last May and she
said she'll blow anyone who comes on our

703
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:12,710
show. Really? Yeah. And she was, and
she said, it's like, so like not joking,

704
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,930
like whatever,

705
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,910
can I come? That's, that's, see,

706
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,650
that's what keeps hope alive.

707
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,660
It's good currency to have
you here and things like that.

708
00:41:22,661 --> 00:41:25,240
That is excellent current. So, you know,
people would go on your show anyway,

709
00:41:25,241 --> 00:41:27,600
period. You know, why would they
not want to go on? I don't know.

710
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,570
They don't want their career destroyed.
So silly in this day and age,

711
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:36,190
people are silly. Gotta they gotta relax.
Just be who the fuck you are. You know?

712
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,480
And especially in a podcast form is the
best place for that because you get a

713
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:44,720
chance to express yourself for hours.
Definitely.

714
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,620
It's not like if you said
something fucked up and then like,

715
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,600
remember when Hugh grant got blown by
that hooker and got arrested and went on

716
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:54,520
the tonight show and Jay Atlanta goes,
what the hell were you thinking? Right,

717
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:54,830
right.

718
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,980
Jay Leno does his famous line that
brought the tonight show back and you know

719
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:00,600
when they have those shows and
they talk about, you know, the,

720
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,320
the history of the war between the
tonight show and the David Letterman show,

721
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,060
that was the show that turned the tide.

722
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,970
Or Jay Leno looked at Hugh grant and said,
what the hell were you thinking? Right.

723
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,880
Well, when he did that, you know,

724
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:14,630
and that was like this tiny little
conversation then only took place over a

725
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,790
couple of minutes.
When you love to sit Hugh grant down,

726
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:21,080
give him a glass of wine and give him
some weed and talked to him for hours and

727
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:24,030
go like, how many, how many hookers
did you can? You can tell me. Yeah.

728
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,260
I mean you and Elizabeth, whatever
the fuck her name was, he broken up.

729
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,080
She was super hot and she was super
like one of the hottest chicks ever.

730
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:33,950
And like even with that, do you have to
go out and get this strange new pussy?

731
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:38,990
He got dirty street. Needed
that nasty. Yeah. He's a rich,

732
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,800
famous man. If he wanted to, he
could. This is before the Internet,

733
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,490
you know what I mean?

734
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,690
He could've gone to get a like la
weekly and gotten a prostitute. Right.

735
00:42:47,691 --> 00:42:51,260
They always had that 30 he wanted,
he wanted it. He wanted to go street

736
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,710
girlfriend, but she's still beautiful.
But my early, early, yes. Hurley,

737
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:02,510
my reaction was, I don't think she's nasty
and bed. Oh, you just can probably lazy.

738
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,830
Listen. Probably Lazy. Maybe
lazy with Hugh Grant. Oh,

739
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,510
I bet with the right dude gets a hold
of her. She'll fuck the life outta here.

740
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,130
Okay. Yeah. Fair enough. Yeah. It's just,
you've got to impress a girl like that.

741
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:14,800
You got to fuck the shit out of her.
Right.

742
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,500
That girl's so pretty and she's famous.
You've got to do a lot of work.

743
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:19,940
So he's probably tired
of doing all that work.

744
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:23,310
You want to pull over and just get his
dick sucking bitch. Get in the car. So

745
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,830
here's your money. That's what he
wanted. He wanted some crazy moment,

746
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:34,460
like the exact opposite of
what it is at home or at home.

747
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:37,330
He probably has to work for it, man. She
probably turns him down all the time.

748
00:43:37,331 --> 00:43:39,950
It's probably argues with them.
She's probably challenges.

749
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,650
That's why I don't understand why
you got married, cause you're,

750
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,440
you're like a free dude. You're
like, I'm going to do comedy,

751
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,570
I'm going to do UFC shit.
I'm gonna have my own podcast.

752
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:51,020
It's like that part of your
life is so free. And then like,

753
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:55,040
I've done like everything I can
to like be married, you know,

754
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,200
to not be mad, to not be married and like,
that's why a little bit, well, it's, it's,

755
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,000
it's all about finding the right person.

756
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:04,400
If you find the right person and you
have starting to having children,

757
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,530
having a child. To me it's way more
of a commitment. The kid first. Okay.

758
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,590
Having a child's Wayne warm got pulling
out. I suck at pulling out. Yeah.

759
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,340
The whole bit about it. The
first one wasn't planned,
the second one was planning.

760
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,030
Oh, okay. But uh, yeah man, I just
preposterous. The idea is ridiculous.

761
00:44:23,031 --> 00:44:26,180
The idea that you're gonna write some
shit down and that someone is going to be

762
00:44:26,181 --> 00:44:28,550
legally entangled with you and then
you're going to have to sit in front of a

763
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:31,380
bunch of other people when
you want to break up her,

764
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:34,320
they have to decide how your money
gets distributed. Yeah. It was crazy.

765
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,430
And in your situation, it's a terrible
idea because you've got a lot of money.

766
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,840
That's before I had a lot of money
that I never was into the idea of it.

767
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:47,010
Of course it's stupid. It's a
stupid idea. My, my wife likes it,

768
00:44:47,011 --> 00:44:50,820
so I did it because we have to make her
up and it makes her happy and I'm not

769
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:54,780
going anywhere, man. I'm not going to
be that guy. I mean, history, hookers,

770
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,250
none of that shit.
I want to make a robot dirty streets.

771
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,640
So it's not a real close person

772
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,820
or they're getting closer to making that
you were at the Avn awards, right? Yeah,

773
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:09,090
they had a, they had
fucked up people. Again,

774
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,030
I think the adult video news
awards, they had a lot of, uh,

775
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,120
like kind of real doll technology there.

776
00:45:15,121 --> 00:45:17,150
And then they have one that
like talks to you and still,

777
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,620
it's still kind of just like,
you're fucking a dead person. Oh,

778
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,240
well they had a Japanese, they had a
Japanese robot that was fairly realistic.

779
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:25,500
It wasn't a sexual robot,

780
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:29,040
but it was a robot that will like
talk to you and for companionship.

781
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:33,420
The lips moved fairly. Realistically.
We're going to get to a blade runner day.

782
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,620
It's going to have,
we're getting there.

783
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:39,340
It's 100% I mean if you look
at the fact that the, the,

784
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,670
the super computers that they had in
the 1960s filled entire rooms and they

785
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,070
didn't have the power
that your iPhone has.

786
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,940
Just think about that and think about
these robots now and what we're going to

787
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,520
have a hundred years from now
or a thousand years from now,

788
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,550
but the blade runner
thing is 100% inevitable.

789
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,950
You're invited to the
wedding with the first robot.

790
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,990
You're going to marry a robot dude.
They'll kill you,

791
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,100
they'll kill you when they
find out that you, you,

792
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:05,470
you have an explanation data on them.
Can I just,

793
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:10,500
if you bought super hot robot hookers
and they have this implanted memory or if

794
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:14,220
their life with you, this perfect
life with you and how deeply, deeply,

795
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,400
deeply in love with you they are,

796
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:20,220
and then they realize that at line on
year five they die because that's when you

797
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:25,221
get tired of chicks and you want to bring
in another one and program a new life

798
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,840
into her brain.
This saifai portrait total real.

799
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,020
Here's the thing

800
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,100
thing is like when you go to like a sex
store or a porn convention like that and

801
00:46:36,101 --> 00:46:39,460
you see like the dildos that they have
like this advance a dildo technology,

802
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:41,410
they teledildonics or whatever.

803
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,720
It's like there's not a human dick
that could do what these dildos do.

804
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,640
They vibrate, they rotate and they
go like this. So I think last year,

805
00:46:48,641 --> 00:46:52,810
right last year was like the first year
I went and I'm walking out and there's

806
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,720
like a hard drive that looks like that
and the guy's like, come over here.

807
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:56,760
And I'm like, no, he's like,

808
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,720
come over. He's like, he's
like, he's like stickers

809
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,490
finger in that in the computer right
there. And I'm like, no, I don't want to.

810
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,490
And he's like, dude, there was
no one else around. He was like,

811
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,490
just stick your finger in that hard
drive. And I was like, all right.

812
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:14,520
And I stuck it in and it was wet and it
was warm and it was doing things a human

813
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:19,090
vagina can never do. It was
like, and I was like, I'm
about to come out of my face.

814
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,670
And I was like,
just the same way girls

815
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:28,050
who use a lot of builders, they're
pussies become desensitized. I was like,

816
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:30,250
if I buy this thing right now,
I'll never fucking

817
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,100
leave the house again.
I'll fuck this little computer box.

818
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,410
And if they put it into one of these
android things, I mean there won't be a,

819
00:47:37,411 --> 00:47:39,640
a woman who has a vagina
like tighter than that.

820
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,310
There was a science fiction comic
book that I read when I was a kid.

821
00:47:43,311 --> 00:47:47,030
I'll never forget it was a heavy metal
stuff or it was something along those

822
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:51,770
lines. It was, um, it was, uh, well,
whatever it was was a black and white one.

823
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,590
I don't remember. It was
a robot that started, um,

824
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,640
the guy had a robot as a, you
know, like a slave or whatever.

825
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,630
But the robot was like very humanlike
and like very muscular and big.

826
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:06,680
And the robot started fucking his wife
and then he went to stop the robot from

827
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:11,150
fucking, his wife from the robot broke his
arm. And like, it's really scary thing.

828
00:48:11,151 --> 00:48:14,540
It's rubber. It had this big giant
cock and like it was in the, you know,

829
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:16,090
the thing that he was
going to continue fighting.

830
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:19,040
The robot was like laughing as he was
fucking his wife while the guys like

831
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,770
thinking what did I do like
holding his broken arm,

832
00:48:21,771 --> 00:48:24,260
which soft fucked up all
this robot fucks his wife.

833
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,800
But that image like really
stuck into my head. Cause I,

834
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:30,710
it if we really do develop,

835
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:31,893
uh,

836
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,530
artificial human being that
thinks it's a human being, right.

837
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,930
And especially if we make
them ridiculously strong or
they're going to fuck your

838
00:48:40,931 --> 00:48:44,830
wife and they're going to break your arm.
If you tried to stop him here, get it.

839
00:48:44,831 --> 00:48:49,090
We're not going to, they're not read
that website. Brian, the robot robot.

840
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:51,820
Robot robot.

841
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,740
Oh yeah. We're so desensitized. We need
conch holding. We need mouth gagged.

842
00:48:56,741 --> 00:48:59,490
Can Double Anal double vag.

843
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,760
I mean, it's crazy. They already to do
that in Japan. These guys aren't ya? Oh,

844
00:49:04,761 --> 00:49:05,151
Taco.

845
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:10,151
Like there's crazy fan of a educators
subject like porn or whatever right there

846
00:49:10,311 --> 00:49:14,060
during the ceremonial marriage thing with
the robots and shit like that in Japan.

847
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:19,160
Oh really? In Japan? Yes, yes. My home
parish. It's weird. I get it. But yeah,

848
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:24,110
they're doing that. It's, it's really
interesting. I, like I said, I'm happy,

849
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,710
but I wouldn't recommend it. I wouldn't
recommend it on the right one. Yeah.

850
00:49:27,711 --> 00:49:31,810
But it's not, it's not a commander is
I don't like to talk to. Okay. Okay.

851
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:36,580
The um, um, the odds of finding somebody,

852
00:49:36,581 --> 00:49:39,430
the odds of finding somebody that you get
along with as good as I get along with

853
00:49:39,431 --> 00:49:40,390
her,
they're pretty slim.

854
00:49:40,391 --> 00:49:43,120
I haven't found that many people in my
whole life that I get along with like

855
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,890
that. Right. You just, you get,

856
00:49:45,230 --> 00:49:49,030
it's a compatibility thing cause I'm
not the right dude for a lot of chicks.

857
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,280
Right. You know, and you're not
the right dude for a lot of chicks.

858
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,130
It's like you got to
find the one who's like,

859
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,240
that's what I've been looking for and,
and Eh, well, I'm happy to hear that, man.

860
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,700
That's cool, man. It's good
to be happy. And it's the,

861
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:07,300
um, the idea of being able
to raise kids. It was always,

862
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:09,580
I guess a real scary thing
for me when I was younger.

863
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:12,580
Like it wasn't on when I was
in my twenties. I thought
of it as like a burden.

864
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:15,610
That's all I thought of it as like, oh
my God, imagine if I had a kid right now,

865
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:16,730
I'd be fucked.
Right.

866
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:20,360
I don't even like feeding my cat if
I had a kid like Jesus Christ. Right.

867
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,970
But once you go through the
experience and you'd become an adult,

868
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,390
you kind of have a different perspective
on the idea of a finite lifetime. Right.

869
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,930
And the idea of the,

870
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:35,750
the concept of being able to raise a
human from the very beginning and like

871
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:40,310
educate them and expose them to different
things along the way to communicate

872
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:43,910
with them. How old were you when you had
your first kid? The first biological kid?

873
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,750
I was 40. Uh, see it's totally different.

874
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:50,840
So guys like you and boarding and give
me hope because I think Bordain had his

875
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:53,030
first kid or I think it was 50.

876
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:56,630
I think when he had his
first game or it's, um,

877
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,340
it's easier to understand what's
going on right? When the, when,

878
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,010
if I was 21 if I got my girlfriend
pregnant and I would, I buried her back,

879
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:09,011
then I might get so overwhelmed by the
responsibility of it all and not being a

880
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,550
Co.

881
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,370
The other thing is that I'm
in a comfortable place in
my life where I don't have

882
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:17,900
to worry about shit or worry about my
job or I've been working for the UFC for

883
00:51:17,901 --> 00:51:22,901
like 12 years now and then even more
before like 11 year it's been 11 years,

884
00:51:23,931 --> 00:51:28,931
but even more back in the day it's like
another two years from another owner may

885
00:51:30,111 --> 00:51:32,680
have been doing this for so long.
It's not something I worry about losing.

886
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:37,620
So out of all this, like out of all
the things that you do and you do,

887
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,550
you used to do the fear factor, you
do the UFC, you do your podcast,

888
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,430
you can do standup comedy like out of
all these things like which is your

889
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:47,070
passion that you,
is it all like I love everything or

890
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,580
I really do love everything, but it's
like all except fear factor. I just,

891
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,000
I loved the money from fear factor.
Right? That was it. Every now and then.

892
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:56,100
I loved it. You know, every
now and then. It was fun.

893
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,670
It was fun when they were cool people,
you know, look, it could be cool,

894
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:01,000
but I wouldn't do it
for free. Right, right.

895
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,490
And I would do all the other shit
for free because you love it. Yeah.

896
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:06,270
It's all the other shit. I don't
think, oh, I'm just doing this for my,

897
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:10,260
for the money. Right. It's a and
and doing something that you like.

898
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:14,940
The difference between say the UFC seen
fear factor was sometimes I would enjoy

899
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,300
fear factor. When I worked for
the UFC, I always enjoy it.

900
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:23,420
I mean I like some people might think is
a boring fight I enjoy because anything

901
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:25,051
can happen.

902
00:52:25,051 --> 00:52:28,140
It might be boring for a couple seconds
and it dude gets cracked and it becomes

903
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:32,640
the most exciting shit at me. Right,
right. You know, I'm ready. I enjoy it.

904
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,430
So the differences dif you,

905
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,550
if you're doing something you're
only doing for the money, right?

906
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:41,810
You're always going to have this,
this feeling like, all right,

907
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,740
just plow through this
and do it for the money.

908
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,430
But when you're doing something that you
love, you'll eliminate that bad feeling.

909
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:50,370
Well, that's the thing is when
I watched those, I'm like, well,

910
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:52,270
like when I hear you doing the
announcing for UFC, I'm like,

911
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,510
this guy sounds like he's super, super
pumped right now. Like, you know,

912
00:52:55,511 --> 00:52:58,390
it sounds like you're into it.
So, and like you're like, oh,

913
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:01,450
when you were like referring
back to fights from like
10 years earlier, I'm like,

914
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,390
is there something in front of you
showing those things you remember?

915
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,150
No, that's not only that. I don't even
do any research. You just love the sport.

916
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:12,240
Yeah. My, uh, my research can do
some trivia with you. Sure. Yeah.

917
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:12,761
All right.

918
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:17,761
So the first time Bj Penn fought George
St Pierre was like in Vegas 10 years ago

919
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:20,300
or eight?

920
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,500
No, no, it was that long
ago. It was probably 2006 I
would, I would gas, I'm not,

921
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:26,500
I mean, I, I can't tell
you the exact numbers,

922
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:29,640
but I can tell you what happened in the
fight. So who won that fight? Uh, well,

923
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:34,410
George won the fight, but who
really? I thought Bj did more damage.

924
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,730
And all George did was take him down
a couple of times in the later rounds.

925
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,400
But BJ thumb, George and the
eye is a very interesting fight.

926
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:46,200
He thumb thumb George in the eye in the
first round and the right eye and he had

927
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:47,880
a cut and that really fucked with them.

928
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:51,590
And that was the first time George had
faced like real serious adversity inside

929
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:54,240
the cage.
It's because it wasn't a thumb on purpose.

930
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:56,140
It's like people have to realize that,
um,

931
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,460
because the fact that thumbs aren't
exposed even with a legitimate punch,

932
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:02,880
a total, which pj's was
completely legitimate punch,

933
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:07,910
oftentimes a thumb can go right, right.
Or any of the eyeball. Right. And uh,

934
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,560
you could really fuck up a Guy's
vision from that. And you know,

935
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:13,320
it was just because Bj had cleaner
striking back then. I mean,

936
00:54:13,321 --> 00:54:16,590
he fucking won the fight.
I think you want to fight too because uh,

937
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:17,700
I believe he won.

938
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,780
He did more damage and I think ultimately
the Japanese had a better way of

939
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:26,610
judging fights then. Then the standard
10 point must system that we use,

940
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:29,070
which is really like a boxing system.
This is unbelievable.

941
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:32,420
This is fucking crime at Joe's. The real
deal. I mean, you watch how many fights,

942
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:36,360
the fact that you remember that from the,
well, I've called at least a thousand.

943
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:38,090
Jesus Christ.
At least

944
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,990
you wanna hear a funny story about
that fight. Yeah, sure. So I just,

945
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,490
I was in the Congo.

946
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,950
How many stories begin with that?

947
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:54,390
I was there, I was there for vice and
I, and I just came back to La and, um,

948
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:59,830
I have a bit of a gambling
problem and the way my gambling,

949
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:04,390
uh, career, I guess is
set up is, um, basically,

950
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,630
yeah, 2006 or around that time, like six,

951
00:55:07,631 --> 00:55:10,330
seven years ago when I was going there,

952
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:14,410
I was going there every week and
winning about a thousand dollars.

953
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,520
And then I would stop. That's, I could,
I could for sure go to Vegas and when,

954
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:21,490
you know, between 800 and a thousand
dollars, you know, and that,

955
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,500
that was what I was doing for money.

956
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:25,240
And then I would be painting
on the side or whatever.

957
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,940
And I would do that every week.

958
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:31,330
So I came back from Africa and
I was going to go on, you know,

959
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:33,850
I was going to fly to go or
drive to go see my parents.

960
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:36,280
I hadn't seen them in a few months.
And um,

961
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:41,770
Bj was being sponsored by their clothing
company. Ruca do you know RVC sure. Yeah,

962
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:46,540
I know those guys. So pat the owner is
one of my best friends and he goes, Dave,

963
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:51,370
you've got to take a BJ's. The fight was
the next day with George Saint Pierre.

964
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:55,540
And he said, uh, something with the
logo was not big enough or something.

965
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:59,380
So he still had the pants. He's like,
these pants need to get to, to, to, uh,

966
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:03,610
to Bj in Vegas. And I said, all right,
so sense of why, why do I got to go?

967
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,870
He's like, cause you fucking Love
Vegas. And I'm like, dude, I,

968
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,750
I'm still wearing the same clothes that
I was wearing in Congo for like two

969
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:14,440
months. Like I need to go shower, I
need to go see my parents. He's like,

970
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,380
he's like Dave.
And then he passes me $40,000,

971
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,650
which was the most amount of cash I'd
ever seen in my life. And he goes,

972
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,570
you need to go put this on Bj to
win. And I, Whoa, dude. He's like,

973
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,030
you love to gamble. I trust you. He
goes, go give Bj his pants and you know,

974
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,760
go give Bj's pants and go put this
money on Bj Darwin. And I was like,

975
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:38,880
are you sure dude? And
he's like, I was like,

976
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,710
so he gives me, um, he
gives me a clean shirt.

977
00:56:42,711 --> 00:56:46,670
It was just like a Bj Penn security
shirt. You know what I said, Bj Penn and,

978
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:47,600
and security on the back.

979
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:52,810
So I take the red eye into Vegas and
sitting next to me in a safe way.

980
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:57,740
Plastic bag is Bj Penn's pants
and in my pocket is $40,000.

981
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,080
And he goes, when you get to Vegas,
go to go up to the penthouse Bj,

982
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,340
it was at Mandalay Bay, I think.
He goes, go, go to Mandalay bay.

983
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:11,540
And at this point I knew Bj. I wasn't
as pretty good friends with them now,

984
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,340
but I didn't know him that well back then.

985
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:19,240
So I get there and I go upstairs to
his room and he travels with his whole

986
00:57:19,371 --> 00:57:21,500
family. Then they, you know,

987
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:26,300
they're usually like loud and fun and
I get up to the room and uh, I have,

988
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,630
I have his pants ago. Pat told me to bring
you your parents and he's like, okay,

989
00:57:29,631 --> 00:57:32,930
thanks. And his brother,
Reagan's like, it's just,

990
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,330
it was like a weird vibe in the room.
And I was like,

991
00:57:35,331 --> 00:57:37,400
what the fuck is going on dude?
He's like, come over here.

992
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,820
He's like the guy in the next room
over brought home a 20 year old,

993
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:43,400
21 year old hooker.

994
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,380
Fucked her and strangled her and then
just dropped her in the hallway and until

995
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,310
her and killed her,
she's dead.

996
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:56,270
And because she was dead in the
hallway right in front of Bj's room,

997
00:57:57,180 --> 00:57:59,820
they took beach even though
they knew he didn't do it.

998
00:57:59,821 --> 00:58:03,130
Like they took him in for questioning.
Yeah.

999
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:06,410
So I'm like freaking out and
he's like, dude, Bj's at the,

1000
00:58:06,411 --> 00:58:10,650
been at the police station all
day answering questions and he's,

1001
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,640
he has his fight tomorrow night. So
I'm like, whoa. So I run downstairs.

1002
00:58:14,641 --> 00:58:18,990
I called Pat Pat. This was the day
of the wins or the day of the fight?

1003
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,400
The day before. The day
before, day before the wedding.

1004
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,650
So he wasn't cutting any wait for
that day right before the fight.

1005
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:29,570
The day right before the fight.
So Day of the wedding. Yeah. So I,

1006
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:33,140
I don't know exactly cause I
just got there at midnight.
So I go downstairs, I go,

1007
00:58:33,141 --> 00:58:35,980
Pat, are you sure you want
me to put this money on him?

1008
00:58:35,981 --> 00:58:38,080
Because he just came back from
the police station. He might not,

1009
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,260
he might have a little fuck
dude. BJ's a champ. He doesn't,

1010
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,000
he's going to fucking smoke this guy.

1011
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,960
And for a guy who's been
the Vegas like every week,

1012
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,580
I go there every week for like the last
20 years, I had never been to Vegas.

1013
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:56,210
It felt like this before. More Hawaiians
that had never left Hawaiian. We're it,

1014
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,660
you know, this was like, they weren't
even like the main fight, right?

1015
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:02,050
But like George Saint Pierre
is the hero of Canada,

1016
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:04,990
so there was all these fucking
Canadians in, in Vegas.

1017
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,820
And then there was all these Hawaiians
in Vegas and it was just like a fuck fuck

1018
00:59:09,821 --> 00:59:11,950
Canada and like fucking Hawaii.

1019
00:59:11,951 --> 00:59:15,310
Like it was like I was playing cards and
people would see my Bj pincher and they

1020
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:18,490
go, fuck Bj Penn, Fuck Hawaii. And then
there are all these people will be like,

1021
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:23,080
it was like electric. Like it was like
crazy. And I was like, wow, pat, you want,

1022
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:26,270
are you sure rude? And then this
is where I found out that, uh,

1023
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,820
a sports book is not
actually part of the casino.

1024
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:31,580
It's a separate entity
that's like rinse out.

1025
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,260
So I went and I said 40 grand on Bj Penn
when, after I talked to Pat, I was like,

1026
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:38,120
Hey, are you sure you want me
to put this money? He's like,

1027
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:40,220
Bj is going to kill this guy.
It doesn't matter. He's, he's,

1028
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,470
he's got the heart of a champion.
And I was like, all right.

1029
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:46,340
And I go in there and the odds,
if you don't remember,

1030
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:50,900
everyone already thought Bj was going to
win. So if I put 40 grand on Bj to win,

1031
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,250
I would only got back like 30 grand
I think. And if I put 40 on St Pier,

1032
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:57,050
I would've got back like 70,000 I think.

1033
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:02,590
So the odds are way in Bj Penn's favor
so they wouldn't even take a bet that

1034
01:00:02,961 --> 01:00:05,870
big. So I was like, Oh shit.
So he's like, and they were,

1035
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:07,460
all the sports works were
closing so they were like,

1036
01:00:07,461 --> 01:00:09,860
you have to do it the next day. So
I was like, all right, I'm going to,

1037
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,600
I'll just go to a strip club I guess.

1038
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:16,370
So I go to a strip club and as soon
as I walk in or get out of the car,

1039
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,130
a security guard sees me and
he goes right this way sir.

1040
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,910
And then he takes me to like this
giant private room and I'm like,

1041
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,550
still smell like shit from Africa.
And I'm like,

1042
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,090
they just bring over the hottest
strippers. And then I'm like,

1043
01:00:29,091 --> 01:00:32,240
what the fuck's going on? And I realized
I'm wearing a Bj Penn security shirt.

1044
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:36,260
So they think Bj's coming. They're like,
they're like, when's Bj gonna come here?

1045
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,770
And all the security guards
are like sucking my dick,
just like Bj's is the best.

1046
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:42,800
He's going to win the fight tomorrow. And
I was like, I was like, oh. So I'm like,

1047
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:46,080
I'm going to take advantage
of the situation. I'm like,

1048
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:49,790
I'm like sitting there with my friend
Harry. We were like getting lap dances,

1049
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,410
all this shit. And then I was like, fuck,

1050
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,780
they're going to at some point
expect media to come here.

1051
01:00:53,781 --> 01:00:57,290
So I sneak out the side and then,
uh,

1052
01:00:57,770 --> 01:01:01,600
I don't think I slept that night. And then
the first, you know, I was, I was, I was,

1053
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,130
it was one of those nights where I stay
at the Strip club till like the sun

1054
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:09,131
comes up and then the next day I start
putting the money down on Bj to win.

1055
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,170
But it was like seven grand at like the,
you know,

1056
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:15,260
the Venetian and then like eight grand
over here and had to split it up a little

1057
01:01:15,261 --> 01:01:19,560
bit. So I, I,

1058
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:23,480
I was like running around and I couldn't
get the money spread out so I was only

1059
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,470
able to bet like 32 grand and I
still had eight grand in cash on me.

1060
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,930
And then the fight starts and like you
said, like it was just like you said,

1061
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:37,490
like everyone, the place is going
nuts. Like it's going fucking insane.

1062
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:41,450
Like everyone's like fuck, like getting
off, Fuck Hawaii. And it's like,

1063
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:46,820
and then the fight happens. I'm like, Oh
fuck St Pier, it looks bloody first round.

1064
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:51,290
I'm like, this fights done like Bj, Bj
one and then saint peers, a smart fighter.

1065
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:55,940
So he liked deflected a lot or whatever.
And then when decision time came around,

1066
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:01,550
they gave it to St pier by one point
decision and the place goes whoa.

1067
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:05,180
And they started like screaming like
I couldn't believe it. Like I'm like,

1068
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:09,030
oh my God, cause I had my own money
on the fight too. He walks offstage,

1069
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,080
his brothers like get them
drunk right away. And then,

1070
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,650
I don't know if you go out at
all after the fights or whatever,

1071
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,740
but I've never seen Vegas this
violent before in my life.

1072
01:02:18,741 --> 01:02:21,750
Like there was like street
brawls inside casinos.

1073
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:25,560
There was Canadians beating up Hawaiians,
Hawaiians beating up. Like, it was crazy.

1074
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:30,510
I knew Hawaiian guy that put his house
up for the whole thing. And yeah,

1075
01:02:30,511 --> 01:02:33,270
I mean, it was insane. People
were going crazy. I've never,

1076
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:34,830
in all the years I've been in Vegas,

1077
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:39,350
I've never seen a situation like this
where people had his house on Bj. Yeah.

1078
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,410
I mean it was fucking crazy. So what
do you win when you bet your house?

1079
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:44,910
I don't know.
I think in another house,

1080
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:48,360
I think you've just put the value of
it up. I don't know. I don't know.

1081
01:02:48,361 --> 01:02:53,150
The details are there. So he lost his
house. Yeah. So he lost his house and,

1082
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,290
and yeah. You saw the fight. I mean,

1083
01:02:55,291 --> 01:02:59,000
I was looking at that guy's an idiot move.
I mean,

1084
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:03,330
especially when you know that the
judging and MMA judging and then my man,

1085
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:07,770
so sketchy. Yeah. I mean it was,
it was fucking crazy. So then, um,

1086
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:10,320
just as a side thing,

1087
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:14,460
the girl that I was with were seven
years then we had just broken up,

1088
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,600
happened to be in Vegas.

1089
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,390
So I was having dinner with her after
and I was telling her what's happening.

1090
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:22,680
I was like, dude, I just lost $32,000
off my friends money on this thing.

1091
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:26,430
And she was like, oh. And I was
calling him and I was saying, Hey pat,

1092
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,700
I still have eight grand of your money.
Do you want me to gamble with it?

1093
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:31,500
And when you're 32 grand
back and he's like,

1094
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,740
get your fucking ass back over here.

1095
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:39,770
Like he was so pissed off and so I was
just having dinner with her and then he

1096
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:43,080
calls me back and he goes,
you know what I was,

1097
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,200
I was planning on winning the money or
losing it. So go for it. And I was like,

1098
01:03:46,201 --> 01:03:50,220
you want, I can do this. And remember
I've only won a thousand dollars.

1099
01:03:50,221 --> 01:03:51,690
That was like the most
money I've ever won.

1100
01:03:51,691 --> 01:03:55,830
I never even had like 8,000 or
40,000. So I was like, shit,

1101
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,790
I'm going to walk into that high limit
room for the first time in my life. So,

1102
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,450
but I'm talking with her and you know,
like right after a long break,

1103
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,520
you've been together with someone
for a long time and you break up.

1104
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:09,870
There's like that maybe we're still going
to get together. So like I'm like, fuck,

1105
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:13,940
I'm going to go gamble right now.
And then in this situation, uh,

1106
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,020
the fuck was that guy, the rush
hour guy, Chris, Chris Tucker.

1107
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:23,250
So Chris Tucker and like, you know, a
posse of like 40 people like walk in.

1108
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:27,990
Then they start hitting on her right
away, right when I got up. So I was like,

1109
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:31,020
fuck, I got to go win this money. But like
Chris Tucker, it looks like he's gonna.

1110
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,180
I was like sorta stuck. I was like, fuck,

1111
01:04:33,181 --> 01:04:35,640
this mother fucker is hitting on my ex
girlfriend. And I was like, all right,

1112
01:04:35,641 --> 01:04:36,510
I'm just going to run and do it.

1113
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:40,650
So I walked into the Venetian high limit
room for the first time and then eight

1114
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:43,540
grand in like thousand dollars
chips. It's like, you know,

1115
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,120
it's like a little stack.

1116
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:49,680
And I split it up and I started
playing like my system, the way I play,

1117
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:54,090
and I won about 36 grand
within like 15 minutes. Whoa.

1118
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,770
And that fucked me up.

1119
01:04:55,771 --> 01:04:58,770
It's like smoking weed your whole
life and then doing cocaine, you know?

1120
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:02,310
So then I called him, I was
like, Hey pat, I, I'm up to 36.

1121
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:03,570
You want me to win the last?
He said,

1122
01:05:03,571 --> 01:05:06,870
get your fucking ass back to Costa
Mesa right now. I was like, all right.

1123
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:09,120
All right. All right. I was like, I
really think I could win the whole 40.

1124
01:05:09,121 --> 01:05:14,100
He's like, stop, stop right now. So I
stopped. And then, uh, yeah, I mean,

1125
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:19,370
I sort of blame basically Bj for my
gambling problem because after that,

1126
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:24,220
after that moment, I could never go to
Vegas again and just win a thousand.

1127
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:29,020
I had to like win at least
20 grand because of the
rush. You can't go backwards,

1128
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:32,140
you know? Like, I'm like, I just
want 36 grand with this guy's money.

1129
01:05:32,141 --> 01:05:34,710
Why can't I win it with
my own money? Right. So,

1130
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:37,570
and I didn't have that kind of money
to gamble with, so I, you know,

1131
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:41,530
I like took a loan out to do it.
Like it was, he took a loan out.

1132
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:46,230
I was like started, I was very confident
that I could do it, you know, so. Wow.

1133
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:50,890
Yeah. And how did that work out? I made a
small fortune doing that. I can't, yeah,

1134
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,160
I can't, I can't play it. Most of
the casinos in Vegas, I don't know.

1135
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:58,900
What do you play?
I play every table game play poker.

1136
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:00,040
I don't really play so much.

1137
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,330
I played for fun and like now like
sometimes they invite me to like celebrity

1138
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:09,310
poker things. I beat actually all the UFC
guys. That'd be truck Ladell I beat uh,

1139
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:14,930
uh, um, fuck. I can't think of the
guy's name right now. What is it about,

1140
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:17,350
why are you so good at this?
Why are you still get a card games?

1141
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,380
I think to answer your question,

1142
01:06:20,381 --> 01:06:24,880
I think it's because I'm really good at
also pulling out, you know, like, no,

1143
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,010
I'm not even joking.
I'm really awesome at it.

1144
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:29,500
Like people were like the
amount of funding you do,

1145
01:06:29,501 --> 01:06:32,180
the fact that you haven't got a girl
pregnant right now. Right. I'm like,

1146
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,740
because I'm extremely
disciplined, you know? And um,

1147
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:39,700
I knew that I would like gambling sex,

1148
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:44,590
like drink and anything that is enjoyable
is, becomes an addiction, right?

1149
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,560
Because
if you're an addict,

1150
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:52,561
you want to keep doing it and you can't
stop and then you're like in like an AA

1151
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:53,740
thing going,
I don't know.

1152
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:56,620
I just went into the bar to have one
drink and the next thing you know,

1153
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:00,430
and that's everyone in poker,
that's everyone's biggest
story. Right. Right there.

1154
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:05,431
Like I was up and then like that's why
Vegas is there because no one ever saw

1155
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,300
the type of person that I actually
can stop. I know that I can't stop.

1156
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:14,550
So I hire someone to come with me to
physically make me stop real. Yeah.

1157
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,780
And I've been doing that since I was 15.

1158
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,790
You've hired someone to come
gamble with you since I have no,

1159
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,770
not from 15 to 23.

1160
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,370
I consistently lost every
paycheck that you know,

1161
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,510
and I would be going back from
Vegas with that. I don't understand.

1162
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:35,260
Like I worked at Toysrus for two months
and made a couple hundred dollars and I

1163
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:39,610
was like, I went to Vegas and I doubled
it, but now I'm leaving with nothing.

1164
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:43,750
Like it was that like I had it right,
but why didn't I leave with it?

1165
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:47,320
Nobody leaves with it and it
was just baffling. I was like,

1166
01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:53,020
you can come to Vegas and when people win
money here but nobody ever leaves with

1167
01:07:53,021 --> 01:07:55,540
it. What is that? What the fuck is that?

1168
01:07:56,050 --> 01:08:00,370
And it's like the same thing
as an alcoholic who like
I had a nice buzz going,

1169
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:04,060
why did I have to take it to the point
where like blacked out and was puking?

1170
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:06,190
It's like, cause you
can't stop. So I was like,

1171
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:11,220
if I can pinpoint if I can know about
myself and be honest with myself that I

1172
01:08:12,311 --> 01:08:16,670
definitely cannot stop. Why don't I just
hire someone to stop me? I tell them,

1173
01:08:16,671 --> 01:08:19,520
look, when I get to this number
stopped me and if I keep going,

1174
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,440
grab me by my throat,
picked me up.

1175
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:26,150
And so I developed this whole
system of like, you know,

1176
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,870
pulling out and it's uh,

1177
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:31,700
it worked for a long time and it actually,

1178
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,480
it helped like in every aspect of my life.
Like,

1179
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:39,200
so do you have this guy with
you everywhere you go? Well,

1180
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:44,030
I did for a long time. You know, he's
like, hold on, let me check your balls.

1181
01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:48,380
You're not ready to come yet. Now.
He was awesome. He's a Harry Kim.

1182
01:08:48,381 --> 01:08:51,470
He was like my partner. We hitchhiked
around the whole world together.

1183
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:55,370
We did a show on vice where we
hitchhiked from like La to Miami,

1184
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,790
Tijuana to Alaska, Beijing,
the Hong Kong. Holy Shit.

1185
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,010
So I filmed a show doing it.

1186
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:04,820
We filmed the show doing it and it's
called thumbs up and yeah. I mean,

1187
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,520
what year did you do this?
This was years ago.

1188
01:09:07,550 --> 01:09:11,580
We probably did the first one
seven years ago. Wow. Yeah.

1189
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,490
So yeah, to answer your question, yeah, I
did bring him everywhere with me and, uh,

1190
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:20,660
doing that allowed the both of us to
like actually never grow up, you know,

1191
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:24,320
cause we're like, hey, let's keep fucking,
let's keep the party going. And was like,

1192
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:28,940
okay, let's just go to Vegas and when 20
grand and we would do it. And you know,

1193
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:31,400
that's, that's around the
time we met you. Right.

1194
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:35,900
And Jill Harris Great. He's
like catty, wouldn't you say
like, Hey, let me help you.

1195
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:39,580
Right. And I'll be watching him gamble
and I don't have a stomach for it.

1196
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:43,650
Like there's Times David Lucy and
thousand 5,000, 10,000. Like I,

1197
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,510
I just had to walk away by
Harry sell discipline and um,

1198
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,360
he gives them good advice
and they worked as a team.

1199
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:52,610
So I leave a couple of hours later,
they'll come back,

1200
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,880
they're just pull hundreds of,
you know, just bills on the bed.

1201
01:09:56,410 --> 01:10:00,520
How does that work? They'd tell you can't
come and play in the casino anymore.

1202
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:02,680
It's not like a,
your band.

1203
01:10:02,681 --> 01:10:06,500
But there they definitely let you know
you're not welcome anymore. Like they,

1204
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,280
they make all kinds of things
uncomfortable for you to cow,

1205
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:13,690
like a casino that is welcoming to me.
Like,

1206
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:17,980
and I'm not like some weird like
math genius or anything. My,

1207
01:10:18,110 --> 01:10:23,020
my method like I could explain to you
right now how to pull out. Right. Okay.

1208
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:26,260
Like you fuck a girl and when it feels
good you just pull out like way before

1209
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:30,250
you're going to come, you know. So I
could sit here and like the shit with me,

1210
01:10:30,251 --> 01:10:33,040
gambling is a super simple and I actually
haven't gambled in the long time cause

1211
01:10:33,041 --> 01:10:36,170
I don't need to anymore.
But basically, um,

1212
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,420
it's, I could explain it to
you, but to actually do it,

1213
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:43,780
it's like almost impossible. And I know
that too. That's why I have Harry with me.

1214
01:10:44,190 --> 01:10:47,770
And it's like if you go to Vegas
right now because of card counting,

1215
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:51,850
because of all these like
math nerds and shit blackjack,

1216
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:56,290
the most Max maximum bet you could
ever bet on black jacket is 25,000.

1217
01:10:56,830 --> 01:10:59,050
So that's that. That's the end. Yeah.

1218
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:04,170
That's the restrict you from going
crazy from playing progressive,

1219
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:09,130
you know, like basically progressive
is if you bet and you lose,

1220
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:12,780
you just double it each time so you
can just keep doubling forever. Right.

1221
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:15,570
If have the bank roll and
you'll never lose, right, right.

1222
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,690
I bet $10 I lose it then. And then
once you get it back, you're out. Ben,

1223
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:23,250
you start over at $10 a year. Right. You
know, and they, they get, they have a,

1224
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:27,630
they have a cap at 25 you're always ahead.
But I got to a point,

1225
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,870
I mean Vegas, the Vegas stories
I got, I could, you know,

1226
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:32,100
there are just like unreal.

1227
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,620
Like I got to a point where
they got rid of that for me.

1228
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:38,070
They would let me bet whatever I want.
I was betting like a quarter million,

1229
01:11:38,071 --> 01:11:39,630
a hand on blackjack.
So

1230
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,310
Jesus fucking Christ.

1231
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,780
What does that feel like in your hands
and your feet and your, your spinal cord.

1232
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:50,130
The shemale of gambling.

1233
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:52,790
It's like,
it's like you've done everything,

1234
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:57,920
you've done everything and nothing
works anymore. Like, you know, you get,

1235
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,240
you're like,
you've done everything,

1236
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,720
you've done anal and you've gotten the
blow job, you know, asked to mouth.

1237
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,470
You don't ask them about
if you've got the aids,

1238
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:07,830
you've got everything you need to
play it a shit and now you're like,

1239
01:12:07,831 --> 01:12:12,690
I have like I'm going to have to eat shit.
And it's been, and it was progressive.

1240
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:14,100
It was like,
you know,

1241
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,360
every time I went to Vegas I would win
$1,000 then every time I went to Vegas I

1242
01:12:18,361 --> 01:12:20,610
won 20 grand and then saw your brain goes,

1243
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:25,560
well why couldn't you do it with
the same style but with more money?

1244
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:28,830
And as long as the casinos kept
letting me raise the Max bet,

1245
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:30,840
I could keep pushing it harder and harder.

1246
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:34,520
And then who you are right now
are creating gambling addicts.

1247
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:38,160
They're listening to this. Like
this guy is smart. I'm smart too.

1248
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:41,870
I'm going to go out and make a
living gambling. Fuck, walk in here.

1249
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,930
You have to risk everything. You have
to risk everything. Like you're ready.

1250
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:50,960
Like you might have to risk
like everything you worked
for like your whole life.

1251
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,520
So that you can, when you're,
you don't, you can't pussy out.

1252
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,070
Like if you're going to go for it,
then you have to pull the trigger.

1253
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:00,570
So how do you change the odds? The odds
are that the casino wins 51% of the time.

1254
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:04,440
Right? More plus. Plus is it? Plus?
What is it? You're not going to,

1255
01:13:04,441 --> 01:13:06,600
you're not going to take down Vegas.
You don't.

1256
01:13:06,910 --> 01:13:11,340
You're going to just stick the tip in
and get a little bit and then it's like

1257
01:13:11,341 --> 01:13:15,140
bail and then do, it's like, it's
like Vegas is Goliath and your list,

1258
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:17,730
tiny little speck and you're just
taking little nicks out of it.

1259
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,360
You're not trying to take the house down.
How do you keep doing it though?

1260
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:23,970
How do you keep putting
it on the positive side?

1261
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:28,890
I still don't understand how you overcome
the 51% is the 51% of mathematical

1262
01:13:28,891 --> 01:13:33,120
thing because they're dealing with
what is the 51 whatever the number is.

1263
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:37,170
If people are in correcting, it's the how,
three, something like that. It's always,

1264
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,390
but it's pretty much 50 50 right.

1265
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:44,730
Baccarat is I think the best odds of
any game because which ones that which

1266
01:13:44,731 --> 01:13:45,980
ones?
I know buck rod is like,

1267
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:49,210
you're trying to get to natural
nine a natural night. It's,

1268
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:52,680
it's Baccarat is like one
of the stupidest games ever.

1269
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:56,410
It's what James Wall in place.
It's the mother fucker. It's, it's,

1270
01:13:56,411 --> 01:13:58,170
it's the game where when you walk past,

1271
01:13:58,171 --> 01:14:01,530
it's always Chinese people writing numbers
down and screaming and tearing up the

1272
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:05,700
cards. Like, but basically it
looks the most complicated,

1273
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:08,160
but it's like the same thing
as them flipping a coin.

1274
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,560
Like there's nothing you can do,
you can't hit, you can't stay.

1275
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:13,330
Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen.

1276
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:15,250
You could bet house or you can bet banker.

1277
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,240
So it's the closest to like a 50 50
kind of bet you can. You can bet.

1278
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:23,260
And so basically, like I
said, you bet progressive.

1279
01:14:23,261 --> 01:14:26,140
Every time you lose you just double it.
And the second you win it,

1280
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:27,550
you just go upstairs,
lock it up.

1281
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:31,060
And you just do that a couple times and
then you leave and you don't want every

1282
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:35,770
time Jesus Christ, you don't sit there
and you go, oh, I'm trying to like,

1283
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:40,660
and you leave when the
feeling is the best, like,

1284
01:14:42,330 --> 01:14:47,170
like breaking it down a sex again
is the best feeling after you come.

1285
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,970
Cause after you come you
just want to go to sleep.

1286
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:53,380
The best feeling is like when
you're about to come, you're like,

1287
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:56,970
you feel it coming. You know? I guess
coming actually is, I don't know.

1288
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:57,600
Cummings over

1289
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,770
depends on if someone's rubbing
your balls are not, is overrated.

1290
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,900
I think so. Well it's because you're
pulling out all the time. Yeah.

1291
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:09,310
That's my shit. Loads and chicks. It's
a hundred times better. It is like,

1292
01:15:09,311 --> 01:15:11,290
that's why everybody,
we remember when you were young,

1293
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,990
you were psyched when your girlfriend
was on the pill. You're like, oh yeah,

1294
01:15:13,991 --> 01:15:18,790
no condos bomb blast inside of our,
it's the greatest feeling of all times.

1295
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:20,350
I'm so much better than pulling out.

1296
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:23,030
Yeah, that's, that's true. It's true.

1297
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:26,660
I'm so psyched that you fucking have
this like unbelievable recall with these

1298
01:15:26,661 --> 01:15:27,494
fights.

1299
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,660
Dj One. That fucking fight man. Yeah,
that I, well it was very close though.

1300
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:36,740
You know the real problem is in judging,
there's a, there's an issue in judging.

1301
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:40,430
There's an also an issue in the way
they're scoring fights at 10 10 point must

1302
01:15:40,431 --> 01:15:45,150
system. It's like what's a ten eight
round? What's a ten seven round? I mean,

1303
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:49,700
does it, is it about damage is about
knockdowns is about ground control.

1304
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,410
I mean I just mentioned it
to Canada. That's why I was
like, hi, Canada's awesome.

1305
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:58,670
Hey, how could you say that? We're both
band from Canada. It's fucking amazing.

1306
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:03,350
It's so fun. Me and Yoshi both can't go to
Canada or Japan. Well, you're both. Fuck.

1307
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:06,830
I'll tell you what. Canada is this
shit. I'm going to Montreal and mark.

1308
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:10,280
What are you talking to? Boot. I
love it. They talked a little odd,

1309
01:16:10,281 --> 01:16:13,430
but they're the nicest people on earth,
that's for sure. I love it up there, man.

1310
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,760
I can't, I'm getting booked. I think
I'm doing Vancouver in March, booboo,

1311
01:16:16,761 --> 01:16:21,580
so hang on, hang [inaudible].
Last night at a show. Yeah.

1312
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:25,700
Canadians. The shit man. If I left Camp
America, I would move to Canada for sure.

1313
01:16:25,701 --> 01:16:28,640
I would really move to Vancouver if
I was not going to live in America.

1314
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:31,920
I need to live in Hawaii or Vancouver.
I go to Hawaii. Yeah, because Hawaii,

1315
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:36,440
Hawaii's not really America.
American might own that shit little shit.

1316
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:40,280
That's a why and I mean it's just
under the umbrella of protection.

1317
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,470
That is not America.
That's Hawaii.

1318
01:16:42,471 --> 01:16:46,400
That's why a lot of white people go over
there and have real problems cause they

1319
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:48,940
started tried to treat it like it's
the rest of America. Right, right.

1320
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:51,860
Instead of treating it like you're
moving to a foreign, I don't know.

1321
01:16:51,861 --> 01:16:54,410
That's its own nation, man. They've
got their own shit going on over there.

1322
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,890
It should be. It should be. You know,

1323
01:16:57,050 --> 01:16:59,870
it should be like we have like
cousin nations, like Puerto Rico.

1324
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:04,160
Puerto Rico is like, are you, are you
planning a, an exodus out of here?

1325
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,550
I tried to while ago. Man, where were
you going to go? I moved to Colorado.

1326
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:08,480
I got a house.

1327
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:12,650
I leased it instead of buying it just
because the check is this manager's like

1328
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:16,190
flesh. He says, please just check it out
for a little bit. Save your money kid.

1329
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:19,130
Right. Saving for a rainy
day. You know, I'm like,

1330
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:20,360
let's buy a house in the mountains.

1331
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:24,860
So it was a on the top of a mountain and
my dog got eaten by Mountain Lion. Whoa.

1332
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:28,370
Yeah. That'd became a bit in my
act. And if you play in the podcast,

1333
01:17:28,371 --> 01:17:33,290
drinking game drink, shit, it became a
bit in my act, but it really, it was true.

1334
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:36,590
I really did see a mountain
lion in my yard. I was on a,

1335
01:17:36,591 --> 01:17:41,591
it was a huge piece of land right on
the top of the mountain above boulder.

1336
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:45,590
You're going to solve a lot of problems
with me right now. This when fault.

1337
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:49,190
It was, um, well my daughter,

1338
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,350
my second daughter was conceived up there,

1339
01:17:51,351 --> 01:17:55,790
so it was about three years ago
because I have that fantasy of like,

1340
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:59,420
fuck la, fuck the traffic. Fuck
this. I just got to get away.

1341
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:03,440
But then I realized I fucking hate nature.
I have,

1342
01:18:03,470 --> 01:18:06,260
I don't know how he is a thing. I
don't know. To kill a mountain lion,

1343
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,600
the nature is not the issue.

1344
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:13,100
The issue is you have to
understand where you're at.

1345
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:15,980
You have to understand your environment
and you have to have the resources to

1346
01:18:15,981 --> 01:18:19,370
make your environment compatible to you.
You have those resources.

1347
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:23,140
You're not like a regular person living
in the mountain riding a donkey to work.

1348
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,870
Right? Okay. So you've got some
cash. You could hire someone,

1349
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,410
apply your fucking driveway,

1350
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:31,280
you could hire someone to put
motion detector lights on.

1351
01:18:31,281 --> 01:18:33,380
So if there's mountain lions
creeping in your backyard,

1352
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:36,800
the lights hit him and they
run away. Right? You could,
you could protect yourself.

1353
01:18:36,801 --> 01:18:39,610
So then what happened with you? Why
did you, my wife got pregnant. And uh,

1354
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:42,270
when you're up in the mountains,
it's an extremely high out too.

1355
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:47,280
We were at 8,600 feet above sea level
and it's hard walking up a flight of

1356
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:50,000
stairs, right? And when you get
pregnant, it's actually dangerous.

1357
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:52,830
It's dangerous to, the fetus is
not good. So you're like, fuck,

1358
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:54,560
I got to get it out of there.
And yeah,

1359
01:18:54,561 --> 01:18:58,400
and she's not so good at driving in snow
or would you go back now? Fuck yeah.

1360
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:02,300
Fuck yeah. I would live in
maybe the city of boulder a lot.

1361
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:05,960
I think the city of Boulder's a better
mood or was it right in the foothills?

1362
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:07,630
Are you from originally?
No,

1363
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:11,790
I was born in New Jersey and I grew up
most of my life in Boston. Okay, so,

1364
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:16,250
so what is it you're just done with
la? No, it's just that I'm, I love La.

1365
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:19,640
There's a lot of la that I love.
Here's what I love about La.

1366
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:22,580
I think the coolest fucking human beings
I've ever met in my life live here.

1367
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:27,400
Right. You know, I mean, I
just met you today, but I
think it's pretty bad ass. Yo.

1368
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,720
She's cool as fuck.
These two guys are okay.

1369
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:33,770
All my friends live here
except for Stan hope.

1370
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:35,900
Like all my favorite comedians live here.

1371
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:41,090
Joey D as an Ra should fear and
Duncan Trussell and Greg, Eddie Bravo.

1372
01:19:41,090 --> 01:19:44,840
It's like I know so many people in La
that I love that this is where my family

1373
01:19:44,841 --> 01:19:48,580
is. It's not just where my family
of people that I live with, it's my,

1374
01:19:48,581 --> 01:19:53,210
my family of humans that I love.
They're all in la. However,

1375
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:54,860
this is a stupid place to stay.

1376
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:58,280
And if we can get all the people that
I love and everybody was like, listen,

1377
01:19:58,281 --> 01:20:00,520
I love you. You love me. Let's get
the fuck out of here. Right, right.

1378
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:04,430
Why don't we have to play to be in a
place in this 20 million people on the

1379
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:06,620
fucking highway and there's
nothing cool to look at.

1380
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:10,980
The beautiful thing about Colorado
to me was the natural beauty.

1381
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,600
And that to me is like,

1382
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:17,390
it gives me a feeling that like your
artwork is awesome. I love your artwork.

1383
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:20,610
Beautiful. You're very talented,
you're very expressive and you know,

1384
01:20:20,611 --> 01:20:23,280
just you talking to you as a human being.
I love,

1385
01:20:23,490 --> 01:20:25,680
I love when I meet someone
and they're intelligent.

1386
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,670
And you could see that intelligence
expressed in a form of art.

1387
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:34,500
And that's why people love art. You
know, people love art because like,

1388
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:36,340
I can't play music. I don't, I don't,

1389
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,960
I don't know anything about how
to play any instrument at all.

1390
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:43,680
So I love music because it's, to
me, it's like something I can't do.

1391
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:47,760
So I watched it. I'm like,
wow, that's amazing. And it's
so inspirational, exciting,

1392
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:51,570
and I can take it in and almost
has as an infant tile level,

1393
01:20:51,650 --> 01:20:53,990
what does that say about Yoshi?
That he doesn't, he's a master.

1394
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:54,950
He doesn't listen to music.

1395
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:57,790
Neither does Doug. Stan hope. And I love
him to death. I love the weird thing,

1396
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:01,860
whatever. It's life. But my point
was, but well, let me just finish,

1397
01:21:01,861 --> 01:21:04,140
go full circle with this,
is that in Colorado,

1398
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:09,260
the natural beauty is so astounding that
everywhere you look you're like, ah,

1399
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,940
oh. Like there was this place
that we used to drive. Um,

1400
01:21:12,970 --> 01:21:16,830
we would go up to this area
called Nederland and you
drive through the mountains

1401
01:21:16,831 --> 01:21:19,470
to get there. And as you're
driving through the mountains,

1402
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:22,050
like you can't even believe
you're allowed to be here.

1403
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:27,280
You're just seeing the snow covered
peaks in these giant dropoffs and fucking

1404
01:21:27,601 --> 01:21:30,810
trees everywhere.
And it's just majestic.

1405
01:21:30,811 --> 01:21:35,080
And the clouds float overhead and you
realize like this is God's country, right?

1406
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,460
Like you,
you are witnessing the,

1407
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:41,160
the impact of your
environment is substantial.

1408
01:21:41,190 --> 01:21:44,910
It's the idea that we should only measure
things that you could fuck a put on a

1409
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:45,450
scale.

1410
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:50,450
That's what you're not counting in is
the visual benefit you get from seeing

1411
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:54,900
art. That's why people buy art or they
love art. They love having it there.

1412
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,200
There's also art in nature and that's,
that's reality.

1413
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:00,760
If you live in a place that's
boring as fuck to look at, right?

1414
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:05,370
It's not inspirational. But when
you're in Colorado and you're driving,

1415
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,050
you're driving up Sunshine Canyon.
He loves Colorado's driving around.

1416
01:22:09,051 --> 01:22:12,660
He's fucking trees and mountains that
the same thing can be said about northern

1417
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:13,550
California,
right?

1418
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:17,550
If you go like to Humboldt drive
around Humboldt drive around the,

1419
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,410
where the sequoia national forest is,

1420
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:24,230
they have these giant redwood trees
and he was like, God damn like Tahoe,

1421
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,820
go to Tahoe,
see the fucking mountains,

1422
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,110
look at all those trees and the
look at the giant lake and just say,

1423
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,490
you take it in

1424
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:37,410
Colorado in every spot you just named.
I love it too. Like it's I, yeah,

1425
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:41,130
it's fucking breathtaking. It's
upset. It's just two weeks,

1426
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:44,610
two whites, you know, God damn.
There's a lot of white people.

1427
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,640
If you had a dance contest in Colorado,
they would call it off.

1428
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,630
It's just the middle of the night.
They would say, no one wins. It's this.

1429
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,140
It's this completely like,

1430
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:57,110
it just makes me, I guess, a
little bit uncomfortable, you know?

1431
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,910
I could totally understand that.
That's why I got to Hawaii.

1432
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:04,380
It's got the natural beauty and it's
diverse enough where that's a good point,

1433
01:23:04,381 --> 01:23:06,050
you know, and the, yeah,

1434
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:10,000
that's a good point. I could see that.
The only problem with Hawaii's, his land,

1435
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:14,300
it's locked. It's just like it's a
small piece of land. There's not a lot,

1436
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:19,120
dude. The volcanoes are an issue only
on the big island. Really. I mean,

1437
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:22,240
it could look a volcano.
The real volcano issue was Yellowstone,

1438
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:23,590
and if that mother fucker goes,

1439
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:27,600
you're better off being on Hawaii than
you are in California. Right. Yellowstone.

1440
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:31,960
And it was essentially the pregnancy
that got you out of Colorado. Yes.

1441
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:37,020
If she wasn't, then you probably stay,
I don't know, man. The loser. No,

1442
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:38,890
I see.
I grew up in Boston,

1443
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,970
my formative years from
13 to 24. Right. And I,

1444
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:47,530
I had a newspaper route when I was a kid
when I had a car. Right. And it was, uh,

1445
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:51,160
I was fighting in taekwondo tournament's
all I did was delivering newspapers in

1446
01:23:51,161 --> 01:23:55,750
the morning and then in the afternoon
and then compete. So I drove every day.

1447
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,320
Right. So I drove in a lot of snow.
Right. So for me, driving in snow,

1448
01:23:59,321 --> 01:24:03,220
it's just second nature.
I knew how to handle that shit.

1449
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:06,740
I knew what it's like to get stuck.
I got stuck every year, you know,

1450
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:10,540
it didn't freak me out. I've walked miles
home. Car was in the ditch, you know,

1451
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:13,720
because it's spun out on the highway.
I've done it, I did all that shit. Right.

1452
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:16,680
And when you grow up in a
place like Massachusetts, you,

1453
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:20,950
you experienced that fucking ruthless
weather and you get just, it,

1454
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:22,660
just accept it so that,

1455
01:24:22,661 --> 01:24:27,661
that 10 plus years of my life is in my
brain and I just pull that cartridge out

1456
01:24:27,851 --> 01:24:28,900
and shove it in there.

1457
01:24:28,901 --> 01:24:33,190
But my wife is from Texas and when she's
never driven in snow before and all of

1458
01:24:33,191 --> 01:24:34,024
a sudden she's like,

1459
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:40,140
she doesn't know what the fuck to do when
the ass end goes. Right, right, right. No,

1460
01:24:40,150 --> 01:24:42,350
I know.
You got to spin into that shit.

1461
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:45,910
You gotta you gotta I know how to
balance a car when it starts to slide.

1462
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:49,360
And even then you've got to accept the
fact that you can't deal with black eyes.

1463
01:24:49,361 --> 01:24:52,900
He hit black ice. You're going to crash.
Right. I have all these things in my head,

1464
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,600
but to a person who's never
grown up in cold weather,

1465
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,320
that's a terrifying variable that
you've just added to the equation.

1466
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:01,320
Well,
black freeze to death.

1467
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:03,330
The black guys get really
angry when you try to hit them.

1468
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:05,820
That black hat and a
black guy, oh, black ice,

1469
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:10,840
black ice [inaudible]
you've never driven on a uh,

1470
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:16,430
like a a road and it rained
and it like black guy.

1471
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,760
I was like,
just try to hit black guys in Colorado.

1472
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:30,120
Have you ever driven on black ice? No.
It's the most terrifying shit ever.

1473
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,540
You're driving and then all of a sudden
the road goes out from under you and you

1474
01:25:33,541 --> 01:25:34,380
start spinning.

1475
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:39,750
Have you ever driven on like a northern
road in the winter? No, fucking day.

1476
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,070
That's the thing,
man.

1477
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:45,840
That's why I was saying I have this
like fantasy of like fucking la and then

1478
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:50,580
these visions of like this
post apocalyptic like riots
and fires and I'm like

1479
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:55,940
just get out and then I realize I don't
know shit about wilderness and nature

1480
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:58,420
and driving learn, learn, all that. That

1481
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:02,300
shit you could learn all that shit. The,
the, the driving in the snow is difficult,

1482
01:26:02,301 --> 01:26:03,950
but people have done,
they've moved from cow.

1483
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:08,390
A lot of people move from California to
boulder right after the 94 earthquake.

1484
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:11,750
93 earthquakes. Yeah, that's about
right. Whatever it was that big earth,

1485
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:16,520
the Northridge earthquake,
when your instinct is to go colder,

1486
01:26:16,521 --> 01:26:20,330
mountainous and I think mine would
be to go South America. I, you know,

1487
01:26:20,331 --> 01:26:22,070
growing up in Boston does I,

1488
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:25,310
there's something that I appreciate
about cold weather because it gives you a

1489
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:29,530
certain respect for the possibilities that
mother nature can throw at you. Right.

1490
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:33,350
On a regular basis and it
sounds ridiculous to one and
put yourself through that.

1491
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,243
All right.

1492
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:39,170
And when I was young I s I was mostly
was a person who sought comfort,

1493
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,410
so I wanted to get out of the snow
and get out of the all that as much as

1494
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:44,990
possible and find a nice place
so I could take a nap or it.

1495
01:26:44,990 --> 01:26:49,100
As I've got older I realized that that
is one that's one of the things that sort

1496
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:53,870
of steals you as a human being is
overcoming adversity and dealing with

1497
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:58,490
difficult situations. I think it's,
it's good to know that winter's coming.

1498
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:03,170
Do you like traveling overseas? Yeah, I
don't mind it. I don't like plane flights.

1499
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:06,650
I love, I love going to different
cultures or plane flights are just such a

1500
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:10,790
motherfucker,
but I love being in any new cultures.

1501
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:16,130
So it's so interesting to me that
people can develop, you know,

1502
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:20,780
on the same planet in different areas
geographically and have completely

1503
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:25,150
different sets of values and ideals.
And I love comparing their,

1504
01:27:25,151 --> 01:27:28,680
their takes on family and politics.

1505
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:30,200
It's fascinating to me.

1506
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:35,530
Endlessly endlessly fascinating to me
that we can all exist in 2013 but be very,

1507
01:27:35,721 --> 01:27:36,830
very,
very different.

1508
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:40,440
That's why ensign on the
podcast last night was talking
a lot about Japan, right?

1509
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,550
We were talking about Japanese culture
and why he loves it so much and the

1510
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:44,660
Japanese people and how,

1511
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:49,930
how well they responded to the Fukushima
incident and all those people orderly

1512
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:54,830
in line waiting for, you know,
for aid. You know, it's crazy.

1513
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:59,390
Japanese are the only ones in all
of Asia that will wait in line.

1514
01:27:59,630 --> 01:28:01,560
So disappointed everyone else's

1515
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,350
because there's a social
contract with everyone, you know?

1516
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:07,730
And I'm not saying that our culture
is socks and their cultures better.

1517
01:28:07,731 --> 01:28:09,210
I'm not saying that at all.
I mean,

1518
01:28:09,211 --> 01:28:12,500
and people get real nationalistic and
really a lot of people had gotten upset

1519
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:15,560
with me about a lot of the things that
I've said about America on the podcast.

1520
01:28:15,561 --> 01:28:19,940
And they say a lot of silly shit.
I'm not saying,

1521
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,040
I'm not saying I'm not, I don't believe
I believe in, I believe in human.

1522
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:28,190
I believe in the concepts of of nations.
And in that sense,

1523
01:28:28,191 --> 01:28:31,520
I love the concept of America more than
any nation in the world other than the

1524
01:28:31,521 --> 01:28:33,320
military industrial complex.
Actually,

1525
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:34,161
I don't know,

1526
01:28:34,161 --> 01:28:38,300
remember that when the earthquake was 93
[inaudible] 94 but people surprise me,

1527
01:28:38,301 --> 01:28:41,240
they were helping each other out
planned. I mean, they were amazing.

1528
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:43,670
The people that who usually
don't like each other,

1529
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,180
they sit that shit aside and
they were helping each other.

1530
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:49,340
I was listening to a lecture on this
and there's something funny about the

1531
01:28:49,341 --> 01:28:50,200
complexities of

1532
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:55,000
human behavior and emotions and
it's like a, it's like, you know,

1533
01:28:55,001 --> 01:28:58,600
when people are like, hey, how
come is it possible? Are we not?

1534
01:28:58,930 --> 01:29:02,370
Can we not be happy and sad at the
same time? Right. Yeah. So the,

1535
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,480
the earthquake happened, right? Yeah. And
it just shook the shit out of my house.

1536
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:10,490
Like my cousin almost got flattened
by like this giant dresser. And, um,

1537
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,320
I lived on a street with
a lot of old people,

1538
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,730
so me and my brother went and we went
around the block helping all these old

1539
01:29:17,731 --> 01:29:19,700
people turn off their
gas line so that there,

1540
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:23,390
there was an old couple trying to find
their gas line with, with a lighter on it.

1541
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:28,920
And so we went around the whole block and
we with the flashlight and then we made

1542
01:29:28,921 --> 01:29:31,470
sure everyone had their gas
line off so that you know,

1543
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:34,980
the neighborhood wouldn't explode. And
then after that, then we wouldn't looting.

1544
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:42,370
I'm on your fucking,
that's insurance is for,

1545
01:29:42,371 --> 01:29:43,151
I'm on your team.

1546
01:29:43,151 --> 01:29:47,410
You did the right thing for humanity and
you took advantage of a disenfranchised

1547
01:29:47,411 --> 01:29:51,610
situation you found yourself in because
of the inequities of the situation that

1548
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:54,490
the different system, this is
what we operate under, right?

1549
01:29:54,491 --> 01:29:56,260
And they're going to make lock
down. I didn't know that. Yeah.

1550
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,810
We want to make sure everyone's
all right neighborhoods cool.

1551
01:29:58,811 --> 01:30:01,630
And then go get some fucking
dean equities of the situation.

1552
01:30:01,631 --> 01:30:04,300
You find yourself in a forced
you to drastic actions.

1553
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:07,600
There's nothing wrong with what you did.
You did the right thing humanly.

1554
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:11,650
He humanitarian wise with your
friends. Yeah. Good for you man.

1555
01:30:12,160 --> 01:30:15,400
I was listening to a lecture on this
very subject today on the way over here.

1556
01:30:15,401 --> 01:30:20,401
It just coincidentally
completely coincidentally and
the guy was saying that the

1557
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:20,950
um,

1558
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:25,720
one of the issues that we have with
modern culture and the attitude of modern

1559
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:26,351
society,

1560
01:30:26,351 --> 01:30:31,000
when you watch like the Kardashians show
or you watch like nonsensical bullshit

1561
01:30:31,001 --> 01:30:35,830
on TV or worse yourself. Yeah. And
the, the sort of culture of gossip.

1562
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:41,400
The reason for that is because we are
in a situation where we have massive

1563
01:30:41,621 --> 01:30:46,360
abundance of resources where everyone can
get gas on every corner and you can go

1564
01:30:46,361 --> 01:30:49,910
to a store of choice, even if you're
poor, you can't afford fatty foods. Right?

1565
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:51,970
So that, that, that, that,

1566
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:57,020
that lack of need for character and lack
of need for any sort of real drastic

1567
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,390
effort to overcome your environment.

1568
01:31:01,391 --> 01:31:06,391
Like everybody else all over the world
allows us to get really fucking conti and

1569
01:31:06,581 --> 01:31:11,581
really stupid and soft and lazy because
we only have to do as much work as we,

1570
01:31:12,701 --> 01:31:15,040
you know,
we need to survival and survival is easy.

1571
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:20,110
Then your brain is left to fucking dwell
on stupid shit like the Kardashians or

1572
01:31:20,111 --> 01:31:22,570
like, you know, who wore
this dress better or why,

1573
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:25,390
why is this guy have a car like that?
And I got this piece of Shit,

1574
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:29,690
you know, I call it the toilet paper
situation. So going back to the Congo,

1575
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:34,430
when I was in the Congo, I realized a lot
of places they don't have toilet paper.

1576
01:31:34,431 --> 01:31:39,380
Like even in like just public restroom and
stuff. And for those who don't know, I,

1577
01:31:39,381 --> 01:31:40,550
I need to shit a lot.

1578
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:41,633
Yeah.

1579
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:44,550
Like I need to shit all the time.

1580
01:31:44,551 --> 01:31:47,310
And especially in a country like
that where shit is definitely coming.

1581
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,673
Aye.

1582
01:31:49,450 --> 01:31:52,930
Well I went to their version of a
supermarket, which was just sparse.

1583
01:31:52,931 --> 01:31:57,190
They had nothing. And I was like,
I need that Congo Brazzaville,

1584
01:31:57,191 --> 01:32:00,610
the city part before I went into
the jungle. So I went in and,

1585
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:04,450
and you go to the section and you go,
where's the toilet paper?

1586
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:07,600
And there's a toilet paper, it's just
there. And then you're like, okay,

1587
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:09,970
it's just a thing of toilet
paper when you buy it.

1588
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:15,300
And then reflecting later on when I'm
here and I go to Ralph's and I'm standing

1589
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:17,020
in the aisle of the toilet paper,

1590
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:21,460
there's like 50 different brands
is to apply for, apply quilted,

1591
01:32:21,490 --> 01:32:24,850
sent it unscented. And you're
just sitting there and I'm like,

1592
01:32:25,060 --> 01:32:29,020
which one should I get? Like, which one
will be feel the best on my asshole,

1593
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,160
you know?
And then

1594
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:34,260
the next thing you realize you're like,
I just spent like 10 minutes, you know,

1595
01:32:34,261 --> 01:32:37,410
thinking about something that most people
will never have to like think about

1596
01:32:37,411 --> 01:32:41,760
and you know, like it's, and then you have
all this extra time like, yeah, it makes,

1597
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:44,110
well that's why people
look down on Americans.

1598
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:47,530
They look down in Americans is where
supposedly at the peak of the abundance

1599
01:32:47,531 --> 01:32:51,550
pyramid right now we're
the most ridiculous as far
as our consumption and our

1600
01:32:51,551 --> 01:32:56,230
attitude towards consumerism and
material possessions that we eclipse.

1601
01:32:56,340 --> 01:33:00,310
We eclipse the rest of the world and our
ridiculousness and then as evidence of

1602
01:33:00,311 --> 01:33:04,690
that we provide to this reality television
culture that is sweeping the nation

1603
01:33:04,720 --> 01:33:09,040
and it's just more and more ridiculous
attention focused on people that are

1604
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:11,440
completely undeserving of
it and well why is that?

1605
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:15,340
Why is that coming from America and well
most likely because we're the ones with

1606
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:17,110
the most guns were the biggest bullies.

1607
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:19,140
Whether they're the ones who control them,
the the,

1608
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:21,820
the military aspect of the
majority of the country,

1609
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:23,560
the majority of the world rather.

1610
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:28,510
And because of that we the people that
sit here in the balls of the Dick,

1611
01:33:28,511 --> 01:33:33,100
that's fucking the world we are,
we're weak or we're soft,

1612
01:33:33,200 --> 01:33:35,530
we're weak bitches.
That's why we appreciate character.

1613
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:36,550
We appreciate when someone,

1614
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:40,710
we appreciate survivorman which used to
be like everyday life a hundred years

1615
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:43,240
ago.
We appreciate the idea that as well,

1616
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:45,160
he goes to the fucking
jungle for seven days.

1617
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,840
People live in the jungle all year
round. Okay. That's their life.

1618
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:54,640
Like we are so weak that like a day
without food is what did you do?

1619
01:33:54,670 --> 01:33:57,190
But that's most of the world has.

1620
01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:00,730
There's many days where you're not going
to find something to eat and you're

1621
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:04,630
going to get desperate and then you're
going to get some ingenuity together to

1622
01:34:04,631 --> 01:34:06,500
find something to fucking eat.
Right.

1623
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:10,570
And that's how people survive to get this
far along the evolutionary food chain

1624
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:15,090
in the first place. Right. Yoshi,

1625
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:16,110
which your ass eating,

1626
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,940
the reason why you eating ass,

1627
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:19,760
cause you don't have to go out
there and fish for a living.

1628
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:22,430
I mean Yoshi loves salad.

1629
01:34:22,431 --> 01:34:25,640
You know if you were out there catching
salmon all day to try to feed your

1630
01:34:25,641 --> 01:34:29,840
family in Alaska Souplantation
pasta salad,

1631
01:34:29,841 --> 01:34:31,480
every all you can eat pass other

1632
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,830
favorite and personally I
watched those shows as in Alaska

1633
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:40,400
where they di they build fish wheels.
It's the these,

1634
01:34:40,401 --> 01:34:44,510
this is all these shows where these people
live in Alaska and they just live off

1635
01:34:44,511 --> 01:34:48,290
the land and most of them don't
have any jobs. They just hunting,

1636
01:34:48,291 --> 01:34:50,150
farming and catching fish.

1637
01:34:50,151 --> 01:34:53,840
And then they huddle in for the winter
while they developed this thing called a

1638
01:34:53,841 --> 01:34:58,790
fish wheel and they make it out
of logs and it's huge like net,

1639
01:34:58,791 --> 01:35:01,580
like thing that just
spins with the current.

1640
01:35:01,581 --> 01:35:06,450
It keeps rolling and as it rolls it just
scoops fish out of the water and drown

1641
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:08,570
them into a bucket.
It's really wild.

1642
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:13,610
It's ingenious because they invented
this up there independently in Alaska

1643
01:35:14,290 --> 01:35:16,220
hunting well hundreds of years ago,

1644
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:20,720
like who knows when the invention of the
fish wheel was. Might've been decades,

1645
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:23,750
whatever. What the fuck do I
know? Alaskan historian? No,

1646
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:26,180
but I'm going there with Ari Shaffir.
We're going there. This spread.

1647
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:28,160
Check this out.
Joe Settled Down Anchorage.

1648
01:35:28,161 --> 01:35:30,590
We're on our way to
figuring out how to do this.

1649
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:33,740
We're going to do this on the day
where you guys have the most salmon,

1650
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:37,280
whatever that part of the year is because
Ari and I are going to do one show and

1651
01:35:37,281 --> 01:35:37,820
then go salmon.

1652
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:39,650
Definitely figure out when the,

1653
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:44,240
like that fishing season is or when
it's close to the end because that trip,

1654
01:35:44,241 --> 01:35:47,540
the vice showed the thumbs up when
I hitchhiked from Tijuana to Alaska.

1655
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:49,640
When we got to Alaska.
This,

1656
01:35:49,690 --> 01:35:52,040
do you think that they would
have hot strippers and Alaska?

1657
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:58,200
I would assume that if I was a stripper
and I wanted to make some real money and

1658
01:35:58,670 --> 01:35:59,710
evolves ambitious,

1659
01:35:59,711 --> 01:36:03,460
I would fly to where there's no
checks and that's where Alaska is.

1660
01:36:03,550 --> 01:36:06,730
This is what her ex or this is what
happens in Alaska. Ruthless bitches,

1661
01:36:06,731 --> 01:36:07,564
these girls,

1662
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:11,100
these ruthless bitches that are smart
and ambitious and willing to go to

1663
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:13,190
place where you could freeze to death.
You know these guys,

1664
01:36:13,191 --> 01:36:14,750
they go out on the boats were months,
right?

1665
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,960
And then they catch all these like
crazy fish and crabs and whatever.

1666
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:21,200
And then they come back and they get
paid like 20 grand cash or whatever.

1667
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:25,460
And then what do they do? They go straight
to the Strip club. So these girls,

1668
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:30,440
they figure it out to go to, you know,
a strip club in anchorage or whatever.

1669
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:32,270
And so when I went,

1670
01:36:32,271 --> 01:36:34,970
the chicks are like the hottest chicks
ever and none of them are from Alaska.

1671
01:36:34,971 --> 01:36:37,230
They just flew in for fishing season.
Fucking

1672
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:41,270
mercenaries. Mercenaries. Oh, I love it.

1673
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:45,140
I love that human ingenuity, man. That's
figuring out the fish wheel. They,

1674
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:47,210
these bitches invented official wheel.
They're like,

1675
01:36:47,211 --> 01:36:49,850
why are we wasting our time in Bismarck,
South Dakota?

1676
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:52,910
We can't make a Nicole when you can find
out Alaska and these motherfuckers have

1677
01:36:52,911 --> 01:36:55,580
money and they're horny
as shit and you just go,

1678
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:58,290
how many of those goes turn tricks?
Uh,

1679
01:36:58,930 --> 01:37:02,620
I have no idea. They probably don't have
to. Yeah. I mean these guys are like,

1680
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:03,310
they're just,

1681
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:07,570
they've just been around fish and other
men on a little tiny boat for like months

1682
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:10,470
jeans on. They probably
shoot, right? Yeah.

1683
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:13,320
They got those slickers on
and they're shooting pants.

1684
01:37:13,321 --> 01:37:14,790
They were like thick rubber and whatever.

1685
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:18,120
I couldn't imagine what it's like to be
on a boat from months with a bunch of

1686
01:37:18,121 --> 01:37:23,010
dudes unless you were gay because the
eye for this day. But the idea of no,

1687
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:27,030
no sex at all for months and months
at a time. Why am I doing this? Oh,

1688
01:37:27,031 --> 01:37:29,370
because I'm going to catch crabs
can get the fuck outta here.

1689
01:37:29,371 --> 01:37:33,660
I'm not catching it.
I don't have that kind of time.

1690
01:37:34,060 --> 01:37:38,090
Hey Joe, let me ask you.
Um, I, I was watching, uh,

1691
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:43,300
the DMT experience on Netflix and you
were the DMT, the spirit molecule.

1692
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:46,780
Yeah. Yeah. So you've
done it before. Oh yeah.

1693
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:50,500
Like are you done with it
or you keep doing it? Um,

1694
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:54,340
the real problem, that
discussion, okay. Is that DMT is,

1695
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:57,330
I did it for the first last
year incredibly illegal.

1696
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:02,350
And when you start talking about
continuing to do it, then people go, well,

1697
01:38:02,351 --> 01:38:05,500
where are you getting this? Right,
right, right. If anybody finds anybody,

1698
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,620
it just became illegal.
Right now it's been illegal for a,

1699
01:38:08,621 --> 01:38:11,550
was made illegal in the sweeping act of,

1700
01:38:11,551 --> 01:38:14,070
I think it was 1970
[inaudible] psychedelic sacked.

1701
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:18,180
But what's interesting
is that five Meo DMT,

1702
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:19,403
which is

1703
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:22,540
well, just as powerful.
I think gram for gram,

1704
01:38:22,541 --> 01:38:27,541
it's more potent than n and dimethyl
tree DMT is dimethyltryptamine this five

1705
01:38:27,821 --> 01:38:30,670
meo shit used to be legal.
We used to buy it on the Internet.

1706
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:34,030
He's feel a biologic up
bucket of it for like it was,

1707
01:38:34,060 --> 01:38:38,980
it wasn't that much and you only need
like a pinch of that stuff and you get

1708
01:38:38,981 --> 01:38:41,140
blasted to the center of the university.

1709
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:44,620
So while marijuana was
illegal or a good order,

1710
01:38:44,621 --> 01:38:49,420
DMT online,
like the first time I did DMT,

1711
01:38:49,421 --> 01:38:53,290
I did five meo and I did it with a bunch
of friends and one of them ordered it

1712
01:38:53,291 --> 01:38:54,580
online,
he ordered it,

1713
01:38:55,110 --> 01:38:58,150
he brought her over my house and he had
like a fucking container, this shit.

1714
01:38:58,151 --> 01:39:01,240
And we're like, where'd you get
this? He goes, I got it online work,

1715
01:39:02,650 --> 01:39:05,320
you could just buy it
online and is it real?

1716
01:39:05,321 --> 01:39:08,860
And he smoked it and got blasted to the
center of the universe. And I was like,

1717
01:39:08,861 --> 01:39:10,150
okay,
am I next?

1718
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:14,740
And we all sat around on my couch and I
had a remote control for the lights and

1719
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:17,980
we would hit it and then there was like
four of us in the room. It would hit it.

1720
01:39:17,981 --> 01:39:20,560
And then, um, when the
guy took a hit, boom,

1721
01:39:20,561 --> 01:39:22,540
I would hit the lights and
the lights would go off.

1722
01:39:22,810 --> 01:39:27,130
And like 10 minutes later the next dude
would hit it. Well, it was pretty intense.

1723
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:30,490
It was a really a unique experience.
How long does it last? No.

1724
01:39:30,491 --> 01:39:35,080
More than like 10 minutes.
Yeah, five minutes. No,

1725
01:39:35,081 --> 01:39:39,310
I have not done that, but I'm going
with the, well, we made plans to go.

1726
01:39:39,311 --> 01:39:42,080
Dennis Mckenna wants to take, you should
take this. Go with you. I'll take you.

1727
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:46,360
I want to go. Yo. Dave did it. Where would
you do it, Yoshi? If you go out, we'll do.

1728
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:49,480
Okay. Were, were you going to let us film
it all? Well, you want to be with us.

1729
01:39:49,481 --> 01:39:52,850
We'll film it. Yes, please.
You'll be a part of it. Fun.

1730
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:56,180
I had never done drugs my entire life.
I'm 36 I had never done it.

1731
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:58,810
Might want to come with us. Were
you going to go? I don't know.

1732
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,530
I think we're going to go to Peru.
I went to Columbia to do it.

1733
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:02,970
Yeah.

1734
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:07,190
The the selling point for me was the guy
that was like my therapist at the time.

1735
01:40:07,191 --> 01:40:10,100
It was like, he's like, I
could tell you are like,

1736
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:13,400
you will have a very short attention
span. You get like, you know,

1737
01:40:13,401 --> 01:40:15,860
bored with things very easily.
Like you know,

1738
01:40:15,861 --> 01:40:18,910
we could make some progress with you just
through like normal therapy and this,

1739
01:40:18,950 --> 01:40:21,290
these kinds of things
over the course of years.

1740
01:40:21,650 --> 01:40:25,520
Or you can have 10 years of psychotherapy
and one night where you experience

1741
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:27,770
like all these things. And I was
like, yeah, what? What does that,

1742
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:32,420
and he's told me it was Iowasca so
then I went to do it in the jungle in

1743
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:34,640
Columbia with him and it was exactly that.

1744
01:40:34,641 --> 01:40:38,920
I mean it was like completely
like life changing and therapeutic

1745
01:40:39,210 --> 01:40:42,360
Iowasca is a,
an elastic active hours.

1746
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:44,060
No, it lasted like, well,

1747
01:40:44,061 --> 01:40:47,120
I had never done anything so it lasted
for me more than any of the other,

1748
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:49,520
other people there.
But yeah,

1749
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:54,040
I mean fuck if you took
Yoshi all this fucking

1750
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:58,780
darkness inside of him, maybe
curious age, you know, I know Yoshi,

1751
01:40:58,781 --> 01:41:01,680
I think Yoshi is a beautiful person.
He is a beautiful person.

1752
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:06,580
He had some bad circumstances as a
young man and he reacted to those

1753
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:10,900
circumstances. But outside of
that, he's a great guy. But I,

1754
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:11,920
when I see Yoshi,

1755
01:41:11,921 --> 01:41:15,980
I see a guy who was born into a situation
that he had no control over and he

1756
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:18,790
reacted accordingly. Right? The,

1757
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:22,900
the idea of a Iosco being,
um,

1758
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:27,530
like a one day fix it,
it's kind of tricky, right?
Because it might not fix you.

1759
01:41:27,531 --> 01:41:31,110
It might just freaky the fuck out and
bring you back to the drawing board and,

1760
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:35,980
and cause psychological state
instability. Also. I'm really dumb.

1761
01:41:36,010 --> 01:41:40,110
Can you explain to me like, I don't
know exactly what it is. Okay. Um,

1762
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:44,830
DMT is dimethyltryptamine and it's the,

1763
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,520
it's produced in a bunch
of different organs.

1764
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:52,060
We know that the liver produces it,
the lungs produce it.

1765
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:58,290
They believe it's also produced by the
brain in a gland called the pineal gland.

1766
01:41:58,630 --> 01:42:01,090
The evidence for that is disputed.

1767
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:05,680
It's kind of more anecdotal than anything,
but in eastern mysticism,

1768
01:42:05,681 --> 01:42:10,540
like all of the images of the third
eye or that, that is the pineal gland.

1769
01:42:10,541 --> 01:42:14,470
Like if you see like all
these different like um, uh,

1770
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,530
like deities with the gland,
third eye,

1771
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:23,650
the chemical I think they say is produced
when you dream and then when you're

1772
01:42:23,651 --> 01:42:26,710
born and when you die. Well,
during heavy rem sleep,

1773
01:42:26,711 --> 01:42:31,150
they believe your brain produces more of
it and they also believe that it might

1774
01:42:31,151 --> 01:42:33,670
be responsible for alien abductions.

1775
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:38,671
There's a lot of theories about that
because DMT is produced during rem sleep

1776
01:42:39,101 --> 01:42:42,670
and most of the alien abduction
experiences occur at night.

1777
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:44,710
And the idea as well,
the will,

1778
01:42:44,711 --> 01:42:48,910
you're saying these people are dreaming
but they know it really happened. No,

1779
01:42:49,060 --> 01:42:54,060
I'm saying it doesn't mean either or
just because they're having these crazy

1780
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:58,780
fucked up experiences doesn't mean that
crazy fucked up experiences isn't a

1781
01:42:58,781 --> 01:42:59,614
reality.

1782
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:04,950
It just might be an ethereal reality
and some alternative dimension and it's

1783
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:08,320
only accessible through chemicals
and that is a possibility.

1784
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,410
The possibility that everything
you experience, look,

1785
01:43:11,411 --> 01:43:14,890
even if you experience a dream that's
profound, it's still an experience.

1786
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:18,490
What is happening in that dream that
becomes so profound that you sort of see

1787
01:43:18,491 --> 01:43:21,750
things in a different way. You're having
some sort of an experience, you're,

1788
01:43:21,751 --> 01:43:23,890
you're taking in information,

1789
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:27,910
there's no unique ones and Zeros that
are entering into your mind that are

1790
01:43:27,911 --> 01:43:31,990
allowing you to form a new
version of the world. Well, the,

1791
01:43:31,991 --> 01:43:36,390
when the drug experience under DMT,
which is again the,

1792
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:40,340
or you know, the, the quicker
acting form of viral Alaska, the,

1793
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,750
they know the act of contents
and I osca whatever that is,

1794
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:48,700
is a very potent experience.
Real or not, it's silly to judge,

1795
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:51,770
right. The idea that you can't hit
it with a hammer, so it's not real.

1796
01:43:51,771 --> 01:43:54,260
You can't put it on a scale.
So it's not real. Yeah.

1797
01:43:54,400 --> 01:43:58,600
Measure it with a ruler to me is why it
was life changing because I could have a

1798
01:43:58,601 --> 01:44:01,000
dream and I'll be like,
oh,

1799
01:44:01,001 --> 01:44:05,920
I felt like I just dreamt that I flew.
Right. Yeah. But like Joe saying,

1800
01:44:05,921 --> 01:44:09,950
this thing makes you actually feel
like you had just flown like, like,

1801
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:13,810
so I'll ask him, make it's the same thing.
Well, you know, it's like people say,

1802
01:44:13,811 --> 01:44:14,860
well,
it wasn't real.

1803
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,410
It doesn't matter.
It's exactly the same as if it was real.

1804
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,380
Let's be very scientific here.

1805
01:44:21,381 --> 01:44:26,381
Let's say you were having a hallucination
and that hallucination lasted one hour

1806
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:29,420
and in that one hour,

1807
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:34,720
this chemical perturbed your normal sense
of visual stimulation and the input to

1808
01:44:35,781 --> 01:44:38,390
the mind and it gave you a distorted
perception of reality, right?

1809
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:41,040
And then let's say,
um,

1810
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:46,150
so let's say that's option a and then
let's say option B is you took a magic

1811
01:44:47,241 --> 01:44:52,241
fairy dust that brought you to an
enchanted land that couldn't have possibly

1812
01:44:52,551 --> 01:44:53,810
been accessed without it.

1813
01:44:53,960 --> 01:44:58,960
And in that world you communicated with
impossibly intelligent entities that

1814
01:44:59,121 --> 01:45:03,290
broke down the universe for you in a way
that you could understand in your brief

1815
01:45:03,291 --> 01:45:07,580
time there. And then let's look
at those two things and say,

1816
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:12,320
regardless of which one is true,
they both achieve the exact same result.

1817
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,220
You have the exact same experience,
whether it's,

1818
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:20,770
whether it's preturbing your sense of
visual input to the mind or whether it's

1819
01:45:21,771 --> 01:45:25,640
you really go to a magic fairy land
and communicate with God, right?

1820
01:45:26,060 --> 01:45:27,500
The same thing happens.

1821
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:31,520
You can make noises with your mouth
and use the cultural context of written

1822
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:35,750
language and historical reference to sort
of like put it in a position where you

1823
01:45:35,751 --> 01:45:38,600
can explain it to a group of people
that are not going to make fun of you.

1824
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:42,890
But the reality of it is all
culture aside, all language aside,

1825
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:46,790
all preconceived notions aside, you're
having the same fucking experience. So,

1826
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:50,840
so it was it life changing for you
though? I got a tattoo and I'm like, Whoa,

1827
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:56,000
that's a DMT molecule right there. All
right. Aside from the Tattoo was nothing.

1828
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:59,400
Oh, changed the way I look at
the whole universe. Yeah, me too.

1829
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:03,170
I sort of understand. Um, after, I mean,

1830
01:46:03,171 --> 01:46:05,900
I understand first of all that I don't
really understand any of it, right.

1831
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:09,110
But I understand after
I did it that, um, uh,

1832
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:14,111
my whole idea of the world that I had
used as a reference that I use is like,

1833
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:21,050
this is this and this is that and this
is the banking system and this is the

1834
01:46:21,051 --> 01:46:25,220
government.
It became ridiculous.

1835
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,200
It all became ridiculous.

1836
01:46:27,201 --> 01:46:31,120
And the idea that this could exist
and I couldn't know about it. Right.

1837
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:34,400
And that could have been living my
life. It became infant tile, the whole,

1838
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:39,170
the universe became infant,
toddler, everything, sex, money,

1839
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:43,020
driving it to all be, I mean you're taking
the words right out of my mind. Both.

1840
01:46:43,090 --> 01:46:46,190
I mean it's, it just shows
you the ridiculous, it's,

1841
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:48,130
it was completely life changing for me.

1842
01:46:48,490 --> 01:46:53,490
But here's the danger in it I think is
when I start going off on him because I

1843
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:54,720
didn't get a tattoo of it.

1844
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:58,260
But I'm super passionate about about it
now because it did like completely like

1845
01:46:58,261 --> 01:47:03,261
alter my vision of how I see things is
I started sound like a maniac when I

1846
01:47:04,591 --> 01:47:09,000
started talking about it too much to my
where and when you start talking about

1847
01:47:09,001 --> 01:47:12,030
it and get super passionate about it,
you don't sound crazy.

1848
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:16,410
But then I'm aware of the
perception of like, oh people,

1849
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:18,290
Dave sounds fucking
like a maniac and crazy.

1850
01:47:18,291 --> 01:47:20,320
And he was talking about
this weird drug and then it,

1851
01:47:20,510 --> 01:47:25,510
and then the thing about it is I did it
in Columbia with like 20 other people

1852
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:28,350
who are these 20 other people?
You know,

1853
01:47:28,351 --> 01:47:30,750
it was like this trip
arranged trip and it's like,

1854
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:35,550
it's exactly who you thought they were
like weird hippie type people. You know,

1855
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:40,760
the fact that this thing exists and that
it only attracts these like we're like

1856
01:47:41,161 --> 01:47:42,790
dreadlocked white people.

1857
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:46,830
Fringy people when if
the right people did it,

1858
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:50,640
basically I think everyone should do it.
But if the right people that,

1859
01:47:51,450 --> 01:47:54,180
that didn't hear it in all, man,
that sounds like fucking crazy,

1860
01:47:54,181 --> 01:47:58,140
like hippy bullshit, you know,
it, it could like literally
like change the world.

1861
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,700
Like we could change the consciousness
of the whole plan. Really could.

1862
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:02,410
And that's that it sounds stupid,

1863
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:07,060
especially coming from me because my
credibility is limited me to fear factor.

1864
01:48:07,061 --> 01:48:10,630
And I do cage fighting commentary and
then I do a podcast while under the

1865
01:48:10,631 --> 01:48:14,120
influence of illegal drug. So it's
like, look at all those equation.

1866
01:48:14,170 --> 01:48:17,680
Only illegal federally. Um, why did
you have to go to jungle though?

1867
01:48:17,681 --> 01:48:19,570
Why can't you just cause it's
illegal in the United States.

1868
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:22,000
I didn't even know that schedule one.

1869
01:48:22,001 --> 01:48:25,720
It is one of the most illegal drugs
in the world along with marijuana,

1870
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:30,370
which by the way, the idea of scheduling
one is that it has no medical use,

1871
01:48:30,580 --> 01:48:34,240
which is hilarious because there is
medical marijuana approved in California.

1872
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:37,720
It's been proved beyond a shadow of a
doubt that it helps in a lot of different

1873
01:48:37,721 --> 01:48:39,130
areas.
It helps people with cancer,

1874
01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:42,760
helps people going through chemo
to get their appetite back.

1875
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:47,560
And that was people with glaucoma
by reducing interocular pressure,

1876
01:48:47,561 --> 01:48:51,640
it helps people with add the idea that
there's no medical benefits of it just

1877
01:48:51,641 --> 01:48:54,520
because it's not, I mean, and
then they make a pill for it.

1878
01:48:54,521 --> 01:48:58,580
They make fucking that THC pill
that they uh, I don't know.

1879
01:48:58,620 --> 01:48:59,560
Whatever the fuck it's called.

1880
01:48:59,561 --> 01:49:01,650
I didn't want to say it cause I
don't want anybody to buy it. Right.

1881
01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:05,770
Cause it's horse shit. You know,
they make like a synthetic THC pill,

1882
01:49:05,771 --> 01:49:10,600
which doesn't have nearly the
effects of just edible cannabis.

1883
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:13,180
That's something that we were talking
about before the show where it's like,

1884
01:49:13,630 --> 01:49:17,810
brownies, fuck you up. They don't
just fuck you up because bus,

1885
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,860
we'd fucks you up. They fuck
you up. Because when you eat it,

1886
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:25,720
he produces a completely
different chemical in your
body. You're, when marijuana,

1887
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:28,360
when THC is consumed in an edible form,

1888
01:49:28,361 --> 01:49:32,140
it produces something called
11 hydroxy metabolite, right?

1889
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:36,850
Which is like five times more
psychoactive than THC. Well, I believe it.

1890
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,970
Yeah. You know why that weird feeling
that you get when you eat a Brownie.

1891
01:49:40,390 --> 01:49:43,630
But I will never forget this man.
My friend Brent had a,

1892
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:46,700
Brett rather had a Holla, had, uh,

1893
01:49:46,810 --> 01:49:48,860
a company when he was trying to do,

1894
01:49:48,861 --> 01:49:50,830
when the medical marijuana
movement first started,

1895
01:49:50,860 --> 01:49:54,580
he had this company who's doing,
was making THC pills. Right?

1896
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:58,420
And I don't know what he did to fucking
get this stuff into a pill form,

1897
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:01,510
but he had, this is my strong
one and this is my medium one.

1898
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:04,900
Or if you're gonna take the medium
one, only take one. Right? Like, well,

1899
01:50:04,901 --> 01:50:07,060
why do you have a strong
one? He goes, I don't know.

1900
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:10,000
Eddie Bravo takes both of them.
He takes,

1901
01:50:10,030 --> 01:50:13,090
he takes at least if you took two strong,

1902
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:16,060
either took two strong ones or
two medium ones, whatever he did,

1903
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:21,061
I took one right and maybe an hour and a
half later I was the most uncomfortable

1904
01:50:22,091 --> 01:50:27,091
I have ever been in my entire life
where I was so terrified of everything.

1905
01:50:27,430 --> 01:50:31,630
The eye, well, I was looking at people
and they became two dimensional,

1906
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:35,650
but that was like seeing their souls like
peeking behind while they were talking

1907
01:50:35,651 --> 01:50:38,680
to me. I mean it became
like incredibly psychedelic,

1908
01:50:38,681 --> 01:50:43,681
like way more psychedelic than weed and
I didn't understand about the 11 hydroxy

1909
01:50:43,691 --> 01:50:44,560
metabolite thing then.

1910
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:49,780
But I talked to my friend Todd Mccormick
who just medical marijuana activist and

1911
01:50:50,351 --> 01:50:55,351
a professional natural deodorant user
at Brown and I'm a brilliant guy,

1912
01:50:57,070 --> 01:50:59,530
brilliant, brilliant guy. When it
comes to medical marijuana, he's,

1913
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:01,300
he actually did time.

1914
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:05,920
It was like one of the first guys to do
time for medical in California because

1915
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:09,430
they wouldn't let him use the term
medical marijuana even though he was

1916
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:12,840
operating under state law or when
they bring you to court. Right.

1917
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:14,790
Because it's a federal trial,
right?

1918
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,970
You don't even allow you to use the
term medical marijuana that term.

1919
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:23,020
You can't say it in court. What do you
say you'd go to jail. So what do you say?

1920
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:26,440
You got to say I grew marijuana and
sold it. Oh. And then they say, well,

1921
01:51:26,441 --> 01:51:29,470
you're a criminal. And then
he goes, uh, he said, well,

1922
01:51:29,471 --> 01:51:31,060
I was operating in the state lost shut up.

1923
01:51:31,150 --> 01:51:35,710
You can't bring up state law and a
federal court. It's an incredible, and he,

1924
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:39,730
and he, um, he wound up doing time,
but he's the perfect person. He's like,

1925
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:42,520
I can always call him. And He, you know,
he's a grower so I can call them up.

1926
01:51:42,521 --> 01:51:44,770
And I go, well, what does that and
why, why the fuck am I getting so high?

1927
01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:50,340
And it goes, oh, you got this, you got to
understand. Do you smoke weed everyday?

1928
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:53,400
No,
but I don't like to do anything every day.

1929
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,950
I don't think you should do anything
every day. But when you do do smoke,

1930
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:00,240
I don't smoke weed or any of that stuff.
Even eat every day.

1931
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:04,330
I like taking days off of eating
fast and stuff. Not even fast.

1932
01:52:04,331 --> 01:52:08,320
I just drink water and take a day off and
eating. I've done that before. You know,

1933
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:11,560
it's like the ID. Here's my
problem with fasting. My same,

1934
01:52:11,590 --> 01:52:13,560
the same problem I have with
healing. Right? You know,

1935
01:52:13,570 --> 01:52:16,150
like what are you talking about?
I'm a healer. Shut the fuck up.

1936
01:52:16,151 --> 01:52:20,860
You're not a healer. Stop. You might give
good massages or not a fucking healer.

1937
01:52:20,861 --> 01:52:23,890
You crazy bitch. I have
his new firm. I was,

1938
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:26,800
I just started getting rolfing done.
Know what rolfing done.

1939
01:52:26,801 --> 01:52:30,580
It's like super painful, deep
tissue massage. And I, uh,

1940
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:32,410
I read a bunch of different websites.

1941
01:52:32,411 --> 01:52:35,320
I was looking for someone that
does w Rolfing, the La area,

1942
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:38,050
and I read this one lady's
bio and it was like,

1943
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:42,610
I always knew from the moment I was a
child that I had natural healing and this

1944
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:47,540
is what I'm talking about,
Joe, all this shit that like
you, like, that's good shit,

1945
01:52:47,541 --> 01:52:51,680
but only attracts like weird NATO's.
Yeah. Well, because you know,

1946
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:55,070
there's a lot of fuckery in the world.
There's a lot of fuckery psychics.

1947
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:59,110
You at least jerk off everyday
though, right? Me Or you
take days off. I'm taking,

1948
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:02,330
I've taken many days off.
I never take it no more than 30 in a row,

1949
01:53:02,331 --> 01:53:03,860
but I'm a hard worker
when it comes to that.

1950
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,070
I did that once for a
website project. What, how,

1951
01:53:07,071 --> 01:53:10,760
how has the longest it took 30
days off. Well, it was ridiculous.

1952
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:13,550
We just like leaking everywhere.
I was getting bonus from hugs,

1953
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:18,980
hugs full on boner.
Boner hubs are pretty fantastic.

1954
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:23,680
It was amazing. I was like, wow.
Am when I first came to La, I uh,

1955
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:27,080
I had a girlfriend in
New York and uh, we, uh,

1956
01:53:27,470 --> 01:53:30,950
we were kind of like on the outs when I
first moved to La and I was figuring out

1957
01:53:30,951 --> 01:53:33,740
whether or not I should move her in with
me and bring her out here and whatever.

1958
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:38,960
And I was out here working on a TV show
for like two weeks and with by myself

1959
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:44,450
living in the Oak Woods apartment complex
and I was on the set and this girl,

1960
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,930
she said something the girl was working
with and we laughed and she said, Oh,

1961
01:53:47,931 --> 01:53:48,740
give me a hug,

1962
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:52,460
and she gave me this big giant hug and
you came in through her belly button. Nah,

1963
01:53:52,461 --> 01:53:56,480
man, I, I got her pregnant. I just,

1964
01:53:56,481 --> 01:54:00,590
the hug felt so good. I was like,
I got, I was like, I was at,

1965
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:04,360
I was on empty and I pulled into the
gas station and she filled me out. By

1966
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:09,330
then I realized like as a human
being at that point in my,

1967
01:54:09,331 --> 01:54:11,810
I was like in my twenties I was
still pretty fucking stupid,

1968
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:16,470
but I realize as a human
being that the human touch is,

1969
01:54:16,471 --> 01:54:19,490
it's not just a luxury that it's a staple.

1970
01:54:19,490 --> 01:54:23,180
It's a staple for a mental management and
then if you don't have someone in your

1971
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:26,330
life, you don't have loving
people in your life. It's not a,

1972
01:54:26,331 --> 01:54:29,750
it's not a I inconvenience.
Convenience. It's like it's unhealthy.

1973
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:34,430
It's bad for your body. It's, there's a,
there was a, there was something going on.

1974
01:54:34,431 --> 01:54:35,151
And again,
and what,

1975
01:54:35,151 --> 01:54:39,590
you can't measure it in the fucking
milligrams of vitamin C or Caffeine or

1976
01:54:39,591 --> 01:54:43,820
alcohol there, but there was a
reaction in my body that was very real.

1977
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:46,400
When that girl hugged me,
I felt so much better.

1978
01:54:46,700 --> 01:54:48,560
And I'll never forget that
because I'm like, okay,

1979
01:54:48,561 --> 01:54:50,510
well I have to realize
that this is a real,

1980
01:54:50,660 --> 01:54:55,660
this is something isn't one more thing
that we can't measure in conventional

1981
01:54:55,971 --> 01:55:00,260
terms, but that it actually
exists and it's tangible and
it's a fact. Well, I mean,

1982
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:03,860
I come from a family of huge
hookers, like, that's awesome.

1983
01:55:03,861 --> 01:55:06,350
I parents hug the shit out of me.
That's very unusual.

1984
01:55:07,010 --> 01:55:10,970
My Dad kisses me on my mouth. That's
beautiful. Uh, no tongue or tongue,

1985
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:14,660
sometimes a little bit of tone,
especially after whiskey breath. Right.

1986
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:19,320
And then in the time that I met Yoshi,
you know, have you ever tried like,

1987
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:23,960
you know, I hug all my friends. This is
the most awkward guy ever. He's like, Yo,

1988
01:55:23,970 --> 01:55:25,130
shell the title.
But he's like,

1989
01:55:29,610 --> 01:55:34,200
alright,
alright.

1990
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:45,180
Jesus, that lazy gentleman was
a gas moment in our podcast.

1991
01:55:45,181 --> 01:55:47,710
Just came in his pants and
we've had gay be blond.

1992
01:55:48,240 --> 01:55:51,180
We had gay people on confirmed. You
know what? I don't think we have.

1993
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:56,610
You make so much more sense then we
need to get a a gay representation. Oh,

1994
01:55:56,611 --> 01:55:59,940
by the way, we're going to have Melissa
Etheridge on the podcast. Whoa. Yeah.

1995
01:55:59,941 --> 01:56:04,120
Melissa Ashridge actually asked to be
on the podcast. Publicists content out.

1996
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:07,700
I hope she doesn't yell at me for
my cartoonish portrayal of lesbian.

1997
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:11,310
That's fine. This isn't punishment.
I hope she actually likes it.

1998
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:15,540
I like it as beans. She might not be.
This might not be a friendly visit.

1999
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:21,950
I'm just kidding, but we need more gay
representation on this podcast. She's gay.

2000
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,900
She's a lesbian.
It's different.

2001
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:31,420
I always trip on the word gay. Anyway,
look at all uncomfortable. It looks good.

2002
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,960
It looks like you just check
to see if he has a boner.

2003
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:38,460
You guys chose Yo. She's good
man. No, he's a great guy.

2004
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:41,400
He's just very awkward with human
[inaudible]. She had an awkward awkward,

2005
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:44,220
just not me, but that's not
a very common thing in Japan.

2006
01:56:44,221 --> 01:56:48,090
You don't talk about Asians
don't have your, your reality,

2007
01:56:48,140 --> 01:56:51,040
your situation like your family,
like you don't want to talk about though.

2008
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:51,460
I talked to him.

2009
01:56:51,460 --> 01:56:55,020
Everything you tell everybody in the
whole story what you did and why you can't

2010
01:56:55,021 --> 01:56:57,780
go back to Japan. No, I could
go back. I just can't get out.

2011
01:56:58,110 --> 01:57:00,960
You can't get out once you go back.
I would imagine so.

2012
01:57:00,961 --> 01:57:04,870
There's probably why that there's
probably like a criminal record tell.

2013
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:09,310
It's a little different because tell
everybody what happened if you want it to

2014
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:12,450
you. I mean this is an interesting
story. The best story ever. Well,

2015
01:57:13,410 --> 01:57:16,950
if you want to listen, not
a problem at all. Okay.

2016
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:19,920
That's the only reason why I brought
this up is because I know you're pretty

2017
01:57:20,430 --> 01:57:22,590
adamant about expressing
yourself all the time.

2018
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,300
I will say before I finished, I
started the story that uh, Dave,

2019
01:57:27,301 --> 01:57:32,301
what's the rest are in Japan September
of 2003 in the same week I was in jail in

2020
01:57:33,461 --> 01:57:35,590
La County. So I guess we were
meant to meet each other,

2021
01:57:35,591 --> 01:57:39,160
but they are part of 10 years ago. Set
this coming September, we're in jail. Oh,

2022
01:57:39,161 --> 01:57:39,880
someone sounds like

2023
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:40,713
stalker.

2024
01:57:40,810 --> 01:57:45,370
That's exactly what I would send an email
if I was trying to get them to get me

2025
01:57:45,371 --> 01:57:50,140
pregnant. So what's
your, tell us your story.

2026
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:54,770
So I got an email in August,
2003 from my cousin.

2027
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:58,520
Basically my writing skill
in Japanese isn't that good.

2028
01:57:58,521 --> 01:58:03,150
So he wrote it in English. He basically
could roll pop up dead. That's a nice one.

2029
01:58:03,151 --> 01:58:06,080
Dead. My father was dead, but they
didn't know how to write in English.

2030
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:07,820
So that's the only thing they will.

2031
01:58:07,880 --> 01:58:11,750
And I called them and find out
my dad supposedly killed himself.

2032
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:15,530
So wedding couple of days I flew back
to Japan and find out what happened

2033
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:19,550
because I saw him six months
before, early 2003. Um,

2034
01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:22,670
I find out that my step mother was
cheating on my dad before marriage,

2035
01:58:22,671 --> 01:58:25,850
during marriage. And they're trying to,
they're in process getting divorced,

2036
01:58:25,851 --> 01:58:29,390
but my dad killed himself later one.
We don't know for sure.

2037
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:34,100
He commit suicide or my step have
something to do with his death.

2038
01:58:34,130 --> 01:58:37,670
We don't know. But, um, during the
funeral I still, my step mother killed.

2039
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:41,860
You think she killed? I think so. Why do
you think that? The more I hear the story,

2040
01:58:41,861 --> 01:58:45,820
she sounds like the most, like my
cousins, older brother in Korea,

2041
01:58:45,821 --> 01:58:48,970
she was living in Korea. My
stepmother, so my cousins,

2042
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:52,900
older brother lives in Korea,
their version FBI,

2043
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:58,350
they checked the background and my
stepmother flew in the day before.

2044
01:58:59,110 --> 01:59:02,800
The last time they saw my dad alive.
Doesn't mean that he killed her,

2045
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:04,880
but that she lied. She killed him. Yeah.

2046
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:08,680
She said that she was in Japan the whole
time and we find out later why she lied.

2047
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:11,400
She lied about that. Well, she
lied about that. That's that,

2048
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:15,590
that kind of guilt lying about where
you were very suspicious. Yeah.

2049
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:19,750
So it doesn't mean she did it
die. How did he die? Um, hanging.

2050
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,670
So I went to police station,
saw the picture,

2051
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:27,010
and he was in the hot sun for
like two weeks. So he was dark.

2052
01:59:27,011 --> 01:59:31,690
I mean, he looked like he was hanging
outside, inside, but that summertime,

2053
01:59:31,691 --> 01:59:35,200
Japan is so hot and humid,
a decomposing. This is,

2054
01:59:35,201 --> 01:59:37,630
this is how I met Yoshi told us.
What was the joke?

2055
01:59:37,660 --> 01:59:40,990
It was the darkest joke I've ever
heard in my life. What did I say?

2056
01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:47,130
Hi. I'm a little high. You're a little
[inaudible] told the joke. It's so fun.

2057
01:59:47,320 --> 01:59:50,860
It's not a joke. I just say, you know,
he was darker than a nigger or whatever,

2058
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,870
but oh yo,

2059
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:56,030
that is not a dark joke
or even a good one.

2060
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:00,110
But the racial slurs darker
than Bobby Lee's balls. Yes.

2061
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:04,470
So Bobby Lehan dark balls,
black balls. The, I can't have,

2062
02:00:04,630 --> 02:00:08,740
I can't approve that. That joke. Do you
don't say that on stage do. Yeah, he did.

2063
02:00:08,741 --> 02:00:11,710
He did. I was like, this guy's
crazy. He's like, that's ridiculous.

2064
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:13,170
That's how you ended
your act or something.

2065
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:16,560
That's a good way to get your
ass kicked. Not yet. But um,

2066
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,240
but basically he had been
hanging and he turned black,

2067
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:24,440
so he was hanging and basically the heat
of the house just kind of slowly cooked

2068
02:00:25,961 --> 02:00:28,420
him. Yeah. I mean, I saw the
picture, the cop told me,

2069
02:00:28,510 --> 02:00:32,470
I highly recommend you don't look at the
picture, but I needed to see, you know,

2070
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:35,050
because after his death,
my family farm,

2071
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:37,130
he told me that all the horrible
things that we were have.

2072
02:00:37,131 --> 02:00:40,710
So do you think that she could have
possibly driven him to do that?

2073
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:45,340
That for sure. 100% yeah. Yeah. She
lived hundreds of thousands of dead.

2074
02:00:46,090 --> 02:00:50,740
And He, she told my dad that she
brought one of her cousin from Korea.

2075
02:00:50,950 --> 02:00:54,970
We laid on find out it was her, her the
whole time. So while my dad was working,

2076
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:58,180
she was fucking this guy pretending
to be her cousin, whatever.

2077
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:02,260
Just the whole humiliation debt and all
this stuff. And like, was she younger?

2078
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:06,280
10 years younger, but this, are you
sure she wasn't just fucking her cousin.

2079
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:09,700
This is why a guy like David
should be afraid of marriage. Okay.

2080
02:01:10,330 --> 02:01:11,620
Never ever,

2081
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:17,010
never fuck someone where you're confused
as to why they're fucking you or never.

2082
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:21,690
But then
the reality is,

2083
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:24,280
and the natural law world,
you shouldn't get laid. Brian,

2084
02:01:24,890 --> 02:01:27,730
you should get your shit
together first. But so, so,

2085
02:01:27,731 --> 02:01:31,840
so that happens when you do that man,
people start to resent.

2086
02:01:31,841 --> 02:01:35,710
You ever see like a famous dude with a
trophy wife and the trophy wife fucking

2087
02:01:35,711 --> 02:01:40,340
hates being there, you know? And you see
that, that that's uh, that's a sketchy

2088
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,310
situation.
Yeah.

2089
02:01:41,650 --> 02:01:46,650
I watched this dude and a watched his
wife yelled at him and shit and he's like,

2090
02:01:47,811 --> 02:01:50,510
uh,
like this sort of minuscule famous guy.

2091
02:01:50,660 --> 02:01:53,330
He's a small guy and the
wife was yelling at him,

2092
02:01:53,331 --> 02:01:54,470
giving him a hard time and he had just,

2093
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:57,380
he just absorbed it and dealt
with it and it was really,

2094
02:01:57,410 --> 02:02:01,550
it really fucked me up cause this guy's
really famous and I was doing, man,

2095
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:03,440
why are you in this prison abuse you,

2096
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:08,480
this is fucking shitty person in
your life is treating you like that.

2097
02:02:08,481 --> 02:02:11,180
Why? Because she's not impressed
with you. Like what is it?

2098
02:02:12,050 --> 02:02:15,380
I'll tell you why some people wait a
hundred and fucking 30 pounds and she was

2099
02:02:15,381 --> 02:02:19,370
six foot tall and hot as fuck and she
really wanted to get fucked by giant black

2100
02:02:19,450 --> 02:02:20,283
guy.

2101
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:24,900
Mandingo giant Mandingo or
cause and maybe like when a guy,

2102
02:02:26,610 --> 02:02:29,960
when the guy is an old guy and he's got
this hot young chippy and there was no

2103
02:02:29,961 --> 02:02:33,870
washes with them. Yeah. She's
fucking stealing from you man. Yeah.

2104
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:37,033
So what happened?

2105
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:41,650
So I went back to the funeral and um,
somehow she was,

2106
02:02:41,860 --> 02:02:45,160
she didn't know my temperament because
my dad's a very kind and nice person.

2107
02:02:45,370 --> 02:02:49,320
He's never hit me before, but
I have temperament from my
mother. She was, you know,

2108
02:02:49,390 --> 02:02:52,780
she was typical Korean women
varies, uh, aggressive, you know.

2109
02:02:52,781 --> 02:02:56,530
So I caught her at the funeral by herself,
uh,

2110
02:02:56,560 --> 02:02:59,920
preparing to funeral thing for my dad.
Right. It was like way up a hill. Yeah.

2111
02:03:00,010 --> 02:03:02,710
Way Up in the hill, rest of the family
of down the hill and parking lot.

2112
02:03:02,711 --> 02:03:03,620
They didn't know what's going on.

2113
02:03:03,640 --> 02:03:07,930
So basically I went up there with my
aunt and my aunt's soul, my stepmother,

2114
02:03:07,931 --> 02:03:10,720
and she goes, you kill my fucking
brother. You fucking bitch. He leaves.

2115
02:03:10,990 --> 02:03:15,100
It was me and her and everyone knows at
this point that she was cheating on him

2116
02:03:15,101 --> 02:03:16,910
the whole time. Oh yeah. Everybody
knows that. She though this all.

2117
02:03:16,930 --> 02:03:20,860
She even tried to poison my dad. So next
thing you know, she tried to poison.

2118
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:24,250
They took the sample way
in all those Korean dish,

2119
02:03:24,251 --> 02:03:25,900
Kimchi or whatever she brought from Korea.

2120
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:29,410
My Dad kept getting sick so they took
all the food from refrigerator at some

2121
02:03:29,411 --> 02:03:30,040
medical lab.

2122
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:35,040
They check and there was a poison in a
dish when your stomach is poisoning his

2123
02:03:36,461 --> 02:03:41,320
Kimchi and hitting on and cheating on him
and the whole family knows and she has

2124
02:03:41,321 --> 02:03:44,800
the fucking balls to go to the funeral.
When she was playing this thing,

2125
02:03:44,801 --> 02:03:47,970
she didn't know anything about me and
her older sister has a reputation of

2126
02:03:48,290 --> 02:03:51,200
Marion, bunch of guy and they all
tie in a mysterious circumstances,

2127
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:54,070
have a history.
They have a history of that.

2128
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:57,010
Her older sister does this fucking thing.

2129
02:03:57,390 --> 02:04:01,210
This sounds like it's crazy. It's
fucking insane. So my aunts are,

2130
02:04:01,211 --> 02:04:02,470
you fucking beg you kill my brother.

2131
02:04:02,471 --> 02:04:06,670
She left and then 10 seconds later I just
started running over and just beating

2132
02:04:06,671 --> 02:04:10,930
the shit out of her and I grabbed back
of her head and start punching their face

2133
02:04:10,931 --> 02:04:14,230
for a long time and put her
in. She's unconscious. No,

2134
02:04:14,231 --> 02:04:17,230
but she was shocked because she didn't
know I had an inmate to do that and I was

2135
02:04:17,231 --> 02:04:19,600
a little surprised because I didn't
plan to do that. I was angry,

2136
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:22,750
but I didn't take, she was dumb enough to
be separated by the rest of her family,

2137
02:04:22,751 --> 02:04:25,540
but she was arrest. Gosh, who? She
was by herself. You are by herself.

2138
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:27,490
No one's anywhere near that.
No one near.

2139
02:04:27,491 --> 02:04:30,820
And instead of grabbing her back of her
head and just started beating her face

2140
02:04:30,821 --> 02:04:32,600
in stop and uh,

2141
02:04:32,650 --> 02:04:37,090
put on her ground and it's not stumping
be turning or legs, eyeball was dumped.

2142
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:41,040
Her Pussy. Yeah, stomach and her face,

2143
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:42,390
her eyeball is about to come out.

2144
02:04:42,630 --> 02:04:44,830
I was stamping her face like
I have to five or six times.

2145
02:04:44,860 --> 02:04:47,070
I heard some lady that work
at the cemetery scream,

2146
02:04:47,071 --> 02:04:50,700
that's when I kinda just stomping
on this lady and started screaming.

2147
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:54,390
So how much damage did you do to her?
I think if I did it,

2148
02:04:54,510 --> 02:04:57,750
like my cousin called me and like
week later and he was actually,

2149
02:04:57,751 --> 02:05:00,120
he was laughing on the phone like,
yeah, if you did it for another menu,

2150
02:05:00,121 --> 02:05:01,290
probably killed her,
whatever.

2151
02:05:01,291 --> 02:05:04,350
She ended up going to hospital for
like two and a half, three months,

2152
02:05:05,190 --> 02:05:07,350
but that's snapped him out of it.
The lady screaming.

2153
02:05:07,500 --> 02:05:10,230
So then he ran back down the
hill. That's true. And then like,

2154
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,660
like everyone's like
what the fuck's going on?

2155
02:05:12,661 --> 02:05:16,140
And he like grabbed his cousin's
car keys. No, no, no. Yes.

2156
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:18,260
I went down and uh,

2157
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:22,360
my stepmother's nephew was walking up the
stairs. He didn't know what's going on.

2158
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,560
So I started coming down and he
doesn't know what's going on.

2159
02:05:24,561 --> 02:05:26,970
And so I figured by then
I already beat one person.

2160
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:30,780
What difference does it make if I, so
his guy goes, people, this funeral was,

2161
02:05:30,781 --> 02:05:32,190
how long after Japan?

2162
02:05:32,770 --> 02:05:36,150
Why like when you got off the plane and
went straight to the funeral, right?

2163
02:05:36,450 --> 02:05:38,940
A day after? Yeah. So
this guy gets the Japan,

2164
02:05:39,330 --> 02:05:42,630
goes to a funeral and then just
starts punching people and then like,

2165
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:45,390
so you attacked him as well?
For what reason?

2166
02:05:45,391 --> 02:05:48,290
Just because I feel related to her,

2167
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:51,780
related to her and like what difference
does it make if I think everybody at

2168
02:05:51,781 --> 02:05:54,350
this point? Yeah. It's like
porn stars. Like what difference
does it make you feel?

2169
02:05:54,351 --> 02:05:56,820
What?
Fuck one hooker or 500 at once you do one.

2170
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:01,740
It's really interesting that you're using
attempted murder and connecting it to

2171
02:06:01,741 --> 02:06:05,460
gang bang. Oh, Yoshi kills
hookers all the time now

2172
02:06:07,110 --> 02:06:08,180
and kills him with his aides.

2173
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:13,940
So the animal ate at a boy.

2174
02:06:15,610 --> 02:06:18,270
So I went down the stairs, I
saw him, I sucker punch him.

2175
02:06:18,271 --> 02:06:21,180
He doesn't know what's going on. Oh
my God. And there was a little, uh,

2176
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:25,350
you feel bad for that? No, not at all.
But he, I wish I want to do with it.

2177
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:29,430
I know I was just angry with her
and her family. Right. But I mean,

2178
02:06:29,460 --> 02:06:32,030
her family is just people.
Yeah. You know, I mean,

2179
02:06:32,031 --> 02:06:35,580
you don't feel bad fat of poisoning
poisonous Pete. Well, you know,

2180
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:39,270
I mean maybe they don't know what the
fuck the sister and her dad at the time.

2181
02:06:39,271 --> 02:06:40,500
I didn't,
I wasn't really rationale.

2182
02:06:40,501 --> 02:06:44,340
It was just so I sucker punching.

2183
02:06:44,341 --> 02:06:46,980
He went down and most of these eight,
I'm six foot one.

2184
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:48,930
Most of these people are
like five one five, two.

2185
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:52,980
So even though I'm not a
physically imposing in America,
I'm pretty big in Japan.

2186
02:06:52,980 --> 02:06:54,900
You're kicking ass in jail.
Um,

2187
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:57,360
Anderson Silva when it comes to
fighting and beating up old women,

2188
02:06:57,390 --> 02:07:02,010
but so how old was she when you
did this to her? 55 or something.

2189
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:08,280
Oh, Holy Shit. She killed his dad,
man. Oh, I understand. Listen,

2190
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:11,820
there's no [inaudible] I lost my fucking
mind. Listen, I would have killed her. I,

2191
02:07:11,870 --> 02:07:14,640
if I, if I'm stomping on a check
for five times, she's dead.

2192
02:07:15,750 --> 02:07:18,330
I don't know how the fuck your
pussy stomps allowed her to live.

2193
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:20,250
So he knocks the,
knocks the nephew out.

2194
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:22,950
I got this little is not something
to joke about, by the way,

2195
02:07:22,951 --> 02:07:26,250
ladies and gentlemen. You're
right. If your outrage
listening to this, you're like,

2196
02:07:26,251 --> 02:07:31,251
I can't believe he just got that little
mallet where Buddhist scope to water to

2197
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:33,870
clean that cemetery. I grabbed
that stuff, just beat him one.

2198
02:07:33,871 --> 02:07:37,540
But they had a couple of times ran
down the parking lot and it's so the my

2199
02:07:37,541 --> 02:07:41,920
stepmother's older sister and her and
her husband and then I started s sucker

2200
02:07:41,921 --> 02:07:46,660
punch him too. It's punching everybody.
Yeah. Punchbowl endurance at this point.

2201
02:07:46,980 --> 02:07:50,480
You're getting winded. Yeah. I wish I
would have stretched before that fight,

2202
02:07:51,210 --> 02:07:53,270
but I didn't plan,
it wasn't planning itself.

2203
02:07:55,020 --> 02:07:57,400
I don't know anything by my short,
I don't know any of that stuff.

2204
02:07:58,130 --> 02:07:59,920
It was unplanned was
beat all these people.

2205
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:04,630
But how do you get out of the country?
Uh, like Syria. My Shit, Mike,

2206
02:08:04,690 --> 02:08:09,160
my aunt Yoshi, she's the only one
when he started finding me back,

2207
02:08:09,161 --> 02:08:13,000
she's the one, she had a cancer brain
cancer actually, but she's the one that,

2208
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:16,810
you know, uh, interrupt a fight, sub
punching him and just told me to leave.

2209
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:20,800
And I told my cousin dragged me out of
there and he wasn't sure cause he went to,

2210
02:08:20,830 --> 02:08:22,660
so you punched them too? No, no, no, no.

2211
02:08:23,680 --> 02:08:27,190
If I think he hesitated because he doesn't
want to a somebody who did criminal

2212
02:08:27,191 --> 02:08:29,110
acts,
but he's smaller than I am.

2213
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:30,610
So if you don't think I'm going
to beat the shit out of it.

2214
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:32,050
Well we got in his car,

2215
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:36,100
he's dry me out of there and I
went to all second international.

2216
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:38,890
He just got to Japan.
Yeah, like a day before.

2217
02:08:38,891 --> 02:08:40,870
And then he went and beat
everyone up and then he's hiding.

2218
02:08:40,871 --> 02:08:44,590
You got right to the airport? I grabbed
his cell phone and call the airlines,

2219
02:08:44,620 --> 02:08:45,453
changed my flight.

2220
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:49,090
I'm praying there's another flight within
four hours and there just happened to

2221
02:08:49,091 --> 02:08:51,010
be one in four hours.
So I went over there.

2222
02:08:51,011 --> 02:08:54,460
But that was the longest full hours
airport because I figure she'll call the

2223
02:08:54,461 --> 02:08:57,640
police what happened had
they not call the police.

2224
02:08:58,450 --> 02:09:01,480
It never even occurred to them because
they were so worried about her.

2225
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:03,790
They went to hospital, whether it
probably didn't know where you went.

2226
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,850
They figured out. They figured out was
hiding somebody, one of my cousin's house.

2227
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:11,380
Do you think that they knew that she was
guilty too, or everybody knows? She said,

2228
02:09:12,190 --> 02:09:14,940
how did you find out it was your
aunt that told you, right? Yeah.

2229
02:09:15,040 --> 02:09:18,370
It was her trying to poison
him. Huh? Yeah. Your aunt
told you, what did she say?

2230
02:09:18,730 --> 02:09:21,440
They have a medical record
in this whole time. Yeah,

2231
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:23,740
but it doesn't mean she tried to kill him.
Oh No.

2232
02:09:23,741 --> 02:09:26,440
She tried to kill him because
of the poisoning though.
That's pretty definitive.

2233
02:09:26,470 --> 02:09:29,930
Yeah. And they had a medical lab. Uh, I
don't know how they figured out poisoned,

2234
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:32,350
but they took it to lab. Ever
Eat Kimchi at Yoshi, his house,

2235
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:38,140
he keeps his daddy's Kimchi in general
is pretty strong and I love Kimchi,

2236
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:41,240
Kimchi at Yoshi cells and it tastes
a little weird. Don't eat that shit.

2237
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:45,400
Damn Dude. So you escaped Japan? Yeah.

2238
02:09:45,460 --> 02:09:49,150
And the other criminal charges pressed
against you. Here's a weird thing.

2239
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:54,010
Mostly comps in Japan doing or be a part
of like family dispute with technical.

2240
02:09:54,011 --> 02:09:57,610
She's still my family. So whenever
there's a family at each birthday, rather,

2241
02:09:57,640 --> 02:10:02,050
there's even a fucking head
stomping. Well, generally speaking,

2242
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:06,190
but, um, I don't want to go back to
Japan to find out. So remember you,

2243
02:10:06,191 --> 02:10:09,670
and I think Jody's, it does ask me and
like the goal, but you're in translate.

2244
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:13,990
I would love to do it, but I was
little war. Maybe soon as I land,

2245
02:10:14,110 --> 02:10:18,220
there's a wrecker of it and put me in
jail. They could be right. There might be,

2246
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:22,240
but most likely I can't get out.
Dave cannot get in.

2247
02:10:22,300 --> 02:10:25,300
Those are two different things.
Can you not get in? I went to jail.

2248
02:10:25,301 --> 02:10:26,710
There are a few years ago.
What'd you go to jail,

2249
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:31,420
therefore I beat up a undercover
security guard. What happened? Well,

2250
02:10:31,421 --> 02:10:34,190
it's sort of, it's sort of
like Yoshi said, I'm not a huge

2251
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:35,330
guy over here,
but over there,

2252
02:10:35,331 --> 02:10:39,860
like I'm sort of the Anderson
Silva of what happened over there.

2253
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:41,770
Uh, you know, it's,

2254
02:10:42,290 --> 02:10:44,950
I could talk about this for like
hours and hours, but basically I,

2255
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:50,600
I in much of the same way
where I helped, uh, you know,

2256
02:10:50,601 --> 02:10:52,130
the old people dinner
during the earthquake,

2257
02:10:52,131 --> 02:10:56,090
turn their gas off and then went
looting, like have a, you know,

2258
02:10:56,091 --> 02:11:00,430
I had a troubled past
where, you know, beef,

2259
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:02,870
this is before I got like
seriously into gambling.

2260
02:11:02,900 --> 02:11:04,760
Like I spent most of
my childhood just like,

2261
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:08,570
just like fighting and getting into all
kinds of trouble and doing like small

2262
02:11:08,571 --> 02:11:10,820
time criminal kind of
activities and stuff.

2263
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,440
And so when I went to Japan where it
was like the society based on like honor

2264
02:11:15,441 --> 02:11:18,680
and like, you know, the light turns
red and then everyone stops walking.

2265
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:21,080
And I was like, Whoa,
this is fucking crazy.

2266
02:11:21,230 --> 02:11:25,520
Like they like don't even have locks on
their bicycles because who would steal a

2267
02:11:25,521 --> 02:11:28,400
bike that's not your property?
Like it's crazy.

2268
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:32,000
Like you could literally go to Japan
and just get on someone's biking. Just,

2269
02:11:32,030 --> 02:11:35,240
I was like, this is fucking nuts. So
that's what I did. I'd go to Japan,

2270
02:11:35,241 --> 02:11:37,850
I'd steal some guy's bike
and I'd go out all night,

2271
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:40,490
spray painting graffiti
on everything cause like,

2272
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:43,820
and I would just do it in broad daylight,
like no one would stop me, you know?

2273
02:11:44,030 --> 02:11:47,690
And then at the end of the day I just go
bring the bike back. And so, you know,

2274
02:11:47,691 --> 02:11:50,780
my art was getting a lot of
recognition out there at the time.

2275
02:11:50,781 --> 02:11:53,180
So I was going out there like once a year,
twice a year,

2276
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:56,920
no stealing bikes, stealing bikes through
graffiti, stealing shit. Like just,

2277
02:11:56,980 --> 02:12:01,310
just causing, you know, damage
and chaos in general. Right.

2278
02:12:02,120 --> 02:12:04,370
So, yeah, I mean

2279
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:07,270
is, that's one thing when
we were in Japan, uh, some,

2280
02:12:07,290 --> 02:12:09,950
some guide was telling me about
like the same kind of thing.

2281
02:12:09,951 --> 02:12:11,870
Like you could tell these girls anything,

2282
02:12:11,871 --> 02:12:13,640
they'll believe you
cause more lies to them.

2283
02:12:13,641 --> 02:12:17,390
So like you can tell him like that you're
super famous rock stars and it kind of

2284
02:12:17,391 --> 02:12:19,230
felt bad about it, you know, like you felt

2285
02:12:19,350 --> 02:12:24,190
after Brian's fifth stories,
I'm not really iron man.

2286
02:12:28,290 --> 02:12:30,980
Wow. So you got arrested
for doing well? Yeah, I mean

2287
02:12:31,460 --> 02:12:34,250
definitely deserved. I mean it was the
best thing that could happened to me.

2288
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:38,120
My life in general was getting out of
control and going to jail was probably the

2289
02:12:38,121 --> 02:12:38,620
best thing.

2290
02:12:38,620 --> 02:12:42,850
Dude, you, you guys both in
fucking awesome. Thank you
very much for doing this.

2291
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:45,790
Thank you for coming down this.
I would love to do yours as well.

2292
02:12:46,570 --> 02:12:49,620
Let's go back and forth, back and forth
to what? A bunch of different off.

2293
02:12:49,621 --> 02:12:53,350
Love to have your Yoshi. Keep it together.
Okay. I think you're going to be fine.

2294
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:56,110
There's a lot of people are gonna Stare
at you Wednesday night, the Ice House,

2295
02:12:56,111 --> 02:12:58,510
knowing that you almost
stumped a lady to death,

2296
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:00,850
so it's going to be a
little bit deserved it man.

2297
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:02,410
It's going to be an interesting
show Wednesday night.

2298
02:13:02,710 --> 02:13:04,120
Anyone who is coming out Wednesday night,

2299

guy hawk. He needs a human touch.

2300
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:13,090
Murder is murder. If you saw his
face after that group hug right now,

2301
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:17,140
it was very uncomfortable. He didn't
know how to accept that kind of love.

2302
02:13:17,170 --> 02:13:21,490
He's our drip guy. You're a great guy.
He's a good guy. He's a great guy.

2303
02:13:21,491 --> 02:13:22,690
He just needs a lot more hugs.

2304
02:13:22,710 --> 02:13:25,450

2306

2310
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:43,140
d a s a dotcom. Oh my. I don't know

2311
02:13:43,141 --> 02:13:47,910
so just go to there to
check it out on iTunes. A Lt

2312
02:13:47,980 --> 02:13:51,580
probably. You can get away. You can
do it. Yeah, especially the audio.

2313
02:13:51,581 --> 02:13:54,910
They'll allow anything.
It's essentially the imagination.

2314
02:13:54,911 --> 02:13:56,360
You're just talking about things.
You're not sure.

2315
02:13:56,380 --> 02:13:59,890
You can't show pornographic
images and a video iPod thing.

2316
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:04,450
Easily hybrid of all of Yo, she's
bought wholesale. It's, yeah, no,

2317
02:14:04,510 --> 02:14:08,440
don't show yo she's home because
it's just too tempting. Again,

2318
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:10,890
like his gay porn or
it's training and stuff.

2319
02:14:10,930 --> 02:14:13,530
It might drag you over to the dark side.
Yo,

2320
02:14:13,750 --> 02:14:16,360
she would tempt you with
this black hole of butthole.

2321
02:14:16,510 --> 02:14:19,090
Well, you guys are filming. You guys
are filming this whole show, right?

2322
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:23,360
On our podcast we have one camera and
it's just pointed at Oscars. Pussy.

2323
02:14:24,160 --> 02:14:28,960
That's hilarious. It's like you want to
see how did you, how did you meet her?

2324
02:14:28,961 --> 02:14:33,460
How did you guys become friends? This
guy, he just became my buddy. Well it's,

2325
02:14:33,461 --> 02:14:37,270
it's like the thing you were saying about
the cock hold and like watching black

2326
02:14:37,271 --> 02:14:40,000
guys,
like I've talked about this before,

2327
02:14:40,001 --> 02:14:42,850
but basically if you're
a guy and your Asian,

2328
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,170
the only place you are in American
porn is, is gay and the bottom,

2329
02:14:47,530 --> 02:14:50,680
there's not one Asian male
porn star in straight porn.

2330
02:14:51,120 --> 02:14:54,430
So just the one now except for one now,
which was that movie.

2331
02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:58,510
So after I got to know Yoshi and you know,
knowing what a degenerate he is,

2332
02:14:58,750 --> 02:14:59,710
he's like,
hey Dave,

2333
02:14:59,740 --> 02:15:04,740
they're filming the first Asian American
porn where the whole cast is Asian.

2334
02:15:04,990 --> 02:15:08,630
And I was like, Whoa, that's pretty like
groundbreaking, you know, there's no like,

2335
02:15:09,130 --> 02:15:13,150
like it's gay to know what I
guess when you jerk off to porn,

2336
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:17,300
like I've watched so much porn, I could
recognize the guy's penis now about that.

2337
02:15:17,720 --> 02:15:22,370
Yeah. That's pretty North Homo. Exactly.
Exactly. And you know, you seen,

2338
02:15:22,570 --> 02:15:25,380
there's not that many guys, so you
start to recognize the guys. Yeah.

2339
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:29,750
So can you name a Asian male porn
star? Yeah, there isn't any. Right.

2340
02:15:29,980 --> 02:15:34,750
So Yoshi told me about it and
then we went, yeah, we went,

2341
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:37,960
I went to the set of the,
the first and it was,

2342
02:15:38,230 --> 02:15:41,320
it was based on a weird
Japanese poet or someone,

2343
02:15:41,321 --> 02:15:44,650
some chick that like cuts off her lover's
penis or something. It was very hard.

2344
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:48,400
Yeah. Fist to the nuts star
and also was the star in that.

2345
02:15:48,401 --> 02:15:53,110
So we hit it off right away. And uh,
yeah, that's how I met also through Yoshi.

2346
02:15:53,290 --> 02:15:57,550
And that was like the first time that
was the first, like she just got married.

2347
02:15:57,580 --> 02:16:00,970
Yeah. She just got
married. Dude, trust me.

2348
02:16:00,971 --> 02:16:05,620
That's all I kind of a deal is that well,
it's to another porn star. Yeah. So,

2349
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:09,070
uh, okay. But, uh, you know, she was the,

2350
02:16:09,250 --> 02:16:12,970
she was one of the first like women
that I met that I was like genuinely

2351
02:16:12,971 --> 02:16:16,690
interested in after my seven
year long relationship.

2352
02:16:17,110 --> 02:16:20,980
So I met her on that set.
And then I'm like,

2353
02:16:20,981 --> 02:16:22,180
this chick is fucking Rad.

2354
02:16:22,181 --> 02:16:25,330
Like she'll just like talk about anything
and how she has to like wash your

2355
02:16:25,331 --> 02:16:29,920
butthole out and it's just like not
in a gross way and it's very to meet

2356
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:33,700
someone that's like so open and honest
about everything. She's very funny too.

2357
02:16:34,010 --> 02:16:35,690
Synchronicity and the,
the,

2358
02:16:35,691 --> 02:16:39,680
the word DVD asa when you're
doing a show with asa. Akira.

2359
02:16:40,110 --> 02:16:44,340
Yeah. Well, I mean it sounds like David
and asa phonetically, phonetically,

2360
02:16:44,790 --> 02:16:47,320
but it's actual double,
double,

2361
02:16:48,330 --> 02:16:51,570
double anal census sensitive artists.

2362
02:16:52,470 --> 02:16:55,740
So that's the website. Let me Ladies
and gentlemen, double vaginal,

2363
02:16:55,770 --> 02:16:59,640
double anal sensitive artist. If
you can't find it, go fuck yourself.

2364
02:16:59,660 --> 02:17:01,980
It's a great podcast.
We don't want you to find it.

2365
02:17:02,040 --> 02:17:04,650
It's one of the very few podcasts that
I actually listened to. I love it. Oh,

2366
02:17:04,651 --> 02:17:06,860
thanks for podcasts.

2367
02:17:07,240 --> 02:17:11,200
Made me hate a lot of people that I
used to not find it annoying. All right,

2368
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:13,790
I'll fucking listen to their podcast
and I want to fucking throw him off a

2369
02:17:13,791 --> 02:17:14,624
mountain.

2370
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:19,030
The story of how you first met, um,
Yoshi is one of my favorite stories.

2371
02:17:19,031 --> 02:17:22,480
I think it was on the first
episode of DVD Essay and just your,

2372
02:17:22,481 --> 02:17:24,960
your how you do his
voice isn't first nation,

2373
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,300
so it makes the story so much better.
So we're going to bring you out of this,

2374
02:17:28,710 --> 02:17:33,710
but prepare for a fucking avalanche of
a hate mail from people don't like dude

2375
02:17:33,911 --> 02:17:36,060
stomp and women a death, especially
when they're in their 50 [inaudible].

2376
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:39,430
Honestly, if anyone out there
wants to sit here and judge Yoshi,

2377
02:17:39,910 --> 02:17:44,560
think about if there was a person out
there that like did your family wrong and

2378
02:17:44,561 --> 02:17:47,350
what you would do to them,
especially kill your dad. Yeah.

2379
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:51,370
I mean you don't know if she did, but at
the very least she tried the very least.

2380
02:17:51,371 --> 02:17:53,500
She tried to poison.
But then here's the flip side of that.

2381
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:58,440
Are You mad at your dad for like
allowing a woman like that? The power,

2382
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:02,860
I was really angry with him. Do you
think like, yeah, I mean he goes, well,

2383
02:18:02,861 --> 02:18:03,694
you're doing

2384
02:18:03,740 --> 02:18:08,300
by partnering up with slots is an
excellent move because much like getting

2385
02:18:08,301 --> 02:18:13,301
inoculation shots or protects you from
other sluts being so mystical did they

2386
02:18:13,671 --> 02:18:15,860
could take over your life.
You know when a,

2387
02:18:15,861 --> 02:18:20,270
when a girl will try to move in and like
offer you pussy to try to like control

2388
02:18:20,271 --> 02:18:22,310
your financial empire,
you'd be like pitch. Right.

2389
02:18:22,340 --> 02:18:25,440
I know where I can get some pussy stop.

2390
02:18:25,570 --> 02:18:27,680
We're dealing with
quantities and qualities.

2391
02:18:27,681 --> 02:18:30,730
We're dealing with a of a
commodities market here, right?

2392
02:18:31,170 --> 02:18:34,260
Yeah. I mean it's, it's,
it's unbelievable. David.

2393
02:18:34,261 --> 02:18:38,580
Someday you're going to find the
rancor and loves you for you. Oh girl,

2394
02:18:38,581 --> 02:18:41,550
a sensitive girl. The you, you're not
going to want to be with anybody. I know.

2395
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:46,110
She's going to be so beautiful
and have a 12 inch penis. Oh,

2396
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:50,050
and with that one.

2418
02:20:15,330 --> 02:20:19,990
Would it help if she did? No, Yoshi
didn't. That is really your back.

2419
02:20:20,470 --> 02:20:25,160
Everything's a gun. Damn play on
words. Yoshi male Wednesday night,

2420
02:20:25,161 --> 02:20:26,420
say Road Yoshi.

2421
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:32,260
Yoshi didn't and Yoshi will be at the Ice
House in Pasadena this Wednesday night

2422
02:20:32,331 --> 02:20:34,910
at 10:00 PM along with uh,

2423
02:20:35,070 --> 02:20:40,070
Ian Edwards along with Brian Red Band
along with Adam Hunter and one of the

2424
02:20:40,401 --> 02:20:44,030
motherfucker that I can't remember and
maybe many more, whoever's in town,

2425
02:20:44,031 --> 02:20:46,970
but the idea of the ice house, I'll
call Fitzsimmons to see if he's around.

2426
02:20:47,210 --> 02:20:52,130
The idea of the ice house is we just
try to put on shows there where we fuck

2427
02:20:52,131 --> 02:20:54,980
around, have a good time. We use
it as sort of a workout room.

2428
02:20:54,981 --> 02:20:58,880
It's the last time I did it, I came up
with like 20 minutes a new material.

2429
02:20:58,881 --> 02:21:02,180
You guys, these shows are fucking
amazing. They're so fun to do.

2430
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:07,040
And it's one of the best comedy
environments on the planet Earth.

2431
02:21:07,041 --> 02:21:09,860
It's a club that's been around
since 1960 and it's just like,

2432
02:21:10,010 --> 02:21:13,430
I can't say enough good things about
the staff or the the owner Bob.

2433
02:21:13,431 --> 02:21:15,110
He's the coolest motherfucker ever.

2434
02:21:15,320 --> 02:21:19,310
And to me it's really important to support
places like this because they're very

2435
02:21:19,311 --> 02:21:22,490
fragile. It's not a lot of
money and owning a comedy club.

2436
02:21:22,491 --> 02:21:26,330
And I want to help these people that
think about bailing out. All right,

2437
02:21:26,540 --> 02:21:27,261
I've got a desk,

2438
02:21:27,261 --> 02:21:31,130
squad.tv and you can pick up one of these
fucking Badass tee shirts designed by

2439
02:21:31,131 --> 02:21:35,330
our very own prion and there's
two different versions of it.

2440
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:39,890
There's this one that is a my favorite
cat and then there's that one, which uh,

2441
02:21:39,920 --> 02:21:43,550
I also like the design sign but you
can't buy that one anymore so you could

2442
02:21:43,551 --> 02:21:45,890
probably get that shit on Ebay.
You should just make more of those,

2443
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:48,290
make more of those. But the whole
point is that the point sucks.

2444
02:21:48,291 --> 02:21:52,700
The point sucks up right. Delicious
Syphilis Lid, written cock.

2445
02:21:52,920 --> 02:21:55,640
Good night folks.
We will see you tomorrow.

2446
02:21:56,270 --> 02:21:58,400
Most likely with the Aubrey Marcus.

2447
02:21:58,401 --> 02:22:02,180
I'm going to try to move some shit around
cause Arby's in town and a Rick Ross

2448
02:22:02,181 --> 02:22:05,090
lives here so we'll call him.
We'll make everything happen.

2449
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:09,560
We are going to get our freak on one
way or another. Bitches. David Cho,

2450
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:12,680
Yoshi, thanks Joe. Thanks.
Thank you guys. Yeah. Awesome.
