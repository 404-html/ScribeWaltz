1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,020
Ah,

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,300
the Joe Rogan experience podcast is
brought to you by the fleshlight.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,320
Got a fun new way to say that, Brian.
I can't keep saying it that way. Back.

4
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,040
This last slide is our sponsored.
Okay. This is the deal folks.

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:19,420
It's been very controversial,

6
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:22,540
but they've been with us since
the beginning and we are, uh,

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,040
we are anything if loyal or loyal,
if anything, loyal. If anything,

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,680
we're loyal people.
They've always been our sponsor.

9
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,780
And even though it's a
controversial subject, we,

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,980
Brian and I both feel the controversy
is very silly. What's the controversy?

11
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,570
Controversy is being sponsored.

12
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:42,370
That's Ari Shaffir lays gem and are the
great.com being sponsored by a sex toy

13
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:46,240
that it's, it's stupid. It's ridiculous.
But I have to show is nonsense.

14
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,910
This show we're talking about,
we're talking about sex toys.

15
00:00:48,911 --> 00:00:50,080
We're talking about nonsense.

16
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,970
It's not like there's this noble content
that's continuously being brought up on

17
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,430
the show and it doesn't deserve to
be associated with something like a

18
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,960
masturbation, do you mean? Right. Does
everybody must have to the fucking girls.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,520
It's so silly to me.
I will never give it up.

20
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:11,170
I won't give up the flush like, fuck you.
You're ridiculous. They're paying us.

21
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,110
They've always paid us. There's
nothing wrong with what they're doing.

22
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:17,050
If you think there's something wrong
with what they're doing, you're crazy.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,720
If you don't want to be
associated with them, good.

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,010
That means you're a silly person.
You're a silly person. What do you care?

25
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:26,920
It's nonsense. We are known to have
arguments like that. I'm always like, oh,

26
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,340
let's not even talk.
[inaudible] is ridiculous.

27
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,380
Really pretending that we
don't masturbate. Really?

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,000
Why would you not you silly person.
Have you ever pretended to masturbate?

29
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,640
No. When you pretended yeah,
like Ron Masturbate. Yeah.

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,080
Who were you trying to fool?
Will Brian,

31
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:46,450
do you remember the time you were going
to do that fucking movie and I talked to

32
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:47,284
you out of doing it,
man,

33
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,710
I'm just going to do a film where they
tied him up and a trunk of a car with his

34
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:54,460
girlfriend and I was like, Yo, you don't
want to have those videos out there,

35
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:57,500
first of all,
for people to get excited about what?

36
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,860
It's a very specific type
of porn. It's like a, um,

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,170
they want to see people that are kidnapped
and they want to see people that are

38
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:09,690
completely have fantasies of kidnapping
people they don't like maybe. Yeah.

39
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:12,040
And they don't,
they don't really go through with it,

40
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:16,060
but they want it like kidnap this guy
front of them, you fucking piece of shit.

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,500
I just allow guys to feel like that.

42
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:20,410
So they make it was going to be a fuck
film with you. Well don't you think of,

43
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:24,340
that's true. Michael C. Hall was somewhere
like, like shivering, crying, hiding,

44
00:02:24,341 --> 00:02:27,130
you know, the guy that played Dexter
or somebody like that. You know,

45
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,980
all these people that are
serial killers all, yeah.

46
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,290
Do you think that your have
to think about that? That's,

47
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:35,140
that is a real legit concern.
I mean when you look,

48
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:40,141
I'm not in any form or any way trying
to say that we should have any,

49
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,700
any kind of censorship in this world,

50
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,510
but the reality is there's people
that watch a show like Dexter and say,

51
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:50,480
I would like to do that too. Oh, have
you seen my Twitter Avatar, Doug?

52
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,320
I in Kennedy got arrested for doing the
exact same fucking three's company to

53
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,620
[inaudible] the guy even
filming the people in the
doing completely Dexter style

54
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,520
and then, oh, they tried to copy
it. Oh, he did do it. He did.

55
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:06,850
He was inspired by Dexter, so he went out
and killed a bunch of people. Oh really?

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Yeah. I tried to kill some bad people. If
you see my Avatar, what's your Twitter?

57
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,630
You would probably get really mad
at me if you saw my Twitter avatar.

58
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,360
Right Brian, where they were
going to keep fucking this thing.

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,690
What we're thinking of bucket fucking
this thing or is it just a film? No, no.

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,870
They were just going to kidnap
us and like tie us up and,

61
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,530
and then like going to do it for
money. Yeah. It's acting. Yeah.

62
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,970
Was actually seen that picture before.
Yeah. My heart's torn out and that,

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,910
that's like gory. You know,
there's blood dripping down my face

64
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,170
picture forever. Yeah,
it's gross. You should, uh,

65
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,130
you should be careful of those
things. It's, I mean, look,
it is what it is. I mean,

66
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,060
you're expressing yourself.

67
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,260
You feel the need to express yourself
getting murdered? Go ahead. Oh,

68
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:46,871
that's what I think.

69
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:50,110
There's a little something creepy about
putting out videos of you getting tied

70
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:54,820
up in your fucking truck.
Cause it might 99.9% of the people.

71
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,080
You're absolutely right.

72
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,840
That's nothing that's not going
to trigger anything weird.

73
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,000
But there's that one 10th of 1%
that just sees that and just thinks,

74
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,760
I would like to fucking do that to him.
Yeah.

75
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,720
Well I'm glad you talked me out of it so
I could torture my fleshlight like the

76
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:13,510
one that killed the president
cause of taxi driver. Exactly.

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,150
You can't really worry too much
about crazy flux flashlights.

78
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,890
A hell of a product. Torture you to
fleshlight fucking strangle that.

79
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,480
It was just before fuck stress. That
was the best fleshlight commercial ever.

80
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,760
If you're going to Joe rogan.net,
click on the fleshlight link,

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,360
entering the code name Brogan, you will
get 15% off. How's that flashlights?

82
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,580
Don't have hearts. They'd tell him, but
don't be mean to fuck it all. It's just,

83
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:37,720
it's a spiritual thing because people
that are mean to them and that's what I

84
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,910
get off on punching it.

85
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,900
We're also brought to you by
[inaudible] Dot com o n n I t,

00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,280
The other one is a little pumped
me up for your immune system.

90
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,240
It's all explained on on a.com it's all
stuff that I use and we use and it's all

91
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:05,260
right. Now, today is

March 19th until midnight.
It's 35% off.

93
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,760
If you just have a
single 30 count bottles,

94
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:17,170
if you just use the code on it
or excuse me, try it, try it.

95
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,240
So if you use the code t r y, I t just
today, if you're listening on Ustream,

96
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,910
iTunes, people probably mess this,
but there's always 10% off every,

97
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,361
every order.

You can always use the code named Rogan
and get 10% off and we stand by all this

99
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:36,670

guarantee on the first count of pills.

100
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,930
So if you buy like a 30 count bottle,
it's a 100% money back guarantee.

101
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:42,940
You don't have to return the product.
If you don't like it,

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,090
you just say you get your money back.
We are,

103
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,460
the most important thing is we are much
more concerned with not having a bunch

104
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,200
of people that feel like
they got ripped off.

105
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,720
Much more concerned with
that then with making money.

106
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,860
And it's all products that
I use and I believe in,

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,700
I've been a fan of nootropics and
vitamins and minerals for a long time.

108
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,990
And if you're interested in nootropics,
it's an o, o, t, r, O, p, I,

109
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,970
C S. And they're essentially nutrients
that a stimulate brain function.

110
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,350
They stimulate neurotransmitter's.
It's,

111
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,520
it's all fascinating stuff and it's
very controversial. Uh, but I, uh,

112
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,230
I've been a big supporter
of it for awhile.

113
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,300
So Google that go checkout nootropics,
checkout on it. Oh and and it,

114
00:06:22,301 --> 00:06:24,230
and if you want to buy anything,
use a code name. Rogan,

115
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,160
get yourself 10% off our right
freaks are either great. Is here

116
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,790
my pal Ari Shaffir ready to break shit.
Damn.

117
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,160
That was one of the greatest
[inaudible] wait for that.

118
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:42,380
I realize that's just music started.
I'm like, Oh, I want to wait for that.

119
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,120
Dan was the coolest shit ever when he
did that in the middle of the fucking,

120
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,190
when he said that, I was like, wow, we
just got the best commercial of all time.

121
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,030
Nick Diaz throws his arms up in the air,

122
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,090
says Joe Rogan got mad at me on
Twitter recently for, for um, for uh,

123
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,360
going against the suspension. We're
talking ill of it. Really the B,

124
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,840
well if folks don't know Nicky has get
suspended or he's in the process of a

125
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:10,690
hearing right now about
as a use of marijuana,

126
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:14,020
he only tested positive for
the metabolites in his system.

127
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,240
And I guess what his lawyer is arguing
is that metabolites aren't illegal and

128
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:21,180
that the marijuana is
illegal and you're not,

129
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,900
you're not allowed to have
marijuana in your system.

130
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,910
But you don't even have a
law firm metabolite. Oh,

131
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,800
I thought it was like
metabolites only remnants.

132
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:29,530
And the last time he was smoking when
he got those remnants was when he was

133
00:07:29,531 --> 00:07:31,150
legally smoking.
But the state of California,

134
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,890
the metabolite that actually was in
his system is an inert metabolite.

135
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:40,330
The metabolite that he tested
positive for is not psychoactive. Oh.

136
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,310
So the only thing that he tested positive
for was a non psychoactive cannabinoid.

137
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,090
There's, you know, I don't know
how many cannabinoids, I shouldn't,

138
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,850
I shouldn't talk about this
until I talked to Todd McCarthy.

139
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,900
Just let him smoke pot though.

140
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,100
It's not a performance enhancing
drug and it doesn't hurt the person.

141
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:01,180
I get in this argument with people. I get
in this argument with people. Um, and um,

142
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,730
a lot of people have been angry at me
about this because I've said that I think

143
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:07,990
marijuana is a performance enhancing
drug and it is, if you're good,

144
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,370
if you're good with pot, and it is,
if you're good with the martial arts,

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,720
it is enhancing it and it's, it's,
it's not necessarily enhancing.

146
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,370
Like you could give it to one guy and his
emotions and his nerves and everything

147
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:23,680
just because the fact that he's
about to enter into a cage fight.

148
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,920
It might overwhelm him and
he might just lose his shit.

149
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,330
But you could give it to like,

150
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,200
I guarantee you you could give some
weed to Bj Penn and he'd go out and fuck

151
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:36,670
people up. Yeah, Bj Penn. I don't think
he would have any problem with it.

152
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,970
He's an old gene. You know what I mean?
He's a veteran. You think he'd be better?

153
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,330
I think the Jujitsu, those
guys, those guys. Yeah,

154
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,580
those guys never roll sober.

155
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,610
You got to understand there's a lot
of these guys like high level guys

156
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,930
name any names because some people
don't like people talking about it.

157
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,801
So I'm going to tell.

158
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:58,590
But high level Jujitsu guys that
you've heard of [inaudible] videos and

159
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:01,170
everybody like mimics them with their,
their own game.

160
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,800
A lot of those guys smoke weed a lot.
Like,

161
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:09,120
it's a big picture and they smoke
weed and train. You know, and look,

162
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:12,330
I always go back to Eddie Bravo,
you know, cause he's my best friend,

163
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,270
but he's also one of the best
Jujitsu instructors in the world.

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,030
And I've never seen Eddie do
Jujitsu when he wasn't high.

165
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,880
It sometimes it gets so high, it's
really teaching. It's like any,

166
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,630
but he'll tell you,
he'll tell me that it enhances him.

167
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:28,050
He'll tell you that it
enhances the sensitivity. It
puts you in the flow better.

168
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,120
It lets you, okay, but so does, so does,
let's just say vitamin B or whatever else.

169
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
They're very different though.

170
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:38,700
Vitamin B is very good as far as
your body's ability to perform. Yes.

171
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,160
But not as far as being able to change
your state. The idea that, well,

172
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,360
the thing about marijuana is it's so,

173
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,110
it's so euphoric and it's
so mind expanding and it's,

174
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:52,740
it's what it does when you have the fam.
This is by the way, is not for everybody.

175
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,080
Obviously everybody's brain
works in different ways,

176
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,730
but with my personal experience,

177
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,710
I get this wave of understanding when I
get high and that prepares me for things.

178
00:10:01,711 --> 00:10:03,420
Man, that's one of the reasons
why I like to get high.

179
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:06,950
Before I do big giant shows.
It slows everything down for me.

180
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,770
I played poker tournaments, Huh?
Yeah. Pool is fantastic. Hi.

181
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,280
I play a ball better when
I'm high. I really, yeah.

182
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,100
That's another thing you'll say at a
tournament, you'll see all the poker pros.

183
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:21,300
You know you're wanting to do their
cars at bricks isn't an enhancer.

184
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,600
It is an enhancer. It just is. Do you
think it affects your judgment though,

185
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:28,050
to do stuff like, like in Jujitsu, like,

186
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,740
I mean you watch a movie stoned and it,

187
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,360
you might think it's awesome the next day.
You think it sucks.

188
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,570
If you're doing Jujitsu
with somebody or MMA,

189
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,380
maybe you would do something you normally
wouldn't do because you're thinking

190
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:44,130
something different, you know? Well you
could, but that could lead to Pepsi.

191
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,670
What you're saying is like,
hold on a second, but we,

192
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,070
you're saying is that you
would like make a big mistake.

193
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,150
I think that what makes me stick,

194
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,640
you'd just do something that
you normally wouldn't do.

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,250
Well that would be a positive though.
A lot of times.

196
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,860
As long as you're good again,
as long as you're good.

197
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,020
Because if you're a good Jujitsu player,

198
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,380
if you're a good grappler and you have
a fundamental understanding of where

199
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:06,360
you're supposed to put yourself,
where you're in danger,

200
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,550
where you're not in danger,
what can be done.

201
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,640
You know there's all these
moves tie into each other.

202
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:15,720
You know when you learn
how to do butterfly hooks,
butterfly hooks, you know, you,

203
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:18,960
you, you learn how to
manipulate people's bodies,

204
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,410
that that all of a sudden becomes a way
to move people around just like with

205
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:26,520
your hands. And that adds to all
these other techniques that you do.

206
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,890
So there's like,
there's,

207
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,100
there's like literally in a limitless
number of moves and positions.

208
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,750
I mean there's so many
different variations,

209
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,630
so many different counters
to those variations that you,

210
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:39,900
if you long as you have
a deep understanding of
positions and as long as you

211
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:41,940
have a deep understanding of
what's dangerous and what's not,

212
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,690
you're not going to usually put yourself
in a bad spot. He'll occasionally,

213
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:49,740
if you're training with friends,
you'll like say, can I do,

214
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,380
let me just try to do this
because you won't worry.

215
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,040
Like if you get mounted
or something like that,

216
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,680
you know, you, you know like in a
competition where it's for your life.

217
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,410
Whereas if you were in a fight,
you wouldn't try this position.

218
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,950
But I think that's where
a lot of like new cells,

219
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,020
it helps you like with standard word
helps you riff a little more like let me

220
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:05,621
try this.

221
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:10,090
But that can also lead to a bad place
where like my nowhere lock up man all the

222
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,610
time. We all, we both do
it all the time. I mean,

223
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:16,320
I did it this past week and a couple
of times a, um, it's like 203 fuckups.

224
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,410
It's like plenty of, but when you do a
new shit, when you're doing new shit,

225
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,910
especially like at the Ice House,

226
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:25,750
I did a lot of new shit this weekend and
you know I'm preparing for this special

227
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:27,250
in Atlanta,
which by the way,

228
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,880
if you go out of my Twitter feed or go
to Joe rogan.net there's a link for it.

229
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,410
It's war at the Tabernacle on four 20
and I'm going to be filming my special,

230
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,310
she already to sell it one show.

231
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,450
The first show is gone and then the
second one selling fast. So if you,

232
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,520
if you want to get it and I would
love to have you guys come down.

233
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:45,310
It's going to be a lot of fun. It's
going to be crazy. I'm psyched.

234
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,910
I'm psyched to do it in Atlanta too
cause I haven't been in Atlanta in a long

235
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:52,770
time. What is a tavern?
Nippon Napal I called

236
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,560
Brian. That's in the video. It is the
terra now. What is it like? What is that

237
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,100
like a nut? Because everyone acts like
bags. Everyone knows what one of those is.

238
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:10,910
I have never had gotten rid of one. It's
just the name, the tabernacle choir. Yeah.

239
00:13:10,911 --> 00:13:14,800
It's a nice, a nice name for something
for, well, it's like, I don't know.

240
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,030
I mean I should [inaudible].

241
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,990
I feel stupid for not knowing what it
told me. It was the tabernacle buffet,

242
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:27,860
I would say. Wow. It must be an excellent
buffet. I'm sure it's like it's fuck.

243
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,740
It's like Rolls Royce or something.
You know? It's like some name

244
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,890
a pedia residents are dwelling place.
Wow.

245
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,550
The Tabernacle Hebrew Bro. That's why
I don't, it's English. Your people man.

246
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,090
Yeah. Well that's what he,
the Tabernacle is a, a,

247
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,420
a residence or a dwelling place according
to the Hebrew Torah. Old Testament. See,

248
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:53,800
it just sounds annoying. Well, I
don't know how that got to Atlanta.

249
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:56,890
Is there a lot of Jews in Atlanta?
No. Christian started using it.

250
00:13:56,891 --> 00:13:59,200
Is that what it is? Yeah, I guess so.

251
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:02,290
Maybe that was the English
translation for them. For a hut. Huh?

252
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,170
That's interesting. So
it's just a house. It just,

253
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:08,810
it's like a super fancy way to
say house tabernacle. Never.

254
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,910
I've never known what that word meant.

255
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,480
So that's where we're at Tabernacle and
it's on four 20 which is just so silly.

256
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,270
We had, it's perfect. It's
so silly. We had to do it.

257
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,130
When you told me you were thinking
about it, I was like, no, dude,

258
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,170
that's probably just do that. No, I'm it.

259
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,500
It costs us extra money to do
it this way because they want,

260
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:27,850
everybody else wanted to do it the next
month, but I was like, you know what,

261
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,080
it's for 20 it's just so silly.
Yeah, let's just get in there,

262
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,210
get it did film and unformed 20
it's just so perfectly goofy.

263
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,870
You know I, it is. You
know, I mean fucking,

264
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,490
I love how Doug Benson does is for 20
shows four 20 in the afternoon because

265
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:49,480
look, yes, it's pro posture. It's,
it's silly, but, and we all agree on,

266
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,310
he's cut out everybody,
but it's hardcore

267
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,730
fans. He's getting, you know,

268
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,270
he's getting on up at four 20
in the afternoon on a Sunday.

269
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,750
Hey darn casual Doug Denson fans showing,

270
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,280
do you guys ever have a screen name
that had been there for 20 in it?

271
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,680
No. Dare you. You did. You did.

272
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,740
She ever have one that had 69 in it.
I probably,

273
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,490
I definitely had red band for 2012 brill.

274
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,930
Yeah. No, I never, I never
did AOL or something. Wait,

275
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,110
let me ask you a question though.
Oh, fuck it. No. Ask Wash it.

276
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:29,150
If it just enhances your, why
should certain those things
being an enhancer. Well,

277
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,170
it's all in.
What does it look?

278
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,290
Doesn't it is a reality is everything
you take is a performance enhancer from

279
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:40,250
vitamins too. Minerals to
a good diet. Isn't it just
what's harmful for your body?

280
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,080
That's what they started out low trying
to outlaw is what they're trying to do

281
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:48,590
is to try and stop low
level physical engineering.

282
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,680
And that's what steroids are low.
This low level.

283
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,850
It's inevitable that they're going to
come out with nanobots. It's inevitable.

284
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,610
They're going to have the ability to
literally change your genome. It's,

285
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,690
it's inevitable.
It's Kinda how it's coming.

286
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:06,140
It's going to have dr and this
deep six nine, here we go.

287
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,070
He was all genome that he a bull's eyes.
Everything might not be in our lifetime.

288
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,920
And I mean, it might be in another
lifetime after, uh, after us,

289
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:15,200
but some time if you look,

290
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:18,200
as long as we don't blow ourselves up
or get here will make everything better,

291
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,650
we're going to make things better.
There's no way then there's no,

292
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,110
there's no technological
wall they're going to hit.

293
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:27,410
These fucking guys are coming up
with incredible discoveries and these

294
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:30,860
incredible discoveries actually make
those other incredible discoveries easier.

295
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,730
So many,

296
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,720
all the technology essentially
works together as far as
like computer processing

297
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:39,470
power and as far as knowledge gained and
learned and you build on that instead

298
00:16:39,471 --> 00:16:41,870
of having to Redo those experiments
to get to a certain point,

299
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,240
you're already far,
far along the process.

300
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,430
And then these new minds just add to that.

301
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,370
They're going to figure out a way to
do something that's way crazier than

302
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,460
steroids. They're going to figure
out a way to make doctor Manhattan's,

303
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,880
they're gonna figure out a way to make
giant blue dunes with giant blue dicks.

304
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,050
And I mean it's going to be real. It's
going to be unstoppable. There's no,

305
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:03,890
once it comes,
once it becomes an actual technology,

306
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,280
once they get over the morals,
then it's only a matter of time.

307
00:17:07,281 --> 00:17:09,860
It's like a hundred years,
is it 200 years?

308
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
We will be unrecognizable
200 years from now.

309
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,400
If as long as we stay alive
and keep getting more and more,

310
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,770
we're trying really hard to fuck it up.

311
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,370
We're trying really hard to eat every
fish in the fucking ocean and then throw

312
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:28,520
all of our shit in there and
plastic will live longer.

313
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,290
They accomplish more
things. Yeah. But we're,

314
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,860
we're trying to still trying to fuck
up the ocean and overcrowd this place.

315
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,170
That's an issue. You know the, you know,

316
00:17:36,171 --> 00:17:40,250
they say you can produce enough food
and like one state of the country you're

317
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,100
going to take like North Carolina,
if you filled North Carolina with farms,

318
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,090
you could produce enough food to feed
the whole world. But I say fuck you.

319
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,720
You know, I say you're crazy.
I think your calculations

320
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,200
suck off.
Yeah.

321
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:56,910
He could barely have people scratch by
in North Carolina is not that big stupid.

322
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,030
And by the way, those people are
just going to make more people.

323
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:02,670
And then when are you gonna do you're
gonna move into South Carolina because

324
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:06,560
they go to and make with,
I'm going to assume,

325
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,600
assuming there was like a line up to
the door North Carolina right now,

326
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:12,150
I think we're okay and we'll probably
be okay for another generation,

327
00:18:12,151 --> 00:18:14,940
but we're eventually going to reach a
point in time where there's too many

328
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:15,774
people.

329
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,960
I mean we're okay here in America where
there are certainly not okay in other

330
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:22,110
parts of the world. Population
bomb, population explosion, right.

331
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,810
Rachel Carson and her husband
wrote books about it. Know,

332
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,370
but that's the number one pop a
problem for our population explodes.

333
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,910
And the Kansas state itself. Yeah. I mean
it has to cause it, it rebuilds the uh,

334
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,290
exponentially and instead of geometric,
so it's not like too this year, two more.

335
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,880
Next year or two more. It's like two then,
then five, then ninth and 20, you know,

336
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:45,330
20 which just keeps going. Fuck.
So it'll be the last minute.

337
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:47,610
I'll just go route and we'll just
fill this place up and we'll all just

338
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,330
humongous plague. Yeah. That's
a real issue, right? Yeah.

339
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,960
How do you stop that rain is going
to come, you know, you gotta wonder.

340
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,420
You got to wonder if you
know, human population, uh,

341
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,660
has like a, like a number,
like a cap to keep it at.

342
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,300
I think that's what aids is really a,
it's the plague.

343
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,590
It's all just nature's way
of, um, of balancing it out,
trying to fight it. Well,

344
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:13,230
how come they play today then?
That doesn't make any sense.

345
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:16,230
There's way more people,
way more people will weigh less plague.

346
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,080
I think things come up because
of it. Well, I think Sorta,

347
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:23,910
but we combat that with science doing
nature's way of combating it. Well, we're,

348
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,010
we're greedy bitches.

349
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,750
You want to stay alive off certain
diseases when it's presented with too many

350
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:32,540
calls. It's like I'm out.
Right? It's all my white blood
cells are gone. Right? Yeah.

351
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,940
Wonder what I mean? Somebody actually
brought that argument up recently.

352
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,840
I forget where it was,

353
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:42,050
but the idea was that a virus was
actually engineered that viruses and by

354
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,710
nutrition nearby nature to attack
humans keep us us off. Yeah.

355
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,940
Not fucked up. We just have a thousand
words. That's all we got left.

356
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,640
Thousand words.
What does Eddie Murphy movie

357
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,150
making bad moments
doesn't have enough money.

358
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,510
It doesn't have enough money and
another 0% on rotten tomatoes to ah,

359
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,300
just, you can just not make any movies
if you want. What do you have enough?

360
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:09,540
It's can't be about the money.
It can't be go back to comedy as well.

361
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,530
But that guy was hilarious, so I know
he can do that. We get some moments.

362
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,200
We got to get them on. We'd got to find
him. He doesn't smoke pot kind of. Really?

363
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,610
His brother does. Charlie's smokes weed.
I never smoked with him once he tried it,

364
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,820
I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure. How do
we think he didn't try and Charlie.

365
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,970
Charlie Murphy gets high as
full. Really? Yeah. He gets high.

366
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,890
He smokes blunts amongst those. Um, those
ones with the tobacco on the outside,

367
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,830
we got high. That was a totally
different high. That's weird.

368
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:41,080
That's a weird high man.
We were in the back of my tobacco's.

369
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,880
It make sense to leave by the way.
He had his bad. Here's the deal.

370
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,840
You're not supposed to smoke cigar leaves.
You just inhale the puff those,

371
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,300
but they're smoking.
They're inhaling them.

372
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,560
So they're taking these cigar leaves that
you're not supposed to be inhaling in

373
00:20:56,561 --> 00:21:01,090
the first place and they're inhaling
them with their weed. It's craziness.

374
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,360
Like not the way to do it, man. You know,

375
00:21:04,361 --> 00:21:08,320
they like to do those real Philly blunts.
Phillies fucked up like,

376
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:11,920
give me the worst shit. Just fucked
me up here. These are disgusting.

377
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,810
The idea that you have,
take one of those shoe cigars or suites,

378
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Shitty grandpa cigars and
actually inhale it all my time.

379
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,960
Once in a while you don't do it every day.

380
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:29,620
I had a couple cigars before.
They were like sweetened cigars.

381
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,000
Have you ever had those reforms?
Swisher sweets.

382
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,860
Grape ones are good. Get a
nice buzz. Offers a guard.

383
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,360
That's what people don't know.
You know,

384
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:43,540
a lot of people don't know you can
get just as high off a good cigars.

385
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:47,650
You can off shit for cigarette every
like once every few weeks. You know?

386
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,460
Like when I'm just in
college or when I just start.

387
00:21:49,461 --> 00:21:53,120
It was like when you have one it's like,
Whoa, that's a major bus. Yeah. Yeah.

388
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,430
The real deep tobacco buzz,
like especially real tobacco,

389
00:21:57,431 --> 00:22:00,910
like cigar tobacco. It's
nice. It's a nice feeling.

390
00:22:00,911 --> 00:22:03,490
I mean those dudes aren't doing
that just because it looks cool.

391
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,860
Like they're getting high,
they're getting high from that tobacco,

392
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:08,140
it's a weird high. You're
getting nasty. Sklar brothers.

393
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:11,290
I used to smoke before I play basketball
outside in the courts and I got picked

394
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,520
up on, so like, all right,
come on, we're starting.

395
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,070
So I had to like take my last few
puffs of a cigarette and this,

396
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,650
I forget it was Randy or Jason, but
one of them was like, all right,

397
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,720
you have to cut, strip, quit
smoking. I was like, I know,

398
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:22,150
I know it's bad for your health.
I'm like, I know. And they'll like,

399
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:24,940
it makes you stank. I'm like, I know,
I know. And like it's not cool. Like,

400
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,580
well that's where you're wrong.
Clearly it's cool.

401
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,330
That's the only reason anyone that's ever
started smoking. It's cool. It's cool.

402
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:36,100
How's it cool, cool people. That's just
always been a cool thing. It's been an,

403
00:22:36,101 --> 00:22:37,730
I don't give a fuck thing. Yeah. You know,

404
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,750
that's the reason why people smoke
cigarettes cause they don't give a fuck.

405
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,190
I don't give a fuck.
You know,

406
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:45,670
you see a private investigator and a movie
and he's taken a drag off a cigarette.

407
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,910
That guy doesn't give a fuck,
was not even not, you know,

408
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,600
he's feeding his own monster, feeding
his own monster, but it's cigarette.

409
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,860
It's funny, but actors, it is weird
because he never seen him in movies do it,

410
00:22:56,861 --> 00:22:59,270
but it's only when they're off.
I see a lot of them onset,

411
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,800
you seem to stamp out and I'm trying to
quit and they're always trying to quit

412
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,220
puffing the loss.
They just go until you're ready to quit.

413
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,970
And I quit one of the best attorneys
on a set and everybody's high.

414
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,150
When you get on one of those sets,
everybody's high.

415
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:16,980
All the writers are high and the
actors getting high directors high.

416
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,200
Those are the real
movies we did me and run.

417
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:23,200
It's easy to those tiger woods commercials
and so then he left and we had to

418
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,570
keep talking trash, shoretel ourselves.
We play the video game right.

419
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:26,221
And they were like one,

420
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:28,810
some beers look okay and they
just started giving us beers.

421
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
The production company,
you're talking trash,

422
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:33,820
whatever and like wanna smoke some
pot and we're like, you better not,

423
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:38,920
we're not going to get any work done,
but it's very cool. That's awesome.

424
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:42,910
Yeah. If you're with a good group of
people, man, they want to have fun.

425
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,680
That's the way to have fun.
You know what I mean?

426
00:23:44,681 --> 00:23:46,040
Thinking about how we do the podcast,

427
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,920
you know we get high before
every single one of them.

428
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,480
W W rose doing the ice houses drunk. Yeah.
I brought a bottle of wine last night,

429
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,960
brought a bottle of wine. We're drinking
wine on a paper or plastic cups. I not,

430
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,180
it's fucking great man.
It was decent wine.

431
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:08,540
Kava Aretas Cabaretta has deli
in Canoga Park that place today,

432
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,080
that Italian place. Holy Shit.
Is that place good? Really? Yeah.

433
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:14,930
I picked up a bottle of wine
and some sandwiches. Boom.

434
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,950
It's the only place here on the west
coast where you can get like real east

435
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:23,570
coast Italian food Cabaretta is.
Yeah, it's in, it's in Canoga Park.

436
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:27,140
It's fuck. Sandwiches
are amazing. They have,

437
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,820
they have a sausage and pepper sub that
I can not not get get it every time.

438
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,950
I always say, well, I'm an
experiment this time. Nope.

439
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,240
I got to get the sausage and pepper
because it's so ridiculous to eat a whole

440
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,290
one. You have to be some kind of massive,
it's ridiculous. It's preposterous.

441
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,140
You have to be some just crazy
glutton to eat a whole one.

442
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:47,060
I have eaten a whole one, but
that's what I thought. Yeah.

443
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:50,480
I'm sure you have your own animal
and we took Joe. Really? Yeah.

444
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,730
I've seen you a greasy Tony's,
whatever those places where,

445
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,310
where you've got the garbage pail.
Yeah, whatever it was and I was like,

446
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:59,180
got the small is way too much for me.
Then you're just killing years. I'm like,

447
00:24:59,181 --> 00:25:04,040
fries please. What's that?
That sub is, Dan was dangerous.

448
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:07,040
That was like grease utility at Gracie.
That was like liquid death.

449
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Tony died of heart failure at 52 I only
had like seven and I think he was in his

450
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:16,760
sixties I think it was in his 60.
You might actually even been seven.

451
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,310
He actually looked good for his age.
He looked a lot.

452
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:22,690
He looked a lot younger than he was.
But yeah, he did die of a heart failure.

453
00:25:22,691 --> 00:25:26,210
It's like 24 when a guy named
Greasy Tony Dies of heart failure.

454
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,060
But I'll tell you what, man, I
always love being around that guy.

455
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:33,830
We got pictures for years.
Tony's, this was in Tempe, Tempe,

456
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:37,610
Arizona, right across the street from
the Improv. There was this 24 hour, uh,

457
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:42,050
Italian joint run by this guy from
Jersey and he was a great old character.

458
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,240
We would just hang out there
after the shows. It was just,

459
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,080
he was sold like cool to
be around like just to,

460
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:51,590
to to get to hang out with a real
character like that guy, you know,

461
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,400
like you look in the walls was all
the kids pictures when he was young.

462
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:59,270
Like his sons are all flexible
picture of the Godfather,

463
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:04,271
a picture of the sign by Sylvester
Stallone and it's like so classic old East

464
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,380
Coast Italian.
It's like just any was so friendly.

465
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:12,380
It was like such a nice guy that
like you would go there. I was like,

466
00:26:12,381 --> 00:26:14,190
you know like going over your
friend's living room or something.

467
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:19,100
It just happened to be behind the
counter. He was hugging you and shit.

468
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:24,230
Crazy. Tony was awesome. What a great
guy. And the food was fucking perfect.

469
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,570
When you're hammered and you coming off
of a two shows at the Tempe Improv. Yeah,

470
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,760
let's go eat.
And you have one of those subs,

471
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:35,360
those fucking steak subs that he had the
thing called the garbage pail that you

472
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:39,190
were talking about. What does it weigh?
Four pounds, five pounds? I don't know.

473
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:44,100
It was ridiculous. Gross and it was
direct. No bullshit. It was close

474
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,970
to two feet long. Let me soak
this an oil before you eat it too.

475
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,440
It was in the oil on not bullshit
and it was at least 18 inches long.

476
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,530
They were fucking huge.

477
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:55,440
They would cut him in half and
each one of them each half.

478
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:57,870
Would it look like a big sub?
Yeah. I like this is too much.

479
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,690
That's half is too much and I
would eat the fucker. That shit.

480
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,770
It was like the leg of Esther.
That's pretty much what I was like.

481
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:07,830
Whenever we order food at a restaurant
and you go first and then the waitress

482
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:09,940
was like, all right, thank you. And
she'll, she starts to leave you like,

483
00:27:09,941 --> 00:27:13,800
and then no, no, no. That's just for me
to hear. My friends want have to show us.

484
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,410
She was like, what? Famished. I
get famished after shows. You know,

485
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:19,800
you think about the energy that you
put out when you're on stage, you know,

486
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:23,100
just focusing and managing everything.
It's a lot of mental energy,

487
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,940
physical energy around. It's
a lot of energy. You know,

488
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,580
it's a big burns, Alana.
Alana, lock on it.

489
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,690
You have to be in shape to do set up to
do it right. I mean everyone, I mean,

490
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:35,010
you could do it if you're out of shape,

491
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:38,040
but guarantee you it'd be better if you
were in shape. You know what I mean?

492
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:42,780
A guy like Ralphy look how much better
would Ralphie may be if he weighed 180

493
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:47,640
pounds? Yeah. Jesus Christ. I mean, his
timing, the way his brain would work,

494
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:49,020
the way his body would move.
You know,

495
00:27:49,021 --> 00:27:52,140
it's amazing when I see a guy like you
could definitely a lot more physical.

496
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,860
I think about how many shows he does, how
much energy that is. That's incredible.

497
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:59,390
What [inaudible] pants sizes.
That's great. Well, yeah.

498
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,030
You had some serious health issues,
right? Yeah. He stopped smoking weed.

499
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,310
He said his doctor told
him to stop smoking.

500
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:08,520
I don't know if he stopped eating it.
No. His stuff getting it to really, yeah.

501
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,790
He said that's the stuff in there.
Say Goodbye to all that funny shit.

502
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,800
He doesn't mind if it's longer route,
but he, uh, yeah, his immune system's,

503
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:22,740
I'll shut the hell. Wow. That's
crazy. Yeah, man. He was, um,

504
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,220
obviously you, you cannot get
that bag. He's a Ralphie's. Uh,

505
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:30,300
even if you don't know Ralphie May,
he's probably about 500 pounds at least.

506
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:32,490
Right. It is the sweetest guy
in the world. He's so sweet.

507
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,150
That's so worried about him. Does he
sound all we all worry about them? Well,

508
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,730
it's a loses weight. They'll definitely,
it was voice will change for sure.

509
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,770
So having like a British
accent [inaudible] royal.

510
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,950
So you still smoking the
weed? Yeah, he uh, yeah.

511
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,730
I don't know what makes
someone get that big.

512
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,560
I would be out of my out
of school to talk about it.

513
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:57,340
I don't know if it's biological.
It's,

514
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,450
it seems to me that it's a very
recent phenomenon in human history.

515
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,350
I don't think people got that
big a couple hundred years ago,

516
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,430
is losing weight now. He, he, he got put
true stout, who's big chain pictorial.

517
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,480
Kristen is really fun in New
York comic. Massive. Those, wait,

518
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,680
I have to produce died. It's the same
thing. It's like wake up calls everybody.

519
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:20,910
Yeah. You know, it's very important.

520
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,730
It's very important to take care of your
fucking body. We're all gonna go man.

521
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:25,320
But you don't need to go early.

522
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:29,250
You don't need to go because that's going
to be a terrible feeling to go because

523
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:33,130
you treated your vehicle like shit.
That's not, that's not what you should do.

524
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,580
It this benefit in DC for
this comic who didn't have,

525
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,930
who had a stroke but
didn't have insurance,

526
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,570
every third common cause like,
Oh this will be for me in six months.

527
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,560
But it's like, it will be, you guys
are all getting fatter. Stop. You know,

528
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,270
and this really brings up a really
interesting point, um, because, um,

529
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,830
the ability when someone is
fucked, when they're, they're done.

530
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,720
When you're paralyzed from the neck down,

531
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,020
he can't move the ability to terminate
their own life and trying to decide like,

532
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,171
you know,
some of them can,

533
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:10,060
like they can blank and move a cursor
and stuff and they can like write things

534
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:12,000
like, I want to die. Please kill me. Yeah.

535
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,180
There was a woman who wrote this
article and this woman's name is Allison

536
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,150
Pearson and she wrote this
article about, uh, do any of us,

537
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:23,320
however ill have the right to die.
And this was her argument.

538
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,750
Her argument was that you just don't have,

539
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:29,020
it is one of the dumbest fucking,

540
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:34,050
most simple tin mouth diarrhea
takes on the subject I've ever read.

541
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,440
It's not thoughtful. It's silly. Of
course you have the right to die.

542
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,340
It's your own rights are given to us by
others in order for us to live together.

543
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,200
But it's like you can do whatever she
wants yourself. Yeah, I mean it's,

544
00:30:45,201 --> 00:30:48,460
it's quite, what do you mean? It's
completely preposterous? I mean it's,

545
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:51,100
it's one of the dumbest arguments
than anyone can ever make.

546
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,740
And it's just a really, so what
she said, well, she saying, well,

547
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:56,890
she said that I didn't want to read
because it's, it's, it's horrible.

548
00:30:56,891 --> 00:31:00,400
But the point is she contradicted
herself because she had actually written

549
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,530
another one. Um, uh,

550
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:06,640
another article a couple of years back
where she was praising a woman for

551
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:11,641
killing her daughter because her daughter
had a fatal disease and she was just

552
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:16,050
slowly suffering. So the right to kill
others, but not ourselves. It was,

553
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,140
it's preposterous. She also wrote a
really dumb article. We hired her.

554
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:21,170
She,

555
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:25,930
she writes for some English
newspaper and she's just ragging Bob,

556
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,880
maybe 24,
seven.

557
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,060
She writes for the any chance he meant
that as a double play on the word rag.

558
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,050
She writes for the Telegraph.
So here's my point. So, um,

559
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,620
the other day I look on my website and
there's a thread says women versus Doug.

560
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:43,420
Stan hope saga. Oh, what are the fucking
dog to this will be great by the way.

561
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:48,220
Doug's latest C D is fucking fantastic.
You know, they haven't heard it.

562
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:53,050
It's great. It has made me like, I, you
know, you know what's great when you,

563
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:55,660
you know,
you hear a guy and I gotta be honest,

564
00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,160
his last one that he did in Norway,
the Oslo one, it wasn't my favorite.

565
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,370
It wasn't my favorite out of his stuff.
And I love Doug. He's fucking awesome.

566
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,810
But this one man,

567
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:09,700
it's almost like he rebounded from that
one just like with new renewed vigor and

568
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:13,870
hate and, and just fucking
and attacked. It's great.

569
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:16,090
It's so good.

570
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,160
Like there's some really fucking
hard laughs in it. Yeah, it's great.

571
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,350
It's one of my favorite standup comedy,
uh, cds in years. It's my favorite.

572
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:29,950
I think it's my favorite of Doug's. I
think he just, whatever the fuck he did,

573
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,030
whether I, you know, he even talks about
it. Oh, he turned a corner as a person.

574
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,070
He doesn't give a fuck anymore.
It's just trying to have fun.

575
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,810
He's not trying to change
the world. He's, you know,

576
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:41,810
he thought he was going to try to change
world at one time. I realized, dude, yeah,

577
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:46,220
he's just here to tell Dick Jokes
and, and, and it's fucking great.

578
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:51,370
It's great. And so I had, um,
uh, tweeted about it and, uh,

579
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:54,740
I, it's hard to follow everything
the fuck that's going on on Twitter.

580
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:59,930
So I didn't see this women
versus Doug Stanhope thing.
So I go to Stan, Stan hope,

581
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,410
read what this woman had wrote and uh,

582
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,760
let me find the exact quote
because it was pretty inflammatory.

583
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,420
Something about, uh, he, um, I think he,

584
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,500
he said that he hopes she gets a cyst
three, right? This, yeah. I mean,

585
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:22,150
he's just really angry at this
article and you know this,

586
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,600
that's a Stan hope. Does. He gets fired
up and he, you know, he wants to, uh,

587
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,460
figure out some way to, you know,
to turn this rage into comedy. Um,

588
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:34,070
so, uh, what is his exact quote?

589
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,000
I know shit. I can't
find it. I think he at,

590
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,850
he said that he wished a,
uh,

591
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:46,100
a cyst on her ovaries or
something like that. Yeah.

592
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,010
I can't even find it. He
might've actually tails, well,

593
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:53,440
he might have actually taken the
first quote down. Really? Yeah.

594
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,560
I got a lot of flack for it. I don't
know. That doesn't seem like camps.

595
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,810
What was the, what was the thing?
Women against Doug. Stan hope. Yeah.

596
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,500
I can't find it. That's not
backlash. Well, this is what's crazy.

597
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,960
So Doug Stan hope calls her a
cunt and uh, you know, he was, uh,

598
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,880
he said that she was fucking ridiculous
and there's a shit article and it's

599
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:15,020
about something that is very near and
dear to Doug because that's what his mom

600
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:18,710
had to do. His mom had to
take her own life. So yeah.

601
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:22,760
So for [inaudible] from the
Mancho, yes. So for some,

602
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,680
some smug asshole to,
to come.

603
00:34:27,681 --> 00:34:28,640
And you know,

604
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:33,550
and just pass judgment like this and then
do it with such poor thinking. It just,

605
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:38,240
it's really poorly written and it reeks
of a mediocre mind. It reeks of an, uh,

606
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,560
someone who is just,

607
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,430
they're not capable of grasping how a
lot of other people are going to see this

608
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:48,290
and that they don't have enough
perspective to tackle this complex issue.

609
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,600
And that's, it's insulting.
It's insultingly dumb.

610
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:53,330
And so Stan hope you
know Cheryl Otis Lady.

611
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,510
So her response was to create this women
against Doug stand hope page on fear of

612
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,460
on Facebook and yeah,
women is so it's also on Twitter.

613
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,900
I'm women versus Stan hope on
Twitter and women versus standard.

614
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:12,770
Why women Facebook exactly
the right to die. Exactly. No,

615
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:14,750
because cause he asked for assist.

616
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,770
Oh cause he said called her con and
she said he hopes she gets assist.

617
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,810
Can we anyone join? I think
the Fed it ovarian cyst. Yes.

618
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,820
Well that's the problem.
This is what I was gonna say.

619
00:35:25,821 --> 00:35:30,230
The problem is the only people that join
women versus Stan Hall, both on Twitter,

620
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,980
me and on Facebook. Me To join. No,

621
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:38,100
it's me and all the fucking Stan hope
fans from the rogue and board and all

622
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,430
the people who heard about this.
So they all join.

623
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,070
Nobody's gonna fucking women versus
stint bitch. Get the fuck out of here.

624
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,120
There's a few crazy hookers that are
looking to get mad at any guy who says

625
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:51,920
anything bad to any of them. Just
hear a quote. Women against so much.

626
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,470
She's always,
sure I'll sign up for a course.

627
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,040
I read one where this one ladies
take on it, you know, massage Dennis,

628
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,760
like standing up like, what are you
fucking talking saying dummy. This is a,

629
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,800
you know, yeah, he made
a personal attack on her,

630
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,070
but that's not the important part.
The important part is,

631
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:13,130
this is nonsensical argument by a fucking
Dullard saying that really terminally

632
00:36:13,831 --> 00:36:18,270
ill people who are in horrible straits
shouldn't be able to stop their time on

633
00:36:18,271 --> 00:36:20,580
this life.
It's somehow or another what is,

634
00:36:20,581 --> 00:36:23,400
there's some grand plan
that has to pay out.

635
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,040
Is there some pill that you
know about that we know?

636
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,840
Is there some new leaf
that we're going to find?

637
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,830
The Amazon that restores his 80 year old
guy who's paralyzed from the neck down.

638
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,920
Jesus fucking Christ. Bitch, you
don't know what you're talking about.

639
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,980
You're talking nonsense and you shouldn't
be allowed to be in a position where

640
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:41,880
you have an opinion that can be
expressed and then can influence people.

641
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,390
Fucking stupid for them.
She worked for, yeah,

642
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,790
she works for this fucking newspaper,
man.

643
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,470
This is why I tried to save her telegraph,

644
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,090
arguing with the bullet
and because I'm like,

645
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,610
I don't want this to be about
a female or male at all.

646
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,770
Like I just want you to
know that you're stupid.

647
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:00,540
So I try not to use gender specific words.
Yeah, this is, uh, it's just, you don't,

648
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,440
you don't have to gender
specific with this lady. I
haven't, I don't think I have,

649
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,430
but unless I called her a bitch.
But the way I say that,

650
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:09,720
I call them and say that's what
happens with Doug. He was my boss.

651
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:13,910
It's not his fault, but that's what they
latch onto. I use with my best friends.

652
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,280
I was like, bitch, you crazy. I mean,
I'm not saying she's a bitch as a woman,

653
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:19,860
but that's what I,
that's what they latch onto.

654
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,340
Why you hate for you to talking about?
Well, because they want to be able to say,

655
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,810
you hate women course I do

656
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,970
worst. The women, I don't hate them, but
as a whole, like they look down on them.

657
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:37,740
He definitely looked down on them is
I looked down on men too.

658
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,420
There's a lot of men out
there that are pictures.

659
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,500
I run into a lot of very unfortunate men
out there in this world that if I was a

660
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:47,940
woman, I would be sad if I was a woman and
I wanted to have a real man. Good luck.

661
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,430
Good luck finding one
of those fucking things.

662
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,840
There's like a specific type
of female drunk that I hate,

663
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:54,990
but there's also a specific type
of mail junk that I hear you, dude.

664
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:58,560
I would way rather be a guy.
Then B. I think there's way
more women that are cool.

665
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,690
Then there are men that are cool.
It's tuning me.

666
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:03,450
Douche bags out there that have some
weird chip on their shoulder. You know,

667
00:38:03,451 --> 00:38:07,140
there's some weird need to prove
themselves and this is just too many

668
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,300
aggressively cunty men, you know, I
think there's a lot of country women,

669
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:16,080
but I think it's way more country men.
He's just fucking people.

670
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,120
There's a lot of guys that
are just going like this,

671
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:22,470
just their chest and trying to like and
like why, why, why are you fighting?

672
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:26,320
What are you doing? See never who wants
this to never train. If you just trained,

673
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,390
they would never do that.
You know,

674
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:30,930
you go to a bunch of guys who are like
Jujitsu guys go out there like the nicest,

675
00:38:30,931 --> 00:38:35,560
most polite people ever. You know, it
can be easier. It's way easier. Stupid.

676
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:37,750
You know? I realized, you know that
sometimes I used to do this thing,

677
00:38:37,751 --> 00:38:40,330
I don't do it anymore where it's like
you're at a yellow light and trying to

678
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:43,420
like pause far enough so the car behind
you misses the light and you get to go

679
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,380
through it.
But I'm like,

680
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:47,920
the amount of energy that takes to do
that would be equal to the amount of

681
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:51,970
energy to speed up and get the guy in
behind you. The game works either way,

682
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,360
you're trying to accomplish
something total can't move.

683
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:58,490
It's like you can be nice to still
have the fun of the, of the game. Yeah.

684
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,850
Yeah. I think it's, I think people just
get locked into a wave. It's absolutely,

685
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,400
people get locked into a way of
thing and we get also get locked into

686
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:07,234
frustration.

687
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,630
Some of the most aggressive people
I've met word the most unsuccessful,

688
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,400
the most frustrated.

689
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,060
The reason why they were just like
constantly involved in conflict.

690
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:19,150
It's because they were dealing with
a lot of internal conflict and no

691
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:23,920
confirmation of, of, of anything
good. No confirmation of goodness.

692
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,660
It's from their life.
You know,

693
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:28,090
there's no confirmation of
them being worth something.

694
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:30,910
They were always getting dumped
in relationships or you know,

695
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,620
in the middle of fighting with their
boss and just shit on either side. Yeah,

696
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:36,160
there was always conflict.

697
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,390
And when you're in that situation that
that constant state of that's your norm

698
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:44,500
of unease comes, you're like your, your
base plan. It's fucking, it's the worst.

699
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,560
It's worst to you around. Yeah.
It's the worst to be around,

700
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,820
but the reality is you and I have it
far easier than the average person.

701
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,550
There was a threat on
the underground give.

702
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,380
I think the average person isn't like
that. I think that's a lot of people,

703
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:58,390
but the average person. Cool.
You're absolutely right.

704
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,970
But I'm saying the average person is
under a lot more stress. It doesn't,

705
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:05,080
it seems like standup comics will be
under a lot of stress and we sort of are,

706
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:07,870
but we're also a different
stress. Yeah. There was,

707
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:11,020
there was a threat on the underground
talking about Sunday night,

708
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,590
and the guy's like, man,
fucking Sunday night, he just,
some dude just reached out.

709
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:16,990
He goes, Sunday nights
are depressing, you know?

710
00:40:16,991 --> 00:40:21,640
Do you guys find Sunday depressing
and focking? Everybody's like, yes,

711
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:24,370
I hate Sunday nights.
I hate going back to work.

712
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,060
It makes me sick and I'm sitting
here, I'm just relaxing. I'm dreading.

713
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:30,790
I'm dreading that. I got to go to
work in the morning and I'm like, wow,

714
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,530
that's when you really realize how stupid,
lucky we are.

715
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,450
Just stupid.
Lucky to be stand up to me.

716
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:41,050
I've been stupid lucky across
the board and even fear factor.

717
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:45,010
I never woke up and was like really
mad that I had to go and make retarded

718
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,330
amounts of money to I.
I do that.

719
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,540
It wasn't my favorite thing to do but I
was never mad at it but the dude's like

720
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:52,060
stand up or anything like
that will work for the UFC.

721
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,860
It doesn't even feel like a job.

722
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:57,160
It's something that actually when I'm
like tired and I don't want to go to some

723
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:59,770
awesome Gig or get on the plane
to go some great place, I'm like,

724
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:01,060
I have a worse than Ethiopia.

725
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,570
Just like put it out how it
is like a relaxed though.

726
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:05,990
You're going to complain but keep up,
keep it.

727
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,580
Say it out loud and she put that on your
wall. I have it worse than Ethiopia.

728
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,200
It'll force you to just not be a bitch.
This ice cream is melting.

729
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:19,010
I have it worse than Ethiopia.
Yeah, there's, I'm like,

730
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,550
let me complain,
but obviously I'm going fine.

731
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:25,000
It's super easy to get
into a shit mindset.

732
00:41:25,001 --> 00:41:27,130
But the bottom line is
that life is a struggle.

733
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:29,500
It's a constant struggle
and doing anything.

734
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,740
It's a struggle like we were talking
about and you know, writing new material.

735
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,700
We're both doing that right
now. We're both, you know,

736
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,550
you'd go up but sometimes it
just eats Dick. It's not working.

737
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,000
It's sometimes you don't know where you're
going with something cause it's a new

738
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:41,990
bed and you're trying,

739
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,890
you try to say it one way and now he
tried another way but then it sort of

740
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:49,700
diffuses the second part of it and then
you've got to listen to it and go over

741
00:41:49,701 --> 00:41:52,580
it and maybe rewrite it. It's a
weird process. Sometimes you're like,

742
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:54,890
okay this section just needs work
and then the next time you're like,

743
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,890
it's telling me it's work and
the next time like dammit.

744
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,100
And it's something that is coming. Bits
just show up done. Oh yeah. You know,

745
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,960
sometimes like you get an idea and I
have gotten an idea on the way to a show

746
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,810
and then got to the show and then boom,
the bit was done and it was killer.

747
00:42:09,811 --> 00:42:12,770
It kills like an old bit,
you know,

748
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:16,700
one of my bits from my Facebook thing
the first time you said it. Yeah.

749
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,270
Which Facebook thing? Wait
a minute, I don't, I'm not
trying, I don't want to run.

750
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:24,610
One of your drugs are special.
If, if, uh, the premise,

751
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,080
if they had Facebook and
like 1800 hundreds. Oh yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

752
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,910
yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, that one came
out like immediately, like, yeah,

753
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:34,810
that was that night. It was
theater. I forget what. Yeah. Yeah.

754
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,190
Sometimes that's really fun.
That's a tag though.

755
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:41,060
That was sort of easy because it was,
the big premise had already been set. Oh,

756
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:45,860
right. You were saying the whole thing.
Yeah. But um, it's, it's weird, man.

757
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,310
The, the process is so weird the way
the process of creating new stuff,

758
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:52,700
but it's so exciting too. It just
gets you like real stimulated. Like,

759
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:56,570
that's my favorite time because it's
the most unsteady time you're going out

760
00:42:56,571 --> 00:43:00,990
there with all these like fucking weak
ass weapons. It's like you're playing,

761
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,320
it's like become a bad motherfucker.
Starcraft or world of Warcraft.

762
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,020
I'm going to Mike Tyson and punch
out and you're like, what the fuck?

763
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,930
It just knocks you out in two shots and
then you quit and then you start all

764
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:16,310
over again. Yeah. With the new account.
That's a better example. And you're like,

765
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:19,640
what? Yeah, you're a noob
with shit. We played,

766
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:21,320
we played the thing.

767
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:24,220
We have [inaudible] we got to play tiger
woods golf with tiger woods. Right,

768
00:43:24,221 --> 00:43:27,050
right. And he drove it off the tee
wants and he like went into this creek.

769
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:30,530
He was like, I couldn't clear the
creek. It was like 140 yards. Like yeah,

770
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:33,650
welcome to regular PR, PR,
PR people. Golf Tiger. Yeah.

771
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,260
I'm just mumbling cause he was like,
that's a regular people do it.

772
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,260
I tried that, I got stuck in like a
right, right there. That's in a skiff.

773
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:46,760
Worst feeling. And you're on a stage
in the middle of a fucking perfect Joe.

774
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:50,630
And be like, come on body, stop it.
You're Bonnie. Just hiccups. I don't word.

775
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,600
Oh God damn.
I'm running this whole moment.

776
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,560
I almost did that this week and I paused
myself and it actually made the joke

777
00:43:57,561 --> 00:44:01,760
better. Oh really? I almost fucked
up. I had an almost fuck up where uh,

778
00:44:01,761 --> 00:44:05,780
where was I felt it come out, twist
it. Like why does my tongue this shape?

779
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,920
I paused and extra second that I paused
and extra section after the word after I

780
00:44:09,921 --> 00:44:11,980
got it correct.
And it was like a better pause.

781
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:16,850
It was chance buy stuff on
accident. Right? Oh. Like I
realized, I was like, Oh yeah,

782
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:19,700
that gives you more time. This I am saying
something kind of crazy right there.

783
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,990
Maybe it's better to contemplate it
for a moment. Political for you here.

784
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,890
The second step is sometimes you know,
stand up is it's just technical. Yeah.

785
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:32,040
And you do it in front of
different people. You know,
you got an, that's the only

786
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,210
art form that I know of where
you literally need them to
practice it in front of.

787
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,250
I need, I don't know. I know some of
this stuff is, that's funny. You know,

788
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:43,410
when I write it, I know some of
the stuff that's going to kill,

789
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:44,550
but some of the stuff,

790
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,430
every now and then it's some shit that
you didn't even think it was funny.

791
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,520
He thought it was like
laughing and washes.

792
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:53,460
It could be like the biggest
throwaway to you and it just,

793
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:55,050
and that's like the
biggest laugh of the job.

794
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,470
Find a lot of times that I'll do certain
jokes that I really enjoy that may or

795
00:44:58,471 --> 00:44:59,790
may not get us bigger laugh,

796
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,940
but I'll do the jokes that get a humongous
laughed and I'm like, yeah, I like it,

797
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,830
but it's not my favorite.
But you guys seem to like it,

798
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,320
so I'll keep that in there.
So you're listening to these
ones that I want to say?

799
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a tool.

800
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,090
There's no substitute for fucking
doing it on stage in front of people.

801
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:15,300
There's no way around it.
So I used to hear about bill Cosby.

802
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,950
Bill Cosby would just write his whole
routine and then just like go on the

803
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,940
tonight show and just do it. Yeah,
he just did it. He would say,

804
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,830
he just knows what funny is it
certain people like us go differently.

805
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,340
I would like to see that dude, if he's in
town, you want to see him with me? Yeah,

806
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,050
I totally, I bet. I bet he
comes to town like once a year.

807
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,660
First Time I tried to leave the day before
he was there and I was really upset.

808
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,021
Yeah.

809
00:45:34,021 --> 00:45:38,850
I like to see him because it's hard when
you hear a lot of the veteran comics

810
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:42,200
talk about him because he's reached his
deity status and if you can't take it

811
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:44,970
out on us,
because I remember the one time,

812
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,900
you know obviously George Carlin's one
of the all time greats is no doubt about

813
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:51,250
it. It's like one of the greatest
comedians at several lives.

814
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:54,720
But there was a time where he was coming
to the comedy store and he was working

815
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:58,830
on some new stuff and it was not good his
last or second or maybe third the last

816
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:01,820
special. But yeah, it was
like, no, it wasn't good. There
was one good bit in there,

817
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:06,830
their hour and we all kind of sat
around and non and no one wants to say

818
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:10,930
anything and you know, and maybe you and
I got together and we were like, yes.

819
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,630
It wasn't going private,
it wasn't good.

820
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,140
But meanwhile he's fucking one of
the greatest of all time. But yeah,

821
00:46:16,141 --> 00:46:19,770
you have to say like, I'm
not taking anything away from
his overall achievements.

822
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,790
There's that moment and it really,
the reason was there's a reason for it.

823
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:25,440
It wasn't that he wasn't
a good comic anymore,

824
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,590
it's that he had an
incredible workload and he's,

825
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,010
he did the Louis C k thing where he's in,
but he was the originator of it.

826
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,490
He would come up with a completely new
act every do it like a dozen or two dozen

827
00:46:35,491 --> 00:46:39,990
special, so credible in his sixties right.

828
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,430
And he was, or was, it was an older, yeah,

829
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:48,540
and he's writing a whole new
special and performing every year.

830
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,770
It gave me 20 bucks.
I went to,

831
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,110
I went to the deli form
[inaudible] form and I get,

832
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:54,360
you're getting a ton of books.
I was like, oh, it's on a
house. He goes, yeah, I know.

833
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,460
And I was like,
thank you so much.

834
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,340
You can get 20 bucks from George
Carlin's should a frame that shit.

835
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:01,260
And I think I needed it.
That's,

836
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,570
I mean that's so courageous
to that he would do that.

837
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:06,990
That he would go out there
at 20 bucks. No, whatever.

838
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,770
You try out all the new shit bomb
when he could just pull out, you know,

839
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:14,250
hours of classes. He said that
his workout, he would be like,

840
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,300
I'm not doing the old stuff. Don't, don't
ask for it. I'm not going to do it. Yeah,

841
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,990
here we go. Yeah. That's how he had to
do it. Amazing. It's amazing. Really.

842
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,660
It's hard to put yourself in that
position, but if you do it enough,

843
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,790
practice enough, probably just
the same thing as working out.

844
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,070
You get to a place with like happier
that you just rely on the old

845
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,850
material and you actually just
went through the new stuff. Yeah.

846
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:36,070
But there's also Gaffigan and I talked
about this and one of the things that he

847
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:39,140
said was that you gotta have
both. He goes, I, he goes, I'm,

848
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,130
it's really important to me to be
really good to have a good show.

849
00:47:42,131 --> 00:47:43,420
These people are paying a lot of money.
I'm,

850
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,030
I can't just work out in front of
them. And I was like, you're right.

851
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:50,440
I feel the same way. Like I want
to, I sandwich new jokes in between.

852
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:53,530
Well that's already known and killers.

853
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:57,130
That's why I love workout sets at
the store in New York or anywhere.

854
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,400
It's just like, this is just, you
know, it's a fucking Tuesday night.

855
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,250
I want to hear to see anybody.
Don't you think that, you know,

856
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,170
you got to like get there.

857
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:10,171
The audience is sort of a respect
before you like start doing new shit.

858
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,760
I feel like here's what I'll do.
I know what you mean.

859
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,460
It's like you want to open her, it's
going to get up right away. Opener.

860
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:17,440
That works for sure.
And find a new one.

861
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:20,200
I'll find a new one for
this year by not having one.

862
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,900
That'll make me find a new one.
That's a good way to look at it.

863
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,580
But not having a closer that'll force
me to get a closer. But if I do my eh,

864
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:29,320
whatever and ending and then like,
let me hit you with some great bid,

865
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:31,480
I know works, then I don't
leave with that feeling of like,

866
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,810
I need something better there. Did
you, uh, get bummed out if people, uh,

867
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:40,770
send you like shitty messages about your
show on Twitter? No. Thought you sucked.

868
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,640
Because rarely is it super bad.

869
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,150
I'm trying my best with whatever that
new materialists and then it gets better

870
00:48:46,151 --> 00:48:47,710
and better.
So the more and more of it goes,

871
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:50,590
well maybe then eventually all
you need is just that closer.

872
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:54,850
But the first 10 is great, you know,
and then it becomes like, so, so yeah,

873
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:58,180
we've got to do some things, man. Let's
go to Alaska or something like that.

874
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:00,860
We've got some shit. Your
manager, and I told him, I'd say,

875
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:04,660
he's going to forget again. So just
Lo, I'm telling you, just look into it.

876
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,790
The longest day of the year she'll press
is Jay as a July 21st to the 23rd. Oh,

877
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,890
can you get shrooms in Alaska?
Fuck.

878
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:14,650
Of course you can write this the
way he says that. Of course you can.

879
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,210
There's no way that can't be true.

880
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,280
This is the guy who got almost were
arrested at the mall of America. You,

881
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,310
what do you mean to say?

882
00:49:21,311 --> 00:49:24,580
Is this the guy who got led off
by the cops have mall of America?

883
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,370
That's one way of playing
it. But you did get, I don't,

884
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,670
I can't remember the last time the cops
came at mall of America to talk to me.

885
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:35,900
Yeah,
I'm walking the line better.

886
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,340
Ooh. Did you ride the roller
coaster at the mall of America?

887
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:47,090
I didn't. It looks Janky and
old. It's like it's like done.

888
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,870
Everything's from like 22 on the side.
The inside rollercoaster.

889
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:53,140
They have a water ride
to the mall of America.

890
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:57,580
The biggest mall Edmonton Mall in America.
Edmonton Maltsberger in Canada.

891
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,330
Wow. Yeah. That's the biggest
wall in the world. I think so.

892
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:03,430
Have the by the top people though.
How does like Dubai,

893
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,610
how they tolerate the fact
that we have the biggest mall?

894
00:50:05,611 --> 00:50:07,330
They must be going crazy.
It's a really,

895
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,990
people driving their cars and
in Dubai like have you seen,

896
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,500
have you seen those photos of just like
Mercedes driving by with a big like lion

897
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,480
arm hanging out?
I haven't seen it.

898
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,870
There's a new show called
the Shahs of sunset.

899
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,190
All Iranian sell the
Persia here? Yeah. Okay.

900
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,330
Can I just say this and you could
disagree with me if you want.

901
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,410
You can put this on the record. I've
got the worst of the whites. Wow.

902
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,250
Persons and our mediums. You
are the Julius Jew of all
types. The way you said it.

903
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:41,730
The worst. The worst of the whites of all
the ways by Paul said that though you,

904
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:45,790
you, you so like made a Jewy face. God,

905
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,990
I'm becoming an old man. Oh Man. Set
in his ways. I worry about that man.

906
00:50:50,991 --> 00:50:53,930
I say something like, like someone
will say something. I'm like, why?

907
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,020
What are you saying? I'm like,
what am I god, I'm an old
Guinea. Yeah. Listen to me.

908
00:50:57,021 --> 00:51:00,140
I'm some fucking some old Guinea me.
What?

909
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:03,980
I was supposed to become the
worst of the worst of the light.

910
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,040
I'll tell you, dad.
Dot. Wurster the whites.

911
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,200
They were fine. They were
having a good time. I mean,

912
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:15,470
they seem like they were
enthusiastic people. Oh, this
you got think about. Yeah,

913
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,670
there's the show.
They're starting,

914
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:20,000
their dad's daddy lacks in the fucking
functional working so store that was

915
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:21,560
handed down to them.
I am listening.

916
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:24,230
I am all for anybody coming
from somewhere that sucks.

917
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:27,750
Like I ran and coming to America and
guess what? They're going to have some,

918
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,060
some fucking growing pains. They're
going to have to, I mean, it's not okay.

919
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:33,800
It's a completely suppress culture.

920
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:38,540
It's the ones that act overly that both
people are falling for the first time

921
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,170
ever. And like, you know, six generations.
You know what I mean? Think about that.

922
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,060
They come to America over
the last, I mean, look, the,

923
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:49,280
the whole hostage crisis shit happened
in the Carter administration and then

924
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:50,750
they stopped calling themselves Iranians,

925
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:52,360
cause I ain't a Iranian
girlfriend when I was,

926
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,950
she was Iranian then she was Iranian and
then they changed the person and they

927
00:51:54,951 --> 00:51:55,970
change it to Persian.
Why?

928
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,270
Because it got a bad rep fucking nobody
wanted anything to do with Iran. Man.

929
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:02,540
You don't, you don't know what it was
like at that point. Like when I was,

930
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:05,000
when she was my girlfriend, this is
what, like my first girlfriend ever.

931
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:08,360
I was like 11 years old and she was this
girl across the street and I'm fucking

932
00:52:08,361 --> 00:52:12,560
mother. The mother was Iranian, she
was half Iranian and half American.

933
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:16,880
And the mother tried to stab the
father with a knife while I was there.

934
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:19,640
The cops got there. It was
like, it's really crazy.

935
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:22,760
It was a crazy little situation.
She was a really nice girl.

936
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:25,370
But like they were in like deep turmoil.
Like her,

937
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,610
her family was in detail and
trying to get out. No, no.

938
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:33,290
I mean like the mother tried to kill the
fucking father with a knife. What? Yeah,

939
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,330
yeah. They got arrested while we were
there. It was really crazy. But, um, the,

940
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:42,020
um, my point was like, I got to see like,

941
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,500
you know what it's like in
their eyes to have escaped.

942
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,120
I ran and I ran was, you
know, it's, it's, it's,

943
00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:52,020
it's a fucking Dick dictatorship. I
don't give a shit what anybody says. The,

944
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,740
all those voting's and
it's nonsense over there.

945
00:52:54,741 --> 00:52:58,820
There's a reason why everybody erupted
and went fucking crazy after the last

946
00:52:58,821 --> 00:53:02,430
election. There's no real democracy
going on. And I ran. That's great.

947
00:53:02,431 --> 00:53:06,320
Hunting anytime soon, but oh no,
there's not. It's a scary place.

948
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:08,770
Excuse your behavior when you come
into a comedy club late at night.

949
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,270
I don't know why this place.
Yeah, you know what it is, man.

950
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,320
They're just like the guineas of the
fucking 1930s it's the same thing.

951
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,890
It's so those are the stuck. Most of
the word. Listen, that's my people.

952
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,750
I'm a Jersey Guinea. I was born in
Newark, New Jersey. Man. You know, that's,

953
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,520
that's the, that's the
environment. They're escaping

954
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,890
something that's sucks bad,
you know,

955
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,370
and so it takes him awhile to assimilate
to the greatest culture the world's

956
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:37,260
ever known. Hello. Welcome to
cafe. It was one time before you,

957
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,540
there's like 5% guys came
into the store late at night.

958
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:42,720
I would sit in the back row there and
run as AC is working the cover booth.

959
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,840
He was smoking a cigarette in the back
row. It was like one 30 in the morning,

960
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,330
but the Jim Painter,

961
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,480
the door guy was on stage and these
guys come in and smoking a cigarette and

962
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:54,840
we're like, hey guys, you can't, uh,
Steve said, guys, it's $20 cover.

963
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:57,360
And they're like, oh, okay. And they
sat there for him and he goes, guys,

964
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,430
it's $20 cover and you can't smoke
in here. You're going to go out.

965
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,810
And they kind of get this look of like,
alright.

966
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,510
And they walked towards the steps,

967
00:54:03,511 --> 00:54:08,070
waited there for like two minutes and
I just go get the fuck out you filthy

968
00:54:08,071 --> 00:54:11,880
Persians. Oh. And they
just started rushing at me.

969
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:15,450
Steve is holding back their kicks.
They were trying to spit at me a kick.

970
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:18,060
I'm trying to be cool and just sit there
and their kicks. We're just missing me.

971
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:23,310
Oh my God, I'm so mad at them. I was
like, get the fuck you're so rich.

972
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:26,760
You've done nothing. You're all
19. Get the fuck out of here.

973
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:29,830
So where are they getting their money
from? Others. What does, what does Dan do?

974
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:32,950
That worked hard because he overcame
that shit you were talking about. Ah,

975
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:34,500
all they did was inherit them.

976
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:38,280
This is a problem with a really rich kids.

977
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:40,020
You know like parents like you little bro.

978
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:42,430
A lot of parents are rich kids are
not taking care of those kids. Yeah.

979
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,050
Well don't children were black.
I'm working a lot too.

980
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,560
They'll let them wear black on black.
It's like you're a Douche.

981
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:51,930
Stop looking at your sweater.
Oh yeah. No, this is cool.

982
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,670
You have the gay flag sweater. Yeah.
He sitting on some picture pages.

983
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,040
How could you possibly ask me to
tell them what they're the worst?

984
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,750
They'll worst. What colors
to wear though? What?

985
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,170
It's were black on black now
with three buttons on done.

986
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:09,030
They're really nice people
and they were black on black.

987
00:55:09,031 --> 00:55:11,490
They would never act like that.
I won't have

988
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,150
you waited for your wife to
yell at you in the back of it.

989
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,490
You're shy in.
My Dad would never tolerate though.

990
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,140
You're going off.

991
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:31,720
Oh my God, you're so hilarious.
It comes out of him. He said,

992
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,840
I just visited my parents. Maybe that's
all. Maybe if you were a Persian,

993
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,930
you could get away with
saying that. No. Why?

994
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,250
That's going to have
some person's mad at you.

995
00:55:39,251 --> 00:55:41,380
They're going to come to the
show and be less Persian. He,

996
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,570
it's only the ones, you know
what I'm talking about. I
do because, because again,

997
00:55:47,571 --> 00:55:49,730
in your defense, I am McGinney. I'm a Tom,

998
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:54,080
mostly Italian and I don't like most
Italians. There's a lot on say like, oh,

999
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,320
you're Italian. Oh, you're
a person. You're fine. Yeah.
It was a lot of my life,

1000
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,530
but there's just this giant club. I
wouldn't even say it's most, I don't like,

1001
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,310
I would say it's 30% Renault, like the
Milton Palestinians, 30% Douche bags.

1002
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:07,430
So they ruin it for everyone.
That's all you think of. Exactly.

1003
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,940
And all these goddamn mob movies,
which just pumped those fuck heads up.

1004
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:14,600
It was really dumbed. Fuck titles
them. Do you know who I am?

1005
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,300
I'll come back there. I know people
kill yourself. I know people. Oh,

1006
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,070
that's horrible.
We stop

1007
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:28,660
it. Get rid of the loan. Let's do this.
Yeah. I wonder how much, um, you know,

1008
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:33,280
they say that the big mob in this country
is the Soviet mob and that they know

1009
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:37,140
how to keep their mouth
shut. Cause the Terry, yeah,

1010
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,480
they don't walk around with fucking
giant diamond rings on and they were like

1011
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:44,200
very sophisticated and there
are forms of organized crime.

1012
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,070
They're the most dangerous because
they're like the computer dude's Oh yeah.

1013
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:52,970
And the ruthless like, you know, that's
how that's a cold world man. You know?

1014
00:56:52,971 --> 00:56:56,560
Then those people went through a lot of
shit that we can't even begin to fathom.

1015
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:01,600
These guys are like, yeah, I pinky off. I
won't even blink. When we were in Japan,

1016
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:04,840
I didn't see any pinkies cut off to
gym now. And everyone wore a black,

1017
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:09,130
a lot of wearing black. Would you yell
at the Japanese? No. Black on black.

1018
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:13,550
On black on black pants and a black
guy.

1019
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:17,440
Black pants and a black shirt. NFC. See
what is wrong with that? First of all,

1020
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:20,520
if you're worn out. Yeah. It's a
little douchey. Black on black,

1021
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:23,320
you know my friend Bud, that's
all he wears. Black on black.

1022
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:28,190
His whole fucking wardrobe is black,
black button down. He has black jeans,

1023
00:57:28,191 --> 00:57:32,590
probably a black tee shirt and
black jeans, black sneakers.

1024
00:57:32,591 --> 00:57:36,120
This motherfucker has black.
Everything is black car. He's his.

1025
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:39,640
His whole thing is that he only wears
black. I want you to tell about something.

1026
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,690
If he does that, because I know what
he's going forward. This is all right.

1027
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,330
If he splashes a little bit of
color in there, it would really pop.

1028
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:51,820
Maybe some colorful shoes or some
socks. A, you would never get your car.

1029
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,540
Get my car murdered.
What do you mean they got all blacked out?

1030
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:00,460
That's murdered is the matte black
matte. Oh yeah, call it that. Cool.

1031
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:06,000
Matt. He has Matt Gray. Really
bad ass. I was like, damn,

1032
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:08,430
maybe we should do my car on my gt three.
Get it man.

1033
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,180
That paint your house that way.

1034
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:15,820
Like Madam Merrill's house. Damn.
You rolling dirty over there?

1035
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,200
What are you talking about
it? What does that mean? Oh,

1036
00:58:18,201 --> 00:58:21,130
that's what they'd would say about your
house. You'd be like, yeah, we're rolling.

1037
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:25,690
Go. Do you think you think
we're not rolling dirty?

1038
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,620
It's weird though, like not shiny is like
in now. People got tired of training.

1039
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:35,320
He's crows. That's why I don't
wash my car. Really? I like shiny.

1040
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,160
I like shiny.

1041
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:39,580
You know there's certain cars that look
like space ships to me when they're

1042
00:58:39,581 --> 00:58:44,440
shiny. I mean like I saw a
Ferrari yesterday. It was
one of these new four, five,

1043
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:47,310
eight Italians.
They look like,

1044
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,980
like it's like something from Battlestar
Galactica. He's got these crazy,

1045
00:58:50,981 --> 00:58:55,981
I lights down the sides like
$300,000 that's about the time.

1046
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:00,660
It's a house. It's transportation, but
it's not do it. It's not. It is not.

1047
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:02,980
It's a Goddamn ride.
Everywhere you go.

1048
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:08,190
It's a wild screaming ride that
men makes the most marvelous noise.

1049
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,230
It was Italian since they have this
fucking giant engine. It's been amazing.

1050
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:15,370
It's the good part of
Italians and it's like, yeah,

1051
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:17,650
but I'm sure it breaks down like crazy.

1052
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:22,190
My people are not to be trusted
like meticulous. Some things,

1053
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,230
they're not good at that.
They're good to the passion.

1054
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:27,890
Did they go to the crazy thing and
impulsive stuff, but it has this noise.

1055
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:30,030
It's kind of drove by and was like,
Whoa,

1056
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:36,650
it's like this wild animal noise,
man. It's just such a beautiful,

1057
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:41,330
like passionate noise, but $300,000
and it looks like a spaceship.

1058
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,200
You know, like the cars they're coming
out with today, they, they're, they're,

1059
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:47,990
they're slowly starting to look like what
we thought cars would look like in the

1060
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:50,240
future, you know, for a while
they'd be like, you know,

1061
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:53,120
at Ford Festiva what the fuck is
this? This is not space. This is not,

1062
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,240
this is not interesting.

1063
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:57,560
And this is just some shit shitty looking
box that you've created. You know,

1064
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:01,890
the older, older cars and
older, uh, Toyota's and share
bad as mustangs for awhile.

1065
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,650
A lot of terrible shapes,
man.

1066
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,430
But now they're finally
figuring out a way to like,

1067
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,420
make cars look everything except like,
you should look into hybrids.

1068
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:15,140
Yeah. There's still look like
shit. Except those Fiskars.

1069
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:19,550
Have you seen the fiscal Fiskars a die
believe it's a Dutch company and they've

1070
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:22,040
created the first a,
I think they're electrically,

1071
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,700
I think one of them may be a hybrid
and one of them is all fully electric,

1072
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:29,490
but they're really cool shapes.
They're really wild looking one,

1073
01:00:29,491 --> 01:00:33,680
they have like a sports car version of
it and have like a big like bad ass a Dan

1074
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:34,011
version.

1075
01:00:34,011 --> 01:00:37,310
It looks like a almost like a Maserati
or just wait until they get it to about

1076
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:41,480
300 or 400 miles per hour rate.
Miles branch once I get that. Yeah,

1077
01:00:41,481 --> 01:00:42,320
they're not quite there yet,

1078
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:46,400
but the real issue with DME is with these
electric cars, it's conflict minerals.

1079
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:48,760
The real issue is there's
only a limited amount. Well,

1080
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:52,010
lithium ion is what you need
to make those batteries.

1081
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:55,220
There's not a lot of that shit around
and you've got to get it in from places

1082
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:57,720
where people work for
slavery. Really? Yeah.

1083
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,700
Most of it's coming from the Congo and
isn't that what's in batteries and like

1084
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:03,980
regular batteries? Lithium
Ion, yeah, laptops, everything.

1085
01:01:03,981 --> 01:01:08,610
The conflict minerals or
one of the biggest crisis
conflict chargeable. No, the,

1086
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:13,550
the, the idea is they come
from Afghanistan, they come
from Congo places. Yeah,

1087
01:01:13,551 --> 01:01:17,450
exactly. Like blood diamonds. Yeah. Well
what, what, what people don't realize,

1088
01:01:17,451 --> 01:01:20,690
you know, when you think about,
like you think about a laptop,

1089
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,770
there's a gene of things that has to
happen and be put in place in order to

1090
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:29,210
create this laptop and had the very
end of the chain is going to be crazy.

1091
01:01:29,211 --> 01:01:30,800
It's going to be harder for
you to wrap your head around.

1092
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,360
But the very end of the chain,

1093
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:37,780
the very end is a kid in Africa
sticking a metal rod into the ground and

1094
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:42,030
chipping away rocks. Like
literally they're mining. Really?

1095
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,970
That's what they're doing.
Yeah. They're the little kids.

1096
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,990
[inaudible] that's some of it's
cold tran for cell phones. Oh,

1097
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:52,500
that's so sad to think about. Are we all
just say we'll put up with that? Well, no,

1098
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,220
on our stuff, people are trying
to uh, do things about that.

1099
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:58,640
But first of all to go into the
Congo is very fucking dangerous.

1100
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:02,240
Nobody wants to do that. And you
know, you want to go into Afghanistan,

1101
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:04,040
Jesus Christ.
That's fucking dangerous too.

1102
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:08,810
So it's like you only have
so many different ways of
dealing with the situation

1103
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:11,960
and obviously someone's in control
over these minerals. I don't know.

1104
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,290
I don't know what companies
they are specifically,

1105
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:18,110
but I know those companies must be
making ungodly amount of money. I mean,

1106
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:18,944
there's something,
there's,

1107
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:23,850
they estimated that there's more than
$1 trillion in unfound minerals in

1108
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,990
Afghanistan. They have discovered
over a trillion in the mountains.

1109
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,730
So they've known about this chip away
at the mountains. I don't know. It's,

1110
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,710
we'll do, you know, once
they start extracting it,

1111
01:02:34,711 --> 01:02:37,350
then it becomes a big issue of
like who's getting this money?

1112
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,400
Who's in control of the situation? Who's
in control of this, this piece of land?

1113
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:44,340
It's, it's a, it's a huge,
well, not really. No.

1114
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:49,410
I mean it's a huge factor and the reason
why we're over there and are in, uh,

1115
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:52,290
Afghanistan, the first place
economically, that place is worth,

1116
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:56,340
if the future is in technology and we're,
we're pretty sure it is.

1117
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:59,130
It's not like technology is going to stop.

1118
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:01,920
It's not like we're going to stop evolving
it and we're going to need minerals.

1119
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:05,820
We're going to need these
conflict minerals that are
that. Yeah, it's a big issue.

1120
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,340
What do you think of that guy? Shot up?
Pick one reason is doing well, that guy,

1121
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:13,970
I read a whole story about him. If you
don't know who he is, he killed, uh,

1122
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:19,010
I think it was 14 people and be 16, nine,
nine, nine. Nine of them were children.

1123
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,110
Their homes. Yeah. Went
into their homes, just gun.

1124
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:28,250
He was a soldier and he was a soldier
that quit his job in 2001 and signed up

1125
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:33,470
for the army after September 11th.
Really? And they felt, Catherine, what,

1126
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,930
you don't want to go on this last exactly.
Did it for all the right reasons,

1127
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,211
you know,

1128
01:03:37,211 --> 01:03:41,760
did it because he wanted to protect
his country and defend his country and

1129
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:46,140
thought, you know, this is my time to
step up and a and contribute to America.

1130
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,530
And by all accounts, for the longest
time, it was like the greatest guy.

1131
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:53,630
He was the life of the party. But he
started after his first couple of tours,

1132
01:03:53,631 --> 01:03:57,300
we went to Iraq, had been shot
in Iraq. Um, and then, uh,

1133
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,510
he did not want to go to Afghanistan,

1134
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,190
thought he was going to get a promotion
and he started thought it was going to

1135
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:04,710
get a better job back home
and be able to come back home.

1136
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:08,340
And he was denied that and he knew that

1137
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:14,190
his family is back home. He has
two kids and his, um, his house,

1138
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:17,340
apparently they had to put it up for
sale and the people that went to look at

1139
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:21,210
his house, it was in complete disarray. He
was becoming an alcoholic. He was, yeah.

1140
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:25,650
But look to man that the fucking pressure
of what these guys go through to ask

1141
01:04:25,651 --> 01:04:27,450
anyone to do it ever is crazy.

1142
01:04:27,451 --> 01:04:30,570
To ask anyone to repeatedly do it over
and over again when they don't want to do

1143
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:35,100
it anymore. It was nuts. I mean this guy
was up until a certain point in time,

1144
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:37,320
a hero and then he became a monster.
Yeah.

1145
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,900
The weird thing is people are
sort of like sick sickness.

1146
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,490
Like what are we doing with these guys?

1147
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:45,210
And it almost seems as if
we're like apologizing for
his behavior and it's like,

1148
01:04:45,211 --> 01:04:47,610
no, what he did was
completely wrong and horrible.

1149
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:50,800
But let's also examine what puts
a guy in this position. Yeah,

1150
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:54,480
it's like a little bit, you're,
you're totally right. It's so complex.

1151
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:58,260
I don't remember. The kid's like, you
fucking piece of shit. You should die.

1152
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,290
And he became a piece of shit and he
should die. But how did he become,

1153
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:02,970
we trained at a Taco.

1154
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:07,950
It's horrible that that guy became a piece
of shit and it's horrible that he was

1155
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,550
forced into this terrible,
terrible, unspeakable,

1156
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:15,930
unthinkable situation where I've seen
people die. He watched a good friend,

1157
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,890
got his leg blown off that day.

1158
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:18,841
Yeah.
He,

1159
01:05:18,841 --> 01:05:23,500
he had watched the guy get his leg blown
off that day and then went trunk and

1160
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:28,330
went on a rampage. That's when he lost
his shit. He, you know, the guy was,

1161
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:29,710
he was in trouble,
you know.

1162
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:32,500
And what they're saying is
how they not recognize this,

1163
01:05:32,501 --> 01:05:35,680
I think because everybody said trouble
over there. They're all in war.

1164
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:39,070
Suicides are up there though.
Like 80%. It's crazy. More.

1165
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,070
Some more soldiers have died.
It at one point in time,

1166
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,000
I don't know if it's still the case,

1167
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:47,650
but more soldiers had died from suicide
than had died from combat over there.

1168
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:52,540
Yeah, no, it was in one point in time.
It was suicides and Co. Let me, let me,

1169
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:56,160
it was at least in Afghanistan
at was, so that can't be true. I,

1170
01:05:56,161 --> 01:05:59,920
it sounds like it wouldn't be right.
Yeah. I better not have made that up.

1171
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:04,450
So how do I put phrases,
suicides,

1172
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:09,940
suicides, conflict, go for meadow, garden

1173
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:16,450
casualties. I will like that.
That would shock me. Yeah.

1174
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:17,740
It's a way to find out.

1175
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:22,390
Suicide claims more US military
lives than Afghan war. Yup.

1176
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:26,410
Like claims or they've killed more,
more soldiers.

1177
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:29,740
American military personnel are
continuing to take their own lives in

1178
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:33,880
unprecedented numbers as the war in
Afghanistan and that rack drag on by his

1179
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:34,720
late November,

1180
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:39,550
at least 334 members of the armed forces
had committed suicide in 2009 and more

1181
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:44,100
than 319 who were also killed
in Afghanistan or more,

1182
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:48,490
more than the 319 who were killed in
Afghanistan or the 150 who died in Iraq.

1183
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,330
Wow. Yeah, but it doesn't
matter. That was at what point?

1184
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,820
This is 2000 warheads more had died.

1185
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:59,950
Morehead died by suicide or had no one
had done more soldiers killed themselves

1186
01:07:00,071 --> 01:07:04,180
then were killed in combat.
Yes. Wow. Two years in a row.

1187
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:07,750
But that includes like American soldiers
and stuff like still still over here.

1188
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:12,160
It's all American soldiers. Not I'm saying
still people over here or is that Oh,

1189
01:07:12,161 --> 01:07:15,310
people over there that were committing
suicide. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1190
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,470
Cause it soldiers all Hawaii's period.

1191
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:22,660
It just says American military
personnel that might be a little longer,

1192
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,990
but there's still a the over there,
man. I think a lot of them have the,

1193
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,830
they have the same styles when they come
back here and go somewhere or if done

1194
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:34,180
post. Yeah, the traumatic stress
on many. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I was,

1195
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:38,470
I was hoping, I didn't
know. That's crazy. Wow.

1196
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:43,990
We listened to this before.
2001 the army rarely suffered.

1197
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:47,320
10 suicides per 100,000 soldiers.

1198
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:51,760
Now the army suicide
rate is 20 per 100,000.

1199
01:07:52,090 --> 01:07:56,200
It's higher than the registered
among males. Eight 19 and
29 gender, age bracket.

1200
01:07:56,530 --> 01:08:00,910
The highest rate amongst the
general population. Wow. So
look man, it's obviously,

1201
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:05,520
it's fucking terrible over there. And
why? Why is it terrible over there? Oh,

1202
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:08,510
there you go, man. Talking
about, shoot, you don't know.

1203
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:13,540
We'll lose full gum trees.
The birds country and the world.

1204
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:16,100
I don't know. I don't know. I don't

1205
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:18,920
know. I'm asking you. I know what
I read. So what's the problem?

1206
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:22,400
What I read is someone's
doing something really bad.

1207
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:27,050
Why did you see the video
of the first person shooter?

1208
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:30,920
A helmet cam firefight.
Pull that up. It's crazy.

1209
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,160
Hell yeah.
Helmet Cam firefight.

1210
01:08:35,270 --> 01:08:39,800
They have a video of a dude in
Afghanistan. Oh. And by the way,

1211
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:43,400
I got a message from a guy
on Twitter saying that, uh,

1212
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,840
that him and his boys who are over there
in the military in Afghanistan listen

1213
01:08:47,841 --> 01:08:50,990
to show all the time. So I want
to say if you're over there, man,

1214
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:54,680
stay safe and get them out of there.
Don't kill yourself.

1215
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,690
Get the fuck out of there as quickly
as you can and, uh, you know, Godspeed.

1216
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:02,540
And if you do get home and you
got some shit fucking with you,

1217
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,780
apparently they've been doing a lot of
studies on post traumatic stress disorder,

1218
01:09:05,781 --> 01:09:07,970
an MDM ey.
So look into that.

1219
01:09:08,330 --> 01:09:11,000
Look into if you have post
traumatic stress disorder,

1220
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,940
there's a lot of studies now
they're suggesting that you can,

1221
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:17,480
you can get over it much
more effectively with Mtma,

1222
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:21,320
which is ecstasy, ecstasy, or
the street name for it. Yeah.

1223
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:22,710
There's a lot of people that are,
um,

1224
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,340
taking ecstasy and they were
administering it to, uh,

1225
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,780
soldiers coming back from it. They're
upbeat. Yeah. Wow. Well, you know,

1226
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,930
it gives you such a loving feeling that
you can abandon all these terrible,

1227
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:34,850
definitely like if you're
having those feelings,

1228
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,820
go seek a therapist because your mind is
sort of messed up a little three and I

1229
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:41,820
pick up those thoughts you got up.
Like let me just do this. Yeah.

1230
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,140
And you gotta be real careful about uh,
traumatic brain injuries. You know what,

1231
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:48,380
what a lot of this was another
thing that happened to this guy.

1232
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:51,860
He had a traumatic brain injury,
a truck, a truck accident.

1233
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:54,990
The truck flipped and uh, he had a um, uh,

1234
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,580
a significant enough injury that they
called it a traumatic brain injury.

1235
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:03,620
I don't know the extent of it, but I do
know from dealing with fighters, suicide,

1236
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:08,210
no, this is the guy that killed everybody.
Oh, okay. It fucks with your judgment,

1237
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:09,500
unquestionably.

1238
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:14,501
It fucks with your judgment and your
ability can be in as little as a couple

1239
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:18,710
like hard concussions
you just in your life.

1240
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:23,711
A couple can really deteriorate the
suicide that think that concussions can,

1241
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,890
can lead you to like unquestionably
brain failures if you don't put the relax

1242
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:28,431
after the well,

1243
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:31,970
especially these guys who have concussions
and then jump right back in the game

1244
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:35,960
and get multiple concussions and the
same day that happens after you shouldn't

1245
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:38,900
even listen to loud music or anything
that you shouldn't watch crazy TV.

1246
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,090
You just sit there and read
a book, do nothing. Yeah,

1247
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:43,760
you have to heal up your fucking
brain man. And there's not,

1248
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:47,060
there's not a whole lot of different
things that they can do to help you other

1249
01:10:47,061 --> 01:10:50,310
than time. And nootropics too. It's
one of the things they do. They give,

1250
01:10:50,540 --> 01:10:53,350
they give them a lot of
different nutrients. Like, um,

1251
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:58,310
Bill Roman [inaudible] has a whole outline
based on that. It's called neuro one.

1252
01:10:58,370 --> 01:11:01,350
And this was one of the first
new tropics I ever got into. Um,

1253
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,750
no name told us about it. Remember when
we were up in San Francisco? And Alison,

1254
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:07,670
Sarah, no name on the,
uh, Alice morning show,

1255
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,060
great radio show that it doesn't exist
anymore. They were awesome together.

1256
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:13,980
Or John, they split. But last time we did

1257
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,390
no names when we, when I make
him drink his purse. Yeah.

1258
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:22,440
Um, but my, my point was that he was
working out with this Roman Ascii guy.

1259
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:27,540
Roman house gets suffered a ton of
concussions. He's had many multiple,

1260
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,850
multiple concussions and he started,
uh,

1261
01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:35,350
looking into a different nutrients
that can within he'd his, uh, his,

1262
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,770
his brethren, his recovery, and he
created his own line called neuro one. Oh,

1263
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,320
that's cool. I used to take it all
the time before I played video games.

1264
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,720
I should take, yeah, I
take it all the time.

1265
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:48,180
That's one of the things that
may have said about Alpha brain.

1266
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:51,060
That's what may hand Miller said. Well,
that's why I knew Alpha brain is legit.

1267
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:54,870
Dude. He goes, I took it and
he goes, I was on fire when
I was playing video games.

1268
01:11:54,871 --> 01:11:59,100
I was fucking people up, you know.
But, uh, I take it before I play pool,

1269
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:03,030
I would take Roman Asca Shit. We're going
to ask you stuff. It tastes good too.

1270
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:06,870
It's um, and when we got caught taking
pictures with a BB John With who?

1271
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,350
We be Jones, who's BB Jones
Horn store. Really like,

1272
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,120
oh that was Grand Koski sorry. Chron.
Koski yeah, I thought there were about,

1273
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,970
I don't know what you're talking about.
Bill Romanowski is a different guy. Yeah,

1274
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:20,490
he's a,
he's a famous football player.

1275
01:12:20,540 --> 01:12:23,740
I think you said you got Kyle Clark
House cause I just got mixed up. Yeah,

1276
01:12:23,741 --> 01:12:24,880
I see what you're saying.
Yeah.

1277
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:29,930
Gronkowski Romanowski I hear you don't
like white people. It's like, yeah,

1278
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:33,600
you gotta have got the worst of the white
stallion. Tend not to do that anymore.

1279
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:37,940
Just tell them not to tell them not
to do black on black. On Black Bud.

1280
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,170
Yeah. No Bud never wears anything but
black and he won't listen to you. He's,

1281
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:45,180
he's a dangerous man. You don't
understand. He's the man in black.

1282
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:49,560
You don't get to cast it as a
black American Express card.

1283
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:53,160
I Shit you not because
he loves it that much.

1284
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:57,540
It drives a black Cadillac,
blacked out windows or has it gone?

1285
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,850
He's I'm Douche bag either. He's
a nice guy, believe it or not.

1286
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:04,080
And why did you have to do that?
He knows people who are in black ops.

1287
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:07,980
So what I told your life over it.
I Dunno.

1288
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:12,090
It's just a thing man. I Dunno.
Yeah, it's odd. He's an odd dude.

1289
01:13:12,091 --> 01:13:15,180
He just decided at one point in time to
wear all black and they never switched

1290
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:18,550
because some people don't like looking
silly man. They don't like looking silly.

1291
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,080
Too easy. Yeah. What is it that does
a specific type of black and white?

1292
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:25,410
It's come to you easy. I can't do it
all black all the time. That would be,

1293
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,140
it shows come too easy.

1294
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,790
What are you just coming
all over yourself?

1295
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:35,490
You know you come a little [inaudible]
it will definitely get on your pants or,

1296
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:38,880
that's a good point man.
I see what you're saying.

1297
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:45,750
Where a lot of white trying
to like hide come essentially.

1298
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,270
Have you ever, yeah, you've done it.
You think you're a bit about it. What?

1299
01:13:51,271 --> 01:13:54,030
Come on myself where you look down and
you're like, dude, this shirt Scott.

1300
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:59,010
So much come on it a bit about how it
would just wear that shirt outside the

1301
01:13:59,011 --> 01:14:01,920
house to door guys. It
happens a lot. Yeah.

1302
01:14:01,921 --> 01:14:03,270
If anybody would say what's on your shirt?

1303
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,160
I don't even fuck do
you think it is bitch?

1304
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:11,070
It's white and it's crusty and it's
right near my shop. It happens more.

1305
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,160
You like

1306
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,280
more than like,
I think most people are.

1307
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:17,110
I mean did you feel like it happens more
with you? Like I, I feel like I have.

1308
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:22,150
How often do you jerk it off? I'm out
and I see it more than that. I was like,

1309
01:14:22,180 --> 01:14:25,120
you had sex in like a shirt and everybody.
Do you have sex with your clothes on?

1310
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,910
No. No, but I definitely
once you take you to,

1311
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:29,650
you should definitely like it's at night.
I'm just like,

1312
01:14:29,651 --> 01:14:32,230
oh I gotta wipe this off and I grabbed a
shirt and then forget and then like two

1313
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:36,740
weeks later I pick what you pick up
teachers off the floor. Where though? No,

1314
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,660
they float in the air.

1315
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:46,020
Why would you put shoes on
the floor where? I don't know.

1316
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:49,720
See, I think she's one of them. I
think shirts have an hour life kind of.

1317
01:14:49,721 --> 01:14:52,630
I think somebody else talked about this
to me once and I totally agree with him

1318
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:57,190
for an hour throw right Jarvis right
jars. Oh, so like if I have a shirt,

1319
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:58,360
like I wear the shirt right now.

1320
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:01,840
If I take it off like in an hour or so
and put it on the floor or whatever,

1321
01:15:01,841 --> 01:15:04,270
I think I could still wear it again.
They've only one or two hours.

1322
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:08,410
I wore the same shirt Friday and Saturday
night. T shirt? Yes, but not really.

1323
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:12,660
It was a tee shirt over a flannel or
over a thermal morale though. Yeah.

1324
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:15,490
The reason I did it was because Saturday
night was Fitzsimmons Irish show and

1325
01:15:15,491 --> 01:15:18,040
I'm like, I got to wear
green. The green shirt,

1326
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:20,140
you're changed none of the tee shirt I,

1327
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:24,690
I kept on looking at more the thermal
underneath. So the t shirt. Oh no,

1328
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:29,320
that's okay. I just did it. [inaudible]
though. I only had one in a plus.

1329
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:30,990
It's a dope shirt.
Which one?

1330
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:35,710
It's a Brazilian Jujitsu with Gracie
academy and kind of be a degree. You have,

1331
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:39,910
you seen it like in Portuguese and with
that green sign on if the Brazil yeah,

1332
01:15:39,911 --> 01:15:43,210
yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like real
faded. It's this roots of fight line.

1333
01:15:43,211 --> 01:15:45,930
They have a whole line of like
you seen Eddie with that, um,

1334
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,610
the Bruce Lee Kung Fu
tshirt? I think so. Yeah.

1335
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:52,750
I always loved it because it was like
the name of Bruce Lee's first Kung Fu

1336
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:56,290
school that he had when he
came to America. Oh really?
Yeah, it's really bad ass.

1337
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,030
And, and so, uh, I uh,

1338
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,580
I went to their website and they
had a bunch of fucking cool shit.

1339
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:01,890
And so I bought this,
uh,

1340
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,900
this old school Gracie academy one
and then I got this one on right now.

1341
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:09,500
All the one I'm wearing right now.
So this was a Hixon versus uh,

1342
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:11,470
Kimora or excuse me,

1343
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:15,850
not Hixon Helio Hickson Hickson at the
main guy that the originator, excuse me,

1344
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,500
helio a versus a Kimora from 1951.
That's cool.

1345
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:24,380
Gear Gracie, close zero, zero. Yeah.

1346
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,140
You had some tap out shit you used to.

1347
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:29,480
Every now and then. And then I, when I,

1348
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:33,680
when I saw a homeless guy wearing a tap
out shirt might be too mainstream now.

1349
01:16:33,681 --> 01:16:37,110
I saw a homeless guy in the
Ed hardy shirt. Yeah. Yeah.

1350
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,130
Some old guy today cheer me on.
I went through a red light.

1351
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:43,010
They just did this great space coaster.
No,

1352
01:16:43,011 --> 01:16:46,970
I thought it was going to look like I'm
taking them out to another dimension I

1353
01:16:46,971 --> 01:16:49,040
was going to go through. It's like
yellow. I'm like, Nah, I'll just run this.

1354
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:51,460
When you wearing that sweater that
was wearing this way and he like,

1355
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,450
he starts doing this pump
and as I go through he goes,

1356
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:59,960
gets hit the fingers and I was
like, yeah man, here's your text.

1357
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,910
It makes you think that
they saw a homeless guys
probably could have been kind

1358
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:07,560
of cool in any other era. Maybe they
might not have been homeless, you know,

1359
01:17:07,561 --> 01:17:09,630
maybe if they grew up in
the 60s they would have

1360
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,790
skated through and actually
doing that are okay.

1361
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,620
It'd be a hundred percent homeless.

1362
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:18,830
There's a lot of people becoming homeless
now though. Man, this is a tricky time.

1363
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:21,660
Is it? There's more homeless
people now. I bet. Yeah.

1364
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,880
Well there's actually people that I know
that our homeless like comics and it

1365
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:29,240
kind of creeps me out. I don't want
to say like couch surfing. Yeah.

1366
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:30,290
That's not really homeless.

1367
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:35,570
Not having a house is a little and it
sucks when you have one of those guys that

1368
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:39,260
lives in your house, you'd never going
to get them out. It makes me sad,

1369
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:42,350
especially since a couple of them are
girls and was like, Oh you poor girls.

1370
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:47,720
[inaudible]
oh Brian getting dark on it.

1371
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:51,450
You put that up there on purpose
to hopefully go track cause that's,

1372
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:54,770
that's scary.
That's scary because this couch surfers,

1373
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:56,140
they must have stinky ass pussy.

1374
01:17:56,141 --> 01:17:58,610
It's don't you think because they probably
don't want to use the shower as much

1375
01:17:58,611 --> 01:18:00,760
cause they don't want to like get
him people's hair and there's,

1376
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:03,490
you know what I mean? They wake up
early and probably go out for the day.

1377
01:18:03,491 --> 01:18:06,030
You girls, you're talking.
Yeah. Yeah. People that couch.

1378
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,790
I've never had a couch surfer.

1379
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,400
I would just imagine that they would want
to leave and get out of your hair and

1380
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:12,990
not really buggy. Okay. So
someone was only crashing couch.

1381
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,960
They don't have a bedroom in your house.
You know,

1382
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,780
like I've only had people stay at my
house. Well I kind of had my friend John,

1383
01:18:17,781 --> 01:18:19,880
he stayed on my couch for a
little bit back in New York.

1384
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,610
But the most of the people that
have stayed with me, they had,

1385
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:25,280
they stayed in that extra room.
I was there for a week. Yeah.

1386
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:29,960
Dunkin and Tate lived here. Tate
lived here for months. But it's great.

1387
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,830
It's great to,
you know,

1388
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:34,580
if you have a friend who stayed with
you and it's only for a short period of

1389
01:18:34,581 --> 01:18:38,510
time, it's cool. You know? Like I loved
having both those guys here. It was fun.

1390
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:41,900
It was cool. You know, just
have a buddy, you come home,

1391
01:18:41,901 --> 01:18:44,510
your buddies watching TV at your house.
Well you have a good house for it.

1392
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:48,340
It's nice. It's segmented those
with me when it comes to town. Yeah.

1393
01:18:48,450 --> 01:18:53,330
He's a great guy. Smart. Like excited
about it. Yeah, it's fun. Yeah,

1394
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:56,850
it'd be quite a little bit. Bert and Tom
Segura except they have frame release.

1395
01:18:56,851 --> 01:18:57,684
You're fucked.
I know.

1396
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:02,530
Like they'd be the Mommy and the
mom and dad and you'd stay out.

1397
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:05,630
So mean, just live with them.
Live with them roommate,

1398
01:19:05,631 --> 01:19:09,320
if you could bring to a marriage, it's
up to make it happen. Get to go on.

1399
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:14,900
I have to do is break them up. They're
happily married and shit, but whatever.

1400
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,280
They don't even know what's best for them.

1401
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:19,190
I did a podcast with Christina because
it's going to, I thought I lost,

1402
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:21,860
I thought deleted it by accident
before he marked up. Oh,

1403
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:27,210
she's funny as fuck man. That's
Thompson girl, his wife for the, uh,

1404
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:30,680
did you guys kiss? We got an apartment. We
did not kiss. Did you ask her? Smell it.

1405
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:35,260
I did ask her to smell it.
So don't want to talk real
quick. No, no. My finger. Good.

1406
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,170
If you do, do you still do that
bit about the doctor, but uh,

1407
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:42,670
getting you checked out. Never made
it. It never made it, you know,

1408
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,130
that's why I need to record an album. I
forgot about that. I forgot about that.

1409
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:50,090
Are you, can I tell you, yeah, go for
our, we had this bit where he would, uh,

1410
01:19:50,350 --> 01:19:53,930
did you have, was she an attractive
woman? Doctor was an Asian doctor.

1411
01:19:53,931 --> 01:19:54,651
Attractive woman.

1412
01:19:54,651 --> 01:19:57,680
Doctor was looking at his dick because
he had like some sort of lesion on it.

1413
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:01,250
Something, yeah, something going on.

1414
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:05,540
And he just thought for a second about
grabbing the back of her head while she

1415
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:10,230
was down on our knees looking at us and
he, and then he goes like, oh, you like,

1416
01:20:10,231 --> 01:20:15,190
she would be like, oh,
finally a real man. I like,

1417
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:17,310
but I was like, I don't want to
cause you're going to be mad.

1418
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:21,590
But like what if she'd be into it?
We got the opportunity. The problem.

1419
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,750
That's what kept Clinton alive during
those fucking leg. The lower house. Yeah.

1420
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:31,590
Just whipping it out. Yeah. How many of
the presidents you think would like that?

1421
01:20:31,591 --> 01:20:35,550
You know, there's a, Oh, there's a
book coming out that says Nixon's gay.

1422
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,690
Not only is it gay, really did,
they'd name the guy he was gay with.

1423
01:20:39,691 --> 01:20:43,020
He had a longterm relationship
with this one man. And he,

1424
01:20:43,350 --> 01:20:47,400
he took it with this guy
with him everywhere. There's
a really cute Latino guy.

1425
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:50,190
He took the guy with them everywhere.
That's possible. I totally see that.

1426
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:51,650
She playing him.

1427
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:56,090
I barely remember when Liberace sort of
like it was like he's got aids or no, no,

1428
01:20:56,091 --> 01:20:59,730
no, not Liberace. That other guy rock
Hudson. Yeah, and people are like, what?

1429
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:02,250
That's how I remember it.
Was he super good beforehand?

1430
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:06,520
If he's just real handsome. It was a real
handsome movie star, like the, you know,

1431
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:09,390
the early days and I think
people just never believe no.

1432
01:21:09,420 --> 01:21:11,910
So there must be God's like that,
like an office to of course.

1433
01:21:11,911 --> 01:21:14,700
Just so you just don't want to think
about it because of the times. It's like,

1434
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:16,340
yeah,
they're pretty short nursing.

1435
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:19,350
This guy's pretty sure he's going
on a limb on this Nixon thing,

1436
01:21:19,351 --> 01:21:22,870
but George Washington got a lot of
photos of George Washington's leave that

1437
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,820
spread it,
spread it

1438
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:28,770
can shared a bed with a
man was common back then.

1439
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:32,010
The rusty trombone common,
now it's called homosexuality.

1440
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:37,290
They were cold as fuck in the Lincoln
was living in a fucking house made out of

1441
01:21:37,291 --> 01:21:40,740
sticks. No, that's right.
Built his own fucking house.

1442
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,110
Does that much with weather
proofing. Yeah. Well,

1443
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:45,360
if you had a lot to sleep at one
president, who would it be? Clinton.

1444
01:21:45,361 --> 01:21:47,880
I bet he knows how to slide deck.
That's good.

1445
01:21:48,690 --> 01:21:51,780
He might be willing to bring some girls
in the equation, you know? Listen man,

1446
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:54,180
you could fuck me, but can
we get some girls too? Shit.

1447
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:57,930
I was always attracted
growing up to Andrew Jackson
just because of his hair and

1448
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:02,460
yeah, on the $20 bill, it was kind of
cool. Well, Washington, Tony White teeth,

1449
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:06,790
like these crazy fake teeth.
What do they call it?

1450
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:11,140
Black and we'll have them cops. No, he
had dentures. Oh really? Yeah, they were,

1451
01:22:11,141 --> 01:22:13,670
you know, like one of the first early
dentures he had, you know, they,

1452
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,770
they didn't take care of their mouths
back then and the people's mouths,

1453
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:19,650
their teeth would run out of their fucking
head. They didn't know anything then.

1454
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:23,130
No, ain't no shit. If
you had appendicitis, you
would just die in bed dead.

1455
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:27,230
No one else in the list.
It comes on within a week.
You're dead. You're not. They,

1456
01:22:27,430 --> 01:22:29,570
you know, was witchcraft. Oh,

1457
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:32,490
all these people are allergic to peanuts
and all that, but with, you know,

1458
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:36,900
they just die off. Oh, to our, our art,

1459
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:41,030
our technologies overcome nature's way
of getting rid of those people. I mean,

1460
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,400
look, do the meek shall inherit the
earth. I mean that as a quote is,

1461
01:22:44,401 --> 01:22:48,780
it sounds silly. It sounds biblical, it
sounds like, oh yeah, sure they will,

1462
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,040
but what do you mean physically meek,
but mentally strong,

1463
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:54,330
physically weak,

1464
01:22:54,331 --> 01:22:58,740
but able to manifest all sorts of
incredible things out of technology.

1465
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,370
That's really what's going
on and in manifesting all
these incredible things out

1466
01:23:02,371 --> 01:23:06,490
of technology, they've, the
body has less, less requirements

1467
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,290
physically.
So they become meek,

1468
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,950
they become meek and their computers
and technology becomes strong and they

1469
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:14,410
inherit the there.
It's that simple.

1470
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:17,890
But that's really what's happening
and it's what's going to happen.

1471
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:19,720
And along the way,
they're going to figure it out.

1472
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:23,410
Cures to every fucking disease
as people are alive or,

1473
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:27,940
or the strong people would just start
bashing the fuck out of the smart people.

1474
01:23:27,941 --> 01:23:30,110
That's possible too.
That's possible too.

1475
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,930
But then eventually they
would breed smart people.

1476
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,740
We're going to have a middle state right
now because I wouldn't say it's the

1477
01:23:34,741 --> 01:23:36,550
smartest people controlling
the world right now.

1478
01:23:36,551 --> 01:23:40,030
It's just the comments as far as people
that ever been the smartest cunts.

1479
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:44,080
Oh yeah. But they're cuts the really
smart people like Bill Gates and you know,

1480
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:45,670
they're not really controlling the world.
I mean,

1481
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:48,850
they have a massive business
and everything like that,
but they're not directing,

1482
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:51,970
you know, overseas campaigns to
get these minerals and fuck off

1483
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:56,220
curing malaria. Yeah. Fucking
great things. Great things.

1484
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:59,080
Just donating billions of dollars.
It's an amazing how it,

1485
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:02,590
like Steve Jobs always got the
reputation as being like the cool guy.

1486
01:24:02,591 --> 01:24:05,590
He was like green and great for the
world. Meanwhile, Bill Gates was,

1487
01:24:05,591 --> 01:24:10,450
he got out there donating money for
schools and don't feel like he was crazy

1488
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:13,480
humanitarian shit. Malaria research
institute or whatever it's called.

1489
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:16,240
Go like we're done without him. As
soon as he stopped giving, we're out.

1490
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:21,280
It's amazing. Have you seen his house?
Oh No. The battle. What's it like?

1491
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:25,960
Ooh. Oh my God. What's it like?
There's a desire for it online.

1492
01:24:25,961 --> 01:24:29,260
It's fucking incredible.
It's built. First of all,

1493
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:33,760
he has a submarine.
That's what I said.

1494
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:39,120
He's got a door underneath his fucking
house where he can like open up and bring

1495
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:40,990
the fucking submarine.

1496
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,580
Sure.
It's just not crazy like it opens,

1497
01:24:43,581 --> 01:24:46,770
he can bring it in a bucket and
those old Nazi lab shows or whatever.

1498
01:24:46,771 --> 01:24:50,510
When they came in, hope I didn't make
the site. It's crazy. Yeah. I got a door.

1499
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:55,260
It's incredible.
State of the garage

1500
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,000
for submarine. Yeah. It's on
like a sad, it's not a sound,

1501
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:03,001
it's all like the ocean or something
like that and it's this amazing fucking

1502
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:04,114
house,

1503
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:08,680
like the top of the lung technology
in every room you walk in,

1504
01:25:08,681 --> 01:25:12,380
you wear a pendant and
the Pender gives your,

1505
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:15,970
your particular id out to
all these different sensors.

1506
01:25:16,090 --> 01:25:20,350
So as you enter a room,
your particular lighting comes on,

1507
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:25,300
10 was to your temperature, your
mood, your music starts playing.

1508
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:28,510
So wow, that's pretty cool.
That's what I'm saying.

1509
01:25:28,511 --> 01:25:31,640
So you leave one romantic
tailgates, his house. Oh

1510
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:34,600
yeah,

1511
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:38,510
you are such a case.

1512
01:25:38,511 --> 01:25:42,590
I was thinking about which President
Bill Gates is like that we were talking

1513
01:25:42,591 --> 01:25:44,730
about. I know, but I was
talking, I was thinking,

1514
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,540
I was still thinking about which
president did that happen. The Pot.

1515
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:49,790
Sometimes if I'm talking to somebody
and they'll be yapping in my mind we'll

1516
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:53,840
just go elsewhere and I'll be like,
hey, can you back up a second?

1517
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:57,200
I didn't hear any of it. I see.
I was thinking like JFK because,

1518
01:25:57,201 --> 01:26:00,440
but I don't know if it was just like the
Instagram colored look of all the film

1519
01:26:00,441 --> 01:26:02,060
that you see JFK and it's kind of cool.

1520
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,070
But I think I would see Lincoln
just for that cause that's

1521
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:05,690
of course meet with Lincoln.

1522
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:10,930
JFK would probably the most likely to fuck
you. Who was living in Korea you time.

1523
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:13,330
We're allowed to fuck any of them.
They want to care.

1524
01:26:13,331 --> 01:26:15,710
Apparently it was like the
biggest freak of all time.

1525
01:26:15,890 --> 01:26:20,840
I already had a couple thoughts down.
Physically fuck them. Fuck them. Fuck you.

1526
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:24,410
I thought, Oh, you got to fuck them.
Fuck them. Oh. Then Grover Cleveland,

1527
01:26:24,411 --> 01:26:28,570
one of those fat guys. I'm going to
fuck my Nigga Nixon, Nixon, Nixon.

1528
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:30,920
Well I tried to get the
secrets. Fuck them. Now.

1529
01:26:30,921 --> 01:26:32,090
Which one would you want to make love with

1530
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:38,690
a Lincoln freed the slaves and he probably
had already had experience with men.

1531
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,430
Right? Ra, what about you?

1532
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:46,200
I mean like we're trying to
last as long as we can. Right.

1533
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:51,120
What you made when you want to fuck you
and everyone will enjoy this moment.

1534
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:54,550
Going condom or no condom. We find
spread out. This is love, Bro.

1535
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,930
Love plus there were barely any ears
back then. There were letters, diseases,

1536
01:26:58,931 --> 01:27:03,140
but get a scrape yourself free if
you have something, what did you do?

1537
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:06,830
I don't know. You'd to reach up there
with the guides isn't it? Didn't uh,

1538
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,940
Al Capone, didn't he die?
Syphilis? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1539
01:27:10,941 --> 01:27:12,110
Syphilis would kill people.

1540
01:27:12,111 --> 01:27:16,080
If you ever seen like pictures of people
who have like really like a longterm,

1541
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:20,450
like advanced syphilis.
Horrible. Disgusting. Yeah.

1542
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:23,780
It's an evil disease. It's crazy. We
give each other diseases by fucking,

1543
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:27,380
it really is. It's like it just
attacks that area. Like a lot of them.

1544
01:27:27,381 --> 01:27:30,240
That's the only way to get it. You don't
get herpes by shaking hands, you know?

1545
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:34,430
But you can get it flew by shaking
hands, shook a hand. You've product code.

1546
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,530
You should [inaudible].

1547
01:27:37,930 --> 01:27:40,520
You actually touched a herpes
dick or her pedic peanuts.

1548
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:44,960
You be fine if you had a cut on your
finger. No, you don't hand herpes. Yeah,

1549
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:47,530
you're right. There's no hand
herb. You sure you can? No,

1550
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,570
you wouldn't get it in your hand.
Lipson Dick Lipson deck. It's weird.

1551
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:55,370
It has to be like an open, why would that
cause those areas, the genital herpes,

1552
01:27:55,371 --> 01:27:58,230
that's all over the place sometimes,
right? No, just in your genitals. Really.

1553
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:03,800
Just general like in your legs too and
there's actually in your eyeball. Yeah,

1554
01:28:03,801 --> 01:28:07,190
there's, there's a type of it and
got a forehead to shingles too,

1555
01:28:07,191 --> 01:28:11,190
which is like another, like an advance of
herpes. Yeah. It's different kinds of her

1556
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:16,580
thinking is shingles cordon
off. Yeah. They cook those.

1557
01:28:16,581 --> 01:28:18,620
But then you have that
juice inside you forever.

1558
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:23,220
You had fucking bomb bomb that Obama, I
think I just see Ra being wanting it. Oh,

1559
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:28,340
[inaudible] off my back so much.

1560
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:32,450
Did you see the video of the guy who
claimed that he was Obama's lover and that

1561
01:28:32,451 --> 01:28:36,950
they had shared oral sex and no
real, is he in Chicago? Yeah.

1562
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,710
You ever heard this guy?
Pull it up, pull it up.

1563
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:43,450
I could see Obama's gay
lover just pull up, uh,

1564
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:47,120
confessions. Obama's gay
or Gay Obama lover. Yeah.

1565
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:50,150
The guy was so ridiculous and
he's got a nice house. Does he?

1566
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:54,350
Confession of the Obamas
k lover? He was, uh,

1567
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:59,060
they were interviewing him about it and
he, uh, it's just so ridiculous. He's,

1568
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:02,400
yeah,
that's the guy is Larry Sinclair.

1569
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:04,600
You can have, first of all,
you got to see Obama instead.

1570
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:06,420
This is a giant Apatow movie.

1571
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,810
Springs Colorado to
Chicago on November 2nd,

1572
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:13,680
1999 arriving in our hair early
in the morning of November 3rd,

1573
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,510
I went to the Chicago area to
attend the graduation. Of My Godson,

1574
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:19,361
my best friends,

1575
01:29:19,361 --> 01:29:22,410
and from basic training from the
Great Lakes naval training facility.

1576
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:26,280
I made reservations at the
Comfort Inn and suites in Gurnee,

1577
01:29:26,310 --> 01:29:29,220
Illinois based solely on the
location to the training center.

1578
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:34,560
On November 5th, 1999 I hired the
services of Fivestar limousine,

1579
01:29:36,290 --> 01:29:38,600
Wiener, and guides me a lot of
details and this guy still hired,

1580
01:29:38,610 --> 01:29:41,130
hired them both for
November 5th or November 6th

1581
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:45,330
and November 6th,

1582
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,390
1999 I asked the limo driver whose name
I now really have for the first time,

1583
01:29:49,630 --> 01:29:51,930
Jack Pepper, me who? Connie.

1584
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:56,730
Anyone who would like to
socialize and show me Chicago.

1585
01:29:57,690 --> 01:30:00,720
Most of them are totally understood
that I was looking for someone who knew

1586
01:30:00,721 --> 01:30:02,640
Chicago and would enjoy socializing.

1587
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,660
Tiny said he knew someone
who was a friend of his

1588
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,060
on November six 1999 after picking
me up at the hotel and Gurney,

1589
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:16,680
and this is significant,
Mr he used his cell phone to make a call.

1590
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:20,160
That call was me to then Illinois
state Senator Barack Obama.

1591
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:23,850
Go set up an introduction
between myself and Senator Obama.

1592
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:28,180
So on a sailing at the bar and setting
the limits in it or is he claiming

1593
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,300
and I was just,

1594
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:36,010
can you just hit the space bar? It
doesn't work. Yeah. Um, well hold on.

1595
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:37,870
Yeah,
which has happened.

1596
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:41,510
The guy saying that he fucked up Obama
and so we gave all those details in order

1597
01:30:41,511 --> 01:30:43,510
to do like an idiot be
corroborative or like say like,

1598
01:30:43,511 --> 01:30:45,630
well you can give all those details
cause he's a moron. But yeah,

1599
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,680
it was such a long, it's part
of the storage. Hell Buddy.

1600
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:51,570
Well I'm also doing a press conference.
You have 20 minutes to kill you think so.

1601
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:55,850
This guy called this, he
got his limo driver to call.
Hey, show me some good. Okay,

1602
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:58,320
good. Dick and Obama was like, man, you,

1603
01:30:58,321 --> 01:31:00,910
you let me know when someone's looking
for Dick. Oh you tried to limo.

1604
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,330
And I'm a senator and I'm
thinking about being a president,

1605
01:31:04,331 --> 01:31:09,040
but if you see some of this, I don't
abandon all that shit. It just takes

1606
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:13,020
the guy's nuts.

1607
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:17,230
[inaudible] the guy he reeks of being
foolish and he's not just like we had a

1608
01:31:17,231 --> 01:31:20,320
relationship in college. It's like,
these are crazy. He's a random like,

1609
01:31:20,350 --> 01:31:24,090
call me up and I'll just fuck
somebody that's maybe, yeah. I mean,

1610
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:27,510
the story is so preposterous.
What if it was around,

1611
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,080
do you think he took a Abe Lincoln?

1612
01:31:29,081 --> 01:31:32,340
Was the vampire sounding lessons from the
Republican convention like us act like

1613
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:35,890
us? That's what everyone, Obama,
I don't believe that it's real,

1614
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:38,320
but I wouldn't be surprised
if it was real. Yeah,

1615
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:39,610
because look at what
happened with Clinton,

1616
01:31:39,730 --> 01:31:43,340
who would have ever believed that there
was a president and he was, you know,

1617
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,920
in his 50s and he was,
you know,

1618
01:31:44,921 --> 01:31:48,450
in the White House and he was
having a 20 year old girl, blonde.

1619
01:31:48,451 --> 01:31:53,170
They shooting loads on her dress and want
to believe that nobody poppers starts

1620
01:31:53,171 --> 01:31:54,430
talking a cigar in and out of her.

1621
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:57,610
I'm going to believe that he would have
thought she would've kept her mouth shut.

1622
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,150
I mean,
come on,

1623
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:03,430
dude. It was the other one dragged her
in, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1624
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:07,380
There'll be front.
Think about that position that he was at.

1625
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:11,860
The president of the United States is
literally at the top of the food chain of

1626
01:32:11,861 --> 01:32:16,480
human beings on the planet as far as the
most prestigious position in the world,

1627
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:17,530
in the world,
period.

1628
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:20,980
I mean it just is how much you love
being from Ireland or England or wherever

1629
01:32:20,981 --> 01:32:23,320
you're from. Top 10 that
guy, the president of,

1630
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:26,080
even if you don't respect president,

1631
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:30,010
put pub capture orders and the president
of bombs, president, president,

1632
01:32:30,030 --> 01:32:32,860
and in control the military.
This is no, no comparison.

1633
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:36,520
Pope's a joke compared to some religious
nuts though. It gets those chicks,

1634
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:39,830
they could them with bombs. Oh yeah.
If there was a war between though,

1635
01:32:39,950 --> 01:32:42,520
it's more between the president of
public president wins every time.

1636
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:46,810
He just sends all those pictures saved
up for years of all those guys getting

1637
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,220
their dick sucked by little boys.

1638
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:51,550
They just release those all over the
Internet and there's a massive campaign

1639
01:32:51,551 --> 01:32:53,830
against the Vatican would immediately,

1640
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:57,010
if there was ever a position where
the United States went to war with the

1641
01:32:57,011 --> 01:32:57,431
Vatican,

1642
01:32:57,431 --> 01:33:00,370
we wouldn't use bombs who'd use pictures
of them blowing his horn and more of

1643
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:03,400
those. Over the five year period.
They didn't have to be real man.

1644
01:33:03,410 --> 01:33:05,740
You mean how many fucking Photoshop
artists are there that worked for the

1645
01:33:05,741 --> 01:33:08,410
military? Luckily there's plenty
that they can find that are real,

1646
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:09,790
that was her constantly doing.

1647
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:13,630
I'm sure all you have to do a sit and
hidden cameras up or fall, these fox,

1648
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:17,590
wherever they go, and you've got to
find a certain percentage of a, really,

1649
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:20,020
all you have to do is give them all flip
phones and I'm sure someone will just

1650
01:33:20,021 --> 01:33:24,490
record themselves. Well, you know, I've
heard it argued on the online especially,

1651
01:33:24,491 --> 01:33:26,560
and it's really a fucking potent argument,

1652
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:31,030
that worry argument that the entire
Catholic religion at its highest levels

1653
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,300
exists for all these gay guys.

1654
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,280
I believe that coming
up at the highest level,

1655
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:39,620
not just covered it up and sent the guy
in the way covered up and sent him to,

1656
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:42,780
to write more kids and it's, yeah,
it's a culture that's from the vedic.

1657
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:46,390
A lot of them accepted a lot of
the boys except the position.

1658
01:33:46,391 --> 01:33:49,540
So a lot of the boys like it and
so they think that it's good.

1659
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,590
They think that they're
doing a good thing they did.

1660
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,160
There's literally things
that Ratzinger saw Ratzinger.

1661
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:57,490
Who is the guy who was the pope right now?
Pope Benedict is real.

1662
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:00,460
You might hit the Hitler youth.
No big deal,

1663
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:02,980
but there's,

1664
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:07,980
there's letters by this fucking guy that
this guy had under his review where um,

1665
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:12,130
these cardinals or bishops or
what are the fuck they were,

1666
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:17,280
we're actually specifically targeting
boys that had come from broken families.

1667
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:21,620
He was, they were asking for boys from
broken cars and wanting people to,

1668
01:34:21,621 --> 01:34:24,370
couldn't fight back as much,
anywhere to go.

1669
01:34:24,371 --> 01:34:28,090
They didn't have a family that they
can call him from beat your ass.

1670
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:31,560
Those are the people choosing how
you act in your religion. Lent,

1671
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,660
how long that lasts and what
you have to do this year,

1672
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,430
whether or not condoms are legal,
those are the people chosen.

1673
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:41,740
You can't be Catholic
anymore. Dirty, silly bitches.

1674
01:34:41,770 --> 01:34:45,880
You just can't, you're not a
Christian. It's so dumb. It's all dumb.

1675
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:48,620
But Catholicism is one of the worst.
That's,

1676
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:52,540
it's a cult of people who are
dressed up like fucking Jeanie's.

1677
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:57,720
They're dressed up like these crazy
wizard outfits with giant fish head hats

1678
01:34:58,641 --> 01:35:01,040
and,
and they're waving golden warns.

1679
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:06,041
It's 2012 and these assholes are dressed
up like they're like a fucking Harry

1680
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,120
Potter character. I mean,
it's preposterous. The idea
that that still exists,

1681
01:35:11,180 --> 01:35:15,320
then we still take that seriously.
My God, that's incredible.

1682
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:20,120
I mean it's, it's really
incredible. And you know, people
go, oh, you're so ignorant.

1683
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:22,470
You know, you hate religion, you hate I,

1684
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:26,000
I hate everything that stinks like shit.
And that

1685
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,050
shit up. It goes against
them. If he's a guy,

1686
01:35:30,051 --> 01:35:33,770
you want to have to give people fucking
birth control. If we're Christian,

1687
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:36,380
it's like, Oh, if I'm Jewish,

1688
01:35:36,381 --> 01:35:38,720
I don't have to let people get
Bacon with the money I give them.

1689
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:40,040
What are you arguing about?

1690
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,650
What all the fucking Christians
don't let anyone do anything.

1691
01:35:42,651 --> 01:35:46,700
They think they run. Everything can get
birth control to art, to, to, to girls.

1692
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:49,820
Because there's a lot of Catholics don't
want to have to offer that to people.

1693
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:53,330
Well, Catholics think did birth control
is actually bad. So then don't take it.

1694
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:56,180
The pope tells you that you're
not supposed to be using condoms,

1695
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:57,980
you're not supposed to
be using birth control.

1696
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,500
You're supposed to be having
sex for procreation only. Yeah,

1697
01:36:00,501 --> 01:36:01,670
so that's why they should do.

1698
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,340
And he said nothing to do
with what your employees need.

1699
01:36:04,490 --> 01:36:08,120
That's why boys have a boy pussy.
If you're a Christian scientist,

1700
01:36:08,121 --> 01:36:09,890
you can't deny all healthcare to your,

1701
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,560
to your workers because you don't
believe in healthcare. Yeah,

1702
01:36:12,561 --> 01:36:14,780
well there's just don't do it himself.
There's certainly that.

1703
01:36:14,781 --> 01:36:16,400
That's certainly a problem
if you're an employer,

1704
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:20,060
but I think overall the real problem
is that it's an ideology and it's an

1705
01:36:20,061 --> 01:36:22,780
ideology that's based on just
some shit that's written down.

1706
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:26,030
And the idea that there's a
god is not a preposterous idea.

1707
01:36:26,330 --> 01:36:29,450
If you look at the underlying
code of the universe,

1708
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:32,140
it's really the whole Fibonacci sequence.
That's it.

1709
01:36:32,170 --> 01:36:34,370
Reoccurs in nature over and over again.
This,

1710
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:36,510
this constant drive
towards going to flexing.

1711
01:36:36,710 --> 01:36:41,210
It may be very well be
complete coincidence or it
may be that there's some sort

1712
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:46,211
of an impossible to decipher grand plan
to it all and it might not be a deity

1713
01:36:47,091 --> 01:36:50,870
and it's in it as far as
how we look at it, like, uh,
being a person, we, you know,

1714
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:54,200
we, we anthropomorphize size.
That's what it was to be doing.

1715
01:36:54,230 --> 01:36:58,730
We didn't have an animal and you put it
in a human context. I mean, whatever,

1716
01:36:58,940 --> 01:37:03,290
however you would describe that. Putting
a God a deity into a human context,

1717
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:04,550
I think that's ridiculous.

1718
01:37:04,551 --> 01:37:09,350
I think the idea of it even being remotely
like our consciousness is ridiculous,

1719
01:37:09,530 --> 01:37:13,640
but it's not ridiculous that there's
some sort of a higher order. It doesn't,

1720
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:14,630
it doesn't seem to me,

1721
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:18,410
but what's ridiculous is all these stupid
old stories that everybody's based in

1722
01:37:18,411 --> 01:37:22,930
their life on circumcise and kids
and not, and pork. And you know,

1723
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:27,080
what are you talking about?
No water during the day crews for this.

1724
01:37:27,081 --> 01:37:29,840
You can do it if you want,
but don't fucking tell anyone else to oh,

1725
01:37:29,841 --> 01:37:33,020
cares what anyone else does. They don't
have to do your shit. Yeah, it's stupid.

1726
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:35,930
That's what it is. It's dumped.
But the problem is the EU.

1727
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:39,140
There's a lot of people out there that
really have a hard time thinking for

1728
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:43,760
themselves and they are happier when
someone comes along and they offer them a

1729
01:37:43,761 --> 01:37:45,950
predetermined pattern they can follow.

1730
01:37:46,190 --> 01:37:49,220
That's why religion works for a lot of
people. All right, so do it yourself.

1731
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:51,590
Don't force on it.
Anybody else. It's stupid.

1732
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:52,880
But do it yourself if you want to do it.

1733
01:37:52,940 --> 01:37:55,920
And then I think the problem with data
is that when someone's doing something,

1734
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:57,150
they want other people to do it too.

1735
01:37:57,151 --> 01:37:59,760
It's like when dudes go vegan
and they get douchey with you,

1736
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:02,700
how many times a year for that APP,
but they're happy that you're not vegan.

1737
01:38:03,030 --> 01:38:05,340
Sometimes they're happy that
they can look down on you.

1738
01:38:05,341 --> 01:38:08,040
And some where I've had guys like, come
on, man, you really need to try this.

1739
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:09,360
You really need to come on, man. I'm like,

1740
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,820
so you didn't need to get
the fuck away from me. Well,

1741
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:13,620
if I don't eat these animals,
so they're going to live forever,

1742
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:15,930
so I'm going to happen. They're going
to cure cancer. You stupid. Fuck.

1743
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,500
What are you saying? You're not
going to kill animals. What if,

1744
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:23,850
what if plants would scream when you
cut them down, would you still eat them?

1745
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:24,893
What if they made like a,

1746
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:31,670
as you cut the lettuce off the out of the
ground, what if it every freaking, yeah,

1747
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,310
would you be upset?
What if they loved it?

1748
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,920
But there's a something when
someone becomes something,

1749
01:38:40,921 --> 01:38:43,500
when they become a Republican,
when they become a windows user,

1750
01:38:43,501 --> 01:38:44,730
when they switched over to sprint,

1751
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:48,630
they want you to do it to everybody is
a lot of people that are weak like that

1752
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:52,520
man, they feel better when everybody else
is doing the same shit they're doing.

1753
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,300
If they're dressing like Johnny Cash,

1754
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:56,430
they want everybody else
address like Johnny Cash to it.

1755
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,273
You could tell them like,

1756
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,910
like literally this is the only
car that fits into my car port,

1757
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:04,380
but you need to buy American Bro.
Why you or they're like,

1758
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:07,410
it's a cohort over Chevy Ford guy,
Bro.

1759
01:39:07,490 --> 01:39:11,670
That was for a lot of side to side when
you were saying earlier, I'm a Ford Guy.

1760
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:16,110
Brow always bail for guide till I die.
You know it's funny, as Ford escorts,

1761
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:19,710
remember how gross that car he
used to be and it was a whole,

1762
01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:22,970
it's like the grossest car ever scored.

1763
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,860
That was before escorts were escorts
back then. They were prostitutes.

1764
01:39:25,861 --> 01:39:27,960
They called after it. They were
still escorts. They look done.

1765
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:33,660
Have you ever attempted to natural know
things like that? Temple, the Tabernacle,

1766
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,670
a tempo it and ask what,
did you ever have an escort?

1767
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:40,510
I don't know.
I never got,

1768
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:45,530
I never got an escort
Taurus's and sell a car.

1769
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:49,800
You for Ford is the only company that
didn't take money from the government and

1770
01:39:49,801 --> 01:39:51,960
his bail outs and then
they're still doing great.

1771
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:54,930
Who paid them back or when something
already just pay them fully back. No,

1772
01:39:54,931 --> 01:39:58,950
it's not true. No, we did try to
say that they paid them back fully,

1773
01:39:58,951 --> 01:39:59,790
but there's apparently,

1774
01:39:59,791 --> 01:40:02,910
there's a lot of funky malarkey
that I don't understand it.

1775
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:06,240
I'm not a financial guy, but the way
it's been explained to me, it's like, no,

1776
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:10,020
they're clearly taken away the idea that
we have any say in it. So it's like,

1777
01:40:10,050 --> 01:40:10,591
all right,
let's,

1778
01:40:10,591 --> 01:40:14,250
let's actually find out so that we
don't misinform people auto bail out,

1779
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:19,680
bail out payback, right?
What your mouth is agape,

1780
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:22,270
it's done and you're about to murmur.
I liked it.

1781
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:27,370
[inaudible] you know what the hell is
Tom is a house like that and I can't hear

1782
01:40:27,380 --> 01:40:29,610
it. Here's why. Here's the issue.
But while we're still on the subject,

1783
01:40:29,611 --> 01:40:31,530
because I did know that there
was something wrong about this.

1784
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:34,080
In the Washington examiner,
they have an argue.

1785
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:38,680
They have an article rather the truth
behind Chrysler's fake auto bailout

1786
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,533
payback.

1787
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:44,550
And apparently there's a lot of
fucking funny accounting of how they,

1788
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:45,384
yeah.

1789
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:49,200
American taxpayers have already spent
more than 13 billion bailing out Chrysler.

1790
01:40:49,201 --> 01:40:53,500
The Obama administration already forgave
more than 4 billion of that debt.

1791
01:40:53,501 --> 01:40:54,100
When the company

1792
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:57,940
filed for bankruptcy. Tax payers are
never going to get that money back,

1793
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:01,540
but how is Christ are going to pay
off the rest of the 7.6 billion?

1794
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:02,560
They own the Treasury Department.

1795
01:41:02,561 --> 01:41:07,561
The answer is the Obama administration's
bailout agreement with Fiat gave the

1796
01:41:07,931 --> 01:41:12,931
Italian car company in
tremendous incremental call
option that allows it to buy

1797
01:41:13,421 --> 01:41:16,960
up to 16% of Chrysler
stock at a reduced rate.

1798
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:22,080
But in order to exercise that option first
it had a payback at least 3.5 billion

1799
01:41:22,181 --> 01:41:25,870
of the loan to the Treasury
Department. So fee it's, it's,

1800
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:28,850
it's all like that is renting
them. Exactly. It's not,

1801
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:32,740
it's not like Chrysler became ballers
and paid all the money back and I'm like,

1802
01:41:32,741 --> 01:41:34,840
thanks. It worked. There's a,

1803
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:36,940
there's a lot of other shit
going on behind the scenes.

1804
01:41:36,941 --> 01:41:40,690
People are buying things and
selling things. You should be,

1805
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:45,700
are we should fear. I would, I would love
it if America made all the best shit.

1806
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:46,930
You know?
I mean,

1807
01:41:46,931 --> 01:41:50,110
I would think it would be amazing if
we could pull out of this and all of a

1808
01:41:50,111 --> 01:41:54,310
sudden make fucking bad ass cars and
shit. I would like to support that. I,

1809
01:41:54,311 --> 01:41:57,550
you know, when we buy, if you buy a
German car, you know that those people,

1810
01:41:57,551 --> 01:42:00,460
they're not slave labors, you
know. But if you, if you buy a car,

1811
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:03,820
like if they started selling cars that
are made in China like Foxconn and starts

1812
01:42:03,821 --> 01:42:07,390
making cars,
that's a tricky situation of being.

1813
01:42:07,391 --> 01:42:10,330
I would re rather pay more if
I could afford it. Of course.

1814
01:42:10,331 --> 01:42:14,950
Obviously we rather pay more if I knew
that the people who made my car got a

1815
01:42:14,951 --> 01:42:16,390
good wage,
wouldn't you?

1816
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:20,420
I, I've always bought Fords. I like
for zoning. Got Ford Mustang next.

1817
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:25,310
I think that or a charger. I, I've, I've
always bought Fords except Ford boy.

1818
01:42:25,820 --> 01:42:28,550
Yeah, I know. It's a Chrysler. I
known it's Chrysler is full of Shit.

1819
01:42:28,551 --> 01:42:31,270
Did you hear what I just, it looks
nice. They look dope. The charges

1820
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,440
best shapes out there.
They nailed it. They, they,

1821
01:42:33,450 --> 01:42:38,450
they made a modern version of
the 1970s in 1960s muscle car.

1822
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:39,940
They did it.
They fucking nailed it.

1823
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,520
They nailed it with the Camaro
to the new Camaro. Nailed it.

1824
01:42:42,521 --> 01:42:45,060
I saw crazy looking red
one with black stripes.

1825
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:49,380
It's a yellow one the other day. It
with driving one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1826
01:42:50,130 --> 01:42:52,680
They're great shit. I wouldn't buy yellow
car though. I wouldn't buy that car.

1827
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:55,050
Yeah, there's something about
a yellow car and it just, man,

1828
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:58,620
it's hard to prove you're not a douche
bag orange man. I've got Nacho orange,

1829
01:42:58,621 --> 01:43:00,480
at least all the Mexicans love me,

1830
01:43:00,481 --> 01:43:04,130
but it's like creepy orange all
the best at what you call it.

1831
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:08,780
The orange is what Ari cause it.
Fiesta all is. It feels like a fiesta.

1832
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:12,210
It's like going getting a Doritos.
It's like, I'm trying to think.

1833
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:16,210
Did they just had like an extra
gallon of that paint? I think so.

1834
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,550
That's why it got it so cheap because
it was that color, but now I want to,

1835
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:24,450
I want to murder that car. That car
was great. Brian, you have a great car.

1836
01:43:25,230 --> 01:43:27,850
American car also. That's
amazing. It's nice.

1837
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,690
It's about as nice as it gets
except for the new Cadillacs.

1838
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:33,960
The new Cadillacs are just about the
best American cars that have ever been

1839
01:43:33,961 --> 01:43:34,794
built.
Yeah,

1840
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:39,920
there's some new Cadillac CTSV and CTSV
coop it you're you're in blade runner.

1841
01:43:40,820 --> 01:43:44,490
The Romeos. None of those is
nine of them, I'm sure. Okay.

1842
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,900
So this boyfriend through catalogs from,

1843
01:43:45,901 --> 01:43:48,240
you're trying to relate to the
euro's auto workers. Oh really?

1844
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:51,980
Did he really say that? It goes,
in fact, I own an cars at my wife

1845
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:55,070
drives a Cadillac. In fact, she drives
two Cadillac's and you see all his,

1846
01:43:55,071 --> 01:43:59,540
if I was going, God damn it,
you stupid fast. What can
you say one you'd dumb cunt.

1847
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:03,560
He also said this at the same thing.
He goes, he goes, I love auto racing.

1848
01:44:03,561 --> 01:44:04,910
I've always loved,
obviously we've been a big fan.

1849
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:06,590
A lot of my friends are owners of

1850
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,380
why you're killing us. Hey, do you
want to go racing? If you ever, uh,

1851
01:44:13,630 --> 01:44:18,600
kind of two race cars, go around a track.
Remember that? What's it called? Place?

1852
01:44:18,630 --> 01:44:22,120
Did you go in that? What a called place?
Oh, Atlanta and Atlanta to uh, yeah,

1853
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:26,660
argues with me when we did a, yeah, I
went around the track. We, um, I uh,

1854
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:31,840
did some sort of a hosting thing for a
mini Cooper versus Porsche challenge as a

1855
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:35,600
race that they had in
a really close circuit.

1856
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,750
So like the big engine of the Porsche
didn't allow it to overtake the mini

1857
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:42,200
Cooper, which was speed. It was all just
about agility and real usable speed.

1858
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:46,550
It's pretty fucking impressive that a
mini Cooper was only like a couple of

1859
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:49,610
seconds behind a Porsche in this,
this race around these cones.

1860
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:51,870
I love those guys too. They're like, yeah,
they're like, are you guys going to win?

1861
01:44:51,871 --> 01:44:53,850
And they're like, we'll
see. And then they didn't,

1862
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:56,120
they didn't think they were going to win.
They're like probably not.

1863
01:44:56,121 --> 01:44:58,130
They didn't even, they just made
a little party for their owners.

1864
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,540
Well they didn't even get the
sport version mini Cooper, but not,

1865
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:05,120
they had a wagon wagon one that's
actually really have a regular version

1866
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:06,230
apparently.

1867
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:09,620
Like they had like all the people from
like the mini Cooper clubs and all that

1868
01:45:09,621 --> 01:45:12,740
shit come down. And there's people
that get fanatic about those cars,

1869
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:16,690
just like clubs and Shit there apparently
the most fun to drive and had a

1870
01:45:16,691 --> 01:45:17,524
barbecue.

1871
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:21,830
They invited any mini Cooper owner to
come out and you just get free barbecue.

1872
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:24,200
I got a chance to drive it a little bit,
but it was only around this,

1873
01:45:24,201 --> 01:45:27,590
you know the small course, but it's there.
They're like real agile, a little cars.

1874
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:31,190
They're like, it's like a go
cart. It's like you're so,
it's so small and so light,

1875
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:35,190
you know? It's like there's something fun
in that man. So what's this? I just got,

1876
01:45:35,191 --> 01:45:37,760
I remember got just got so high, I was
like, you were like, I got to work.

1877
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:41,510
So you do whatever you want it to.
It just get obliterated in Atlanta.

1878
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:45,850
We got obliterated as fuck that day.
Remember how hot it was?

1879
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:49,910
Sweltering Royce. The Atlanta
gets that crazy funky. Huh? Wait,

1880
01:45:49,911 --> 01:45:54,080
so when are you going to racing? I
don't know. I have a friend who uh,

1881
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:54,800
I mean they're not,

1882
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:57,200
I don't want to like have a
competition or anything like that.

1883
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:01,100
Just go around quick check that box.
You put chicken line too in Burbank.

1884
01:46:01,101 --> 01:46:03,920
They have adult go kart,
indoor adult go kart track.

1885
01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:06,750
And I was thinking like that'd be pretty
cool. Great. They can, you're doing that.

1886
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,720
I guess it got really fast. The owner of
the, how fast do they go? I don't know.

1887
01:46:10,310 --> 01:46:13,850
Whenever the ice house does
it. Okay, let's do that. Yeah.

1888
01:46:13,851 --> 01:46:16,820
You know there's a laser
tag place up here too.

1889
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,400
They still have laser tag 12 year old
kids. Look at what point we should do.

1890
01:46:19,401 --> 01:46:22,860
All those things don't card. You
should do all those bags. Shoot guns.

1891
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,320
I ain't fault. I have, I love
shooting in Israel, which to do that.

1892
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:29,390
Let's go shoot guns.
I shoot fish in a barrel,

1893
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:35,120
put fish up and then try to shoot fish
like dead fish. Why don't you do that?

1894
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:37,820
So I used to be taught things at target.
You did pick a gross,

1895
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:42,490
the American oh Derek Carr. Guns
into the air. Guns in the air.

1896
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:47,090
Just shoot him like pull and just throw
a official like put them like on like a

1897
01:46:47,091 --> 01:46:50,590
target. And then she tried
to blow up with fish. Oh,

1898
01:46:51,450 --> 01:46:53,580
throw him in the air and then
try to shoot him out of the sky.

1899
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:58,040
No shooting with Sean Miller
in Indianapolis. Yeah,

1900
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:01,080
it was so much fun. Yeah, it was great
fun pull. And you just bought it.

1901
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:04,740
And when you see it explodes.
Ah, yeah. It's like,

1902
01:47:04,741 --> 01:47:06,620
I mean even when you play pool
and you make it, you know,

1903
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:09,130
he makes fine ball and everyone
hangs out that they have it.

1904
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:12,510
Like they like a pro like area, you
know, everyone hangs out just like,

1905
01:47:12,511 --> 01:47:17,090
just like in pool people would hang out
or any place where he'll just chill a

1906
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:21,150
golf room. I have a buddy
Justin, these uh, they,

1907
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:25,440
they have like competitions where you'd
go through a maze. Like things come up,

1908
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:30,120
like when you blast them and you get like
a score and then you go like after you

1909
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:33,540
sold the area. Well this is bullets.
Yeah, that was, that was the cop.

1910
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:37,170
What was the cop cop
movies. Oh yeah. You killed,

1911
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:42,060
you killed a civilian again. Yeah. Gibson,
there's a lethal weapon. The funny ones.

1912
01:47:42,061 --> 01:47:45,300
But Berg attorney hitch with
City, Gothenburg, Gutenberg.

1913
01:47:45,330 --> 01:47:47,400
There were five police police academies.
Yeah.

1914
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:49,070
They had to go through those courses.
Yeah.

1915
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:51,990
Steve couldn't burn Tackleberry who died.

1916
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:56,280
There was this thing about Halloween that
ate what you would pay money and they

1917
01:47:56,281 --> 01:47:59,880
had like a hundred people dressed up as
zombies anywhere on top of the building

1918
01:47:59,881 --> 01:48:03,060
and now they all just start coming towards
you and it's paint ball and you just

1919
01:48:03,061 --> 01:48:06,030
shoot them charged. Oh
yeah. So they just like,

1920
01:48:06,060 --> 01:48:09,920
it's like you're not just false warmed
by trends. It was in Santa Monica.

1921
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:13,430
They wanted us to come down and cause
we were gonna have him on the pot.

1922
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:16,200
It's like what do they do when they
get ahold of you? You just shoot them.

1923
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:18,270
They're slowly climbing
up, you know, and you just,

1924
01:48:18,730 --> 01:48:21,780
and then they have to fall when they
get shot. I don't know. I didn't do it.

1925
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:26,030
So they're slowly coming
in on you like yeah,

1926
01:48:26,220 --> 01:48:30,630
they're hoarding you. It was
like call of duty zombies.

1927
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:34,110
They're eventually going to have a
game like the world's most deadly game.

1928
01:48:34,111 --> 01:48:36,660
Remember that movie? The
deadliest game? Whenever it was,

1929
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:41,590
I think there was what they redid it with
Gary Busey also.

1930
01:48:41,591 --> 01:48:46,200
It was hunting them ice tea was
the one being hunted. Oh yeah.

1931
01:48:46,201 --> 01:48:49,500
That's when I see him like
crazy dreadlocks. Yeah.

1932
01:48:49,501 --> 01:48:53,010
But there was an old version of it.
It's like the deadliest games really old.

1933
01:48:53,011 --> 01:48:57,750
It was like a Russian military guy who
was like crazy and Dupre talked to every

1934
01:48:57,751 --> 01:48:59,670
thought. These people, there's
island then when hunt them down.

1935
01:49:00,090 --> 01:49:01,530
And the reason why I,
um,

1936
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:05,190
well I remember this because I've been
watching this show called naked city.

1937
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:09,100
Have you seen the show and not that one?
Oh, hidden city, sorry. Not Negativity.

1938
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:13,750
Hidden city, hidden cities. All this
Marcus Shacki guy, he's a um, uh,

1939
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:19,290
crime novelist and he goes to all these
different towns and finds out like the

1940
01:49:19,291 --> 01:49:21,540
really fucked up stories in this town.

1941
01:49:21,541 --> 01:49:25,110
Like all the crazy murderers and shit
that hasn't, that haven't been solved.

1942
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:29,220
And one of them was a dude who would pick
up hookers and he would take them in a

1943
01:49:29,221 --> 01:49:32,910
plane and Alaska picked him up,
put him in us, handcuffed him,

1944
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:36,630
put him in his plane and then fly
them to an island and let them loose.

1945
01:49:36,630 --> 01:49:39,390
And then he would go and hunt them.
Really?

1946
01:49:40,200 --> 01:49:43,170
He brought it would bring a rifle and
he would let them loose and just go,

1947
01:49:43,171 --> 01:49:46,530
you better run. You better run
around. I'm coming after you bitch.

1948
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:48,760
And then he would go after, I
mean hunting, we track them down.

1949
01:49:48,761 --> 01:49:51,990
They'd be like in the snow. So
it'd be like tracking them. Yeah.

1950
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:55,030
But it was like the thrill of actually
tracking them. Fucking blow him away.

1951
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:57,910
And then he would keep their,
um, their licenses and shit.

1952
01:49:57,911 --> 01:50:01,060
And that's how they caught him.
What do we want it to his attic attic.

1953
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:04,930
He had driver's licenses of all these
different women that he killed because

1954
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:06,070
they had searched his place once.

1955
01:50:06,071 --> 01:50:09,130
They couldn't find anything and they
had a search place again. And uh,

1956
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:11,350
when they searched this place again,
they found it in the attic.

1957
01:50:11,500 --> 01:50:14,260
I shouldn't keep mentos
they can't help themselves.

1958
01:50:14,290 --> 01:50:16,240
They tell us people want to be competent.
I think that's what it is.

1959
01:50:16,241 --> 01:50:17,830
I think they just like
keeping them or mentos well,

1960
01:50:17,831 --> 01:50:21,160
they look back at those momentos and they,
they have, they get excited trophies.

1961
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:23,980
Yeah. I don't think it's like,
I'm looking to get caught though.

1962
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,590
You think you're looking not
to and keep these things,

1963
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:29,140
you get more complacent than
what you do it. I blamed my mom.

1964
01:50:29,141 --> 01:50:32,320
She always had like that book when you're
a kid and I had like little lock of

1965
01:50:32,321 --> 01:50:36,130
your hair and stuff like that and I always
was attracted like law locks of hairs,

1966
01:50:36,131 --> 01:50:39,820
you know, with the girls that I date.
What would you ever, would you ever,

1967
01:50:39,821 --> 01:50:43,720
if it was on the menu, would you try
human meat? No. No, you would never do it.

1968
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:47,350
It's supposed to taste just like pork.
Really? Yeah. And you can always eat pork.

1969
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,260
So why would I try human meat? I don't
want to know what that tastes like.

1970
01:50:51,670 --> 01:50:55,120
Apparently though, obviously would,
it must be distinguishable because uh,

1971
01:50:55,650 --> 01:50:59,340
well you can go to Liberia and you
can get some crazy anymore. The worst.

1972
01:50:59,370 --> 01:51:02,230
I know the war's done, so they're
not serving any more human meet.

1973
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:06,430
Charlie Charles Taylor was in the Hague.
Charles Taylor's, the guy was the, the,

1974
01:51:06,431 --> 01:51:10,690
the horrible war criminal
crazy fucking name.

1975
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:13,750
Charles Taylor. Yeah. Sounds like
the guy who had created peanuts,

1976
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:16,080
they destroy their own
infrastructure there.

1977
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:18,530
Would they need to like stuff
to tie people up with slate?

1978
01:51:18,540 --> 01:51:21,130
Just he was like telephone wire.
They would cut it down and just use that.

1979
01:51:21,190 --> 01:51:24,910
She sort of like, oh now we have
no telephone lines. Jesus Christ,

1980
01:51:25,030 --> 01:51:26,400
if that's their rockets out.
So they're like,

1981
01:51:26,410 --> 01:51:28,570
let me just show you how much I can blow
this thing up and then you show me how

1982
01:51:28,571 --> 01:51:33,010
much that rock can blow his damn. They
blow up. Blow up down. They're so stupid.

1983
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:35,560
The whole, the the
Liberia. So frightening.

1984
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:38,470
And the fact that it used to be
a u s slave colony. Really? Yeah.

1985
01:51:38,471 --> 01:51:41,560
That's how it started. It's all
better now. Slaves came from Liberia.

1986
01:51:44,190 --> 01:51:46,810
Yeah. Wow. It's better now. In what way?

1987
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:49,860
Charles tells gone or trying to
like redo everything. Mass Man.

1988
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:54,360
They had the vice guide to Liberia. It
was pretty recent. They were over there.

1989
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,190
It's still crazy. Yeah. This
is parts of the world where,

1990
01:51:57,220 --> 01:51:59,230
how the fuck do you fix Africa?

1991
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:01,690
Look at all the different like
look at you gone to look at it.

1992
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:06,190
I mean that's a long, long, long
project. They wanted to give juice.

1993
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:08,140
You're going to get them Jewish.

1994
01:52:08,170 --> 01:52:12,030
They wanted to give the Jews Uganda
instead of Israel. So listen,

1995
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:16,480
figure this place as a lot of talk about
that. When was this? 60 no, no, no, no.

1996
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:20,320
Wait before that, I guess the
forties and thirties the war Israel,

1997
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:22,900
after the war they were like,
we need to give him some place to go.

1998
01:52:23,230 --> 01:52:24,790
Clearly we've shown enough times,

1999
01:52:25,110 --> 01:52:30,110
we just explain to me how the whole Israel
thing worked because at one point in

2000
01:52:30,641 --> 01:52:34,900
time Palestinians live there,
but no Jews live there already.

2001
01:52:34,901 --> 01:52:37,210
Like a bunch of different migrations.

2002
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:41,080
Well Jews live there and Arabs live
there a long time ago and then one of the

2003
01:52:41,081 --> 01:52:44,710
Roman kings came and like dispersed.
The Jews killed him. Yeah, well no,

2004
01:52:44,711 --> 01:52:46,330
just like say extinguished

2005
01:52:46,330 --> 01:52:48,320
something like go to Europe,
go to Africa.

2006
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:53,560
Just go pick them all out here.
What you've, what year was this?

2007
01:52:53,561 --> 01:52:55,270
This we're talking about like um,

2008
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:59,600
this is way after Jesus I think.

2009
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:03,550
I think because Jews were around when
Jesus was there way after Jesus and after

2010
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:04,790
one temple was destroyed,

2011
01:53:04,791 --> 01:53:07,670
then the Jews wouldn't go back until they
rebuilt the second temple. Then I did.

2012
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:10,360
Then they came back when that
was a story and they kicked out,

2013
01:53:10,361 --> 01:53:12,650
like they slowly started
coming back here or there.

2014
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:17,000
So like in 1910 it was a big migration.
1912 big migration of,

2015
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:18,590
of European Jews to Israel.

2016
01:53:18,650 --> 01:53:23,650
What temple was it where the Romans got
all the way up to the top and the Jews

2017
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:29,100
Massada what? There wasn't a temple. It
was, it was it last enclave of defense.

2018
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:32,760
They were resisting. So when did
they do, what was the store? They uh,

2019
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:33,321
went up there.

2020
01:53:33,321 --> 01:53:35,760
It was one of those things that one
of the Roman kings built for like the

2021
01:53:36,170 --> 01:53:40,610
getaway, a sweet, sweet getaway. Um, it's
really awesome actually. They have these,

2022
01:53:40,670 --> 01:53:41,503
these um,

2023
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:45,890
hot baths and they would like empty out
like the part of mountain underneath.

2024
01:53:45,891 --> 01:53:46,491
It's like a heat it,

2025
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:50,270
up until then we come up with the ceilings
were curved down because they knew

2026
01:53:50,271 --> 01:53:54,090
that if they were flat, the water
drops put like hit and just like form.

2027
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:56,960
And that hit you. That was really
unpleasantly minimal curved.

2028
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:01,080
So the water would run down the
curved ceilings not drip onto you?

2029
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:05,990
Um, yeah, just really great
design things. But anyway,

2030
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,500
as the Jews are being pushed out,
send, convert or leave or die,

2031
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:11,030
I guess some of them,

2032
01:54:11,031 --> 01:54:15,080
the last defenses like push back to there
and they realized they could just like,

2033
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:17,420
there's only one way up.
So they just,

2034
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:20,060
they can just shoot down
arrows at people at the Romans.

2035
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:21,930
They couldn't get up there,
um,

2036
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:26,340
until they started using Jewish
slaves as human shields, uh,

2037
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:28,850
and then started marching up.
But also they are,

2038
01:54:28,851 --> 01:54:31,730
they had enough food and water
to last them for like so long.

2039
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:34,760
So they will wait you out.
We'll just wait you out for years.

2040
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,810
And they just had him surrounded like
that, that much, that much supplies.

2041
01:54:38,811 --> 01:54:41,060
And then eventually when I think the
human slaves, right then they were like,

2042
01:54:41,061 --> 01:54:43,580
all right, but we're not going to kill
our own. So what are we going to do?

2043
01:54:43,581 --> 01:54:45,530
And I think they are just,
they all kill each other. Well,

2044
01:54:45,531 --> 01:54:46,430
we're not going to kill her own,

2045
01:54:46,431 --> 01:54:48,950
so we'll kill our own will just help
commit suicide. We're dead anyway.

2046
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:52,250
So did they commit suicide when they
use these swords? Right? So words.

2047
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:55,730
Is that what it was? A lot of it wasn't
it? Where were they? Get poisoned.

2048
01:54:55,731 --> 01:54:58,250
It wouldn't be poison. Poison. Yeah.

2049
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:02,090
I don't know that it was when it
was done in a very primal way.

2050
01:55:02,300 --> 01:55:05,310
It could be sourced. It could have been
swords. And I know like the last guy,

2051
01:55:05,311 --> 01:55:09,350
I had to do it to himself and then chose
who was going to be that last guy. Wow.

2052
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:10,740
Go.
That's what it is.

2053
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:12,440
They didn't want to commit suicide
cause you're not going to heaven.

2054
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:15,740
So you would kill another person. So you
didn't have to kill yourself. Sit alone.

2055
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:21,390
I had to commit suicide or he just
didn't look at all these juicy Ron at the

2056
01:55:22,251 --> 01:55:25,700
Romans
by cops or go,

2057
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:28,610
oh you guys come up this way.
I came up back over there.

2058
01:55:28,611 --> 01:55:33,611
This Jews are all day and that's
probably why I choose my clothes.

2059
01:55:33,621 --> 01:55:36,220
And then, and then, uh, and
then times Roman outfits.

2060
01:55:38,810 --> 01:55:41,850
Wow. What a fucking crazy
time to be alive. That must,

2061
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:44,900
you had to give them to religion or die.
Oh,

2062
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:49,510
should be easy.

2063
01:55:49,780 --> 01:55:53,670
It just shows you that people have always
had that weird desire to have everyone

2064
01:55:53,671 --> 01:55:57,660
else think exactly the way they thought.
It makes them feel more secure.

2065
01:55:57,690 --> 01:55:59,370
Christians more crystallized.

2066
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:02,970
It's more Christians did Jews actually
never proselytized. That's amazing,

2067
01:56:02,971 --> 01:56:05,590
isn't it? Yeah. Why is that?
Because of your religion? It's just,

2068
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:08,870
it's silly as anybody else's based on the
same things. Yeah, it was the question.

2069
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:11,460
So how come they figured out to like
keep to themselves and it said like,

2070
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:15,420
you don't have to do this. There's no
reason you should if you want to, you can,

2071
01:56:15,421 --> 01:56:17,400
but we're not going to try to push
her. I was like, do whatever you want.

2072
01:56:17,730 --> 01:56:21,600
The time of David, they outlawed
it. Outlawed conversion.
Wow. It was too popular.

2073
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:23,970
Too popular. But he wanted
to be a judge. You just,

2074
01:56:23,971 --> 01:56:27,180
because it was like they were the
ruling party. Really? Yeah. Damn.

2075
01:56:27,181 --> 01:56:30,360
So they outlawed it. So they said no
conversion during this time, John,

2076
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:34,410
for how long? Oh No, please.
I'm fine. Yeah, I don't know.
Now you have to do that.

2077
01:56:34,411 --> 01:56:36,670
You have to ask a bunch of times.
I'm just hanging out.

2078
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:40,260
I don't like these people do that. Now.
You have to do that. Most of the whites,

2079
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,360
I don't want to be that ever. You
pretty much have to do that. The rabbit,

2080
01:56:43,361 --> 01:56:44,580
I'll tell you like, don't, don't do this.

2081
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:47,460
You don't want to do it really any
big macs or can't just trust me.

2082
01:56:47,461 --> 01:56:50,280
You don't want to do this. He Cuny
big MACs. Yeah. If you're a Jew,

2083
01:56:50,290 --> 01:56:53,450
you can't eat big MACs, religious Jew,
you know you're supposed to eat hamburger.

2084
01:56:53,450 --> 01:56:57,000
Is that what it is? It's not kosher
meat and it's cheese on there too. Oh,

2085
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:00,780
so just that in general.
But you could have kosher beef burgers.

2086
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:04,530
You can have a kosher beef burger
with, with soy cheese. Oh, the cheese.

2087
01:57:04,740 --> 01:57:07,320
What is it you can't combine and
milk and meat. Is that what it is?

2088
01:57:07,770 --> 01:57:10,710
What's that all about? Uh, it's,
it's pretty much a stupidity,

2089
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:12,320
just like all the religions.
But uh,

2090
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:17,930
it's based on a passage that says you
shall not mix the meat of the mother or

2091
01:57:18,391 --> 01:57:23,050
the milk of the milk of the mother with
the meat of the calf. Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

2092
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:26,190
Wasn't about sex horn. Instead
or anything else? Some sex.

2093
01:57:26,191 --> 01:57:29,490
Take that just to be that it's, it's
that actual mother and calf. Yeah,

2094
01:57:29,491 --> 01:57:30,271
but that's the case.

2095
01:57:30,271 --> 01:57:33,240
Why can't you get the milk from the mother
and then kill the mother and he heard

2096
01:57:33,241 --> 01:57:35,410
some milk of the mother and the meat
of the mother. That's all right.

2097
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:38,740
I don't run it. I'm really good at,
it's just they just no meat and milk.

2098
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:42,300
You have to wait. If you eat pizza, you
have to wait 30 minutes for you meet.

2099
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:43,440
What are the odds though,

2100
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:46,890
if I have a fucking piece of meat that
the milk is gonna come from the same? No,

2101
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:47,251
it's not.

2102
01:57:47,251 --> 01:57:50,280
They said that means they said that
passage means don't mix it two at all.

2103
01:57:50,550 --> 01:57:54,900
Fuck you. Linen and cotton. You can't
mix, but yeah, but you can't. If you're,

2104
01:57:54,940 --> 01:57:57,990
if you have a, if you have like a, a
woolen the linen, that's what it is.

2105
01:57:58,230 --> 01:57:59,640
If you have a wool jacket,

2106
01:57:59,670 --> 01:58:03,630
you can't have linen things tying in the
buttons cause that's evil and you'll go

2107
01:58:03,631 --> 01:58:07,760
to hell when backing up and go to hell
for now. My favorite one, chocolate.

2108
01:58:07,770 --> 01:58:10,950
My favorite one that you told me to this
day was that you were told that when

2109
01:58:10,951 --> 01:58:13,530
you masturbate for that,
people don't really know.

2110
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:18,120
Ari grew up extremely religious
to the point where he lived.

2111
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:21,270
You lived on lives in Israel and
your show for two years. Yeah,

2112
01:58:21,271 --> 01:58:26,070
I mean that's the Torah all day long.
9:00 PM 10 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM I mean,

2113
01:58:26,071 --> 01:58:26,904
dad is,

2114
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:30,840
that's some pretty intense shit and they
told you when you masturbated that you

2115
01:58:30,841 --> 01:58:35,520
were impregnating a demon and the, let's
just say you're on your back lying down.

2116
01:58:35,910 --> 01:58:38,640
They didn't really do positions
back then in our shower anyway,

2117
01:58:38,641 --> 01:58:41,560
but when you're doing it, some demon
comes and like, she's like round you,

2118
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,530
fucking you as you're fucking your hand

2119
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:49,900
and then you make like demon babies and
they have some writer uses the phage.

2120
01:58:50,110 --> 01:58:53,700
There was some like maybe it's in coons,
everything coons,

2121
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:56,920
she use it in a movie or some
deep know in a book. There's some,

2122
01:58:57,010 --> 01:58:59,050
some demon was like riding
them and had anyway,

2123
01:58:59,051 --> 01:59:01,660
but then you get her pregnant and she
has babies. Every time you do that,

2124
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:05,070
every time you're 100% as babies.
Never going to be one on earth,

2125
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:08,940
only live in this demon world.
Milt have formed and gross. Why?

2126
01:59:09,020 --> 01:59:12,580
I forgot about this. And then when
you get to go to heaven, when you die,

2127
01:59:12,910 --> 01:59:17,020
you have to meet those demons.
Oh my God. And they got, Why dad?

2128
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:21,940
Why couldn't we barn on the regular
planet? Wow. Why aren't you like this?

2129
01:59:21,941 --> 01:59:25,810
That so did you mastered with this anyway,
even knowing all this,

2130
01:59:27,490 --> 01:59:29,410
and what did you think was,
was this going on?

2131
01:59:29,411 --> 01:59:31,690
Why you were living in this like
really religious environment?

2132
01:59:31,691 --> 01:59:34,420
You were asking me and you never saw him
masturbating. You never stop. I mean,

2133
01:59:34,421 --> 01:59:38,980
I slowed down. I thought it
was evil for doing it. Well,
like, so you're doing this,

2134
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:43,260
you're there 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM did you
think, well that part's bullshit. You,

2135
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:46,240
you're studying like this
intense religious, well, there's,

2136
01:59:46,241 --> 01:59:48,140
I think there's two types of sense.
Literally this is how it is.

2137
01:59:48,141 --> 01:59:50,540
There's 2000 since there's, since you
plan out and say fuck it. I don't,

2138
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:54,130
I don't agree with that. And this types
like gossip where it just happens.

2139
01:59:54,550 --> 01:59:57,030
You're not thinking about it like,
fuck, I shouldn't have done that. Right.

2140
01:59:57,040 --> 02:00:00,820
Talking about about
somebody's masturbation is
one that just overcomes you,

2141
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:01,480
but it's one,

2142
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:04,450
I guess it's one that you do
plan out because you could
just not do it this time.

2143
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:07,390
Oh, you accidentally touched it.
Women I don't think have the same.

2144
02:00:07,420 --> 02:00:11,050
It's not theirs. They don't have
that backup. Women want to have sex.

2145
02:00:11,051 --> 02:00:13,960
They get itchy.
They want do they want it to be touched?

2146
02:00:13,961 --> 02:00:15,100
They want affection to get horny.

2147
02:00:15,420 --> 02:00:19,780
But we have like a backup of sperm
where like your Dick is like, come on,

2148
02:00:19,781 --> 02:00:24,400
let's go. It's like you got to get
rid of this shit. Jesus Christ.

2149
02:00:24,401 --> 02:00:28,210
We can't even think you'd sour
milk everywhere here. Come on.

2150
02:00:29,350 --> 02:00:33,070
What did you, when you beat off, did you
like go fuck. What about those babies?

2151
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,240
Did you believe that part?

2152
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:38,140
That part was more like fables
is wasn't like the written Torah.

2153
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:41,980
So it was like this is what's, this is
what like the extra curricular stuff,

2154
02:00:41,981 --> 02:00:44,710
the ghosts and shit like that.
So when would they bring that up?

2155
02:00:44,711 --> 02:00:48,460
How'd you they barely brought that up.
Did they bring it up in class ever? Yeah,

2156
02:00:48,461 --> 02:00:49,111
we'll come up.

2157
02:00:49,111 --> 02:00:52,660
We're in discussions with
rabbis who studied all that
stuff that the uh, the um,

2158
02:00:52,900 --> 02:00:56,380
the Zahar Zahar which just
like the mystical book,

2159
02:00:57,010 --> 02:01:00,280
but you're not supposed to say that
until you're married in 35. What is it?

2160
02:01:00,290 --> 02:01:04,990
Second Mystical Book said you can't set
handle it until you're married and 35 at

2161
02:01:04,991 --> 02:01:09,070
least set up. It's got all this stuff
about ghosts and weird shit. Ghosts.

2162
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:14,560
The Olin's is go Siemens and crossing
dude Judaism sounds like fun.

2163
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:16,600
Sounds like fun. Literate. You
don't get to read it very much.

2164
02:01:16,601 --> 02:01:19,030
I never read the translation to was
and so hard. Maybe I should read it.

2165
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:21,990
Can you get it online? Can you bobbing
by now he's talking about comicon.

2166
02:01:22,090 --> 02:01:23,560
It's probably all written
down somewhere actually,

2167
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:25,510
but a lot of it would
be the exact language.

2168
02:01:25,511 --> 02:01:28,170
You wouldn't get that from transition,
but you look at clothes. Yeah.

2169
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:31,570
There was this piece, there was
this one piece and a in the Talmud,

2170
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:33,820
which is like a respect of like
you're supposed to study apart.

2171
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,020
And they said this rock,

2172
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:40,050
this rabbi went to his students who were
living in like a dormitory altogether

2173
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:44,990
because there was a s a snake or a dragon
that was attacking them every night

2174
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:46,430
and killing his students.

2175
02:01:47,180 --> 02:01:50,360
So he had to sleep and only the rabbi
was the one who gets to feed it.

2176
02:01:50,361 --> 02:01:54,800
So he had to sleep under one
of their beds, um, so that
he could kill this dragon.

2177
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,500
It was a dragon. And I asked
my rabid about that. I'm like,

2178
02:01:57,501 --> 02:02:02,030
what the fuck is this all about?
Uh, it's my way. What's going on?

2179
02:02:02,031 --> 02:02:05,270
There's no seconds. Dragons, this is
all under this bed to suck your cock.

2180
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:08,000
And that's how I killed the Dragon.
Yeah, he said there was a rash.

2181
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:12,650
It was a rash of jerk offs going on and
the only way that he did so they can't

2182
02:02:12,651 --> 02:02:15,200
really write that out in the Talmud.
So they had a metaphor.

2183
02:02:15,250 --> 02:02:17,660
It was a rash of jerk offs.
And the only way I could stop it.

2184
02:02:17,661 --> 02:02:22,010
It's a rabbi hiding under their bed
saying, I call you. You're masturbating.

2185
02:02:22,190 --> 02:02:23,150
Wow.

2186
02:02:23,150 --> 02:02:27,710
So the dragon that was killing us it
the children was just damn masturbating,

2187
02:02:27,711 --> 02:02:31,670
desire to masturbate. Oh my
God. Their spiritual selves.

2188
02:02:31,730 --> 02:02:35,360
Holy Shit. That's hilarious.
Yet. But it's not written.

2189
02:02:35,361 --> 02:02:38,200
That metaphor is not explained.
It's just, it's just assumed.

2190
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:42,150
And you have to ask someone who
understands the tax or Rashi would.

2191
02:02:42,151 --> 02:02:45,950
It looked quite stuff about,
if you can understand that,
that's so crazy, man. Well,

2192
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:49,070
how would that in the future, people
would just think it's just craziness.

2193
02:02:49,071 --> 02:02:51,410
This was an oral tradition too,
so it wasn't written down.

2194
02:02:51,530 --> 02:02:53,720
Someone just had to tell you that story.
Wow.

2195
02:02:53,740 --> 02:02:55,400
That's so they wrote down when they
thought they were going to lose it all.

2196
02:02:55,700 --> 02:03:00,590
That's amazing. Wow. That
is a great fucking story.

2197
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:03,630
You think I'd be making that up, but
I'm really not. It's hilarious. Yeah,

2198
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:07,210
there's were so crazy.
And people, you know,

2199
02:03:07,430 --> 02:03:11,150
whenever we have these conversations
about religion and so really interesting

2200
02:03:11,151 --> 02:03:15,440
because I get so many angry
tweets [inaudible] get, they
get so mad and an idiot.

2201
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:17,810
There's literally zero proof for it.

2202
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:21,650
There's zero proof ever and there's
nothing else in your life that you will

2203
02:03:21,651 --> 02:03:24,980
entertain a conversation over
when there's zero proof, nothing.

2204
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:28,880
That's the only thing. If someone tried
to invent any of those religions today,

2205
02:03:28,881 --> 02:03:30,920
you would laugh at them? Yes.
You'd say this is a call,

2206
02:03:30,921 --> 02:03:33,710
but somehow we can't because everyone's
involved in it and I just like,

2207
02:03:33,711 --> 02:03:36,800
it's ridiculous what you're
doing. Completely ridiculous.
And I say that it's the,

2208
02:03:36,801 --> 02:03:40,670
it's the enemy of progress
because you're not,

2209
02:03:40,671 --> 02:03:42,890
you don't does that's
not on the table anymore.

2210
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:48,100
Everything is on the table as far as I
mean not is as far as like what is the

2211
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:52,430
possibility for the culture?
Clothing. I'll real loud.
What is subatomic particles?

2212
02:03:52,431 --> 02:03:54,530
What is, what is, you know
what, what are in black holes?

2213
02:03:54,531 --> 02:03:58,880
Everything is really on the table and
and up to discovery until it comes to

2214
02:03:58,881 --> 02:04:01,940
religion. And what religion
that's not on a table, if you,

2215
02:04:01,941 --> 02:04:04,190
if anything is off the table like that,
like stem,

2216
02:04:04,191 --> 02:04:07,420
stem cell research or things along
those lines of religion. Yeah,

2217
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:10,370
because of religion, especially when you
can get stem cells from skin. I mean,

2218
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:14,090
they're at a point now where you don't,
you don't need to have embryos.

2219
02:04:14,091 --> 02:04:17,570
You don't need to encourage people to
have abortions like they thought the worst

2220
02:04:17,571 --> 02:04:18,860
case scenario,
whatever it be,

2221
02:04:18,861 --> 02:04:22,640
that people would be a courage to kill
their babies because stem cells from the

2222
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:25,620
aborted fetus can be very valuable. That's
not even necessary anymore. They've,

2223
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:27,320
they've passed that,
but we're still human.

2224
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:31,260
It's still there because of our
belief in a god. Yeah. Yeah.

2225
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:33,740
Some of those methods so long ago,
it doesn't apply to you anymore.

2226
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:36,590
Even if it was invented for a reason,
it doesn't apply to you anymore.

2227
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:39,300
It's just the ridiculous thing
is that if this God did exist,

2228
02:04:39,301 --> 02:04:42,330
that he wouldn't tell you while you're
fucking up left and right and surely

2229
02:04:42,331 --> 02:04:46,440
setting yourself to house, we're just
assigned asshole. Wait there and go.

2230
02:04:46,441 --> 02:04:48,480
Listen when you get up here,

2231
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:51,450
I know this is life has been confusing
and everybody's full of Shit and they

2232
02:04:51,451 --> 02:04:52,740
been telling you these crazy stories,

2233
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:55,350
but if you don't listen to
them once you get up here,

2234
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:58,240
the infinite wisdom is gonna
fucking cookie. I got mad at God.

2235
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:00,690
I started thinking about this
stuff. It was like, what the fuck?

2236
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:05,100
So you're telling me that everyone goes
to heaven or doesn't or it gets rewarded

2237
02:05:05,101 --> 02:05:08,730
on the next plane or doesn't based on,
you've never been explicit. Just said,

2238
02:05:08,731 --> 02:05:10,890
I want you to do this and
you're supposed to guess it.

2239
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,710
My Protestant friends where like if you
don't accept Jesus, you're going to hell.

2240
02:05:13,890 --> 02:05:16,320
And I'm like, what's your
parents were, were Christian,

2241
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,110
so you're better chance of
accepting Jesus and mine.

2242
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:21,720
So just because randomly
and my parents were Jewish,

2243
02:05:21,960 --> 02:05:25,200
I'm going to burn in hell for eternity.
It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

2244
02:05:25,201 --> 02:05:28,800
Like God wouldn't just intervene and say,
listen parents,

2245
02:05:28,801 --> 02:05:32,670
you're teaching your children wrong. This
is what I like. I like, I liked him too.

2246
02:05:32,671 --> 02:05:36,240
If you're a native American a
hundred years after Jesus came,

2247
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:38,460
you've never heard of him. But if you
don't accept that you're going to hell,

2248
02:05:38,610 --> 02:05:42,270
you had no chance. Yeah. You
go to hell, just go to hell.

2249
02:05:42,330 --> 02:05:45,000
Burn forever for your sin.
You know where they say, well,

2250
02:05:45,001 --> 02:05:46,980
some people will believe that
Jesus is actually went to America.

2251
02:05:46,981 --> 02:05:50,040
And so we'd like told them
like one time and the left.

2252
02:05:50,041 --> 02:05:53,130
And so that was enough of generations.
They were Protestant friends tells you,

2253
02:05:53,131 --> 02:05:58,131
this is the only song so stupid about
Jesus and America was the Mormon,

2254
02:05:58,681 --> 02:06:03,360
the Mormons. They believed that
he fucking, he, he was the, uh,

2255
02:06:03,380 --> 02:06:07,320
that's where the, uh, the American
Indians came from. They were lost juice.

2256
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:12,710
This, this is it. It's an India.

2257
02:06:14,450 --> 02:06:17,130
That's how ridiculous. I used to
have a joke about it, but I said,

2258
02:06:17,131 --> 02:06:18,840
but never really formed it.
But this is what it was.

2259
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:22,220
There's other parts of that same
book that say what the Mormons do.

2260
02:06:22,221 --> 02:06:25,530
I've told you this, right? Yeah. When they
said he went to the moon, but with, yeah,

2261
02:06:26,100 --> 02:06:26,761
with more,

2262
02:06:26,761 --> 02:06:31,440
with more Hebrew people and start a
little race of people called the lunar

2263
02:06:31,441 --> 02:06:35,250
Syrians. No. Where they still
live to this day. No. Yes.

2264
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:38,340
Or at least they were saying that until
we went to the moon and then we're like,

2265
02:06:38,341 --> 02:06:42,490
what's up? Like it's the linear. He said,
and here's my thing. This is what they,

2266
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:44,160
and they didn't answer.
They just stopped teaching it,

2267
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:46,800
but this is what they said was
like, oh, well when we made that up,

2268
02:06:47,250 --> 02:06:50,400
we didn't think anybody would actually
go to the fucking moon. Call us on it.

2269
02:06:50,820 --> 02:06:52,520
It was like 200 years
ago. We're like, oh yeah,

2270
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:54,930
we'll take a golden light of
the moon and call me on my lie.

2271
02:06:55,960 --> 02:06:59,400
It's so funny. It's so probably the
people, what are they doing up there?

2272
02:06:59,401 --> 02:07:01,980
What do you think? There's no atmosphere.
You know? We didn't know any of that.

2273
02:07:02,380 --> 02:07:05,830
We didn't know shit. Yeah,
more templates. Yeah.

2274
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,670
Joseph Smith was 14 he founded,
understood it.

2275
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:13,970
When he said he found that the lost
tablets and they say it only he could read

2276
02:07:14,191 --> 02:07:17,640
because he had a seer stone. He had
a magic stone and he was looking at,

2277
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:20,160
that's who's going to be the next
republican president for county.

2278
02:07:20,161 --> 02:07:22,960
I believe in all that.
Mitt Romney did.

2279
02:07:23,110 --> 02:07:27,090
You seen the trailer for
promethium speaking of
ridiculous science fiction movie

2280
02:07:27,180 --> 02:07:30,450
to move new Ridley Scott movie,
the Prequel to alien. Oh no,

2281
02:07:30,451 --> 02:07:35,010
really don't watch the trailer. They
give away just too much going on in the,

2282
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,400
there's a few spoilers,

2283
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:39,280
but God damn does it look good.
Ooh,

2284
02:07:39,281 --> 02:07:42,670
it looks good right now.
So she's an innocent man.

2285
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:45,740
Charlise the Ron [inaudible].
It's a prequel.

2286
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:52,120
Couldn't Charlise that all is the new
bad ass chick do it is it looks fucking

2287
02:07:52,121 --> 02:07:56,470
Trump. I won't watch it then
drill it. It looks so good.

2288
02:07:56,530 --> 02:08:00,340
It's coming out June.
My Dick is hard until June.

2289
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:02,980
We were talking about with Doug Benson
that one time, but trailers, it ruins the,

2290
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,290
for you. It's the scene. It says
you thought it was dead, didn't you?

2291
02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:10,960
He's not dead. Yeah, they try. They
try so hard to get you into the movie.

2292
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:15,610
It really pisses off a lot of
get solid. Yeah. You fuck heads.

2293
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:17,320
You give away huge plot points.

2294
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:20,020
There's some movies that it's
almost useless to go see them.

2295
02:08:20,021 --> 02:08:22,150
Like you know what's going to end the
first 20 minutes when it's setting up.

2296
02:08:22,150 --> 02:08:24,300
You're like, I know you're going
to become poor. I know how to move.

2297
02:08:24,301 --> 02:08:25,810
He goes get to it already.

2298
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:29,440
I love going to a movie that's supposed
to be really good and you don't see any

2299
02:08:29,441 --> 02:08:32,130
previous four. It's rare that that
happens, but man, when it hit,

2300
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:33,490
when it does happen,
it's great.

2301
02:08:33,491 --> 02:08:36,280
It happens a lot from you now cause I
just download everything so it's like

2302
02:08:36,281 --> 02:08:39,130
there's no commercials so I can
miss commercials for things.

2303
02:08:39,310 --> 02:08:43,780
Does fucking from atheists like certainly
I'd love a good science fiction movie

2304
02:08:43,781 --> 02:08:47,080
written by, you know when you, when
you have Ridley Scott's good at home,

2305
02:08:47,081 --> 02:08:50,770
it's like come on, this is going to be
tremendous. You know, he's really good at,

2306
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:54,670
there's not enough of those. They need
like avatars every couple of months.

2307
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:57,790
You know, something along those lines.
Like something that had bad ass,

2308
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:02,770
like Taylor, one's terrible ones. Can
we for adventures. I thought, I thought,

2309
02:09:03,250 --> 02:09:06,130
I thought that maybe I was getting cynical
because I was like movies aren't good

2310
02:09:06,131 --> 02:09:07,900
anymore,
but I'm like maybe just me getting older.

2311
02:09:07,901 --> 02:09:10,510
I mean my parents had the same thing.
They looked at rotten tomatoes,

2312
02:09:10,540 --> 02:09:12,620
which is just an amalgamation of all the,
you know what it is just,

2313
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:18,350
and it was like the last nine box
office was like got shitty review.

2314
02:09:18,351 --> 02:09:22,240
It's kind of under 60% and I'm like, that
means nobody likes anything that's out.

2315
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:25,210
It's not just me. Terrible
movies, man. I know it's hard,

2316
02:09:25,211 --> 02:09:27,820
especially hard when you've got a
bunch of different people involved.

2317
02:09:27,821 --> 02:09:30,370
Think about how much money it costs
to make a movie. Like the Avengers.

2318
02:09:30,371 --> 02:09:34,870
There's fucking millions and millions
dollars on the line as far as like they

2319
02:09:34,871 --> 02:09:38,350
have to spend and then the potential
profit is millions and millions more.

2320
02:09:38,351 --> 02:09:40,990
So there's so many people with so
much saying, trying to say like,

2321
02:09:41,430 --> 02:09:43,360
don't some male naval gets done.

2322
02:09:43,610 --> 02:09:46,480
You imagine just this podcast or
the way these conversations go.

2323
02:09:46,481 --> 02:09:49,870
What if we had so many in our ear and
every time we started bringing up a

2324
02:09:49,871 --> 02:09:52,120
certain conversation you'd
like cheese it with the,

2325
02:09:52,121 --> 02:09:55,030
they're the best of the white stuff.
I'm stopping started with that.

2326
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:58,690
Ari guided the way back up on that.

2327
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:00,610
That's what it happens.
You know, like, look,

2328
02:10:00,611 --> 02:10:03,590
I've been doing the UFC for you
know how long fucking who knows.

2329
02:10:03,950 --> 02:10:07,750
Weird to have them. Nine and seven is
very rare. Does anybody say anything?

2330
02:10:07,751 --> 02:10:10,480
But once we started going
on Fox, yeah, the, the,

2331
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:12,820
the producer who actually
had to tell me in my ear,

2332
02:10:12,940 --> 02:10:15,520
the Fox executives like tell me to
take it down a notch. Come take it out.

2333
02:10:15,730 --> 02:10:18,290
Like when I get excited about something,
the way I get excited about it and then,

2334
02:10:18,291 --> 02:10:20,250
then it's, it's natural and
I'm pumping it up and I'm,

2335
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:22,900
but I'm people like I'm actually fight.
Of course they like it,

2336
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:25,800
but these fucking dummy
executives, they, the elevator.

2337
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,190
While you're not saying the Fox ones,

2338
02:10:27,191 --> 02:10:32,191
I'm saying pretty much a huge group
of the huge percentage of the group of

2339
02:10:32,651 --> 02:10:34,730
people that is in the producer

2340
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:38,650
position. A lot of them think
that their creative self did it.

2341
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:40,490
Guess what everyone's going to be exactly.

2342
02:10:40,491 --> 02:10:44,720
The most people are going
to be fewer turnover. How to
deliver the way I deliver.

2343
02:10:44,721 --> 02:10:47,630
I'm delivery. I've been doing it
forever. The like it or they don't.

2344
02:10:47,631 --> 02:10:49,490
Most people like it. If
you don't, tough shit,

2345
02:10:49,610 --> 02:10:52,640
if it doesn't sound like you're fucking
baseball guys, your basketball guys,

2346
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:55,910
it's not supposed to. You know,
it's not. It's not supposed to.

2347
02:10:55,911 --> 02:10:58,250
It's a different fucking sport
and this is just the way I do it.

2348
02:10:58,251 --> 02:11:01,040
If I was doing football, I'd
probably look you up. Disperse. Yeah.

2349
02:11:01,041 --> 02:11:05,330
You're lucky on on Chris. Well, I'm lucky
I got the job. Really. I'm lucky too,

2350
02:11:05,331 --> 02:11:09,170
but the whole idea behind
going in and like saying, oh,

2351
02:11:09,171 --> 02:11:12,680
we're going to fix all this and fix all
that. Like that's what happens in movies.

2352
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:15,050
That's what happens on TV shows.
That's what happened.

2353
02:11:15,051 --> 02:11:17,960
It would happen to this podcast
are good at hiring a lighting guy.

2354
02:11:18,440 --> 02:11:20,900
If we brought in production
people and we said,

2355
02:11:20,901 --> 02:11:22,840
we're going to move the
podcasts or studio and butter,

2356
02:11:22,910 --> 02:11:24,500
he likes you to produce this,
just sort of take,

2357
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:27,050
take some of the strain away from me.
You know, if you're having the same,

2358
02:11:27,051 --> 02:11:30,230
just talking my ear man. He says, hey
man, I'm thinking better. Take digits.

2359
02:11:30,231 --> 02:11:32,780
Change that subject. This is a
bad subject. Could you imagine?

2360
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:36,650
You imagine how fucking crazy
we would go if you know, if, if,

2361
02:11:36,651 --> 02:11:39,350
if someone like that there was no
Brian moment and someone go, hey man,

2362
02:11:39,351 --> 02:11:42,150
you guys gotta stop that.
You get your papers.

2363
02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:47,000
I commercial breaks my podcasts. I do
commercial breaks. That's so stupid.

2364
02:11:47,001 --> 02:11:49,880
It's like I'd rather just
have a conversation, you know,

2365
02:11:50,690 --> 02:11:54,950
and now we'll be right back. Well no one's
doing it well these commercials. Okay.

2366
02:11:54,951 --> 02:11:57,290
Cause you're just talking it out.
And we do get them out of the way.

2367
02:11:57,350 --> 02:12:00,800
Bill Birtles that he went on a rant for
when he did flowers.com or something.

2368
02:12:01,130 --> 02:12:02,930
He just wanted to rant of how it,
cause it was Valentine's,

2369
02:12:02,931 --> 02:12:03,601
they come and I was like,
Oh,

2370
02:12:03,601 --> 02:12:06,530
you gotta buy it girlfriend flowers
to go to [inaudible] dot com I'll get

2371
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:09,680
whatever presented goes. Well that's why
the fuck is that still a thing? Oh look,

2372
02:12:09,681 --> 02:12:13,040
they don't get any enjoyment out of it
either. The sex, we have to buy them.

2373
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:16,720
That's still, he just goes on
this tangent back like, anyway,

2374
02:12:16,730 --> 02:12:19,220
so I go to flowers.com oh that's perfect.
Yeah.

2375
02:12:19,280 --> 02:12:21,550
That's Sorta sorta how we would do it.
Yeah.

2376
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:23,140
We never really a way better way to do it.

2377
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:27,470
I'm glad he's doing it because it
gives he as a comic, he's the same.

2378
02:12:27,610 --> 02:12:28,520
The way I feel.

2379
02:12:28,521 --> 02:12:31,730
It's like you don't want to have to say
the same thing over and over again. Well,

2380
02:12:31,731 --> 02:12:32,810
you doing commercials now too.

2381
02:12:32,811 --> 02:12:35,900
How are you doing your commercials at
the beginning of the beginning I'll say

2382
02:12:35,901 --> 02:12:37,760
what the episode's about.
I'll say this stuff into it,

2383
02:12:37,761 --> 02:12:39,860
my stand up and then the sponsors.

2384
02:12:40,100 --> 02:12:42,410
But do you do elaborate
on the sponsors at all?

2385
02:12:42,411 --> 02:12:46,130
Like how are you dealing with it until
it's like Amazon dealer came Florida and

2386
02:12:46,131 --> 02:12:49,010
you and you're doing it like a,
do you do it like the way we're doing it?

2387
02:12:49,011 --> 02:12:52,210
Like you just start talking, whatever
you feel about that. I'm just like,

2388
02:12:52,220 --> 02:12:54,260
this is the deal.
He bothering people.

2389
02:12:54,261 --> 02:12:58,340
So I use to express that like I have to
hate bothering people, but like anyway,

2390
02:12:58,341 --> 02:13:00,680
this'll get me money. You know,
people have complained about it,

2391
02:13:00,681 --> 02:13:02,780
but that's just a certain percentage of
the people are going to complain about

2392
02:13:02,781 --> 02:13:04,340
anything.
I feel like they used to radio though.

2393
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:06,750
And when radio there's tons of
commercial all the time. Right?

2394
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,600
I know we're not the same thing
as we know it looks similar,

2395
02:13:08,601 --> 02:13:10,430
but it is the same thing.
It's a conversation.

2396
02:13:10,431 --> 02:13:12,320
I mean most of these people
are listening this thing,

2397
02:13:12,620 --> 02:13:15,300
they could easily be listening
to the radio. It's very simple.

2398
02:13:15,330 --> 02:13:19,160
Iphones or iPods in their cars is a
huge percentage of the people that are

2399
02:13:19,161 --> 02:13:21,830
listening to this show because
everybody has their little hookup. Now.

2400
02:13:21,831 --> 02:13:24,510
It's so easy to have a USB port every,
you know,

2401
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:26,160
most new cars like some like forwards.

2402
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:29,870
I know your car picks it up Bluetooth so
you can out of course you can stream it

2403
02:13:29,871 --> 02:13:32,010
from your phone. So you, by
the way, if you don't have

2404
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:32,701
that in your car,

2405
02:13:32,701 --> 02:13:36,870
there's something that I
recently purchased and it's
like this thing that you

2406
02:13:36,871 --> 02:13:40,380
put in your car and it's got three
speakers and you'd just goes right on your

2407
02:13:40,381 --> 02:13:45,381
visor and it automatically
connects Bluetooth Connect
to Bluetooth that once and

2408
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:50,910
uh, it can either stream music to it
and also you can take calls on it.

2409
02:13:50,911 --> 02:13:55,560
So if you don't have it in your car,
I got this for I think $129.

2410
02:13:55,910 --> 02:13:58,230
I'll put it on my website.
But it's, it's good.

2411
02:13:58,910 --> 02:14:02,340
We'll have that like a lot from like from
like a phone to the car if they have,

2412
02:14:02,370 --> 02:14:05,250
if it's a music phone. Right.
And in California it's the law.

2413
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:08,130
Like I know in Ohio you're still fucking
driving around and making phone calls,

2414
02:14:08,131 --> 02:14:12,010
but like a lot of places you can't do
that anymore. Yeah. You get tickets.

2415
02:14:12,011 --> 02:14:12,870
So people looking for people,

2416
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:16,540
well on phones, every day, text
when you shouldn't got damaged.

2417
02:14:16,550 --> 02:14:19,580
Drives me crazy when I see someone looking
down their phone while they're giant

2418
02:14:19,581 --> 02:14:24,350
metal machines hurling 60 miles an hour.
I'm like, you know, 60 miles an hour,

2419
02:14:24,351 --> 02:14:26,960
you can cover a lot of God damn
distance and a couple of seconds.

2420
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:30,170
And if you know anything about accidents,
that's how shit happens.

2421
02:14:30,171 --> 02:14:34,290
It happens like on a side. Boom.
I was, I was, uh, I was, yeah,

2422
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:35,750
last accident I heard I was drunk.

2423
02:14:36,320 --> 02:14:39,920
I was texting trying to get to the
commerce where before last call without my

2424
02:14:39,921 --> 02:14:44,480
glasses launch without your glass
at some some,

2425
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:47,400
some cab stopped and you don't expect
stop no reason. But they're hard.

2426
02:14:47,401 --> 02:14:50,260
You hit him.
I saw it last second stuffed into off,

2427
02:14:50,261 --> 02:14:53,570
it's still smashed him and then so
when a cop pulled over and was like,

2428
02:14:53,630 --> 02:14:55,160
and I was trying to get him to
wave off like no, we're good,

2429
02:14:55,161 --> 02:14:56,630
we got this covered right.

2430
02:14:56,720 --> 02:15:01,490
But it was like completely
because I looked away from
the road to cop waved off,

2431
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:04,100
I waved off the cop like he was flown
down to like, do you guys need any help?

2432
02:15:04,101 --> 02:15:06,620
But like you know, I give him a sign up.
Like we're handling this like adults,

2433
02:15:06,621 --> 02:15:10,630
we're just exchanging insurance,
hammered, panicking, sweating, heart,

2434
02:15:10,700 --> 02:15:13,100
beating your chest. Also wondering,
am I get back to the store,

2435
02:15:13,101 --> 02:15:16,550
am I going to call it a breathalyzer
sound and be able to get my set.

2436
02:15:16,670 --> 02:15:20,690
That's what happens when you drink a drug,
but texting and driving, super similar.

2437
02:15:20,700 --> 02:15:24,740
You just look away from the road. I real.
I done it a few times here and there,

2438
02:15:24,741 --> 02:15:26,120
but I do it all the time.

2439
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:29,060
You learned your lesson and you've never
done it since this accident, right?

2440
02:15:29,090 --> 02:15:32,070
Drink and drive. Yes. I
love to stay in hope show.

2441
02:15:32,071 --> 02:15:34,850
I don't know if it was before
or after and that was that one.

2442
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,100
I think that might've been the last one
because nothing happened to that one.

2443
02:15:37,160 --> 02:15:37,971
I was beyond lit up.

2444
02:15:37,971 --> 02:15:40,790
I couldn't stay to the end real
needed to get Eric's rove home.

2445
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:43,890
I drove home and I kept telling
myself that if I get to the store,

2446
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:46,100
I only live a few blocks away
from the store. If I get there,

2447
02:15:46,101 --> 02:15:48,140
I'll just pull over there and I'm like,
what are you talking about?

2448
02:15:48,141 --> 02:15:52,580
Does it make any sense? Yeah,
you're blocked. It's 95%
that's 99% of the way there.

2449
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:56,450
Dude. Why did you drive that? I was drunk
and I could not make the right decision.

2450
02:15:56,451 --> 02:15:59,820
I made the wrong decision and
luckily nothing happened. Ooh. Well,

2451
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:02,990
how hard was it to stay in the lanes?
I think a concentrated hard,

2452
02:16:02,991 --> 02:16:05,800
I managed to do it but I shouldn't. I, it
wasn't like I'm jumping, jumping forward.

2453
02:16:05,810 --> 02:16:08,660
Like I think I can handle this,
but like almost everybody has,

2454
02:16:08,720 --> 02:16:12,320
but this was not one of those times.
That's scary dude. I hate hearing that.

2455
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:16,670
Everybody out there learn from Ari. Don't
do that shit. That's a terrible thing.

2456
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:20,000
Yeah. Scary. It was control your body man.

2457
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:22,430
You'll have less control and you want
to feel like you have control but you

2458
02:16:22,431 --> 02:16:26,060
don't and you drive in a giant death
machine. Giant. That's what it is.

2459
02:16:26,900 --> 02:16:29,290
Everyone does it. Everyone drives a
little drunk. But it's like, you know,

2460
02:16:29,291 --> 02:16:30,124
you put that everyone

2461
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:34,370
does it, man. I saw a lot
of it, but it's um, it's,

2462
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:36,430
it's certainly a fucking problem.
I remember in high school though,

2463
02:16:36,431 --> 02:16:38,830
I used to have like a note,
like one drink and I'm done rule.

2464
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:41,950
I don't know if you guys had that with
that one right way. No, I have had those,

2465
02:16:42,190 --> 02:16:45,650
especially if I'm driving, if I'm doing a
show that really can have a beer, maybe,

2466
02:16:45,651 --> 02:16:48,430
maybe two beers on stage,
but if I know I got to drive afterwards,

2467
02:16:48,480 --> 02:16:51,220
it's the worst feeling in the
world and you've got to sober up.

2468
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:55,270
But Sam Kinison said it the best.
Well, you can't leave your car there.

2469
02:16:55,660 --> 02:16:58,660
How are you gonna get your car home like
that? Something like that. Toad. Yeah.

2470
02:16:58,690 --> 02:17:00,820
That's not realistic for most people know.
Most people.

2471
02:17:00,821 --> 02:17:03,970
It's not Vancouver [inaudible]
of all Canada. Vancouver,

2472
02:17:03,971 --> 02:17:07,330
at least they have super strict laws
so people just don't do it. Yeah.

2473
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:10,390
I think that's one of the great things
about living in New York city that

2474
02:17:10,391 --> 02:17:13,540
everybody's just hiring cabs,
captain, subway, cab, subway.

2475
02:17:13,541 --> 02:17:16,500
You don't have to be responsible
for being hammered. Yeah.

2476
02:17:17,050 --> 02:17:18,610
But then you have to
live in New York City,

2477
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:24,730
which I don't think I'm willing to do.
We've got to be there.

2478
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:28,470
We're going to be a in New York
in May. Right. When is it Brian?

2479
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:33,370
[inaudible] fourth. May 4th. Yeah.
Um, but the big the most, oh,

2480
02:17:33,371 --> 02:17:35,680

club too. Are you going to do it?

2481
02:17:35,870 --> 02:17:38,980
Maybe it just do Friday. Okay. What
night you want to do Friday night? Yeah.

2482
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:43,810
Which show bull shows look, that's how
quick we roll. There's a gentleman,

2483
02:17:43,811 --> 02:17:47,560
that's what we make decisions. And
Saturday a little Esther doesn't know yet,

2484
02:17:47,561 --> 02:17:51,120
but I'm gonna ask her to do
it with a me and a docket.

2485
02:17:51,130 --> 02:17:53,890
So you're going to do just Friday?
Yeah. A little Lester in Dunkin fry.

2486
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:55,950
So Ari and and,

2487
02:17:55,951 --> 02:17:59,500

Esther if she wants to do it.

2488
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:02,590
And Dunkin on Saturday this weekend.
Comedy Magic Club.

2489
02:18:02,680 --> 02:18:05,710
But the big one had saw for 20 in Atlanta.
That's my fucking special.

2490
02:18:05,711 --> 02:18:08,740
I'm taping it. This is the best
shit I've ever had. This is,

2491
02:18:08,741 --> 02:18:11,470
I could have taped a special a year ago.
You were ready a long time ago.

2492
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:15,160
I'm fucked. I've never been
this black. I've got like,

2493
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,270
I did an hour and 40 minutes the other
night and it was just all material really

2494
02:18:19,660 --> 02:18:22,120
just all look. Yeah, I
got a lot of shit. I went,

2495
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:24,610
I went through all of it
and I don't think I still,

2496
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:25,960
I still don't think I did everything.

2497
02:18:25,961 --> 02:18:27,430
I still have some other
stuff that I have to,

2498
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:30,950
that I've written down that I liked
sort of abandoned along the way.

2499
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:33,890
And I have to figure out where to put
certain things I want to try to get to.

2500
02:18:33,910 --> 02:18:36,020
It's like if he didn't get back to
it, it's like, okay, I didn't, I'll,

2501
02:18:36,021 --> 02:18:38,930
maybe I'll just start from here. From,
you know, for the next tier. Yeah. Yeah.

2502
02:18:38,950 --> 02:18:40,870
Like this never got good.
Yeah. There's some bits. Well,

2503
02:18:40,871 --> 02:18:44,410
there's some bits I can't keep doing. It
was just done with, I'm sick of it, right?

2504
02:18:44,411 --> 02:18:47,410
Yeah. I got to get rid of him. Even if I
don't, they don't make it to the special.

2505
02:18:47,411 --> 02:18:48,244
I'm getting rid of them,

2506
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:50,810
but just holding you back creatively
after a certain amount of time there.

2507
02:18:51,970 --> 02:18:54,750
So April 20th at the Tabernacle.
Say It,

2508
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:59,290
Brian Tabernac bowl habitat.
I have to tell [inaudible] how about,

2509
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:02,100
how about angle in Atlanta? So,
uh, she moved up three dates,

2510
02:19:03,490 --> 02:19:07,240
Vancouver 29th through the
31st the comedy mix. Ooh,

2511
02:19:07,270 --> 02:19:10,480
one of the best clubs in the world.
Yeah. It has a big show. When was that?

2512
02:19:10,481 --> 02:19:11,600
April one no,

2513
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:16,620
March 29th 30 31st March 29th through
the 31st comedy mixed in Vancouver.

2514
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:19,620
Ari Shaffir who you
working with? Um, I dunno.

2515
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:23,170
They're going to give me someone there.
They've got a good local scene. Yeah,

2516
02:19:23,171 --> 02:19:25,750
I think so. Yeah. There's a lot of
good comics. We were up there, um,

2517
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:28,100
me and Gloria did sets there
last time we were there

2518
02:19:28,470 --> 02:19:30,170
and they had a great local scene,

2519
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:33,370
which a lot of funny comics like
facility anywhere. West Coast. Yeah.

2520
02:19:33,550 --> 02:19:37,130
The Vancouver is awesome. It's one of the
greatest cities in the world. The wins,

2521
02:19:37,131 --> 02:19:40,700
like greatest city in the world all the
time. It's like friendly and worldly.

2522
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:43,250
It's beautiful. It's west coast
that all chill back and laid back.

2523
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:46,340
Food's incredible. Some of the
best restaurants. Jesus Christ.

2524
02:19:46,341 --> 02:19:50,480
We've had some incredible stakes at that
place. Yeah, I eman is amazing. That's,

2525
02:19:50,530 --> 02:19:52,670
that's how, that's one of my
favorite places to go ever.

2526
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:57,940
So you're there March 29th 31st
31st and that comedy mix is the,

2527
02:19:58,670 --> 02:20:02,420
the downstairs of a hotel. Yeah. That's
the old Yaki. Yeah, we did once a long,

2528
02:20:02,421 --> 02:20:04,400
long time. Yeah. It's a great spot.

2529
02:20:04,430 --> 02:20:07,190
It's a perfect size to like the area
of downtown, wherever it goes out.

2530
02:20:07,220 --> 02:20:11,120
It's like two blocks away to a perfect
sized club. A place is amazing.

2531
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:13,180
Yeah.
And then I think I'm doing an album.

2532
02:20:15,060 --> 02:20:16,690
I think I got to try this
again to take that thing.

2533
02:20:16,900 --> 02:20:19,860
So the first one didn't work out? No,
they just didn't get there in time.

2534
02:20:19,861 --> 02:20:22,030
They just fucked up the recording too
much. I didn't want to do it wrong.

2535
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:26,650
What'd they do? They missed the first
three days. Why? They just didn't come.

2536
02:20:26,710 --> 02:20:31,350
Why not? They weren't, they
weren't organized. So they
were supposed to be there.

2537
02:20:31,370 --> 02:20:33,790
They never got there.
Yeah. Well who is this?

2538
02:20:33,880 --> 02:20:37,140
I don't know if I should say or not
say, but it was just delicious. No,

2539
02:20:37,150 --> 02:20:38,090
they were like, you wanna
do it again. I'm like,

2540
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:40,890
I think I'm going to go and do it on my
own. I don't want to try this again. What?

2541
02:20:40,891 --> 02:20:43,360
That was really frustrating. They weren't
there Wednesday weren't the Thursday.

2542
02:20:43,570 --> 02:20:45,190
Oh, and you're killing. Yeah.

2543
02:20:45,220 --> 02:20:48,820
And Thursday was a super like
conservative crowd and Edmonton. But they,

2544
02:20:48,940 --> 02:20:51,940
they laughed super hard. It all the
cleaner jokes. Right. And I was like,

2545
02:20:51,970 --> 02:20:54,680
that's the best reaction. That was
clean jokes I've ever gotten. Right.

2546
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:56,260
Like I would have liked
to have had that down.

2547
02:20:57,040 --> 02:20:59,230
And then Friday they sent somebody down,
but he's the system.

2548
02:20:59,231 --> 02:21:01,630
And then Saturday there was all
this feedback from the soda machine.

2549
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:06,490
Oh No, they just couldn't
use two full bits. And I was
like, I want the hum. Yeah.

2550
02:21:06,491 --> 02:21:09,700
That shit's annoying. It's hard to
fucking get, get a, a special down.

2551
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:14,410
There's a lot of pressure to just have
that moment be just like a real show.

2552
02:21:14,650 --> 02:21:17,530
Yeah. So that's why I'm doing a
lot of shows between now and then.

2553
02:21:17,531 --> 02:21:20,380
If you see me like adding shows,
that's exactly what's going on.

2554
02:21:20,381 --> 02:21:24,730
That's trying to get ready. Yeah. That's
why I'm doing, that's why I'm dealing, uh,

2555
02:21:24,760 --> 02:21:29,500
Hollywood of doing the Improv.
April 13th, 14th and 15th,

2556
02:21:29,560 --> 02:21:34,500
the Hollywood Calif, not California
rather, um, Hollywood, Lauren, Laura,

2557
02:21:34,510 --> 02:21:38,200
Florida. The uh, the one at the hard
rock. So that's a April 13th, 14th,

2558
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:42,240
and then the 20th Atlantic. Oh,
in Louisiana we're doing, um,

2559
02:21:42,580 --> 02:21:44,650
the Improv in,
uh,

2560
02:21:44,710 --> 02:21:49,580
in Louisiana and Louisiana Improv in
Louisville, Kentucky. Say Louisiana.

2561
02:21:50,770 --> 02:21:55,770
Jesus Christ who don't have the living
talk tab or an ten one ml 33 30,

2562
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:02,680
uh, March 30th through April 1st
we're at the Louisville, Louisville,

2563
02:22:02,681 --> 02:22:06,580
Kentucky Improv, Ken and get like right
and groove. I'm just trying to get,

2564
02:22:06,581 --> 02:22:09,370
I'm just, I'm getting up like crazy.
I'm just going to get up every weekend,

2565
02:22:09,371 --> 02:22:13,470
all week, everywhere. There's kind of
just banging out and listening to sets,

2566
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:16,960
doing a lot of writing too. And I'm,
I'm also preparing for the next stuff,

2567
02:22:16,961 --> 02:22:21,700
so I'm sandwiching in new bits and I
find that when I do that I make my older

2568
02:22:21,701 --> 02:22:23,110
bits better anyway.
I'm just,

2569
02:22:23,290 --> 02:22:26,060
it makes my whole set better
when I'm new shit and had

2570
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:28,890
a friend ask him about this. It goes
sometimes like store. He was like,

2571
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:32,040
sometimes I feel like if I do this whole
bits I make them longer and like add

2572
02:22:32,041 --> 02:22:35,520
stuff to them. Yeah. But my, my theory
with that is you would that new stuff,

2573
02:22:35,521 --> 02:22:37,920
that new creative stuff that you put into
that you would put into the other new

2574
02:22:37,921 --> 02:22:42,060
bit. Yeah. Can you just make
your other bits better? It
is both. I think did a bit,

2575
02:22:42,180 --> 02:22:45,300
can cook for a certain amount of time.
Then after a while it's done. It's done.

2576
02:22:45,330 --> 02:22:48,800
Sometimes it's not done and you'll like
a year into this bit, you know, like you,

2577
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:54,020
but then in the next year you'll come
up with all this great new shit to go

2578
02:22:54,151 --> 02:22:57,000
along with it and now it becomes like
a real piece that you're proud of it.

2579
02:22:57,010 --> 02:22:59,880
Then you can let it go. It's all, I'm
like knowing when to let it go. You know?

2580
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:03,720
It's hard. Yeah. Friday
I'll be at the ice house,

2581
02:23:03,730 --> 02:23:07,680
but Joey Diaz and Doug Benson for
the ice house chronicles. Yeah.

2582
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:09,990

chronicles by the way,

2583
02:23:09,991 --> 02:23:14,470
