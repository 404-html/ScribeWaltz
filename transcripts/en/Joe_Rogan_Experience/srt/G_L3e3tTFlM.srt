1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,231
Okay.

3
00:00:03,231 --> 00:00:05,630
Do they have a list of enhanced
breath for a woman's MMA?

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,113
Um,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,033
no.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,870
That's,

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,860
I'll need to ask somebody.

8
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:14,191
This is,

9
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:15,440
this is too long of a Google search.

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,540
I need to call up a big
John McCarthy or um,

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,411
yeah,

12
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:19,890
you can't,

13
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,820
can't kick the ball,

14
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,260
but you can grab it.

15
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:22,861
It's just weird.

16
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:27,861
Like you guys grab that black guys do
what they call oil check excuse when oil

17
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:30,150
check is sometimes in the
middle of the grappling.

18
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,400
The guy will literally have his
fingers deep into guys asshole.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,050
Just digging in there and you know,

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,790
it forces the guy to move,

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,910
forced to got to move in a way
to get away from that grip.

22
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:42,811
And I don't see,

23
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:43,620
I don't think it's in,

24
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,580
I don't think it's illegal.

25
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:45,031
It's not,

26
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:46,620
I don't think it's illegal
in wrestling either.

27
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,870
I wouldn't start making MMA butt plugs.

28
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:49,741
No,

29
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,870
that would just shove something deeper
in your ass and you have to have like a

30
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,790
protection.

31
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,530
But what if you don't know a flat?

32
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:55,931
Well,

33
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,700
the problem is you need
movement like you're to,

34
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,970
you're asking us to be able to move.

35
00:00:59,971 --> 00:01:04,230
So anything that you do that would
like protect your ass hole would be

36
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,020
restrictive.

37
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:05,581
It would be like,

38
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,920
it would restrict your ability
to move left and right.

39
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:09,060
It would be a messenger boy.

40
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:09,420
Yeah.

41
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:09,571
Yeah.

42
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,750
It would mess with your
athleticism to our oil checks.

43
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,703
Legal.

44
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,863
What if it's like,

45
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,131
like this though,

46
00:01:16,131 --> 00:01:19,820
like if it's as a flat center.

47
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:20,061
Dot.

48
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:20,540
Bam.

49
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:20,781
No,

50
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:21,614
that's

51
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,591
things in your ass.

52
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:24,610
So I need to find out if this is all.

53
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,320
So what about,

54
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:25,560
well,

55
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:25,910
Nah,

56
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,190
I've got to go to the
bathroom and here's that.

57
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:29,680
Here's the one where he's checked.

58
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,380
Yeah.

59
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,580
Dudes do this all the time.

60
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,830
Chris Tufts is NC.

61
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,030
So I was on camera and says,

62
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:37,840
oops,

63
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,673
wait.

64
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,203
He says,

65
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:41,560
oh look,

66
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,150
he even said something on the end of it.

67
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,011
Um,

68
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,060
one guy,

69
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,340
uh,

70
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,440
actually got a rape charge
from a wrestling match.

71
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,070
Apparently.

72
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,730
What,

73
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,563
when was this?

74
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,370
17 year old Jerome hunt faces 21
counts of rape and attempted rape.

75
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,970
Each count carries with him
up to 25 years in prison.

76
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,170
Hunt's lawyer,

77
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:06,000
Mike Butler crank claims that complaints
came from fellow Parker wrestlers who

78
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,480
were simply victims of a
legitimate wrestling move bottler.

79
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:13,260
Just file a motion to move the case of
juvenile court on that court document.

80
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,620
He lays out a lot of information
presented to the grand jury before they

81
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,550
indicted hunt on the rape charges while
he's indicted on the rape charges.

82
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,403
Wow.

83
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
Former state champion wrestler,

84
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,230
Jerome Hunt's lawyer says that all but
two of the incidents reported happened in

85
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,370
the Parker high school wrestling room
before the practice during last year's

86
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:33,091
wrestling session.

87
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,350
Before practice.

88
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,270
Before practice.

89
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,530
Before practice rape.

90
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:37,951
Yeah.

91
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:41,550
It possibly came from a wrestling
move called a but drag or skinning.

92
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,091
Okay.

93
00:02:42,091 --> 00:02:43,290
Before practice,

94
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,153
what is that?

95
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,570
Dragging before practice,

96
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,900
it's not something illegal
or not being taught.

97
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,560
It's being taught all over one accuser
even testified to a grand jury.

98
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,330
I didn't take it as a sexual move.

99
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,240
I took it as him just messing around.

100
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,400
La Who?

101
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,850
Who charged then a prude.

102
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
Hmm.

103
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,520
This is interesting because that is the
oil check is like a legitimate wrestling

104
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,170
move if that's what he's doing.

105
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,950
It's like people have been doing whether
or not you think they should be able to

106
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,281
do that.

107
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,750
I don't think they should
be able to do that.

108
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,500
But people have been doing
that for a long time.

109
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
Like in actual legitimate wrestling,

110
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,111
like bill,

111
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,760
look up oil check wrestling,

112
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,290
find a video for oil check wrestling
because that's something that guys have

113
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,330
done like for a long ass time.

114
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:28,571
I mean,

115
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,940
I would even say that's
like gladiator days.

116
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:32,390
I'm sure they did that well.

117
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,390
It's not the most effective
way to control a person.

118
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:38,650
So it's not like something that someone
does for a long time or on a regular

119
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,400
basis.

120
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,800
It's just when you're in a
wrestling match with someone,

121
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:43,030
what you're trying to do is win.

122
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,490
And if you spend time fingerings,

123
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
but you could've been doing other things
that would actually get you to win the

124
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,251
match.

125
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:50,440
So it's not like something
that comes up all the time.

126
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah,

127
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,490
I call that a Friday.

128
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,150
But,

129
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:54,910
um,

130
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,140
some people,

131
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,153
uh,

132
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,731
you know,

133
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,410
some people who don't know wrestling,

134
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:03,220
who found out that this guy's
oil checking people and you know,

135
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:04,480
maybe being a dick about it.

136
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:05,860
Hey,

137
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,260
Johnny's oil check and people no,

138
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:08,531
fine.

139
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,000
Just what is this?

140
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:10,771
No,

141
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:10,900
no,

142
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,051
no,

143
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:11,201
no.

144
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,430
Not checking the oil crisis.

145
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,480
Oil check,

146
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,280
image oil check,

147
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,791
wrestling,

148
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:16,624
checking.

149
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,330
Just listening to Google
oil check wrestling.

150
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:19,661
Yeah.

151
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,494
I got some right here.

152
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,790
That was about it though.

153
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,770
I'm going to drag you so you ain't safe.

154
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,633
Yeah.

155
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,150
Yes.

156
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,983
He

157
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,660
totally legal.

158
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,930
See how he's doing this and the referee's
not getting angry at him and no one's

159
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:42,764
going to jail.

160
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,611
See this is,

161
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,590
it is actually a legal wrestling move.

162
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,060
That guy putting his hands in.

163
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:47,811
That guy's an asshole.

164
00:04:47,811 --> 00:04:49,670
Like that is totally legal.

165
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,290
Not only is it totally legal,

166
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,060
it's so common.

167
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,400
Who made this video?

168
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,234
Like who,

169
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,021
who is like,

170
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,030
you know what I'm going to do today?

171
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,610
Like I said,

172
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,960
it's common,

173
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:02,060
but it's not the most common thing.

174
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,270
Like wrestling is all about.

175
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:05,981
Yes,

176
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:06,670
it makes sense.

177
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,130
It's not the best way to control
a guy all the time though.

178
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:10,480
So when it does come up,

179
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,081
guys do it,

180
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:15,520
but it's not like the only way to
do it and it's not like if you,

181
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,310
if you concentrate on that when
you should be doing something else,

182
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,570
you're going to lose the wrestling match.

183
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,230
So it's not,

184
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,620
he's,

185
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,270
what he's doing is using it as a whole.

186
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,870
He's literally trying to grapple
by holding onto the guy like that.

187
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,670
He's not necessarily,

188
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,620
he might be sexual or you might also be
trying to inflict pain and discomfort,

189
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,600
but it's been going on forever.

190
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,130
Oh those damn oil checkers.

191
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,430
So take this one kid and
calm a rapist for that stuff.

192
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,780
But the other thing was then
said Doris before practice.

193
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,170
That's a problem like that before
practice that that disturbs me.

194
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:47,741
Like wait a minute,

195
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:47,991
wait minute,

196
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:48,760
wait a minute.

197
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,260
Like hours before practice,

198
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:54,400
like five minutes before practice where
you're warming up like in the locker

199
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:54,551
room.

200
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,710
Like hey check this out.

201
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,430
You're going over techniques
like what exact exact,

202
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,790
what exactly is going on and how many
counts did say like was it just one

203
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,161
person?

204
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,980
I think they said like 40 Jesus.

205
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,730
Yeah,

206
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,840
it's 40 people.

207
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,690
40 40 churches while I'll read it again.

208
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,080
Well,

209
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,790
I shouldn't talk about this kid,

210
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,241
and by the way,

211
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:13,370
this was a several years ago,

212
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,320
2006 actually,

213
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,780
but I'm 21 counts.

214
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,440
Wow.

215
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,273
Yeah.

216
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:19,941
That if,

217
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:20,900
if you know,

218
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,920
I don't know what that kid did,

219
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,120
so I'm just talking out of my ass.

220
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,070
But if the kid did what's in those videos,

221
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,880
you better go watch those videos because
there's videos of people doing that,

222
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,370
but drag or oil check forever.

223
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,980
It's been going on for as
long as he's been wrestling.

224
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,710
It's just not the most
effective thing to do always.

225
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,880
It's not in every match,

226
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,051
but shit,

227
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,040
it's pretty fucking common.

228
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,880
Yeah.

229
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,713
You know,

230
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,790
and then they put plugs.

231
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,751
That doesn't help,

232
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,470
dude.

233
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,251
Stupid idea.

234
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,990
It's just going to go
deeper in and you bleed.

235
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,810
It's not going to stop the
guy from holding onto it.

236
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,060
I get a little tail on the end.

237
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,630
Yeah,

238
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,660
it's got good idea.

239
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,590
Make it a decorative,

240
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:56,600
but pull that out and the
guy gets embarrassing.

241
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,434
It's happened.

242
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,860
Comes out of a loud pop pop.

243
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:01,671
It's like,

244
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,301
sorry about that.

245
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,740
A tech could take that.

246
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:04,960
Yeah.

247
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,210
Hello.

248
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,750
This man.

249
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,500
Did I hear that?

250
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,070
Um,

251
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,150
Brock Lesnar's thinking
about coming back to the UFC.

252
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,311
Yeah,

253
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,144
it's bullshit.

254
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,641
Yeah,

255
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,474
that's bullshit.

256
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,030
They,

257
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,580
there's one hype story when they were
trying to hype it up because the WWE was

258
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:19,460
saying that Brock Lesnar was in Vegas
and they may might've big announcement,

259
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,120
but it's really just a publicity move
to talk about Brock Lesnar's wrestling

260
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:23,954
appearance.

261
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,790
So there was a little bit of hype on that.

262
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,080
Some guys tweeting me that the,

263
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,790
but drag just not go into the butthole.

264
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,180
Um,

265
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:29,901
yes it does,

266
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:30,530
sir.

267
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,520
Sometimes the,

268
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:33,080
but track does not go into that.

269
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,020
They're saying it's a,

270
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,720
there's a nerve back there pulling.

271
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,050
Yeah,

272
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,800
you're right.

273
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,140
But tell me the dude's don't sometimes
put fingers in people's assholes.

274
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,760
Hey,

275
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,110
if I can for sure dude,

276
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:43,100
cause I've had it happen.

277
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,360
So shut your mouth.

278
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,800
If I had to tell me,

279
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,770
don't tell me that oil checks
don't go in your asshole.

280
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,700
I've had it happen.

281
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,181
Sneaky,

282
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,230
creepy fingers.

283
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,641
Do's,

284
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:53,920
oil drag you under ground on
a graph you're going to like,

285
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,610
just rub it like around,

286
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,211
you know it's,

287
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:57,030
there you go,

288
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,863
you go in.

289
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,000
It's not like,

290
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,151
oh,

291
00:07:59,151 --> 00:07:59,720
I'm sorry.

292
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,790
There's different people.

293
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,111
Look at this.

294
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:03,260
This is a nice one right there.

295
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,143
That's like,

296
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:04,960
yeah,

297
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,793
that's

298
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,890
definitely that.

299
00:08:07,891 --> 00:08:08,330
Those women,

300
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:08,961
is that Bobby Lee?

301
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:09,201
Yes.

302
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:10,034
It's a woman.

303
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,093
There's a woman.

304
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,290
There might be Felicia.

305
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,561
Oh,

306
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:13,430
I don't know who that is.

307
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,720
It might be my friend Felicia.

308
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,500
She's a Badass.

309
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,550
Grappler know is not right.

310
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,331
These are the,

311
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:20,720
uh,

312
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,620
that guy's an asshole.

313
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,200
Yeah.

314
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,940
That,

315
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,700
that's the oil wrestling that
like Russian oil respill Turkish.

316
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,300
Turkish over Jesus Christ.

317
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:30,710
Yeah.

318
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,290
Anybody who says it doesn't
go in your asshole shut it.

319
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,630
He's clearly looking at
that and just being like,

320
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:35,861
yeah,

321
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:36,694
you fucking,

322
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,461
well,

323
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,180
you know,

324
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,440
it doesn't always go in.

325
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:42,140
Sometimes it just hits the tank sometimes.

326
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:42,410
Uh,

327
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:43,900
it's just the guy that
hurt that would hurt.

328
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,890
Got a good grip on the upper deck.

329
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,950
It doesn't actually get in the asshole.

330
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,610
He's just pulling the lid up,

331
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,910
pulling the lit up on the
macaroni and cheese containers.

332
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,130
Just get the steam out.

333
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,741
Yeah,

334
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,630
just Tupperware in that motherfucker.

335
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,870
But sometimes it goes in the asshole.

336
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,050
There's a lot of fucking
butthurt wrestling guys out
there that are arguing with

337
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:04,980
me right now on Twitter.

338
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,420
We just showed you photos,

339
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:06,960
you fox,

340
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,620
you're in denial and there's a lot of
guys who have had their assholes finger

341
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:11,010
who were like,

342
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,810
thank you Joe for speaking up.

343
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,570
This bullshit did even go.

344
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,990
It can't go in,

345
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,680
dude.

346
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,670
It's a trap.

347
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,650
My ass holes like a bank vault.

348
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,770
Nothing's getting.

349
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,860
Then you might be knocking on the door,

350
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,880
but you can knock on my door.

351
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,110
Does that mean you sleep in my house?

352
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,351
No,

353
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:26,580
it does not mean you sleep in my house.

354
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:27,480
You're just knocking on my door.

355
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,260
You can't get in.

356
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,070
I think it's time.

357
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,870
If you have had your butthole invaded
by finger to come out and sows the brown

358
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:34,321
stuff,

359
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,340
fish of security,

360
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,073
nothing.

361
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,490
Nothing gets through.

362
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,324
It's tight.

363
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,070
It's like,

364
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,320
like that fucking went event horizon when,

365
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,540
when it opened up the time
for favorite scary movie ever.

366
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,820
That's my favorite
scary movie of all time.

367
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:48,870
I'm so glad you said that.

368
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:49,351
Fucking good,

369
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:50,070
scary,

370
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,060
terrifying movie.

371
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,170
Yeah.

372
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,760
The idea that they run into hell,

373
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,220
whoo.

374
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,520
Going through enough.

375
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,880
Brian,

376
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,720
he nef,

377
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:58,680
e.

378
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,000
N.

379
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
U.

380
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
F.

381
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,030
F.

382
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,820
What are you showing more guys
with hands up dude's ass holes.

383
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:04,290
I think we get it right.

384
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,521
It happens.

385
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,660
Wrestling fans.

386
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:09,240
I know you don't like
to believe it happens,

387
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,320
but it happens.

388
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,561
Oh yeah,

389
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:11,490
that was real too.

390
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,223
It's all real.

391
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,783
That's different.

392
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,780
That's just two men standing their ground
with their lips locked and trying to

393
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,500
gain an advantage.

394
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,900
Making Valentine's Day plan.

395
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:25,231
By the way,

396
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:25,651
that White Guy,

397
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:30,651
one white guy won that one as much to
dismay if black people everywhere I should

398
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:31,030
have,

399
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,800
but check them much to dismay
of Anderson Silva fans,

400
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,170
much to dismay of people don't like
wrestling or Buczek's oil checks drags,

401
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,831
but tracks.

402
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:44,190
I'm sure Chris Weidman has been
oil checked some time in his life.

403
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,740
Last name like Weidman is how
you make an animal like that.

404
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,903
Why?

405
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,630
Why?

406
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,710
How dare you?

407
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,190
How dare you?

408
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,530
What is this a parody?

409
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,630
Can we play your parody video?

410
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:57,840
What is it?

411
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,100
It's called not looking.

412
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,140
Not Looking.

413
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,840
Yeah.

414
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,411
That's fake.

415
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,310
Brian Stout.

416
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:03,421
What?

417
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,890
Jesus find believes everything.

418
00:11:04,891 --> 00:11:05,670
Twin Towers.

419
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,140
Fucking black helicopters.

420
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,213
That Shit's naked.

421
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:09,700
Okay.
