00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,050
Hello Freak bitches.
And,

2
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:07,830
and interestingly after that,
the way I dealt with coming out was I

3
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:11,310
would tell someone and then I would get
this little burst of feeling better.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,070
I would suddenly cause you,
I was like constricting my heart.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,070
And when I would tell someone it would,
it would open up a little and I'd feel

6
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:19,320
better and I could,
I really could feel like I could breathe

7
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:20,880
better,
like really felt better.

8
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,330
And then I would wait until that
pressure would start building again.

9
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:27,720
Sometimes I would wait months and then I
would tell someone and then I would do

10
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,960
this over the course of like two years.
And then eventually I realized,

11
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:31,471
I was like,
you know,

12
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,890
every time I tell somebody this thing
that I think is horrible and they're

13
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,590
pretty much okay and I feel better,
I was like,

14
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:39,810
I got to end this,
it's time to end this now.

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,760
And that's,
that's basically when I told the

16
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:43,310
remaining people.
And um,

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,830
that was it.
It's a weird secret because the people

18
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,800
that do care that don't like it,
they're not worth knowing.

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,600
And nobody,
literally nobody,

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,490
nobody that I told,
you know,

21
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,530
my dad struggled for a little bit or you
know,

22
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:56,460
whatever.
This and that.

23
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:58,920
My a lot,
the thing that mostly people got was

24
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:01,830
that nobody believed I was gay.
That was like my mate.

25
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,310
Did you play basketball?
You play basketball,

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,960
you know,
like that.

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,600
So nobody could believe like they just,
well you don't seem gay.

28
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:13,610
Like I don't like to dance.
I don't ks dancing.

29
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,160
I learned my dancing from cosby.
Like that's my move,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,980
you know?
So all of that like,

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,530
so that was the main thing.
Everyone was just sideswiped.

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,270
So a lot of times people will say to me,
you know,

33
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,710
you're,
you act straight or you're straight

34
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,630
acting or saying,
which in the gay community has thought

35
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:28,860
of,
it's like this great thing,

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,371
you know,
they're,

37
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,930
if you're straight acting your
masculine,

38
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,860
it's really great.

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,920
But I don't,
I don't take it that way because every

40
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:37,200
time someone says it to me,
it makes me feel like a freak.

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,910
You know what I mean?
Like why am I,

42
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,250
yeah,
because I am who I am.

43
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:42,810
This is it.
You know what I mean?

44
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,170
Like,
like I had gay sex last night after I

45
00:01:46,171 --> 00:01:48,390
had that grass fed beef,
you know?

46
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:51,270
And so I'm gay.
I'm married to a guy there.

47
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:54,360
It sounds like a gay person,
but that's a pretty gay married to a

48
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:54,930
guy.
I would say.

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,220
Again,
that's pretty gay.

50
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,510
That's what I realized.
I was like,

51
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,350
Oh,
I'm marrying this dude.

52
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,440
Like I guess,
but you know what I mean?

53
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,360
Like I was like,
Holy Shit.

54
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,670
Like I guess,
well,

55
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:05,820
you know,
turn it back now.

56
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,683
Yeah.
Um,

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,120
it was a phase.
Yeah,

58
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:10,800
this is a long face.
I'm really like,

59
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,840
you know,
it's dragging out this phase thing.

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,100
But I realized that,
that if I felt better when I told people

61
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,740
that,
that there had to be some value in that

62
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,510
in a way that I couldn't understand
things.

63
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,470
Right.
But to the,

64
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,190
to the straight acting like I don't,
it means nothing to me when I meet guys

65
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:30,540
that are completely flaming or if I meet
guys that are that you'd have no idea.

66
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:35,130
Like I like people based on their values
and their sense of humor and like shit

67
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,350
like that.
I never asked to wall people that matter

68
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,970
as as yeah.
And you know what,

69
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:42,540
that sort of a great way to bring this
all around because that gets away from

70
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:45,450
judging people on what you're supposed
to think about them and all that social

71
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:49,800
justice warrior and regressive bullshit
versus judging people on the content of

72
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,870
their character.
It was the highlight of my,

73
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,550
uh,
training as a person.

74
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,180
There was,
um,

75
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,300
training George for those two weeks and
the first three days that I was with

76
00:02:57,301 --> 00:03:01,390
him,
it was so mind blowing that how famous

77
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,980
he was.
People were coming up,

78
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,600
morning taken photos we were eating.
And then after the third day,

79
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,850
fourth day fee,
then you realize this thing,

80
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,740
this,
the machine doesn't turn off.

81
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,210
And then,
um,

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,330
he can't go to the chemist to buy
shampoo.

83
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:18,040
He can't just,
uh,

84
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,050
let's call
called the cameras.

85
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,240
Like,
where the fuck are you getting your

86
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,074
champion?

87
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,350
He might go,
he might go into the toilets to pass

88
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:34,840
stool and you got people waiting at the
side of the cubicle to wait to get a

89
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,070
photo with him.
So He's,

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,110
and then we've got to,
every time we went somewhere,

91
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:39,850
I'd always have to be through the VIP
entrance.

92
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,080
He couldn't walked through the front
door,

93
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,690
uh,
especially in Montreal.

94
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,380
So one time we went to a nightclub and
then we've got an in through the VIP and

95
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:48,850
then we'll,
we'll walk into our,

96
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,150
uh,
our table and then we're about maybe 15

97
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:55,410
feet from their table and someone said,
Jews Birger as p.

98
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,950
And we had a word of a lie.
The whole dance floor stopped dancing.

99
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,390
Everyone's looked at us turn and the
whole club's walk towards that table.

100
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,110
And,
um,

101
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,070
without losing a beat,
we've turned straight back around and

102
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:10,600
walked straight back out and like club
because,

103
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:13,740
uh,
it was like a tsunami of fans that had

104
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,880
just come into real sit down.

105
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:16,521
He said,
oh,

106
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,610
we'll come back here in a couple of
years later when the,

107
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:20,610
when the distracted,
um,

108
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,310
I can't come in right now because it's
like this every day is,

109
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:25,390
this doesn't,
yeah,

110
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,130
this is,
this is normal.

111
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,980
And he's,
he has,

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,290
he's a good friends that he's our age,
body guards that stand around in the

113
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:33,270
whole time because,
uh,

114
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,431
uh,
people say,

115
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,820
can I get a photo?
And the body guys will step in and say,

116
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,780
oh no,
no,

117
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,280
flashy.
As soon as the flash goes off,

118
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,250
then the whole club's going to come.
And then George will say yes.

119
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,301
And then the body goes,
oh,

120
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,780
sorry.
Harbor George says,

121
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,200
look,
you don't understand if the camera goes

122
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,040
in,
we've got a problem and everybody's want

123
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,430
photo essay in end.
Even at a red light,

124
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,620
we're driving in the car.
Me and George got the radio on,

125
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,140
big jar.
We stopped,

126
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,450
we stopped at a red light and all you
hear is GSP,

127
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,840
GSP and four tees credit,
a champion.

128
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:07,480
He is,
he always looks way smalls and then

129
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,730
certainly just juice for just a
fraction,

130
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:11,400
just so he's had our eyesight of,
of,

131
00:05:11,401 --> 00:05:13,180
of the fans.
But it's,

132
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:14,350
um,
but that's everyone.

133
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,700
Every single,
he'd rather from your car park even he'd

134
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:23,650
catch a taxi from the front gate to the
back gate because it from walking a

135
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,170
hundred feet would be a half an hour.
Um,

136
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,990
would photos and handshakes and high
fives.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,370
And

138
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,570
I was doing this,
uh,

139
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,600
this film project thing in Alaska and I
tracked down this guy that killed the

140
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,950
Kodiak bear with a knife.
Buck knife.

141
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,150
What?
Yeah,

142
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,090
it was crazy story.
Old older guy too.

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,090
His name was Jeanne Moe.
There's been a ton of articles written

144
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,130
about it and like outdoor life.
And if this was back,

145
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,090
it wasn't that long ago,
but I can't really put the knife in a

146
00:05:54,091 --> 00:05:58,240
musket.
I mean you're these bear stories and I

147
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,750
was just like,
I'm going to tracking down some of these

148
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:03,290
barriers during this bears darker and so
he's on Kodiak island.

149
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,330
Kodiak Brown bears are the biggest bears
in the world,

150
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,330
but they don't,
there's not that many attacks,

151
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:11,000
surprisingly for the size of the bear
and the many there are.

152
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,650
But there's probably also,
there's also not,

153
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,770
Kodiak island isn't like yellowstone
park.

154
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,080
I mean you don't have that many people
are really,

155
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,910
so he's getting out of deer turns around
the Baird's just on him,

156
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,170
all he has is the knife,
so he's like trying to fight it off,

157
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:32,171
stabbing the thing and the bear like
territory piece out of his arm,

158
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:33,420
out of his leg,
picks him up,

159
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,700
is shaking them around.

160
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,930
Then the bear goes off and it one point
he just like thought he was done.

161
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,950
He's like yelling at the bear,
bear comes back mauls him another time

162
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:47,951
you stab it and fighting it off and then
I guess he stabbed it enough times.

163
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,860
He kept like trying to feed his arm
whilst just like he said he was out of

164
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:54,500
strength.
I think the bear when officer like laid

165
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:58,400
down was bleeding out.
He might've crawled to his rifle at that

166
00:06:58,401 --> 00:06:59,780
point.
I think he,

167
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,060
I can't remember if the bear was dead or
not,

168
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:05,420
but he shot it after the bear was just
like laying there and then hikes,

169
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,021
you know,
three,

170
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:08,460
four miles back to the beach and he's
like,

171
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,310
ah,
I can't remember how old he was.

172
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,250
He had [inaudible] 60,
something like that.

173
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,910
I remember this story.
Yeah,

174
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,400
he was a,
and then he says,

175
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,160
so then his son,
they me to son,

176
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,030
they take them to this.

177
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,170
There's one cab in there where there's
year round residents and uh,

178
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,010
it was actually on I think raspberry
island there and they bring them into

179
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:32,500
this cabin and there was a German couple
that lives there and like he said,

180
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,340
they,
they brought him in the cabin and for

181
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,470
some reason I cannot remember exactly
why,

182
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:40,700
but the dude that owned the cabin ended
up taking a chainsaw and cutting out the

183
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:44,420
wall so the rescuers could come in and
get a stretcher in like stabilize him

184
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:48,110
cause he's just dying on the table and
they take him to Kodiak hospital,

185
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,880
do all the surgeries,
skin grafts,

186
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:52,210
everything's saved.
His life ended up getting,

187
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,150
keeping like you end up buying the
bareback at an auction and uh,

188
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,740
they may like a rug thing.

189
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,260
Oh Huh.
I mean that's why the the Romans,

190
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,250
I mean when they were feeding the lions
are Christians.

191
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,410
Right.
That's what that was all bout.

192
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:10,120
It's like to see how long that guy can
last in there just to get her Saudi or

193
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,510
release at ours.
Check this out.

194
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,090
This is like,
that's the story that I did not know

195
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:16,520
about.
So what though it up,

196
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:20,810
it was after day.
Would the have the beastie their fight

197
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:24,350
each other or they'll dive the lie on
seat Cristianos or something than a

198
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:27,590
typical thing is that after the end of
the day when a whole bunch of these

199
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,840
animals have been killed in one fight or
another,

200
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,060
the Roman emperors to kind of look cool
and popular with the crowds who then

201
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,000
distribute the meat to all the poor
people of Rome.

202
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,470
So all the animals killed India in,
I would then be eaten by all the poorest

203
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:47,180
people in Rome as a Freebie because you
are a poor person and you're more likely

204
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:47,570
than not.

205
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,240
A lot of people in a room,
we're pretty close to starving a lot of

206
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:51,740
the times.
Nothing.

207
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,870
Get them be thrown away.
You eat scene,

208
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,130
right?
You eat the whole,

209
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,150
whatever they give you,
you eat it.

210
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,750
So what does that mean?
That means that among other things,

211
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:05,751
they would end up as weird exotic dish
in on the on Arrow one table.

212
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,380
Sometime you get also the interiors of
animals that have just been eating

213
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:14,460
people.
So through via second hand,

214
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:19,340
you're also eating people cc or eating
stomach contents of a lie on that just

215
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,050
got killed.
India,

216
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,050
INA and ally on just finish feeding on a
Christie and so you're having a Lion

217
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,753
Christiane Burger for yourself.

218
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,500
[inaudible].
