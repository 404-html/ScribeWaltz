1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,640
The joe rogan experience.
We know.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:07,280
What I'm fascinated with right now is
there's so many ex CIA agents come and

3
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:09,590
clean and talking,
man.

4
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:11,660
And there's a bunch of,
yeah,

5
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,700
do you ever watch homeland?
No.

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:16,130
People are going to start dying.
A great show in car crashes

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,550
happen in nine 11 that you hear about
like loose change and all the,

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:22,820
all the other documentaries that were
talking about it.

9
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,571
Then they're like,
all of a sudden,

10
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:25,310
like this guy died in a fire at his
house.

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,720
Chronicles is hard.
Anybody that comes forward as a witness,

12
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,970
they all,
they get their heads blown off and then

13
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:34,700
the coroner puts suicide.
So for body after body,

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,900
after body,
people die.

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,510
Tila Tequila.
Who's dating the Johnson and Johnson?

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,920
What happened?
The girl,

17
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,130
the remember Tila Tequila.
Uh,

18
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,550
she was dating,
you know,

19
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:45,290
like baby Johnson,
the shampoo and stuff,

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,610
or she was like doing her like her
lesbian thing with the daughter and

21
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:52,580
we'll the daughter I'd like ended up
dying or like Tila Tequila come out in

22
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:53,800
this crazy,
uh,

23
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,540
youtube videos was talking about
Illuminati was like,

24
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,680
man,
these people are trying to get me

25
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:57,950
killed.

26
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:59,870
There's no,
I don't,

27
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm not for sure exactly,
really doubt anybody do anything but

28
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,940
laugh if they found out the Tila
Tequila,

29
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,210
if I was the Illuminati,
I would want Tila Tequila talked about

30
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,800
the Illuminati.
I'd be like,

31
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,900
yeah,
I send her a fucking dossier with

32
00:01:11,901 --> 00:01:14,750
everything in it.
Tell her everything we're doing and tell

33
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:16,940
that bitch to start our website is doing
a good job there.

34
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,010
She left,
she started doing that and then they

35
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:19,521
would go,
yeah,

36
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:20,900
yeah,
till it's Kyla told you that.

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,700
Okay,
we're done here.

38
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:26,990
We just release all the truths and just
give it to Tila Tequila.

39
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,910
That's the way when she starts her show,
you'd be like,

40
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:31,700
what the like what Tila Tequila is
Edward Snowden.

41
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,770
Tila Tequila is Julian and his size.
No,

42
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:35,800
it's fucking Tila.
Tequila stop,

43
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,050
bitch.
You think that's ridiculous.

44
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,800
That's shit's crazy though,
is using her.

45
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,190
She's,
she's upon,

46
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,010
they have the documents.
You don't think they can find a better

47
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:54,011
spokesperson for Tila fucking Tequila.
She went off to kill our lovers.

48
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,690
Tila Tequila has died seven times.
Sure.

49
00:01:59,691 --> 00:02:01,580
She has shut shut.
That off.

50
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:05,990
Stop is exactly the shit I'm talking
about.

51
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,970
If you look at Wikipedia,
he would go,

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,050
okay,
try talking to Neil Tyson or you know,

53
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,420
Sam Harris about what Tila Tequila told
you.

54
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,720
They'll fucking eyes to glaze over the
conversation to be done in 10 minutes to

55
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,720
stop.
And nothing wrong with sealed to kill.

56
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:23,840
It's a very pretty girl.
Maybe she's got some good points.

57
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,360
But I was,
I was living in Dallas and I was 42

58
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:31,570
years old when ecstasy hit the streets.
Mtma and uh,

59
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,750
I,
I'd never taken any drugs.

60
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,050
I didn't even smoke pot came out of the
navy and everything are not scoring an

61
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:37,884
attorney.
Right?

62
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,080
Yeah.
And in Houston I was an attorney then in

63
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:43,540
Dallas I started a computer company.
I had a personal computer company that

64
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,020
uh,
well in 1981 we outgrowth Microsoft,

65
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,390
you know,
I had four color picture in Forbes

66
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:50,880
magazine,
made the front page of the Wall Street

67
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,060
Journal and really then ibm came in and
crushed us like a bug.

68
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,670
Wow.
What was the name of your computer

69
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:58,590
company ready for?
This is in Dallas,

70
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,390
Texas and I named it dynasty.
Oh,

71
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,150
my dynasty computer corporation.
But it's hilarious.

72
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,520
It was a,
we were the amway of computers.

73
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,460
I had like 3000 distributors around the
country and uh,

74
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,780
it was,
it was crazy.

75
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,610
And we sold,
we sold this machine.

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,630
You want to hear this?
I don't know.

77
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,760
Or yeah,
it was an eight k machine,

78
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,810
the 16 K of Ram.
And it was a 12 inch black and white

79
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:23,890
monitor and a cassette tape deck is what
we use for input and output.

80
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,990
And you'd have to load your,
your,

81
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,870
uh,
your boot program and then you get a crc

82
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,940
error.
So you're just the tone and rewind it

83
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:35,941
and then loaded again.
And we sold hundreds of these for 3000

84
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:39,430
bucks each y and,
and parents that say,

85
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:41,230
you know,
why do I need this?

86
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,060
You know,
you've got recipe program and,

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
and Pong and a couple of games.
And I said,

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,130
I don't know why you need it,
but if your kids don't have this,

89
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,600
they're going to be left behind.
Why?

90
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,080
When they're 30 years old.
And,

91
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,110
uh,
later,

92
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,310
uh,
I was talking to one of the Java

93
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,870
conventions in San Francisco and a guy
came up to me and gave me his card and

94
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,450
he's CEO of a company and like a hundred
programmers and all,

95
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,440
and he said,
you don't remember me,

96
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:02,710
do you?

97
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,330
And I said,
no.

98
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,470
He says,
my dad bought a computer from you and

99
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,930
you told them that would help me.
Wow.

100
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,140
I don't know if anybody else got help,
but at least one customer turned out.

101
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,850
Well,
what year was this?

102
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,620
Uh,
let's see.

103
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:19,621
We went out of business,
I started in [inaudible] 79 79 and we

104
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:24,130
made it till 84 y and it was,
it was great.

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,970
It was,
you know,

106
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,380
you heard of the DOTCOM bubble?
Well,

107
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:29,680
this was the PC bubble and it was before
IBM got in and you know,

108
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:32,660
we'd run short and memory chips and I'd
call up my friend at Osborne.

109
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,110
He'd ship me some and then when I got
some back I'd ship him.

110
00:04:36,111 --> 00:04:38,890
And it was a closed network is pretty
good old boy thing,

111
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,970
you know,
fascinating.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,770
And there's a lot of fun.
It was great fun.

113
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,520
But,
uh,

114
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,750
we didn't know what we're doing,
you know,

115
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,190
we were geeks and,
and uh,

116
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,740
I didn't know anything about cashflow or
business,

117
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:49,210
you know,
I had been an electrical engineer and a

118
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,440
lawyer,
but I didn't know anything about

119
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,870
business.
And so we,

120
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,640
we just sort of sold ourselves out of
business.

121
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:58,000
And by the time we were done,
the last six or eight,

122
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:00,820
nine months,
I was financing the thing by selling

123
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:01,654
ecstasy.

124
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,040
I knew a guy,
my acting class,

125
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,800
and you know how long I was smacked in
class years.

126
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,500
I loved it by the way,
for a lot of reasons.

127
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,410
Mainly because it was just fun to be in
a just,

128
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,100
there's a lot of craziness and Joe would
always make fun of me,

129
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:16,940
but I,
there was a guy,

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,770
really good guy,
normal guy,

131
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,050
so I thought,
and he was,

132
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,060
and I hired him to shoot me to shoot
this audition.

133
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:29,810
So I go to his house and he's got this
great camera and on his wall is a dream

134
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:33,940
board and on his wall is his,
no,

135
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,501
no,
no,

136
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:34,880
no,
no.

137
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,650
He's put his face,
he's put pictures of his face on the

138
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:42,530
cover of vanity fair and those
magazines,

139
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,130
he's got slogan's saying,
you're the guy,

140
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:50,150
you're the one and it's a dream board.
And it was big.

141
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,070
It was good.
Covered his whole wall man.

142
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,930
And,
and he's a good guy and he's like,

143
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:56,660
he's a normal guy.
And a lot of ways he's just been told

144
00:05:56,661 --> 00:05:59,300
the wrong as Jay Davis.
I know it is not cheap.

145
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,850
I love that.
It's almost like,

146
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,320
you know,
go to a girl's house and she's got too

147
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:07,400
many stuffed animals on the bed.
That's like the male equivalent that he

148
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,880
thought
he would know.

149
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,160
He was trying to visualize his future
and it never,

150
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,910
I remember going to always never going
to happen no matter who I should know.

151
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,400
Jay Davis,
Jay Jay was very nice.

152
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:23,500
He's a great guy.
He's a good galaxy to the reason you did

153
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,510
is Jay so enthusiastic.
The board,

154
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,510
yeah.
Is just an enthusiastic guy who's just

155
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,310
loves everybody.
But,

156
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,920
but uh,
this guy handsome,

157
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,360
tall,
you know,

158
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,050
suave and just the whole,
it's like you're a Dork,

159
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:39,350
bro.

160
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,830
I got to help you take that down right
now you get his picture,

161
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,930
his face over celebrities faces on
Vanity Fair and people magazine.

162
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm not kidding.
He can visualize himself doing that.

163
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,230
It's all Dane Cook a big,
well,

164
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,670
I don't know
Joe,

165
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:59,840
stop bringing maisie.
You're going to run into that guy and

166
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:01,910
he's not going to have made it and he's
going to go,

167
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:07,090
you're the reason
he's a good guy.

168
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,830
I want the best for,
I love the guy actually.

169
00:07:09,831 --> 00:07:11,160
He's a great guy.
It's just nuts.

170
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,040
He was told what happens sometimes is
people are told something enough times

171
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,990
and they forget to stop and think.
It's exactly what you're talking about.

172
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,420
What the Fox thing is like,
who says you can't swear and why are you

173
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,460
doing with somebody?
Why is it,

174
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:27,170
why are you doing with a court?
You forgot the idea of a podcast.

175
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,460
You have to keep thinking because you'll
make choices sometimes because you're

176
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:33,180
told that this works.
Yeah.

177
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,530
Who Shed it works.
I can't visualize running pumps back in

178
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:39,530
the NFL or fighting in the octagon.
Don't have it.

179
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,850
No matter what I do and can happen,
I'm getting fucking knocked out because

180
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:46,010
my bone structure for a thousand
reasons,

181
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,540
I don't have it.
Okay.

182
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,130
Tried,
didn't work.

183
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,350
So you know,
you've got to,

184
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,300
yes,
you should dream big,

185
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,600
but you should also be realistic with
who you are.

186
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,110
Okay.
Yeah.
