1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,540
The Joe Rogan experience
I said on on on camera,

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:08,541
we had an email from somebody who said
that his master could point pressure so

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,590
they could knock you out.

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,660
I got a great story about Tulsa with Amir.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,441
Anyway,

6
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,400
I looked into the camera.

7
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:14,791
I said,

8
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:15,210
okay,

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,150
anybody in America you're
watching right now,

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,220
if you have a person who gets,

11
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,870
who says that he can knock me out with
a punch like it just pressing somewhere.

12
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,220
We invite them,

13
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,150
we pay him,

14
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,080
we pay his trip.

15
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,230
He can come on to show he
can do it on camera on me.

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,430
He can knock me out.

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:32,851
I said,

18
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,190
it's a no lose situation
for me because if it works,

19
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,640
I'm signing up to do that stuff.

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,361
But I tell you,

21
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,230
it's not gonna work.

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,251
We had this guy,

23
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:41,760
but uh,

24
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,090
you know,

25
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,970
a mirror progressive,

26
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,430
you know,

27
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,270
mostly where my buddy,

28
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,350
we,

29
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,410
we see these guys on
stage and the touch guys,

30
00:00:49,411 --> 00:00:50,070
right?

31
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,540
So one guy goes this thick,

32
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,903
this one,

33
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,590
they just fall back.

34
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,880
And then the guy said,

35
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:58,770
did you see his eyes
roll back in his skill?

36
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,930
That means you was for real.

37
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,610
So I go to America,

38
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,410
this is going to be fun much this.

39
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,580
So these guys,

40
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,110
they come walking down after the.

41
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:07,561
I said,

42
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:07,801
okay,

43
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,300
dude did to me.

44
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,860
I want you to do it to me.

45
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:11,380
Wait a minute.

46
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,213
God said,

47
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,200
are you sure about that?

48
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,760
I show it to me.

49
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,001
I,

50
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,151
I,

51
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:15,470
you know,

52
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,500
I want to know how to feel it.

53
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,161
And he goes,

54
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:17,581
you know what?

55
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:18,414
I could actually,

56
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,530
I got something better.

57
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:20,880
So we already steered away from it,

58
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,600
right?

59
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,433
So he says,

60
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,760
let me show you this.

61
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,200
And he walks over to his body,

62
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,590
they start talking to each other and
then he walks away and in the corner he

63
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:31,434
stands like this,

64
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,360
like I mean crazy hiney run to his
friend and he goes like this in emit air.

65
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,510
He stops and he flies on the ground.

66
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,640
So he threw like Kung Fu
forehands I didn't touch him.

67
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,543
Does it touch him?

68
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,131
I go,

69
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:51,964
do it.

70
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,020
I'm sold.

71
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,580
Do that to me,

72
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,030
right?

73
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,470
I'm going to take you right now.

74
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,910
So I'm going to the corner.

75
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:58,690
And he goes,

76
00:01:58,690 --> 00:01:58,901
yeah,

77
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,640
but you have to be a really angry.

78
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,870
I said,

79
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,321
excuse me?

80
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:02,510
Yeah,

81
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,011
really angry.

82
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:03,910
Otherwise it won't work.

83
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,740
I say your friend just did it right?

84
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,371
I say,

85
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:06,580
um,

86
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,110
I think I can better egg then your friend.

87
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:08,561
Don't worry.

88
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,460
I'll be in the zone.

89
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,390
Nobody will.

90
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:10,661
He says,

91
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:10,791
no,

92
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:10,960
no,

93
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,490
because if it,

94
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,510
if you're not real angry,

95
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,501
it doesn't work.

96
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,730
It needs to be that balance.

97
00:02:15,731 --> 00:02:16,990
So I knew it was his way out.

98
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,210
So I walked over to him
and I'm standing like this.

99
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:21,100
I say kick me into pills.

100
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:21,770
And he says,

101
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,200
well,

102
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,670
give me the.

103
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,310
I say I'm really fucking pissed.

104
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,880
He didn't want to do it.

105
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,714
Needless to say,

106
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,261
I mean,

107
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:32,290
but they're idiots that
truly believe that is true.

108
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:32,460
When

109
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,870
you stop and think about what
an actual football player today,

110
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,130
310 pound man who can run like,

111
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,690
like literally like a track
star of the 19 thirties,

112
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,540
you know,

113
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,560
when you stop and think about the kind
of damage they can do and you sort of

114
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:52,460
look towards the future and
extrapolate a thousand years from now,

115
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,000
2000 years now actually when this drastic
changes happening just the last 50,

116
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:56,781
60 years,

117
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:57,640
it's unbelief.

118
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,130
When you look at the
guys were a third larger

119
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,290
than they used to be ingested 50 years,

120
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,270
so you extrapolate that out.

121
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:04,511
Uh,

122
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:07,060
and of course there's genetic
and physical limitations,

123
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,720
but as Jeanette,

124
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,071
as,

125
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,340
as nutrition improves and science improves
and genetic engineering proves you're

126
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:15,640
gonna wind up in the future pro
sports a couple of centuries now.

127
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,480
Pro Sport you're not.

128
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:17,560
I mean they're not even
going to look human.

129
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,580
They're gonna look like
a different species.

130
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,630
That's how I came up with the
idea for the book is I used to be.

131
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,520
I used to do little stuff where
espn when I was in college,

132
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,080
like manage the teams coming off the
field or hold the dish and that kind of a

133
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:28,720
thing.

134
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,900
And I had was 126 pounds and Michigan,

135
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,790
Michigan State's at giant
football game every year.

136
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,653
It's huge.

137
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,400
ESPN is there and my producer,

138
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,030
Al Kilian,

139
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,030
I'm on the headset with him and he's
gotten me bringing the teams out of the,

140
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,390
out of their dressing room and then he
starts screwing with me because I'm 19.

141
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,830
I don't know any better
and he's in my ears.

142
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,580
And listen,

143
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,900
if they don't come out at the right time,

144
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,380
espn is going to lose $5,000,000 of
advertising and that's gonna be on you.

145
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,513
And I'm like,

146
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,310
he was fucking with me because he could
because I didn't know any better and I'm

147
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:58,920
like so stressed out and then let Michigan
state out of the locker room at the

148
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,630
point in time and all these giant
human beings are coming out.

149
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,220
And then as they're coming out,

150
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,211
they're running,

151
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,070
walking by the door to
the Michigan locker room,

152
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,801
Michigan.

153
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:09,720
The door lock room door opens
up and standing in the door.

154
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:10,570
Is Greg Scrap Knack?

155
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:11,260
You ever heard of him?

156
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,560
No.

157
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,131
He was six,

158
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:12,400
eight,

159
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,233
three,

160
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,060
three 60.

161
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,370
It was.

162
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,203
He was an,

163
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,150
it was a giant,

164
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:16,984
giant man.

165
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,930
Plus he's got all the gear
on and I'm on and I'm like.

166
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,450
And I'm,

167
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,460
I'm a little tiny thing.

168
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:21,971
I'm freaking out.

169
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:22,180
I'm like,

170
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:22,591
Oh hell,

171
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:23,470
Michigan is going to come out.

172
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,220
He's like,

173
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,990
you don't let them come
out of that locker room.

174
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,430
I don't care what you have to do.

175
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:28,780
And so I.

176
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,360
he's a giant.

177
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,260
He's six foot eight.

178
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm five eight.

179
00:04:33,221 --> 00:04:37,510
I'm 125 pounds and I and he goes to step
out and I just put my hand right right

180
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,050
on the sternum.

181
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,870
I just stiff arm and
what stopped right there.

182
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,510
You guys can't come out of
that locker room yet and just

183
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,410
he looked confused was like,

184
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,480
who is this little person?

185
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,960
And he managed to wait and all the guys
were behind him and he mans wait just

186
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,180
long enough for Michigan state to come
out and then I got out of the way and

187
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,014
they came out,

188
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,620
but I had.

189
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,260
I wrote the whole concept of
the book and that one moment,

190
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,940
the whole gfl series I had
my hand on this guy's here.

191
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,050
My nose came up to his sternum and
I remember thinking it's like he's a

192
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,910
completely different species than me and
that was an after that I went home and

193
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:09,790
started writing that book.

194
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,980
Like what if we have different
species playing football?

195
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:12,701
And the whole thing blew up.

196
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:13,534
From there.

197
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,490
People

198
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,260
feel about you taking off,

199
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:20,650
going to America to let everybody know
about them and then flying back again.

200
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:21,420
It means this.

201
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,250
This must be so bizarre for them.

202
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,001
Yeah.

203
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:27,060
Well that's what's crazy at first.

204
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,230
Every other night,

205
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:28,590
well,

206
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,580
I've been to more than nine,

207
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:33,210
but the last time I went I went to
nine different tribes and of pygmies,

208
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,650
a little nine villages.

209
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,710
Each one of them never
seen a white dude before.

210
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,280
Uh,

211
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,140
so that scares them.

212
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,441
I mean,

213
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:42,450
there'd be times that
it would take an hour,

214
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,430
maybe even sometimes a little over
an hour before someone in that tribe.

215
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,360
Most of the time it was always women or
children that would finally come up to

216
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:54,770
me and touch me to make sure they don't
go through me like I was a spirit or a

217
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,770
ghost of some sort.

218
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,730
Um,

219
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:00,500
and then one person felt me and I'd
play a game with them or something like

220
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:00,740
that.

221
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,540
Then more would,

222
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,550
I mean literally come out
from hiding behind trees,

223
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,713
come out from,

224
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,831
from the forest.

225
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,431
Whenever I come in,

226
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,390
sometimes they would flee,

227
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:08,811
run,

228
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,240
cry kids like flailing on the ground,

229
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,510
like,

230
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,680
just freaked out by me.

231
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,640
Um,

232
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,960
but whenever I'd make friends with them,

233
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,650
uh,

234
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,540
then they would ask me one
thing every place that I want.

235
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:19,490
No nine tribes.

236
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,091
Uh,

237
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:23,090
they asked me will I
help them have a voice?

238
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,351
That was the thing.

239
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:24,621
They were like,

240
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:25,850
we have no voice here.

241
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,430
They're the only tribe not
allowed to have their citizenship.

242
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,210
Um,

243
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,090
in Congo and like,

244
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,420
so they have zero voice.

245
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,613
Wow.

246
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,620
What a strange turn your life
has taken that this is a,

247
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:41,990
you've gone from being on the
house and the ultimate fighter,

248
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:42,660
you know,

249
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,660
competing in the heavyweight version of
the show to now live in a grass hut in

250
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:48,650
the Congo.

251
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,951
What a,

252
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,680
that's a stranger alif hot
rather strange journey.

253
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:53,031
You're on,

254
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:53,864
man.

255
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,943
Yeah.

256
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,783
To be honest,

257
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,590
I wouldn't change it.

258
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:58,041
For me,

259
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:58,640
actually,

260
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,540
booze was my savior because I was hanging
out with a lot of dudes were doing

261
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,374
some serious,

262
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,790
serious drugs,

263
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,683
bad drugs,

264
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,300
and my whole thing was I don't
want to be 60 years old and not.

265
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,190
So I always have this
idyllic sort of retirement,

266
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,170
which I'm trying to get to
sooner rather than later.

267
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,400
Now it's just like,

268
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,410
just sort of forgotten like little cove,

269
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,760
you know,

270
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,340
little code.

271
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,330
That'd be a neighbor and I'm
sitting there at this school.

272
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,400
I'm going to send you this,

273
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,390
I'm going to send you this,

274
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:26,900
uh,

275
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,830
this article of this.

276
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,760
How old are your kids?

277
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,330
At?

278
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,770
Three and a one and a half.

279
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,580
Dude,

280
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,100
I got a foreign,

281
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,530
a party.

282
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,420
I'm going to tell you.

283
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,790
I'm going to send you the boys or girls.

284
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,270
Girls.

285
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:38,510
Okay.

286
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,940
We got a big lesbian super party.

287
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,490
I'm going to send you this article.

288
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,490
It's a fantastic article about a
dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma,

289
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,031
lymphoma,

290
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:50,631
cancer,

291
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:51,920
like the worst cancer you can ever.

292
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,720
And and he was a Greek dude.

293
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,010
He grew up in America,

294
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:55,370
but like,

295
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,670
you know,

296
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,870
came here when he was three assumption.

297
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,520
So he goes back to Greece to this little
island in the middle of nowhere and he

298
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,990
has to walk up this hill every day.

299
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:04,040
He goes to talk to his buddies,

300
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:04,791
drinking the wine,

301
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:08,120
he's eating the food from the farm
or wherever and all of a sudden,

302
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,290
like five years.

303
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,170
But he was given like,

304
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,371
you know,

305
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:11,600
six months to live or whatever,

306
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,860
not even six weeks to live.

307
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,120
And,

308
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,960
and they said,

309
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:15,051
well,

310
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:15,321
you know,

311
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,220
what the fuck happened.

312
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:16,671
You didn't die.

313
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,001
And he goes,

314
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:17,360
you know,

315
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,850
I came here and I forgot
to die because you know,

316
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,360
he's sitting there and,

317
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,930
and there's no stress.

318
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,770
And he's walking up the
hill every day and he's,

319
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,640
he's drinking wine with his buddies
and he's eating the food from the,

320
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:28,870
you know,

321
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,040
the fish from the bay
and the fucking whenever.

322
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,750
And I sit there and I say,

323
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:32,990
you know,

324
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,880
now I'm looking at this shit.

325
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,230
So my idyllic retirements,

326
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:40,130
basically I'm stealing this guy who
killed cancer by living this euphoric life

327
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,790
of I live on this little cove
and I'm drinking my wine.

328
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,000
And I'm sitting out there and I'm
just blissing out unreality now.

329
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,800
That's why I didn't get hooked to heroin.

330
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,870
That's why I didn't get
hooked to fucking crack.

331
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:53,030
That's why I didn't get hooked all
the shit to my boys got hooked too.

332
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,680
Because I always thought to myself,

333
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,550
if I fucking get hooked to this shit,

334
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,220
I'm going to have to a
die or be fucking quit it,

335
00:08:59,221 --> 00:08:59,881
and if I quit it,

336
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:00,271
guess what?

337
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,660
I'm never going to be able to sit on that
fucking cove with my glass of fucking

338
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:04,560
wine sitting up there.

339
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,940
I'm being this blissful old Buddha,

340
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,590
right sophia?

341
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,530
And that's why I don't.

342
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,990
That's why I don't judge anybody,

343
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:12,780
because I'll tell you what everyone's
trying to get through the day to get to

344
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,040
their God damn cove.

345
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,710
The.
