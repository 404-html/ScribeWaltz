1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,910
Her low freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,310
It was the most brutal injury I've ever,

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,420
have you ever seen one of those before?

4
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:07,650
Have you ever seen a schoolgirl crushed?

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,251
No.

6
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:09,710
I actually had my skull fractured,

7
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,544
but not like that.

8
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,410
That was the one of the
worst things I've ever seen.

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,273
How did your sculpture,

10
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,540
I got kicked in the back of the head and
the guy had a steel plate and is a Shin

11
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,373
Guard in China.

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,333
What?

13
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:21,840
Any Shin Guard.

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,720
So we had a shin guard on
with a steel plate in it.

15
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,231
Yeah.

16
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:25,471
I mean,

17
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:28,110
I didn't really think
anything of it at the time,

18
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,410
you know,

19
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,330
this was what,

20
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:30,360
like 10 years ago,

21
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:30,660
you know,

22
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,550
we would just fight all everywhere,

23
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:33,570
anywhere or whatever,

24
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:33,901
you know,

25
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:34,320
and,

26
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,760
and not really think twice about it.

27
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:37,190
And I,

28
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:37,860
uh,

29
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,693
so I fought,

30
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,020
he kicked me in the back of the head.

31
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:40,531
I got dropped,

32
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,060
got up,

33
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,210
I ended up knocking him out,

34
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,520
fought again the very next day.

35
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,360
Um,

36
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,990
Wyatt,

37
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,291
yeah.

38
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,760
Not Knock this guy out to,

39
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:48,781
and then,

40
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:49,560
uh,

41
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,760
when we got back to the states,

42
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,880
like I was having headaches all the
time and I just thought I had a bad

43
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:54,451
concussion,

44
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:54,870
you know,

45
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,370
but like to like,

46
00:00:56,371 --> 00:00:59,570
almost like a month later I kept seeing
these like flashes of light every,

47
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,110
anytime someone would ever touch me,

48
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,561
you know,

49
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:05,370
I'd be working with like little kids or
girls and smaller people in just them

50
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:05,910
touching me.

51
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,600
I'd get this like jolt and it,

52
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,011
you know,

53
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:09,620
it was kind of freaking me out and I,

54
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:09,890
uh,

55
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,150
I was getting ready for another fight and,

56
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:12,360
uh,

57
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,800
I had to get my Mri or a cat scan.

58
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:16,680
I remember what it was.

59
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:17,371
And they're like,

60
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:17,521
yeah,

61
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:21,030
you got an inch and a half
crack in the back of your skull.

62
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,021
And they're like,

63
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know why you're
not a vegetable right now.

64
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,170
You should be there.

65
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,321
Like,

66
00:01:25,321 --> 00:01:27,020
if you even hit that again,

67
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,440
it would probably kill you.

68
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,910
Doctors always say that though.

69
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,151
Yeah,

70
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:30,670
of course.

71
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,940
What was the last time you
were fucking knocked out?

72
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:33,511
One more time.

73
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:34,344
I'm dead,

74
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,030
you know,

75
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,920
it was one inch closer to my spine.

76
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,740
I'd be dead.

77
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,311
It was,

78
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:38,641
it was,

79
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,120
it was,

80
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,980
it was pretty a rough thing to happen.

81
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,850
And I couldn't do anything other
than hit the bag by myself for,

82
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,490
I don't remember how long it
was still like it let it heal,

83
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,150
but,

84
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,520
but it,

85
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,360
it was a total,

86
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,790
just essentially at a close its own,

87
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,201
you know,

88
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:52,591
there's just like,

89
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:53,270
don't get hit,

90
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,330
you don't get hit.

91
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:58,860
And I was getting ready for a fight and
I actually still tried to fight anyway.

92
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,971
But,

93
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,190
uh,

94
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,440
the doctor who,

95
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,650
the doctor who diagnosed it
was the doctor for the fights.

96
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,161
Oh,

97
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:05,941
that's hilarious.

98
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:06,121
Like,

99
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,901
do he can't fight,

100
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,734
get out of here.

101
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,930
How long after that was the fight?

102
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,490
After the diagnosis?

103
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:11,870
Uh,

104
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,703
like a week.

105
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,740
That's a cat fight with fucking edge.

106
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,690
That's just kind of the
mentality I had coming up,

107
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,081
you know.

108
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,310
And how old were you at the time?

109
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,680
25.

110
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,180
So he just felt invulnerable?

111
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,841
No,

112
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:28,471
not really.

113
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:28,771
I mean,

114
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:29,100
my,

115
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,290
my mentality from the
beginning has always been,

116
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm going to fight as
long as I'm breathing.

117
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:33,960
And you know,

118
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,480
I've gotten into fights with
some of the worst injuries ever.

119
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:37,201
Broken hands,

120
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:37,830
broken,

121
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,730
broken skulls,

122
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,541
broken faces.

123
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,550
And that's just the way I came up.

124
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:41,851
You know,

125
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,140
like you're going to fight no matter what,

126
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,460
you're going to fight anyone,

127
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:44,971
anywhere,

128
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,511
anytime,

129
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:46,530
any weight class.

130
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,950
And that's how I was able to
get as much experience as I did.

131
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,291
Yeah.

132
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:50,471
Yeah.

133
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:55,471
The scientific research and showed at the
red cell generation can be accelerated

134
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
if it is.

135
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,270
So in those circumstances
then science has to uh,

136
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,880
update the circumstances where their
sales can be regenerated is like a,

137
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,110
in 24 hours,

138
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:12,190
the body is not able to adapt to the
circumstances where there is a lack of

139
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:12,641
oxygen.

140
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,680
It is half the oxygen and last,

141
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,110
and we go and see altitude on Kilimanjaro,

142
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,190
like 20,000 feet at the top.

143
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,980
So had to save 15,000 feet.

144
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,170
The acclimatization,

145
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:31,230
the adaptation is not as fast in human
bodies that we found his breathing

146
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:37,171
techniques and using the mind and
that enabled us to accelerate that,

147
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,390
what they thought,

148
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,440
what signs is thinking that uh,

149
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,700
that it is arranged.

150
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Autonomically so outside of our
will and we cannot interfere,

151
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:50,560
we cannot intervene now.

152
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,160
Uh,

153
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,150
so we,

154
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,370
uh,

155
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,660
we'll showed it with uh,

156
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,880
like 30 people by the
way past the January.

157
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:02,881
I did it with a person 76 years old
without a prior mountaineering experience.

158
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,030
And he did it in 44 hours,

159
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,780
dude,

160
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,561
76.

161
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:09,130
Uh,

162
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,060
I mean it's a robust 76 year old,

163
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,203
but he was a good guy.

164
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:13,920
Yes.

165
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,220
That,

166
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,940
so over a couple of days
his old life is dead,

167
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,680
really transferred.

168
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,620
So,

169
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,060
um,

170
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,900
let me ask you this.

171
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,990
So the standard model of what someone
can do as far as how much red,

172
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:32,980
so red blood cells they can generate is
observed and they thought that it was at

173
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,030
15,000 feet,

174
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,440
it became too difficult.

175
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,670
But you've shown that with your
exercises and when your deep breathing

176
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:44,671
techniques that you can
actually accelerate red blood
cell count consciously or

177
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,360
at least not consciously
through conscious action,

178
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,480
conscious action using the breath.

179
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,680
And what techniques are you using?

180
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,990
The same what we did last time,

181
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,100
but then adapted to while
you are walking and when,

182
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:00,251
uh,

183
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:00,611
you know,

184
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,080
first sign of ams,

185
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:04,600
lack of oxygen in the hat means headache.

186
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,200
A EMS is acute mountain sickness and the
first sinus headache and that means a

187
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,120
lack of oxygen inside the brain.

188
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:18,121
Normally we are not able to get the oxygen
then at that moment inside the brain

189
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,950
to equal the balance that this balance,

190
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,090
the lack of oxygen.

191
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,820
And I've learned to just to do that.

192
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,790
So we tackled the problem and keep on,

193
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,181
uh,

194
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:33,181
able to perform in the extreme conditions
even so through this technique of

195
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,770
taking these enormous deep breaths,

196
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,550
letting some of it out and then trying
to refill and then letting some of it

197
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:39,910
out,

198
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,900
trying to refill,

199
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:41,890
letting some of it out.

200
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,410
And then you're,

201
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,450
you're forcing your body to forcing
your lungs to constantly carry air.

202
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,483
Yes.

203
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,880
Uh,

204
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,620
that it is,

205
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,840
we use the lungs is the passage way,

206
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,220
but it gets into the lymphatic system.

207
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,140
It gets into the tissue.

208
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,740
You know what we just found
with the university in a,

209
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,590
in Germany,

210
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:09,040
they found out that the devices that
show that we have hundred percent,

211
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,210
uh,

212
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,260
blood saturation,

213
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,740
oxygen and the blood
is not hundred percent.

214
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,663
We go more.

215
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,560
Yeah.

216
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,790
They found it out for the first
thought was 100% blood saturation.

217
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,500
There's actually a
higher level above that.

218
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,453
Yes.

219
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,260
And that's what I always sad,

220
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,800
but now it's uh,

221
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,810
it's like proofing

222
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,283
and that I,

223
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,621
you know,

224
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:32,840
for people listening that might
be in one of those valleys,

225
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,674
it's like,

226
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,050
don't try to just get through it,

227
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,420
really ask,

228
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,531
you know,

229
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:39,800
why,

230
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,880
what can I learn from this?

231
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,090
That was my biggest thing is I stopped
asking why is this happening to me?

232
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,240
And started asking,

233
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,403
what can I learn?

234
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,420
Yeah.

235
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,460
So instead of painting
yourself as a victim,

236
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,280
you paint yourself with someone who
is present in the moment and just,

237
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:54,521
okay,

238
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:55,540
I don't want to do this anymore.

239
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:55,960
Right?

240
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,990
Let's figure out what's going on.

241
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,551
Exactly.

242
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,060
And we don't,

243
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,670
a lot of times we don't have the tools
and that's where things like life

244
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:03,210
coaching and personal development
come in handy is quits.

245
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,270
We can go and get those tools instead of
using our old coping mechanisms by like

246
00:07:07,271 --> 00:07:08,950
being strong or overing,

247
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:09,581
overworking,

248
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:10,900
overdrinking over do you know,

249
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,390
jumping into a relationship
like whatever it may be.

250
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,140
We,

251
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,920
we don't really learn how
to deal with disappointment,

252
00:07:17,921 --> 00:07:18,581
failure,

253
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:19,540
anger or shame,

254
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,380
any of those things.

255
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:25,381
And so we're kind of left to these quick
fix devices that I think that's a big

256
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:29,530
reason addiction is such a problem is
because we don't really learn how to

257
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,320
manage emotion and how to
manage just appointment.

258
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:35,860
And so we go for that thing that
makes us feel better in the moment.

259
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,380
But the problem is we have
to keep upping the ante.

260
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,603
You know,

261
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,760
at first that one glass
of wine does the trick,

262
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,811
but then you need to,

263
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:44,441
then you need three,

264
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,250
then need vodka,

265
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,360
whatever it may be.

266
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,291
And so,

267
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,124
I mean,

268
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,960
why I'm so passionate about what I do is,

269
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:50,794
first of all,

270
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,030
I never,

271
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,250
I never thought I could be happy.

272
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,473
Like I really didn't.

273
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,850
I thought that this,

274
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,211
you know,

275
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:58,810
I,

276
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,100
I was going to be depressed and I just
was gonna constantly be looking for

277
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:04,660
something to fix me.

278
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,400
I never really,

279
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,540
truly thought this life that
I'm living now what as possible.

280
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,170
Again,

281
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:11,681
externally,

282
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:12,311
things look fine,

283
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:16,480
but internally I'm talking about a totally
different kind of experience and it's

284
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:19,990
only because of those
like really awful moments.

285
00:08:19,991 --> 00:08:24,991
I call them expectation hangovers that
I was kind of desperate enough to let go

286
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:30,310
of my normal coping mechanisms and
my trying to control everything.

287
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:33,790
It was like the ultimate and
surrender truly of going okay.

288
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,540
Like I don't,

289
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,373
I don't know.

290
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,690
I need to find a different
way to deal with this.

291
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,590
And that's really what has
led me down the path that,

292
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,740
that I am today.

293
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,040
[inaudible].
