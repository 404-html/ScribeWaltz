00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,460
this episode of the podcast.

9
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:11,670
Oh,

12
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,980
Steps of the podcast brought to you by

14
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:21,180
you will save yourself 10%
off any of the supplements.

15
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,880
We've got a lot of new stuff
there if you haven't been there,

16
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:25,770
especially in the fitness department.

17
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,300
We have of course the new primal kettle
bells that are kettle bells that with a

18
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,180
chimpanzee's face that looks
like he's biting your Dick off.

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,193
That's what it looks like.

20
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,870
That's the look that a chimp makes right
when he clamps down on your nutsack

21
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,730
crazy little evil animals.

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,331
Uh,

23
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:44,460
we also have weight vests and uh,

24
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,390
if you look at all this stuff,

25
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,200
it looks like armor.

26
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,711
It's not,

27
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:47,461
it looks like steel.

28
00:00:47,461 --> 00:00:48,271
Macy's a weapon.

29
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:48,871
It's not okay.

30
00:00:48,871 --> 00:00:50,850
Folks is just shit to work out with.

31
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:51,870
Uh,

32
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,160
and George St Pierre will tell you,

33
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,140
functional strength is where it's at,

34
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:55,411
right?

35
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:57,060
George Chin ups and Shit.

36
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,390
George's all into gymnastics
and body weight exercises.

37
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,690
Every time I see this pull up bar it looks
like a hacksaw like this is to use to

38
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,370
cut off your head of your enemy.

39
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:05,781
Yeah.

40
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:06,720
Underneath that too.

41
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:09,130
Boy You do the Chin ups for a Polo,

42
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,030

43
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:10,910
Zombie heads off.

44
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:12,590
We've got awesome all kinds of shit.

45
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:13,010
They're like,

46
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,780
oh Madison bells and um,

47
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,261
and uh,

48
00:01:15,261 --> 00:01:17,700
lots of supplements to make
your body and mind strong.

49
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,231
Matter of fact,

50
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:22,400
I just took four Alpha brains right
before the show and I got a solid eight

51
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,234
hours sleep.

52
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,141
That shit's important,

53
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:24,970
right George?

54
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,700
Yeah.

55
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,451
Fuck yeah.

56
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:30,680
That's George Saint Pierre pitching
respect when he says it's important,

57
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:31,514
it's important.

58
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,810
I did not get eight hours sleep.

59
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,430
I don't believe you.

60
00:01:34,431 --> 00:01:35,510
I think I went to bed at seven.

61
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:36,291
Uh,

62
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:41,120
this episode is also brought to you by
stamps.com stamps.com is a one of the

63
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:43,400
newer sponsors of our podcast,

64
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,600
our podcast.

65
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,950
Is that what it is now?

66
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:47,060
It is when you're selling products,

67
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:47,270
right?

68
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,103
It's like a broadcast.

69
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:48,860
Um,

70
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,860
stamps.com is the way it's set up is a
lot of times if you have a small business

71
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:57,080
and people sell out packages and shit,

72
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,630
you have to go to the post office
and they have to wait all that stuff.

73
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,920
You have to wait in line.

74
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,030
It's a pain that Dick,

75
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,380
nobody enjoys it.

76
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,041
And The lady,

77
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,920
she doesn't want to see you walking
up with your big stupid fucking bundle

78
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,260
packages that she has to weigh.

79
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:12,410
The whole thing takes a long ass time and
there could be three or four people in

80
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:14,390
front of you and they're
all doing the same thing.

81
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,340
You're there forever instead of that,

82
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:20,150
you can do it all from your computer
if you buy any of those desk squad tee

83
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:22,760
shirts from desk squad.tv
that Brian's cells,

84
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,200
that's exactly where they come from.

85
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,470
They're all this a stamps.com so you set
it up so you weigh your stuff at your

86
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:31,460
place,

87
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,300
you print up your own
little postal thing on it.

88
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,270
Yeah.

89
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,290
And there's paper or he gets
printed right on the envelope.

90
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,370
It's a really fucking easy,

91
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,670
even Tom Segura does it
also that we all do it.

92
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,410
Like if you listen to any podcasts
and they have merchandise,

93
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,030
it's probably going through stamps.com,

94
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,780
because there's no,

95
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,540
there's no way in the road you'd
want to do the post office.

96
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,440
Yeah,

97
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,230
that much.

98
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,520
And if you go to,

99
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:53,354
um,

100
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,040
there's a a little,

101
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:55,170
uh,

102
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,350
up in the upper right hand corner,

103
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,021
stamps.com.

104
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:57,510
You can see the,

105
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,520
there's a little microphone icon.

106
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,340
If you click on that and enter
in the code named Jay are,

107

you will get the,

108
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:04,391
uh,

109
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,610
the offer that they're showing
up there on the screen.

110
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,500

111
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,393

114

You're not allowed to
use to measure your weed.

115
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,750
Okay?

116
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,670
This is only for the post man.

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,953

about Tang on this show,

126
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,960

that own Tang and it's a domain name

127
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,060
company and they have the
same approach at Tongass,

128
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,361

129
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,194

try to give people a good product at a
good price and keep everybody happy and

132
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,570
make it easy and they,

133
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,140

134
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:50,620

135
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,453

157
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,590
You fucking made that up.

158
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,223
Um,

159
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,080
that's it.

160
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,040
A Wednesday night,

168
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,190

La stopped by a lot of times.

169
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,480
It's like we've done them with like eight,

170
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,314
10 people there.

171
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
Now the ice house is awesome to them.

172
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:56,590
We're probably going to
do a podcast with Burt,

173
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,310

174
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,690

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:19,671
All right.

187
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:20,170
Your Fox.

00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,170
the contam welterweight
champion in the world.

190
00:05:23,171 --> 00:05:23,830
Bitches.

191
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,820
We're going to get down to it.

192
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,841
Play the music,

193
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:26,674
Brian.

194
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,003
Yeah,

195
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,150
the Joe Rogan experience.

196
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,211
Oh,

197
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,670
you cut out the Nick Dia as part.

198
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:36,504
Let's see what he did.

199
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:37,870
Very,

200
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,703
very smart.

201
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,440
There was a thing that
Nick Diaz had a quote.

202
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:41,800
It's like,

203
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,070
you know,

204
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:44,740
train by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

205
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,180
And I do not hate him.

206
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,220
Now if you folks it up
just listening to this,

207
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,490
George Saint Pierre is our guests and
he's a UFC welterweight champion of the

208
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,030
world.

209
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,450
Just recently defended his
title against Nick Diaz.

210
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,770
Um,

211
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,310
does,

212
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,220
does you call it nick now it seems like
you guys were complimentary after the

213
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:03,054
fight.

214
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,630
What am,

215
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,890
I don't know if he's cool with me.

216
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:05,651
I'm an got I.

217
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:06,451
I'm all right.

218
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:07,290
I'm cool with everybody.

219
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,070
That dude turns everything
into a personal affair,

220
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,360
right?

221
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,193
Yes he does.

222
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,340
Does that ever get to you
when guys should talk to you?

223
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:15,030
Cause you're like,

224
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,650
if people didn't know you all right,

225
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,870
if for the average person did not
know what you do besides the look,

226
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,350
you know that you're physically strong,

227
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,910
they would never think
that you're a fighter.

228
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,080
You're a very friendly guy.

229
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:26,280
You're very like easy to,

230
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,580
I've seen you interact with a lot
of different people over many years.

231
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,820
You're very easygoing,

232
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:31,470
very,

233
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:32,450
very nice to get along with.

234
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,870
Yeah.

235
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,820
I don't want to be,

236
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,200
I don't want it to look like a fighter.

237
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:36,700
When he talked to me and
let's say on the phone,

238
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:39,100
I want it to look like
a normal human being.

239
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,460
Right?

240
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:39,881
Of course.

241
00:06:39,881 --> 00:06:40,480
Yeah.

242
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:40,901
That's,

243
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,520
it may a little bit the impression
that people would have some time.

244
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:43,931
Well,

245
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:44,230
you're,

246
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,460
you're not just a nice guy.

247
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:45,941
You'll like,

248
00:06:45,941 --> 00:06:48,460
you're honest about your
own vulnerabilities,

249
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,990
which I've always found fascinating.

250
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,350
Like you talk about what,

251
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,390
what makes you scared.

252
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,890
You talk about what you're worried about.

253
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:54,240
Like,

254
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,950
you know,

255
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,250
like even this nick dance,

256
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,591
what you like,

257
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:59,290
I am scared because I don't
want to lose to this guy.

258
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,540
Like this is a lot of
people who never admit that

259
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,570
and yeah.

260
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,410
But it may make you think and make you
stronger to admit that you're scared

261
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,630
because you're not scared
to say that you are scared.

262
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Right.

263
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,070
Someone who doesn't admit it because
he's scared to admit that he's scared,

264
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,380
scared of himself,

265
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,730
scare care of what people
are gonna think about him.

266
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:18,590
I'm not scared what people going to think.

267
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,110
They have to see me as I as I am.

268
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:22,790
So I'm not scared to
admit that I'm scared.

269
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,640
And it's almost like when you
don't admit you're scared,

270
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:26,474
it's like you're praying,

271
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,130
you're protecting yourself from evolving
because the only way you can ever be

272
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:34,700
realistic about a situation and get better
at anything in life is you've got to

273
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,470
accurately address what's happening.

274
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,110
Sure.

275
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,860
100% with,

276
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,170
you know,

277
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,530
and there's some people
that don't do that,

278
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:43,910
and I think that cuts them off from
a certain amount of progress in life.

279
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,900
I think there's a certain,

280
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:45,410
there's,

281
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,340
there's like walls that
you put up yourself because
you're not willing to look

282
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:50,420
at your own failures

283
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,600
but sent,

284
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,361
you're not the,

285
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:54,550
you're not the honest with yourself.

286
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,440
So that's what it is.

287
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,274
I did a bit.

288
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:57,761
Yeah,

289
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:01,390
so admitting you're you're
afraid is like so what?

290
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:02,224
Bitch?

291
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,261
That's it.

292
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:04,710
You know what?

293
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,360
As much as I'm afraid I'm going to
make that walk that they have had,

294
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,580
did they have that?

295
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,770
They have it and I'm going to do it
regardless and it sounds more crazy.

296
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,750
I wouldn't be more afraid
of a guy that says,

297
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:16,680
I'm like,

298
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,910
who says I'm afraid,

299
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:21,360
but you know what I'm going to still
do with and I don't care if I'm afraid

300
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,080
bring it,

301
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,070
I'll do it like this.

302
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:25,230
It sound crazy to me more than a guy said,

303
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:25,591
oh no,

304
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:25,741
no,

305
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:26,011
no.

306
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:27,450
I'm not afraid because this guy,

307
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:27,931
he's a light.

308
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,310
He's afraid to say that he's afraid.

309
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:30,270
He's like,

310
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:30,840
man,

311
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,440
you know what I mean?

312
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,660
To me like personally,

313
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,533
that's what it is.

314
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,460
Yeah.

315
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,190
The posturing and posing.

316
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,390
It's unnecessary.

317
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,753
Exactly.

318
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,320
But you are afraid of aliens though,

319
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,010
right?

320
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,311
Yeah.

321
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:45,144
My friend.

322
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,623
Does it turn,

323
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,940
you have like a,

324
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,040
a path mapped out in your house.

325
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,960
How to get out of the aliens show up?

326
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,330
No,

327
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,403
that's the rule.

328
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,780
I heard you have a plan because I know
you like to use game plans had I know,

329
00:09:01,631 --> 00:09:03,310
I know cat ready and I know Jujitsu,

330
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,750
so the alley and show up.

331
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:09,210
I put a triangle choke on him and I
also have a cat that ammo so I Catana

332
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,090
Japanese get know.

333
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,920
So if they come I can slice them apart.

334
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,560
Wow.

335
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,930
You keep it stored in your house.

336
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,960
It's say it's a collection,

337
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:20,410
you know it's for me it's I have to to
burn or bring any crazy bitches home.

338
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,431
I man,

339
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:23,180
it's a sword and crazy bitches.

340
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,300
I have this tax all on the side of my
bed that I always forget is there and it

341
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,300
was like almost cut my
finger off all the time.

342
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,850
And you should put down in the garage,

343
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,550
big sword slash meat
cleaver that it's just

344
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,160
so do you really have a fear of aliens
or is this just a bullshit rumor?

345
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:44,970
It what didn't you do a countdown show
and you did a whole thing talking about

346
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,100
how you being scared of
being abducted by aliens.

347
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,040
Yeah,

348
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm scared.

349
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,900
I'm scared of a lot of thing,

350
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:50,734
you know?

351
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:53,751
I'll get,

352
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:54,650
I'll get into it.

353
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,740
I got,

354
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,660
I got,

355
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,330
I kept talking about
it right now and yeah,

356
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,260
I'm talking about it right now.

357
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,110
One day I will get to come out
and make a big thing about it,

358
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:03,590
but no,

359
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,340
right.

360
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,671
Hold on.

361
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,480
Hold on right now.

362
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,020
Yeah.

363
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,750
Have you ever had an
experience with aliens?

364
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,280
No.

365
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:10,451
No,

366
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:10,610
no,

367
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:10,730
no.

368
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,290
No.

369
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,123
I don't believe you.

370
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,810
I don't believe you.

371
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,720
I don't know.

372
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,420
I don't know.

373
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,861
You don't know.

374
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:19,010
You might have had an experience with
my manager going to have a heart attack

375
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:19,844
right now.

376
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,943
My brother

377
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,360
never do or lead you down any
path that's bad for your career.

378
00:10:25,361 --> 00:10:28,300
Just as you said that
it's good to be afraid.

379
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,160
It's also good to be
honest about everything.

380
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:30,641
Even shit.

381
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:31,480
That sounds crazy.

382
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,120
None of it does a thing.

383
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,500
I'm on s I like,

384
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,340
look,

385
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,140
I'm on s I'm afraid,

386
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,630
but I don't have to tell everything on,

387
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:40,510
on the phobic.

388
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,130
It's true.

389
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,963
You don't,

390
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,780
but you know it's an alien
because you're a smart guy.

391
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:46,251
Let me tell you,

392
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:47,340
you're a very smart guy.

393
00:10:47,341 --> 00:10:47,611
You know.

394
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:48,540
You know how to dig,

395
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,400
dig into people's mind.

396
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,320
And as I like you,

397
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,370
I hate that about you because
he put me on the spot right now.

398
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:57,750
But he's a very smart guy.

399
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,870
But now I know I gotta I
gotta go too deep into this.

400
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,740
And if I was on an alien spacecraft
and I had sex with an alien,

401
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,970
like I'm assuming you did,

402
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,420
I feel like I would just
come out and talk about it.

403
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,860
I don't know why you would hold that back.

404
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,641
No,

405
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:12,474
but I mean,

406
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,101
something happened,

407
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:14,934
George.

408
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,863
I don't know.

409
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:16,651
It's either,

410
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:18,530
it's either I'm crazy or,

411
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:19,200
or,

412
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,531
or,

413
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:19,890
uh,

414
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,970
maybe it really happened,

415
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,400
but I,

416
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,890
I hope that I'm crazy.

417
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,600
I don't think you're crazy.

418
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,583
I hope I am.

419
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
It could be pre crazy.

420
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,121
She didn't know.

421
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,340
Some people like some
great mine and you know,

422
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:29,681
they had,

423
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:33,500
they had been hallucinating
stuff or somebody bought
our [inaudible] say magneto

424
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,830
depressed or some people are,

425
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,664
are,

426
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:35,851
uh,

427
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:36,480
OCD.

428
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,320
Some people that are there,

429
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,850
some people are dead and they're still,

430
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,120
they've been able to achieve
great stuff on their life.

431
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,770
And also maybe I'm crazy when I was,

432
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,604
I don't know.

433
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,100
Are these experiences I can help you one
way or these experiences happening at

434
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:50,934
night?

435
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,230
I am not sure.

436
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:53,701
I have not.

437
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:54,534
I'm not sure.

438
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,750
Have any of these

439
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,890
variances happened while you've been in
the dream state or were you just been

440
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,930
dreaming or just asleep and you were

441
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,853
woken up?

442
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,320
I am not sure to that expert.

443
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,771
I don't know.

444
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,670
I don't remember anything.

445
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,910
But it was the worst at
nighttime type things.

446
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,420
Was it nighttime when you think you
might have had something happen to you?

447
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,320
Uh,

448
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,720
I can't say something happened to me.

449
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,130
I have no proof.

450
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,660
I just don't know.

451
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:23,610
What I'm going to tell you about is your
brain produces a chemical while you're

452
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:24,260
sleeping,

453
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,801
but I've got it.

454
00:12:24,801 --> 00:12:28,630
I'm going to tell you something and I'm
going to be honest about it sometime.

455
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,560
Um,

456
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,560
I'm looking at the clock and it's like I
wake up and I look at the cracker right

457
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:41,861
after I started and it's like the clock
had events like a four hour or two

458
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,154
hours.

459
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,740
There's a time zone that I
don't remember what happened.

460
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,150
It's called falling asleep.

461
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:48,763
I hope so.

462
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,500
What do you think you think you're
getting snatched up and take it away for a

463
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,333
couple hours.

464
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,500
Maybe I fall asleep.

465
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,400
That's why I hoped.

466
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,590
That's why I hope or I can drive.

467
00:12:57,591 --> 00:12:58,580
I can drive my car,

468
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,750
I can drive my car.

469
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,250
And then it already happened.

470
00:13:01,251 --> 00:13:01,551
I drove,

471
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:02,390
I drove my car.

472
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,040
[inaudible] I dunno,

473
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,630
I drove my car in a normal day,

474
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,070
like going somewhere.

475
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,050
Then I look and this two
hour pass and like two hour,

476
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:13,790
I would just pass like this.

477
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,150
Like maybe,

478
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,420
maybe I didn't see it.

479
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,240
Maybe I didn't.

480
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,601
I didn't,

481
00:13:17,601 --> 00:13:18,590
I didn't.

482
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,900
I maybe I watched their tiny the wrong.

483
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,680
Like I watched my clock and I
made a mistake myself most likely,

484
00:13:24,681 --> 00:13:25,370
right?

485
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:25,820
Yes,

486
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,211
of course.

487
00:13:26,211 --> 00:13:26,630
My hope.

488
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,350
I hope so.

489
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,120
Well that's very minor stuff.

490
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,290
That's very minor stuff.

491
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:30,740
Yeah.

492
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,160
Um,

493
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,020
but that could be,

494
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,930
you talked being tired because
you push yourself and less stress.

495
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,853
It's exactly,

496
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,330
that's exactly what I hope.

497
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:38,661
So.

498
00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:39,950
It's exactly what I hope so.

499
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,130
But you don't have any memories of great
dudes putting fingers up your butt?

500
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,341
No,

501
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:43,850
I don't.

502
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,410
None of that.

503
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:44,851
I got it,

504
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:45,051
Joe,

505
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,210
where you're driving down the street,

506
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:48,790
like on the highway and you're just
like kind of dazed out and you're like,

507
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:49,001
wait,

508
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:49,834
how long I've been,

509
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,170
I've,

510
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,120
I've been dazed out for like 20 minutes.

511
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,640
What have I been doing for 20 minutes?

512
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,000
Autopilot.

513
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,391
Yeah.

514
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:55,991
And then like,

515
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,030
you just realize like almost
all of a sudden your home.

516
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,480
Yeah.

517
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,130
But,

518
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,550
um,

519
00:13:59,550 --> 00:13:59,760
the,

520
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,900
the thing about being exhausted and sleep,

521
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:02,651
you know,

522
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,390
and having these experiences at night,

523
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:04,961
they,

524
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:05,561
there's a,

525
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,570
a chemical your brain makes that's,

526
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:07,960
uh,

527
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,930
one of the most powerful
psychedelic drugs don't demand.

528
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,420
So one of the things
they're trying to connect,

529
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,560
it's called DMT.

530
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,480
And one of the things
they're trying to connect is,

531
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,320
um,

532
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,060
people having near death experiences
and people that have had UFO alien

533
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,540
abduction type experiences and this
chemical and that they can introduce this

534
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,860
chemical into the human body.

535
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:31,540
And these people have very
similar experiences to what
they had when they had a

536
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,730
Ufo encounter or when they had,

537
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,061
you know,

538
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:37,000
a white light near death
experience counter.

539
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,000
It's most likely there's this
chemical that's doing this.

540
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,810
So when people having these experiences,

541
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,770
they're very realistic and they do
believe they're being taken aboard by,

542
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,300
you know,

543
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,530
a Ufo somewhere.

544
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,030
They might not be wrong,

545
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,070
but this is not a Ufo encounter.

546
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,050
Boyd's

547
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,440
and then that the firefighting or job,

548
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:53,910
right?

549
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:54,743
Object.

550
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,090
This the I encounter.

551
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,060
Are we talking about that?

552
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,070
If they've been taking a board,

553
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,461
this is,

554
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,211
this is different.

555
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:00,631
It's like,

556
00:15:00,631 --> 00:15:01,230
hey,

557
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,210
it could be a third type and commentary.

558
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,640
There's many ways,

559
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,511
but this is different.

560
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:06,810
Yeah.

561
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,643
But I,

562
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,780
I you talk about me,

563
00:15:09,781 --> 00:15:10,441
I don't have any,

564
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:12,300
I don't have any memory of such team,

565
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,680
but I think I had like,

566
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:13,981
I have,

567
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:14,461
like you say,

568
00:15:14,461 --> 00:15:15,151
sometimes I fall,

569
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:15,901
I fall asleep,

570
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,880
then I wake up is the time pass.

571
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:18,331
And I'm like,

572
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:19,164
well,

573
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,210
it's like I just,

574
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,480
cause you're tired man.

575
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:22,740
Aliens.

576
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,030
Yeah,

577
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,250
no worried.

578
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:24,511
He like,

579
00:15:24,511 --> 00:15:25,020
man,

580
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:25,830
maybe it's alien.

581
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,760
It's kind of what you do.

582
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:27,121
No,

583
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,140
it's because I am,

584
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,190
I felt like I didn't fall,

585
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,220
I didn't fall asleep and I'm not tired.

586
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:32,821
I'm wide awake,

587
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:33,654
awake,

588
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,370
but I fall asleep rag this,

589
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:35,910
I just Kinda,

590
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,520
I mean it's kind of weird
these onto hard sparring days.

591
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,300
No,

592
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,660
no,

593
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,530
just a normal day.

594
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,860
Negative could happen everyday.

595
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,290
Just get a Gopro like a camera and
just record yourself all the time.

596
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,143
That happens.

597
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,660
Watch it recorded for like
eight hours at a time.

598
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:52,440
Some of them.

599
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,740
Yeah.

600
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,790
How long has this been going on?

601
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,893
Since I'm a kid.

602
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,003
Wow.

603
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,893
Wow.

604
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,460
Wouldn't it be crazy if,

605
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,060
uh,

606
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,060
the aliens like manufactured you
to be a mixed martial arts fighter?

607
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:06,150
They're like,

608
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,983
let's see if we could,

609
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm sure if it would have happened,

610
00:16:09,661 --> 00:16:11,070
I would have been much better than,

611
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:11,521
than,

612
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:12,300
than this.

613
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,111
Much better than this.

614
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:14,040
You're the fucking champion.

615
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:14,551
Yeah.

616
00:16:14,551 --> 00:16:15,680
But if I would be at here,

617
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,281
the manufacturer,

618
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:17,610
I would it be superman,

619
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:17,940
you know?

620
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,121
Well,

621
00:16:18,121 --> 00:16:19,700
they just don't want to
get ridiculous with it.

622
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,190
It would be,

623
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:21,670
yeah,

624
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,120
it would be obviously can't turn a guy
into what God damn superhero maybe didn't

625
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,570
manufacture on Anderson Silva.

626
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,381
Jon Jones.

627
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:30,350
Maybe they did the Aldo.

628
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,850
Maybe someone needs to talk to
them about their sleep patterns.

629
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,430
Maybe they're falling asleep behind the
wheel too and being sucked to board a

630
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,720
space ship for repairs.

631
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,520
Maybe they don't want to talk about it.

632
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,540
Maybe they don't say it,

633
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,141
but maybe they are.

634
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:40,620
I don't know.

635
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,061
I don't know.

636
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:42,740
I know I'm the print that and they,

637
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,250
I think it's funny though,

638
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,640
that that's maybe one subject,

639
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,211
but you,

640
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:46,690
uh,

641
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:47,380
you have,

642
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,060
you had a really hard
time talking about that.

643
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,820
I do.

644
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,190
Cause it sounds crazy.

645
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,670
Yes.

646
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,300
And I know,

647
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,100
and I will talk about it one day.

648
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,830
I'm going to talk about my fear,

649
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,210
my,

650
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,150
all of that stuff and yeah.

651
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,093
Ah,

652
00:16:59,300 --> 00:16:59,601
no,

653
00:16:59,601 --> 00:16:59,931
no,

654
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:00,120
I,

655
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,410
I don't get deep into this.

656
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,641
Yeah.

657
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,420
Maybe one day I'll,

658
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:05,360
I'll,

659
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:05,641
I'll,

660
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:05,941
I'll,

661
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,774
I'll talk about that.

662
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,230
It's not what you promised one day.

663
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:09,671
I promise.

664
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:10,504
One day.

665
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,510
What is the difference note tomorrow.

666
00:17:12,511 --> 00:17:16,560
Didn't you see rocky three when Apollo
creed says that the rocky Balboa,

667
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,401
or like you said,

668
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:17,521
may,

669
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:17,911
maybe,

670
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,200
maybe I will die one day.

671
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,460
Maybe I'll die it tomorrow.

672
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,490
I hope I touched wasn't
nothing and that people,

673
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:23,010
oh.

674
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,820
And I'm like,

675
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,020
how did you say that it was that French?

676
00:17:25,021 --> 00:17:25,910
I touched with nuts.

677
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,380
I touched the,

678
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,030
wouldn't let it happen,

679
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:30,864
you know?

680
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

681
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,910
It just let it go.

682
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,470
Just whatever information you've got,

683
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:35,221
spill it now.

684
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:35,881
But I don't know.

685
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:36,541
I'm doing my,

686
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,800
I'm doing my own research.

687
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:40,560
I'm researching on myself
as I think you know,

688
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:42,810
you just told me he's a very
interesting day chemical.

689
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:47,400
That buddy that's probably that I'm happy
that I meet through today and you tell

690
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,010
that about me because
I make me make me up.

691
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:50,670
You know?

692
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,690
It'll make you think like,

693
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,320
I think a lot of people think
they're going crazy and it's not.

694
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:56,460
It's just your brain
makes like a duck trucks.

695
00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:57,540
It's true.

696
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,810
Your brain produces it and parts
of your liver and your lungs,

697
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,180
they don't know why this
stuff is in the body,

698
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,780
but it's,

699
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,000
it's a super potent psychedelic.

700
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,323
Your brain makes it,

701
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,030
it happens when you're sleeping.

702
00:18:09,031 --> 00:18:12,480
So if like the speculation is
that it happens during rem sleep.

703
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,570
I don't think they have the most
accurate way of measuring it,

704
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,630
but they know it's in the body
and they believe it's the,

705
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:22,560
the theory is that it comes out during
periods of heavy stress or when your body

706
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,880
thinks it's going to die or in rem sleep
and that those are the Times that you

707
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,870
have higher levels of this stuff
in your neurochemical soup.

708
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,633
That's an interesting,

709
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,150
crazy,

710
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,080
why would you brain,

711
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,980
why would your brain produce an
incredibly potent psychedelic drug?

712
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,220
So a lot of people that are having
these nighttime experiences,

713
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,840
it could be just varying levels of this
chemical that's a going around in your

714
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:46,050
brain,

715
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,120
but that doesn't mean that
these experiences aren't real.

716
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,280
We don't know what the
fuck sleeping is anyway.

717
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:50,641
I mean,

718
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:51,474
what is sleeping?

719
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,560
You shut your eyes,

720
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:53,430
you shut off,

721
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:57,000
you don't exist in this plane and your
consciousness goes somewhere else.

722
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,680
Like literally you have no memory of a
giant chunk of your day and we have no

723
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:06,070
problem with it and yet we don't
connect it to any other realm or the,

724
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,220
the idea of there being other dimensions.

725
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:10,140
You go into another dimension
when you go to sleep,

726
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,651
okay,

727
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:11,400
you do,

728
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,330
you just shut off.

729
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:13,164
You stop.

730
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,940
And for all intents and purposes,

731
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:16,500
you are in another dimension.

732
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,300
And if while you're in
that other dimension,

733
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:22,320
your brain is being pumped
with this psychedelic chemical
that when you take it,

734
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:24,810
when you're sober makes you have
these incredible experiences.

735
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,033
It only seems to,

736
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,820
it just seems like a
normal thing to look into.

737
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,600
Like people should be looking into that.

738
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:30,961
Like,

739
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,240
what?

740
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,610
What is what is happening?

741
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:33,510
When you're sleeping,

742
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,770
you're asleep.

743
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,820
You go away.

744
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,440
And everybody's just so used to it.

745
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:37,681
They're like,

746
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:38,514
no big deal.

747
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,750
We just go away.

748
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,340
Just go away for eight hours a day.

749
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:42,121
You know,

750
00:19:42,121 --> 00:19:45,030
everybody's scared to die and
no one's scared to fall asleep.

751
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,131
You're,

752
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:46,531
you're just,

753
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:47,970
you're shutting off man.

754
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,050
He know you're going to be back.

755
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:49,884
So you're not worried,

756
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,060
but you're shutting off.

757
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,230
Whatever that is,

758
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:52,981
you know,

759
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:54,180
is just accepted.

760
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,040
If sleeping didn't exist,

761
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,440
it would be the craziest fucking thing.

762
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,420
If all of a sudden you told people that
they had to shut off for eight hours a

763
00:20:01,421 --> 00:20:02,910
night and just completely not be,

764
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,571
they'd be like,

765
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:04,530
what are you talking about?

766
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,670
I got to shut off.

767
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,030
They'll,

768
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,421
but yeah,

769
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:09,090
you're going to shut off for eight hours
a night and you're not going to know

770
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:09,924
what's happening.

771
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,940
People can touch your balls
while you're sleeping.

772
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,950
He loves no way of stopping them.

773
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,420
He's a lot of things that can happen.

774
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,671
I showed it as like you said,

775
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:17,270
we don't know.

776
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,780
We don't know.

777
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,010
We don't know what the fuck that is.

778
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,690
I could,

779
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,180
I could like,

780
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:20,811
you know what I can say?

781
00:20:20,811 --> 00:20:22,370
It's not that I'm afraid to be crazy.

782
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:23,021
It's just I,

783
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,050
I can say whatever dad,

784
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:26,870
I won't and we don't know maybe.

785
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:27,561
You know what I mean?

786
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:28,071
We don't know.

787
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:28,881
We don't know the truth.

788
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:29,710
We'd have no idea.

789
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,640
Somebody might be stealing time from you.

790
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,170
They might be stealing time.

791
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:33,411
You're like,

792
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,190
this motherfucker's got to the true.

793
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,063
It is.

794
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,980
I feel like I had experience,

795
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,180
but they don't know what it is.

796
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:45,290
So for me to say it said yet or say
it's a dead drug chemical you're talking

797
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:45,530
about,

798
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,190
I don't know.

799
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:46,521
I can't,

800
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,500
I can't tell right now.

801
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:48,821
I don't know what it is,

802
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:49,654
but I did,

803
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,493
I felt,

804
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,450
and I get good to have
been an experience or not.

805
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,870
Maybe I felt maybe I'm crazy and it's
the normal thing that everybody would

806
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,080
like.

807
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,913
Maybe I,

808
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,031
but right now I,

809
00:20:58,031 --> 00:20:58,450
uh,

810
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:58,661
like,

811
00:20:58,661 --> 00:20:58,991
I don't know.

812
00:20:58,991 --> 00:20:59,630
It's too,

813
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,810
I'm making my own research
too to found out about that.

814
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,830
How are you researching?

815
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,200
And I research a lot of stuff.

816
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:05,650
Uh,

817
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,040
they committed their reason things and uh,

818
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,340
go on the Internet now.

819
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:10,840
It's another thing that
he just said to me.

820
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:12,890
I'm going to research that
Maine by research on the room.

821
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,340
I maybe by research things
that people that have,

822
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,160
I've tried because that lap lap
sauce time that you don't remember,

823
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:18,461
they've been,

824
00:21:18,461 --> 00:21:20,220
some people been hypnotized on the ad.

825
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:20,831
The bad,

826
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,360
the bad,

827
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:22,840
the,

828
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,531
you know what I mean?

829
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:24,221
Is that venture,

830
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:25,510
and I don't want to be an uptight.

831
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,211
Well,

832
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:28,040
that was very controversial.

833
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,031
You know the,

834
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:30,980
what's happening during hypnosis,

835
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:32,030
hypnotic regression.

836
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:35,510
It's very controversial because there's
a lot of people that believe that you

837
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:38,990
can introduce fake memories and to
a person while they're unconscious,

838
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:40,040
and then you could,

839
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:40,470
you know,

840
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,630
you,

841
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,941
you,

842
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:45,470
you could steer the events in one way or
another and introduced false memories.

843
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,190
It's not,

844
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,180
it's not very,

845
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,290
it's not very reliable.

846
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:49,310
I don't think so.

847
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:52,670
That's one of the big things about these
people that have these crazy stories

848
00:21:52,671 --> 00:21:53,720
from hypnotic regression.

849
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,370
Like what the fuck is really going on?

850
00:21:55,371 --> 00:21:55,581
You know,

851
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:56,330
you don't know.

852
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,780
A lot of times people that are in therapy
in the first place or a little wound,

853
00:21:59,781 --> 00:22:00,170
Doris,

854
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,650
of course.

855
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,810
So it's that those are the
type of people that you're,

856
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:03,471
you're dealing with.

857
00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:04,610
You're hypnotizing them.

858
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,060
And then you're finding out about
these nutty experiences with aliens.

859
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,320
Who knows what the fuck

860
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,080
you're really,

861
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,800
it so credit.

862
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:12,634
He's just the same.

863
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,220
You take a fish and they'll water.

864
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,300
Okay.

865
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,930
And that fisheries,

866
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:17,763
it isn't.

867
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,270
And then as that environment,

868
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,530
let's say a fisherman,

869
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:21,940
he grabbed a fish in the water,

870
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,530
it pulls it off the water,

871
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:24,364
look at him,

872
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,411
look at meg,

873
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,390
the official guy around and
drop the fish back in the water.

874
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,400
The fish after is going to go back to
his friend and he's going to tell it.

875
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,660
The other efficient man,

876
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,760
I build it out of the water in and it was,

877
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,460
the people were breeding
area was another environment.

878
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:40,870
I saw a human being pulled,

879
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,831
you know,

880
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:42,131
like,

881
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:43,450
and men grabbing me,

882
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:44,290
I saw trees,

883
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,850
I saw a bird in the sky.

884
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,571
I saw,

885
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:47,470
I like,

886
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:47,840
Eh,

887
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,611
like I son,

888
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:49,121
I'm like,

889
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:52,030
I see a different thing
in different universe.

890
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,050
And then you put it back.

891
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,890
The other official thing,

892
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,910
he's completely insane,

893
00:22:54,911 --> 00:22:55,744
you know?

894
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,230
So maybe in a way we're all like fish and,

895
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,730
and maybe there is something
and you said that when you see,

896
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:07,600
but another university or another or
well or something and we don't know and

897
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:08,411
we're right next to it,

898
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:09,244
but we don't know.

899
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,140
And if that's what I'm doing,

900
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:11,561
research,

901
00:23:11,561 --> 00:23:12,180
I want to see,

902
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,511
you know,

903
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:12,650
I,

904
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,960
when I grow as a human being,

905
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:14,470
fine,

906
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,850
what was the truth?

907
00:23:15,851 --> 00:23:19,530
Even though I probably will never found
out the truth and I want to get close

908
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,170
circles or,

909
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,570
and find my own research to see what,

910
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,301
what's happening,

911
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:22,580
you know,

912
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,970
and we're all in the same pattern.

913
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:25,380
You know,

914
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,220
you know what I think the problem with
fine people wanting to find the truth is

915
00:23:29,221 --> 00:23:30,330
there is no truth.

916
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,740
There are truths.

917
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,120
I think there is no one truth and everyone
is like [inaudible] I hope to find

918
00:23:36,121 --> 00:23:36,601
the truth.

919
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:37,560
Like what are you talking about?

920
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:38,490
It's not one thing.

921
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,720
There's truths,

922
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,460
there's a lot of information.

923
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,390
There's a lot of stuff.

924
00:23:42,391 --> 00:23:43,500
And to call it the truth,

925
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:45,610
like to figure out the whole big thing.

926
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,320
It's almost impossible for our brains
to it to grasp like an aunt doesn't know

927
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:52,180
what a cell phone tower is.

928
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,800
It's,

929
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,400
it's almost impossible for our
brains to grasp the enormity of,

930
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:58,600
you know,

931
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,780
going from protons and cells and,

932
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:02,200
uh,

933
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,940
an animal and a planet and
a galaxy in a universe,

934
00:24:06,941 --> 00:24:08,500
in multiple universes.

935
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:10,900
And it's not too much with,

936
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:14,590
this was just no way you're going to
be able to take all the things that are

937
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:18,790
going in all over the world and understand
it all and understand the pieces that

938
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,624
it falls into.

939
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,560
It's not possible.

940
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,730
So this whole thing where it was like,

941
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,271
I'm going to,

942
00:24:22,271 --> 00:24:22,541
you know,

943
00:24:22,541 --> 00:24:23,740
hopefully I find the truth.

944
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:24,940
You will find truths.

945
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,361
It's,

946
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:28,720
you'll never find the truth
cause you're a a monkey.

947
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,230
Well private,

948
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,430
nothing that we're not smart enough.

949
00:24:31,431 --> 00:24:31,870
We're not that.

950
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,300
Yeah,

951
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,880
that sound,

952
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,310
what did you say?

953
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,561
We are,

954
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:34,394
we are,

955
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,410
we're being birthed into a whole new
universe of information that's never

956
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,430
existed for any previous human beings.

957
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,930
And we're not designed for it.

958
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,520
We're not designed to process this,

959
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:49,910
were designed to figure out where the
deer going or designed to figure out who

960
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:50,780
do you want to fuck.

961
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,250
We're designed to think this guy,

962
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:53,720
he's probably going to
take over my village,

963
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:54,530
this con.

964
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,480
And that's how we're designed.

965
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,120
And then within the last 10,000 years,

966
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:00,830
that has become,

967
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,281
you know,

968
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:04,790
watching like space documentaries
and getting on the Internet.

969
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,230
And if it's too much,

970
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:06,981
it's no,

971
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:07,641
there's no way.

972
00:25:07,641 --> 00:25:08,121
There's no way.

973
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:09,890
You know exactly what's
going on over the world.

974
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:10,770
You'll go crazy.

975
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:12,150
You don't have the time.

976
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,780
It will take a lot of time
in and it's still yeah.

977
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,653
To acclimate.

978
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,041
I agree.

979
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:17,321
100.

980
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,154
What's up with that?

981
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,860
Have you heard of like a lot
of these guys like Dan Hardee,

982
00:25:20,861 --> 00:25:24,700
did this go into Peru and they
take those Iowasca ceremonies?

983
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,683
Did you hear about that?

984
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,170
No.

985
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,003
You didn't hear about that?

986
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,060
Um,

987
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,710
Dan Hardee did it again.

988
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,720
Wait to get him on the podcast
and talk to him about it.

989
00:25:31,721 --> 00:25:33,130
But he said it changed his whole life.

990
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,750
And it's the same thing.

991
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:35,584
It's DMT.

992
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,810
It's these Amazon Indians.

993
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,020
They,

994
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,310
they make it in a,

995
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,840
a brew and the active ingredient
is in this brew is DMT.

996
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:48,841
And they have the ceremonies and they
all get together and they'll play music.

997
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:53,050
And this guy like blows tobacco smoke in
your face and he'd drink this stuff and

998
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,690
an hour and 20 minutes later
they enter into the spirit world,

999
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,150
have life changing visions,

1000
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,300
the wildest physical manifestations of
your imagination you could ever possibly

1001
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,520
think of and dream of.

1002
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,600
You can't even think about it.

1003
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:07,961
You can't,

1004
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:09,400
you can't even put into words.

1005
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,050
And it's legal in Peru,

1006
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:11,561
you know,

1007
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:13,150
it's legal and parts of South America.

1008
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:14,500
So people are going down there.

1009
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,920
This Americans are going down there on a
regular basis and having these shamanic

1010
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:18,371
rituals,

1011
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:19,780
life changing rituals,

1012
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,840
and it's all based on the same thing
that comes out of your brain when you're

1013
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:23,360
dreaming.

1014
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,780
Yeah.

1015
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,040
Yeah.

1016
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,820
Pretty nutty.

1017
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:24,991
Yeah.

1018
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:25,261
You could,

1019
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:27,750
I could make you realize
things I'd like just say,

1020
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:28,680
learn about yourself,

1021
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,040
you know?

1022
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,873
Do you meditate?

1023
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,360
I wouldn't not say meditate.

1024
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,650
I would say visualizing.

1025
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,493
Yes.

1026
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,210
Yeah.

1027
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,830
So it's specific tasks in mind.

1028
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,400
Like,

1029
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,580
like visualizing fight strategies,

1030
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,550
fights,

1031
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:42,990
visualizing what I want in my,

1032
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,210
uh,

1033
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,820
what,

1034
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,181
you know,

1035
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:45,991
where I want it to be.

1036
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:49,530
In 20 years I've tried to visualize
where I could be and what I want.

1037
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:49,920
You know,

1038
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,850
it could be about fight,

1039
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,920
could be about uh,

1040
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,550
anything.

1041
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,470
Cause we have all the,

1042
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,510
my training and one hour where I went,

1043
00:26:57,511 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm going to do and you know about
everything could be in business,

1044
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,763
you know,

1045
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,940
it could be when I'm going to meet,

1046
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,750
uh,

1047
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,780
someone when I'm going to say or you know,

1048
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:06,780
could be an easy thing.

1049
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,260
Do you have very specific like goals,

1050
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,041
like for your life?

1051
00:27:10,041 --> 00:27:11,320
Do you have written down?

1052
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,150
Yes,

1053
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:12,900
I do.

1054
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,770
Do you write them down?

1055
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,240
Yeah.

1056
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,761
Have goals?

1057
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:15,594
Yeah.

1058
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:16,200
So I'm a,

1059
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,580
I wrote it down some I don't,

1060
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:17,971
but the,

1061
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:18,360
I do,

1062
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,950
I do have a specific goal.

1063
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,300
I have goals from like everybody,

1064
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,950
I have a bigger goal in this much bigger,

1065
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,520
much bigger goal than you.

1066
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:25,920
For example,

1067
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,090
are you going to be
president of the world?

1068
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:27,721
None of it.

1069
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:28,460
I want to be for if,

1070
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:28,891
for example,

1071
00:27:28,891 --> 00:27:30,600
one of my goals is like,

1072
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,430
like is to have a,

1073
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:33,061
to be married,

1074
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:35,100
have a wife with a,

1075
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,180
at least five kids,

1076
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,660
four or five kids minimum.

1077
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,490
Wow.

1078
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,241
When I have a lot of kids,

1079
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,074
that's one of my goal.

1080
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,093
That's my goal.

1081
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,750
And that's,

1082
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,531
I'm not there yet,

1083
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:44,311
but it's one of my goals.

1084
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:44,850
You know,

1085
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,190
I don't think you're going to have
a problem finding a nice lady.

1086
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,780
Finalize Lady.

1087
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,300
I can get along with that.

1088
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:52,140
That's a,

1089
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:52,831
well,

1090
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:53,491
I think you better.

1091
00:27:53,491 --> 00:27:56,760
I've had a lot of kids look up in Canada,

1092
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,510
Japan,

1093
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,343
that's what you need to ask.

1094
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,560
Don't be trying to get
these American checks.

1095
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,663
They'll get mouthy,

1096
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,520
especially after you retire.

1097
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:05,911
Oh,

1098
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:07,750
lucky you all retired and shit game.

1099
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,900
That's a little flaky.

1100
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,621
Do you,

1101
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:12,070
um,

1102
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,310
do you have like a clear
timeline as to when you're,

1103
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:17,230
you're going to discontinue
your fighting career?

1104
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:17,561
No,

1105
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:18,160
I don't.

1106
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,730
I don't want,

1107
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,410
I just,

1108
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:19,670
uh,

1109
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,140
I didn't,

1110
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,951
I didn't blend this.

1111
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,220
Now I'm focusing on my
camera right now and uh,

1112
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:27,430
wanted to be the best at
what I do and I want to,

1113
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:28,120
uh,

1114
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,660
make the,

1115
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,790
be the guy that made the
difference in this park.

1116
00:28:30,791 --> 00:28:31,090
You know,

1117
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,620
bringing the sport is UFC grow
and be more mainstream everywhere.

1118
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,181
Well,

1119
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,520
you've already done that
just by being who you are.

1120
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,060
You know,

1121
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,691
by your,

1122
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:40,620
your personality.

1123
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,981
You know,

1124
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:41,341
your,

1125
00:28:41,341 --> 00:28:45,570
your ability to just be a normal guy
who just so happens to be one of the

1126
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:46,260
baddest motherfucker

1127
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,093
cause on the planet.

1128
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,681
Yeah.

1129
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:47,921
But uh,

1130
00:28:47,921 --> 00:28:48,310
you know,

1131
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,830
I just,

1132
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,663
I it still is.

1133
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,520
Lot Of,

1134
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,250
I love to do it and some
kind of treated it's illegal,

1135
00:28:54,251 --> 00:28:54,531
you know,

1136
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:55,364
and on a

1137
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,880
right,

1138
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,241
sure.

1139
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:58,610
There's still a lot of work to
do as far as the spread of MMA,

1140
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,930
not just some countries,

1141
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,140
some states it's still
illegal in New York state.

1142
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:03,590
When I first started.

1143
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,340
Yeah.

1144
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,310
And while I'm from my country,

1145
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,940
it was a Daigo and kind of doing,

1146
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:08,540
you know,

1147
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,081
they did,

1148
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:09,220
they,

1149
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,700
it wasn't that sanction and everything.

1150
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:11,151
So this,

1151
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:11,570
I'm happy,

1152
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,890
at least where I live now it's,

1153
00:29:12,891 --> 00:29:14,870
it's good and it's very popular.

1154
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,461
Yeah.

1155
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:16,910
I watched your first fights,

1156
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,260
man.

1157
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,480
I watched you in the Tko organization.

1158
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,020
Yeah.

1159
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,411
Yeah.

1160
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:21,400
I watch all those,

1161
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,090
you know,

1162
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:22,691
it's a,

1163
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:23,430
I've always

1164
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,961
been a big,

1165
00:29:23,961 --> 00:29:26,630
big fan of MMA and I think that it's,

1166
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,780
it's so important that there's all
these other organizations going on like,

1167
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:30,051
you know,

1168
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:30,580
like that,

1169
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,790
that MFC up in Canada and it used
to be strike force and you know,

1170
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:36,530
now this Bella Tor is doing really well.

1171
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:41,060
It's like so important to have a bunch
of different outlets for guys to pursue

1172
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,010
careers.

1173
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,590
But up in Canada was just
like that Tko organization.

1174
00:29:44,591 --> 00:29:44,861
Right.

1175
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:45,930
And then a couple anymore.

1176
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,211
Yeah,

1177
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:49,090
it was pretty much I'll need t that
TK when you guys fought in a ring.

1178
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,081
Yeah.

1179
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:51,130
It wasn't hearing back down.

1180
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:51,880
Yeah.

1181
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,770
What do you do some guys prefer the ring.

1182
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:54,480
What do you prefer?

1183
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,731
No,

1184
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:55,270
the cage.

1185
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:55,840
The cage.

1186
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,081
Yeah.

1187
00:29:56,081 --> 00:29:56,914
The ring is,

1188
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,510
it's not the environment,

1189
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,403
uh,

1190
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,230
the cage as better or I
would read or do like,

1191
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,980
uh,

1192
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,360
add the cages perfect.

1193
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,141
As circular,

1194
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:09,250
like octagon or a circular cage
or even better than entering.

1195
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,120
That would be like a platform where it,

1196
00:30:12,121 --> 00:30:13,810
where there is no walls.

1197
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,030
There is a like a

1198
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,370
like align,

1199
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,120
align.

1200
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,280
No,

1201
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,401
no,

1202
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,031
you don't fall.

1203
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:21,450
But there is a line and if you
step across and I didn't put you,

1204
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,310
they put you back but there was
a line and then there was a,

1205
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,250
I beg you it so you don't
fall about this platform and

1206
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:28,740
yeah,

1207
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,600
I see what you're saying.

1208
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,670
That's the Super League and it's a
bit like wrestling assuming yeah.

1209
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,461
Kind of similar.

1210
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:35,611
Yeah,

1211
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:36,061
exactly.

1212
00:30:36,061 --> 00:30:37,140
Then it wouldn't be good too.

1213
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:37,591
Yeah,

1214
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:38,490
that's not a bad idea.

1215
00:30:38,491 --> 00:30:40,170
It's just a space consideration.

1216
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,730
Probably the exact ad on know for sure.

1217
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:43,330
Exactly what want some Brock Lesnar do.

1218
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:45,210
Just steamroll and someone
write into the crowd.

1219
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:45,841
It's true.

1220
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:46,651
And I know that would be,

1221
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:47,510
that wouldn't be a quarter but,

1222
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,190
but something like that or you know,

1223
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:51,024
I think they got,

1224
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,420
you know,

1225
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,201
the the cage.

1226
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:52,860
It's pretty good.

1227
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:52,931
Yeah,

1228
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,090
no it's a good day surface.

1229
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:54,841
Yeah.

1230
00:30:54,841 --> 00:30:59,160
The only objection that people have as
fans and sometimes it makes the action a

1231
00:30:59,161 --> 00:30:59,641
little harder.

1232
00:30:59,641 --> 00:31:00,960
See Two there,

1233
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,440
you know,

1234
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,221
watching it at home,

1235
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:02,940
it's perfect.

1236
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,160
I'm sure they could make a,

1237
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,633
I meant Ariel,

1238
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,140
which is like a window that could
see truet like a plastic window.

1239
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,010
Turn it off racy and shit.

1240
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,200
Every time dudes would be like that.

1241
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:16,180
Daniel Cromey a frank Mir fight happened.

1242
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,450
Sure.

1243
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,550
The whole thing would be just grease.

1244
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,330
You wouldn't be able
to see shit cause they,

1245
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,560
those guys pressed up against
every spot on that cage.

1246
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,180
Sure.

1247
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,911
It's awesome girl.

1248
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:28,750
I'm in May now and it can be like a
carwash liquor at girl and the main car.

1249
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,173
I'm sure there is.

1250
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,540
There's a lot of things I
would've changed at this point.

1251
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:35,530
First of all the time.

1252
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,393
There's no time,

1253
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,233
no round.

1254
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,643
I think he's,

1255
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,360
I think seriously.

1256
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,300
I believe it's stupid.

1257
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,560
The wrong one.

1258
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:41,810
I see.

1259
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,520
Was the best mountain.

1260
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,390
Let them fight,

1261
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,224
you know,

1262
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,230
15 minutes or maybe 25
minutes for the championship.

1263
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:47,541
No.

1264
00:31:47,541 --> 00:31:47,890
Around.

1265
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,850
And why did that round,

1266
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:50,170
why we tried to be like boxing,

1267
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:50,530
you know,

1268
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,380
or not boxers.

1269
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,270
They did.

1270
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:56,620
They did the round to be like
boxing to be accepted as a sport.

1271
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,450
It would probably be a lot more finishes.

1272
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,400
It wasn't,

1273
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,233
no.

1274
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,240
Yeah of course.

1275
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,800
100% no round.

1276
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:03,071
You know,

1277
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:03,641
and I got this,

1278
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:04,540
this is ridiculous.

1279
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,570
I mean I like it.

1280
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,361
Me,

1281
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:06,750
me,

1282
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:06,980
me.

1283
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,660
It's a receipt.

1284
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,870
Do you think it's possible
that the UFC would you,

1285
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,241
would you,

1286
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:13,570
would you fight someone like
that 100% to arrange that?

1287
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:15,100
Like as a particular rule,

1288
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:18,130
like maybe the UFC could do it in Russia
or somewhere where they're gangster

1289
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:18,610
about it.

1290
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:18,851
Yeah,

1291
00:32:18,851 --> 00:32:19,080
I would,

1292
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,570
I would,

1293
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,620
I would rather like,

1294
00:32:20,621 --> 00:32:21,560
I would rather fight it.

1295
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,390
A rule like this.

1296
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,300
I think it would be more honest like
it who's that better than a man at that

1297
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,370
fight that could have happened in pride.

1298
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:30,700
They did that and pride right with this
isn't hoists Gracie have a 90 minute

1299
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,150
match with Sakharova.

1300
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,250
But I think that was like,

1301
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,470
even then it was like that.

1302
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,360
That's when they used
to be the real thing,

1303
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:37,740
you know,

1304
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,321
back in the day.

1305
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:43,321
That's why I have so much respect for
these guy is a Coleman Dan Severn cause he

1306
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:44,300
had a pioneer,

1307
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:44,730
you know.

1308
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,350
Oh yeah.

1309
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,950
The no,

1310
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:46,820
no time limit.

1311
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,370
I roll word.

1312
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,643
Yeah.

1313
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,530
This crazy glasses.

1314
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,500
Joseph know who else have Joe?

1315
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:59,810
Sam became like a Fred
ocdish jail gang rape.

1316
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,010
Oh my God.

1317
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:01,281
Really?

1318
00:33:01,281 --> 00:33:01,650
Yeah.

1319
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,070
Joe Sando is a part of a gang rape I,

1320
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:04,241
yes,

1321
00:33:04,241 --> 00:33:04,350
sir.

1322
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:04,880
Yes.

1323
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,151
Yeah.

1324
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,760
Apparently they didn't know what they
arrested him for something else and got

1325
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:12,040
his DNA and connecting it to
a gang rape fall years by,

1326
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,033
yeah.

1327
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,050
I'm wondering what happened to the,

1328
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,800
like somebody at a guy like I roll hour,

1329
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:18,180
I think he got it.

1330
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,120
Is that Canadian?

1331
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,060
When I was a bunch of you guys,

1332
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,641
I wasn't happy,

1333
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:20,821
you know,

1334
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:21,730
it's Kinda guy.

1335
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,321
I was like,

1336
00:33:22,321 --> 00:33:22,711
yeah,

1337
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,090
let's kick ass.

1338
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,430
You know everybody through
that crazy cart wheel kick.

1339
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,210
Yeah.

1340
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,110
On Steve Genom.

1341
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:28,890
Yeah.

1342
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,340
Yeah.

1343
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:29,930
That was a,

1344
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,780
that was a good fight,

1345
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,530
you know?

1346
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:31,951
Yeah.

1347
00:33:31,951 --> 00:33:32,910
It was good man.

1348
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,631
How about that box?

1349
00:33:33,631 --> 00:33:33,931
Sorry,

1350
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:34,321
Marissa.

1351
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:35,340
And with white gloves.

1352
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:36,781
Yeah.

1353
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,360
What was the Jimmerson Art Jimmerson.

1354
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,170
Yeah.

1355
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,430
What was that about me?

1356
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:40,740
Probably.

1357
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,300
Maybe he had a hurt hand or something.

1358
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:42,691
No,

1359
00:33:42,691 --> 00:33:45,150
I think he was thinking more
like he's going to grab it.

1360
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:46,200
Went in and swing with it.

1361
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:46,391
No,

1362
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:46,550
no,

1363
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,010
and I don't know guy who
knows to go to with Irvine,

1364
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,903
but it was awesome.

1365
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,230
It was that real thing.

1366
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,310
It was,

1367
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,380
it was that time were,

1368
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,250
I literally watched the fight back
in and then taught someone could die.

1369
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,410
[inaudible] needed to have so much
courage back in the day to step into the

1370
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,090
octagon much more than nowadays.

1371
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:05,961
Nowadays.

1372
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:06,131
You know,

1373
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,900
I can before it's no weight class,

1374
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,570
nothing.

1375
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,870
And who has known unknown.

1376
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,350
I remember I fight like a Norris,

1377
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,021
uh,

1378
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:18,830
against that Pat Smith
and that guy had that day.

1379
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,300
You know what?

1380
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:20,720
Like,

1381
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,210
like a blood everywhere before
they stopped that fight.

1382
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:27,020
They UCF a towel flying and he
still didn't stop that fight.

1383
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:27,854
I'm like the,

1384
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,720
this is a one time use.

1385
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,431
This is the,

1386
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:31,630
the guys that pioneer,

1387
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:31,881
you know,

1388
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:32,361
these guys,

1389
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,010
they were a real tough guy.

1390
00:34:34,011 --> 00:34:34,760
You know what I mean?

1391
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,001
Yeah.

1392
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:36,160
There was no referee stopping.

1393
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,411
Yeah,

1394
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:37,181
no referee,

1395
00:34:37,181 --> 00:34:37,641
you know,

1396
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:38,151
round.

1397
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:38,541
No.

1398
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,520
At Lake Commission and no awake glass.

1399
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:41,121
No with this.

1400
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:41,690
No Dad,

1401
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,523
no way.

1402
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,920
Lights were fights get stopped quickly.

1403
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:46,820
Does that Piss you off?

1404
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:48,520
Why didn't,

1405
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:48,830
you know,

1406
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:49,880
it's to protect the,

1407
00:34:49,881 --> 00:34:50,090
uh,

1408
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:50,450
you know,

1409
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,160
at the referee can make
a mistake sometime.

1410
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:53,200
And it pissed me off yet.

1411
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,400
Sad to see it when his a mistake done.

1412
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,261
I think they,

1413
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,100
they tried to be the best they could be.

1414
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,240
But like the,

1415
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,310
I believe the round,

1416
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,090
I don't,

1417
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,740
I don't think grown is good idea.

1418
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,540
That's my open year round.

1419
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,491
It's a good idea.

1420
00:35:07,491 --> 00:35:07,940
Yeah.

1421
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,900
What about gloves?

1422
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,260
Some people think there
should be no gloves.

1423
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,760
Some people think Nia guy
and elbow guy and kick a guy.

1424
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:18,680
Like why are they have
covers on your knuckles?

1425
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,520
That's true.

1426
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,900
It could be an option but no glove.

1427
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,220
But they would be a lot of broken him.

1428
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,270
But that probably they would
fight different migration.

1429
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:25,620
I,

1430
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,520
I wrote stuff that they
used to hit a lot with the,

1431
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,200
smashed it down,

1432
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:31,034
you know.

1433
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,021
Well if you,

1434
00:35:32,021 --> 00:35:32,660
you know,

1435
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,720
she wants the old boss
Rutan days and pancreas,

1436
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,520
he figured out that he could throw punches

1437
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:38,880
with,

1438
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,560
he pulls his hand way back.

1439
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,830
So instead of like slapping
and like karate chop style,

1440
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,340
he was throwing punches but
he was doing with his palm.

1441
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,850
Yeah.

1442
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,710
But the thing is we wouldn't
fight that same way.

1443
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:50,544
We would fight now,

1444
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,440
preserve our buddy like,

1445
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,270
and I like it when I fucked in the ass.

1446
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:54,640
I wasn't,

1447
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,890
it wasn't turtle Bush and I was
punching like if I were to be bare hand,

1448
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,110
I would hit with my palm.

1449
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,861
You know what I mean?

1450
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:03,420
I wouldn't get that same way.

1451
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:07,110
I would have probably be broke my
hand or I never had my hand broken.

1452
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:07,851
You know what I'm at.

1453
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:08,401
I'm lucky,

1454
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,180
you know,

1455
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,781
but uh,

1456
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:10,614
you know,

1457
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,070
different,

1458
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,670
different,

1459
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,181
different way.

1460
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:14,010
It would make it better also for the,

1461
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:18,930
all the grappling aspect of Brazilian
Jiu Jitsu and wrestling is I would be

1462
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:19,630
better.

1463
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,740
It would be more realistic.

1464
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:21,011
I mean,

1465
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:23,560
I don't really understand why
they have a pat on the gloves.

1466
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:23,921
I mean,

1467
00:36:23,921 --> 00:36:28,690
I think it's a 100% I don't know if you
don't have pads on your shins and your

1468
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:31,240
kicking people in the face like come on.

1469
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:31,990
That's crazy.

1470
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,210
Like you're going to pad
little knuckles and yeah,

1471
00:36:34,211 --> 00:36:35,200
you can cut people more,

1472
00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:36,460
but it also breaks your hand more.

1473
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:37,031
It's just,

1474
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:37,851
it's if you want to,

1475
00:36:37,851 --> 00:36:38,684
if this sport,

1476
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,960
if you're trying to have it be realistic,

1477
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,100
it's almost like bad to allow people to
wear gloves because it allows them to

1478
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:48,760
tee off and punches hard as
they can without worrying
about breaking their hands

1479
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:49,760
100%.

1480
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,361
100%.

1481
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:50,900
It's true.

1482
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:51,733
It's true.

1483
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,311
And I,

1484
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:52,700
you know,

1485
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,150
I,

1486
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,510
you know,

1487
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,710
you could break your hand,

1488
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:55,101
but you know,

1489
00:36:55,101 --> 00:36:58,100
when you hit that guy with a
good bunch on and their Dra,

1490
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:58,821
you know,

1491
00:36:58,821 --> 00:37:00,770
at bare knuckle I don't think
it will break your hand,

1492
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,633
you know,

1493
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,810
just doing karate,

1494
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:03,250
you know,

1495
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:03,761
Kevin cushion,

1496
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:03,931
they,

1497
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:04,251
they,

1498
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:04,830
you know,

1499
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,420
well people are also um,

1500
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,320
you know,

1501
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,310
punch much harder of course because
the tape and I don't think it's there.

1502
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,290
The Grad I think is that they,

1503
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,270
the holder risk.

1504
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,700
So there was no movement
than there is at everything.

1505
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:17,520
All the impact makes it
hard or is definitely,

1506
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:18,354
that's why I believe,

1507
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,261
yeah,

1508
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:21,750
I think the hand wrap definitely
aids the person who's punching.

1509
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:26,310
But you also would be really cognizant
of only punching with the first two

1510
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,144
knuckles,

1511
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:27,451
you know,

1512
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:28,440
cause in boxing,

1513
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,900
you know your toe,

1514
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,630
you taught to punch and concentrate
on those knuckles button.

1515
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:33,750
Real reality.

1516
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,580
A lot of times when you
throw in combinations,

1517
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:37,380
you're hitting them with
all parts of your hand.

1518
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,150
Whereas you're taught in karate,

1519
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:40,800
the idea of a punching,

1520
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,281
you know,

1521
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:43,440
like a mock Mara over
and over and over again.

1522
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:43,941
It's a tough,

1523
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:48,270
and these two knuckles Jack Dempsey says
is that third Nicole the third note.

1524
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,571
Yes.

1525
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,780
He was punished with that Turret Nakota
and it was no Starbucks cup power.

1526
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,261
Yeah,

1527
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:53,370
he could punch very hard.

1528
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:56,220
Just I'm so he says is that third I call
called because he said that I like him

1529
00:37:56,221 --> 00:37:58,200
enough that buddy is better
with at third knuckle.

1530
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:58,830
Hmm.

1531
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,663
That's interesting.

1532
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,220
So maybe I wouldn't never
argue with Jack Dempsey,

1533
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:05,730
but for most people believe that
it's the first time I can cut,

1534
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:05,940
right.

1535
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,900
The same thing they teach.

1536
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:10,920
But Jack Dempsey strangely says
the third Nicola in that book,

1537
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,170
he says that that guy
was a fucking savage,

1538
00:38:13,171 --> 00:38:13,800
Huh?

1539
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,101
Yeah.

1540
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:14,934
And he was like,

1541
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,130
watch those old old school fights and he
would find dude's much bigger than him.

1542
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:22,830
He was only at about a buck 90 and he
was like one 96 or something like that

1543
00:38:22,831 --> 00:38:24,720
when he was the heavyweight champion.

1544
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,060
He was fucking up those.

1545
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:27,601
You know what?

1546
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,351
I might be wrong.

1547
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:30,630
I think actually Jack Dempsey
was even lighter than that.

1548
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,070
I think Jack Dempsey,

1549
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:32,790
hold on a second.

1550
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:33,623
Let me pull it up.

1551
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,030
I don't even

1552
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,060
think he was 196 rocky Marciano,

1553
00:38:39,061 --> 00:38:40,050
which has really Sarah?

1554
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:40,260
No,

1555
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,760
was one 75 yeah.

1556
00:38:41,761 --> 00:38:42,960
What the fuck man?

1557
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,450
This certain dudes like that,

1558
00:38:45,451 --> 00:38:47,940
that chicks just can hit so fucking hard.

1559
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,431
Yeah,

1560
00:38:48,431 --> 00:38:49,040
but they're all,

1561
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,400
but it was not as big as well,

1562
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:51,860
you know.

1563
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,880
Now we're like months that
I looked at Klitschko,

1564
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:55,300
you know,

1565
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,811
it's crazy,

1566
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,240
you know?

1567
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,073
Yeah.

1568
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,370
It doesn't say his weight

1569
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,580
on his Wikipedia says is a,

1570
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,473
he was six foot,

1571
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,110
not sandal or Dempsey.

1572
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:05,220
It.

1573
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,490
Monsanto was like one seven
one one 75 one then one 80

1574
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:14,250
Marsianno was one 85

1575
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,050
mass general was,

1576
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,920
I remember I read it was a one 80 none.

1577
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:17,330
Nothing.

1578
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,230
I don't think he was.

1579
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:21,170
Dempsey was one 92 that's crazy.

1580
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah.

1581
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,450
It's like my size.

1582
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:26,390
It's my size fighting the every white
guy like Brock Lesnar over these shoots.

1583
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:27,581
But they do,

1584
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:29,940
they have those little
tiny ass gloves back then.

1585
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,390
True.

1586
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,070
They just a little,

1587
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,360
a little cover over the knuckles.

1588
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,390
Very little padding at all and it was
probably just like a little horse hair in

1589
00:39:36,391 --> 00:39:37,224
there as well.

1590
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,623
Mild.

1591
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,740
Wow.

1592
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,150
Do you pay attention to like a
old videos of like a old fights?

1593
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:50,290
Do you ever watch like a
old boxing matches and see
like what guys like Dempsey

1594
00:39:51,001 --> 00:39:51,641
had to go through?

1595
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:53,010
What guys like Jack Johnson had?

1596
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,210
I wish a lot of stuff,

1597
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:54,520
you know,

1598
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,950
like I what I've been
watching and the Internet,

1599
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,840
recent recent days,

1600
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,190
a lot of carry carry stuff everyday.

1601
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,280
I really intriguing.

1602
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:02,920
Really?

1603
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,390
Yeah,

1604
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,650
like dad at that point,

1605
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:05,490
get ready guys.

1606
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,470
It's very underrated.

1607
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,300
I get like a,

1608
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,051
a lot of good,

1609
00:40:10,051 --> 00:40:10,950
very good fighters.

1610
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:11,171
They,

1611
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:14,910
they come from that and I think it
translate to him and made her very well.

1612
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,270
Absolutely.

1613
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,030
And Marsha was one 88 apparently.

1614
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,780
Um,

1615
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,613
the,

1616
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:21,180
the,

1617
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,820
the ability to move in and out like
really quickly as my best ever fought.

1618
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,010
You fought in point tournaments before?

1619
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,400
I did,

1620
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:27,580
yeah.

1621
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,310
Very frustrated.

1622
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:29,680
I'm from Kyokushin karate.

1623
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,170
It's not that same seminar.

1624
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,600
I did point get ready before.

1625
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,010
Yeah.

1626
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,020
I find only a few point
karate tournaments,

1627
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:35,331
but uh,

1628
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:36,190
I found them,

1629
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:36,550
I'm,

1630
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,600
I fought some fault one really
high level guy and he was like,

1631
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,430
he wins a lot of those point tournaments.

1632
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:46,390
It was so different from taekwondo being
like continuous fighting to this being

1633
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:46,990
like stop,

1634
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,261
you know,

1635
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:47,940
it's like,

1636
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,800
and it was really hard to fight
that way if you're not used to it.

1637
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:54,700
And I would just imagine that the guy
who's really good at lunging in and out

1638
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:55,121
like that.

1639
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:55,360
Yeah.

1640
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,340
If you could teach them all
the other aspects of MMA,

1641
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:58,174
there'll be a big one.

1642
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,360
That's what I use for my,

1643
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:01,910
I take it out on the shoot that
people saw is your wrestling.

1644
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,310
It has nothing to do with my wrestling
and I was saying is that once I get that

1645
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:05,300
leg I finish that they go,

1646
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,360
but what I'll do,

1647
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,030
I get in and that was because of karate
before like no way guy right there,

1648
00:41:10,031 --> 00:41:10,400
you know,

1649
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,570
and scarcity.

1650
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,140
That allowed me to cut
the distance and take,

1651
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,110
take the people down.

1652
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,530
I have a very good single to the boat
or the very good Dubbo and a very good

1653
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:20,660
penetration is because of my leg.

1654
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:23,450
The way I do and this timing
I get is from the karate.

1655
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:24,763
Wow.

1656
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,210
It's I wrestling too,

1657
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:30,650
but karate primary because before I start
wrestling it was karate guy pure and

1658
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:31,060
I,

1659
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,370
I just,

1660
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,280
I he mates myself well to wrestling

1661
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,920
and wrestling for especially
for the mixed martial art.

1662
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,501
Why does,

1663
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:39,470
that's really interesting because
I've always said that one,

1664
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,040
you are the best things about you as
the your ability to close the distance.

1665
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:43,310
Yeah.

1666
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,000
It's got read to you.

1667
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,870
Does that make sense?

1668
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,620
Yeah,

1669
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,610
totally makes sense.

1670
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:46,881
Yeah.

1671
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:49,030
My footwork pattern and
everything is from karate.

1672
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:52,910
Is this what I get it from
springing in like that,

1673
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,151
you know,

1674
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,620
the ability to cover that distance,

1675
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:58,220
that's a huge advantage covered
in the sand and to not get hit.

1676
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,620
This is very important.

1677
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,513
Right?

1678
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,041
Yeah.

1679
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:04,490
And that is one of the
cornerstones of those tournament's.

1680
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,870
And that style,

1681
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:07,010
did you um,

1682
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,480
have a hard time when you made the
transition to more Thai and MMA style?

1683
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,550
It today,

1684
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:15,800
today even my kicks are
more like karate guy.

1685
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:16,100
You know,

1686
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:16,790
I don't,

1687
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,623
I do more tie,

1688
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,040
but I might kick,

1689
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:19,341
you know,

1690
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:20,870
it's like printed inside.

1691
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,540
It's hard to say like
you're a taekwondo guy,

1692
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,010
you'll can kick butt,

1693
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,300
you will stay taekwondo.

1694
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,193
Like,

1695
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:27,650
no,

1696
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,370
it's fine too.

1697
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:28,640
You know,

1698
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,810
it's the best.

1699
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:32,120
Like I believe it was the
best spending back at you.

1700
00:42:32,121 --> 00:42:34,670
You have the best spinning back
kick I ever seen in my entire life.

1701
00:42:34,671 --> 00:42:35,270
You know,

1702
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,250
they're from taekwondo,

1703
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:36,860
you know what I mean?

1704
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,460
Yeah.

1705
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:42,080
And is your background and you tried to
change your technique of your spending

1706
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:42,541
back keg,

1707
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:44,030
it will be the worst thing you could do.

1708
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,661
You know what I mean?

1709
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:47,500
So I tried to learn to
have stuff to Marzano,

1710
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,910
but I don't try to change my,

1711
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:49,551
my thing,

1712
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:49,750
you know,

1713
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,870
one.

1714
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:50,300
Right,

1715
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:50,960
right.

1716
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,320
Yeah,

1717
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,070
I um,

1718
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,950
I still incorporate a
lot of those techniques,

1719
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:59,951
but I do more just regular more time now
than anything else because I think all

1720
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,190
those techniques like the spinning back
kick and we'll kick for a guy like you

1721
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:07,880
that has like a strong karate background
or a guy who picks things up really

1722
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:08,391
quickly,

1723
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:08,900
that's,

1724
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,171
you know,

1725
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:09,261
those,

1726
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:10,790
those are good techniques to learn.

1727
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,240
But like for every day use,

1728
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,230
it's hard to pull those things off unless
you're doing it on a regular basis.

1729
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,950
Like they become normal when you're
fighting and Taco no tournaments and

1730
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:22,620
everybody's doing it,

1731
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,630
you're doing it every day.

1732
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,820
But in MMA there's so many
other fucking things like to,

1733
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,601
to have the,

1734
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:29,360
the type of leg dexterity that you see,

1735
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:31,370
like the top level talk when no guys have,

1736
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:36,610
it's be so hard to have that along
with wrestling along with boxing,

1737
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:38,570
along with Jujitsu,

1738
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,730
like how do you manage like
all your different skill sets?

1739
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,180
Do you have like a,

1740
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,670
like a 20% of your time goes to this?

1741
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:49,310
30% goes to that like no,

1742
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:49,591
no,

1743
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:49,790
no.

1744
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,750
It depends on the like fuck that.

1745
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,140
Like I'll give you an example right now.

1746
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:54,890
Um,

1747
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,810
last week I was doing for
the movie captain America,

1748
00:43:58,811 --> 00:43:59,570
that filming.

1749
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,070
Then now I'm doing the interview,

1750
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,800
but every day I find the
time I go to Freddy Roach,

1751
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,930
work on my boxing and this bird
of my like this time on my box,

1752
00:44:08,931 --> 00:44:09,764
same pretty much.

1753
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,260
And when I'm going to go
to New York for example,

1754
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:14,470
because I have to go to
New York for a Dobro,

1755
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,640
the book Promo and said
I'm going to do my digits,

1756
00:44:16,641 --> 00:44:17,400
would John Donne error,

1757
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,710
I'm going to be doing Jujitsu,

1758
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:19,160
Jujitsu.

1759
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,120
When I go back and my child,

1760
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:20,960
I mixed up everything,

1761
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:21,710
you know,

1762
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:23,060
but when I go to different places,

1763
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:23,600
I go,

1764
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,140
uh,

1765
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:24,680
you know,

1766
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,513
I do my,

1767
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:26,810
my like,

1768
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:27,170
uh,

1769
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,310
specific things.

1770
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,410
And this is in between fights,

1771
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:31,800
so you don't have to scheduled.

1772
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:32,520
So now

1773
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,130
you just in the skill
development phases it is.

1774
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:35,481
Yeah.

1775
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:37,640
And that's where my
training is fun because I,

1776
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:38,270
I,

1777
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:41,240
I trained for myself to
get better and I try stuff.

1778
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,420
I acknowledge you see me if
I go roller with my friend,

1779
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:45,290
like it is like heading me,

1780
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:45,741
I wrote,

1781
00:44:45,741 --> 00:44:47,930
I try stuff that I would
maybe not have the,

1782
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,960
the guts to try it normal
dying because it's risky.

1783
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:51,800
So,

1784
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,521
so I'd try it.

1785
00:44:52,521 --> 00:44:52,701
Oh,

1786
00:44:52,701 --> 00:44:53,540
I get that bad.

1787
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:53,811
You know,

1788
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:54,301
I ate that but,

1789
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:54,801
and I laugh,

1790
00:44:54,801 --> 00:44:55,660
who cares like that,

1791
00:44:55,661 --> 00:44:56,150
but I don't,

1792
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,440
I don't care her sometime at that pay,

1793
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,490
sometime I get that.

1794
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,210
Right.

1795
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,040
But when I trained for a training camp,

1796
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:01,911
no,

1797
00:45:01,911 --> 00:45:04,400
I traded for performance
so I have to perform.

1798
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,740
I cannot be beaten and trainee is always,

1799
00:45:06,741 --> 00:45:07,980
my confidence will be effect.

1800
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,560
So I tried to perform.

1801
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,200
So that's where my training
is not as fun as it is now.

1802
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,283
Right.

1803
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:13,911
Yeah.

1804
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:18,320
The ability to loosen up in training
is very important when you're in the

1805
00:45:18,321 --> 00:45:18,981
learning phase,

1806
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:19,250
right?

1807
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,030
Yes.

1808
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:21,470
That's how you develop new techniques.

1809
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:22,340
And there's,

1810
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:23,990
there is an ego issue too,

1811
00:45:23,991 --> 00:45:25,070
like with guys who,

1812
00:45:25,071 --> 00:45:25,400
uh,

1813
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,110
are not that good at Jujitsu.

1814
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,780
Like you see it a lot
like maybe like strikers,

1815
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,330
they don't want to roll because
they don't like getting tapped

1816
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,600
stupid as it,

1817
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,430
it doesn't mean anything.

1818
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:34,821
You tap,

1819
00:45:34,821 --> 00:45:36,520
it doesn't mean you're not
as good as the other guy.

1820
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:40,430
That's mean you play that game and
you just got to cut that none of it.

1821
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,301
So what you know,

1822
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:42,710
so when I got the tap all the time,

1823
00:45:42,711 --> 00:45:43,431
I don't give a damn.

1824
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:43,970
You know,

1825
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,950
it's a fascinating
aspect of Jujitsu though.

1826
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:47,690
That doesn't exist in other martial arts.

1827
00:45:47,691 --> 00:45:47,841
You know,

1828
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:49,850
like if he was kickbox and spar a guy,

1829
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:50,880
it's not as it,

1830
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:51,590
you know,

1831
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:52,030
it's like,

1832
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:52,231
yeah,

1833
00:45:52,231 --> 00:45:53,320
you don't want to be knocked out.

1834
00:45:53,321 --> 00:45:54,910
But I mean is it would be
that same thing in a way.

1835
00:45:54,911 --> 00:45:56,830
Let's say you,

1836
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,830
you're a Jujitsu guy and
you do kick by someone,

1837
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,081
that guy,

1838
00:45:59,081 --> 00:46:00,060
but that guy will not knock y'all.

1839
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:00,420
You will,

1840
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:00,670
it will.

1841
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,830
Let's say we'll do a combo
that he will be like,

1842
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:06,710
you will know and I owe that right hand
and would have knocked me out if you

1843
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:07,710
know it's something you're Jitsu.

1844
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:08,650
Oh I would tap,

1845
00:46:08,651 --> 00:46:08,951
I'd always,

1846
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:10,210
he would have break my arm.

1847
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:11,590
It's same thing.

1848
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:11,741
We,

1849
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:12,730
we don't hurt each other.

1850
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,860
You can allow it to go further without
hurting then and kickboxing for example

1851
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:20,190
where it's tracking it
can be brain damage.

1852
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:20,800
Yeah.

1853
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,350
That's the hardest is that,

1854
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,590
or I should ask you is that the hardest
place to find guys that are comfortable

1855
00:46:26,591 --> 00:46:28,030
with training with is in striking.

1856
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,490
So you know that they're
not trying to knock you out.

1857
00:46:30,491 --> 00:46:30,761
You know,

1858
00:46:30,761 --> 00:46:32,800
you like every day in the gym is in a war.

1859
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:33,980
Fred,

1860
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:38,400
the Ag and it too is I have many times
people try to hurt me and I tried to with

1861
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:38,810
her,

1862
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,141
you know,

1863
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:40,220
and I have no choice.

1864
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:41,054
You know,

1865
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:41,690
I've been,

1866
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:42,031
you know,

1867
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:42,890
and when I first,

1868
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:43,783
you know,

1869
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:44,240
no,

1870
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,350
it's different because of the nut RBT APP.

1871
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:49,850
I can find place how I can
go and I mean training,

1872
00:46:49,851 --> 00:46:50,601
it's training,

1873
00:46:50,601 --> 00:46:50,870
you know,

1874
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:51,830
we still go hard.

1875
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,230
There is a smart way to train.

1876
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:54,651
Of course,

1877
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:58,070
I don't try to hurt myself when I
train and tried to hurt the people,

1878
00:46:58,071 --> 00:46:58,904
you know.

1879
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,750
But of course I say I'm training for a
fight before a fight and we spar hard.

1880
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,860
If the guy you see,

1881
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:04,401
you heard the guy,

1882
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:05,270
you let them breed,

1883
00:47:05,271 --> 00:47:05,460
you know,

1884
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,530
don't go for the finish.

1885
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,310
But the thing is for example kicked today,

1886
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,560
who control that kicked today?

1887
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,391
Things like that,

1888
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:11,571
you know,

1889
00:47:11,571 --> 00:47:13,280
we don't do needs today.

1890
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,330
The hell Buddhist stuff like that.

1891
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,164
We don't do that.

1892
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,140
That and this is important.

1893
00:47:18,141 --> 00:47:19,340
I have a good training partner like that,

1894
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:20,060
you know,

1895
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,710
cause sometimes we turn it
with someone who was crazy.

1896
00:47:21,711 --> 00:47:22,241
He's gonna you're,

1897
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:23,600
you're getting ready for a fight.

1898
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:24,680
It's a lot of money on the table.

1899
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,940
He's going to cut.

1900
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:26,520
Yeah.

1901
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:30,140
Cut you or say like is things like that
you don't need you to make a name for

1902
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:30,860
himself.

1903
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,700
So now when I'm,

1904
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:32,841
people ask me,

1905
00:47:32,841 --> 00:47:32,991
hey,

1906
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:34,670
what are you going to go train in my gym?

1907
00:47:34,671 --> 00:47:36,240
And like this is because sometime I had,

1908
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,520
because I go train in the gym,

1909
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,560
they know who I am and
I'm George Saint Pierre.

1910
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:39,891
And they go,

1911
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:40,041
oh,

1912
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:41,960
I'm going to try to hurt him
to make a name for myself.

1913
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:42,860
And that sucks.

1914
00:47:42,861 --> 00:47:43,101
You know,

1915
00:47:43,101 --> 00:47:43,341
that's,

1916
00:47:43,341 --> 00:47:44,174
I don't like it.

1917
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:48,710
So that very careful with where I trained
now that's the bad side of it because

1918
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:50,360
they let other people
tried to take him out.

1919
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,290
They can make that name,

1920
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:52,070
you know,

1921
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:53,270
and I don't like it.

1922
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:53,490
You know,

1923
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:54,323
I'm,

1924
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,740
I like to try it with different
trade partner and you guys and,

1925
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,250
but now I have to be careful to do it.

1926
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:58,971
I cannot do it,

1927
00:47:58,971 --> 00:47:59,460
you know,

1928
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,000
I have to,

1929
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,410
you know,

1930
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,340
have to know where I'm going with Dell.

1931
00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:03,051
The guy tells me,

1932
00:48:03,051 --> 00:48:03,171
Oh,

1933
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,550
this guy kind of go with him.

1934
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:04,770
He's,

1935
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:05,241
he's good,

1936
00:48:05,241 --> 00:48:05,591
you know,

1937
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,210
and I don't care what that got
tapped out or it'd be dominated.

1938
00:48:08,211 --> 00:48:09,650
That's not what I care is care of,

1939
00:48:09,651 --> 00:48:10,670
being hurt,

1940
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:11,240
you know,

1941
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,730
or android and I'd be able to,

1942
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,793
to work,

1943
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:14,421
you know,

1944
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:16,540
it's a lot of money when I
have a fight after counseled.

1945
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:16,700
It's,

1946
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,310
sorry.

1947
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:17,431
Yeah,

1948
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:19,050
there's always accidental injuries,

1949
00:48:19,051 --> 00:48:20,130
but there's the injuries where,

1950
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:20,521
you know,

1951
00:48:20,521 --> 00:48:22,710
a guy's trying to hurt you
because he's trying to,

1952
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,180
that's gotta be really annoying.

1953
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:24,960
Wow.

1954
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,440
There was guys that I'll do you say they,

1955
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,000
they always hurt people.

1956
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:30,600
So,

1957
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:30,781
no,

1958
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:31,501
I didn't mean it,

1959
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:33,480
but like why it always happened to you,

1960
00:48:33,481 --> 00:48:33,840
man.

1961
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,171
Why?

1962
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:34,960
I always happen to,

1963
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,630
I've got it in the gym
and Marcelo is like,

1964
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,080
when I bring my training
partner air for Lex,

1965
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,640
I bring a guys to train,

1966
00:48:41,641 --> 00:48:42,270
uh,

1967
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:43,650
from like my last training camp,

1968
00:48:43,651 --> 00:48:44,640
bring guys to train,

1969
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:45,474
uh,

1970
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,440
for my training camp
to mimic an IG of the,

1971
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:49,140
as I told these guys,

1972
00:48:49,141 --> 00:48:49,611
I listened,

1973
00:48:49,611 --> 00:48:50,341
there was this guy,

1974
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:50,701
this guy,

1975
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:53,430
you're not going to train
with him because he's like,

1976
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,600
and they're all like,

1977
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,050
whoa.

1978
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:55,250
It,

1979
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:55,501
why,

1980
00:48:55,501 --> 00:48:55,681
why?

1981
00:48:55,681 --> 00:48:55,951
It's like,

1982
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:59,040
because when every time someone trained
with you is yapping on injuries,

1983
00:48:59,041 --> 00:48:59,101
I,

1984
00:48:59,101 --> 00:48:59,251
yeah,

1985
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:00,011
but I don't mean,

1986
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:00,471
and as I,

1987
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,230
you don't mean it,

1988
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,520
but it's still happening,

1989
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:02,821
man.

1990
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:03,740
There's like [inaudible],

1991
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,280
that's all you are a man.

1992
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,140
I've seen guys kicked out a gym for that,

1993
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:08,550
of cars of course.

1994
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:09,410
But some guys,

1995
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,320
it's intentional.

1996
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:10,621
So guy,

1997
00:49:10,621 --> 00:49:11,700
it's not intentional,

1998
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,250
but even if it's not intentional,

1999
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,150
you don't want to take
the chance to do with,

2000
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,050
you know what I mean?

2001
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:17,470
I don't want hurt people when we meet,

2002
00:49:17,471 --> 00:49:18,151
want to try and find me.

2003
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:19,320
I got that hour it and training.

2004
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:21,900
It could have happened accidentally
once and are very rare.

2005
00:49:21,901 --> 00:49:22,471
It's very rare.

2006
00:49:22,471 --> 00:49:23,101
I heard people,

2007
00:49:23,101 --> 00:49:23,430
you know,

2008
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:23,791
very,

2009
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:24,624
very rare.

2010
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:24,991
I couldn't,

2011
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,770
if I wanted to,

2012
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:26,580
I could,

2013
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,440
but I don't hear,

2014
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,350
I don't hurt.

2015
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,040
I don't want to hear it here.

2016
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,880
Heard the people,

2017
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:31,310
you know they're trained.

2018
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:31,861
Yes,

2019
00:49:31,861 --> 00:49:32,311
of course.

2020
00:49:32,311 --> 00:49:33,144
Of course.

2021
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:33,431
Yeah.

2022
00:49:33,431 --> 00:49:34,031
There's a,

2023
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:37,180
there's a couple guys I know that it's
just people who just won't train with

2024
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:37,530
this.

2025
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:38,363
He just,

2026
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:39,020
they're just

2027
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,680
walk away hurt because you know what,

2028
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:43,760
the minute you're going to turn with them,

2029
00:49:43,761 --> 00:49:44,630
it's going to be a fight.

2030
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:47,420
You know it's going to be like I really
fight and I and I'm and you know,

2031
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:47,810
I don't,

2032
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:51,680
I fight yet and I'm paid to fight and I
don't want to hurt myself in real life,

2033
00:49:51,681 --> 00:49:51,981
you know,

2034
00:49:51,981 --> 00:49:52,870
and I don't want to have to,

2035
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:55,100
to hurt so I don't want to
put myself in this situation.

2036
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,800
Great camp now though man you got,

2037
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,820
you're going to so many
different great guys.

2038
00:49:59,821 --> 00:50:00,181
John,

2039
00:50:00,181 --> 00:50:00,551
Donna,

2040
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:05,551
her who's one of the most underrated or
underappreciated Jiu Jitsu coaches in

2041
00:50:06,031 --> 00:50:07,470
MMA in the world.

2042
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:09,240
Really you know it with you.

2043
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:13,860
If you look at all the different guys
that get famous for coke and Jujitsu talks

2044
00:50:13,861 --> 00:50:16,170
a lot of people about John Donner
and they all said the same thing.

2045
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:17,940
Like that guy's a bad motherfucker.

2046
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,350
Super Smart,

2047
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,210
brilliant in the corner.

2048
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,070
Like I love the advice he gives.

2049
00:50:23,071 --> 00:50:24,900
He's always on point.

2050
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:25,650
Direct,

2051
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,483
accurate.

2052
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,600
I scribed the most,

2053
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:31,220
I would say legs,

2054
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,020
brilliant educated man I ever met in my,

2055
00:50:35,021 --> 00:50:35,580
in my life.

2056
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:35,690
You know,

2057
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:36,523
he's brilliant.

2058
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,290
That's a lot of people don't know.

2059
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,153
You know,

2060
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:40,930
I believe he was a philosophy major.

2061
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:41,450
Yeah,

2062
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:46,250
he is that he is a phd in philosophy.

2063
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,740
It used to teach philosophy
in Columbia University

2064
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:54,770
before you drop everything and
dedicated his life to shit.

2065
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,390
So when he was,

2066
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:56,940
I got night and that hip hop,

2067
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,793
oh my God,

2068
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:59,950
hip hop clubs,

2069
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:00,811
can you believe it?

2070
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:04,320
And apparently he was like big on like
weightlifting back then it was my buddy

2071
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,370
and then he starts doing Jujitsu
and fell in love with it.

2072
00:51:07,371 --> 00:51:09,600
See that's amazing.

2073
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,230
Yeah.

2074
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:13,020
So you go to him for you to
Jitsu and Henzel as well,

2075
00:51:13,021 --> 00:51:13,201
right?

2076
00:51:13,201 --> 00:51:14,530
You could go to hens Zos yes,

2077
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:15,420
I go through a it.

2078
00:51:15,421 --> 00:51:16,970
That's what a lot of gems.

2079
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,381
Yeah.

2080
00:51:17,381 --> 00:51:18,060
But I travel.

2081
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,460
It's a good thing because I have,

2082
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,650
it's places that no matter what,

2083
00:51:20,651 --> 00:51:22,580
like I come to la often
for business stuff,

2084
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,570
but when I come to la,

2085
00:51:23,571 --> 00:51:25,430
I have the place where I can train in La.

2086
00:51:25,431 --> 00:51:25,641
You know,

2087
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:27,770
I'm very happy I faced while
I can trade in New York.

2088
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:29,510
I go to New York a lot and,

2089
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:29,881
and,

2090
00:51:29,881 --> 00:51:31,100

2091
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:32,270
if hounds and Pat Pat,

2092
00:51:32,271 --> 00:51:32,930

2093
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,291
you know,

2094
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:33,460
and,

2095
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,030
and it's,

2096
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:34,691
it's important.

2097
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:34,910
And you know,

2098
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,100
sorry,

2099
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,510
I started going everywhere I go out,

2100
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:36,910
back,

2101
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:37,820
go home,

2102
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,630
where I'm,

2103
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:39,800
I can go with came there,

2104
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,430
get better.

2105
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,360
That was hilarious when you brought that
a French dude with you on the ultimate

2106
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:45,410
fighter and he showed up,

2107
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:45,801
hammered.

2108
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:46,640
What is his name again?

2109
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,410
Josh on Charlotte's got Buskey.

2110
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:48,801
Yeah,

2111
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,180
he's very good point.

2112
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:50,690
That guy,

2113
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:55,690
very famous Moitai a kickboxer and he
would be partying all night and show up to

2114
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:58,670
the gym with one of them club cups,

2115
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,520
plastic cups and it was
fucking alcohol in it.

2116
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,080
He's out of his mind.

2117
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:04,361
Shows up.

2118
00:52:04,361 --> 00:52:06,370
He was drunk and high from the party.

2119
00:52:06,371 --> 00:52:11,371
Like you haven't slept for more than like
36 hours and know that this flight to

2120
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:14,350
Paris then I thought I made the training.

2121
00:52:14,351 --> 00:52:16,430
When you arrive I made on purpose.

2122
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:16,690
I,

2123
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:20,560
I made arrogant as a training for him
to come teach the afternoon class,

2124
00:52:20,561 --> 00:52:21,341
the late afternoon,

2125
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:24,160
not that morning class because I say I
was thinking all he's going to sleep.

2126
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:24,731
No,

2127
00:52:24,731 --> 00:52:26,380
Yara from Paris the night before,

2128
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,890
went out all night wet and then
an after party went and uh,

2129
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:30,491
after,

2130
00:52:30,491 --> 00:52:31,211
after party.

2131
00:52:31,211 --> 00:52:32,920
And I arrived straight to training,

2132
00:52:32,921 --> 00:52:35,750
didn't even go to his
hotel room and training,

2133
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:36,730
kick everyone's ass.

2134
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,773
Boy.

2135
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,941
Everybody was like,

2136
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:40,050
what the hell is

2137
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:40,963
this?

2138
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,380
And even when they,

2139
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:42,921
when he left,

2140
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:46,130
because he stayed for like a week
when he left the producer of the,

2141
00:52:46,131 --> 00:52:47,370
of the ultimate fighter,

2142
00:52:47,371 --> 00:52:48,204
he came to see me,

2143
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:48,911
George,

2144
00:52:48,911 --> 00:52:49,121
George,

2145
00:52:49,121 --> 00:52:49,510
George,

2146
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,470
we need to get this guy.

2147
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,750
We need to keep this guy here.

2148
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:52,530
Oh,

2149
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:53,520
that's good TV.

2150
00:52:53,521 --> 00:52:53,791
You know?

2151
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:54,241
I was like,

2152
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:54,541

2153
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:55,060
no,

2154
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,050
he's leaving.

2155
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:56,380
Yes.

2156
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,001
To go back.

2157
00:52:57,001 --> 00:52:58,440
It was making me look bad.

2158
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,860
No know.

2159
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:01,743
It was like,

2160
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,750
it was like giving,

2161
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,600
I know,

2162
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,440
and he's not an imposing
looking guy was amazing.

2163
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,371
When you look at him,

2164
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:08,930
he's not like a scary looking,

2165
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,540
but he doesn't

2166
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,530
know anything about them.

2167
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:10,750
Memory.

2168
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:11,161
That's the thing.

2169
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:12,070
He has no idea.

2170
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:12,960
It was chocolate.

2171
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:13,940
There was under,

2172
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,940
you had no idea.

2173
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,580
You came in the room and
he sold those pictures.

2174
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:16,710
Like,

2175
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,790
who's these guys are,

2176
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:18,010
you know,

2177
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:18,211
like,

2178
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:18,451
you know,

2179
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:19,370
it was all of those like

2180
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,630
famous Muay Thai guy,

2181
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,400
but mom doesn't know anything about it.

2182
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,941
Yeah.

2183
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:24,560
He fights Tai's like yes,

2184
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,670
he fights in lumpiness stadium

2185
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,040
and if I black out again,

2186
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,040
he slides,

2187
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,260
it could work out with the
spinning elbow in their head.

2188
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:31,830
Then you know,

2189
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,790
like he does not fight.

2190
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:35,070
But you took that fight on
their short notice like,

2191
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:36,300
like a few days notice.

2192
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:37,400
And he was underweight.

2193
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,280
It was the ad to gain weight for the,

2194
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,010
there were the way class right away glass.

2195
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:43,020
He doesn't care.

2196
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:43,853
He has like,

2197
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:45,630
he has like courage like crazy.

2198
00:53:45,870 --> 00:53:46,703
Wow.

2199
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,790
It's weird cause you look at the
guy you would never think that guy,

2200
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:49,540
that fighter.

2201
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:50,373
It's amazing.

2202
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:52,330
Like all right,

2203
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:52,920
sorry.

2204
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,000
We're surround by a lot of character
and the boxing is much more famous in

2205
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,650
Europe than it is in America.

2206
00:53:58,651 --> 00:53:59,401
Isn't that true?

2207
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:02,310
I believe the level is higher in Europe.

2208
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,300
Yeah.

2209
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,100
Apparently the glory though,

2210
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:06,990
they're going to start to
bring glory to someone.

2211
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:07,883
Um,

2212
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,510
I think they're going to bring it to see,

2213
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,540
frank shamrock said they're
going to bring it to CBS sports.

2214
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,261
Uh,

2215
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:14,610
I dunno what channel that is,

2216
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:15,360
you know,

2217
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:15,691
which,

2218
00:54:15,691 --> 00:54:15,931
which,

2219
00:54:15,931 --> 00:54:16,111
you know,

2220
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:18,990
I know I think cvs has like a bunch
of different channels that they own,

2221
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,560
but if they start Aaron,

2222
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,840
those like high level,

2223
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:26,640
you know like a gold con Saki and Daniel
Geeta and all these like high level

2224
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:29,430
heavyweight guys got
some wild shit to watch.

2225
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,000
It's true.

2226
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:30,361
It's true.

2227
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:30,441
It,

2228
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:31,600
it's a,

2229
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:32,700
it's gotta to be interesting,

2230
00:54:32,701 --> 00:54:32,980
you know,

2231
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,820
bringing that to here.

2232
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:34,951
Yeah.

2233
00:54:34,951 --> 00:54:39,951
It's so funny how like the difference in
just like a pure straight up kickboxing

2234
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:41,191
match,

2235
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:41,461
you know,

2236
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:44,070
when guys have no worries
about being taken down,

2237
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:45,030
you know,

2238
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,990
and when people say,

2239
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:50,310
oh like the level of kickboxing and MMA
is not as high as the level of kickbox

2240
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,580
different distance.

2241
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:52,060
Yeah.

2242
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,260
Every friend you cannot
compare different stance.

2243
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:56,210
I list over,

2244
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,820
we didn't get knocked out by a,

2245
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:00,600
the Tonio big footsteps of a daze.

2246
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:01,960
I K one champion.

2247
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:03,950
You've got it guys.

2248
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,080
It's not the same thing.

2249
00:55:05,081 --> 00:55:06,400
It's not that same thing.

2250
00:55:06,730 --> 00:55:10,900
I mean it's easy to adapt when you are
at a higher level k one guy to adapt to

2251
00:55:10,901 --> 00:55:11,800
MMA timing.

2252
00:55:11,801 --> 00:55:12,101
But there's,

2253
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:13,090
the timing is different.

2254
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,420
I think Allister had some
issues going and stuff like,

2255
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,201
cause they could be too,

2256
00:55:17,201 --> 00:55:17,381
like,

2257
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:18,580
I don't know the inside of it,

2258
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:19,414
but I've just,

2259
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,930
it's got a testosterone issue.

2260
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:21,590
Ah,

2261
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,400
it's got low testosterone because yeah,

2262
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:23,991
he,

2263
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:24,291
you know,

2264
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:24,740
he'd,

2265
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,420
he tested high for testosterone.

2266
00:55:26,421 --> 00:55:27,500
Like he had taken something.

2267
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:27,850
Okay.

2268
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:29,330
Now he has low testosterone.

2269
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,840
Okay.

2270
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,031
That,

2271
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:30,580
I mean,

2272
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:30,860
like,

2273
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:31,810
it's just an,

2274
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:32,561
like an example,

2275
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:32,891
I don't know,

2276
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:35,850
dad they'd behind behind goes or what look

2277
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:36,091
like.

2278
00:55:36,091 --> 00:55:39,870
He had a lot of energy and big foot
Silva waited until he got tired and just

2279
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:40,770
beat the shit out of them.

2280
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,010
That was a,

2281
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:44,520
that was a brutal knockout too.

2282
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:45,301
I remember,

2283
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:46,440
I was surprised to see that.

2284
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:46,831
I was like,

2285
00:55:46,831 --> 00:55:47,431
oh my God,

2286
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:49,230
I was not expecting this big foot.

2287
00:55:49,231 --> 00:55:50,160
Silver looked awesome.

2288
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,600
That was an amazing combination,

2289
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:51,840
man.

2290
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,530
I mean,

2291
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:52,831
you know,

2292
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,650
whether,

2293
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,483
uh,

2294
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:56,130
Alster was hurt or not,

2295
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:59,160
the combination he leveled
them with was devastating.

2296
00:55:59,520 --> 00:55:59,881
You know,

2297
00:55:59,881 --> 00:56:00,151
just,

2298
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:00,331
I mean,

2299
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:00,780
he was key.

2300
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,613
It was like,

2301
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,400
it was a lot like,

2302
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,800
like remember Phil Baroni and Dave Manet,

2303
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,340
remember that knockout or Phil Baroni
had David [inaudible] up against the cage

2304
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,733
that was violent.

2305
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,280
It was not quite as like,

2306
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:12,660
oh,

2307
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,900
he hit him like four times
before Monet can even drop.

2308
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:16,591
That was bad.

2309
00:56:16,591 --> 00:56:16,860
Yeah.

2310
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,250
And baroni could fucking hit
and the just teeing off on him.

2311
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,920
It literally is keeping them
standing with his punches.

2312
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,100
This big foot one wasn't
quite as devastating as that,

2313
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,023
but it was number.

2314
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:27,190
Yeah,

2315
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:27,401
man.

2316
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:28,390
It was like bouncing on.

2317
00:56:28,391 --> 00:56:30,130
They felt like bang,

2318
00:56:30,131 --> 00:56:30,551
Bang,

2319
00:56:30,551 --> 00:56:31,001
Bang,

2320
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:31,391
Bang,

2321
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,224
Bang.

2322
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,040
It was like the greatest punching,

2323
00:56:34,070 --> 00:56:36,830
not highlight reel knockout
ever that brony Manet fights.

2324
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:37,400
It's true.

2325
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,120
It was bad.

2326
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,220
It was bad at some of the
those knock out of your Washer,

2327
00:56:40,221 --> 00:56:40,460
like,

2328
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,300
Ooh.

2329
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:42,650
Yeah.

2330
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:43,100
When,

2331
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,550
um,

2332
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,060
when you first lost your
title to Matt Serra,

2333
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,780
there was the first time that Matt,

2334
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:48,970
Matt,

2335
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:49,803
Matt,

2336
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:50,321
Matt said,

2337
00:56:50,321 --> 00:56:50,480
right.

2338
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,571
Yeah,

2339
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:50,871
it's true.

2340
00:56:50,871 --> 00:56:51,440
It's true.

2341
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,990
When you lost your title
Matt Serra and you know,

2342
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:55,400
and maths or a stop to,

2343
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,210
you know,

2344
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,043
that was,

2345
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,490
was that like,

2346
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:02,060
that had to be like the most
devastating loss of your career,

2347
00:57:02,061 --> 00:57:02,241
right?

2348
00:57:02,241 --> 00:57:02,481
It was,

2349
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:06,920
but I learned something vulnerable that
allowed me to survive to Carlos condit.

2350
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,193
What was that?

2351
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:10,460
When I get hit by Matt Serra,

2352
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:11,660
the First Punch,

2353
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:12,250
he,

2354
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:12,690
he,

2355
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:13,540
he uh,

2356
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:18,040
I make me very dizzy and
I was so proud that pride,

2357
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,090
it's a good thing,

2358
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,080
but it could be a bad thing.

2359
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,700
I was so proud.

2360
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:21,840
I'm,

2361
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,631
I'm a very proper,

2362
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:22,800
so,

2363
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,410
so I got,

2364
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:24,150
I got,

2365
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,660
uh,

2366
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,180
when we're both just say
an English Womble I got,

2367
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,370
I got Wabo and instead
of back off and say,

2368
00:57:30,371 --> 00:57:30,670
Oh,

2369
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,260
I'm going to go back to my sense,

2370
00:57:32,261 --> 00:57:32,470
wait,

2371
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:32,681
wait,

2372
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:32,801
that,

2373
00:57:32,801 --> 00:57:35,220
I go back to my Calibra
before we attacking,

2374
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,450
I got Webo and I got so angry.

2375
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:38,140
I was like,

2376
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,860
I can't believe this guy because back
in the day it was like five to one,

2377
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:42,521
10 to one,

2378
00:57:42,521 --> 00:57:43,420
the odds,

2379
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,080
I was like,

2380
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,110
I can't believe I get
wobble by a guy like this.

2381
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:48,130
And I looked like back in the day.

2382
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,030
Like I was saying,

2383
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,860
I was angry that I got wobble.

2384
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:53,380
I was proud gay first time
I ever happened in my life,

2385
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,830
so I want it to give it back
to him as fast as I can,

2386
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,740
but that's already hit
very hard was I was,

2387
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:01,180
I didn't have any caliber them.

2388
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,530
I got a website with one shot.

2389
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:07,531
Then I tried to jump back into a war with
him into a slug fest with him while I

2390
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,480
was wobbled annual hasn't,

2391
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,590
so I got punched,

2392
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:12,281
I boom,

2393
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:12,821
boom,

2394
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:13,210
boom.

2395
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:16,370
Then he started the tee off on me and
then I fall down and I had thought about

2396
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:16,450
it.

2397
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:17,530
I know it was completely,

2398
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:18,790
I would,

2399
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,541
I,

2400
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:21,370
if I would have to keep
going I would be like,

2401
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:22,060
you know I,

2402
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:22,361
you know,

2403
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:23,770
I just stop and things.

2404
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:23,971
God,

2405
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:24,804
the referee stopped.

2406
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,030
But what happened with Carlos
condit the same situation.

2407
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,820
I got kicked in the head then.

2408
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,270
Then instead of telling,

2409
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,510
oh I need to give it back to him,

2410
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,570
I followed him around.

2411
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:35,951
I said,

2412
00:58:35,951 --> 00:58:36,401
you know what?

2413
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:36,731
Yes,

2414
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:37,564
I got caught.

2415
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,010
Then relax.

2416
00:58:39,011 --> 00:58:40,690
Now it's time to re defense,

2417
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,670
catch up your bread,

2418
00:58:41,671 --> 00:58:42,011
catch up,

2419
00:58:42,011 --> 00:58:43,090
your your senses,

2420
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:43,451
Bang,

2421
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:43,751
Bang,

2422
00:58:43,751 --> 00:58:44,350
Bang.

2423
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,580
I focused on my defense,

2424
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:46,810
my shield grows,

2425
00:58:46,811 --> 00:58:47,351
everything,

2426
00:58:47,351 --> 00:58:49,360
every opportunity as to hurt me.

2427
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,040
And then I came back after,

2428
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,480
so I step into my,

2429
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:53,343
my uh,

2430
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,520
my ego a little bit,

2431
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:55,930
tried to accept the fight.

2432
00:58:55,931 --> 00:58:56,764
I got hit,

2433
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:57,580
relax,

2434
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:58,690
and then I came back later.

2435
00:58:58,691 --> 00:58:59,501
That's a little bit of it.

2436
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:03,130
That's the experience that I gained from
that loss with Matt Serra that allowed

2437
00:59:03,131 --> 00:59:04,090
me to survive.

2438
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,080
Carlos condit.

2439
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:06,663
Interesting.

2440
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,040
Because Carlos Condit
we dropped me with that,

2441
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:09,581
that,

2442
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:10,414
that kick.

2443
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:11,230
I,

2444
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:12,310
the first time he cut me,

2445
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,121
I want bold,

2446
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:14,530
but I didn't drop like I was,

2447
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:15,400
I was on my feet,

2448
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,110
but I tried to get back right into a
slug fest with him instead of backing up,

2449
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,300
tried to use my work,

2450
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:22,730
get back to my senses.

2451
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,080
And that's what happened.

2452
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:24,490
I got,

2453
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:24,741
got the,

2454
00:59:24,741 --> 00:59:24,891
you know,

2455
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:28,610
sometimes you learn during your
loss and that's what happened to me.

2456
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:30,290
Matt Serra by beating me,

2457
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:32,090
he helped me become a
better martial artist.

2458
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:32,860
You know

2459
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:33,693
the uh,

2460
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,610
the what,

2461
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:36,140
what had you in more trouble?

2462
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:37,010
The Punch by Matt,

2463
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:38,500
Sarah or the kickbox condoms.

2464
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:42,570
My Dad did kick I believe
with condit was like harder,

2465
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:44,010
was a bigger kick.

2466
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,280
The first punish if you look punches of
Sarah finished me because it was many

2467
00:59:48,281 --> 00:59:53,281
punches and that I took many punch before
I fall in a and when I fall I was too

2468
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:53,881
late.

2469
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:54,760
I was completely the,

2470
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:55,001
the,

2471
00:59:55,001 --> 00:59:56,350
the these at the DC,

2472
00:59:56,351 --> 00:59:56,920
you know,

2473
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:57,290
but,

2474
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:57,770
but I,

2475
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:58,630
I should have,

2476
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:00,530
when I got bunched and wobble because,

2477
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:00,971
and that's already,

2478
01:00:00,971 --> 01:00:03,280
he had very hub and I never
seen that much coming.

2479
01:00:03,281 --> 01:00:06,010
I should have stepped back
and or old him or go for it,

2480
01:00:06,011 --> 01:00:06,380
you know,

2481
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:10,450
instead of trying to slug fest with
him and gone condit when I got,

2482
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,313
I got dropped,

2483
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:12,751
I said to him,

2484
01:00:12,751 --> 01:00:13,111
I says,

2485
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:13,211
how,

2486
01:00:13,211 --> 01:00:13,690
okay,

2487
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:14,950
like don't go back until,

2488
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,070
because I couldn't go back and try to
go a single or go back up right away.

2489
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:18,251
I said,

2490
01:00:18,251 --> 01:00:18,491
okay,

2491
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:19,490
use the guard off,

2492
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,610
pop up close and close everything and,

2493
01:00:21,611 --> 01:00:22,900
and you know the,

2494
01:00:22,901 --> 01:00:24,650
because I was dizzy a
little bit to come there.

2495
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:25,000
You know,

2496
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,440
I didn't see that coming at all.

2497
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:29,920
I follow his buddy and his kid come
on their side and on the temple.

2498
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:30,720
He Bro,

2499
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:30,830
he,

2500
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,740
he damaged my uh,

2501
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:35,050
temple artery by the way.

2502
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,310
It was a hard kick man.

2503
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:36,720
Yeah,

2504
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:37,430
it looked like a hard,

2505
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:39,440
that's what do I spit all
after and I get it fixed.

2506
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:39,680
You know,

2507
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,100
you have to go in 10 minutes.

2508
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,260
What's going on here?

2509
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,210
Is that why you guys were
having a fucking conversation?

2510
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,110
What,

2511
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,220
what is it that's going on?

2512
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:48,011
You know,

2513
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,120
have another interview man.

2514
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:49,990
What kind of other interview?

2515
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,160
You've got some boring ass
bullshit is what you got.

2516
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:53,660
What do you got to do a,

2517
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,400
it's either a prs stuff for the book,

2518
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:55,900
I guess.

2519
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:56,391
Ah,

2520
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:58,010
the book PR stuff.

2521
01:00:58,310 --> 01:00:58,760
Um,

2522
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,020
so everybody wants,

2523
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,580
and I need to go train to joy.

2524
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:01,851
Yeah.

2525
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:03,420
Where are you going to trend
tonight at Freddie Roach?

2526
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:04,041
Tell anybody,

2527
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:04,340
man,

2528
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:05,360
I'm going to go watch it.

2529
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:08,750
I'd have this security
that the nerves do you,

2530
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:09,584
um,

2531
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,290
like now that you,

2532
01:01:11,291 --> 01:01:11,511
you,

2533
01:01:11,511 --> 01:01:12,950
you just beat Diaz.

2534
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,950
There's a lot of people that are coming
up in the hundred 70 pound division.

2535
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:17,570
Of course Johnny Hendricks is the,

2536
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:20,690
the big name and Jake Ellenberger
and all these different guys.

2537
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:25,930
Do you at one point in time
there's been a lot of talk,

2538
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:26,630
uh,

2539
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:31,490
at one point in time of you guys getting
together and you and Anderson Silva

2540
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,150
meeting maybe at a catch
weight or something like
that and fighting in a suit.

2541
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:36,103
A super superfly

2542
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:36,330
yeah.

2543
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:37,910
Is that question everybody asks me.

2544
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,430
They asked me that even before
I came back from my injury.

2545
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:41,050
You know,

2546
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,540
they want me like I need to do
stuff at my division before.

2547
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:45,560
I think because it's new,

2548
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:46,770
it has moved now,

2549
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:48,450
so I don't,

2550
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:50,400
I know somebody is fighting a quiz.

2551
01:01:50,401 --> 01:01:50,661
Wait,

2552
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:51,290
white men,

2553
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:52,730
but not nursing stuff is very big.

2554
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:53,031
You know,

2555
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:55,550
he's a one is two 30 pounds,

2556
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:55,941
you know,

2557
01:01:55,941 --> 01:01:57,200
it's very big guy walking around.

2558
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,300
You're big and I'm one 90 pounds.

2559
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,170
Right.

2560
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:02,200
And if he's a lot of way different.

2561
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:03,401
So it,

2562
01:02:03,401 --> 01:02:03,800
you know,

2563
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,880
if this fight that happened and one day
we're gonna have to decide what weight

2564
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:10,370
class and you know everything but this is,

2565
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:10,970
you know,

2566
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:14,170
and I tried to see figure out
what's going to happen and what the,

2567
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,570
wait could I send everything he says
he can make one 70 back if you want.

2568
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:18,530
Maximum one seven yeah.

2569
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:20,730
Wait one and you come
once in a knee is fine.

2570
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:21,810
Do you think that's possible?

2571
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:27,180
He was fighting back in the day in Japan
at one 68 that was a long time ago.

2572
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:27,721
But he was,

2573
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:29,490
he was over 25 years old.

2574
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:30,620
Wow.

2575
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,453
So you think he,

2576
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:34,280
if he just did it slowly over a long time?

2577
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,123
Yeah.

2578
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:41,490
You've ever seen the biggest weight cut
I did or anybody that you've ever seen

2579
01:02:41,681 --> 01:02:42,220
anybody do?

2580
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,660
I don't do much bay.

2581
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,421
A lot of car.

2582
01:02:44,421 --> 01:02:48,340
It would be easier for me to go fight
at one 55 then finding one 85 I would be

2583
01:02:48,341 --> 01:02:50,500
more at my weight actually,

2584
01:02:50,501 --> 01:02:51,030
that I,

2585
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:51,863
the one for,

2586
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:54,790
there's guy won 55 they
walk around one 90 like me.

2587
01:02:54,791 --> 01:02:55,080
Yes.

2588
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:55,590
I've seen them.

2589
01:02:55,590 --> 01:02:55,900
Yeah,

2590
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,540
because they think I'm big
because I have a large frame,

2591
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,590
but I don't want to have a,

2592
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,380
another big guy at very,

2593
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,100
I'm not tick tick,

2594
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,493
but eh,

2595
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:05,700
you know,

2596
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:05,920
I,

2597
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,753
uh,

2598
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:08,050
we'll see the site.

2599
01:03:08,051 --> 01:03:11,500
Like I know why he's fighting and
women and like Andrix is freaking out.

2600
01:03:11,501 --> 01:03:12,470
He wanted to fight me a little,

2601
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:13,030
you know,

2602
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:13,541
we'll see.

2603
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:13,780
You know,

2604
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:14,920
what's going to happen in the future?

2605
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:15,850
What do you think is next?

2606
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:20,500
Is it going to be the Hendricks fight
that's not going be car Andrix you know,

2607
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,053
that's a big fine.

2608
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:22,661
Yeah.

2609
01:03:22,661 --> 01:03:27,550
But the thing is every like is always
going to be a guy that people say,

2610
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:27,731
oh,

2611
01:03:27,731 --> 01:03:29,080
this guy got that beat you,

2612
01:03:29,081 --> 01:03:31,570
it's after Rick Warren and
who knows what's gonna happen.

2613
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:32,511
Yeah,

2614
01:03:32,511 --> 01:03:32,691
no,

2615
01:03:32,691 --> 01:03:33,020
it's good.

2616
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:33,380
Fine.

2617
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:33,981
It's a,

2618
01:03:33,981 --> 01:03:35,750
it's a fight that a lot
of people want to see you.

2619
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:37,970
You have a very talent stack division,

2620
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:38,361
you know,

2621
01:03:38,361 --> 01:03:42,290
you at the top and look at how many
a great contenders are at one 70

2622
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:42,941
yeah,

2623
01:03:42,941 --> 01:03:43,091
no,

2624
01:03:43,091 --> 01:03:43,270
no.

2625
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:44,530
It said it's a tough,

2626
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,870
it's a very tough division though.

2627
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:48,690
What's it like walking around
with that kind of stress?

2628
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,990
I mean you got like a whole line of
trained killers that want to get to the

2629
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:52,740
champ,

2630
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:52,981
you know,

2631
01:03:52,981 --> 01:03:54,990
is that a difficult thing to manage

2632
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:55,831
and that's stress.

2633
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:57,630
I tried to take one fight at a time,

2634
01:03:57,631 --> 01:03:58,410
you know,

2635
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:01,140
and a focus on the one
guy that I have no choice.

2636
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:02,610
I cannot split myself enough,

2637
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,473
you know?

2638
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:08,540
And for me that has to fight where close
to each other and my second fight that

2639
01:04:08,541 --> 01:04:08,931
training can,

2640
01:04:08,931 --> 01:04:09,960
and it was brutal,

2641
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:12,870
like in no way that I
didn't have mental break.

2642
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,000
Now I needed to take a little break,

2643
01:04:15,001 --> 01:04:18,320
meant it to come back stronger
after because I always thought,

2644
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,190
well I will get third what I do,

2645
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,840
I will not be as good as I could.

2646
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:23,351
I could be,

2647
01:04:23,351 --> 01:04:24,120
you know,

2648
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:25,260
but you still train,

2649
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,094
you still constantly.

2650
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,240
But I trained for fun.

2651
01:04:27,241 --> 01:04:28,290
I don't try to for performance,

2652
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:29,011
which is different.

2653
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:30,030
Like I explained earlier,

2654
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,370
I trade for myself and having a good time.

2655
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:33,204
It's fun.

2656
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,230
Now while you're doing this,

2657
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:37,110
do you keep up with the Jujitsu at
all or do you just do your boxing?

2658
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:37,561
None of them.

2659
01:04:37,561 --> 01:04:38,450
I do Jujitsu too.

2660
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:41,270
I like how many hours a day do you train?

2661
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:42,870
I depend.

2662
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:45,480
Like now I'm going to have
only maybe one hour and a half.

2663
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,390
I'm going to try not Freddie and,

2664
01:04:47,391 --> 01:04:48,141
and that's it.

2665
01:04:48,141 --> 01:04:48,780
And then I,

2666
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:49,020
you know,

2667
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,050
it depend my schedule number.

2668
01:04:50,051 --> 01:04:50,151
Yeah.

2669
01:04:50,151 --> 01:04:51,300
I train twice a week,

2670
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:51,520
twice,

2671
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,353
twice a day,

2672
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:53,663
uh,

2673
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:55,581
to treat,

2674
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:58,980
treat three hour maybe total like
two training of an hour and a half.

2675
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,110
The training itself is maybe 40,

2676
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:02,760
45 minutes for 30 minutes.

2677
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:03,960
The training itself,

2678
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:05,600
but that talking that this,

2679
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:08,850
the dad that changing that
shout down and hour and a half,

2680
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:09,610
um,

2681
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:10,181
now when you,

2682
01:05:10,181 --> 01:05:11,500
are you still doing gymnastics?

2683
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:11,801
Yes,

2684
01:05:11,801 --> 01:05:12,240
I do.

2685
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:12,560
How am I,

2686
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,393
how often do you do that?

2687
01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:14,171
Once,

2688
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:14,910
twice a week now.

2689
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:16,900
And you think that's like
a really responsible,

2690
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:18,100
a lot

2691
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,650
of like,

2692
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:19,483
uh,

2693
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:21,430
any track and field?

2694
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,293
I did check it.

2695
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,041
I run the check,

2696
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:28,041
had a track door like sprints and jumps
and 60 60 hundreds and four hundreds and

2697
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:29,800
um,

2698
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,180
you feel like that's the best kind of
a exercise for frame and may if I would

2699
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,570
have to start all over at GAM because
back in the day used to train like an

2700
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:37,840
idiot.

2701
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:42,300
I was doing buddy bolder and watching
movies like you know rocky and all this,

2702
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:42,660
you know.

2703
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,010
Oh and Jacco van Damme aren't all,

2704
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:50,110
I thought that was the thing back
in the 90s for my generation.

2705
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:54,850
That was the thing back in the day where
I'm from Canada and mix of martial art

2706
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,870
and buddy building was the best mix of
it would be you would your like you say a

2707
01:05:58,871 --> 01:05:59,411
bad ass,

2708
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:03,030
you know what you say that then in
the after we discovered at butterball,

2709
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:04,530
dirt is not suited for,

2710
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,021
you know,

2711
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:05,591
it makes my trade,

2712
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:10,591
it's better like do like I was doing
more like a strength conditioning kind of

2713
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:11,040
stuff,

2714
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,380
but then I found out after that strength
conditioning it was bitter and on a

2715
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:15,400
picnic thing I think is better.

2716
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:16,234
Does gymnastics.

2717
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:19,060
I think I tried a few joints as well.

2718
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:19,510
Yes,

2719
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:20,740
track and field and gymnastics.

2720
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:21,960
If I wouldn't have to do it,

2721
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:23,200
that's how I would George.

2722
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:24,880
That's how I would have
to go back in time.

2723
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:26,620
I would have to tell myself that George,

2724
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,710
stop all that bloody building
stuff that you're doing.

2725
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:31,370
It's better to do gymnastic.

2726
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:31,670
Yeah,

2727
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,260
and a track and field.

2728
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:37,190
Is that because you were already a
fairly physically strong guy and you're

2729
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:39,680
pretty strong from a wrestling as well,

2730
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:43,620
but if I'm very strong when I arrest,

2731
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:43,901
oh,

2732
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:44,270
when I,

2733
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:44,470
when?

2734
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,670
When I grabbed someone,

2735
01:06:46,090 --> 01:06:47,710
I can that strength,

2736
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:47,941
but they,

2737
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:48,731
if I lift weights,

2738
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:49,630
I'm not very strong.

2739
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,220
I benched like wet to play,

2740
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,690
to play the NAF maximum.

2741
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,150
I'll have very strong bench press before.

2742
01:06:55,151 --> 01:06:55,691
Like my God,

2743
01:06:55,691 --> 01:06:56,441
you're not very strongly.

2744
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:57,274
I gave,

2745
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,810
I'm not strong at lifting weight.

2746
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,510
When I was at,

2747
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:01,630
when I was a kid,

2748
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:06,631
I remember I was in school in
secondary school and everybody,

2749
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:08,560
the thing was to have a big chest,

2750
01:07:08,561 --> 01:07:08,801
you know,

2751
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:09,341
every guy.

2752
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:10,540
I wanted to have a big chess.

2753
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,660
So I remember for years
I used to do bench,

2754
01:07:13,661 --> 01:07:14,171
breasts,

2755
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:15,040
flies,

2756
01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:16,240
Dumbbell,

2757
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,201
and man,

2758
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:18,010
I never had it.

2759
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:21,440
Chess and my is and never had it.

2760
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:25,270
I try so hard to train for
it and never had volume right

2761
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,730
here and,

2762
01:07:26,731 --> 01:07:29,160
and you know it's genetic man is,

2763
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:30,001
that's the way it is.

2764
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:30,361
So I said,

2765
01:07:30,361 --> 01:07:31,194
you know what?

2766
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:32,730
You know,

2767
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:33,541
I'm not gonna do it,

2768
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:33,781
man.

2769
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:34,930
I'm going to do for gym.

2770
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,570
Like I give up on it.

2771
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:37,761
I gave up my,

2772
01:07:37,761 --> 01:07:38,700
I have big legs,

2773
01:07:38,701 --> 01:07:38,941
big,

2774
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:39,570
big butts,

2775
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:39,871
big,

2776
01:07:39,871 --> 01:07:40,560
big,

2777
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:41,393
big,

2778
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,310
big cat cock.

2779
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,240
I'm going to say it,

2780
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:46,770
but you know what I mean?

2781
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:46,961
I,

2782
01:07:46,961 --> 01:07:47,580
I don't,

2783
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:48,810
I don't have chess man.

2784
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:49,770
I tried to work,

2785
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:50,520
but it's done.

2786
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:51,480
One of these things that,

2787
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:52,290
you know,

2788
01:07:52,290 --> 01:07:53,071
I give up on it,

2789
01:07:53,071 --> 01:07:53,400
man.

2790
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:58,110
I gave up plants do with Tommy
Morrison did get breast implants.

2791
01:07:59,120 --> 01:07:59,880
Yeah.

2792
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,760
But there's a lot of ways
that I can use to have chess,

2793
01:08:02,761 --> 01:08:03,210
you know?

2794
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:05,280
Have you seen that at the time
he Morrison breast implants?

2795
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:05,521
No,

2796
01:08:05,521 --> 01:08:06,490
I don't remember telling me.

2797
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:06,811
Morrison,

2798
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:09,020
the boxer they got out of the,

2799
01:08:09,021 --> 01:08:11,280
at the aids that day.

2800
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,153
Yes.

2801
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,190
Yes he has.

2802
01:08:14,191 --> 01:08:15,060
He has a disease.

2803
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:15,490
Yes.

2804
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,323
This is,

2805
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:16,870
yeah,

2806
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:17,211
I heard,

2807
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:19,250
I heard that he also got breast implants.

2808
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:19,850
I really,

2809
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:20,100
yeah.

2810
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:20,933
Pull that up Ryan.

2811
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:21,631
Pull it up.

2812
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,051
Tell me more.

2813
01:08:22,051 --> 01:08:22,520
So breasts,

2814
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,353
implants.

2815
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:24,120
Why?

2816
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,110
Why am I doing this?

2817
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:25,351
Okay,

2818
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,220
here's why folks,

2819
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:29,280
cause if there's a guy out there that's
thinking about getting breast implants

2820
01:08:29,281 --> 01:08:30,450
and I can talk about of it,

2821
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,460
I got to do my job.

2822
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,593
He got to see this.

2823
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,130
Take a look at this fucking picture.

2824
01:08:35,370 --> 01:08:36,600
This is Tommy Morrison.

2825
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:38,760
He has a pull it up.

2826
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:39,470
Yeah,

2827
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:40,303

2828
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:42,120
Is this it?

2829
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:42,690
Yes.

2830
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,320
Look at that.

2831
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,610
Oh man,

2832
01:08:44,611 --> 01:08:45,444
that's not good,

2833
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:49,883
Huh?

2834
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:51,991
Oh Man.

2835
01:08:51,991 --> 01:08:53,310
That's not that good man.

2836
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:54,960
That's hilarious.

2837
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:56,790
Wow.

2838
01:08:56,790 --> 01:08:57,111
That's,

2839
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:57,944
yeah,

2840
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:58,793
don't do that.

2841
01:08:59,370 --> 01:08:59,971
That's what I'm saying.

2842
01:08:59,971 --> 01:09:00,510
Folks.

2843
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:01,860
Anybody to anybody.

2844
01:09:01,861 --> 01:09:02,820
Please listen to me.

2845
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:06,300
Is there an unauthorized
biography of you as well?

2846
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:06,601
Yes,

2847
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:07,434
there is.

2848
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,030
I don't know.

2849
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:09,481
It is.

2850
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:10,314
It's sad.

2851
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,090
He called up my mom.

2852
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:11,281
You know,

2853
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:12,660
my parents are very nice people.

2854
01:09:12,661 --> 01:09:12,961
You know,

2855
01:09:12,961 --> 01:09:13,200
they,

2856
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:13,410
you,

2857
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,640
they from countryside.

2858
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:16,800
They always very respectful to everybody.

2859
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:17,970
And this guy up,

2860
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:18,290
Ronnie,

2861
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:19,800
he called up my mom and my dad,

2862
01:09:19,801 --> 01:09:20,071
my dad,

2863
01:09:20,071 --> 01:09:21,030
who is a old ice go,

2864
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:21,731
oh Yo,

2865
01:09:21,731 --> 01:09:22,240
Yo Yo,

2866
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,340
you answer all their questions.

2867
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:24,601
And I told my friends,

2868
01:09:24,601 --> 01:09:28,430
I stopped answering question that
people call like this man because he's,

2869
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:28,740
you know,

2870
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,340
they're a little bit,

2871
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:30,230
it's a little bit native.

2872
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,051
They don't know what this,

2873
01:09:31,051 --> 01:09:31,380
this,

2874
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:31,801
this thing.

2875
01:09:31,801 --> 01:09:33,360
So I said he just stopped
talking to people.

2876
01:09:33,361 --> 01:09:34,160
You don't know about that.

2877
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,700
Like asshole just wrote
a book based in Yes,

2878
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:38,410
yes he did.

2879
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:39,243
Yeah.

2880
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:39,630
It's a,

2881
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:40,530
it's a bad book.

2882
01:09:40,531 --> 01:09:40,631
It,

2883
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:43,200
he only talk about my fights.

2884
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:45,210
He basically described but my fight,

2885
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,400
you don't say anything
person or he doesn't know me.

2886
01:09:47,401 --> 01:09:47,860
He doesn't know.

2887
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,693
Right.

2888
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:49,160
Yeah.

2889
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:50,830
So that's not a real unauthorized,

2890
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,340
no,

2891
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:51,441
no,

2892
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:51,560
no,

2893
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:51,691
no.

2894
01:09:51,691 --> 01:09:52,220
Real one.

2895
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:55,700
The real one is the way the
fight it's available on Amazon.

2896
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:58,190
You can go by right now it's
available in bookstores.

2897
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:58,970
Can,

2898
01:09:58,970 --> 01:09:59,340
uh,

2899
01:09:59,340 --> 01:09:59,661
yeah,

2900
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:00,710
you can get it on a kindle.

2901
01:10:00,711 --> 01:10:02,060
You can get it on audible.com.

2902
01:10:02,061 --> 01:10:02,920
Can you get it on audible?

2903
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:04,430
Are you talking it?

2904
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:06,600
It's me.

2905
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,020
Yeah,

2906
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:07,720
it's you doing it,

2907
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:08,720
you read are doing.

2908
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,950
I started doing it when I,

2909
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,371
when I,

2910
01:10:10,371 --> 01:10:11,204
uh,

2911
01:10:11,230 --> 01:10:12,590
had my ACL surgery.

2912
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:13,800
Ah,

2913
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:15,680
that's where I started
writing down stuff and,

2914
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:17,950
but I didn't wrote all the words myself.

2915
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,501
It's an English.

2916
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:18,770
I know,

2917
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:19,603
right?

2918
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,850
It's made with someone I needed like a,

2919
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:23,360
so you don't write it in English at all?

2920
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:24,194
You just speak it?

2921
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:25,611
I write English,

2922
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:25,971
but I,

2923
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:26,440
I would,

2924
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:26,691
you know,

2925
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:30,050
I would not write a book in English
because it has been made in English first,

2926
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:30,884
then in French.

2927
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:31,430
So it's,

2928
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:31,650
it's,

2929
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:34,520
his name is just thinking sleep
was a friend of mine who wrote it.

2930
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:37,520
We wrote a damn book far for me,

2931
01:10:37,790 --> 01:10:38,180
but I,

2932
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,750
you took stuff that I say and I had in
my notes stuff that I write myself in

2933
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:42,061
French.

2934
01:10:42,061 --> 01:10:42,231
He's,

2935
01:10:42,231 --> 01:10:42,650
he's,

2936
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:43,830
he speak both languages by,

2937
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:46,010
he switched it to the book.

2938
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,441
Oh,

2939
01:10:46,441 --> 01:10:46,561
he's,

2940
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:48,200
so you switched into English.

2941
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:48,740
It's an a,

2942
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:49,910
it's not a biography.

2943
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:51,350
It's not about that MMA boy,

2944
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,131
it's not a book for him.

2945
01:10:52,131 --> 01:10:53,930
I mean it's booked for
margin rolled through,

2946
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:54,810
you know,

2947
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:55,730
what's it all about?

2948
01:10:55,890 --> 01:11:00,740
It's about my w the
tactic that I use to be,

2949
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:03,530
to start where I come from
and to be world champion.

2950
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,200
I find myself goals and uh,

2951
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:09,870
a drizzle of reputation and I keep
doing everyday and that's how,

2952
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:10,320
you know.

2953
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,360
So that's what the book is about.

2954
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:11,480
Yeah,

2955
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,230
it's more philosophical stuff.

2956
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,120
Oh well it's more philosophical book.

2957
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,470
It has nothing to do with MMA.

2958
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:17,580
You talk about them and me,

2959
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:22,140
but it's like people that like it normally
is people because it's not as been

2960
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:23,460
written by an MMA guy.

2961
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:24,161
The guy were written,

2962
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:25,590
he doesn't know nothing about MMA.

2963
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,350
Even they may me people don't they,

2964
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,980
it might be to see the
terms I it because it emit,

2965
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:31,380
you know,

2966
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:34,650
sometime little miss [inaudible]
car wreck and the future that would

2967
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:35,491
misunderstood.

2968
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:35,671
But,

2969
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:40,671
but he's is a book about a
philosophy and the mindset of,

2970
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,840
of someone where I come from,

2971
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:45,120
ally became successful from my experience.

2972
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,650
Well George,

2973
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:47,880
you're a bad motherfucker.

2974
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,870
You're a cool guy.

2975
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,730
It's always a great to talk to you.

2976
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,653
Thank you.

2977
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:51,880
I'm,

2978
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,070
I'm glad to be a friend.

2979
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:58,071
And it was a w one of the coolest things
in my life is being able to teach you a

2980
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,790
pastoral attorney sidekick,

2981
01:11:59,791 --> 01:12:02,640
and the fact that you would even listen
to me when I tell you that I had a good

2982
01:12:02,641 --> 01:12:03,474
one.

2983
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:04,580
I'm going to do it enough.

2984
01:12:04,581 --> 01:12:05,890
I'd want that from Msu.

2985
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:06,470
I brought,

2986
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:07,530
I'm not comfortable enough.

2987
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,841
Fab.

2988
01:12:07,841 --> 01:12:09,040
