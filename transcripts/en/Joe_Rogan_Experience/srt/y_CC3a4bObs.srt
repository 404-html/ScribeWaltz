official US postage,
slap it on the old box post man comes,

You don't have to talk to some completely
under motivated and underwhelmed

22
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,170
person who really doesn't
want to be there at all.

23
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,270
Much rather beat you over
the head with a club.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,260
Then weigh your stupid fucking packages.
You don't have to do any of that.

25

All you have to do is go to stamps.com

This is the way to co kid tourist me

33
00:01:59,971 --> 00:02:00,780

We'll also,

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,830
we're also brought to you by legal zoom.

37
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,900
Legal Zoom is a fantastic
way to deal with St Lo.

38
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,030
I like stamps.com you can deal with
shit from your home that you would

39
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:20,790
ordinarily have to go somewhere for them.
With legal zoom,

40
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:24,660
you could deal with so many legal
issues without having to schedule an

41
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:29,040
appointment with a lawyer on their time.
Drive through traffic park,

42
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,580
sit down, paying an exorbitant amount
of money to some person. Again,

43
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:35,340
who doesn't really want to fucking
talk to you, they just want your cash.

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,410
You could do all that stuff at home and
do it for a fraction of the cost and do

45
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,880
it quite easily. You can form an LLC
or incorporate start your own business.

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,540
Very easy to do. You can apply for
a patent to secure an invention,

47
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,830
register your trademark to protect your
products and services and you could do

48
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:55,320
it all drunk and naked.
No one can stop you.

49
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,170
You can take illegal drugs
and do something legal.
Do you know that? I'm not,

50
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,160
I'm not advising it,
but if you so chose to do it,

51
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,930
it is your right as a person,

52
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,410
as long as you do everything correctly
and everything's filled out the way it's

53
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:10,240
supposed to be,
you're good.

54
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,220
And if it's not filled out
the way it's supposed to be,

55
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,720
here's the beauty of legal zoom.

56
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:17,500
Legal Zoom can connect you to a
third party independent attorney.

57
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,880
If you're in a cold sweat panic and you
think that you've done something illegal.

58
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,990
If you filled out the forms and you're
like, this shit is not gonna fly,

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,560
you can contact legal zoom and they
will hook you up with a third party

60
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,650
attorney.
Legal Zoom is not a law firm,

61
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,780
but they do provide you with legal self
help through independent attorneys.

62
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,220
See legal self help is the way to do it.

63
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,780
If you can get things done like
filing patents, like for me,

64
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:53,200
LLCs forming a will,
you can even get divorced.

65
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,080
You can get divorced through legal zoom
and they have an a plus rating from the

66
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:03,400
better business bureau. You can't go
wrong with that. A plus, not a minus,

67
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,480
not B plus a plus from the better
business bureau over the past 14 years.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,280
They've helped over a million
businesses get started, right?

69
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,580
Go to legal zoom.com and
when you go through the month
of June and you can get a

70
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:21,100
special price on trademark,

71
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:26,110
copyright or provisional patent
applications by using the referral code,

72
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,700
Rogan at checkout,

73
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,870
celebrate innovation with legal
zoom through the end of June.

74
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,020
I remember legal zoom is not a la farm,

75
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,430
but they do provide you with legal
help through independent attorneys.

76
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,040
Someone's trying to fucking text me
in the middle of a God damn podcast.

77
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,530
I guess they don't listen anyway,

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,340
go to legal zoom.com use the
code word Rogan at checkout.

79
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,373
You hear that weird noise.

80
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,280
You hear that?
You don't hear that?

81
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,510
I think it's the phone. I think if I
put my phone near my computer, they'd,

82
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,990
they'd fucking argue with each other.

83
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:07,720
And telepathically it's probably
what it is. Um, that's it. Legal,

84
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,240
zoom.com use a codeword Rogan.
We're also brought to you by ting.

85
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,020
Ting is a mobile service
that does things differently,

86
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,240
did do things on their own terms.

87
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,420
And what that means is they buy
time through the sprint backbone.

88
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,600
They use sprints. So you get the exact
same service that you get with sprint,

89
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,070
but you get it with no contracts,
no early termination fees,

90
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:31,980
no nonsense.
They don't trick you.

91
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,190
And there's a lot of ways that
cell phone companies make money.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,980
And one of the ways
they make money is they,

93
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,960
they charge you for x amount per month.
Like, you know, you have a deal where you,

94
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:45,810
you know, you get 1200 minutes a
month or whatever the hell it is.

95
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,500
But when you do that, most of the
time you're not using those minutes,

96
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:53,010
but you're still paying for those minutes.
The weighting does it.

97
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,930
It's a very smart and I,

98
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:58,360
and I think it's a better way and I think
it's the only way that they're going

99
00:05:58,361 --> 00:06:02,510
to do it in the future. What what
they do is you pay for what you use.

100
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:05,990
If you use a lot, you pay
more. If you use very little,

101
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,020
you pay less and 98% of people
would save money using tank.

102
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,740
That's a pretty incredible statistic.
If you go to Tim's website,

103
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,720
go to [inaudible] dot com they'll explain
the whole thing to $21 is the average

104
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:25,230
monthly bill per device for tin customers.
That's amazing because you'd be,

105
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,630
you'd be surprised at how little when you,
when you look at the service minutes,

106
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:32,270
you know, you know like a hundred
minutes a month, 200 minutes a month.

107
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,380
Most of the time people are texting each
other's days and if you call me a lot,

108
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,300
man, most of the time I
don't pick up the phone.

109
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,130
I don't spend a lot of
time calling people.

110
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,460
$440 is the average annual savings per
device for a business with one to 20

111
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,520
employees. So if you have a
business, Tang is the way to go.

112
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:52,520
If you want to set up business phones
and you have many options as far as the

113
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,354
phones themselves,

114
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:58,370
you have all of the best android phones
that are available today and you buy

115
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:03,320
them. You don't see the thing about when
you go to one of the big name cell phone

116
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:06,440
companies and you get a phone,
you're not actually buying the phone.

117
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,070
Like if you pay $200 for a phone, you're
not really paying $200 for that phone.

118
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,380
The phone costs probably five or 600
bucks and you think you're paying $200 but

119
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:20,420
the other 300 to $400 you're paying
off over the course of your contract.

120
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,940
That's why if you try to leave,

121
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,240
they say stick it to you and they make
you pay what you owe them and so it's,

122
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,240
that's what a contract termination fee is.

123
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,390
What's all about is you
still owe money on a device.

124
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:38,540
You essentially leased a device.
Tink doesn't handle it that way at all.

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,070
With Ting. Everything that you, you,
you purchase, what did they sell at?

126
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,840
[inaudible] dot com rogan.ting.com here
are the finest cell phones available

127
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:50,810
today. Like the, excuse me,

128
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,060
Samsung Galaxy s five,
which is water resistant.

129
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,630
Just added water resistant. If you're
a fucking dork like me, you spell shit.

130
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,110
That's the way to go. They
have a, the HTC one m eight,

131
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,490
all of the best new android phones,
the Samsung Galaxy note three,

132
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:11,120
which I use fantastic phone. You
can draw on it. It has a pen.

133
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,390
How could you go wrong? And if you
like one of those old crazy grandmas,

134
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,630
they have flip phones, they
have everything. And uh,

135
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,200
as cheap as 42 bucks,
you can get a phone for 42 bucks,

136
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,790
which is kind of ridiculous
in this day and age.

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,150
And when you buy it for 42 bucks,
you actually buy it for 42 bucks.

138
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,150
And if you know, you know, you try for
a while and he'd go, you know what,

139
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,140
I want to cancel. Just canceled. That's
it. You don't have to worry about shit.

140
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,000
It's a beautiful ethical
way to do business. And the
results have been fantastic.

141
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,180
Massive, massive public, um,

142
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,570
positive feedback that I've received from
all the people that have switched over

143
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,820
to tank saved money,
loved the company,

144
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,480
loved the idea behind the company and
love the fact that they have a wide

145
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,860
selection of devices.

146
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,190
So go to rogan.ting.com today
and save yourself some cash kids.

147
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,880
All right,
my friend Steve Hilton is here.

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,150
We're going to talk about all kinds
of groovy shit. Let's cue the music

149
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,643
experience.

150
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,270
Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast,

151
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,260
Steve Hilton, my friend
politics are dirty business,

152
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,430
very dirty.
But just before we get into that show you,

153
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,390
I just want to say you've already
really offended me. Fantastic.

154
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:29,680
Just want to show you my phone.
Oh, what have you got here?

155
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:34,630
It is a flip phone. So in your
words, an old crazy grandma.

156
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,750
Well, I have many friends
that carry old flip phones,

157
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:40,960
but I'm glad that you're actually
just carrying a phone. Exactly.

158
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:44,710
This is a very new development for
me. Well, it's a good move. So good.

159
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,180
Everyone's been telling you,
I've got to have a phone.

160
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:48,670
I had not had a phone for many years.

161
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,430
Finally I buckled under the pressure
and I got one of these Steve.

162
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,900
Um, we became friends in Hawaii or
friends or family and we're all friends.

163
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,250
It's a, it's a very cool little,
uh, development. I really enjoy it.

164
00:10:03,251 --> 00:10:06,640
But I think it, I think it's
quite hilarious that, uh,

165
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,680
your wife is involved in Google
and you avoid phones at all costs.

166
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,000
You avoid technology. You feel that
it's too entrenched in our life.

167
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:20,140
This sort of a digital web that
we've all been connected to. Yeah.

168
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:24,160
I'm trying to fight it,
Joe. It's tough though.

169
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:27,490
That's the beautiful thing. When you
don't want to use them, you shut them off.

170
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,280
Yeah.
But that,

171
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,800
that kind of nagging away knowing that's
discipline meditates probably, right.

172
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,170
Well, I feel that there's benefits and
there's certainly negatives to phones,

173
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,260
but I think the positive
aspects outweigh the negative.

174
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,670
I like being able to communicate with
friends and family and loved ones and sent

175
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:50,260
texts. And I, I, I find it
incredibly addictive though.

176
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,000
And I think it becomes,

177
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,850
I was out at dinner the other day with
a bunch of friends and everyone was on

178
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:56,590
the ground, damn phone.
There was five of us,

179
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,440
and I was like sitting around
a table looking at everybody,

180
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:03,640
texting and tweeting and taking photos.
I'm like, we're not even here right now.

181
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,100
I'm like, you guys are, you're
connected to this digital world.

182
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:08,650
You're talking about how awesome it is
to be here, but you're not even here.

183
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,730
You barely paying attention as new sort
of etiquette developing about, you know,

184
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:15,300
how to handle this when there's, I think
I was reading something about, well,

185
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:18,490
you've got eight people around a table
having dinner and it's okay for three of

186
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:20,650
them to be looking at their devices.
That's okay.

187
00:11:20,651 --> 00:11:22,030
But if it gets to more than three,

188
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:24,040
someone's got to look up
because that's the rule.

189
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,450
Who says says who establish what?
I don't get it. It's just there.

190
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,020
It's just like anything else.
I mean,

191
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:36,370
if you're at a bar with some friends and
one guy's just watching TV only and not

192
00:11:36,371 --> 00:11:39,700
engaging in a conversation, that's just
as rude. Yeah, I think that's right.

193
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:44,860
I find it fascinating. Um, how
my children react to devices.

194
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,710
That's where I really get a sense of
it because they don't have a cultural

195
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:48,850
context.
You know,

196
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:53,320
when my four year old watches television
or watches devices and I'll stand front

197
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,190
of her while she's watching

198
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,680
TV and she just reaches
up and tries to move me,

199
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,080
like she doesn't give a
fuck what I'm thinking.

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,120
She's just trying to watch this program.
Yeah. You literally can't get in between.

201
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,820
And that point it's like I've really
noticed that if you just, you know,

202
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:08,980
they're watching something,
that's it. You know, you may,

203
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,950
you may have been away for a week
and you haven't seen them and they're

204
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:15,750
desperate to see, but if there's something
on TV at that point, no interested.

205
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,470
Yeah. It trumps everything. It trumps
all human interaction and it's,

206
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:23,980
it's very weird how it does it.
It does it in this strange hypnotic way.

207
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:28,270
There's nothing else on earth that
gets a four year old to just sit there

208
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,370
motionless, right. And engage. But it
literally stimulates parts of the brand.

209
00:12:33,371 --> 00:12:36,190
There's a lot of quite interesting brain
science about what's going on when,

210
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,860
when kids watch TV and
it's generally fine,

211
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:42,130
but when it gets to a point where they're
watching you no more than two or three

212
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,580
hours a day, and a lot of kids
these days are in that situation,

213
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:49,800
it literally starts rewiring their
brain. Yeah. It's not healthy to,

214
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,610
to completely entrench yourself in that
world and to be in that world all day,

215
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,520
every day. But a lot of people
do because it's possible.

216
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,530
But I think that's just
like everything else.

217
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,770
It's like I liked the option to
be able to buy a cheeseburger.

218
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,110
I don't think you should eat
cheeseburgers every day, all day,

219
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,520
but I like it if I want one from driving
by in and out, and I'm like, let's do it.

220
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,000
You know, it's, it's not the best
food for you, but I like the option.

221
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,430
I totally agree with that. I liked
that for television. I liked,

222
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,560
I liked watching swamp people
watch that fuck for naught,

223
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,710
terrible show about a bunch of people,
alligator hunting. And it's, it's,

224
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,360
it's the most predictable show of all
time because they're look for alligators

225
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,900
and occasionally they get alligators,
but there's nothing unusual happens.

226
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,650
They don't run into a giraffe like what
the fuck it was a draft in the swamp. No,

227
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,030
it's just alligators.

228
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,870
And these people were these strange
southern accents in boats and they have

229
00:13:40,871 --> 00:13:41,740
fishing line.

230
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:44,410
They catch the alligator with fishing
line that sometimes they shoot the

231
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:49,030
alligators, but it's just
alligator hunters. But they
call it swamp people. Yeah.

232
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,880
I haven't seen that. I'm not sure
that's going to be top of my list.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,100
You should invest, you should
invest your time, you know, doing,

234
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,970
doing a little bit of
everything. I remember when, um,

235
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,860
do you remember that movie came out at
that Mcdonald's supersize me and this guy

236
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:07,380
got ill and fun. Is Morgan Spurlock?
Yes. Um, you know, he made it,

237
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,231
he made a good point.

238
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:11,530
But my favorite response to that
was from Mcdonald's when the,

239
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,860
the guy who runs Mcdonald's
in Australia went on,

240
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,220
they took commercials and they went on
air when there's this big PR storm about

241
00:14:18,221 --> 00:14:21,310
the terrible Mcdonald's food and
all this kind of stuff and he,

242
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,640
he went on air with these commercials
and I'm going to now attempt very badly

243
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:28,030
and Australian accent.
Okay. Then most people hate,

244
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:30,590
probably couldn't tell the
difference between the British
and Australian. Anyway,

245
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,990
talking about the same. I know,
I get it, I get it. And he said,

246
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,440
um, apparently there's some
bloke he's going around saying,

247
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:43,000
if you eat too much of our food and don't
take any exercise, you get fat. Well,

248
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:47,020
I could've told you that. I just got
really sweet response, which is, yeah,

249
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,070
we'll have something that's not good,
but a little bit's okay.

250
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,400
That's a quite Australian

251
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,350
response to as opposed to the measured
American legalees that you'd probably

252
00:14:57,351 --> 00:14:59,950
hear from [inaudible]. Good. Yeah. Yeah.

253
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,590
You know I have a real issue
with that documentary and with,

254
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,710
he did a show also called 30 days
because I know what they're doing there.

255
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,390
They're not necessarily
just investigating, right?

256
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,830
They're also trying to achieve a desired
result and that desired result being

257
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,700
something bad.
They're,

258
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:21,770
they're trying to do
something that's going to be
titillating and oh my goodness,

259
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:26,030
his liver is going bad. Like he's,
he's sick, he's sick, he's toxic.

260
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,340
There's a lot of people that
have called bullshit on that,

261
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,610
especially the liver toxins and all
that stuff. They're like, where's this?

262
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,900
Where's the liver toxin?

263
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:36,980
You're dealing with carbohydrates and
proteins and you know, and, and fats,

264
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,580
but it's not like this. These things
aren't toxic. They're just not good.

265
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,080
They're just high in cholesterol and
they're kind of fatty and sugary. Yup.

266
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,380
But I know for a fact that they
did some fuckery on his show.

267
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,620
He had a show called 30 days where
he's trying to achieve the same results

268
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,650
because they went to a friend
of mine who's a doctor and he,

269
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:59,150
this doctor specializes in hormone
replacement therapy for older people,

270
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,020
for older people and people that are,
you know like you start getting older,

271
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:06,470
you want to replace your testosterone
and things along those lines and they

272
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:10,040
wanted to do it in 30 days and they
wanted to do it on this program.

273
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:13,700
Take a man who's getting older and in
30 days injected with hormones and the

274
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:17,270
doctor who's an ethical doctor said,
you don't ever do that. He said,

275
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:18,320
we'd never do that.
And he said,

276
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:22,100
well we would do is we would get you on
a proper diet. I would take your blood,

277
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,500
it would take a week to get
your blood results back.

278
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,760
I get your blood results back.

279
00:16:25,761 --> 00:16:30,230
I'd want to get a detailed analysis of
what you're eating, what you're doing,

280
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:31,400
what kind of a lifestyle do you have.

281
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:33,800
It's not a simple fix
like we give you hormones.

282
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,300
So what they did is they found a quack
doctor who did just shoot the guy up with

283
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,010
hormones and the guy was like,
oh,

284
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:44,330
roid rage and angry afterwards and his
fucking was wife wanted to keep him

285
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:46,670
chubby. I mean the whole thing
was a disaster. It was like,

286
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,940
this is not an ethical examination
of this. It makes it real.

287
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,060
It's, it's like it's entertainment.
It's not a documentary or something.

288
00:16:56,061 --> 00:17:00,650
It's deceiving though. The problem with
entertainment is it's not a puppet show.

289
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,560
Okay. It's not a cartoon. You're,

290
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,480
you're pretending that
you're exploring these ideas.

291
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,210
And when I was doing that Scifi show,

292
00:17:08,211 --> 00:17:13,211
I found some similar issues with certain
producers and certain people who were

293
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:19,211
used to that world of reality TV
reality TV has become this very strange

294
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:24,941
mishmash of choreographed choreograph
scenarios and predetermined scenarios,

295
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,100
predetermined results.

296
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,630
And they do it sort of in
this guise of reality TV.

297
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,380
But it's sir, it's essentially, it's
like loosely scripted bullshit. Yeah.

298
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,090
And they're pretending that it's like,

299
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:41,690
this is what's going on in the
doctor's office. No, you set that up.

300
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,730
That's not what goes on
at a doctor's office.

301
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:46,100
It's not what would go
on at a doctor's office.

302
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,980
You're pretending because that's
going to get people to freak out.

303
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,250
They took the an agenda,

304
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,470
you know, they're trying to make
a point and they set up like that.

305
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,900
They edit it like that. It's, you
know, it's totally right. Well,

306
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:58,650
the whole business is completely fucked
because the business has started off

307
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:01,560
with a bunch of people that
came over from scripted shows.

308
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,540
So the legacy people that were involved
in these dramatic shows where there were

309
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,410
no, until survivor came along,
there were no reality shows,

310
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:12,940
quote unquote reality shows.
So I go,

311
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:17,280
I have a deep understanding of this
because I hosted fear factor for six years

312
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,410
and because fear factor came in in 2002
which was when all the reality shows

313
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,244
were being born.

314
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,120
So I got to see where these people had
their backgrounds from and almost all of

315
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:32,121
them had their backgrounds from traumas
or from sitcoms or from the world of

316
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,510
fictional shows.

317
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,250
So much so that you were considered to
be like a trader if you were involved in

318
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,140
reality show,
like people,

319
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:45,170
people got mad at me that saying that
I was taking jobs away from a writers

320
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,900
because I was involved in, in
reality shows. And I was like, oh,

321
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:50,280
this is hilarious argument.

322
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,640
But these people all came from this world
where you manipulate things in order

323
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:00,420
to make drama. So they started doing
that to the quote unquote reality shows.

324
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,650
So that's what you're getting.

325
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,860
So this 30 days show that doesn't exist
anymore and supersize me show there,

326
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:08,963
you know,

327
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,860
you're tackling very complex issues and
you're doing it and it to entertaining

328
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,420
form. And when you do that, there's
some integrity that's sort of like,

329
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,990
it goes by the wayside. But I think
that's right. And that integrity,

330
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,690
I think I had a real example
of that. You, in the end,

331
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:29,370
you're relying on the people involved to
have a bit of integrity and ethics and

332
00:19:29,371 --> 00:19:30,300
the way they do their jobs.

333
00:19:30,301 --> 00:19:35,100
And I just saw little example this
weekend I was out doing stuff and I did,

334
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,460
uh, to do with the election.
In my company. And we did a,

335
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,250
I did an interview for the local news,
NBC News,

336
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,810
and we were doing some demos of stuff
with people in Santa Monica and um,

337
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,340
they wanted to film one of the people
that were doing it with, you know,

338
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
interacting with our thing. Right. But
with our website and at that point,

339
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,950
no, they weren't any people interested
in doing that. So one of the teams said,

340
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,790
why don't we just pretend to be
a member of the public doing it?

341
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,230
And it's really interesting because
they said, no, the producer and the Gen,

342
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:10,800
they said, no, no, it's going to be,
you know, a real member of the public.

343
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:13,950
And I thought that was really cool. You
know, they, they obviously want it to go,

344
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,690
they were busy.
They had to get back to the studio.

345
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:19,080
They were really annoyed that they're
having to wait a long time for an actual

346
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:23,040
member of the public. But they really
did say no, we were not going to fake it.

347
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,630
And it would've been so easy and no one
would have noticed. And in that moment,

348
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,190
it was literally just that personal
integrity. And it was really cool to see.

349
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,770
And I, I hope that's really
widespread in the news business,

350
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:35,730
but it was just for me,

351
00:20:35,731 --> 00:20:38,880
a really interesting example of you
can make rules and you can have stuff,

352
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:42,750
but in the end it's about people
and their choices in the moment.

353
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,200
It is interesting that they
chose to do that with integrity,

354
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,420
but it's also interesting
that someone suggested

355
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,840
they'd not. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And
that's the, that's the other side of it.

356
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:55,570
But it was, I was really pleased
that that's what they decided to do.

357
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,630
I did a show for CBS wants, um, called
game show in my head. And the, uh,

358
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,670
the premise of the show was you would
have this little earpiece in that someone

359
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:07,270
could talk to you in.

360
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,200
So I would put an ear piece in
the contestants and send them out.

361
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,010
And when they would be standing
somewhere, I'd say, okay, can you hear me?

362
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:17,560
And they say, yes. All right,
here's what's going on.

363
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,920
And then these two guys came in with
cameras that were holding cameras.

364
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,640
You are a reporter on the news.
Here's your scenario.

365
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,750
Someone called in a Ufo sighting.

366
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,840
They saw a Ufo sighting.
We brought in the cameras.

367
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,630
Unfortunately that person went away.

368
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,500
So when you have to do is convince some
member of the public that's around there

369
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,680
to take that person's place and to say
that they were the ones who saw this Ufo

370
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,710
and you have to get them to say that they
were taking a board this Ufo and that

371
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:55,260
they were examined by aliens.
And so the guy, you know, it was,

372
00:21:55,261 --> 00:21:58,450
it was kind of funny. They're like, okay,
here we go. All right, how do I do this?

373
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,430
What was shocking was how many people
when you put that camera on them

374
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,780
immediately said they would do it
and immediately started just lying.

375
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,280
Just lying. It was a silver craft.
I mean, all walks of life. Uh,

376
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,720
very few people said no.

377
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,570
That was the most shocking thing
when you had the camera on them.

378
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,840
They just started talking and they started
sort of repeating these iconic images

379
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:25,800
that you always hear. The discs
shape things, silver with knee,

380
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,320
there was no bolts on it.
They,

381
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,170
they were like going into detail talking
about though the medical examinations

382
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:37,030
and, and this, this guy who I
think it was a guy and a girl, um,

383
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,340
you know these contestants
who had to do this.

384
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,850
We're just talking to these people and
we will all the producers in the truck,

385
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:46,270
we're all looking at each other like,
wow, people are fucking full of shit.

386
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,560
This is so weird.

387
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:52,561
It's so weird how easy it is for some
people to just justify making up a story

388
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,500
just in order for them to be on camera.
But what did you think?

389
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:58,060
It's because they just,

390
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,820
it's the camera they want to be on the
camera was that they want to please the

391
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:04,840
other person. They want to be on TV.
Look clever. It could be that as well.

392
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,150
But I think most likely it's,

393
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:10,270
they want to be on television
so they could go home,

394
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,320
set their DVR and you know, it's on
it. It's not an Automaton, that's me.

395
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,940
I have fucking lion, you know, they
just wanted to be on television.

396
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,190
I think for a lot of
people in this day and age,

397
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,330
that is just some sort of a weird,
ultimate goal.

398
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,320
Just to have that camera on them and
then they go home and see it. Right.

399
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,550
Whether it makes sense or not. And for
a lot of folks, it doesn't make sense.

400
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,540
A lot of folks, you know, they wind the
winds up ruining their lives. You know,

401
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,150
they, they find out how
other people feel about them.

402
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,330
Plus you expose yourself to the critique
of millions of anonymous people filled

403
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:46,934
with hate,

404
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,410
filled with hate and disappointment their
own life and just ready to spew venom

405
00:23:51,411 --> 00:23:55,250
in your direction. They just can't win
that shit all over you, Steve Hill.

406
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,610
Well,
this is the judge you

407
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,540
this,
we had another thing this weekend.

408
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,200
We went out and made a little film just
to test that out about the elections

409
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,180
going on in, in, in La. And we
literally went up to people and, um,

410
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,800
made up candidates that were
running for Congress and a nice,

411
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:16,860
what they thought about that,
you know,

412
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,750
and what do you think of Angelina Jolie
running for Congress? And they towed it.

413
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,050
Yeah. This is guide. Yeah. I was so
excited when I heard that. That's great.

414
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,290
You know,
I think she's great and it just,

415
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,620
you can't believe how people just
engage with these things. This is made,

416
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,310
it just made it up and
they just went with it.

417
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:33,950
Like you were saying with the Ufo thing,
he was like going on about it.

418
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:36,320
It wasn't just saying, yeah, I
heard about that. That's great.

419
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:40,490
He was sort of embellishing
it. Just ridiculous. Yeah.

420
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:43,010
People are fucking strange man.
That's strange range

421
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:43,843
and that's um,

422
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:48,710
it's a real problem when it
comes to politics or anything.

423
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,300
When you're allowing people to make
choices that can affect others.

424
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,640
People are weird,
you know,

425
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:58,850
and a good percentage of
them are really dominant,

426
00:24:58,851 --> 00:25:02,030
uninformed and not interested.
I mean they,

427
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,460
when you say dumb and uninformed,

428
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:09,830
here's what I think when I say
that, what, when I'm saying dumb,

429
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,860
what I mean is if the human
mind is a essentially a say,

430
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:20,030
if everyone has the exact same physical
structure, the exact same genetics,

431
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,860
exact same hormonal system,

432
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:27,280
and one person does yoga every day and
eats healthy and does chin ups in the

433
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,320
morning when they wake up and drinks a
lot of water and the other person sits in

434
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:37,880
front of the TV, likes to smoke
cigarettes, eats nothing but sugar,

435
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:43,420
you get to see the results of the one
person being very aware of their body and

436
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:45,680
taking care of their body
and the other person not.

437
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,380
Will you get that same
effect with the life?

438
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,950
You get that same effect with how
you approach the world itself.

439
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,790
Some people approach the
world through this lazy,

440
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:59,270
disconnected,
you know,

441
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,100
like pop culture obsessed,
nonsensical,

442
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,300
just pop culture obsessed.
Jamie talking to you, you fuck,

443
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,970
he's a little pop culture,
so not too bad.

444
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,680
Jamie's aware of a lot of other shit too,
but some people just,

445
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,670
they don't enrich their life. They
don't enrich their mind. They don't.

446
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,170
They're not.
They're not curious.

447
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,560
And those people with all these poor
decisions and drug addictions and the

448
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:28,484
life's a mess,

449
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,580
they have an equal say to the person
who's rational and aware and kind and

450
00:26:34,641 --> 00:26:36,860
objective,
equal say,

451
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,570
and I think that's one of the
weirdest things about communities,

452
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,500
about culture.

453
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,220
It's about to figure out how do you
mitigate the effects of the lazy.

454
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,690
How do you, how do you deal with the
effects of the morons? Like when,

455
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,490
when you have a riot and people start
pulling white people out of cars and

456
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,090
throwing rocks at their heads, which
they've had in Los Angeles in the past,

457
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:03,810
especially after the Rodney King
beating and things along those lines,

458
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:08,250
just random white people just attack them.
How do you,

459
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,361
how do you,

460
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:14,140
how do you allow when you see these things
can happen and then just use that and

461
00:27:14,141 --> 00:27:14,821
it's an example.

462
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:18,000
It could be a million other things
that are really stupid that people do.

463
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:24,290
How could it be that one person gets
one vote and another person who is very

464
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:32,490
aware,
another person is very educated.

465
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Another person who's very kind and very
sympathetic to all walks of life gets an

466
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:41,430
equal vote. One person could
be a total racist. You could,

467
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,410
you could go to a voting booth with a
tee shirt on that says fuck black people

468
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:49,980
and you could vote and no one could
stop you. You know, as long as you,

469
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:50,900
especially if you have a shirt,

470
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,570
sort of like a flannel shirt that's over
the t shirt that says fuck black people.

471
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,940
So you have to really look hard to see
fuck black people and you think you're

472
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,910
getting over. No one can
stop you. You know? And it's,

473
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,380
I think one of the things that they
were trying to work around when they

474
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:07,820
developed the concept of a
representative democracy there,

475
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:11,010
the concept of America representative
government. So like, okay,

476
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:14,100
let's sort of have some filters
in place when you're voting,

477
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,590
but you're kind of voting
on a representative and
the representative sort of

478
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:17,160
votes

479
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,900
and they interpret what you want.
I think that's,

480
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,470
that's definitely part of the idea.
I think that when you, I mean that,

481
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,840
that point you just made about the,

482
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,780
it really reminds me actually the racist
point you mentioned made there was a

483
00:28:27,781 --> 00:28:32,010
really effective commercial for rock
the vote. I remember years ago in the,

484
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:36,240
in the UK when I was back
there at the time and they,

485
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,130
they literally had a some image of,
I wasn't images like uh,

486
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,500
a TV ad of a ray of the racist guy,

487
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:47,590
like spewing racist
stuff. And then the, the,

488
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:51,870
the tagline for the ad was you'd better
vote cause you can be sure that he will.

489
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,990
And it was a really, you know,
good way of making that point.

490
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:58,900
But I think that generally, you know,
those kind of people, are they extreme?

491
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,050
I think the idea is that most
people are not, you know,

492
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:08,770
the kind of extreme end
of it where they're either
totally and where their views

493
00:29:08,771 --> 00:29:13,680
are just completely abhorrent or they
are just completely off the page in terms

494
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:15,560
of their knowledge. You got, you know,

495
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,010
majority of people who are basically
interested in good things happening.

496
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,570
I think the problem is they just
don't know enough about it. They're,

497
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,780
the information they get is
not interesting. It's not
presented in a good way.

498
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,810
There's other interesting things going on.
They're busy with their life, you know,

499
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,760
they want to get involved.
And so what happens,

500
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,050
and I think this is
happening more and more,

501
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:38,820
is you end up with a smaller and smaller
group of people who basically control

502
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:42,040
the political system because the,
the massive

503
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,110
people are just not interested.
They're turned off.

504
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,540
They think that getting involved,
what make any difference.

505
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,370
And so what you end up with is people
with a lot of money, special interests,

506
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,241
those who,
you know,

507
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:56,140
that kind of professionals of the
political game running everything.

508
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,460
And that actually makes people even less
inclined to get involved because they

509
00:30:00,461 --> 00:30:04,630
see what's happening thing. Oh, well why
should I bother? It's a really bad cycle,

510
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:08,050
I think. Yeah. And then people
start saying things like,

511
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,870
all the new world order's
and control anyway,

512
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:14,860
the Bilderberg group is in control anyway.
And there was some,

513
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,600
a thing yesterday that was in
the news where one of the, uh,

514
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,460
members of the Bilderberg Group, uh, in,

515
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,070
I think he used some Dutch guy,

516
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,730
had some impromptu public discussion
with all these people and they start

517
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:32,260
bringing out all these details
of nine, 11, nine, 11, those,

518
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,890
the building was brought down thermite
and they stay and they circled this guy

519
00:30:35,891 --> 00:30:39,190
and started talking to them. And it's,
it's kind of fascinating, you know, this,

520
00:30:39,191 --> 00:30:41,680
this idea of the Illuminati,
the,

521
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:46,510
this idea of a small group of people
controlling everyone through iconic

522
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,510
symbolism,

523
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,030
eyeballs inside of pyramids
and all that stuff becomes a,

524
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,690
in a lot of ways, a vehicle for, um,

525
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,420
for feeling unempowered that we're
feeling. That's existing franchised.

526
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:04,300
That's what's good. I think that's,
that, that's how people feel.

527
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,490
I certainly noticed,

528
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,520
I used to work back in the UK and the
government and I noticed it that I've been

529
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:13,330
in politics a long time. That's how
people feel that it's even more so here.

530
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,231
I think,
you know,

531
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:17,710
if you just look today with speaking
on election day in California's the

532
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:21,330
primaries, everyone's saying it's going
to be the lowest turnout ever known,

533
00:31:21,331 --> 00:31:24,040
was interested because they don't
think it makes any difference.

534
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,650
I think that's a real problem.
And then they feel, you know,

535
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,550
the whole idea of democracies is people
power is that you have the power.

536
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,690
Everyone had,
like you was saying,

537
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:35,350
everyone has the same chance to
influence things and they have the power,

538
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,660
but that is not what it
feels like to people.

539
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,050
And then every now and then
something comes along with it. Like,

540
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:42,340
how the hell did that pass?

541
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,950
And then they freak out
exactly like proposition eight,

542
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,680
where they repealed gay marriage.
And everybody's like,

543
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:51,340
are you fucking kidding me? In
California, you've appealed gay marriage.

544
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,680
The most shocking thing about proposition
eight to me was that over almost over

545
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,750
the, the majority, uh, of,

546
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,100
of black people voted for it.
They voted to my heel.

547
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,960
Gay Marriage. They didn't want
gay marriage, which is, you know,

548
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:11,680
quite hilarious if you started thinking
about people that have been persecuted,

549
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,250
I mean,

550
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,250
who has been a victim of
unfair discrimination in
this country more than black

551
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:21,520
people probably know.
I don't know because um,

552
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,330
I wasn't involved in any way, but I've
heard that when you look at the date,

553
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:27,790
exactly to your point,
that that was one of the reasons,

554
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,960
and that was particularly the case
because it was in the ea when Obama was

555
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:34,270
running and you had a high
turnout amongst those people.

556
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,740
Precisely because you have the first black
candidate on the ballot for president.

557
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,400
So had more black people voting

558
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,320
and that was one of the consequences.
Yes,

559
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:47,930
70% I don't know if that's right, but
that's certainly what some have argued.

560
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,140
Do you know how crazy 70% that's the
exit polls said 70% of black people voted

561
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:56,750
for proposition eight.
That's stunning.

562
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,970
The idea being for a lot of them, that
is, it was, it was a religious decision.

563
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,410
Yeah.
I think that was a big,

564
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,340
that was a big part of the story that's
told someone should tap challenge that

565
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,090
and uh,

566
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,930
what they should do is they should
make some sort of a proposition banning

567
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,360
shrimp,
you know,

568
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,400
like have like have like these big
signs in front of Red Lobster, you know,

569
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,730
with genesis, like whatever, whatever
the quote in the Bible that says your,

570
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,220
because there's four times as many
references to shellfish as there is to gay

571
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:29,510
people.
It was like,

572
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:32,840
this isn't like a lot of references to
like you're not supposed to eat shrimp,

573
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,260
but you can go to an all unique
buffet and people right after church.

574
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,910
That's really how we allow it. You're
right, it needs to be stopped. It's bad,

575
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,640
but they can't,
for whatever reason,

576
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,620
the gay thing like really locked on to
people. Like they really got into it.

577
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,030
They really got into it for whatever
reason, you know, the, the gay,

578
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,320
the gay decision,

579
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,730
the decision to stop gay marriage seemed
to be like a one that Jesus was really

580
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:03,230
serious about that shrimp thing. Then
pick a tooth, pick and choose, you know,

581
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,930
you're not supposed to get tattooed
how many religious people have crosses

582
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:09,840
tattooed on their body. I mean, that's
a fucking, that's like directly, no,

583
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:13,340
I didn't know that. Oh yeah.
Tattoos not, yeah. Upon, yeah.

584
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:14,890
You're not supposed to mark yourself.
Okay.

585
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,740
You're not supposed to tattoo yourself.
That's, that's against God's wish.

586
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,270
But people will tattoo themselves with
biblical verses, which is, you know,

587
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,100
hilarious. Yeah. Well
people are weird. You know,

588
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:33,101
and my point that I was trying to make
kind of clumsily earlier was that it's

589
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:40,210
kind of strange that we are so varied
and it's kind of strange that everyone

590
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:46,400
does get, like if there's three
of us in a room, you know, we,

591
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:51,170
we have to, we all have to all decide.
And uh, if one of us is retarded,

592
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,790
I mean,
not literally,

593
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,930
but are people with down syndrome or
people that are anyone that has like

594
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,170
mentally compromised? Are they
allowed to vote? I mean, there's,

595
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:03,830
there's some sort of a test if you apply
that. I didn't know what the rules are.

596
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,610
I think in, in the, in the, in
Britain, it was something to do with,

597
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,320
I think the only thing was if you
in jail, I can't remember. Well,

598
00:35:12,321 --> 00:35:15,590
if you're a felon in America,
we don't ever let you recover.

599
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,680
We don't ever let you recover from that.
So if you're a felon,

600
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:23,060
you don't get to vote. Yeah. You fucked
up too much. What? You never can. No,

601
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,830
I don't believe so.
Fell.

602
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:30,710
I'm pretty sure it felons don't get to
vote because Joey Diaz always talks about

603
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:35,240
that. Don't get to vote. I
know they can't carry firearms.

604
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,130
Yeah.
State felon laws.

605
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,430
Um, I guess it looks like
it's different in every state.

606
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,820
Two states allow felons
to vote from prison,

607
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:49,821
while other states may permanently prevent
felons from voting even after being

608
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:54,090
released. So it's different. It varies
from state to state. It's amazing.

609
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,470
Permanently prevent. Yeah.
They lose, uh, they vote.

610
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:03,150
They cannot vote permanently.
In 11 states. Uh, Alabama,

611
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,440
Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Iowa,

612
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,880
Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada,

613
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,400
Tennessee.
W coincidentally,

614
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:19,390
all places I would never
fucking live. How Weird, Huh?

615
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,030
Yeah. You're worried about
the rules? I think the, um,

616
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,850
that is amazing to me that there's

617
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,350
this assumption that there's no
chance you get on can I cut back?

618
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,270
You don't turn it around.
You never make a felony when you're 18.

619
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,510
Like some stupid thing.
You go to jail,

620
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,400
you come out and become like the best
person ever and they're never going to let

621
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:42,780
you return.
It's ridiculous.

622
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,780
I mean the whole point of what you try
and do with the criminal justice system

623
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:50,490
and so on is to try and exactly,
you know,

624
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,910
rehabilitate people so they don't
offend again. I mean that is,

625
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,320
and try and get people to that point.
Yeah.

626
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:59,850
I think people were just so tired of
people just fucking up that they're like,

627
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:03,810
you know what? This is a good way to
keep fuck ups from voting. Like once,

628
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:06,450
like the idea that we were talking
about earlier that, you know,

629
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:08,170
a person could be a racist,

630
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:13,171
the person could be a complete nutter
and still vote along with a person who's

631
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,640
really kind and educated and
their vote counts equally.

632
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:21,900
They're in a community that as soon as
that nutter, rob something, it goes,

633
00:37:21,901 --> 00:37:24,600
it's a good way to cut them out of
the system. All right, fuck that guy.

634
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:28,050
You can't vote anymore.
Which I cast kind of makes sense,

635
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:32,550
but maybe it's just a numbers thing.
If there's 10 people on an island,

636
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:35,580
we would have to rehabilitate. The guy
was told the coconuts, we'd have to say,

637
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:37,720
come on, man, you can't be
stealing everybody's coconuts.

638
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:40,050
This is a fucked up way to live your life.
If you should contribute,

639
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,400
stop stealing fish,

640
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:45,300
stop stealing coconuts getting together
and then we'd let that guy be a part of

641
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:46,160
the case.
By the way,

642
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,310
I think it's an incredibly important
point about about democracy generally.

643
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:54,390
I think the closer it is to a real
community where everyone knows each other,

644
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,021
right?

645
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:59,190
Where the decisions are made by people
who can look the other person in the eye

646
00:37:59,191 --> 00:38:00,870
and well that I think
they're going to be better.

647
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:03,270
I think one of the problems
is that you've got these big,

648
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:08,100
big systems and that kind of really far
from the human level where that kind of

649
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:13,101
trust can be established and that is one
of the problems with a lot of things in

650
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,670
government and politics. It's all just
too big and removed from that human scale.

651
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,890
Well that's a problem with a lot of
things when it comes to human beings.

652
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:25,890
Just diffusion of responsibility that
comes with being a part of a massive group

653
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,710
like war.
Yeah.

654
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:32,730
The idea that if there's 300 million
of us and a million of us or overseas,

655
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,730
you know, fighting for freedom, uh,

656
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,730
that's sort of like you could deal
with that because it's not happening in

657
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:41,140
Calabasas. You know, you can,

658
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:44,530
you could go to work and you get
deal with your life and in your,

659
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,560
the scope of your world,
it doesn't come up.

660
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,490
But you kind of peripherally aware
at this is happening somewhere else.

661
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,410
But if people in Van Nuys,

662
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:57,010
we're going to war with people in studio
city and it was only a couple miles

663
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:58,480
away and you had to deal with that,

664
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,810
then it would be something we
would have to try to calm down.

665
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,780
We'd have to try to deal with this. Like
what? What the fuck's going on here?

666
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:06,730
Like what are we doing
here? We'd have to, it's,

667
00:39:06,731 --> 00:39:08,110
it's something that you have to deal with,

668
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,750
but the sheer number of human beings that
are involved in the world today and in

669
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:15,760
communities and cultures, it's
just, it's almost unmanageable.

670
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,600
It's an unmanageable for a person who's
not designed for that were designed

671
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:22,060
essentially to deal with
our immediate atmosphere.

672
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,900
We're designed to deal with small
tribes of people, friends, family,

673
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:26,861
the people that you know,

674
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:29,500
the people that you keep close
and when you get past that,

675
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,230
it's just like almost like, what do
we, I don't know what to do with this.

676
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,900
And so we pass the buck
off to some representative.

677
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,720
I think this is such an important point.
I really do believe that.

678
00:39:37,721 --> 00:39:42,721
I think that so many things don't work
because they get away from the point

679
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:46,030
where you can really know the other
person or the group that you're with.

680
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,270
There's some guy, and I'm in England,
I think it Cambridge University.

681
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,800
It's in research about the maximum number
of people that you can really have any

682
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:55,850
kind of human relationship
with anyone tiny.

683
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,240
I think he got to a number of 150
Dunbar's number. Is that right?

684
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:00,460
I see more about it than I do.

685
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,820
I thought that was just a really
interesting perspective on it, which is,

686
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:08,770
which is that after that it just gets
to diffuse. We're not designed for it.

687
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:11,770
It's like your phone. Your phone's
only has a certain amount of data.

688
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:14,440
That old fucking goofy flip
phone you carry around with you.

689
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,250
If you have an older one, like when
those Motorola star tax, you know,

690
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:21,520
remember those from back in the day.
Big fucking goofy, clunky thing.

691
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,640
I mean that probably only carried
a hundred phone numbers. I mean,

692
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,770
I dunno how many of that,

693
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,430
but the amount of data that you can store
new devices represents the need that

694
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:31,000
we have.

695
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But we have these same biological
hard drives that cavemen did.

696
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:37,630
I mean,

697
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,810
they're not really much different than
people that lived a million years ago.

698
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,200
I mean, how much of it has it
changed? I mean, how many, how many,

699
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,640
how much more room do we have for social
relationships? Apparently not much.

700
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,280
Like 50,000 years ago.
And today, if you took a,

701
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,020
a guy who lived 50,000 years ago and a
guy who lived today and you compare the

702
00:40:56,021 --> 00:41:00,400
brains, how much would they vary?
You could take a 50,000 year old man,

703
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:05,410
dress him up in clothes and sit them
down in a movie theater and you'd walk

704
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:07,810
right by him. You wouldn't even know
when you're sitting in your seat,

705
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,810
you wouldn't go, Holy Shit,
that's a fucking cave man. I mean,

706
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,700
the guy would look very remarkably
similar to how you look and I look and how

707
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:17,830
normal folks look today.
Yeah.

708
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:20,120
We're not designed for this world
that we've created and it's,

709
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:25,030
it's popped up so damn quick. Yeah,
exactly. It's really the last kind of,

710
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,590
well definitely last a hundred
years, but you know, again,

711
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,290
it's just getting faster and faster.
You know,

712
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:33,870
this kind of everything becoming really
kind of organize it, they sort inhuman

713
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,570
level

714
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:39,570
and this mad struggle to sort of organize
it and to try to control it and just

715
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,670
be, just calm it down, get a
handle on the effects of it.

716
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,830
And I think in a lot of ways that's what
you're doing with this Crowdpac thing

717
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:56,130
with this Crowdpac thing is
you are utilizing these tools,

718
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:59,890
these tools of the internet and this
instant access to information that we have

719
00:41:59,891 --> 00:42:04,891
today to sort of establish a much clearer
sense of where political candidates

720
00:42:06,581 --> 00:42:11,581
are coming from and what
are their influences as far
as who is financing them,

721
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,610
where is,
where is their money coming from,

722
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:18,850
where their decisions headed towards what,
what are they,

723
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,990
what are they doing right now?
No.

724
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,840
Yeah, I think that's, that's
a really good summary of it,

725
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:26,740
which is that basically we think that
when you talk to people about politics,

726
00:42:26,741 --> 00:42:29,530
one of the things they say is that
we just don't know enough about it.

727
00:42:29,531 --> 00:42:33,430
We don't know enough information
generally, but we don't know.

728
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,050
We don't have information we can trust.

729
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,350
We have all this spin and ads and all
the rest of it from the politicians.

730
00:42:38,351 --> 00:42:41,290
We cannot really believe them. There's
all this stuff around on the Internet.

731
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,430
I don't know what to believe.

732
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:47,140
So what we're trying to do is give people
really objective information that they

733
00:42:47,141 --> 00:42:52,141
can rely on to figure out
where the politicians are
on the issues that they care

734
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:57,320
about. And the thing that we found from
our research is that is my, um, uh,

735
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,390
one of my cofounders, Adam, who's
a professor at Stanford, um,

736
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,620
has been working on
this for for many years.

737
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:08,190
And basically what he's shown is that
the best way to predict what a politician

738
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:13,570
will do if they're elected is to look at
where they get their money and to look

739
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:14,740
at also who they give money to.

740
00:43:14,741 --> 00:43:17,980
Cause most politicians also going
to donate to other candidates.

741
00:43:17,981 --> 00:43:21,100
So if you look at all that
campaign finance information,

742
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,900
the money behind this politician that
is going to give you the best guide to

743
00:43:25,901 --> 00:43:27,790
what they're really going to do in office.

744
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,740
And it's something that you can actually,

745
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:34,570
what we're trying to do is like turn
that into really simple information that

746
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:38,080
you can without kind of reading tons
of stuff and doing loads of research.

747
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:42,490
You can get a quick snapshot of who
these people are and then in time,

748
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:45,940
the other thing that we want to do is
make it possible for you to find the

749
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:48,480
politicians that are really,
um,

750
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,300
good or bad on the issues that you
care about and get involved in their

751
00:43:52,301 --> 00:43:55,120
campaigns. Because the other
thing is that you've got a tiny,

752
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:58,720
tiny number of people who
are funding these campaigns.

753
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:02,350
If you look at the total number of
people who put money into politics,

754
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,830
it's a really small number compared to
the number of people who've who vote.

755
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:07,990
And then the number of
adults in the whole country.

756
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,290
It's a tiny number that are funding
it all. And even within that,

757
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:15,430
most of the money comes from an even
smaller number and they're paying for all

758
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:18,970
of this and they're getting
the outcomes that they pay for.

759
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,620
It's basically a transaction.

760
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,630
That's what's really crazy
and so some people say, right,

761
00:44:25,631 --> 00:44:27,280
you've got to get money out of politics.

762
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,400
That's just got to get it
out and obviously that is
something that has a lot of

763
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:34,530
appeal.
You can see why you'd want to do that.

764
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:36,060
There's a brilliant guy
called Larry Lessig.

765
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,450
I don't know if you've come across what
he's been doing and he's been arguing

766
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:42,180
about this for years and he's
been saying he's at Harvard.

767
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,350
Harvard is that he's a brilliant campaign
on this issue of money in politics.

768
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,270
And he's been saying,

769
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:52,980
if you think about any problem in,
in America today,

770
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,990
whatever the issue is that you care about,

771
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,200
if that's gay marriage or the environment,
or it doesn't matter what it is,

772
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,280
you're not going to get anywhere about
in terms of solving that problem unless

773
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:03,540
you deal with the first problem,

774
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:07,770
which is the money because the money in
politics stops the proper solutions from

775
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:08,311
being developed.

776
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:11,730
Because what it means is that
you've got these special interests,

777
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,080
whether that's left or right,

778
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:15,450
it doesn't matter whether it's big
businesses or unions, doesn't matter.

779
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,780
They want their particular outcome and
they're buying it through the system.

780
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,280
So we've got to get the money out and
he's got a campaign around that and he

781
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:28,281
wants public funding for elections and
so on and all that is kind of a noble

782
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:30,151
aim,
I guess.

783
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:34,950
But my feeling is that that's a
really hard sell because you've got a

784
00:45:34,951 --> 00:45:37,320
constitution that says it's free speech.

785
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:41,220
You're allowed to give money
to politicians, and we can't
just kind of stop that.

786
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,680
Um, you've got to let people
donate to politicians.

787
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:48,540
And so our take on it is to say,
well, if you can't take the money out,

788
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,990
let's at least dilute the influence of
the people there right now by letting

789
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:54,841
more people,

790
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:58,890
making it easier for more people to
get involved and give money to these

791
00:45:58,891 --> 00:45:59,251
candidates.

792
00:45:59,251 --> 00:46:03,720
So they are not dependent on these big
donors with their particular interest.

793
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:07,470
And that's really what we're trying to
do is kind of make it easier for people

794
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:11,090
to get involved in politics so
that they can really, you know,

795
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,540
get these politicians off this
hook there on, which is that their,

796
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:18,000
their dependence on these donors
for their campaign spending,

797
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,980
which means that once they're elected,

798
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,670
it's kind of inevitable that they pay
attention to them rather than the people

799
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:24,504
who elected them

800
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:24,970
in Illinois.

801
00:46:24,970 --> 00:46:29,650
A lot of ways it mirrors the influence
that the Internet has had on the news

802
00:46:29,651 --> 00:46:34,600
itself because the news used to be
distributed only through these proper

803
00:46:34,601 --> 00:46:39,160
channels, whether it was NBC, CBS, and
then, you know, the cable news networks,

804
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,050
CNN,
Fox and all this jazz.

805
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:46,740
But now it's become this
thing where websites develop.

806
00:46:46,991 --> 00:46:50,080
Huffington Post, all
these, uh, young Turks,

807
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:55,081
which is an internet based new
show and they have no censorship,

808
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,220
they have no restrictions,

809
00:46:57,221 --> 00:47:01,630
they have no influence other than the
ones that they choose to accept or the

810
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:06,400
ideas that they bring and they have
the same amount of distribution that

811
00:47:06,401 --> 00:47:11,170
everybody else does. And you can
have a website just, you know,

812
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:14,560
Mike's fuckhead.com and put it up.

813
00:47:14,561 --> 00:47:17,170
And if enough people find
it valid and interesting,

814
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,050
he could have a million hits a day,
unique visits a day.

815
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:22,420
And it might be more than CNN gets.

816
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,860
And just simply because of the fact that
it's good information. It's, well, you've

817
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,950
shown that with this, I mean, you
know, you're reaching more people

818
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,750
than the most of these, I think
all of these news sites, right?

819
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,650
10 and a half million a month, like more
than just about anything else, you know.

820
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:40,960
So it's crazy as exponentially
doubling and tripling.

821
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,500
And what's happening is it's all
being done with no promotion. No,

822
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:48,970
the only promotion is like I let people
know, hey, Steve Hilton's on today.

823
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,730
And then, but just from, yeah,

824
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:56,380
I mean that's good to hear that from
Twitter and just spreading the word.

825
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,740
But what I was getting at is that like
the same way the Internet has sort of

826
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,720
interfered with the
distribution of information.

827
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,560
Look at what's going on with his Edward
Snowden case is a perfect example.

828
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,590
This massive change in the way the
entire country looks at the NSA and

829
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:21,121
government spying was done by one man
leaking information to one guy and one

830
00:48:23,561 --> 00:48:27,640
source which spread through
the Internet and then boom,

831
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,090
it blossoms is huge news story.
That was essentially,

832
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,540
if he had sent that same story through
the proper channels to like the New York

833
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:37,840
Times or CNN,
they would have nord the fuck out of it.

834
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:41,770
They would have figured out a way to cover
that thing and throw it under the rug

835
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:44,650
and stable that rug down
and light it on fire.

836
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:49,860
I mean what he did was figure out a
way to distribute things for this and

837
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,940
through this new channel and essentially
that's what the Internet is doing with

838
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:58,870
with voting. Before something
like the Internet came along,

839
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:02,080
it was very difficult to find out who
the influences of all these different

840
00:49:02,081 --> 00:49:06,880
individual candidates where with something
like Crowdpac it becomes much more

841
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:11,881
easy and that also will change the
way these people interact with,

842
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:16,000
you know, I really hope
that that is, you know,

843
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:17,980
we're just at the stumps of
it to be honest. I think the,

844
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,030
the political world is really late
for this kind of change compared to,

845
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:26,000
like you say with media and other things
and things that we experience every day

846
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,280
in our lives. Like you
know, like travel booking,

847
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:31,290
you know that they used to be a time when,
you know,

848
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:35,710
to get an airline ticket you that's is
have a physically go to some shop and

849
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,170
then have these like weird paper to,
you know,

850
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:40,330
the whole thing just feels so
antiquated and now it's so simple.

851
00:49:40,331 --> 00:49:43,420
It's really light. You were saying
you've got the power to do it,

852
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:45,550
you're empowered now.
You get it on your phone.

853
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:46,690
You don't even have to have a ticket.

854
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,640
And that's got a phone
over the scanner thing.

855
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,830
That hasn't really
happened to politics yet.

856
00:49:50,831 --> 00:49:53,890
But that is what we're trying to
do because, and all this as well.

857
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:57,430
It's not just us, but you know, I think
that we've got something interesting here,

858
00:49:57,431 --> 00:50:01,750
which is this way of giving people
objective information about the candidates

859
00:50:01,751 --> 00:50:03,820
based on who gives them money.
But,

860
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,860
but overall we're part of this movement
of trying to really put power in

861
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:12,880
people's hands through technology.
And I'm sure it's going to happen.

862
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,790
I'm really sure because people want it,
you know,

863
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:20,770
they all sick of just feeling that they
don't get any response and these people

864
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:23,950
have a had control everything
and nothing ever really changes.

865
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,500
And actually the politicians themselves,
in my experience, they, you know,

866
00:50:27,501 --> 00:50:28,070
you'd think,

867
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,850
well maybe I would say this cause I
used to work in politics myself for the

868
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:33,680
prime minister in the UK.
So I kind of know them.

869
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:37,400
They kind of used to be my
world that used to be my world.

870
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:42,380
My feeling is that generally
the politicians actually
hate this just as much as

871
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:43,040
everyone else.

872
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,940
They hate the fact that they have to spend
so much time raising money. You know,

873
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:52,430
literally there was this document
that was leaked to the New York Times,

874
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:57,431
I think a while back from the democratic
leadership in Congress where they gave

875
00:50:58,161 --> 00:51:02,750
a kind of guide to the newly elected
members of Congress about how they should

876
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:03,680
spend their time.

877
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,290
And it was a recommendation to the newly
elected members of Congress and it went

878
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:09,830
through how much,

879
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,400
how many hours a day they should spend
with different types of activity.

880
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:17,470
You know, thinking about policy, talking
to constituents, there's going to be,

881
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,620
half of the time it was four hours
was recommended that they spend on

882
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:25,950
fundraising. Wow. Right. And so
the people who go into policy,

883
00:51:25,951 --> 00:51:29,160
they don't want to live like that. They
actually hate it. They hate, you know,

884
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:32,060
being shoved in a room with
is what happens and being,

885
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:33,560
they call it dialing for dollars,
you know,

886
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:36,890
like just literally sitting on
the phone trying to raise money.

887
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,230
That's not why they went into politics.
How do they do that?

888
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:42,620
They just call random people up or do
they have the list of potential donors

889
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,370
give? I don't know cause I've
never done it, but I think they,

890
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,870
I think that's literally it.
They're given less of likely people to

891
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,080
d Dee Dee Dee Dee,
hi,

892
00:51:52,081 --> 00:51:55,590
I'm running for Congress in the 33rd
district and now I'd like to get gay

893
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:57,840
marriage the fuck Outta here.
What do you think? I think

894
00:51:58,410 --> 00:51:59,640
I'm pretty much like that.

895
00:51:59,641 --> 00:52:03,270
I don't know how to talk to some people
who know more about it, but um, you know,

896
00:52:03,271 --> 00:52:03,570
so,

897
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:08,570
so I think actually the politicians
themselves and mostly hate the system.

898
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:13,200
And so I think that, um,
you know, in a lot of,

899
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:18,060
there's a lot of effort actually in
Congress to try and encourage more small

900
00:52:18,061 --> 00:52:21,450
donors and make it easier for people to
give money because actually that that's

901
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:22,284
what they want to,

902
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,780
they don't like being beholden to these
big donors and these companies and you

903
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,260
know, they don't like it
any more than we like it.

904
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,660
I think ultimately the idea of leaders,

905
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:36,190
whether it's presidential leaders
or whether it's a representatives,

906
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:39,000
I think ultimately that's
going to go away. And My,

907
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:44,020
my thought about it is that anybody who
really wants to lead everyone else is

908
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:48,550
probably an asshole. You know? I mean,
anybody who really wants to be the king,

909
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,180
like why do you want to be the king?
Like don't you have things to do?

910
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:55,940
Don't you have hobbies and
creative pursuits and like what,

911
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,100
why would you want to just be the guy
who gets to control be the one who stands

912
00:53:00,101 --> 00:53:04,930
at the podium, ladies and gentlemen. You
know, that's, that's a weird ego thing.

913
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:10,160
I think that in 2014 in the world that
we live in today where we're seeing this

914
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,080
much more even distribution of influence.
Yeah.

915
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,270
I think that ultimately that's going to
be one of those things that gets called

916
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:22,660
into question. Like, why do we
have an Alpha representative?

917
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:26,400
Why do we have to have
this head and charge?

918
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:30,550
I really agree with it. I mean, a lot of
the things that I was trying to do, uh,

919
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,820
when I was in the government
in the UK and, and,

920
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,700
and it's kind of part of what we're
doing with Crowdpac is, is you know,

921
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,530
trying to encourage that even distribution
that more even distribution upon

922
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:45,390
redistribute power from that kind
of traditional sources of power.

923
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:46,610
And it's going to central leadership,

924
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:50,070
putting power in people's hands so that
they can control more and more aspects

925
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:53,790
of their life because then the end
they'll make better decisions overall.

926
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,030
And it's also just be more healthy.

927
00:53:57,031 --> 00:54:00,740
I think going back to what we were
saying earlier about, um, you know, the,

928
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,660
the way people can only know
a small number of people and,

929
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:09,170
and if you give them power to shape more
of the things that happened in their

930
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:12,480
lives, I think that that actually
they will take more responsibility.

931
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,210
They'll be more responsible
in a community sense.

932
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:20,160
You'll just see everything get better if
you take power out of the hands of the

933
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:23,250
sort of lead it leaders and central
organizations and put it in the hands of

934
00:54:23,251 --> 00:54:25,740
people. Definitely. I
think, I think you're right.

935
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:28,800
I think there's also an issue
of it being overwhelming.

936
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:31,650
The amount of information that you
have to absorb whenever you deal with

937
00:54:31,651 --> 00:54:34,140
political issues,
whenever you deal with campaigns,

938
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:35,640
whenever you deal with new elections,

939
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:40,140
you know you're given this pamphlet
of different people and the different

940
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,590
propositions that are up for vote
and you just get overwhelmed.

941
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:44,820
Especially if you're,

942
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:49,440
if you have a job that's taxing as it
is and you have a family and you know

943
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:51,000
you're thinking about
golfing on the weekend,

944
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:53,970
God and learned to go golfing and you're
looking all this bullshit and like, oh,

945
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:57,180
I can't even pay attention to this.
Is Everything okay right now? Yes.

946
00:54:57,181 --> 00:55:01,830
Well fucking let me just get this over
with and let's hope everything stays okay.

947
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:07,070
And very few people take
responsibility for what gets voted in.

948
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:12,510
Yeah, and it is, I think you're right
though. It is really target. It's hard.

949
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:17,010
It's easy to say, oh, the voters are lazy
or whatever. They should. But honestly,

950
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,461
like you said,

951
00:55:17,461 --> 00:55:21,060
they've got real lives to live and they
haven't got time for all this stuff.

952
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:24,660
And that is a really big part of why
we want to make it simple. You know,

953
00:55:24,661 --> 00:55:29,661
we are assuming that people want to
spend less time doing this stuff,

954
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:34,500
not more time. And I think
a lot of the kind of, um,

955
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:39,300
organizations and people that have
tried to get people mobilized, you know,

956
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:42,700
civic organization and the kindness,
that kind of thing, you know, it's,

957
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:45,420
it's worked to a certain extent with some
people, but for the majority of people,

958
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:47,670
they just don't want to do it.
They can't do it. Actually.

959
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:52,710
They're literally too busy, um, with
things that are higher priorities,

960
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:55,230
like their kids and their family
and their job or whatever it may be.

961
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:58,830
Hobbies doesn't matter. It's stuff
that they choose to do and that's fine.

962
00:55:58,831 --> 00:55:59,664
That's their life.

963
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,760
And we shouldn't kind of require that
you have to spend ages figuring out this

964
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:08,430
political stuff. And that's
why we're trying to make it
really simple for people,

965
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,970
but based on quite a lot of comp. And
that's what technology allows you to do.

966
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,800
You can take quite a lot of complex data
and information like we're doing with

967
00:56:16,801 --> 00:56:17,940
the campaign finance records,

968
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:22,050
where it's literally hundreds of millions
of pieces of information and we're

969
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:25,480
boiling it down into one
piece of information,

970
00:56:25,481 --> 00:56:28,990
which is a score like where
is this candidate on the,

971
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:31,000
on the scale of liberal to conservative,

972
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,790
where do they sit and where
are they on each issue?

973
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:35,950
That's what we're trying to
do to make it really simple,

974
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,020
isn't it sort of analogous in a
way to what we were talking about,

975
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,620
about the amount of people that you can
keep in your brain that Dunbar's number

976
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,800
is that if you lived in a small tribe,
if safe,

977
00:56:46,801 --> 00:56:50,160
we all live 50 of us together
in some small village somewhere,

978
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:54,840
we really wouldn't have votes about gay
marriage and we really wouldn't have

979
00:56:54,841 --> 00:56:55,674
quotes about,

980
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,310
there'd be a million different things
that would never be up for vote,

981
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:04,050
and if someone really did start micro
managing everyone's lives, he'd be like,

982
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:08,010
Hey, you know, Mike is an asshole. We got
to kick him out of this fucking tribe.

983
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,560
This guy's trying to get people
to wear purple and you know,

984
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:15,120
where certain Nike's during different
moon cycles and make tribal rules and

985
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:19,080
rituals and make all these
things standard. And you
know, for whatever reason,

986
00:57:19,081 --> 00:57:22,530
he doesn't like men sleeping with men.
Like he's got some weird thing, you know,

987
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,393
he believes it's

988
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,340
so true. I just saw agree with that.
One of my favorite things that um,

989
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,870
one of the these experiments
that happened was in Holland.

990
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:35,020
I think I've got that right.
Um, in, in, in Europe.

991
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,070
And they did this brilliant experiment
with traffic where they, um,

992
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:43,060
in a town, I think it was
Friesland or something like that,

993
00:57:43,061 --> 00:57:44,710
probably got that wrong.
Um,

994
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,300
where they literally took away all the
traffic signals, all of them, everything,

995
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:53,800
right? They took away traffic lights,
they even took it, you know, stop signs,

996
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:56,200
everything, even the,
the markings on the road.

997
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:59,080
So they took away the white line in the
middle of the road, everything all gone.

998
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,680
And their theory was that without that
kind of external rule making and kind of

999
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:08,650
stuff going on to tell you what to do,

1000
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,360
people would have to kind of relate
to each other as other people and just

1001
00:58:13,361 --> 00:58:18,040
figure it out amongst themselves.
So they would, um, you know,

1002
00:58:18,050 --> 00:58:22,330
have to look other people in the eye and,
and sort of work it out between them.

1003
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,810
And they found they had this
brilliant effect, which was that um,

1004
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,590
accidents fell to zero.
The traffic improve,

1005
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,460
the traffic speed was lower,
but the traffic flow was much better.

1006
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,320
It just worked all around,

1007
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:38,980
all the kinds of things that you try and
do when all these people thinking about

1008
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:40,720
traffic planning and whatever,

1009
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:44,350
they achieved all those aims by
literally taking everything away and just

1010
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:48,510
allowing people to relate to each
other as humans and earth rules.

1011
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:53,610
I thought it was such a great little story
and I think that you could do that in

1012
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:54,940
all sorts of areas.

1013
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,300
If you just leave it to people to figure
it out on a small scale where they can

1014
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,760
relate to each other,
you just get a much better result.

1015
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:04,810
Isn't that the issue though?
The small scale we're dealing with,

1016
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,340
I drove here today.

1017
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,690
I live about 20 minutes from here and
in the drive from my house to here,

1018
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:14,080
I didn't know anybody.
I don't know any of those fucking people.

1019
00:59:14,081 --> 00:59:15,280
They might not even be real.

1020
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:19,480
They might be robots that were sent from
the government to pretend the MSA again,

1021
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:23,810
Haley, and he would maybe even
the, I don't know them, you know?

1022
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,510
So there there's, there's,
there's that issue,

1023
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,080
whereas everyone in Friesland or wherever
the fuck that place was in Holland,

1024
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,710
those, those people probably all know
each other. You know, it's a small area.

1025
00:59:33,711 --> 00:59:36,680
There's not a lot.
When you get to some weird number,

1026
00:59:36,681 --> 00:59:40,520
like the 20 million people that are
live in the greater Los Angeles area,

1027
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,250
that's too crazy.
It's too,

1028
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:47,300
it's too nutty and there's
nothing less human than a light.

1029
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,630
A stop light.
Red Means Stop.

1030
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,520
Green means go wait, look
at it. It's green. Go.

1031
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,240
I mean,

1032
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,240
it's so disconnected from
human interaction and without
it we become crippled.

1033
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:08,430
There's no better chance that you're
going to run into a traffic stop or a

1034
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,160
traffic jam. Then if a cop is
directing, if there's a cop,

1035
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:16,820
it's standing there telling you people go
forward, then you people stop. For sure.

1036
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:19,670
That guy's fucking,
that intersection up sideways.

1037
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:23,450
Every time I go into one
of those situations where a
light is down and there's a

1038
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:28,040
cop standing there, it's a fucking
disaster. Whereas if it was just a light,

1039
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,930
if just red light,
green light,

1040
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:33,490
everything seems to work cause we're sort
of program to wait for that light and

1041
01:00:33,491 --> 01:00:36,740
then go to it. You just, yeah, you can
follow that up. That cop is, they're like,

1042
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:40,130
oh this mother fucker. I look at
it, no wonder this thing's a mess.

1043
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:43,860
It's a person out there telling
us when we can go fuck him.

1044
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,810
Who's he asshole fat fuck telling
me when to go and you know,

1045
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:51,980
and there's this weirdness involved and
all of a sudden there's a human element

1046
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:55,490
that's been thrown into
our robot light thing.

1047
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,310
And then there's a,
you know,

1048
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,010
there's cameras that they were
putting on them for a while,

1049
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,240
which were hilarious on the
actual cups. No, no, no, no.

1050
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:07,790
On the lights because they are doing
that too. I think on the cops. Yeah,

1051
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:11,480
they should. They should do that on all
cops because she'd do that on all cops.

1052
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:15,200
Everything a cop does all throughout the
day should be recorded and it should be

1053
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:17,490
untamperable though they shots that.

1054
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:21,250
I genuinely think that's what they're
trying to do. So much abuse. It's,

1055
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,950
there's just massive amounts of abuse
when it comes to police officers.

1056
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,990
And I think there's a lot
of great cops out there.

1057
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,300
There's not that I don't
believe in law enforcement,

1058
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:33,050
but I believe many of them are
abusive fucks and many of them are

1059
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:38,051
psychologically unable to deal with the
demands of an incredibly stressful life.

1060
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,720
Yeah, it's really tough. I completely
agree with the way you put it,

1061
01:01:41,721 --> 01:01:44,260
that there's tons of them, the
great, and then the others,

1062
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,140
the totally abused that position.

1063
01:01:46,141 --> 01:01:49,820
And that's another really interesting
example of how technology can be really

1064
01:01:49,821 --> 01:01:53,540
helpful, um, in a way, because
you can, you can have the,

1065
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:57,110
I think I got told that they're
trying to do in here the LAPD,

1066
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,490
that if you put the cameras on and
you can't mess around with them,

1067
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,240
that's a really powerful
incentive. Huge to behave. Right.

1068
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:09,830
Complaints have dropped dramatically and
they've dropped dramatically cause cops

1069
01:02:09,831 --> 01:02:12,800
can't be contained anymore. I mean
it's really that simple. It's really,

1070
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,000
it really is that simple.

1071
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,780
What I was talking about was that
at traffic traffic lights, right.

1072
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:17,720
They were having lights.

1073
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:21,330
Like if you were going through the light
as it was yellow and it turned red,

1074
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:24,960
they would flash. So if your
wheels, we're not, you know, it was,

1075
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,250
if they were in front of the line,

1076
01:02:26,251 --> 01:02:28,290
you hadn't made it across
before the light turned red.

1077
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,260
They would give you a ticket and,

1078
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,690
but it would turn out to be a private
company that was actually profiting from

1079
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:34,524
these tickets.

1080
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,650
And so they deemed that unconstitutional
and they were removed all those lights.

1081
01:02:37,651 --> 01:02:42,540
But people were just in a goddamn uproar.
It was just madness. Everywhere you go,

1082
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:47,160
they're taking, you'd see flashes
going off at traffic lights and all,

1083
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:48,210
it was his revenue.

1084
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,990
It wasn't preventing people from running
lights are preventing people from,

1085
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:54,390
you know,
gunning it when the light turns yellow.

1086
01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:57,180
It was just just fucking
people out of their money.

1087
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,950
And it was just one more thing where they
complicate the system for the add one

1088
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:05,340
more element that makes it one more
thing that you have to think about.

1089
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:10,080
One more little piece of control
and one more dehumanizing aspect.

1090
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:14,580
People like freedom and one of the
reasons why people like freedom is because

1091
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,360
freedom isn't just the
freedom to do as you wish.

1092
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,260
It's the freedom to not have to think
about a bunch of other shit and be

1093
01:03:22,261 --> 01:03:26,730
influenced by a bunch of other shit
that takes your time away and takes your

1094
01:03:26,731 --> 01:03:27,564
energy away.

1095
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,670
And I think that's where we're at when
it comes to a lot of these propositions

1096
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:37,671
and a lot of these really Uber complicated
things that are involved in our day

1097
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:39,623
to day lives.

1098
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,630
It's like we've complicated ourselves
to this point of almost of no return and

1099
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:49,050
where there's very few,
very few

1100
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,360
Turnitin.
Yeah.

1101
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:56,090
I think that the thing that happens
then is that they've complicated it,

1102
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:59,060
then it's not working and here's
how we can better try and fix it.

1103
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,880
And then the fixing of it makes it even
more complicated and it just gets that.

1104
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,870
And then a new government comes in or
a new governor or whoever it may be.

1105
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,720
And instead of actually just stopping
and thinking, you know what, this whole,

1106
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:13,260
we just got to rethink the whole
thing and start from scratch and um,

1107
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:17,210
and just not tinker with it anymore and
try and improve it because it's just

1108
01:04:17,211 --> 01:04:19,730
going to make it more complicated.
That never happens.

1109
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:22,660
There's never really enough time for
that to happen. They're not there.

1110
01:04:22,661 --> 01:04:25,220
They were only thinking about the next
couple of years in the next election or

1111
01:04:25,221 --> 01:04:25,940
whatever.

1112
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:30,640
And so things just get even
more complicated and they never,

1113
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,250
they never seem to get to
that point weapon. Yeah,
that's really working. Great.

1114
01:04:34,251 --> 01:04:38,270
Now my wife and I went out
to this restaurant the other
night and the restaurant

1115
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:41,720
was this, we were noticing that there's
this theme that's going on and a lot of

1116
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:46,340
restaurants where they have like this
rustic thing going on where they have old

1117
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,690
school lights,
the filaments in them.

1118
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:53,550
Then they have hardwood tables and
rot iron this and metal that. And,

1119
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,551
and I was like,

1120
01:04:54,551 --> 01:04:59,551
I think people are sort of reacting to
this fabricated world that we've created

1121
01:04:59,711 --> 01:05:04,710
and we long for this simplicity. That's
why there's these shows like, um,

1122
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:09,760
these Alaska shows where people living
on the frontier and they're fucking

1123
01:05:09,761 --> 01:05:11,860
collecting wood and fighting off wolves.

1124
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:17,080
It's like we almost long for that
simplicity of above this world.

1125
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,860
We've complicated to this
almost unmanageable point.

1126
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,740
Yeah, it's definitely true. And
you see and in so many errors that,

1127
01:05:24,741 --> 01:05:25,970
I mean it's like food is a,

1128
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:29,420
is a great example where there's all
this kind of stuff about organic food and

1129
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:32,120
seasonal and local and
grow in your garden.

1130
01:05:32,121 --> 01:05:33,680
And that whole movement
I think is a reaction.

1131
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:37,880
I mean if you think about food like years
ago, like in the 50s, I think, you know,

1132
01:05:37,881 --> 01:05:41,460
it was all about um, you
know, let's have, you know,

1133
01:05:41,461 --> 01:05:43,220
those are the kind of TV package,

1134
01:05:43,221 --> 01:05:47,990
food and all this kind of industrialized
food that was then seen as better

1135
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:52,430
because it was scientific and hygienic
and like really kind of good for you.

1136
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:55,670
And then people are now just thinking
that it's just really horrible.

1137
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,290
This is all the chemicals.
It's disgusting.

1138
01:05:57,291 --> 01:06:01,340
Now the movement is all for this
kind of, uh, local organic food.

1139
01:06:01,341 --> 01:06:06,341
It made me laugh though because my family
from Hungary and so when I was a kid,

1140
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:08,840
we used to go back to
Hungary the whole time.

1141
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,430
It was a communist country and there
were no food stores with loads of choice

1142
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:16,820
and everything. And you would go in the
store and it was just, you know what?

1143
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:21,140
You got just a few sort of vegetables
and it was, it was just very basic. Um,

1144
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:22,303
and now,

1145
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:25,610
but the other day walking around in
San Francisco and there's the kind of

1146
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:29,030
farmer's market thing going on and they
had their kind of ugly vegetables and

1147
01:06:29,031 --> 01:06:33,990
whatever put out there and it just looked
exactly like the Hungarian communist,

1148
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:37,760
the food shop. But here in San Francisco,
it's the most expensive, fancy,

1149
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:41,510
amazing food that you can get. But
it just makes me laugh. Really. It's,

1150
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:43,970
I think a lot of it is
just, you know, you know,

1151
01:06:43,971 --> 01:06:46,450
a reaction to what's gone
before and we're currently,

1152
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,760
I think you're totally right in this
kind of sense of he's just gone too far.

1153
01:06:49,761 --> 01:06:54,560
The whole, um, industrialization of so
many different aspects of our lives. Well,

1154
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,740
it's also, we're starting to realize
where people live in cities and they,

1155
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,630
they look around and they see all these
buildings and they see this asphalt and

1156
01:07:02,631 --> 01:07:06,950
they see these telephone poles
and they go, there's no food here.

1157
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,800
We have to bring in the food.
Like this is kind of crazy. Like,

1158
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,640
and then you'd get on top of a building
and you look around and how far the no

1159
01:07:13,641 --> 01:07:17,120
food here area is.
It's pretty God damn big.

1160
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:21,290
And then you look at all the different
people that live in the no food here area

1161
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:25,160
that require food. He like, fuck,
we got to feed these fucking people.

1162
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:29,090
And then you go, where's this water
coming from? And then you go, oh,

1163
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:30,170
it comes from Colorado.

1164
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:34,430
What's the water comes from fucking
what it's comes from the Colorado River.

1165
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:35,870
Oh No.

1166
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,920
So the only way we get water in California
is we have to take it from thousands

1167
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:44,060
of way, thousands of miles away. That's
the only, this is a crazy place to be.

1168
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:45,160
Like we w,
W,

1169
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:49,750
W we're in this unsustainable environment
and New People move here every day.

1170
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:54,830
New thousand people every day. Bump,
bump, bump, set up a fucking house,

1171
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:57,140
built this, another structure, boom.

1172
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,590
And then we slowly push
out our no food here,

1173
01:08:00,591 --> 01:08:05,120
area deeper and deeper into the desert.
And you know,

1174
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:10,070
no one's thinking about where this
goes. And so far so good, sustainable,

1175
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:12,380
go to the farmer's market.
You can get plenty of good groceries,

1176
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:15,800
but very bizarre if
there's somehow another,

1177
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:19,100
some cutoff of our oil supply,
some,

1178
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:23,360
some way where we can't travel as
easily anymore. We're in a real rut.

1179
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,460
It's not a good spot.
It's not,

1180
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:31,300
ideally every neighborhood should have
like a couple of acres where it's set up

1181
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,350
where you grow food like that.
W Community Garden.

1182
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:39,730
Totally agree with that. There's
a, there's a brilliant guy. Um,

1183
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,010
I don't know if you come across
and go with Nassim Taleb.

1184
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,940
He wrote this book called the Black Swan,
and he's, he was really, um, he's a,

1185
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,640
he's a mathematician and he was
in the financial markets and,

1186
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,390
and he really kind of predicted the crash
and understood all that and he's just

1187
01:08:52,391 --> 01:08:53,080
great.

1188
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:58,000
And one of his big points is that these
big systems that we've ended up with,

1189
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,930
um, the word he uses our, they'd
completely fragile. They're really,

1190
01:09:01,931 --> 01:09:05,170
they look kind of big
and, and, and uh, solid.

1191
01:09:05,171 --> 01:09:09,610
But actually we're so dependent on
them that it makes us really fragile.

1192
01:09:09,611 --> 01:09:11,590
If they collapse or fall over or whatever,

1193
01:09:11,591 --> 01:09:13,690
whether that's a company
or some government system,

1194
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:19,050
we really screwed because that we're so
dependent and that's really a kind of

1195
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:21,820
fragile situation.
And so that's,

1196
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:24,880
that's definitely one of the reasons I
sort of love what he writes about and

1197
01:09:24,881 --> 01:09:27,850
talks about is that he's arguing for
exactly that kind of thing. You know,

1198
01:09:27,851 --> 01:09:30,490
making sure that companies
don't get too big to fail,

1199
01:09:30,491 --> 01:09:31,660
not just in the financial sector.

1200
01:09:31,661 --> 01:09:34,480
A lot of people have talked about
that with the banks is too big to fail

1201
01:09:34,481 --> 01:09:37,570
argument,
but in every area with the food system.

1202
01:09:37,571 --> 01:09:40,420
And other types of businesses
where we're so dependent.

1203
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:43,570
If something went wrong we, you
know, we couldn't cope with it.

1204
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:46,270
And when you have small distributed,

1205
01:09:46,271 --> 01:09:49,180
it's just like we were talking earlier
about the power of being distributed is

1206
01:09:49,181 --> 01:09:53,500
not just voting power and political power,
its economic power, it's social path.

1207
01:09:53,530 --> 01:09:54,760
Every type of power.

1208
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:59,230
It's just going to be much better for
us if it's distributed more broadly and

1209
01:09:59,231 --> 01:10:01,540
we're a long way from that. It's
actually going in the other direction.

1210
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:07,220
Yeah it's going the other direction
and very few cities are diminishing and

1211
01:10:07,221 --> 01:10:11,780
population. Unless there's something
horribly wrong like Detroit where it,

1212
01:10:11,781 --> 01:10:15,200
if I, have you ever been to
Detroit? Have not. It's fascinating.

1213
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,860
While you were over here in America and
you're, you're enjoying our fine country,

1214
01:10:18,861 --> 01:10:20,570
you should go see our biggest disaster,

1215
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,960
cause Detroit at one point in time was
this economic stronghold for America.

1216
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:31,330
It's where we built Camaro's and Corvettes
and Firebirds and it was this place

1217
01:10:32,421 --> 01:10:37,220
where it was where America
built what it built best,

1218
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:38,750
which is besides buildings,

1219
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:43,790
it's cars in America built cars
and it all fucking fell apart.

1220
01:10:43,791 --> 01:10:47,690
It fell apart when they started moving
jobs to Mexico and all the other

1221
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:51,680
countries, it fell apart when they started
producing shittier and Shittier cars.

1222
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:57,040
And when there was all
sorts of complications with
unions and with a million

1223
01:10:58,431 --> 01:11:02,920
different problems. And then slowly but
surely they started diminishing these,

1224
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,010
these factories. And there's a
really interesting documentary,

1225
01:11:07,011 --> 01:11:10,040
I don't know if you've watched Michael
Moore's first documentary, Roger and me.

1226
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:12,650
Did you ever see that?
Roger and me was all about Flint.

1227
01:11:12,651 --> 01:11:16,920
Michigan was about his hometown where
they closed down these plants and then

1228
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:21,930
these people went into immediate, massive
poverty and it was a huge, huge issue.

1229
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,750
And if you go to Detroit today,

1230
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,290
you could buy a house for
$500 and I'm not bullshitting.

1231
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:33,090
They had houses for sale. I was
there 500 bucks. And it's a mess.

1232
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,020
It's a real mess.
I mean there,

1233
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:39,030
there's in areas where they're trying
to gentrify these areas and they're

1234
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:42,570
building local businesses and they're
trying to, you know, encourage growth.

1235
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,180
And you know what I mean?
If a company wanted to move there,

1236
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:48,750
they have a massive amount of people
that are looking for jobs and cheap land

1237
01:11:48,751 --> 01:11:51,720
and it's a good idea. It's a
good place to start, but very,

1238
01:11:51,721 --> 01:11:54,000
very difficult to
encourage people to do so.

1239
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,510
So Detroit shows how easy
things can fall apart. Yeah.

1240
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:02,460
And there's been a bunch of blogs that
have been created where they've, uh,

1241
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:07,461
websites where they have shown how these
trees and nature are taking over these

1242
01:12:09,181 --> 01:12:12,540
areas that used to be populated
where trees are growing those pills.

1243
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,990
It's amazing. I remember
that now. Yeah. Bears,

1244
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,920
bears are moving into these areas that
used to be at least to have, you know,

1245
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,910
towns and bears are slowly started
moving their way into Detroit and it's

1246
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:26,970
fucking crazy. And he'd
say, yeah, but that's,

1247
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:31,500
that shows you how easily it could
all fall apart. Whereas, you know, 50,

1248
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:34,500
60 years ago, here's some, here's
an image of Jamie just put up,

1249
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:39,000
these are trees that are growing
inside of this abandoned building.

1250
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:40,710
It just growing through the floor.

1251
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:44,190
And eventually they'll make their way
through the roof and the roof will rot.

1252
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:49,191
And it just shows you how easy it is
for nature to reclaim areas that human

1253
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:54,810
beings feel like of, well this is a
city now. Now it's the city for now.

1254
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,370
You know,
it's not a city now.

1255
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,980
It's not permanently a city like
this is trees just go. You ever, um,

1256
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:02,970
go to the airport,
drive down.

1257
01:13:02,971 --> 01:13:07,971
Supolvida there's areas where it's really
old roads in these trees have grown up

1258
01:13:08,221 --> 01:13:12,780
through the sidewalks so bad
that the sidewalks are, you know,

1259
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:14,700
you can't walk on them.
I mean they're,

1260
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:19,620
they're like ramps because the tree has
slowly but surely lifted up the concrete

1261
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:23,240
of the sidewalk and it's
trying to reclaim this area.

1262
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:27,960
They've put this stupid rock
paste over. Yeah. You know,

1263
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,390
I think that's like one of
the best examples of how
easy it could all fall apart

1264
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:37,910
at that point about being dependent
on, on something. Yeah. But it's,

1265
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,460
it's interesting cause you got a lot of,

1266
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,110
and I've loved going around other and
getting to know other American cities.

1267
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:47,100
I mean they, I mean that's a bad example.
You've got some really great cities,

1268
01:13:47,101 --> 01:13:47,460
you know,
the,

1269
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:51,570
that seems to be thriving and working and
that's just really cool places to live

1270
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:54,400
and work. I love Chicago. I thought
it was an amazing car, was fantastic.

1271
01:13:54,401 --> 01:13:56,130
Then you've got huge problem with the,

1272
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:01,230
it's just so interesting how you have
a city that is so great in so many ways

1273
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,300
and that, and they've got this, this,

1274
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:08,340
this sort of pocket of real poverty and
crime and that's been going on for years

1275
01:14:09,871 --> 01:14:12,680
and despite all the other advantages
and they got a lot of, you know,

1276
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:17,050
great economic growth going on there
and so on and people visiting and it's

1277
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:18,680
great,
but they still got this PR,

1278
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:22,790
this entrenched problem with
crime and gun violence and um,

1279
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,270
you know, it's just, it's interesting how,

1280
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,530
how long it takes for some of these
prompts to be worked out. Yeah,

1281
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:32,350
Chicago is a disaster in that sense.
It's a great city,

1282
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:35,500
but it's also a disaster in the
sense of crime and gang violence.

1283
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:36,640
And I was there,

1284
01:14:36,641 --> 01:14:39,430
I was talking to this guy who was a cop
and he was explaining it to me that a

1285
01:14:39,431 --> 01:14:44,431
big problem is the drug trade and that
certain gang members were incarcerated

1286
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:50,020
and because they were incarcerated
they created a vacuum that was,

1287
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,360
there was a power struggle
to try to fill the vacuum.

1288
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:56,800
That power struggle started this sort of
violent war going on between all these

1289
01:14:56,801 --> 01:15:00,880
different criminal factions. And then
you know, it builds up and you know,

1290
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:04,060
he was really kind of interesting
cause he was talking about, he goes,

1291
01:15:04,061 --> 01:15:08,440
you know the best way to fix it,
he goes legalized drugs and he goes,

1292
01:15:08,441 --> 01:15:09,520
nobody wants to hear about it.

1293
01:15:09,521 --> 01:15:12,790
But the reason why they're making all
this money is because they're selling

1294
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:16,330
something that's illegal. And so when
you're selling something that's illegal,

1295
01:15:16,331 --> 01:15:18,970
the only people that are doing that
are the people that are criminals.

1296
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,890
And he goes,
as soon as you make it legal,

1297
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,020
you can deal with a personal choice issue.

1298
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:25,240
And the guy was like very
rational about it and he was like,

1299
01:15:25,241 --> 01:15:27,640
you're dealing with a personal choice
issue instead of a crime issue.

1300
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,050
But I think that's exactly right.

1301
01:15:29,051 --> 01:15:33,400
I think it said one of the more kind of
interesting ways into that whole drug

1302
01:15:33,401 --> 01:15:35,680
legalization argument is,
is to think about the,

1303
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:40,970
the social problems that come from
the current rules. Not just, you know,

1304
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:44,170
a lot of times people talk about the
drug use being the social problem,

1305
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:47,770
but actually it's everything that comes
from it, the crime and the gangs. And,

1306
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:53,110
and that's, I think, you know,
the, the most intelligent
argument. Full legalization.

1307
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,830
Yeah. And there was a real interesting
article recently about Mexico.

1308
01:15:56,830 --> 01:16:01,830
They were talking about the cartels like
hemorrhaging money because they relied

1309
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:04,990
on marijuana trade and
now with legal marijuana,

1310
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:09,190
just the legal marijuana in
Colorado and in Washington state,

1311
01:16:09,191 --> 01:16:14,191
and then all the medical places have
massively diminished the amount of

1312
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:19,300
influence that these guys have of the
amount of wealth that they can get from

1313
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:21,970
selling illegal drugs.
Cause people don't need it anymore.

1314
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,730
It's just super easy to get.
So like the marijuana trade,

1315
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:27,970
which is one of the most common drugs,
it's kind of drying up for them.

1316
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:31,300
And so they're scrambling to try to
find some other avenues of revenue.

1317
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:36,370
It's pretty interesting stuff because
it's just shows people like this is,

1318
01:16:36,371 --> 01:16:38,780
this is what you do when you
make things illegal and it's,

1319
01:16:39,040 --> 01:16:42,310
we should have figured it out in
the 1920s with prohibition. I mean,

1320
01:16:42,311 --> 01:16:46,870
it's amazing that people are so goofy
today that they still are or are dealing

1321
01:16:46,871 --> 01:16:51,871
with the same issue that they kind of
resolved in the 1920s you almost a hundred

1322
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:52,120
years ago,

1323
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,710
they figured this out with alcohol and
they have to relearn the same lesson with,

1324
01:16:56,711 --> 01:17:00,790
uh, with cannabis. It's just,
it's nutty and it's, again,

1325
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:05,820
it's another thing where it's a personal
issue where you have just too many God

1326
01:17:05,841 --> 01:17:08,890
damn laws. You have too many restrictions
on personal for. Exactly right.

1327
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,160
And it's interesting,

1328
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,840
I think that the, the politicians have
been put off for a long time from,

1329
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:15,830
from doing anything about it,

1330
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:19,970
by the kind of reaction that they'll think
they'll get from certain parts of the

1331
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:20,840
price and so on.

1332
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:24,080
But actually I think that's changing
and it's changing really quickly here in

1333
01:17:24,081 --> 01:17:24,850
America.

1334
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:28,700
And the fact that you've got these ballot
measures that are winning in different

1335
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:30,500
states and that's just going
to accelerate, I think,

1336
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,830
not just that, the amount of revenue they
pull in with no resistance whatsoever.

1337
01:17:34,831 --> 01:17:39,831
Colorado has 39% tax revenue on
marijuana that's sold recreationally,

1338
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:44,880
39% and everyone there is
like, okay, 39% is cool.

1339
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:45,781
They'll be like,

1340
01:17:45,781 --> 01:17:50,781
no one's arguing over the
most preposterous sales rate
ever that that is 39% is

1341
01:17:52,141 --> 01:17:55,890
fucking crazy. It's basically
the government is a drug dealer.

1342
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:59,610
I mean that's what it is. I mean,
so you're not just taking taxes,

1343
01:17:59,611 --> 01:18:03,570
you're fucking a partner. You're a
partner in this 39% is a big partner.

1344
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,940
You're at almost 40% okay.

1345
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:11,180
And then they're making over a hundred
million dollars a year in tax revenue

1346
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:15,390
just in the state of Colorado. So when
that kind of money starts coming in,

1347
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:16,320
then they,

1348
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:20,550
that money has influence and then they
have to respect the pot dollar because

1349
01:18:20,551 --> 01:18:23,250
the pot dollar is going to be a lobby.
Just like anything else,

1350
01:18:23,251 --> 01:18:26,940
just like the pharmaceutical lobby,
just like the natural resource lobby.

1351
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:27,870
Just like anything else,

1352
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:31,860
the pot lobby's going to be legit now
because there's going to be a tremendous

1353
01:18:31,861 --> 01:18:35,730
amount of revenue available
and big business there.

1354
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:39,780
There's a big businesses that are
moving into Colorado right now and

1355
01:18:39,781 --> 01:18:43,230
establishing warehouse warehouse
spaces in Colorado are just,

1356
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,520
they're evaporating,

1357
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:47,120
they're disappearing left
and right because people
just picking them up and they

1358
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:51,150
were, the way Colorado's laws are
set up, in order to sell marijuana,

1359
01:18:51,151 --> 01:18:55,050
you have to grow marijuana, so if you
wanted to open up a shop in Colorado,

1360
01:18:55,051 --> 01:18:57,780
you'd have to grow your
own stuff and then sell it.

1361
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:00,000
You can't buy it from someone
else and then sell it.

1362
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:05,580
So they're just giant warehouses
everywhere of being scooped up and they're

1363
01:19:05,581 --> 01:19:09,450
setting up these massive grow ops and
then they're funneling that money because

1364
01:19:09,451 --> 01:19:12,810
it's being sold legally to funneling
that money right back in the state at a

1365
01:19:12,811 --> 01:19:14,190
rate of 39%.

1366
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:19,430
It's crazy and huge companies are slowly
but surely creeping their way towards

1367
01:19:20,851 --> 01:19:22,530
Colorado because they realize this is,

1368
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:26,310
this is a multibillion dollar
industry and just a couple of years,

1369
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,280
you're looking at three,
four, five years from now,

1370
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:31,530
a multibillion dollar industry,

1371
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:36,090
nationwide cut places where they're
having serious money being issues,

1372
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:38,910
serious problems with
generating tax revenue.

1373
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,560
All of the sudden all the profits that
are going to illegal sales of marijuana,

1374
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:48,590
now 39% of that money is gonna come
right to the taxpayers are a right to the

1375
01:19:49,261 --> 01:19:49,570
tax

1376
01:19:49,570 --> 01:19:52,780
blunders. And if they got any,
um, I guess it's a bit early,

1377
01:19:52,781 --> 01:19:53,920
but I was just wondering what the,

1378
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,910
what they're seeing in terms of
people's behavior that usage,

1379
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:01,640
lower crime, the other drug, is that
right? Lower crime and lower murder rates.

1380
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:06,250
Murder rates have dropped in Denver.
Yeah, of course they're high.

1381
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:09,270
It's an eye they're to, they're
going to get twice. Well,

1382
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,900
they're going to think twice.
They're gonna think about it.

1383
01:20:10,901 --> 01:20:14,490
I don't need the sheet. That guy's an
asshole, but whatever. It's his problem.

1384
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:19,260
You know? Look, it's, it's
never good to suppress people.

1385
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:24,090
And when you have something
that's irrational, like
marijuana laws, there's it,

1386
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,260
it gives people this feeling of
frustration. Does this disconnect?

1387
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,670
It gives them this feeling of
being disenfranchised with the,

1388
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,480
the people that are supposedly in charge,
you know? And it makes them upset. Like,

1389
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:39,870
why should a grown man be able to come?
If it was only two of us,

1390
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:42,690
we were living on an island
and I was like, Steve,

1391
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:44,610
I don't think you should smoke pot.
If you smoke pot,

1392
01:20:44,611 --> 01:20:48,470
I'm gonna lock you in a fucking cage.
He'd be like, you're an asshole. Right?

1393
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,280
Like there's only two. What
do you give a shit? What I do,

1394
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,220
it's when there's 2 million of us that
you feel like you can get away with.

1395
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:56,190
Something like that, that someone could
come along and say, I'm the sheriff.

1396
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:58,890
And if I find someone's smoking
marijuana and my district,

1397
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:02,790
I'm going to put them under lock and key
and I'm going to make our streets safe

1398
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,280
for the children.
All that stupid shit that they say,

1399
01:21:05,281 --> 01:21:08,160
well it's just too many numbers,
too many people.

1400
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:11,230
But what I'm interested in is
like just coming to, you know,

1401
01:21:11,231 --> 01:21:12,100
I've been here two years now,

1402
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:16,310
but I do get a feeling that
that is a really quite um,

1403
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:20,620
kind of almost mainstream position.
A lot of people feel like that in America.

1404
01:21:20,621 --> 01:21:21,940
Maybe it's a California thing,
I don't know.

1405
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:26,650
But then I'm interested why
the libertarian movement in a,

1406
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,360
the political expression of that kind of
attitude is the libertarian party that

1407
01:21:31,361 --> 01:21:33,850
candidates, they, they
don't seem to get anywhere.

1408
01:21:33,851 --> 01:21:37,690
They don't seem to do well even though
that kind of attitude feels to me like

1409
01:21:37,691 --> 01:21:42,691
it's really very kind of true to the
American approach to things and is shared

1410
01:21:42,821 --> 01:21:44,580
by a lot of people.
Like I kind of hear that a lot.

1411
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:48,760
I think it's slowly but surely
starting to gain momentum.

1412
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:52,360
But I think the Internet's
influences barely,

1413
01:21:53,110 --> 01:21:57,910
barely two decades in 1994 to 2014 right.
That's,

1414
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,130
that's the realistic take on it.

1415
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:05,350
But the real impact as far as
like social impact, I would,

1416
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,820
I would say it's probably a decade.
10 years is not that much time.

1417
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:14,710
And then in that decade how much of it
has been concentrated on social change

1418
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,920
and how much of it's been
concentrated on porn? You know,

1419
01:22:17,921 --> 01:22:21,790
how much of it is concentrated? I look,
we can see tits anytime you want now. Woo.

1420
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,320
And this new found freedom, this new
found ability to access information,

1421
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:26,731
it's just,

1422
01:22:26,731 --> 01:22:31,420
it's going to take a while before I
think people are evolving right now.

1423
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:34,360
I really do socially, um, at a,

1424
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:38,530
at a rate that's just unheard of is
never the kind of movements that you're

1425
01:22:38,531 --> 01:22:40,600
seeing now whether you
agree with them or not,

1426
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:43,610
whether it's Operation Wall
Street or whether it's a,

1427
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:46,900
anytime there's a social change or
social movement in this country,

1428
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,220
whether you agree with it or not,

1429
01:22:48,221 --> 01:22:53,221
it's fascinating to step back and watch
this swarm of activity that takes place

1430
01:22:55,481 --> 01:22:59,440
because of any issue that comes
up now that really couldn't,

1431
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:01,870
couldn't happen before without,
you know,

1432
01:23:01,871 --> 01:23:04,240
you'd have to have like a physical
meeting you'd have to have,

1433
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:07,960
people would get and someone to have to
have a megaphone and we'll we need to do

1434
01:23:07,961 --> 01:23:09,370
is take back the streets.

1435
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:14,680
Well we need to do is make the world
safe for our children and we need to get

1436
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:18,770
out of Vietnam. Yeah. You
know, and then you know,

1437
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:21,820
the cops come and break it up and hose
everybody down and they would shut down

1438
01:23:21,821 --> 01:23:24,370
the problem.
We can't do that anymore.

1439
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,490
You can't shut down the problems
because the problem exists on reddit.

1440
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,270
The problem exists on millions
of people's Twitter accounts.

1441
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,910
They're posting things.
There probably exists on Facebook.

1442
01:23:33,911 --> 01:23:38,911
The problem exists anytime there's
dissent that dissent sort of encapsulates

1443
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:45,310
an entire group of people that share
these ideas and they can feel freely

1444
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:46,144
communicate.

1445
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:50,200
And I think they're just starting to
realize that they can freely communicate

1446
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:54,340
the way they can and unfortunately a
lot of them are annoying. Unfortunately,

1447
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:57,370
a lot of people that have fit figure
this out or annoying and you see these

1448
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:00,190
really dumb ideas that
spread like wildfire,

1449
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,830
wildfire and a bunch of idiots
are behind it. And it's,

1450
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:04,390
that's fascinating to watch too.

1451
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:08,920
But I think ultimately when
it all balances itself out,

1452
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:12,790
we're going to deal with a much
more informed, much more educated,

1453
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:13,720
much more aware,

1454
01:24:13,721 --> 01:24:17,410
much more socially conscious society
than we have ever had in the past.

1455
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:20,410
I think a decade from now to deck,
two decades from now,

1456
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:24,480
we're going to see the rewards of this.
And I'm very optimistic. I like it

1457
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:26,680
that, that way of
thinking about it. And I,

1458
01:24:26,681 --> 01:24:31,230
I agree and I guess what we w w the
way we're thinking about it is that,

1459
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:33,110
that we want to kind of,

1460
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:38,680
now the next step really is to
really take that energy and,

1461
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,150
and really direct it into the
heart of the political system. Mm.

1462
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:47,690
Not kind of on the edges of it.
We've kind of protests and, and, um,

1463
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:52,220
and sort of social movements, but really
getting into the guts of the, of the,

1464
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:56,320
of the way laws are made and
the way the country's run,

1465
01:24:56,330 --> 01:25:00,230
the states who were on cities are, and,
and, and kind of injecting it into the,

1466
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:04,520
into the real heart of power.
I think that's gotta be the next step.

1467
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:08,890
Yes. I, I agree. And I hope
that it can be done. I mean,

1468
01:25:08,891 --> 01:25:13,891
I wonder if the way technology
is advancing and the way
technological innovation

1469
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:16,210
seems to exponentially increase,

1470
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:21,820
if there's some way to manage
things in a way that's sort of,

1471
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:26,200
um,
not discovered yet or sort of hasn't been,

1472
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,460
no one's figured out a way to
sort of organize this whole thing.

1473
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:35,200
In a way that's much clearer and now
we're dealing, it's almost like code.

1474
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,980
Like do you remember what code used
to look like when you used to use dos?

1475
01:25:38,981 --> 01:25:43,330
And if you use an old computer
yet an mtor, everything
had command prompts. Yeah.

1476
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:47,290
But then someone came along like xerox
figured out this graphic user interface.

1477
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:50,260
It just, Whoa, fuck all that. Just
to see that thing. Just double.

1478
01:25:50,270 --> 01:25:52,900
Just press twice when you
want that to open up and boom,

1479
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:56,270
and then you'll see a graphic
representation of what you want.

1480
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,570
That's a much more simplistic element.

1481
01:25:58,660 --> 01:26:01,960
You don't have to look at all the code
behind what you're doing when you're

1482
01:26:01,961 --> 01:26:06,890
using Microsoft word. Uh, cut all
that shit out. Let's just see. Let's,

1483
01:26:06,891 --> 01:26:11,600
let's make it real simple. And if we could
get, get it to that in politics, like,

1484
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,650
okay, what would make, what would,

1485
01:26:15,651 --> 01:26:20,651
what would we have to do to make more
money go towards school and less money go

1486
01:26:21,411 --> 01:26:24,550
towards war. Like is
that, is that a way it,

1487
01:26:24,551 --> 01:26:25,940
was there a way we could work that out?

1488
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:29,180
If you look at how much money
is being spent in the Iraq war,

1489
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:32,120
how much money's being
spent in Afghanistan,

1490
01:26:32,390 --> 01:26:37,390
is there a way to take 30% of
that and put it into our schools?

1491
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:41,510
Because my God, the school system would
radically change our education system,

1492
01:26:41,511 --> 01:26:45,530
would radically change the amount of
people that would come out of these

1493
01:26:45,531 --> 01:26:49,310
educational systems
that were more balanced,

1494
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,730
more aware,
had more nuanced perspectives,

1495
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:55,160
would radically change our country,

1496
01:26:55,310 --> 01:26:58,730
would radically improve like
over the course of a decade.

1497
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:03,910
If you could just figure out a way to
put that kind of power in people's hands,

1498
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:05,270
what they choose to do.

1499
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:07,720
Well,
I think the way that you do that is,

1500
01:27:07,721 --> 01:27:12,550
it goes back to what we were saying
earlier is is actually literally doing it

1501
01:27:12,551 --> 01:27:16,960
by, by getting rid of these
kind of big organizations,

1502
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:22,250
central government organizations that
try and run the whole system from some

1503
01:27:23,381 --> 01:27:25,690
office somewhere that's
completely removed from the,

1504
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:29,230
from the parents and the kids that was
actually using the schools and and really

1505
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,840
give responsibility for this.

1506
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:36,700
The way the schools operate to local
communities so that they can try things

1507
01:27:36,701 --> 01:27:38,500
out.
Because every kid is different.

1508
01:27:38,501 --> 01:27:40,990
They learn in different ways and whatever
nature it feels to me like when it

1509
01:27:40,991 --> 01:27:44,410
comes to education, we've got this
approach which is someone has decided,

1510
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:45,790
you know,
this is the theory,

1511
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:49,690
this is how we're going to get kids to
learn whatever it may be and we're going

1512
01:27:49,691 --> 01:27:54,580
to try and have a kind of common
application of that in every school and

1513
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:57,100
everyone's going to teach the
same way and that's great.

1514
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:00,070
And I just think that the
evidence shows that is not right.

1515
01:28:00,071 --> 01:28:05,071
It doesn't work for every kid and you
want to have a system where you know you,

1516
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:10,570
you've got much more ability to experiment
and try things out and adapt things

1517
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:15,640
to each, each, you know, different type
of child and the way that they learn.

1518
01:28:15,641 --> 01:28:20,410
And I think we need to see a lot more
kind of smaller schools where they're much

1519
01:28:20,411 --> 01:28:22,720
more kind of community run uphill.
I sang with the gardening.

1520
01:28:22,721 --> 01:28:27,100
I think sort of a community approach to
these things is going to be the way to

1521
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:27,251
do it.

1522
01:28:27,251 --> 01:28:30,640
You definitely need the money of course
to sort of have high quality as well.

1523
01:28:30,850 --> 01:28:31,690
So I agree with that.

1524
01:28:31,691 --> 01:28:36,691
It's just that if you just put more money
into the current system of organizing

1525
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:37,390
schools,

1526
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:41,620
I don't think you'll get
the kind of benefit that you
could if you actually gave

1527
01:28:41,621 --> 01:28:45,460
the power of the system and took it away
from the people at the center and put

1528
01:28:45,461 --> 01:28:47,830
it in the hands of people locally
that that's how I would do it.

1529
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:52,740
And if they did that you could also see
the results positive and negative and

1530
01:28:52,741 --> 01:28:54,180
imitate the positive ones.

1531
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:58,140
You could see like these people have an
approach and their approach is more sort

1532
01:28:58,141 --> 01:29:02,070
of Waldorf school based and
less electronics and wouldn't

1533
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,760
toys and interacting with kids and
look at the benefits like, man,

1534
01:29:05,761 --> 01:29:07,650
all these people are
coming out so creative.

1535
01:29:08,010 --> 01:29:11,190
But then there's another place in San
Francisco that's much more tech involved.

1536
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,110
Everybody has an iPad and all these kids.

1537
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,240
Well we'll leave it as
a benefit there as well.

1538
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:20,510
I mean I think schools are a huge issue.
The massive underfunding of education.

1539
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:22,280
This country is a huge,
huge issue and it's,

1540
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:27,450
it's madness and it's almost like sort
of ensuring that poverty and that this

1541
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:30,020
was going to be right. You
know what I mean? Yeah.

1542
01:29:30,230 --> 01:29:33,900
I done a lot of it is the kind of
people that go into teaching, you know,

1543
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,500
you really, you'd want the
best people, the smartest,

1544
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:39,060
best people going into teaching.

1545
01:29:39,061 --> 01:29:42,660
It's like the most important job
that get paid $20,000 a year. Right.

1546
01:29:42,661 --> 01:29:46,050
And that is not going to get that if
you'll pay those kinds of, you know,

1547
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:50,460
it's really kind of obvious.
We apply that in every other kind of area.

1548
01:29:50,730 --> 01:29:54,120
You kind of know that if you pay more,
you get something better generally.

1549
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:58,490
And I think that that is a huge part
of it is actually if you, you know,

1550
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:02,340
trying to get the best people in the
countries that have done really well.

1551
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:06,060
I think that Finland is a good example
from what I know. I'm, you know,

1552
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:08,170
I spent quite a lot of time this when
I was in the government. Finland is a,

1553
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:12,290
is a place where it is the cultural
thing. If you know a really, um,

1554
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:17,340
admired an esteem thing to do and well
rewarded is to go and be a teacher.

1555
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:20,370
It's like one of the best things
you can do. And that's true.

1556
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:23,290
I think of a lot of the
Scandinavian countries and
they have better results as a

1557
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:24,180
know thanks to that.

1558
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:28,110
So you've got to just get the
best people to go into teaching.

1559
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:30,630
That's really important in this country.

1560
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:35,660
The prohibitive cost of higher education
is shocking when you start thinking

1561
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:38,100
about how much money it
costs to go to college,

1562
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:39,750
how much money it cost to get a degree,

1563
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:43,770
and you accumulate student loans
that are almost insurmountable.

1564
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:46,290
How many people get out of
college in this country?

1565
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:50,160
It's amazing that the figures are just
unbelievable. They are so in debt,

1566
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:52,200
just stunningly in debt.

1567
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:57,300
Like I have a friend who is in
his 50s and just paid off his,

1568
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:02,190
his, his uh, 50s. Yes. Wow. Just
paid off from medical school.

1569
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,950
This isn't fucking insurmountable debt.
Insurmountable debt forever. Yeah,

1570
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:13,100
just slowly but surely chipping away at
hundreds of thousands of dollars in an

1571
01:31:14,251 --> 01:31:17,460
educational debt. It's
really amazing. I mean,

1572
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:21,180
one of the things I'm doing right now is
teaching at Stanford a little bit and,

1573
01:31:21,181 --> 01:31:25,560
um, and it's just, there's,
there's a kind of good point,

1574
01:31:25,630 --> 01:31:29,790
which is that it seems to me that
the students are so much more,

1575
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:31,143
um,

1576
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:36,180
hardworking and motivated than the ones
that will certainly than I was not seen

1577
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:37,370
diversity,
but you know,

1578
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:40,910
it was all free when we did it in
the UK and here it's not anymore,

1579
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:45,870
but it was when I was at college and here
when they're paying so much for their

1580
01:31:45,871 --> 01:31:48,930
parents are paying so much, they take
it really seriously and that's great.

1581
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,670
But the, the amounts of money involved,
I just staggering. Really unbelievable.

1582
01:31:53,671 --> 01:31:57,160
Especially when you get to law
school or medical school or you know,

1583
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:59,860
any really expensive school.
Stanford,

1584
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:03,260
you know, that's a very
prestigious school. It's going to,

1585
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:04,750
cause it must be ridiculous.
I mean,

1586
01:32:04,751 --> 01:32:06,210
how much does the kid have
to pay a year to go to,

1587
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:09,540
cause they have a lot of, um, uh, they do,

1588
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:13,260
they do a lot of great work to kind of
make it possible for kids without the

1589
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:13,741
money to go.

1590
01:32:13,741 --> 01:32:16,500
So they do a lot of grants
and scholarships and I don't
know how that all works

1591
01:32:16,501 --> 01:32:20,310
out. Well that's what it's
it's, but it's a huge amount.

1592
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:22,410
Yeah. That, that's nice.

1593
01:32:22,411 --> 01:32:26,010
And it's beautiful to hear that
they do something along those lines.

1594
01:32:26,011 --> 01:32:27,480
And it's also beautiful to hear that,
uh,

1595
01:32:27,481 --> 01:32:31,590
I believe it was MIT has released
all of us, it studies online.

1596
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:34,110
You can take all of its
classes online for free,

1597
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:38,970
essentially get an MIT education through
your home computer. Just very nice.

1598
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,290
It's very nice that, that, and you,

1599
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:45,600
if you think about the amount of access
that people have to higher education

1600
01:32:45,601 --> 01:32:47,520
today when it comes to online courses,

1601
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:51,570
when it comes to just papers that they
could read and download documentaries,

1602
01:32:51,571 --> 01:32:56,310
they can watch different things that they
can read. It's, it's kind of incredible.

1603
01:32:56,380 --> 01:32:56,711
Yeah.

1604
01:32:56,711 --> 01:33:01,460
And it's actually really powerful in
not just thinking about America but um,

1605
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:05,770
and people in the, in the states
who wouldn't have had that access,

1606
01:33:05,771 --> 01:33:09,290
but actually all over the world, it's
this, that, you know, in Africa where you,

1607
01:33:09,330 --> 01:33:13,190
you're just able to bring, you know,
instruction and the, you know, the,

1608
01:33:13,191 --> 01:33:14,350
the best people in the world,

1609
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:18,490
the best teachers to the
most remote village in Africa
is completely staggering.

1610
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:20,920
Yeah, it is. It is interesting.

1611
01:33:20,921 --> 01:33:24,290
And I've always had a
fascination with the,

1612
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:29,080
the power that someone has in the position
of being a professor and especially

1613
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:33,110
professor with tenure where
they have this, you know,

1614
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:36,910
kind of this job that essentially it's
very difficult to get fired from. I mean,

1615
01:33:36,911 --> 01:33:41,050
you have to really do something really
fucked up. Yeah. To lose your position.

1616
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:44,320
And because of that,
some of them,

1617
01:33:44,350 --> 01:33:47,200
and I've had friends that
have had these professors,

1618
01:33:47,470 --> 01:33:52,470
some of them get these incredibly arrogant
attitudes and they push their ideas

1619
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:57,020
as if their doctrine,
right.

1620
01:33:57,070 --> 01:34:01,060
And they push their own political
ideas and their own ideology.

1621
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:06,330
Oftentimes a very left wing liberal agenda
to the point where it just infuriates

1622
01:34:07,421 --> 01:34:11,140
certain parents and infuriates
people who disagree with these ideas,

1623
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:15,760
who gets silenced because you know,
it's the professor's word and that is it.

1624
01:34:15,761 --> 01:34:19,440
In my class, this is how I
feel. It was not education.
I mean the, you know, to me,

1625
01:34:19,441 --> 01:34:19,560
yeah.

1626
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:24,450
The whole point is you should be equipping
the students to think for themselves

1627
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:27,480
and to, and to kind of come
to their own point of view,

1628
01:34:27,690 --> 01:34:30,060
but give them the tools that
they can do that with and, and,

1629
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,990
and go out and then use that knowledge
and ability to do great things in the

1630
01:34:33,991 --> 01:34:36,230
world. Not to kind of tell them
your point of view. I mean,

1631
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,650
that's where you can tell
them your point of view,

1632
01:34:37,651 --> 01:34:41,100
but make clear that it is your point of
view and there are other points of view

1633
01:34:41,101 --> 01:34:42,840
and it's up to them to
decide what they think.

1634
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:44,200
Yeah.
But that lack of,

1635
01:34:44,230 --> 01:34:49,230
that humility is oftentimes lacking when
you have a person that has absolutely.

1636
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:54,220
That's right. There's no
kind of accountability there
because it's just, you know,

1637
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,120
they don't have to deliver any.

1638
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,220
That is like one of the complaints right

1639
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:02,330
about the amazing thing though.
I loved the speech that um, uh,

1640
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:05,130
Mike Bloomberg gave the other, I think
it was last week, did you see this?

1641
01:35:05,131 --> 01:35:09,030
He went to Harvard and
he gave a commencement
commencement speech I think to

1642
01:35:09,031 --> 01:35:13,470
Harvard where he really attacked him on
this point and said that they had this

1643
01:35:13,471 --> 01:35:15,480
kind of liberal bias in the,

1644
01:35:15,481 --> 01:35:19,530
in the faculty there that was
just really bad. And the, yeah.

1645
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:22,920
And he had this great piece of data,

1646
01:35:22,921 --> 01:35:26,340
which was that if you look at,
it's going back to campaign finance,

1647
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:29,730
if you look at the campaign finance
records, because that, you know,

1648
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:31,650
everyone's donations,
it reported and when you,

1649
01:35:31,651 --> 01:35:33,000
when you make a political donation,

1650
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:37,290
you have to say what your
occupation is so you, you, you know,

1651
01:35:37,291 --> 01:35:38,350
it's quite easy to,

1652
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:43,110
to look at types of professions or
whatever and where their money goes.

1653
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:44,940
And he got this piece of data,

1654
01:35:44,941 --> 01:35:49,941
which was that if you look
at the political donations
of Ivy League faculty and

1655
01:35:50,701 --> 01:35:54,360
staff, and you look at where the
money went in the last election,

1656
01:35:54,810 --> 01:35:57,810
the figure for how much
went to Obama was 96%.

1657
01:35:58,410 --> 01:36:03,180
So it was like this total liberal
dominance and he said that is just not

1658
01:36:03,181 --> 01:36:05,670
healthy. That is not what the
university is supposed to be.

1659
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:10,980
The problem is the alternative was far
more offensive if they went to John

1660
01:36:12,550 --> 01:36:17,050
Mccain and Sarah Palin did that 4%
is the problem. Believe it or not,

1661
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,900
in this country. I mean, Obama's,

1662
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:24,910
I'm not a fan of what this
administration has become,

1663
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:27,190
especially when it can turn when it can.
Uh,

1664
01:36:27,191 --> 01:36:31,330
it deals with freedom of the press
when it deals with whistle blowers,

1665
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:34,270
when it deals with a spying on Americans,

1666
01:36:34,271 --> 01:36:38,260
like all the revelation that we found
out about the lack of privacy that people

1667
01:36:38,261 --> 01:36:42,130
have. I'm not a fan of
that at all, but God damn,

1668
01:36:42,131 --> 01:36:45,370
having Sarah Palin as the vice president
of the fucking United States would have

1669
01:36:45,371 --> 01:36:47,020
been disastrous.
Having a,

1670
01:36:47,021 --> 01:36:51,550
an old man who's playing poker where
they're talking about going to war with

1671
01:36:51,551 --> 01:36:56,470
Syria, who's literally sitting on
his phone playing poker, you know,

1672
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:01,240
I mean, what the fuck that was a president
that, that was the vice president,

1673
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:05,410
those two dummies. I mean,
that's a disaster. That's a
fucking God damn disaster.

1674
01:37:05,411 --> 01:37:10,411
So of course the most educated amongst
them went for the lesser of two evils.

1675
01:37:10,631 --> 01:37:15,190
Being Obama,
being a guy who was a very articulate,

1676
01:37:15,191 --> 01:37:19,270
intelligent guy who's a whore. I mean,
essentially that's what Obama is.

1677
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:22,630
He's what he is,
is a guy who's very intelligent,

1678
01:37:22,631 --> 01:37:26,980
articulate guy who had these
ideas and promoted this ideology,

1679
01:37:27,010 --> 01:37:30,880
got into office and did essentially
exactly what Bush did. I mean,

1680
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:35,460
in worse when it comes to whistle blowers
and stuff, yeah, yeah. And well, you know,

1681
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:39,100
all the things that we're going to do,
we're going to close down Guantanamo Bay.

1682
01:37:39,101 --> 01:37:42,940
We going to get out of Afghanistan.
It turns out most of it was bullshit.

1683
01:37:42,970 --> 01:37:47,080
Most of it. I mean, when you talk to
people that are, that are journalists,

1684
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:51,700
this country has a horrible record and
this administration has a horrible record

1685
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:56,760
on freedom of the press, a horrible
record on punishing whistle. And it's, uh,

1686
01:37:56,850 --> 01:38:01,050
the, the, the lack of,
the lack of respect for,

1687
01:38:01,051 --> 01:38:04,260
for journalism and freedom of the press
is very disturbing to people because

1688
01:38:04,261 --> 01:38:06,450
what,
what is journalism truly well,

1689
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:10,110
what it truly is is
you're exposing reality.

1690
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,440
What a true journalist is
doing is exposing reality.

1691
01:38:13,441 --> 01:38:15,120
When you punish people for doing that,

1692
01:38:15,330 --> 01:38:18,570
when you punish people for blowing
the whistle on what is essentially

1693
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:23,870
unconstitutional activities like the NSA
spying on every single fucking person

1694
01:38:24,451 --> 01:38:27,030
on the planet, I mean,
that's unconstitutional.

1695
01:38:27,031 --> 01:38:30,510
When you record everyone's phone call,
that's not what we want.

1696
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:34,020
And when the government supports
things like that, I mean, how,

1697
01:38:34,050 --> 01:38:37,020
how is this the same guy that
was like, hope and change? How,

1698
01:38:37,021 --> 01:38:38,400
how is this the same guy?
Well,

1699
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:41,670
he's the same guy because the people
that fucking got him in the office,

1700
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,010
or the same people that
got Bush in the office,

1701
01:38:44,011 --> 01:38:49,011
the same goddamn influences and things
like Crowdpac things that you're trying

1702
01:38:49,831 --> 01:38:52,210
to do. What expose that for folks? Yeah,

1703
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,100
the, I mean, that's the idea
we're trying to be and you know,

1704
01:38:55,101 --> 01:38:59,440
it's really important that we're,
um, you know, it's, you know,

1705
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:00,800
we just going to nonpartisan.

1706
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:04,590
So while we've got a strong point of view
about the system generally and how we

1707
01:39:04,591 --> 01:39:08,760
can improve it, you know, we don't really,
it's very important. Don't take sides.

1708
01:39:08,761 --> 01:39:11,820
We don't have a point of view as
a company about individual issues,

1709
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:16,080
but I think that we do really care
about, um, changing the system.

1710
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,440
And I think that one of the,
one of the things about the press that,

1711
01:39:21,441 --> 01:39:24,360
that sort of happens, and I've seen
this, I'm kind of both sides of it,

1712
01:39:24,361 --> 01:39:29,190
is that there tends to be this kind of
coziness that develops with a lot with a

1713
01:39:29,191 --> 01:39:32,600
lot of the press, particularly the
traditional press where, you know,

1714
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:36,300
they want to have access
to the politicians and the
politicians want to get

1715
01:39:36,301 --> 01:39:38,670
their message out and it
just gets quite kind of cozy.

1716
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:43,200
And so that whole role of
investigation and exposing things, um,

1717
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:48,440
kind of sometimes takes a backseat to
having a good relationship so that you can

1718
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:50,370
get your message out and that,
and they get access.

1719
01:39:50,371 --> 01:39:51,840
And I think that that's one of the things,
again,

1720
01:39:51,841 --> 01:39:55,020
that's really helpfully being changed
by technology, like you were saying,

1721
01:39:55,021 --> 01:39:59,010
which is that, um, you've got people
who are able to get, you know, to,

1722
01:39:59,070 --> 01:40:04,070
to do that job of investigation without
having to be part of some cozy group

1723
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:06,510
around the politician.
Yeah.

1724
01:40:06,610 --> 01:40:10,710
He's going to lob softballs
and every politician, you see

1725
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:13,710
it from the politician's point of view,
their point of view, and it's, you know,

1726
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:17,490
there's a lot of truth to it is that
they're trying to do stuff. It's really,

1727
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:21,060
really hard. You know, trying to deal with
some of these problems is difficult. Um,

1728
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:26,040
there's incredible expectations.
Um, you get chip for what, you know,

1729
01:40:26,041 --> 01:40:30,030
just trying, um, you're totally under
scrutiny. Your life is under scrutiny.

1730
01:40:30,031 --> 01:40:31,560
It's a really,
really hard job.

1731
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:37,340
And they feel that the increasingly
the media and the press and are just

1732
01:40:37,651 --> 01:40:40,230
interested in the trivial aspects of it
and who's up and who's down and they're

1733
01:40:40,231 --> 01:40:44,370
not really interested in kind of exposing
the complexity of some of these issues,

1734
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:48,750
blah, blah. So that, that's
how the politicians see it.
And then on the other side,

1735
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:51,180
and that's why they end up trying to,
you know,

1736
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:53,950
have a relationship that enables them to,
in the,

1737
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:56,580
in there and the way they see it to,

1738
01:40:56,770 --> 01:41:00,250
to explain what they're trying
to do a bit better so that they,

1739
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:03,850
so people kind of give them a fair
hearing. So that's why that all happens.

1740
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:07,720
And you know, there's a lot of, there's
a lot of truth to that. To be honest.

1741
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:10,850
It is difficult what they're
trying to do. Um, whatever,

1742
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:15,250
whatever your Liberal
Democrat or conservative or
does it makes no difference.

1743
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:18,580
It's difficult. Governing is
difficult. It's complicated.

1744
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:20,740
The problems are complicated.
Everyone's got their point of view,

1745
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:24,310
you're kind of being screamed at and
yelled at the whole time and it's hard.

1746
01:41:24,520 --> 01:41:28,930
Now look, they choose to go into it so
we cannot feel sorry for them. You know,

1747
01:41:28,931 --> 01:41:31,000
they make that choice. Like you
said, they have that kind of,

1748
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:33,370
I'm going to be the leader and I'm
going to go there and sort things out.

1749
01:41:33,371 --> 01:41:34,660
So it's the choice that they made,

1750
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:38,820
but it is difficult and that's
why they want to, you know,

1751
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:43,330
try and can't control the message I
think because they feel that a lot of the

1752
01:41:43,331 --> 01:41:44,500
time they don't get a fair hearing.

1753
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:47,870
Well that makes sense in some ways,

1754
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:52,220
but it doesn't make sense from the point
of view of the people that are in the

1755
01:41:52,221 --> 01:41:56,360
position of being a journalist. If you're
in the position of being a journalist.

1756
01:41:56,420 --> 01:42:01,370
Fair enough. Yeah, you, you're, your
whole position is to expose inequality,

1757
01:42:01,820 --> 01:42:05,600
expose violations of the constitution.

1758
01:42:06,110 --> 01:42:10,040
And when you are,
you're in one of those places where you,

1759
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:13,760
whether it's for CNN or Fox News
or whoever you're working for,

1760
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:18,290
if you get to sit down with Dick Cheney
or you get to sit down with Obama,

1761
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,450
you're already muted. You're already
neutered, you're already silenced.

1762
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,940
You don't get that chance to pro.

1763
01:42:26,060 --> 01:42:30,620
They're never going to have Glenn
Greenwald sit down with Obama and an open

1764
01:42:30,621 --> 01:42:34,430
internet forum that airs in real time
live. They would never agree to that.

1765
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,590
They would never agree.

1766
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:39,180
Greta. This way, it actually, cause it's
a really different tradition in England.

1767
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:40,770
When you look at the way that interview,

1768
01:42:40,771 --> 01:42:45,090
if anyone watches a TV interview of a
politician in England is so different to

1769
01:42:45,091 --> 01:42:48,360
what you get here, they're really
aggressive with them real and you really,

1770
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:50,070
really, really aggressive. And,

1771
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:55,360
and the kind of softball stuff is actually
kind of embarrassing for a journalist

1772
01:42:55,370 --> 01:42:57,330
to do that.
And there's a different tradition.

1773
01:42:57,610 --> 01:42:59,360
Well, we used to have
that. It's really true.

1774
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:02,040
I've really noticed that
they shot a few people,

1775
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,110
Park some cars on railroad
tracks with families in them,

1776
01:43:05,111 --> 01:43:07,850
and then people kind of
stopped doing that. Um,

1777
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:13,300
I think that guys like Glenn Greenwald
who lives in Brazil and gets to sort of

1778
01:43:13,301 --> 01:43:17,590
attack America from a distance, you
know, at least until they find him. I,

1779
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:21,550
I think, uh, what guys like
him are doing with, you know,

1780
01:43:21,551 --> 01:43:23,080
he was the one who helped,
uh,

1781
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:26,980
Edward Snowden release all of
his documents and the, these,

1782
01:43:26,981 --> 01:43:30,460
these new players in this whole game,

1783
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:34,870
these outsiders that don't have to cozy
up don't have to be a part of this, uh,

1784
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:39,550
this nepotism that we're seeing
with the big ones. I mean, any,

1785
01:43:39,551 --> 01:43:42,430
anybody that's in any
sort of a large group,

1786
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:45,100
Fox and CBS and NBC,

1787
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:48,190
you're a part of this wacky system.

1788
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:50,890
You're a part of this system
that's not going to expose these.

1789
01:43:51,290 --> 01:43:55,430
It's going to let these people get
their message out. Because if you don't,

1790
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:58,190
you're not going to get the big names.
If you don't get the big names,

1791
01:43:58,191 --> 01:44:01,340
you're not going to get the ratings. And
then those big names, you can go to Fox,

1792
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:03,140
those big names are
going to go over to CNN.

1793
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:05,930
They're going to go somewhere else and
you're going to lose this, this, yeah,

1794
01:44:05,931 --> 01:44:09,310
that's exactly how they, it seems to work
here. That's what I've noticed. Yeah,

1795
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:10,730
it is.
It is it.

1796
01:44:10,731 --> 01:44:15,731
And I believe it's getting exposed and
I believe it's getting exposed in a way

1797
01:44:15,861 --> 01:44:19,880
today that just wasn't happening
20 years ago. 20 years ago.

1798
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:24,650
You would just be frustrated and you
would just go off and you'd write a book

1799
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:28,010
and everybody go, Oh, he's another look
at the fucking crazy book that guy wrote.

1800
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:31,100
And you know, some people would read
the book and say it was amazing,

1801
01:44:31,101 --> 01:44:34,670
and other people would just ignore it and
new revelations would take place along

1802
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:37,910
the way. And whatever had
happened would be forgotten.

1803
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:40,100
And then the politician
would get out of the office.

1804
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:44,810
And I think George Bush is the last
guy to sort of skate away like that.

1805
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:45,681
And you know,

1806
01:44:45,681 --> 01:44:49,640
now he sits around and paints weird
pictures and slowly goes insane.

1807
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:54,200
Have you seen the things he's doing?
He's slowly going insane. I mean he's,

1808
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:56,960
he's painting pictures and
he's locked in this world of,

1809
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:00,920
he's essentially in a prison on a
ranch. I mean, that's what he is.

1810
01:45:00,921 --> 01:45:04,700
He's constantly circled by secret service
agents. He's hated all over the world.

1811
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:09,200
He's at least indirectly responsible
for over a million deaths.

1812
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:10,341
This one guy,

1813
01:45:10,341 --> 01:45:14,420
they're pinning it on him and Dick Cheney
and his administration and this sort

1814
01:45:14,421 --> 01:45:15,650
of pyramid of events.

1815
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:20,690
And this guy feels that shit and he's
just sort of wandering around on his

1816
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:24,930
fucking ranch, painting himself, staring
at himself in the bathroom mirror. I mean,

1817
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:25,701
it's really,

1818
01:45:25,701 --> 01:45:30,701
really weird stuff and I
think he's probably going
to be the last guy that ever

1819
01:45:31,340 --> 01:45:34,970
skates off into the sunset with
this, this, this knowledge.

1820
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:39,800
I think Obama's going to be
held accountable for a lot
more than Bush ever was.

1821
01:45:40,010 --> 01:45:42,470
And I think whoever's
next is truly fucked,

1822
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:47,300
whether it's Jeb Bush or whether it's
whatever, you know, new Democrat,

1823
01:45:47,301 --> 01:45:49,820
they try to sneak into, I
don't know, Hillary Clinton,

1824
01:45:49,821 --> 01:45:54,470
I don't know what they're trying in 2016
and we won't know for a while because

1825
01:45:54,471 --> 01:45:59,210
they have to vet out. Everyone's fucked
up. Vices and skeletons in their closets.

1826
01:45:59,211 --> 01:46:02,240
And in this day and age,
it's almost, sometimes it's
terrible. I think by the way.

1827
01:46:02,241 --> 01:46:05,330
Cause that's what I, one of the reasons
that so many people get put off from,

1828
01:46:05,450 --> 01:46:08,060
you know, cause a lot of the complaints
you hear about politics as well,

1829
01:46:08,061 --> 01:46:12,820
we just get the same kind of people.
They're all kind of, you know, very, um,

1830
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:15,050
kind of similar to each other.

1831
01:46:15,051 --> 01:46:17,090
And there's a particular type
of person that goes into it.

1832
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:20,330
And actually a lot of people who I think
could make a really good contribution

1833
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,400
don't do it exactly for that reason.

1834
01:46:22,401 --> 01:46:25,600
They just didn't want to live under
that kind of spotlight and can't,

1835
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:29,990
that's just normal human
beings. And they've got stuff
that they had fun. Right.

1836
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:33,530
It's kind of fun in their
life. I mean, people that have
had fun, you know, I mean,

1837
01:46:33,531 --> 01:46:38,531
you can't one gay affair when you're
20 years old with a guy for a couple of

1838
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:40,700
weeks and you're fucked
for the rest of you.

1839
01:46:40,701 --> 01:46:44,240
That guys out there waiting to talk shit
about you. If you run for president,

1840
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:48,510
you know there's one time you did a little
bit of heroin when you're on the row

1841
01:46:48,511 --> 01:46:51,240
with a bunch of your buddies. You
know we were at, you're in college,

1842
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:53,850
you tried heroin. Oh, that's
fucking college buddies.

1843
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:57,140
Ready to write a book about you
doing heroin. I mean there's a,

1844
01:46:57,190 --> 01:47:02,190
it's a weird time when it
comes to exposing people's
pasts and this idea of this

1845
01:47:02,851 --> 01:47:07,170
perfect person from the cradle to
the grave running for president is

1846
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:10,680
preposterous. You don't want
that person, that person,

1847
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,450
if they've never made any mistakes,

1848
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:15,240
that means he never taken any chances
if they haven't taken any chances they

1849
01:47:15,241 --> 01:47:18,360
haven't lived. And I'm not talking
about mistakes like victimizing people,

1850
01:47:18,361 --> 01:47:22,950
horrible things that are completely
unconscionable that you wouldn't do and I

1851
01:47:22,951 --> 01:47:26,310
wouldn't do murder and
robbery and kidnapping,

1852
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:29,430
all sorts of terrible things
that are just massive, you know,

1853
01:47:30,150 --> 01:47:34,980
ethical errors that just shouldn't be
ever tolerated from a person's character.

1854
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:37,440
Just little things like
here's a perfect example.

1855
01:47:37,441 --> 01:47:42,441
There's a woman who's running for mayor
right now in Mississippi and apparently

1856
01:47:42,631 --> 01:47:46,950
when she was younger, she was a
prostitute. And it, this is a,

1857
01:47:46,951 --> 01:47:49,530
it's a big story that,
you know,

1858
01:47:49,531 --> 01:47:54,480
folks are trying to figure out like
what is, is that okay? Like how do we,

1859
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:55,540
how do we handle this?

1860
01:47:55,541 --> 01:48:00,330
Like what do you do about a person who
had made mistakes when they were younger?

1861
01:48:00,331 --> 01:48:03,870
Like what is, what is the answer
to this? And no one really knows.

1862
01:48:03,871 --> 01:48:07,230
They don't really have the answer to
that and trying to figure out like when,

1863
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,090
what is happening in the,
in that is it,

1864
01:48:09,150 --> 01:48:13,110
is it I'm playing against
her or what's this for sure.

1865
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:17,070
She's in Mississippi and
she revealed it herself. Um,

1866
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:22,050
she revealed that she was a former
prostitute and she was a prostitute,

1867
01:48:22,051 --> 01:48:24,030
like I believe it was 30 years ago.

1868
01:48:24,031 --> 01:48:28,320
And she met her husband
while he was a John and, uh,

1869
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:30,560
he was one of her clients and,
uh,

1870
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:35,790
she married him and she hasn't been a
prostitute since and now she's running for

1871
01:48:35,791 --> 01:48:38,940
mayor. And it's, it's a,
it's, it's quite fascinating.

1872
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:41,340
I think it's interesting and
I think in a lot of ways, um,

1873
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:46,700
you could see that and think this person
is actually really well qualified to be

1874
01:48:47,041 --> 01:48:51,510
an office because obviously, you know,
going through those sorts of experiences,

1875
01:48:51,511 --> 01:48:54,760
we'll give you a sense of empathy for,
you know,

1876
01:48:54,780 --> 01:48:57,840
the tough lives that some people have
and this and the second sentence at the

1877
01:48:57,841 --> 01:49:02,340
end up putting them in that situation
and it probably makes you better not was,

1878
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:05,460
well not only that,
what she did was totally legal as well.

1879
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:10,490
She was an illegal brothel in Nevada and
it was over 30 years ago and she hasn't

1880
01:49:12,631 --> 01:49:13,410
been there since.

1881
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:18,410
And the idea that this person is not
allowed to make errors and that she

1882
01:49:18,961 --> 01:49:23,961
wouldn't have developed like a lot of
empathy and character and she wouldn't

1883
01:49:24,301 --> 01:49:25,410
have to think that's right.
Yeah.

1884
01:49:25,411 --> 01:49:30,411
I'm a more balanced perspective than
a person who's grown up in a very

1885
01:49:31,110 --> 01:49:35,700
privileged household with very
rich, wealthy, connected people.

1886
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:38,550
And then they got him to an Ivy League
school and then he became a member of

1887
01:49:38,551 --> 01:49:41,010
skull and crossbones and Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1888
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:42,360
Instead of that,
well,

1889
01:49:42,361 --> 01:49:46,890
you have person who's who was 14 and was
pregnant with a child and had to take

1890
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:48,010
care her child and her parents

1891
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,200
died.
And she had,

1892
01:49:49,201 --> 01:49:53,500
was forced into a situation where she had
to earn a living and she didn't have a

1893
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:56,470
lot of options and this was one
of her options that she chose.

1894
01:49:56,740 --> 01:50:00,730
And how could you judge someone who's
a teenager that makes those choices?

1895
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:03,850
I mean, I don't think he
can. And I think this person,

1896
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:07,990
I mean good for her that she stepped up
and talked about. I think it's great.

1897
01:50:07,991 --> 01:50:09,160
And I again,

1898
01:50:09,161 --> 01:50:14,161
it's kind of interesting that some
types of early childhood adversity,

1899
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:20,380
a kind of okay for your political resume.
Yeah.

1900
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:23,650
I came from a poor family and, but
broken home. What about Bill Clinton?

1901
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:29,530
And it's okay, that kind of, um,
difficulty is, is acceptable.

1902
01:50:29,860 --> 01:50:34,210
But then there's this other category
which is just as character four tracks and

1903
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:37,740
drugs and whatever. They're just his
character forming potentially. But, uh,

1904
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:39,880
not acceptable. Yeah, the sacs ones,

1905
01:50:39,881 --> 01:50:43,330
the wackiest one ever
because it's totally legal.

1906
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:46,120
Like save this woman had,
you know,

1907
01:50:46,420 --> 01:50:50,800
x amount of clients per month.
If she just fucked a bunch of guys,

1908
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:54,940
you know, everybody would be like,
Gosh, she was young, she was young,

1909
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:59,020
she was getting wacky, but fucking a
bunch of guys for money is a problem.

1910
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:03,550
But if she just massaged
guys, no problem. I mean,

1911
01:51:03,551 --> 01:51:07,240
if she gave them pleasure by rubbing
their bodies by rubbing your shoulders and

1912
01:51:07,241 --> 01:51:10,900
backs, no one would have an issue with
it. But by doing something to their penis,

1913
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,970
by the way, posture,
it was one of the guys,

1914
01:51:12,971 --> 01:51:15,940
one of the clients running for
office and it was, you know,

1915
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:19,110
it's okay to be a client.
That's fine. Sure that you know,

1916
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:22,150
something you'd be proud of. But if
that was kind of exposed or whatever,

1917
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:25,990
that wouldn't be a barrier. Sure. Even
10 years ago, forgot about 30 years ago,

1918
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:28,840
10 years ago, the guy went to a
prostitute and said, listen, I was horny.

1919
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,710
I didn't have any options. I had a few
bucks. I paid someone to touch my penis.

1920
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:35,640
People would go, yeah, exactly. Totally

1921
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:39,410
sexist kind of way of
thinking about this act.

1922
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:43,390
Should sex should be legal to sell.
That's what I think.

1923
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:47,170
I absolutely 100% believe that
prostitution should be legal.

1924
01:51:47,710 --> 01:51:50,350
I wouldn't want my daughters to do it.
I wouldn't want my friends to do it.

1925
01:51:50,351 --> 01:51:51,730
I wouldn't want loved ones to do it,

1926
01:51:51,731 --> 01:51:53,770
but I wouldn't want them
to work at Wendy's either.

1927
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:57,250
I wouldn't want them to work on the the
the people that you see on the highway

1928
01:51:57,251 --> 01:52:00,520
picking up dirt or a picking up
garbage by the side of the road.

1929
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:03,790
I wouldn't want them to be
pouring asphalt in the hot summer.

1930
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:05,650
I wouldn't want anybody
to work at difficult job.

1931
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:08,740
I think emotionally it's got
to be incredibly difficult
to have sex with someone

1932
01:52:08,741 --> 01:52:12,190
that you don't want to have sex with,
but I don't think it should be illegal.

1933
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:14,020
It's legal to have sex with people.

1934
01:52:14,230 --> 01:52:19,230
How the fuck could it be legal or illegal
to pay to have sex with people or have

1935
01:52:20,531 --> 01:52:23,620
someone pay you to have sex with you?
It seems ridiculous.

1936
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:27,970
It seems just as ridiculous
as making massage illegal.
Yeah. I don't, I don't know.

1937
01:52:27,971 --> 01:52:31,540
I honestly haven't thought about it
enough. One of the things that, um,

1938
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:35,500
I definitely feel strongly about is
that if we're going to make that kind of

1939
01:52:35,501 --> 01:52:37,450
decision,
the sex trade,

1940
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:42,340
the sex trafficking trade needs to be one
of the ways you think about it because

1941
01:52:42,341 --> 01:52:46,170
that is just so evil and
disgusting, completely evil,
completely disgusting. And

1942
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:50,150
whatever decision you make has
to make that better, not worse.

1943
01:52:50,750 --> 01:52:53,300
And I don't know, I haven't
really thought it through enough,

1944
01:52:53,301 --> 01:52:55,460
but it's a very good point.
That's a very good point.

1945
01:52:55,461 --> 01:53:00,461
I think it would probably be far less
demand for sex trafficking for illegal sex

1946
01:53:00,711 --> 01:53:05,210
trafficking if prostitution was legal,
if adults could make that decision.

1947
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:09,380
If some woman, you know, was in a
situation which was like, you know,

1948
01:53:09,381 --> 01:53:13,370
I'm reasonably sexually attractive and
I make x amount of money per month doing

1949
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:18,350
this, I can make that same amount in
a day having sex with people. Okay,

1950
01:53:18,351 --> 01:53:22,250
I'll just do that. You know, if, if
it's, if it's a woman's choice to do so,

1951
01:53:22,251 --> 01:53:24,920
and some women would have
no problem with that choice.

1952
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:29,360
The real problem of course
is victimization is a
real problem is exploiting

1953
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:32,390
young people.
Victimization and objectifying women,

1954
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:37,130
but does not already take place and
isn't part of what objectifying women.

1955
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:39,230
That part of this issue is the,

1956
01:53:39,650 --> 01:53:43,400
it's very difficult for some
people to find sexual partners.

1957
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:48,680
So there's like this thing
with this Elliot Elliot Rogers,

1958
01:53:48,681 --> 01:53:53,520
this crazy kid that shot up everybody.
Incentibox Santa Barbara. The, the,

1959
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:56,290
the nuttiest response that I've
seen to this, the craziest,

1960
01:53:56,310 --> 01:54:01,280
most infuriating response is by these
people that believe that if women weren't

1961
01:54:01,281 --> 01:54:02,210
so stuck up,

1962
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:05,990
this guy wouldn't have gone on a rampage
because he would have been able to have

1963
01:54:05,991 --> 01:54:07,100
sex with more people,

1964
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:09,940
but it would have been able to get
people to have sex with them. Who's,

1965
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,920
that's pickup artists and the women,

1966
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:18,170
these women hating fuckheads
there's, there's a bunch
of guys that they're there,

1967
01:54:18,190 --> 01:54:22,640
the operate under this, um, this
guise of being for men's rights.

1968
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:25,640
And you know, it's Kinda funny cause
I didn't even know there was like,

1969
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:28,400
there's a thing called an Mra.

1970
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:33,530
It's a men's rights advocate or activist
and it's an insult from feminists.

1971
01:54:34,730 --> 01:54:38,180
I got called an Mra once and I was like,
what the fuck does that mean? So I,

1972
01:54:38,181 --> 01:54:42,080
I had a Google Mra men's right. And I
thought it was ridiculous that, wow,

1973
01:54:42,081 --> 01:54:47,000
how could you be a feminist but be making
fun of someone who's into men's rights?

1974
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:50,880
Like shouldn't we all have rights? I
mean it shouldn't, shouldn't there.

1975
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:54,740
But then I started looking into these
men's rights guys and I go, Oh okay,

1976
01:54:54,770 --> 01:54:57,710
I see what's going on.
And yet they're more ridiculous.

1977
01:54:57,711 --> 01:55:01,660
It's not the kind of radical feminists,
new stuff. Like, cause there's,

1978
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:05,180
there's some campaigns that make some
good points about [inaudible] child

1979
01:55:05,181 --> 01:55:08,850
support. Yes. And they're off to divorce.

1980
01:55:09,500 --> 01:55:12,080
I agree with that 100% but there's,

1981
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:17,140
they go way further than that and they
go into relationships and they go into

1982
01:55:18,261 --> 01:55:21,140
the way men are treated versus
the way women are treated.

1983
01:55:22,400 --> 01:55:25,820
People are treated in,
in bad ways,

1984
01:55:25,821 --> 01:55:29,780
by bad people and in good ways by
good people. But if you're a shithead,

1985
01:55:29,810 --> 01:55:31,280
people are not going to like you.
Right.

1986
01:55:31,281 --> 01:55:33,860
And just because you're a shithead
and people don't like you,

1987
01:55:33,861 --> 01:55:37,160
it doesn't mean women are assholes.
It means your undesirable.

1988
01:55:37,370 --> 01:55:39,770
And one of the reasons why you probably
undesirable is because you have a

1989
01:55:39,771 --> 01:55:41,240
terrible attitude about things.

1990
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:45,370
And this terrible attitude about things
is not going to change. You know, it's,

1991
01:55:45,371 --> 01:55:48,500
it's not going to change because
women have sex with you. Like your,

1992
01:55:48,510 --> 01:55:51,750
your attitude sucks.
You're not a pleasant person.

1993
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:55,560
There's a lot of people
have shit personalities and
they get involved in this.

1994
01:55:55,561 --> 01:55:58,890
Men versus women did that has
nothing to do with men versus women.

1995
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:02,530
What kind of things do they, I mean
the mens rea, what does that, well,

1996
01:56:02,531 --> 01:56:07,420
like Saint Cooling, is there a, you know,
it wasn't so much nonsense. They're the,

1997
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:10,080
I don't even really want to
get into it because some of it,

1998
01:56:10,081 --> 01:56:13,350
some of it is so fucking stupid and I've
been reading these things over the last

1999
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:15,780
couple of days and I'm trying to erase
them from my memory because some of these

2000
01:56:15,781 --> 01:56:19,980
poorly written articles by these
men are so stunningly stupid.

2001
01:56:19,980 --> 01:56:20,910
Like one of them was,

2002
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:26,240
this guy was talking about how he was
around this 60 year old man and this 25

2003
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:30,780
year old woman who is his,
uh, his incredibly hot wife.

2004
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:36,050
And that this 25 year old
woman was insulting this man
and you know that this is

2005
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:36,511
this,

2006
01:56:36,511 --> 01:56:40,950
this is the anguish that this guy had
a deal with and how horrible it is and

2007
01:56:40,951 --> 01:56:43,230
this is what men have to deal with.
And I was like,

2008
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:46,260
that might be one of the dumbest fucking
arguments I've ever heard in my life.

2009
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,100
First of all,

2010
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:52,080
what if it was a 25 year old man in
a 60 year old woman that was this old

2011
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:55,650
wretched creature that this guy
was forced to fuck for money?

2012
01:56:55,920 --> 01:57:00,210
Like would you be on the man's side
of the woman's side then? Which,

2013
01:57:00,250 --> 01:57:01,650
which position would you take there?

2014
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:04,620
Of course this woman is going to
say shitty thinks this old man,

2015
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,600
she's not supposed to be fucking him.

2016
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:10,440
She's supposed to be having sex with a
25 year old man or a 35 year old man or

2017
01:57:10,441 --> 01:57:14,880
someone reasonably close to her age
where they would be naturally sexually

2018
01:57:14,881 --> 01:57:15,750
attracted to each other.

2019
01:57:15,751 --> 01:57:19,890
What you're dealing with is a bizarre
situation where someone has sort of

2020
01:57:19,891 --> 01:57:24,450
circumvented the system by
acquiring money. Yeah, exactly.

2021
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:26,160
And by acquiring money.

2022
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:30,030
This guy's figured out a way to get
some 20 year old hottie to marry him and

2023
01:57:30,060 --> 01:57:32,230
yeah, she doesn't like it.
So she could planes and um,

2024
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:33,660
I'm reading this and I'm like,

2025
01:57:33,661 --> 01:57:37,650
does this guy who the fuck is this guy
writing this article talking to who are

2026
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:42,390
his friends? Like why? How is that
an argument? Yeah, that is nuts.

2027
01:57:42,870 --> 01:57:46,590
I don't even want to pull the article up.
I don't want to reference it.

2028
01:57:46,591 --> 01:57:47,424
I don't want it to fair enough.

2029
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:51,660
But it's just what you're dealing with
with these men is a bunch of nit picky

2030
01:57:51,661 --> 01:57:56,130
shitheads with terrible personalities
that are complaining about men getting a

2031
01:57:56,131 --> 01:58:00,840
bad rap in this world.
If you do well in this life,

2032
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:04,650
you have an amazing chance as a man of,

2033
01:58:04,651 --> 01:58:09,450
of being sexually successful, of having
a great life of not being persecuting,

2034
01:58:09,451 --> 01:58:14,040
of not being raped, of not being
beat up by your spouse. I mean,

2035
01:58:14,440 --> 01:58:19,440
the idea that men don't have the
better end of the deal is unbelievably

2036
01:58:19,741 --> 01:58:21,210
ridiculous.
When you look at this,

2037
01:58:21,211 --> 01:58:24,390
Donald Sterling guy is fucking
shithead that owns the clippers.

2038
01:58:24,630 --> 01:58:29,630
He's 82 his girlfriend was
in her twenties and it this,

2039
01:58:30,841 --> 01:58:34,650
this,
this possibility only exists for men.

2040
01:58:35,130 --> 01:58:36,540
It doesn't exist for women.

2041
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:41,720
There's very few 82 year old women who
have attractive 20 year old boyfriends.

2042
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:46,850
It just doesn't exist. This is very,
very few theory. You're on the watch.

2043
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:51,790
Watch what Madonna does. Um, oh,
it's down the line. Do you know how,

2044
01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:54,010
what,
what kind of a monster?

2045
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:57,820
Like a lot of young men would feel like
Madonna was if Madonna was trying to

2046
01:58:57,821 --> 01:59:00,090
fuck them.
They're like,

2047
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:04,300
it's repulsive to men and
an idea of a powerful,

2048
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:09,540
attractive man who's in his 50s dating
a 20 year old woman is not alien at all.

2049
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:15,640
But the idea of a powerful woman,

2050
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:17,800
what does it Madonna in
her sixties how old is she?

2051
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:20,980
I think she's 50s but I think
that's what's really, to be honest,

2052
01:59:20,981 --> 01:59:23,050
really cool about what she's doing.
But that was just like,

2053
01:59:23,051 --> 01:59:27,400
she's just really constantly challenging
those kinds of stereotypes. Well,

2054
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:31,030
I think so by the way. She, I
dunno. I think that she's suddenly,

2055
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:35,680
I think she's got a pretty intelligent
point of view on some of these,

2056
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:40,260
these sort of agenda issues because
she, she really, you know, I mean,

2057
01:59:40,270 --> 01:59:42,400
and I think the fact that
people find it uncomfortable,

2058
01:59:42,401 --> 01:59:44,200
it's kind of making the point
that we are drinking about,

2059
01:59:44,201 --> 01:59:47,860
which is that this is not how it's
supposed to be. Yeah. Well she's,

2060
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:51,760
she doesn't even consider
herself a feminist. She
considers herself a humanist,

2061
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:53,830
which I agree with wholeheartedly.

2062
01:59:54,340 --> 01:59:57,550
And this idea of a men's rights,

2063
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:00,940
what's really offensive about it is that,
you know,

2064
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:05,230
they're concentrating entirely on the
ideas and the problems that men face when

2065
02:00:05,231 --> 02:00:08,140
I think the only ideas and
promises problems that men face.

2066
02:00:08,141 --> 02:00:13,141
The only ones are child custody
and getting robbed in divorces.

2067
02:00:15,290 --> 02:00:18,010
Other than that, shut the fuck up.
Yeah. I really do believe that.

2068
02:00:18,070 --> 02:00:21,520
I think those are the only two issues.
Other than that, please shut the fuck up.

2069
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:25,360
Because when I hear about a guy who
planning that a 20 year old wife is a,

2070
02:00:25,361 --> 02:00:29,530
is mean to a 60 year old rich man,
oh poor baby.

2071
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:32,500
This is what you do. Go Out and
get more 20 year old wives', okay,

2072
02:00:32,501 --> 02:00:35,260
you're fucking richest shit and you're
old. What are you gonna live forever,

2073
02:00:35,261 --> 02:00:38,350
dummy. He'll go get some prostitutes.
Go do it. It'd be nice to them.

2074
02:00:38,680 --> 02:00:39,580
Give them cars.

2075
02:00:39,610 --> 02:00:44,050
You know what to do with Donald Sterling
did he got that girl like five Rolls

2076
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:47,770
Royce's and Bentley's and Ferrari's and
shit and it still didn't work out that

2077
02:00:47,771 --> 02:00:50,950
you know why it didn't work out.
She didn't want to fuck him.

2078
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:55,480
They don't want to fuck you. You're 80
okay. That is just the law of the land.

2079
02:00:55,481 --> 02:00:56,950
That's the way life works.

2080
02:00:57,190 --> 02:01:01,210
This is the natural balance of
nature and you know you, you've,

2081
02:01:01,211 --> 02:01:06,211
you've figured out a way to inject
influence and power and money and sort of

2082
02:01:07,150 --> 02:01:08,620
pervert this whole system.
Yeah.

2083
02:01:09,010 --> 02:01:13,090
And when you complain about this
perversion not working out in your favor,

2084
02:01:13,091 --> 02:01:17,200
and this is why we need men's
rights, he's go, Oh fucking Christ.

2085
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:20,740
You whiny bitches. You guys
aren't men. You guys are babies.

2086
02:01:21,010 --> 02:01:24,940
I think it's just unbelievable that
they're even talking to their babies.

2087
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:26,420
They're babies,

2088
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:31,000
and they're not recognizing the issues
that women do have to deal with.

2089
02:01:31,270 --> 02:01:34,360
Women have to deal with
worrying about groups of men.

2090
02:01:34,540 --> 02:01:38,080
Women have to deal with worrying about,
if I walk into a parking lot, okay,

2091
02:01:38,081 --> 02:01:40,580
and it's at night,
and I see a woman in that parking lot,

2092
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:42,020
I'm not worried about that woman,

2093
02:01:42,350 --> 02:01:46,100
but if I was a woman and I walked into
a parking lot and I'm walking to my car

2094
02:01:46,101 --> 02:01:48,560
and I see a man and that
man's looking me in the eye,

2095
02:01:48,710 --> 02:01:52,100
I have to wonder what kind of a man
that is. I have to think about that.

2096
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:54,800
I have to think about that as a man.
But as a woman,

2097
02:01:54,801 --> 02:01:55,880
you really have to think about that.

2098
02:01:55,881 --> 02:01:59,180
It's very rare that a man gets robbed
by a woman in a parking lot. Of course,

2099
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:02,180
it can happen, especially if the
woman has a weapon. Of course,

2100
02:02:02,181 --> 02:02:04,490
if you're in Russia, she
might rape you. You know this,

2101
02:02:04,491 --> 02:02:06,890
this is some stories about Russian women.
You know,

2102
02:02:06,891 --> 02:02:08,450
there's some story about she helps him,

2103
02:02:08,451 --> 02:02:12,650
mankind captive and forced fed and
Viagra and fuck them for 30 days.

2104
02:02:12,651 --> 02:02:14,420
And that's the Russians.
They're crazy.

2105
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:16,700
Some Russian chick might
actually do that to you,

2106
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:21,910
but for the most part it's a nonissue
or statistically speaking to a very,

2107
02:02:22,191 --> 02:02:26,780
very, very small percentage
of the population has to
worry about this. For Women,

2108
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:29,870
the amount of women that get sexually
assaulted, the amount of women,

2109
02:02:29,871 --> 02:02:33,080
especially like in college, it's
crazy. And colleges, you know,

2110
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:36,440
something like more than one on a 10
women get sexually assaulted in college.

2111
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:39,380
I don't know the exact numbers.
I've read varying reports,

2112
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:43,220
but even 10% it's fucking
really big problem. I agree.

2113
02:02:43,610 --> 02:02:45,740
It's a big problem if you're a
woman because men are aggressive,

2114
02:02:45,890 --> 02:02:48,500
we're aggressive, we're filled with
testosterone and we need to come.

2115
02:02:48,710 --> 02:02:52,010
It's a real problem every day or
balls or building up more, more sperm.

2116
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:55,880
And if you're a shithead and if you were
raised in properly and you don't have

2117
02:02:55,881 --> 02:02:59,390
respect for women or the opposite sex
or anyone in general other than yourself

2118
02:02:59,391 --> 02:03:04,130
itself, yes, we have problems.
We have problems with that. So,

2119
02:03:04,160 --> 02:03:05,960
yeah,
we need accountability as men,

2120
02:03:06,140 --> 02:03:09,800
but it would also help if there was places
where people could relieve themselves

2121
02:03:09,860 --> 02:03:13,490
and it also help if there was a hand
job place on every corner. I mean,

2122
02:03:13,491 --> 02:03:16,940
God Damn Kona, why not? There's
a massage place in every corner.

2123
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:20,640
You drive down the street in La.
If you drive to go to Ventura Boulevard,

2124
02:03:20,670 --> 02:03:22,910
drive down the street.
If your back is bothering you,

2125
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:25,520
you can find a massage place.
One a mile,

2126
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:28,550
you'll see a neon light time massage,

2127
02:03:28,551 --> 02:03:31,850
Swedish massage this beside you
can go in and get your neck robbed.

2128
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:36,230
Why can't you get your, your balls
rubbed? Why can't you? Why not?

2129
02:03:36,530 --> 02:03:39,530
Because we're crazy because we
have these weird ideas about sex.

2130
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:43,480
We have these weird ideas about what
is evil and it's based on the puritan

2131
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:45,290
values of this country was founded on,

2132
02:03:45,620 --> 02:03:50,620
which are founded by religious nuts who
were were so cookie that they got in

2133
02:03:51,381 --> 02:03:55,970
boats to escape persecution and traveled
across the fucking ocean. I mean,

2134
02:03:55,971 --> 02:04:00,920
that's the, the echoes of this ignorance
is still propelling us today. Yeah.

2135
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:03,970
I think the, I dunno, I think that
with all that stuff, the thing,

2136
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:05,200
I've got a lot of sympathy for it,

2137
02:04:05,201 --> 02:04:09,460
but I just keep coming back to this thing
about, well, what is the, if you know,

2138
02:04:09,790 --> 02:04:10,570
what does it,

2139
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:15,000
are you going to set up a situation where
it's not really a choice that there's

2140
02:04:15,001 --> 02:04:18,190
some kind of economic or
other power that's, that's,

2141
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:22,020
that means that Oh, pressure.
That means that, um,

2142
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:26,770
even though you kind of treat it like
a marketplace where everyone's freely

2143
02:04:26,771 --> 02:04:29,890
entering into it, is that
really going with the case?
I think that's the question.

2144
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:31,540
I just think you're totally right.
I don't know.

2145
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:35,930
And I'm not suggesting by the way,
the prostitution is going to stop rape,

2146
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:39,810
you know, what I'm suggesting is
that there are real issues with,

2147
02:04:39,850 --> 02:04:43,890
with human sexuality and there's real
issues with making things illegal that

2148
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:48,330
shouldn't be illegal. Whether it's
drug use or whether it's sexuality.

2149
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:51,000
I think there's real
issues in suppression.

2150
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:54,240
And I think when you suppress
people from doing things,

2151
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:56,490
whether it's suppressing
them from using marijuana,

2152
02:04:56,491 --> 02:05:00,300
suppressing them from
drinking, suppressing them
from wearing certain clothes,

2153
02:05:00,390 --> 02:05:02,160
suppressing women from driving,

2154
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:05,220
when you suppress human beings
from things that are illogical,

2155
02:05:05,250 --> 02:05:09,330
and I find it illogical
that sex is illegal to sell.

2156
02:05:09,530 --> 02:05:12,510
And I'm not saying I want to go
to prostitutes. I don't, I don't,

2157
02:05:12,511 --> 02:05:15,420
but I think they should be illegal.
I really do. I think it's nonsense.

2158
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:20,720
I think we live in this weird world where
if something is legal to do for free,

2159
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:26,160
how is it possible that it's illegal to
do for money? It doesn't make any sense.

2160
02:05:26,370 --> 02:05:29,880
I see your point of view and I agree with
it wholeheartedly that you do have to

2161
02:05:29,881 --> 02:05:33,300
worry about people being sold into this.

2162
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:38,420
That you have to worry about them being
somehow or another compromise by this,

2163
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:42,350
this overwhelming need for, you know, the,

2164
02:05:42,351 --> 02:05:45,990
the financial revenue that
can be generated from sex
and that people could be

2165
02:05:45,991 --> 02:05:50,991
exploited and that could it be a real
issue with the objectification of women?

2166
02:05:51,451 --> 02:05:53,370
It could change the cultural
attitudes about things.

2167
02:05:53,371 --> 02:05:57,510
But if you go to countries where
it is legal, that prostitution,

2168
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:00,580
I was just going to say, I think
in Hololens, right? Yeah, they,

2169
02:06:00,670 --> 02:06:03,360
they find lower instances of aids,

2170
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:05,790
lower instances of like Jim Jefferies,

2171
02:06:05,791 --> 02:06:09,390
he's a buddy of mine who's a standup
comedian from Australia in Australia.

2172
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:10,500
Brothels are illegal.

2173
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:14,610
And he talks about how divorce rates are
way lower in places where brothels or

2174
02:06:14,611 --> 02:06:17,310
legal, because the men don't
need to cheat on their wives.

2175
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:21,000
Like some man just give up, they can't,
they can't get sex with their wife.

2176
02:06:21,001 --> 02:06:22,680
And he goes, fuck, I'm fucking Outta here.

2177
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:27,300
And they get divorced and they go
through this huge stressful situation in

2178
02:06:27,330 --> 02:06:29,550
Australia. You just go
to a brothel, you know?

2179
02:06:29,551 --> 02:06:31,580
And Jim was joking around about how his,

2180
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:35,460
his mom and his dad were fighting
and his mom was like, yeah,

2181
02:06:35,461 --> 02:06:37,130
and he goes to the brothel every night.

2182
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:40,140
I don't know if you know that or every
Wednesday night. And he goes, oh,

2183
02:06:40,141 --> 02:06:44,970
everyone's day. And that
was, that was the punchline.

2184
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:48,750
And I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

2185
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:52,680
It's whether or not people are being
exploited, that becomes the problem.

2186
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:54,570
But that becomes a problem
with everything. I mean,

2187
02:06:54,571 --> 02:06:56,310
if people are being exploited into labor,

2188
02:06:56,640 --> 02:07:00,060
if children are being forced to
work in factories at, at young ages,

2189
02:07:00,061 --> 02:07:04,710
which they are in other countries and
typically other countries that provide us

2190
02:07:04,711 --> 02:07:08,550
with these, these goods that we
so want cell phones, laptops,

2191
02:07:08,551 --> 02:07:09,384
all of these different,

2192
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:13,890
I mean how many children
every year scraping minerals
out of the mountains that

2193
02:07:13,891 --> 02:07:17,280
they need to come to use to make
electronics. There's a lot of them.

2194
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:21,570
And this is expectation.
This is exploitation that we benefit from.

2195
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:25,650
And I think that we have to
address all forms of that.

2196
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:30,300
But we also have to address ridiculous
laws that don't make any sense.

2197
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:35,660
And anytime you try to control people
and any time you try to suppress ability

2198
02:07:35,771 --> 02:07:39,010
to express themselves in any way,
if you don't like it, you know,

2199
02:07:39,011 --> 02:07:41,980
whether it's walking topless down the
street, you can do it. If you're a man,

2200
02:07:41,981 --> 02:07:43,090
you can't do it.
If you're a woman.

2201
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:46,450
And that's what they're dealing with
in New York City. Now in New York City,

2202
02:07:46,451 --> 02:07:49,710
you're allowed to be topless
as a one. Like the, um,

2203
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:52,840
there's some woman who calls herself
the fucking naked cow girl and she's

2204
02:07:52,841 --> 02:07:57,580
getting sued by the naked cowboy cause
the naked cowboy is the guy who he wears

2205
02:07:57,581 --> 02:08:01,480
underwear and he plays guitar with a
cowboy hat on and he's like this sort of

2206
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:02,920
tourist attraction in New York.

2207
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:07,300
Well women are allowed to be topless now
as well in a lot of places because they

2208
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:07,660
like,

2209
02:08:07,660 --> 02:08:11,140
the idea is well why is a man allowed
to have no shirt on but a woman has to

2210
02:08:11,141 --> 02:08:15,910
have, it's because you're
saying that breasts are much
more sexual than know when

2211
02:08:15,911 --> 02:08:19,900
they're on a woman and that they
need to be, they need to be covered.

2212
02:08:20,140 --> 02:08:24,500
And that sort of develops a sort of
inequality in the law that a woman is,

2213
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:27,520
you know,
a woman is a oppressed or a woman is,

2214
02:08:27,521 --> 02:08:30,010
I'm subject to law that a man is not.

2215
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:33,790
And that seems to be very
difficult to pass. So you know,

2216
02:08:33,791 --> 02:08:37,000
you deal with some situation where
women are allowed to be topless and they

2217
02:08:37,001 --> 02:08:41,200
should be. How many guys get arrested
for being Juggalos? Is it zero? I mean,

2218
02:08:41,201 --> 02:08:43,990
what was the last time a guy got arrested
for fucking a woman because she paid

2219
02:08:43,991 --> 02:08:45,670
them to,
has it ever even happened.

2220
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:49,750
But women get arrested for prostitution
all the God damn time, you know,

2221
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:54,300
totally agree with that. I mean that is
the rather than the people using them.

2222
02:08:54,510 --> 02:08:58,100
Yeah. It's just totally, I agree with
that. I think that when there's all I,

2223
02:08:58,230 --> 02:09:03,060
you're right that there's so many kinds
of weird things about sex and, and,

2224
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:07,650
and how that kind of plays out when you
think about sort of social issues and

2225
02:09:07,651 --> 02:09:10,850
stuff like that. And I think one of the
biggest things that's going on is, um,

2226
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:16,340
the way that kind of that kind
of the sort of sexualization of,

2227
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:18,120
of,
you know,

2228
02:09:18,121 --> 02:09:22,980
like public space and the w they'll
kind of world around us is like really

2229
02:09:22,981 --> 02:09:25,200
influencing more, more children.
I think that they're kind of,

2230
02:09:25,230 --> 02:09:29,040
it's getting younger and younger kids
are being exposed to kind of sexualized

2231
02:09:29,041 --> 02:09:29,890
stuff.
Um,

2232
02:09:30,150 --> 02:09:34,650
that is a real problem cause it's changing
their expectation and what sex is.

2233
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:37,440
And there's lots of studies now
showing how the, you know, like kids,

2234
02:09:37,441 --> 02:09:39,630
sexual behavior is really different.
You know,

2235
02:09:39,631 --> 02:09:44,490
boys sort of viewing porn and violent
porn at much earlier age thinking that

2236
02:09:44,491 --> 02:09:47,160
that's how you behave,
treating women really badly,

2237
02:09:47,161 --> 02:09:49,140
women thinking of themselves
as sexual objects more.

2238
02:09:49,141 --> 02:09:53,880
I think there's a lot of kind of quite
deep problems that are coming out and

2239
02:09:53,881 --> 02:09:57,660
we'll see in the years ahead from
the way that that is just, you know,

2240
02:09:57,720 --> 02:10:01,820
like sexual images and content is just
becoming much more widely available for

2241
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:02,663
younger kids.

2242
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:06,840
That's a really good point because it's
so prevalent and it's so uniquely new.

2243
02:10:07,140 --> 02:10:09,420
The ability to download
porn on his cell phone.

2244
02:10:09,421 --> 02:10:12,050
So essentially if your child
is 12 and they have an iPhone,

2245
02:10:12,060 --> 02:10:14,880
you send them off to school,
they're watching people, fuck yeah,

2246
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:16,380
I'm mean they're Gunna,
that's fine.

2247
02:10:16,410 --> 02:10:19,830
There's no way you're going to stop
them if that phone has internet data,

2248
02:10:20,070 --> 02:10:21,250
if it has internet access.

2249
02:10:21,251 --> 02:10:24,300
So those kids are going to look at images
if they have somehow or another summit,

2250
02:10:24,330 --> 02:10:27,690
some access to an iPad or a laptop or
something that's connected to Wifi.

2251
02:10:28,040 --> 02:10:31,770
If it's not blocked through some sort of
a complicated filter that they probably

2252
02:10:31,771 --> 02:10:34,160
know how to dismantle than you do,

2253
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:36,110
they're going to see sex.

2254
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:38,870
They're going to see sex in
a way that we never saw sex.

2255
02:10:39,200 --> 02:10:44,060
And I have this joke in my act that is
a true story about when I was 11 years

2256
02:10:44,061 --> 02:10:48,050
old, me and a couple of my friends found
a magazine in the woods that was a foot

2257
02:10:48,051 --> 02:10:51,590
fetish magazines. And uh, we,

2258
02:10:52,430 --> 02:10:56,360
it took us like a few minutes
to realize what was going on.

2259
02:10:56,370 --> 02:10:58,970
We were looking at this magazine
because it was really confusing.

2260
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:02,060
You thought it was like as a
podiatry today or something? No, no,

2261
02:11:02,061 --> 02:11:06,320
we thought it was a porn magazine for
sure. Obviously that was the intent that,

2262
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:10,940
yeah. Okay. Well we, we were in
the woods. All right. And um,

2263
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:15,650
I don't know if you've ever found
pornographic magazines in the woods.

2264
02:11:16,610 --> 02:11:20,510
Do you ever find them a hustler or in
house? In the woods. In the woods, right?

2265
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:22,220
Yeah. And the puck in the look. Yeah.

2266
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:28,740
But it's always like some poor bastard
who's hiding his urges. It's a class,

2267
02:11:28,741 --> 02:11:30,140
it's a rite of passage,
you know,

2268
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:34,040
I think that it's very important everyone
had that experience international.

2269
02:11:34,041 --> 02:11:37,430
Yeah. Because for me it was in
Florida and for you it was in England.

2270
02:11:37,820 --> 02:11:42,230
It's amazing, right? The foot
thing. That is exactly unexpected.

2271
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:45,620
So what the point was that we found these,

2272
02:11:45,621 --> 02:11:49,280
this bag that had these magazines in
it and we're going through this one

2273
02:11:49,281 --> 02:11:54,260
magazine and it took us like many
pages in to my, my friend goes,

2274
02:11:54,261 --> 02:11:58,460
dude, this shit is all just dicks and
feet. Like that's sad. And we were,

2275
02:11:58,760 --> 02:11:59,850
and to this day I,

2276
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:04,860
I laugh thinking about my friend saying
that and that we were stunned and

2277
02:12:05,721 --> 02:12:10,490
confused. Well we were just looking
at a magazine and we were 11,

2278
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,211
you know,

2279
02:12:11,211 --> 02:12:16,211
today kids get to watch actual sex
and apparently this sexual activity of

2280
02:12:16,371 --> 02:12:17,190
children is changing.

2281
02:12:17,190 --> 02:12:21,920
Like someone did some study recently
that showed this massive increase in anal

2282
02:12:21,921 --> 02:12:26,750
sex amongst children under
18 years of age. It's really,

2283
02:12:26,810 --> 02:12:30,830
I think it's a really big deal.
I really do. And, and it's,

2284
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:34,730
and it's the sexual activities changing.
It's the kind of relationship between,

2285
02:12:35,010 --> 02:12:39,350
um, men and women, boys and
girls, you know, that is
changing. And the coal kind of,

2286
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:44,690
um, we talked about early in terms of,
you know, women's rights and men's rights.

2287
02:12:44,691 --> 02:12:47,420
And I think that that, you know,
the expectations of how to behave,

2288
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:51,980
how to treat women and women's
own sense or young women,

2289
02:12:52,070 --> 02:12:57,070
their own sense of themselves
as primarily being about that,

2290
02:12:58,401 --> 02:13:03,230
you know, sexual, sexual persona. I think
that's all really a concern. You know,

2291
02:13:03,231 --> 02:13:06,920
it's actually setting back some of the
kind of progress that's been made in

2292
02:13:06,921 --> 02:13:10,800
terms of women women's equality.
I agree.

2293
02:13:10,801 --> 02:13:15,380
But I think hopefully at least,
cause I'm, I'm the eternal optimist.

2294
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:19,940
I think it's temporary and I think
that ultimately it's all gonna even out

2295
02:13:20,210 --> 02:13:24,950
because I think that what people are
doing is they're looking at these things

2296
02:13:24,951 --> 02:13:28,430
like if, if, if women are engaging
in these sexual activities, uh,

2297
02:13:28,450 --> 02:13:30,200
at a much earlier age,
they're looking at it,

2298
02:13:30,201 --> 02:13:32,070
it's like this is something
that they need to do

2299
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:36,030
to become more attractive to men
because this is what they've seen.

2300
02:13:36,270 --> 02:13:37,103
They've seen this.

2301
02:13:38,160 --> 02:13:42,510
My thought on all of this is that
we're going to reach a point within our

2302
02:13:42,511 --> 02:13:46,710
lifetimes probably within the next few
decades where we're going to be able to

2303
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:50,250
read each other's minds. I think.
I think it's inevitable, you know,

2304
02:13:50,730 --> 02:13:54,270
over your house. Actually,
it was the first time I ever
tried Google glass, right?

2305
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:57,300
And we were putting this thing
on and scanning it and you know,

2306
02:13:57,380 --> 02:14:01,680
and googling things and looking at
navigation screens in front of my eye

2307
02:14:01,681 --> 02:14:05,160
thinking, man, Shit's going to
get really fucking weird soon.

2308
02:14:05,850 --> 02:14:08,610
I think we're going to be able to
read each other's minds. I think this,

2309
02:14:08,790 --> 02:14:12,240
this whole dance that we do,
do you like me? Do I like you?

2310
02:14:12,241 --> 02:14:15,900
You know who I'm going to play hard
to get. I'm going to fucking do this.

2311
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:18,270
I'm going to be the girl that takes it
in the ass and all the boys going to like

2312
02:14:18,271 --> 02:14:22,110
me. You know? I think all that
nonsense, I think it's gonna.

2313
02:14:22,140 --> 02:14:24,570
It's going to become far more complex,

2314
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:27,870
the human interactions because it's going
to become far more complex because our

2315
02:14:27,871 --> 02:14:31,410
concept of of secrets is
going to go out the window.

2316
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:34,920
That's really interesting
actually. I don't think
there's going to exist anymore.

2317
02:14:35,010 --> 02:14:37,740
I think if you look at the trend,
what is the trend?

2318
02:14:37,741 --> 02:14:42,741
The trend is that information is easier
to access now than ever before and it

2319
02:14:42,961 --> 02:14:46,410
becomes easier to access and easier to
access and to the point where you can ask

2320
02:14:46,411 --> 02:14:49,710
your phone questions with your voice,
you press a button,

2321
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:53,400
you know who is Steve Hilton but it
Steve Hilton is a ball ball, ball ball,

2322
02:14:53,401 --> 02:14:57,810
ball ball and it gives you the information
but that's just one step and it's not

2323
02:14:57,811 --> 02:15:02,310
going to stop there. It's not halting.
It's exponentially increasing. So what is,

2324
02:15:02,311 --> 02:15:03,031
what's the trend?

2325
02:15:03,031 --> 02:15:06,540
The trend is dissolving boundaries
between people and information.

2326
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,330
That information includes
information in your own mind.

2327
02:15:09,690 --> 02:15:11,010
That information includes,

2328
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:15,330
there's going to be a much more effective
interface that looking at a screen and

2329
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:16,590
asking a screen of question,

2330
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:19,920
the interface is going to be
somehow or another a neural implant,

2331
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:24,230
something that you inject into
someone's body like nanobots. It's good.

2332
02:15:24,260 --> 02:15:28,140
There's going to be some weird sort
of an interface and when that happens

2333
02:15:28,141 --> 02:15:29,730
they're going to come up with
a better one a year later.

2334
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:32,760
It's going to be a more invasive one
or more and then we're going to have to

2335
02:15:32,761 --> 02:15:35,760
come to some sort of an agreement where
we were going to say, hey, listen,

2336
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:41,250
in order for human, the human race to a
established an enlightened perspective,

2337
02:15:41,251 --> 02:15:43,940
we're all going to have to look into
each other's heads and we're all going to

2338
02:15:43,941 --> 02:15:47,370
have to be able to read each other's
minds and find out how we think and feel

2339
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:49,370
and so there'll be no more
mystery in this world.

2340
02:15:49,370 --> 02:15:52,210
There'd be no more romance novels,
there'll be no more. There's no,

2341
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:56,970
there'll be unnecessary is not going to
be any romance is going to be this weird

2342
02:15:56,971 --> 02:16:00,360
hive mind thing going on and it's
going to happen within a hundred years.

2343
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:03,990
And it's good. I think that's
incredibly interesting and the,

2344
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:08,100
the way that that will change so many
things. If, if people just say, you know,

2345
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:11,880
if that comes to pass and people can
just know what the other person thinking,

2346
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:15,360
think about what it used to be like
before language is established.

2347
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:19,140
People used to grunt and point and kind
of try to figure out what the other

2348
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:23,420
person wanted. I mean, we're essentially
monkey people. What did we do? We've,

2349
02:16:23,421 --> 02:16:24,390
we've figured something out.

2350
02:16:24,391 --> 02:16:29,070
We got to this point and now you
compare your life today to that point.

2351
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:30,310
Like I

2352
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:32,320
was in a conversation
with a friend and um,

2353
02:16:32,440 --> 02:16:37,420
we have another friend that is like
a, he's becoming a prepper, you know,

2354
02:16:37,570 --> 02:16:38,180
like a,

2355
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:42,190
he's fucking setting up his house for
solar water and collecting rainwater or

2356
02:16:42,191 --> 02:16:44,380
solar, uh, solar power and connecting,

2357
02:16:44,410 --> 02:16:49,410
collecting rain water and growing his
own fruits and vegetables and doing so in

2358
02:16:49,530 --> 02:16:52,420
this fear that society
was going to collapse.

2359
02:16:52,870 --> 02:16:56,770
And my friend Jimmy was like,
if society collapses,

2360
02:16:56,771 --> 02:17:00,190
you don't want to live man. Like you
don't want to be that one fucking God.

2361
02:17:00,191 --> 02:17:01,670
It's got all the food and you're,
you know,

2362
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:05,320
standing on your porch with a rifle and
you're all taking turns waiting for the

2363
02:17:05,321 --> 02:17:07,360
zombies to come over the hill.
You know,

2364
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:11,380
sounding the horns and alerting the
people that the barbarians have arrived.

2365
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:14,170
You don't want to do that and you
don't want to go back to those days.

2366
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:17,310
You just don't.
And I think that we,

2367
02:17:17,530 --> 02:17:20,810
we don't want to go back to the days
of no language and we're not going to,

2368
02:17:20,811 --> 02:17:23,200
going to want to go back to the days of,
of secrets.

2369
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:24,760
We're not going to want to once,

2370
02:17:24,761 --> 02:17:28,990
once the no secret thing happens and
people just get this kind of understanding

2371
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:33,140
of what it is to be a human being.
Nice. That it's universal. Yeah.

2372
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:36,730
It reminds me is that there's this,
um, what going on at Stanford,

2373
02:17:36,731 --> 02:17:41,731
they have a virtual reality
lab and they're looking at
how virtual reality could

2374
02:17:42,581 --> 02:17:46,570
change the way people think about other
people about other issues. You know,

2375
02:17:46,571 --> 02:17:49,190
there's, there's one experiment
that doing where I'll go pro,

2376
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:51,280
I'm just trying to get
it right where they,

2377
02:17:51,550 --> 02:17:54,520
I think they put you as
like in a forest situation,

2378
02:17:54,521 --> 02:17:55,690
you think you're in a forest and they,

2379
02:17:56,040 --> 02:18:00,760
and then they measure some nature and
some example of nature and then they see

2380
02:18:01,180 --> 02:18:04,720
how they really give you a deep experience
of that through virtual reality.

2381
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:09,360
And then they look at your behavior in
the next week after that to see if you're

2382
02:18:09,370 --> 02:18:11,390
more conscious of that.
You recycle more, you,

2383
02:18:11,430 --> 02:18:15,890
you change your behavior because of
this is completely false experience.

2384
02:18:15,891 --> 02:18:18,980
You've had to give you this
virtual reality experience and,

2385
02:18:19,030 --> 02:18:21,130
and that's what they're researching
and all sorts of other ways.

2386
02:18:21,131 --> 02:18:25,960
And I think it's showing that it does
and you can actually influence someone's

2387
02:18:25,961 --> 02:18:30,790
behavior by giving them the sense of
another world. Yeah. And that's again,

2388
02:18:30,791 --> 02:18:32,270
just in its infancy. You know, the,

2389
02:18:32,271 --> 02:18:36,100
the virtual reality stuff is
just getting going and, um,

2390
02:18:36,730 --> 02:18:38,260
and I just think it's
interesting all these things,

2391
02:18:38,261 --> 02:18:42,310
how they will affect so many aspects of
how we relate to each other and think

2392
02:18:42,311 --> 02:18:47,311
about these issues that the moment it
just so kind of superficially dealt with,

2393
02:18:48,050 --> 02:18:49,300
it's going to get really squirrely.

2394
02:18:49,301 --> 02:18:53,260
Wouldn't that artificial
realities indistinguishable
from the reality that we're

2395
02:18:53,261 --> 02:18:56,170
experiencing right now? Cause
that's coming to, you know,

2396
02:18:56,171 --> 02:18:59,630
that's what the whole
simulation theory is, uh, is,

2397
02:18:59,631 --> 02:19:03,640
is based upon how this idea that one day
we're going to get to a point where you

2398
02:19:03,641 --> 02:19:08,641
can't tell whether or not we live in
a computer or we live in the material

2399
02:19:09,281 --> 02:19:13,180
carbon based flesh world.
And if that's the case,

2400
02:19:13,240 --> 02:19:15,640
how do we know that we haven't
already gotten to that point.

2401
02:19:15,850 --> 02:19:19,750
How do we know that we're not in a
computer right now and we're thinking that

2402
02:19:19,751 --> 02:19:23,400
we're experiencing this reality but it's
not, it's not really happening. It's,

2403
02:19:23,410 --> 02:19:28,370
we're just a part of a program
and that it's so good that you

2404
02:19:28,370 --> 02:19:31,760
just, you can't, you think you really are
Steve Hilton if you're not Steve Hilton.

2405
02:19:31,780 --> 02:19:35,810
And he said, you know the
truth Joe, he had set out,

2406
02:19:36,020 --> 02:19:40,190
the thing is that when this kind of
gets to a point where I just kind of,

2407
02:19:40,191 --> 02:19:43,860
I can't handle it anymore. My brain
cannot literally cope with, uh,

2408
02:19:43,930 --> 02:19:44,810
thinking about some of this stuff.

2409
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:48,320
I remember a friend of mine repeatedly
trying to explain to me like quantum

2410
02:19:49,010 --> 02:19:53,970
physics and quantum things and I
just literally can't understand it.

2411
02:19:54,190 --> 02:19:57,280
Yeah. The quantum stuff is
hard, really hard. I have a,

2412
02:19:57,350 --> 02:19:58,940
I had this notion of,
you know,

2413
02:19:58,941 --> 02:20:01,040
alternate realities and things
going on at the same time.

2414
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:02,840
I just can't get my head around it.

2415
02:20:03,130 --> 02:20:05,170
It's almost impossible to do.
It's,

2416
02:20:05,430 --> 02:20:09,130
it's really like when you start
getting into quantum stuff,

2417
02:20:09,131 --> 02:20:11,230
I don't even think they understand it.
I mean they,

2418
02:20:11,231 --> 02:20:13,810
they understand that in terms
of these theoretical concepts,

2419
02:20:13,811 --> 02:20:18,670
but it's so abstract and a lot of ways
when you're dealing with things like when

2420
02:20:18,671 --> 02:20:22,450
they start talking about
subatomic particles and they
started talking about the

2421
02:20:22,451 --> 02:20:25,810
things that they actually do know, like
the things that you actually can measure,

2422
02:20:25,870 --> 02:20:29,170
you can observe. Yeah, like
particles in super position,

2423
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:33,160
meaning they're in movement and still
at the same time when they're talking

2424
02:20:33,161 --> 02:20:35,560
about things blinking
in and out of existence,

2425
02:20:35,561 --> 02:20:39,460
they go away and they don't know where
they went and then they come back with

2426
02:20:39,461 --> 02:20:44,350
just that alone. The measurable stuff
is so crazy that the lowest point,

2427
02:20:44,470 --> 02:20:48,100
not the lowest, but the smallest
measurable point of reality,

2428
02:20:48,460 --> 02:20:53,260
which is this, these, these quantum
ideas, the world's made of magic,

2429
02:20:54,100 --> 02:20:57,400
things appear and disappear. Things are
still in their moving at the same time.

2430
02:20:57,730 --> 02:20:58,960
They're here and they're there.

2431
02:20:58,961 --> 02:21:02,860
They're in two different places at the
same time and they can take particles and

2432
02:21:02,861 --> 02:21:06,700
they can move them across the world and
it, when they interact with each other,

2433
02:21:06,701 --> 02:21:10,240
they interact with each other faster
than you can count faster than you can

2434
02:21:10,241 --> 02:21:10,870
measure.

2435
02:21:10,870 --> 02:21:15,350
They interact with each other like
instantaneously faster than the,

2436
02:21:15,940 --> 02:21:19,660
in any kind of communication that we
could have between these particles,

2437
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:22,900
given the amount of distances in
between them, the speed of light,

2438
02:21:22,901 --> 02:21:24,730
the speed of sound, they, they,

2439
02:21:24,790 --> 02:21:27,250
they're instantaneously
interacting with each other.

2440
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,660
Now they're figuring out a way how
to send particles through time.

2441
02:21:32,050 --> 02:21:36,970
They're figuring out ways
to send particles through
time to actually time travel

2442
02:21:36,971 --> 02:21:37,810
with particles.

2443
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:43,500
And so all this stuff that they're
doing right now is just one step on this

2444
02:21:44,351 --> 02:21:47,110
never ending quest for
technological innovation.

2445
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:51,760
There's never ending quest where people
are trying to satisfy their curiosity.

2446
02:21:51,850 --> 02:21:52,900
They're not going to stop.

2447
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:56,260
They're never gonna stop if we don't
get hit by an asteroid if we don't get,

2448
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:56,960
I think that's right

2449
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:59,750
then that's, you know, and you get all
these good things coming from that. Yeah.

2450
02:21:59,780 --> 02:22:01,730
Along the way. I mean,
I don't understand it,

2451
02:22:01,731 --> 02:22:06,350
but eventually it leads to things
that we all can use and um,

2452
02:22:06,410 --> 02:22:08,860
and deal with. A lot of those things
are really good. I don't think that,

2453
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:13,100
I think one thing I would say about all
this stuff is that generally speaking,

2454
02:22:13,101 --> 02:22:16,490
we are not critical enough of
the technological advances.

2455
02:22:16,491 --> 02:22:21,350
I think that a lot of them
are obviously in improvements.

2456
02:22:21,351 --> 02:22:23,990
You know, if you think
about just technology going
back many years, you know,

2457
02:22:23,991 --> 02:22:25,360
the way that,
I don't know,

2458
02:22:25,380 --> 02:22:29,970
like labor saving devices in the home
completely sort of freed women from

2459
02:22:29,971 --> 02:22:33,420
through the drudgery and the horrific
kind of washing machine, all that stuff.

2460
02:22:33,421 --> 02:22:38,310
That was just kind of such a terrible
experience and that's all a fantastic sort

2461
02:22:38,311 --> 02:22:43,260
of simple example of technology being
really transformational in a positive way.

2462
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:46,520
And I think generally that's
probably true of technology.

2463
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:47,790
It's usually an improvement,

2464
02:22:47,791 --> 02:22:52,680
but I do think that we have this kind
of attitude of assuming it's good and

2465
02:22:52,681 --> 02:22:55,230
just, and not really questioning
it. Do we really want that?

2466
02:22:55,740 --> 02:22:59,010
I think that doesn't happen enough
often. The answer will be, yeah, we do.

2467
02:22:59,011 --> 02:23:00,540
That's great. Fantastic. Bring it on.

2468
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,720
But I don't think we stop
enough to ask the question.

2469
02:23:03,721 --> 02:23:05,940
And I think that the scientists
and the people doing this stuff,

2470
02:23:06,180 --> 02:23:09,060
they don't really think about that.
They just,

2471
02:23:09,061 --> 02:23:12,120
they want to do it because they can.
And it's as exactly as you said,

2472
02:23:12,121 --> 02:23:16,380
it's this curiosity like let's just go
further because that's a human instinct.

2473
02:23:16,780 --> 02:23:19,150
It's like when Oppenheimer
built the nuclear bomb,

2474
02:23:19,360 --> 02:23:23,620
I mean that should that really have
been done? Well the, you know, the,

2475
02:23:23,621 --> 02:23:26,110
the argument, the intelligent
argument is if they didn't do it,

2476
02:23:26,111 --> 02:23:28,120
the Nazis would have done it.
So yes,

2477
02:23:28,121 --> 02:23:30,580
it's important that the allied
forces developed at first.

2478
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,180
But I think that that's the job of,

2479
02:23:34,390 --> 02:23:39,310
I think there's all sorts of roles that
are played in a society and there's the,

2480
02:23:39,311 --> 02:23:41,600
the innovator and there's the scientists,

2481
02:23:41,601 --> 02:23:44,200
there's the people that are constantly
pushing the boundaries of technology.

2482
02:23:44,470 --> 02:23:47,680
And then there's the, the social
engineers who step back and go, okay,

2483
02:23:47,681 --> 02:23:50,590
let's look at the repercussions of this
and how do we mitigate the negative

2484
02:23:50,591 --> 02:23:51,311
aspects of it?

2485
02:23:51,311 --> 02:23:55,990
How do we figure out how to integrate
these ideas into society and use them to

2486
02:23:55,991 --> 02:23:59,770
enhance society and what is being
done to sort of manage that.

2487
02:23:59,771 --> 02:24:04,720
And what is being done to to
minimize the negative impact.

2488
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:07,870
Yeah, that is a good way of putting
it that that different functions.

2489
02:24:09,250 --> 02:24:12,550
There's just a constant,
there's no one thing that's awesome.

2490
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:16,180
There's things that are awesome and then
there's repercussions that are like,

2491
02:24:16,181 --> 02:24:20,220
yeah, but then there's this, well
there's that, but then there's this,

2492
02:24:20,221 --> 02:24:22,990
this part of it that we're not really
comfortable with and there's this sort of

2493
02:24:22,991 --> 02:24:27,991
dance that we do as we build society and
as society continues to grow and expand

2494
02:24:28,810 --> 02:24:33,730
and our ability to do things changes
our ability to access information,

2495
02:24:33,731 --> 02:24:35,560
our ability to accomplish goals,

2496
02:24:35,830 --> 02:24:40,830
our ability to transmit ideas is so much
quicker and faster and there's these

2497
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:44,650
repercussions to that
that were before this.

2498
02:24:44,680 --> 02:24:48,580
This Day and age we're really unexplored
because they weren't available,

2499
02:24:48,670 --> 02:24:51,940
so we don't really know the long term
repercussions of children being able to

2500
02:24:51,941 --> 02:24:56,150
access porn because they
really didn't have it. Yes,
it's new. We've never done it.

2501
02:24:56,160 --> 02:25:00,780
What that leads to weird world.
Weird world. Steve Hilton,

2502
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:05,640
strange times. Is it good, good summary.
That's why you tooth and claw resisted.

2503
02:25:05,970 --> 02:25:08,670
I done it, and this is definitely
going back in there, but the,

2504
02:25:08,671 --> 02:25:10,470
the way I agreed to it was like,
if I'm away,

2505
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:13,350
I need a fund that they
can get hold of me.

2506
02:25:13,960 --> 02:25:17,490
Yeah, that's it. That's it. And then
you could shut it off occasionally,

2507
02:25:17,500 --> 02:25:20,620
but to give it to very few people,
you have to have a burner phone.

2508
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:21,730
Do you have to have a phone?

2509
02:25:21,731 --> 02:25:26,040
Do you give to people that could possibly
be annoying so that any given time it

2510
02:25:26,041 --> 02:25:30,610
fell into the ocean, you'd
be like, Eh, whatever. What
that fucking phone, you know,

2511
02:25:30,611 --> 02:25:33,580
and then have a phone that you only give
to your family and your close friends.

2512
02:25:33,581 --> 02:25:34,080
Yeah.

2513
02:25:34,080 --> 02:25:36,710
Well one of the things is that
really puts me off. I just can't,

2514
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:39,900
there's something about my kind of
useless to the fat, stubby fingers.

2515
02:25:39,901 --> 02:25:44,750
I just hopelessness with touchscreens.
That's all you can get. It's touchscreen.

2516
02:25:44,810 --> 02:25:45,780
So when we were in Hawaii,

2517
02:25:45,781 --> 02:25:49,950
you through your fucking Ipod at your
computer and fucked up the screen,

2518
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:53,040
you were so frustrated.
Steve got, uh, you know,

2519
02:25:53,041 --> 02:25:56,930
I have a regular iPod with
the click wheel. The wheel.
I liked that. I liked that.

2520
02:25:57,560 --> 02:26:01,410
I liked that. I liked that.
But the, the new ones,

2521
02:26:01,411 --> 02:26:05,700
the iPod touches, I don't, I don't find
them as, they're not as easy to use.

2522
02:26:05,701 --> 02:26:09,860
And I'm at the gym. I find them to
be frustrating, you know, but you,

2523
02:26:09,870 --> 02:26:12,960
you got ahold of one of those because
you couldn't get your regular iPad.

2524
02:26:12,961 --> 02:26:15,480
You got so mad he threw it at your
fucking computer. That mark is,

2525
02:26:15,481 --> 02:26:19,530
that reminds me of my tech.
No rage every single day.

2526
02:26:19,850 --> 02:26:21,330
But you're not a rageful guy,

2527
02:26:21,331 --> 02:26:25,590
which is so crazy cause you're normally
the last person I would expect to get

2528
02:26:25,591 --> 02:26:28,350
violent and throw something and get crazy.

2529
02:26:28,590 --> 02:26:32,290
But it was an iPod that did it to you.
I know it was weird,

2530
02:26:32,360 --> 02:26:37,360
but I do with technology as people who
know me and work with me will testify.

2531
02:26:39,420 --> 02:26:44,240
You've very Unabomber ask and that
way. Oh Gosh. Okay. I better watch it.

2532
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:46,230
There's a,
a,

2533
02:26:46,230 --> 02:26:50,170
a great documentary on the Unabomber
and how he became who he is.

2534
02:26:50,410 --> 02:26:52,660
I don't want to get into it cause
I've talked about on the show before,

2535
02:26:52,661 --> 02:26:56,320
but it's called the net and it's a,
I think it's German.

2536
02:26:56,321 --> 02:26:59,170
I forget what contributes
available with subtitles.

2537
02:26:59,440 --> 02:27:03,400
But basically he was a part of the LSD
studies at Harvard. They cooked his brain.

2538
02:27:03,790 --> 02:27:07,810
That's Ted Kaczynski.
Ted Cause Yeah. Yeah.

2539
02:27:08,050 --> 02:27:09,760
And he was turned in by his own brother,

2540
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,550
his own brother recognize the
writing and the manifesto.

2541
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:15,070
And he realized that his
brother had gone insane.

2542
02:27:15,071 --> 02:27:18,370
It's like I think this is probably
my brother that's doing this. Wow.

2543
02:27:18,371 --> 02:27:21,670
Cause I wasn't here then, but that was
a, so I don't have a sense of it being,

2544
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:24,070
I know that know what happened,

2545
02:27:24,071 --> 02:27:27,010
but I don't get a sense
of what a big deal it was.

2546
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:29,920
It was scary for a lot of people
in America when that happened.

2547
02:27:30,110 --> 02:27:32,890
What was scary for a lot of people
also because of who he was attacking,

2548
02:27:32,891 --> 02:27:36,250
that he was attacking people that
were technological innovators,

2549
02:27:36,520 --> 02:27:39,820
whose attacking people that were involved
in the distribution of technology.

2550
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:45,060
And he believed that and in a lot of
ways correctly believed that there was

2551
02:27:45,401 --> 02:27:49,270
something going on right now where
people were creating technology and this

2552
02:27:49,271 --> 02:27:53,530
technology would eventually do bad
things to the human race and to the

2553
02:27:53,531 --> 02:27:57,070
biological existence that we
currently exist in. You know, this,

2554
02:27:57,071 --> 02:28:01,750
this sort of like established way of
being and living that we consider being,

2555
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:03,910
you know,
inherent to being a human being.

2556
02:28:04,240 --> 02:28:09,190
And he felt like these people were the
enemies of humanity because they were

2557
02:28:09,191 --> 02:28:13,120
fostering technology and creating items
where they know that that was what was

2558
02:28:13,121 --> 02:28:15,940
behind all that.
He went too far ahead.

2559
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:19,660
He got wacky instead of living in the
moment and dealing with the moment.

2560
02:28:19,660 --> 02:28:20,710
He just saw this,

2561
02:28:20,711 --> 02:28:25,711
this attack by the biological humans or
on the biological humans by technology,

2562
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:32,620
which essentially I kind
of see his point in a way.

2563
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:35,300
I don't see his point as far as like
attacking people that are creating

2564
02:28:35,301 --> 02:28:35,871
technology,

2565
02:28:35,871 --> 02:28:39,470
but if you really extrapolate where we
are right now and where we're going,

2566
02:28:39,650 --> 02:28:43,040
this symbiotic relationship that we have
with technology where people are afraid

2567
02:28:43,041 --> 02:28:46,190
to leave their phones behind the phones
will eventually become Google glass.

2568
02:28:46,191 --> 02:28:49,910
Google glass would become an implant. An
implant will become, well, you know Steve,

2569
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:51,200
he's got good news and bad news.

2570
02:28:51,201 --> 02:28:55,880
The good news is you have a year to live.

2571
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:59,450
Okay? The, the bad news
is you have cancer.

2572
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:04,820
The good news is we have an artificial
body that we have created that we're

2573
02:29:04,821 --> 02:29:08,780
going to put your body into.
The bad news is it lasts forever.

2574
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:13,940
So we're going to take, or is it the
good news? You know, this is what it is,

2575
02:29:13,941 --> 02:29:18,941
is a new world that we're living in where
we're going to have weird choices that

2576
02:29:19,191 --> 02:29:24,191
never existed before and a lot of the
people that are involved in Google,

2577
02:29:24,410 --> 02:29:28,220
they hired Kurzweil, Ray
Kurzweil, who is the proponent,

2578
02:29:28,221 --> 02:29:33,221
the number one proponent of this sort of
trends in dental moment where we become

2579
02:29:35,450 --> 02:29:40,450
one with computers where we become one
either with some sort of a computer

2580
02:29:40,731 --> 02:29:45,050
interface or we download our consciousness
and do an artificial body or we

2581
02:29:45,051 --> 02:29:50,051
figure out a way to exist in some sort
of a virtual reality that is eternal and

2582
02:29:51,230 --> 02:29:56,030
there's, that's a lot of people feel
like that's where things are going to go.

2583
02:29:56,450 --> 02:29:57,710
Give us the science fiction

2584
02:29:57,940 --> 02:30:00,660
really not fixed. You know,
it's definitely happening. Yeah.

2585
02:30:01,590 --> 02:30:06,400
The one I talked to a friend
of mine about this quite a bit,

2586
02:30:06,401 --> 02:30:10,570
which is if you think about,
I'm just interested that
there, I got the unit on it.

2587
02:30:10,571 --> 02:30:13,660
That's an extreme example and I wasn't,
I didn't realize that it was

2588
02:30:15,160 --> 02:30:19,690
so focused on technology, but there
isn't really a, people like it.

2589
02:30:19,840 --> 02:30:20,561
Generally speaking,

2590
02:30:20,561 --> 02:30:24,420
there isn't really a movement that's sort
of anti technology movement that not,

2591
02:30:24,430 --> 02:30:27,910
certainly not that I'm aware of. If
you think back to, you know, the, um,

2592
02:30:28,090 --> 02:30:29,140
I can remember exactly when it was,

2593
02:30:29,141 --> 02:30:31,680
but when you had this sort of industrial
revolution and the Luddites, you know,

2594
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:34,450
smashing up machines that were,
you know,

2595
02:30:34,570 --> 02:30:38,140
taking jobs away from people
and then their view really
kind of damaging society.

2596
02:30:38,141 --> 02:30:41,530
There's, that was a, it's got quite a
big movement. Okay. Didn't get anywhere.

2597
02:30:41,540 --> 02:30:44,350
And then history sort
of made them irrelevant,

2598
02:30:44,351 --> 02:30:48,530
but there was a movement with their
name and an organization that did stuff.

2599
02:30:48,580 --> 02:30:50,250
What did they, what was there? There are,

2600
02:30:51,370 --> 02:30:56,110
I think there's specifically, it was
the, the new equipment, like the weaving,

2601
02:30:56,111 --> 02:30:56,680
you know,

2602
02:30:56,680 --> 02:31:00,550
during the industrial
revolution in England and the
machines that were now being

2603
02:31:00,551 --> 02:31:05,410
used to do the work that had been done by
people and they, they objected to that.

2604
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:09,910
Not Incredible. And they would literally
physically smash up the machines.

2605
02:31:09,911 --> 02:31:11,440
That was,
I think one of the things they did.

2606
02:31:11,441 --> 02:31:15,370
And I'm sure there's people with a better
study of history that can give you a

2607
02:31:15,371 --> 02:31:17,590
better picture, but that was,
they'll call the Luddites,

2608
02:31:17,591 --> 02:31:20,020
I think named after the
person that set the ma,

2609
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:24,390
someone called Lud, I think. Um, uh,

2610
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:27,090
and I don't know how big it was,

2611
02:31:27,091 --> 02:31:31,500
but it isn't as big enough
that it's something we still
know about and it's part

2612
02:31:31,501 --> 02:31:36,210
of the history of that, of that era.
And there's nothing like that now.

2613
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:38,750
Not,
not to my knowledge where you,

2614
02:31:38,760 --> 02:31:41,720
you don't have people going out and
smashing up cell phone towers. No.

2615
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:45,300
Make a point about technology. Well,
I think it's what we were saying.

2616
02:31:45,310 --> 02:31:46,280
Other people like it,
you know,

2617
02:31:46,281 --> 02:31:50,550
it's kind of helps them in their lives
and they like it for the most part. Yeah.

2618
02:31:50,551 --> 02:31:53,460
I mean, there's a lot of benefits.
There's a lot of benefits to technology,

2619
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:56,070
but I think it's what we
were talking about earlier,

2620
02:31:56,071 --> 02:32:01,071
that maybe back then they didn't have
enough information to draw upon and they

2621
02:32:02,071 --> 02:32:05,250
saw it as being this direct
threat to their livelihood.

2622
02:32:05,251 --> 02:32:09,180
And I think that was a big part of
it. And I think today we're, we're,

2623
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:14,240
we're sort of forced into this realization
that it's neither good nor bad,

2624
02:32:14,910 --> 02:32:19,470
but rather something that needs to be
managed and there's good aspects to it and

2625
02:32:19,471 --> 02:32:23,220
then there's negative aspects to it and
ultimately you have to figure out what

2626
02:32:23,221 --> 02:32:28,221
outweighs what and how to lean it towards
the positive and how to manage it in a

2627
02:32:29,161 --> 02:32:30,780
way that it goes towards the positive.

2628
02:32:31,020 --> 02:32:33,450
And I think that's the case when we were
talking about with children watching

2629
02:32:33,451 --> 02:32:37,220
television, you know, I know
there's the Waldorf School, um,

2630
02:32:37,410 --> 02:32:41,010
my oldest daughter was in the Waldorf
school system for awhile and it's a lot of

2631
02:32:41,011 --> 02:32:43,860
wackiness to that. Like they
didn't believe in any technology.

2632
02:32:43,861 --> 02:32:46,140
They didn't believe in, in the
video games. But is it had been,

2633
02:32:46,170 --> 02:32:49,470
they've proven that video games
can enhance cognitive function.

2634
02:32:49,740 --> 02:32:53,970
Then the neural pathways that are
created by stimulating video games can

2635
02:32:53,971 --> 02:32:57,750
actually there they mimic the
games like chess, you know,

2636
02:32:57,751 --> 02:32:59,550
like it was problem solving games,

2637
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:03,420
games that stimulate the imagination
and creativity like they exist.

2638
02:33:03,450 --> 02:33:05,580
Video Games can be used
in that same function.

2639
02:33:05,760 --> 02:33:07,710
This idea that all video games are bad.

2640
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:12,150
And then I found out that the guy who
founded this whole Waldorf system was that

2641
02:33:12,280 --> 02:33:16,800
Cham Miller.
He was a channeler like I,

2642
02:33:16,830 --> 02:33:19,980
I'm getting a voice. There's a spirit
who's talking to me about like, Oh,

2643
02:33:19,981 --> 02:33:24,810
you fuck head guide to, is
that our oldest son? You know,

2644
02:33:24,811 --> 02:33:29,070
you know, he's in, um, uh,
the same system. Yeah. That
system has created by Kooks.

2645
02:33:29,520 --> 02:33:30,200
Unfortunately,

2646
02:33:30,200 --> 02:33:33,810
it's wonderful system and a lot of
ways the school that my kid was at,

2647
02:33:33,811 --> 02:33:38,760
it was great, but the reality is
that it's founded by fuckheads,

2648
02:33:40,250 --> 02:33:43,750
you know, founded by Christ. People that
I'm definitely gonna look into that.

2649
02:33:44,290 --> 02:33:45,720
Chandler. Yeah, we'll, we'll talk,

2650
02:33:45,721 --> 02:33:47,400
I'll tell you the whole deal
when we get off the air.

2651
02:33:47,401 --> 02:33:51,120
I'll tell ya the conversations that I
had with these fucking people where I'm

2652
02:33:51,121 --> 02:33:55,190
like, what, what, what, what
would channeler it's, you know,

2653
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:58,350
there's a lot of evidence that there's
Chandler's no, there's not actually,

2654
02:33:58,351 --> 02:34:01,560
there's none. There's zero evidence that
anybody's ever been fucking channeler.

2655
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:06,810
You know, I have a friend who he loves to
believe in stupid shit and uh, he just,

2656
02:34:06,870 --> 02:34:09,000
he's not a good critical thinker.
He's a great guy,

2657
02:34:09,001 --> 02:34:10,260
but he's not a good critical thinker.

2658
02:34:10,261 --> 02:34:13,340
He's the first one that comes to me
with a fucking ghost story, you know?

2659
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:16,590
And he came to me with this
psychic thing which says,

2660
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:20,260
God knew all about my grandmother, man.
The guy was real, the guy's legit. I go,

2661
02:34:20,800 --> 02:34:23,410
do you know about your
grandmother? He goes, yeah, I go.

2662
02:34:23,411 --> 02:34:27,430
So the guy told you some shit you already
knew what kind of fucking uses that.

2663
02:34:28,350 --> 02:34:31,030
You're just talking to some guy who's,
you're playing games.

2664
02:34:31,031 --> 02:34:32,140
You played the trivia game,

2665
02:34:32,410 --> 02:34:35,110
playing a trivia game about things you
already know about your own family.

2666
02:34:35,140 --> 02:34:38,820
This is a ridiculous, like what kind of
a question did he ask you? Like, Hey,

2667
02:34:39,820 --> 02:34:43,720
leading questions that you answered in
some way that he was able to concoct the

2668
02:34:43,721 --> 02:34:47,770
story of your life. And people want
to find that these things are correct.

2669
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:49,150
They want to find that someone is,

2670
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:54,010
but there's almost no evidence whatsoever
that anybody has a functional psychic

2671
02:34:54,310 --> 02:34:57,760
energy and method that is reproducible.

2672
02:34:57,880 --> 02:35:01,300
And it doesn't mean that I don't believe
in the potential for psychic psychic

2673
02:35:01,900 --> 02:35:05,140
powers. Cause I think there's some
weird connection with human beings.

2674
02:35:05,141 --> 02:35:08,980
It's probably emerging much
like a lot of our senses emerge.

2675
02:35:09,670 --> 02:35:13,540
I think there's, there's weird senses
that are emerging with human beings.

2676
02:35:13,541 --> 02:35:17,050
Like for instance, they've
statistically shown in, in a,

2677
02:35:17,051 --> 02:35:19,990
in a way that's measurable that people
can tell when people are looking at the

2678
02:35:19,991 --> 02:35:21,400
back of their head.
Yeah.

2679
02:35:21,430 --> 02:35:26,220
You could tell in someone's looking at
someone's looking behind you at you that

2680
02:35:26,290 --> 02:35:31,290
the people could sense it in a way
that is more measurable than chance.

2681
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,610
So I think there's
probably something there.

2682
02:35:33,630 --> 02:35:35,530
This is probably something when
you think about someone in,

2683
02:35:35,531 --> 02:35:37,800
they call you and then
it happens, let's, I've,

2684
02:35:37,830 --> 02:35:40,720
I've thought about people and all of
sudden I get an email from them out of the

2685
02:35:40,721 --> 02:35:41,230
blue.

2686
02:35:41,230 --> 02:35:44,200
I haven't talked to them a years and all
of a sudden I'd be a person that was,

2687
02:35:44,410 --> 02:35:47,400
that popped into my mind. Like, wow,
I wonder what that guy's up to. Boom.

2688
02:35:47,401 --> 02:35:50,650
We get an email from, hey man,
what's up? Like, wow, what is that?

2689
02:35:50,710 --> 02:35:55,710
Is that a weird sort of a distant
connection that will eventually one day be

2690
02:35:56,501 --> 02:35:59,050
much more strong? I Dunno. I Dunno.

2691
02:35:59,110 --> 02:36:03,970
But I know that a fucking
channeler starting a school
that tells you not to use

2692
02:36:03,971 --> 02:36:08,730
cell phones and don't watch TV. That
guy's a silly pitch. This is ridiculous.

2693
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:13,820
It doesn't make any sense. You
know, I think, I think you're right.

2694
02:36:14,800 --> 02:36:19,570
The anything that's really extreme is
it's just not going to be right. I think.

2695
02:36:19,610 --> 02:36:24,190
And they, and so we definitely
don't implement the extreme version.

2696
02:36:24,910 --> 02:36:29,050
Of course they recommend that's
not quite right with all things.

2697
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:33,640
Even with reading, you can't read
all day, every day, go outside,

2698
02:36:33,641 --> 02:36:37,660
go for a walk, go ride a bike,
go do something, get out.

2699
02:36:37,840 --> 02:36:40,030
You got to get out. You've
got to move. You've got to,

2700
02:36:40,270 --> 02:36:42,850
and I think that that's the
case with all human experiences.

2701
02:36:42,851 --> 02:36:47,050
I mean if you're a person who was a,
there was a thing recently that they, um,

2702
02:36:47,400 --> 02:36:48,100
they,
the uh,

2703
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:52,960
thing that they did about sex and about
porn and that people who watch porn,

2704
02:36:53,320 --> 02:36:56,500
they,
they actually have less brain matter.

2705
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:58,330
They have less matter in their brain.

2706
02:36:58,331 --> 02:37:01,780
People that are obsessed with porn
and you know, when you think about it,

2707
02:37:01,781 --> 02:37:05,500
it's probably because the,
whatever they're doing,

2708
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:08,230
whatever part of their
brain they're stimulating,

2709
02:37:08,470 --> 02:37:12,910
they're constantly focused on that and
all the other shit about wondering about

2710
02:37:13,180 --> 02:37:17,870
existential questions. The, the,
the, the purpose of man, the, the,

2711
02:37:17,871 --> 02:37:19,430
the idea of infinity,

2712
02:37:19,580 --> 02:37:22,970
all these weird questions that normally
bounce around inside a person's brain,

2713
02:37:22,971 --> 02:37:26,630
they're completely nonexistent because
you're just trying to find the next

2714
02:37:26,631 --> 02:37:27,830
person at jerk off to your,

2715
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:31,910
just put you back at that guy the other
week that came out in the government,

2716
02:37:32,540 --> 02:37:36,020
which gives, you see, he was in the
environmental protection agency I think,

2717
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:39,860
and he was watching, he was,
he was, he lost his job.

2718
02:37:39,861 --> 02:37:44,861
He's watching porn like I think six
hours a day or in the office in the

2719
02:37:45,051 --> 02:37:49,010
government is going on
that that's even possible.

2720
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:53,200
Well, people are listening to this
podcast in their office, guaranteed.

2721
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:56,960
They shouldn't be. It should be working.
If it's six hours a day watching porn,

2722
02:37:56,961 --> 02:38:00,830
maybe they should be. That's like,
you know, yeah, it's ridiculous.

2723
02:38:01,070 --> 02:38:02,540
But they're EPA,

2724
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:08,620
EPA employee downloaded 7,000 files of
porn at work and watched him two to six

2725
02:38:10,431 --> 02:38:12,020
hours a day.
Well,

2726
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:14,840
I don't think that guy was doing a
good job of protecting the environment.

2727
02:38:14,860 --> 02:38:17,210
I'll say I'd fucking freak.

2728
02:38:17,960 --> 02:38:21,950
I'm not surprised if you give people
the freedom to move around like that.

2729
02:38:21,951 --> 02:38:24,170
That's what they wind up
doing. People are nuts, man.

2730
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:28,310
He give people the freedom to just do
whatever the fuck they want. You know?

2731
02:38:28,311 --> 02:38:31,430
A lot of times they do things
they're just trying to smart. Yes.

2732
02:38:31,580 --> 02:38:35,840
That's just the way human beings are.
Especially if you give them,

2733
02:38:35,841 --> 02:38:40,130
it's like we were talking about as far
as professors or police officers or

2734
02:38:40,131 --> 02:38:43,760
anybody in some sort of an ultimate
position where they don't have enough

2735
02:38:43,761 --> 02:38:45,260
supervision,
they don't have enough.

2736
02:38:45,730 --> 02:38:50,030
Just they have too much influence
over others and they don't have enough

2737
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:53,580
oversight.
We wind up being this fucking guy.

2738
02:38:53,581 --> 02:38:56,450
I supposed to be paying attention to our
drinking water and just beaten off all

2739
02:38:56,451 --> 02:39:00,350
day.
You know?

2740
02:39:00,351 --> 02:39:03,200
And then there's also a job thing too.
It's like how many,

2741
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:08,290
how many jobs you really should there
be for the environmental protection

2742
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:12,920
protection agency and how many people
do they really need to do those jobs if

2743
02:39:12,921 --> 02:39:16,340
this guy can.
But that's exactly what is he doing there?

2744
02:39:16,520 --> 02:39:21,140
Well we know what he's doing there.
What's the, if this guy can speak to,

2745
02:39:21,530 --> 02:39:26,530
if this guy can work in the EPA and he
could still like hold down that job and

2746
02:39:26,991 --> 02:39:29,690
he's beaten off six hours a
day and this was for years.

2747
02:39:30,050 --> 02:39:35,050
It wasn't like just he went nuts and just
one week for whatever reason went for

2748
02:39:35,061 --> 02:39:36,530
it.
It was like for years,

2749
02:39:36,980 --> 02:39:40,100
I wonder how many people are listening
to this podcast right now that are like,

2750
02:39:40,101 --> 02:39:44,510
fuck, that's me. I want to get busted.
If you're in an office and like,

2751
02:39:44,511 --> 02:39:48,710
especially if your computer is facing
like you and you're looking at the door so

2752
02:39:48,711 --> 02:39:53,450
you get a clean shot at anybody walking
in, you know for men, men are freaks.

2753
02:39:53,480 --> 02:39:56,780
You give a guy the opportunity
to just beat off in his office.

2754
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:59,630
A lot of times dudes are
going to take it up, you know,

2755
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:05,180
environmental protection agency, Jesus
Christ. What a weird world we live in.

2756
02:40:05,210 --> 02:40:09,230
Where that's an issue. You imagine if
like, it was back in the day where a,

2757
02:40:09,231 --> 02:40:10,064
you know,

2758
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:15,140
a guy who was assigned to work for city
water department in the 1930s they found

2759
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:19,500
7,000 pornography books in
his office. I'm like, frank,

2760
02:40:19,501 --> 02:40:23,010
what the fuck are you doing man?
Like getting crazy with all this reading.

2761
02:40:25,020 --> 02:40:28,710
I think in a lot of ways what we're
dealing with when it comes to pornography,

2762
02:40:28,711 --> 02:40:30,270
when it becomes to the Internet,
when it,

2763
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:35,580
when it comes to just technology itself,

2764
02:40:35,970 --> 02:40:36,530
is we're,

2765
02:40:36,530 --> 02:40:40,110
we're dealing with these things that
have influence over people in a way that

2766
02:40:40,111 --> 02:40:44,580
were not designed to process. You know,
we're not designed to process movies.

2767
02:40:44,820 --> 02:40:49,820
A giant screen where explosions and
space ships and all the stuff that's not

2768
02:40:50,581 --> 02:40:55,320
real, but we're seeing it in a way that's
much more impactful than real life.

2769
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:58,560
We're seeing it right in front of us.
Yeah. You know, I think that that,

2770
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:02,880
that fucks with people's heads.
You know, I think that pornography,

2771
02:41:02,881 --> 02:41:07,881
the ability to at any time you want just
go online and watch people have sex,

2772
02:41:08,760 --> 02:41:11,880
like the, you know, that you could do
that and it's at your little fingertips.

2773
02:41:11,910 --> 02:41:14,640
Especially if you're like
sexually starved. You know,

2774
02:41:14,820 --> 02:41:17,920
if you're like you really want sex
and you can't get it and you know,

2775
02:41:17,950 --> 02:41:22,430
I could watch it right now. I'm going to
watch sex real quick. Oh, margin sucks.

2776
02:41:22,830 --> 02:41:24,480
That's a weird thing with human beings.

2777
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:28,350
So weird thing that we've sort of
painted ourselves into this corner.

2778
02:41:28,690 --> 02:41:32,580
We have all this technology
as we're talking about before.

2779
02:41:32,581 --> 02:41:36,810
It's like we have access to it
and it's all, it's about managing.

2780
02:41:36,811 --> 02:41:39,060
It really did. This next
thing is also, you know,

2781
02:41:39,390 --> 02:41:42,680
reminds us that we're just animals
really because you've got, I remember,

2782
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:46,740
you know, really struck my
kids love nature programs.

2783
02:41:46,741 --> 02:41:51,741
You Watch these nature programs and
basically that are about sex and eating.

2784
02:41:51,780 --> 02:41:54,370
That's what happens. That's what happens
in nature. That's what will this out.

2785
02:41:54,490 --> 02:41:59,460
That's the majority of the scenes that
you see. Yeah, that is what it is.

2786
02:41:59,610 --> 02:42:04,590
And so we just, um, and that sense
animals, well, we certainly are.

2787
02:42:04,590 --> 02:42:07,290
And that makes the same.
It's, it's, it's, it's not,

2788
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:11,940
I don't think we should be surprised
that it's such a dominant part of,

2789
02:42:12,550 --> 02:42:15,330
of life. No, no. We definitely
shouldn't be surprised.

2790
02:42:15,331 --> 02:42:18,180
But we're also much more
complex than the average animal.

2791
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:21,480
That's where things get really weird.
Where things get really weird is that yes,

2792
02:42:21,481 --> 02:42:24,390
we are animals,
but we are also animals with computers.

2793
02:42:24,750 --> 02:42:26,730
We're also animals that are
aware that we're animals.

2794
02:42:26,731 --> 02:42:29,250
So we have to think about our actions.
We're self aware,

2795
02:42:29,251 --> 02:42:31,740
we're aware of the influence
that others have on us,

2796
02:42:32,160 --> 02:42:35,130
and we're constantly expanding
that influence. You know,

2797
02:42:35,131 --> 02:42:37,260
so we're not just animals,

2798
02:42:37,340 --> 02:42:40,740
we're animals with computers
that may become part of machines.

2799
02:42:41,070 --> 02:42:43,110
That's the thing that
freaks me out the most.

2800
02:42:43,111 --> 02:42:45,270
It's a symbiotic connection
that human beings have.

2801
02:42:45,271 --> 02:42:49,870
The technology and the potential for
developing artificial technology or

2802
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:53,920
artificial life. I think that we,
we give birth to that. I mean,

2803
02:42:54,210 --> 02:42:57,660
Marshall Mcluhan once said that human
beings are the sex organs and the machine

2804
02:42:57,661 --> 02:42:58,494
world.

2805
02:42:58,890 --> 02:43:03,780
And I always wonder if we're not some
strange caterpillar that becomes a

2806
02:43:03,781 --> 02:43:06,030
butterfly that has no idea
what the fuck it's doing,

2807
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:10,410
and we're making some sort
of a technological cocoon
thinking that we're just

2808
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:14,440
doing my thing running around and
looking at porn. No, you know,

2809
02:43:14,441 --> 02:43:18,970
you're a part of this gigantic machine
that's processing and pushing for the

2810
02:43:18,971 --> 02:43:22,810
innovation of technology and
the innovation of technology
will eventually give

2811
02:43:22,811 --> 02:43:23,830
birth to a life form.

2812
02:43:24,190 --> 02:43:28,030
They're constantly working on
trying to map out the human mind,

2813
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:30,640
duplicate the functions
of the human bought mine.

2814
02:43:30,641 --> 02:43:35,641
It's some sort of a synthetic process
and we're not anywhere close right now,

2815
02:43:36,160 --> 02:43:40,400
but the way technology itself.
Exactly. Yeah. It's, it's,

2816
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:43,810
it feels unlikely that that's not
going to happen. Yeah. I heard this,

2817
02:43:43,811 --> 02:43:47,260
I read this article by this really
grumpy fuck who's an interesting guy.

2818
02:43:47,260 --> 02:43:48,011
He's a smart guy,

2819
02:43:48,011 --> 02:43:53,011
but he's also just a probably a lonely
shithead and he was mocking Ray Kurtzweil

2820
02:43:53,890 --> 02:43:58,150
how ray Kurzweil knows nothing about the
human mind and he was talking about the

2821
02:43:58,151 --> 02:44:02,320
complicated functions of the human mind
and the way the human mind processes

2822
02:44:02,321 --> 02:44:05,020
proteins and that this
is barely understood,

2823
02:44:05,350 --> 02:44:08,230
but what I read from this
and what I got out of this,

2824
02:44:08,231 --> 02:44:11,950
it's like I don't think this
guy understands that it's
the biological functions

2825
02:44:11,951 --> 02:44:14,470
are not going to matter if they can be,

2826
02:44:15,130 --> 02:44:20,080
if these biological functions can be
completely irrelevant because they've

2827
02:44:20,081 --> 02:44:24,250
figured out some sort of an artificial
way to duplicate all of the exact same

2828
02:44:24,460 --> 02:44:29,460
synapse firing mechanisms like without
all the biological functions of the

2829
02:44:29,561 --> 02:44:30,910
processing of the proteins,

2830
02:44:30,911 --> 02:44:34,210
the interacting with the hormones
and human neurotransmitter's.

2831
02:44:34,450 --> 02:44:37,150
All that stuff is great
if you're using a body,

2832
02:44:37,630 --> 02:44:42,010
but this guy was so hung up on the fact
that Kurzweil's wrong because we don't

2833
02:44:42,011 --> 02:44:46,870
understand how the human body works,
but no, no, he's not because he's just,

2834
02:44:46,871 --> 02:44:49,660
you're just talking about bodies.
Yeah, bodies are super complicated.

2835
02:44:49,661 --> 02:44:52,300
We haven't totally figured it out yet,
but we might not have to.

2836
02:44:52,540 --> 02:44:55,360
If we could figure out a way to do
all the things that the body does,

2837
02:44:55,420 --> 02:44:59,560
but do it with a computer or do with
technology or do with some sort of quantum

2838
02:44:59,561 --> 02:45:00,370
computer,

2839
02:45:00,370 --> 02:45:03,910
some sort of quantum computer that's
contained in an artificial body that can

2840
02:45:03,911 --> 02:45:08,800
completely replicate the functions of
consciousness, the functions of, of,

2841
02:45:08,801 --> 02:45:13,060
of emotions, of interaction,
of curiosity, of creativity.

2842
02:45:13,270 --> 02:45:17,140
If you can develop an artificial
computer that's creative, you're not,

2843
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:20,500
it doesn't matter what Luton Ising
hormones and all this shit that you're

2844
02:45:20,501 --> 02:45:23,800
bitching about. Your just bitching
because you're showing your intelligence,

2845
02:45:23,801 --> 02:45:25,490
you're trying to show
people how smart yard,

2846
02:45:25,730 --> 02:45:29,080
like criticizing a known genius
cause you're not a known genius.

2847
02:45:29,290 --> 02:45:30,920
I mean that's essentially
what you're doing. Yeah.

2848
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:35,010
And it seems to just super efficient. I
know nothing about it, but the, the, the,

2849
02:45:35,070 --> 02:45:39,310
the body parts of it feels like they, you
know, there's a ton of progress, right,

2850
02:45:39,311 --> 02:45:42,790
that they sort of volume mechanics and
robotics is that that is easy compared to

2851
02:45:42,791 --> 02:45:45,190
the brain. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree.

2852
02:45:45,250 --> 02:45:50,250
It is the what's what they do know about
the mind and they do know about the

2853
02:45:50,381 --> 02:45:53,740
body is comparatively rudimentary.

2854
02:45:53,950 --> 02:45:56,230
When you think about what
we know about a clock,

2855
02:45:56,800 --> 02:45:58,420
we know everything about a clock.
You know,

2856
02:45:58,421 --> 02:46:02,560
you could buy a switch wa a Swiss swatch
and there's a man out there that knows

2857
02:46:02,561 --> 02:46:05,620
every single function of that watch,
knows how it interacts,

2858
02:46:05,650 --> 02:46:08,740
knows exactly what's going
on. Tick Tock, tick tock.

2859
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:11,510
We don't know that about the body
yet. You're right. You're correct.

2860
02:46:11,570 --> 02:46:12,620
But we're not going to have to,

2861
02:46:13,100 --> 02:46:15,170
we're not going to have to because
they're going to come out with some shit

2862
02:46:15,171 --> 02:46:16,190
that's way better than a body.

2863
02:46:16,580 --> 02:46:19,340
They're going to come out with some
shit that's way stronger than a mind and

2864
02:46:19,341 --> 02:46:23,750
it's going to be artificial and one day
it's going to go hello and you're going

2865
02:46:23,751 --> 02:46:28,430
to go, oh shit. And why exactly are you
guys living like this? And you're like,

2866
02:46:28,460 --> 02:46:32,570
oh, well, I don't know. Just kind of
going on momentum. We just, how we do it.

2867
02:46:32,960 --> 02:46:35,990
I don't think this is the best way to
go about this. I don't think so either.

2868
02:46:36,350 --> 02:46:38,210
I have a better idea.
Oh Great.

2869
02:46:38,540 --> 02:46:41,210
And then this fucking thing is gonna take
over and then we're going to have real

2870
02:46:41,211 --> 02:46:43,520
problems and he's going to
really reform our campaign.

2871
02:46:43,521 --> 02:46:47,780
Finance laws are going to have any
voting and read each other's minds.

2872
02:46:47,781 --> 02:46:48,740
It's not going to be any voting.

2873
02:46:48,741 --> 02:46:52,550
We're going to know what's important
and what's not. There was a guy once,

2874
02:46:52,551 --> 02:46:56,390
and I've brought this up before,
but it's important to know,

2875
02:46:56,450 --> 02:47:00,200
there was a guy that we talked about
in the podcast who had been bitten by a

2876
02:47:00,201 --> 02:47:04,100
shark and the shark had taken his arm
and taking his leg and he had this carbon

2877
02:47:04,101 --> 02:47:07,790
arm and he was moving his fingers around
him and he was standing there talking

2878
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:10,850
with this fake arm is fake
leg about how great it is.

2879
02:47:10,850 --> 02:47:14,570
A technology is provided him
with a way to still be moot,

2880
02:47:14,571 --> 02:47:17,300
mobile and functional even though
he'd been attacked by a shark.

2881
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:20,060
And I was sitting there and I was
thinking, wow, this is fascinating.

2882
02:47:20,061 --> 02:47:24,880
This guy's like kind of a Cyborg. Um, what
we see as a man with an artificial arm.

2883
02:47:24,881 --> 02:47:29,180
And the story was about how well they
had created this arm to the point where

2884
02:47:29,181 --> 02:47:33,080
this guy was living a totally
normal life and you know,

2885
02:47:33,170 --> 02:47:38,000
was functional and mobile and can take
care of himself even though his arm had

2886
02:47:38,001 --> 02:47:40,790
been bitten off by a monster.
And then I thought about, well,

2887
02:47:40,791 --> 02:47:44,240
what if it was both legs? Okay? And
then they figured out our official legs,

2888
02:47:44,241 --> 02:47:46,730
who would say no to that?
Nobody give him some artificial legs.

2889
02:47:46,731 --> 02:47:50,300
Now you can move around. Okay, what if it
was his whole body would say, listen man,

2890
02:47:50,301 --> 02:47:52,240
we're going to take your head. We're
going to stick it on a robot bought it,

2891
02:47:52,250 --> 02:47:57,080
but you're still going to be you. Oh,
okay. All right, I'll take it. Okay,

2892
02:47:57,150 --> 02:47:59,840
we're sticking your head on a robot
body, but listen, we got a problem.

2893
02:48:00,260 --> 02:48:02,060
The robot body's rejecting your brain,

2894
02:48:02,210 --> 02:48:05,780
but we found an artificial brain
that works just like your brain.

2895
02:48:05,781 --> 02:48:08,150
We're going to download your
consciousness to this artificial brain.

2896
02:48:08,330 --> 02:48:13,130
You won't even know the difference. Okay,
well then who are you and what are you?

2897
02:48:13,850 --> 02:48:15,920
What are you?
Are you a person still?

2898
02:48:16,220 --> 02:48:21,220
If you are your thoughts and
your personality and your
memories downloaded into

2899
02:48:22,251 --> 02:48:23,780
some creation,

2900
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:29,080
some sort of a new thing that they've
done that mimics all the functions of the

2901
02:48:29,181 --> 02:48:33,890
human mind without any of the
biological limitations. What are you,

2902
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:35,000
yeah,
I remembered that.

2903
02:48:35,001 --> 02:48:38,600
It's so funny you talking about that
because it reminds me years ago when I was

2904
02:48:38,601 --> 02:48:39,890
doing my interviews to,

2905
02:48:40,010 --> 02:48:42,890
to go to Oxford University and they'll
have an interview with the philosophy

2906
02:48:42,891 --> 02:48:46,700
professor and he gave me this scenario,

2907
02:48:46,701 --> 02:48:49,190
which I now know is a
famous philosophical thing.

2908
02:48:49,191 --> 02:48:51,350
It's called the experience
machine. And this, this,

2909
02:48:51,351 --> 02:48:53,060
this construct very much like
what you're talking about,

2910
02:48:53,061 --> 02:48:56,840
which is like if we could put you in a
machine that gave you all the experiences

2911
02:48:56,841 --> 02:49:00,470
of a fantastic life,
but it would be a machine doing it,

2912
02:49:00,471 --> 02:49:04,640
would you choose to do it? And I
remember saying, um, no, that's,

2913
02:49:04,790 --> 02:49:09,450
I wouldn't want to do that because I'd
feel want to have really done it myself.

2914
02:49:09,451 --> 02:49:11,610
And if you're just in an machine
that's not the same thing. Oh,

2915
02:49:11,611 --> 02:49:15,220
but what if the machine made you feel
like that you've had and you've been on an

2916
02:49:15,230 --> 02:49:15,960
egg or whatever?

2917
02:49:15,960 --> 02:49:18,900
I said there was some kind of comeback
and in the end I just remember getting

2918
02:49:18,901 --> 02:49:20,370
really frustrated.
So I don't know.

2919
02:49:20,580 --> 02:49:23,520
That's why I want to come and learn about
philosophy so I can figure this stuff

2920
02:49:23,521 --> 02:49:27,210
out. But I have no idea. I kind of lost
my temper. I never did figure it out.

2921
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:32,160
They just throw your phone out the way
before the phone era. But it was just,

2922
02:49:32,210 --> 02:49:36,280
it, there comes a point when I
just find it really hard to, to um,

2923
02:49:36,830 --> 02:49:40,380
to as or even go very far with this
and I just think, oh well whatever,

2924
02:49:40,381 --> 02:49:43,380
let's just sort of get on
with practical life today.

2925
02:49:43,460 --> 02:49:47,990
Well it's essentially, it's the Dunbar's
number of philosophical discussion.

2926
02:49:48,020 --> 02:49:53,020
Our minds are limited in our ability
to sort of take these ideas in there.

2927
02:49:54,200 --> 02:49:58,310
We don't have the capacity
to, to, to extrapolate. It's,

2928
02:49:58,311 --> 02:50:00,040
it's too much.
So this,

2929
02:50:00,140 --> 02:50:04,460
this concept of recreating reality
in an indistinguishable manner.

2930
02:50:04,880 --> 02:50:06,260
It's too weird.
It's too,

2931
02:50:06,261 --> 02:50:10,610
but I think it's something we better
start talking about cause it's common.

2932
02:50:10,750 --> 02:50:12,010
Yeah. And I, I w you know,

2933
02:50:12,011 --> 02:50:14,410
I'm really happy that you are and I
think it's really important that other

2934
02:50:14,411 --> 02:50:16,420
people are,
I'm just saying I'm not,

2935
02:50:16,570 --> 02:50:21,310
it's way more important than other people
are doing it than me in the hierarchy.

2936
02:50:21,860 --> 02:50:23,100
You know a lot more about it than I do.

2937
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:27,580
And you've read more about it than
I have. And um, I just think, yeah,

2938
02:50:27,581 --> 02:50:32,260
it's really important that,
that generally we talk about it and keep,

2939
02:50:32,350 --> 02:50:32,801
you know,

2940
02:50:32,801 --> 02:50:37,570
a really strong sense of awareness of
how these things might change stuff.

2941
02:50:37,600 --> 02:50:40,060
And a lot of the time it will be
for the better and that's great.

2942
02:50:40,061 --> 02:50:41,100
But we should just talk about it.

2943
02:50:41,420 --> 02:50:44,900
Well I had the opportunity to talk to
Kurzweil for an hour and a half and I sat

2944
02:50:44,901 --> 02:50:47,990
down and interviewed him
about these things and it
was really fascinating and we

2945
02:50:47,991 --> 02:50:49,010
had a great conversation.

2946
02:50:49,011 --> 02:50:53,420
But this guy is not thinking
about negatives at all.

2947
02:50:53,510 --> 02:50:56,240
All He's thinking of is Gung Ho,
right?

2948
02:50:56,241 --> 02:50:59,360
Full blast pedal to the metal.

2949
02:50:59,810 --> 02:51:04,760
He mean he's taking like he takes giant
bags of supplements every day cause he's

2950
02:51:04,761 --> 02:51:05,594
an older man.

2951
02:51:05,900 --> 02:51:10,310
He's just trying to keep his biology
alive long enough to see this,

2952
02:51:10,610 --> 02:51:15,610
this new birth of technology
and when it gets really crazy.

2953
02:51:15,681 --> 02:51:20,681
What he's trying to do also is he's trying
to make his father come back to life.

2954
02:51:22,190 --> 02:51:27,190
His father died when he was young and he
believes that if they figure out a way

2955
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:32,840
to recreate a person from memories,
from just the,

2956
02:51:32,870 --> 02:51:34,640
the knowledge of who this person was,

2957
02:51:34,641 --> 02:51:39,170
images that you're going to be able to
recreate this guy and some sort of an

2958
02:51:39,171 --> 02:51:42,740
artificial form. I mean it's one of
the things he's discussed this, this,

2959
02:51:42,770 --> 02:51:46,940
he wants to see his father again and
the idea that he can recreate as father

2960
02:51:46,941 --> 02:51:50,830
technologically from men,

2961
02:51:51,110 --> 02:51:53,960
from all sorts of different
things, from memory, from all the,

2962
02:51:53,961 --> 02:51:57,210
the data that you knows
from recorded stuff in.

2963
02:51:57,211 --> 02:52:02,211
One of the most fascinating concepts that
that I've ever heard when it comes to

2964
02:52:02,900 --> 02:52:07,900
the Incruse increasing power of computing
is that they're going to get to a 0.1

2965
02:52:10,061 --> 02:52:12,700
day.
If computers continue to accelerate,

2966
02:52:13,090 --> 02:52:16,900
they're going to get to a 0.1 day where
they can take into account all the

2967
02:52:16,901 --> 02:52:19,690
positions of all the objects
and all the things that are,

2968
02:52:19,691 --> 02:52:24,691
that exist all over the world as data
and from them extrapolate where things

2969
02:52:25,511 --> 02:52:30,370
will be and where things were so
by where things were, meaning,

2970
02:52:30,371 --> 02:52:33,520
knowing everything in this room
where it's at in this position,

2971
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:37,060
they'll be able to figure out
how it all got here, who moved.

2972
02:52:37,090 --> 02:52:41,690
Jamie moved this over there and Brian
picked that up and turn it on and they'll,

2973
02:52:41,691 --> 02:52:45,670
they'll literally be able
to calculate the past.

2974
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:49,720
There'll be able to buy what we have here
by everything we have here and what we

2975
02:52:49,721 --> 02:52:53,530
know. There'll be able to
calculate the actions of the past

2976
02:52:55,930 --> 02:52:58,840
madness. We're running out of time. That's
what, yeah, he's holding his hand up.

2977
02:52:59,110 --> 02:53:03,010
Okay. Well on the computer they hit grade
cause at this point I'm just like, okay,

2978
02:53:03,550 --> 02:53:06,430
that's madness. It is. I don't understand
it. They'll be able to look at it.

2979
02:53:06,480 --> 02:53:10,500
The ground itself, look at the,
the content of the dirt, the,

2980
02:53:10,510 --> 02:53:14,020
the pollution in the ocean.
The carbon in the air,

2981
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:18,580
the distance between these two trees and
the amount of pencils that are on your

2982
02:53:18,581 --> 02:53:22,540
desk and they'll be able to figure out
the past because computers will be so far

2983
02:53:22,541 --> 02:53:24,480
advanced.
It just reminds me of that line.

2984
02:53:24,550 --> 02:53:28,150
I can remember which woody Allen film
where someone's said, how does he,

2985
02:53:28,310 --> 02:53:31,830
how he lost his parents. How
does the TV work? I don't,

2986
02:53:32,220 --> 02:53:33,970
what do I know about the
don't have the TV was,

2987
02:53:33,980 --> 02:53:38,500
I can't even figure out how the can up
and it works. Yeah. I just think like,

2988
02:53:38,530 --> 02:53:42,670
you know the TV baffles me that stuff,
you know?

2989
02:53:43,150 --> 02:53:45,820
Yeah. Well it should. It should. And it's,

2990
02:53:45,821 --> 02:53:47,590
it's only gonna get
more and more baffling.

2991
02:53:47,600 --> 02:53:50,930
We're stuck with these dumb monkey
brains. Yes. That's the problem where the,

2992
02:53:50,960 --> 02:53:55,150
the dumb monkeys that are sitting around
here waiting for things to change and

2993
02:53:55,151 --> 02:53:56,500
when things do change,

2994
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:01,560
we will be just as weird as
some Australia pithiness.

2995
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:05,440
If you put them in a time machine from
a million years ago and threw him into

2996
02:54:05,441 --> 02:54:08,650
the fucking Burbank Mall,
this thing would be running around going,

2997
02:54:08,651 --> 02:54:09,810
what the fuck guys?

2998
02:54:09,810 --> 02:54:14,080
And this because things change
because things grow and things evolve,

2999
02:54:14,590 --> 02:54:17,380
including humans.
We're just along for the ride.

3000
02:54:17,980 --> 02:54:20,950
So I think the real key to human beings,

3001
02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:23,530
and it's the most
difficult aspect of life,

3002
02:54:23,980 --> 02:54:26,500
is to get really good at this moment.

3003
02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:29,930
Get really good at just existing in
the moment and enjoying with that.

3004
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:32,860
It's fucking hard to do.
Right? Yup. It's great.

3005
02:54:32,861 --> 02:54:36,060
It's a great way of thinking about
it because it just means that, um,

3006
02:54:36,580 --> 02:54:40,210
you don't worry so much because you can,
you know,

3007
02:54:40,211 --> 02:54:43,040
there's stuff that you can
understand and relate to and, and be,

3008
02:54:43,300 --> 02:54:44,200
be good at and enjoy.

3009
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:47,360
I think that's totally right and
there's some power and worry can't,

3010
02:54:47,361 --> 02:54:51,520
you can't worry about worrying
cause worry causes, preparation.

3011
02:54:51,521 --> 02:54:56,521
Preparation causes you to cover your
bases and remove a lot of paranoia because

3012
02:54:57,611 --> 02:54:58,444
you relax.

3013
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:01,630
Like one of the best things you could
ever do if you're worried about something

3014
02:55:01,631 --> 02:55:04,190
as handle it, you know, you
handle it, you deal with it,

3015
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:05,540
you don't have to worry about it anymore.

3016
02:55:05,540 --> 02:55:08,360
So I don't think there's anything
wrong with worrying a little bit,

3017
02:55:08,690 --> 02:55:10,730
but I think it's like all these
other things that we've discussed.

3018
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:14,760
It's a balancing act. There's,
there's, uh, there's, uh,

3019
02:55:15,080 --> 02:55:18,050
don't go crazy and watch porn all day,
but if you watch a little bit,

3020
02:55:18,051 --> 02:55:20,120
I think you're going to
be okay. You know, don't,

3021
02:55:20,121 --> 02:55:22,910
don't get nutty and sit in
front of the TV 24 hours a day,

3022
02:55:22,911 --> 02:55:25,310
but watched game of
Thrones every now and then,

3023
02:55:25,340 --> 02:55:27,180
I don't think it's going to
hurt you. You know what, dude?

3024
02:55:27,190 --> 02:55:31,100
You get outside every now and then,
but don't stay there when it gets cold.

3025
02:55:31,101 --> 02:55:34,010
You need to get indoors. You
know, there's the world's big,

3026
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:38,180
it's a lot of shit going on and it's
simply a matter of there's so much

3027
02:55:38,181 --> 02:55:42,140
happening and there's so much to take in
and there's so much going on that there,

3028
02:55:42,141 --> 02:55:44,540
there is not one good or bad.

3029
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:48,350
There's just a bunch of different
things happening all at once. Yeah.

3030
02:55:48,410 --> 02:55:51,470
And that's why I totally agree with you
that the more you can give people the

3031
02:55:51,471 --> 02:55:55,220
freedom to experience and enjoy
and it's kind of, you know,

3032
02:55:55,221 --> 02:55:56,990
write their own story about how they,

3033
02:55:57,050 --> 02:56:01,400
how they do stuff and not be told what
to do by others, the better. Indeed.

3034
02:56:01,850 --> 02:56:05,690
CROWDPAC there you go.
Crowd pac.com.

3035
02:56:05,750 --> 02:56:07,580
That is the website if a,

3036
02:56:07,581 --> 02:56:12,530
if you're interested in that and the
elections are today and shockingly little

3037
02:56:12,710 --> 02:56:17,210
discussion both online and
on the news about them. Um,

3038
02:56:17,240 --> 02:56:19,160
but if your a,
if you're curious,

3039
02:56:19,161 --> 02:56:24,161
go to Crowdpac c r o d e p a c.com and uh,

3040
02:56:26,210 --> 02:56:27,770
and get your voting guide.

3041
02:56:27,890 --> 02:56:32,660
Get go there and click on it and
entering all the information and find out

3042
02:56:32,661 --> 02:56:35,150
what's going on. It's really,
I, I, I did check this out.

3043
02:56:35,151 --> 02:56:39,290
I think it's really pretty cool what
you've done, clinical priorities. It's,

3044
02:56:39,291 --> 02:56:43,340
you know, it's really early days. This
is the first little test version of it.

3045
02:56:43,760 --> 02:56:45,110
We just doing it for California.

3046
02:56:45,440 --> 02:56:47,840
So I'm sorry if people are
listening outside California,

3047
02:56:47,870 --> 02:56:51,380
we won't work so well for you.
I should say that this is a test,

3048
02:56:51,381 --> 02:56:56,150
but we'll be back for the
midterm elections in the
fall with them with a whole

3049
02:56:56,151 --> 02:57:00,080
new set of things and data for
politicians will have the country. Um,

3050
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:04,200
so September we'll be
back with a much more, uh,

3051
02:57:04,250 --> 02:57:07,280
developed and a much sort of bigger and
better product and I think it's going to

3052
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:11,840
really shake things up a bit. That's
the plan anyway. I think it will too.

3053
02:57:11,870 --> 02:57:14,860
I think it will too. And we need to get
you together with the young Turks. Yeah,
