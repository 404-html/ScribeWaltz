00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,150
Hello Freak bitches.
I'm doing everything I can do possibly a

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,830
cryo machine.
Um,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,510
you name a hyperbaric chamber.
Everything I could do,

4
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,970
I'm looking for the edge because 
everyone's,

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,240
they get,
they got a champ.

6
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,260
I'm,
I'm broke.

7
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:13,961
They got money.
They.

8
00:00:13,961 --> 00:00:14,794
So imagine what they got and now I'm 
scrambling to get everything I could 

9
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,394
get.
You know what I need to get to the next 

10
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,530
level.
I know,

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,371
I know,
I see it,

12
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,330
I see it,
I see it.

13
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,580
Any man and I'm me,
like many other people rooting for you.

14
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,340
Thank you.
Oh,

15
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,173
just,
it's frustrating when I see you getting 

16
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:28,434
close to these fights with guys like 
David Hay and then it falls apart to 

17
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,273
sucker.
What happened when they said he was 

18
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:35,140
going to fight you?
I went over to England champion.

19
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,003
They showed me nothing but love.
They seen the true character of who he 

20
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,130
really is.

21
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,710
He ain't really a good dude,
man.

22
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:42,690
He's not a,
he's a businessman,

23
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,280
but he's also like a,
you know,

24
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:44,970
he's a,
he's a,

25
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,680
he's a weird dude man.
You know what I mean?

26
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,880
You,
I shook his hand.

27
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,450
We said we had a goal because be 
grateful,

28
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,221
great fight,
win,

29
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,300
lose or draw for either one of us.
Um,

30
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,850
and everything was set and he did 
everything they needed me to do and then

31
00:00:56,851 --> 00:00:58,700
he just did the,
uh,

32
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,590
he felt he was looking for another deal.
And the truth of the matter is,

33
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,310
I heard this from the inside that he was
like,

34
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:06,870
it's too dangerous,
you know,

35
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,920
that's just the bottom line,
which is what they often.

36
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,100
He's a fairly small heavyweight.
Y'All smash them up.

37
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,780
That was an easy one for me.
That was a layup.

38
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:13,321
I was like,
oh,

39
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:14,610
look at him on one smashed.

40
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,440
And he was scared.
A little steam in his eyes.

41
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,500
I'm from Brownsville.
I got one thing I can smell when you're,

42
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,453
when you're scared.
I'm from the same neighborhood as Mike 

43
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,380
Tyson.
Ready Paul?

44
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,390
I know.
When the man scared,

45
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,360
I went up on him.
Joe.

46
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,070
I looked in his eyes.
I seen his lips.

47
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,720
He was trembling.
He was scared.

48
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,700
I could smell it.
I'll be like,

49
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,070
oh,
this is a layup layup champ.

50
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,590
This is an easy one,
champ.

51
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,600
Yeah.
What does he wait?

52
00:01:35,601 --> 00:01:37,170
He's not a,
it's not only a heavy guy.

53
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,303
I had that one child.
I could see me just snatching them 

54
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,213
Vegan.

55
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,990
I'm eating bowls and cows and all 
dinosaurs.

56
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,120
Straight animal for you.
There's a lot of momentum in your side.

57
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,980
It's just a matter of getting a fight 
signed.

58
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,090
The heavyweight division right now,
it's pretty exciting.

59
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,180
It's not in the face done the big 
fights,

60
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,190
but I'm just saying for,
for Brown,

61
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,290
those people to try to act like they 
had,

62
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,523
they were going to grab the bull by the 
Horn and not be able to come with a 

63
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:10,710
deal.
You know,

64
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,930
they had to.
I think they have a couple of days until

65
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:15,200
we go to bed.
Like if that was the case that we should

66
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,920
have just went the purse.
But I'm ready now.

67
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm ready now.
I don't want no more delays.

68
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,500
I don't want to play with this boy.
Another boy.

69
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,390
Don't want to pay with this man.
This young man with a family.

70
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,493
I don't want to play with him.

71
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,800
I want the bellarine because he and my 
way up.

72
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,810
I understand,
but he's in my way and it's nothing like

73
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,780
people don't want to stand like you 
could call me crazy,

74
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,830
but that's what.
That's okay.

75
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,500
Look,
I my mind and my mind.

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,030
This is like a already written destiny.
I was allowed of shape.

77
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,043
I was dealt and now I wanted to kill 
myself and now I came back with nothing 

78
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:46,950
behind me,
but the people,

79
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
the people's chairs,
everywhere I go,

80
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,990
he's in my way.
He's just like a tornado come and he's a

81
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:53,670
role.
I'm a terrible part.

82
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,623
He just said my weight because I got a 
bigger picture champion all the belts I 

83
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,640
want to people around the world,
all the belts chair.

84
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,360
I want people all around the world and 
be like,

85
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,200
Yo,
here's my story.

86
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,880
I got to.
I don't have a great record.

87
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,620
I've got like six or seven months,
five,

88
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,640
six months.
Who knows?

89
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,610
I had ups and downs.
I've never been considered a great,

90
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,610
but I fought guys who will tell you on 
the low man,

91
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:13,750
he get busy.
Excellent.

92
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,080
Is Louis.
They'll tell you guys who,

93
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,860
who,
who know me or who,

94
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,350
who boxing acts.
Chris Bird.

95
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,613
They say,
you know what,

96
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,960
Shannon never read that.
Never really seen Shannon.

97
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,150
They never really seen Shannon.
I'm honest.

98
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,890
I'm not.
I'm,

99
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm keeping it real.
I ain't never seen me.

100
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,080
They going to see me win this fight.
Get done.

101
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,730
They're going to see me.
They gonna see the real shit.

102
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:31,690
They going to say,
wow,

103
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,660
we didn't know he had a lot of talent.
We didn't know.

104
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,670
Let's go chat,
chat.

105
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,630
They won't see it for real.
This is a lot of suffering.

106
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,020
Pain Champ and a lot of love too because
they're all around the world.

107
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,070
They see them.
Let's go champion.

108
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,780
They feel in the positivity and they 
said,

109
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:49,350
you know what jam we behind you man.
The people should.

110
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,350
That's not happening in boxing champ and
that's,

111
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,523
and that is another reason that's 
fueling me to look at the box and you 

112
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:56,230
look at the state of the heavyweight 
division.

113
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,540
It was flat before me,
champ.

114
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,733
Couldn't go,
was doing nothing was sticking up 

115
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:02,470
division for gears.
Grab whole,

116
00:04:02,471 --> 00:04:03,304
grab,
hold.

117
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,410
Come on.
Champion.

118
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,243
Heavyweight champion of the world.
You're supposed to be the biggest 

119
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:07,540
project.
Sports.

120
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,250
You're supposed to be out there doing 
interviews.

121
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,490
You're supposed to be Muhammad Ali here 
to stay around people around kids around

122
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:13,480
the world,
supposed to know that they had,

123
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,314
which had been the world when I was out 
there trying to campaign and even to 

124
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:17,614
this day,
you ask somebody who's the head we're 

125
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:20,110
championing rural.
They don't even know.

126
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,790
Nobody knew.
Nobody knows now.

127
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,960
And he was a white guy.
Yeah,

128
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,820
but ask them now who's they don't even 
know.

129
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,140
Nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

130
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:30,010
Now you go around and I keep people call
me one thing,

131
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,920
champ.
Yeah.

132
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,000
They say chat when you're fighting.
Exactly.

133
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,770
So that's what I.
that's what I'm talking about.

134
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,990
Bringing back the imagery to the game.
