1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,810
Hello. Sweet bitches. Yeah. You
know? Yeah. I am talking to you,

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,070
dude.
Relax.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,080
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is brought to you by 1-800-FLOWERS,

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,910
Tommy buns. You need some 1-800-FLOWERS
in your life. Flowers. Look at that.

5
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,790
It's got a little, Hello Joe
Rogan listeners. That's cute.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,200
This is the first time we've ever done
the commercial too. They're preparing.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,820
These motherfuckers are there in the game.
I want to flower budget like a hotel.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,490
He should just have flowers in there.
I love seeing flowers.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,300
Flowers are beautiful. It's
a very feminine thing now.
It's a very controversial,

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,900
if you're a man, you go pick flowers and
you live by yourself, you're suspect.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,690
You'd definitely see you're going
to fold under pressure. You know,

12
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:42,360
guys think like that. Sure, but
why? Because they're idiots.

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,820
Flowers are fucking fantastic.
They're beautiful.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,080
They're some of the most amazing
creations that nature has to offer.

15
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,830
What I love about something
like flowers.com or any florist,

16
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:57,831
I love when you have flowers that are
in the section of the grocery store that

17
00:00:57,931 --> 00:01:01,050
represents to me like a
masterpiece of nature.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,560
You know the and the fact that
you can get them delivered.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,370
This is the most ridiculous thing ever.
It's incredible. Flowers are fantastic.

20
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,370
I wish we should all be surrounded
with flowers were just scared.

21
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,600
We don't want to be soft.

22
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,050
Yeah,

23
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,970
and you never feel weird about like if
you go to like a museum or some hotel or

24
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:21,930
some really rich person's house that
has like garden, like well cared for,

25
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,080
you know what I mean? They have a staff
that does their garden, those flat,

26
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,930
everybody stands in Awe,
right? Of like this.

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,820
It's nature's color Palette
running through their yard
and there's crazy flowers

28
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,470
everywhere and no one
feels weird about that.

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,290
Why don't more men like grow
gardens of flowers? Amazing.

30
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,550
We're going to uncover this time,
it's on this movement.

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,960
We're going to get to the bottom of this,

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,800
especially with 1-800-FLOWERS now
being in part of this podcast,

33
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,240
one 800 flowers.com as a special offer
on their holiday arrangements and fields

34
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:57,350
of Europe. It's the most popular
bouquet of the seasons. It's really,

35
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,910
really beautiful stuff.
It's hand designed, unique
arrangement of roses, lilies,

36
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:05,660
carnations, and it's all wrapped
up in a bright red ribbon.

37
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,320
The c'mon Tommy Buns. Look at
that. It's that, that makes your,

38
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,610
your table look better.

39
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,280
It makes me happy to walk into your
house and see that on the table.

40
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,950
But what if my house was all gangster
and every other way that would be even

41
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:19,340
better. Even better fed like I was in
the middle of skinning an animal. Yeah,

42
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:23,780
come on over time to wall of the Ar 15.
So making a fire with Flint

43
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,100
and you're like, just check
out my flowers. Look at my
flowers telling me buns.

44
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,260
Pretty Nice. I let them from one, 800
flowers, my friend. It's really beautiful.

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,180
And you see in the picture,
if you're watching on Ustream,

46
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:38,930
if you can't see it on Ustream,
chicks dig that Shit, dude.

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,600
Just go buy it for chicks.
If not even for yourself.

48
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:44,780
If you can't bring yourself to it,
if you to homophobic or you're too scared.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,620
Are you scared of femininity?
I used to kid

50
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,570
the, yeah, don't be scared.
Don't be scared. homey.com.

51
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,740
Um, it's beautiful. And, uh,
if you order fields of Europe,

52
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,070
which is that bouquet that
we're looking at right there.

53
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,570
I don't know why fields of Europe,
I guess,

54
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:05,710
cause all those beautiful flowers grow
in Europe. I'll have to ask somebody a,

55
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,540
if you ordered them for
Christmas arrangement,

56
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,570
you'll receive a $10 off starting at just
29 99 plus it's available for same day

57
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,320
delivery. So if you like,
fuck, I forgot checks,

58
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,150

ass. Same Day delivery. Uh,

59
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:26,650
don't wait to send this
impressive Christmas arrangement

60
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:30,430
hurried. Or now sale ends
Friday, December 13th,

61
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,760
which is in two days.
What's today?

62
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,820
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
So three days. That's beautiful.

63
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:39,640
What do you feel me? So that's
beautiful. Flowers at the MGM grand.

64
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,680
I was walking through, I saw, I was like,

65
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:43,480
I can take a picture of these
fucking beautiful flowers.

66
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,070
Maybe we can change people's perception.

67
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:49,300
Maybe people would be nicer if they have
flowers in their home. Is that possible?

68
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,283
I think so.

69
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,370
You can also get one that you can download
the mobile app and you can order it.

70
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,130
Um, you can order flowers from
that which is pretty bad ass.

71
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,900
So like on the fly on the, on
the trolley as it were, uh,

72
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,010
click on the microphone in the upper
right hand corner and enter my code,

73
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:09,790
which is j r. E. I'm trying
to get everyone to use that.
Hopefully they'll comply,

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,610
but thank God 1-800-FLOWERS
did it on their own.

75
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,700
That's one 800 flowers.com and enter in
the code j r e on the microphone on the

76
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:22,300
upper right hand corner. Go
there, do that. Enjoy you will,

77
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:25,390
you will like it and it'll make
your life like a little sweeter.

78
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,680
A little nicer spike just, you know,
just a little nicer Tommy buttons.

79
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,060
It's like a pumpkin spice latte. What's
wrong with the order and that just that,

80
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,590
that is something sweet. Just a
little something to make. Make Nice,

81
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,630
make Nice, nice everywhere. Big Flower
advocate guys, the flower advocate.

82
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,960
We're also brought to you by ting.com
a tang is one of my favorite companies

83
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:51,730
that we use here on, uh, on the podcast.

84
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:54,970
And one of the reasons being is I like
when a company does something like this,

85
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,710
they just gave you a no bullshit
cell phone option. Sweet.

86
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,430
Chris Ryan who was on a podcast all
the time, the author of sex at dawn,

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,510
he loves him. He just started using
it and saving them money and it works.

88
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,720
They use sprint a sprint's great.
You could, it was everywhere.

89
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,540
You can get Internet on it and can do
everything he can on a regular cell phone,

90
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:18,310
but you don't have to have a contract.
You can cancel anytime you want.

91
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,610
You don't have to worry about all the
bull shit that you usually get when you're

92
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:28,630
dealing with cell phones. It can be
a gigantic fucking pain in the ass.

93
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,800
They offer top of the line android
devices, which is what I use now.

94
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,460
I told you that's how he buns.
I switched to the Samsung Galaxy note.

95
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,070
Look at this screen.
I got off the apple tit.

96
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:42,610
My friend has it feel it feels
good to be free of the tit.

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,400
I thought about using a windows laptop,
but then I woke up.

98
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,960
I really did think about it is you
can ask him. That's a beautiful,

99
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,520
what's a good windows laptop?

100
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,210
I like changing things up and even
if it's for no fucking reason,

101
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,940
I don't know why, but I do. I
like changing things up. Do you,

102
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,650
do you miss any of the familiarity
of the APPS, ms? A few APPS,

103
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,280
but only a couple of them like
getting on Twitter. No problem.

104
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:11,540
Shizam no problem.
There's just a few of them that you miss.

105
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,560
Just download or an awesome I have today,
but the Instagram one sucks of fat one.

106
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,500
If you're out there Instagram coders,
how dare you?

107
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,690
How dare you try to pass this clunky
android version of a simple and elegant

108
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,930
iPhone APP. Get it to get the
bitches can't be that hard,

109
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,100
but if you want to get a bad ass
cell phone sim, Tim has mall,

110
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,050
they have the note three.

111
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,100
They have the galaxy s four
which I probably should have got,

112
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,140
which is probably the right size.

113
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,560
I think the galaxy phone and the HTC
one which is also very, very dope.

114
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,830
I think that's the right size.
I think that's a little too big.

115
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,020
I think I'm being silly.
I think with that is,

116
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:51,830
is like I'm on the rebound from apple.
I'm like fuck you. So I dated like this,

117
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:56,570
like really blonde guy and I went right
to a fucking African, just dark as shit.

118
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,090
And now I'm like,
I don't know if this is going to work out.

119
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,700
I missed some of the characteristics
of the blonde guy, you know,

120
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:07,520
miss the lack of bruising, you
know, so that's what you're like,

121
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,090
I feel it. I'm on the rebound. Yeah.
If I was a girl, that's my analogy.

122
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,410
That's a big one right there.
Rebounded with a big boy. Yeah.

123
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:19,810
Just fucking tired of your
bullshit. Um, ting is, um,

124
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,250
one of the nice things about
Ting also is you can uh,

125
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,290
bring over phones if you
have them on sprint. If you
have a nexus five on sprint,

126
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,230
um, you just, you can order a sprint
Sim card from them in order to, uh,

127
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,730
bring your coverage or
your device over to ting.

128
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:36,800
So just go to the bottom
of the devices page.

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,720
And tink doesn't sell the nexus five,

130
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:42,650
but you can purchase one from the
Google play store and easily, uh,

131
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,960
bring it over to ting.
Um,

132
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,430
the best thing about it is you don't
like if you want to cancel, like if your,

133
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:52,190
if your cell phone doesn't work in your
house and sometimes you don't know until

134
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:55,460
you get one and then you're like, what
the fuck? You know, at t and t works here,

135
00:07:55,461 --> 00:08:00,050
but you know that Verizon doesn't
or whatever. That's annoying.

136
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,880
Um, if you can't get cell phone service
at work or at school or wherever the fuck

137
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,710
you're going, you're probably
gonna want to switch companies.

138
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,010
What have you tried to do that with
a big company? You're fucking doomed.

139
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,600
300 pay out the ass.

140
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,040
It's because you're not really
buying the phone in total.

141
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,520
You're buying part of it and you sort of
financing the rest and they apply that

142
00:08:19,521 --> 00:08:23,570
to your bill. That's why you pay one
price for one a phone. If you know,

143
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:27,740
when you sign up for x amount of
years, you know, it's kind of slippery.

144
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,060
It's kind of a slippery thing. Um, I
think it's way better to do it this way.

145
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,900
You own your phone done and they
have the best phones. I mean,

146
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:38,280
it's all like once I'm like,

147
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,310
I'm totally done with the idea of,
uh,

148
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,500
being stuck with one company.
One thing that I,

149
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,780
that I don't like about
the apple thing too.

150
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,620
I don't like getting everything from them.
I don't like that either.

151
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,310
I don't like that. I can't download
stuff like he can't save and files

152
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,740
and stuff like that. With this
thing, you can save files.

153
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,690
Like I could save pdf files.
It's an apple restrictive to a flash too,

154
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:06,660
right? Don't they have that big
apple doesn't do flash. Yeah. Yeah.

155
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,800
But this thing does everything.
You know, I that I think,

156
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,330
I mean apples, I think the iPhone
is a pretty fucking amazing. Oh,

157
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:18,480
and if you have an iPhone four or four s
you could bring it over to the tank too.

158
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,900
I phones are pretty fucking amazing.
They're incredibly well designed.

159
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,460
But the difference to them and the android
phones, man, it's really subtle now.

160
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,320
It used to be pretty obvious, but now
it's pretty, God damn subtle. It's a,

161
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,440
it's pretty fucking close and
the distance between the d,

162
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,770
The difference rather between the
experience you get with the larger screen,

163
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
that's a big difference.

164
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,420
The difference between the quality
of them is a small difference.

165
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,510
I mean crazy can't deny apples
build quality. It's amazing.

166
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,530
They make amazing phones,

167
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,460
but the differences in the experience
of having a screen that's six inches

168
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,820
versus, or 5.7 inches as opposed
to having a screen it's for,

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,900
there's a big difference that
that phone sucks up fat Dick,

170
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,150
if you're trying to watch
a movie. Yes, this is,

171
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:04,530
you can actually watch videos
clearly and it looks cool. Anyway,

172
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,380
Ting bitches,
Tei and g,

173
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,470
go to rogan.ting.co.com and
save yourself $25 off the um,

174
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,090
off of your first ting
device when you sign up.

175
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:23,091
So rogan.ting.com and save 25
bucks off your first ting device.

176
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,860
It's an excellent, excellent cell
phone company. The way they work,

177
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:32,250
you purchase your phone,
get it from Ting,

178
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,750
you receive it in two
to five business days.

179
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,370
Then you activate your device with Ting.

180
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,660
You have the option to select a new
phone number or port an existing one and

181
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:41,190
tangled,
break your rates up by minutes,

182
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:46,191
text messages and megabytes and bill you
at the end of the month for what you've

183
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:51,180
used. Why am I pausing? I'm 98% of people
saved money with Tang. They love it.

184
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,890
So you'll love it too. Uh, we're also
brought to you by on it, o. N n. I.

185
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:57,830
T if you haven't been to on it for awhile.

186
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,530
We have a lot of new shit
including digestive tech enzymes,

187
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,720
trying to get involved in as many
things that optimize health as possible.

188
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,010
And I'm sure along the way there's going
to be some that I find not worth the

189
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,670
effort and there's going
to be some that I find, uh,

190
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,350
they don't really seem to help. But, uh,

191
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,130
I am a believer in digestive
enzymes. Um, I think that

192
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,860
you get enzymes from food, you know,
and you can get enzymes from, I mean,

193
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,840
from milk,
like raw milk.

194
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:31,170
It's one of the reasons why raw milk
digests better than pasteurized and

195
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:33,840
homogenized milk because
it has the enzymes in it.

196
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,680
It's like it's a normal thing to eat
when you're eating milk and it's gone

197
00:11:37,681 --> 00:11:41,580
through pasteurization and what does
it homogenization. Is that what it is?

198
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,690
Cause that was your
homogenization, whatever the
word is, whatever the word is,

199
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:48,270
where they boil the fuck out of it
and kill everything that's alive.

200
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,570
You're not supposed to eat it like that.
Like when it goes into your system,

201
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,070
your system's like,
what is this fucking

202
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,241
dead shit?

203
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:58,900
You just threw down the hole and then
you start lifting your cheeks up and cut

204
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:01,360
and horrible milk farts. Yeah. Dude,

205
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,610
I was by myself last night
and I had cookies in milk.

206
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,810
I just laid some of the worst farts
of my career. Yeah, that's nice.

207
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,380
I didn't yet get any digestive enzymes.
I fucked up Tommy Buns.

208
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,890
Cookies and milk did it? Yeah.
Cookies and milk are not good.

209
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,350
Gluten free or whatever.
Still Milk.

210
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,410
I had Carnegie aside and eggs for
breakfast with a Spanish rice and uh,

211
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,800
all kinds of dead stuff out of me.

212
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,920
It was hard to a dead stuff. He's
seen the Godzilla trailer. Uh,

213
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,980
no. You haven't seen it. Oh wait,
no. Maybe I did. I was a new way.

214
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,600
There's a new one that's just a new one.
Oh, it makes me, I saw the other one paid.

215
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,170
Merrick's Ma Monster Boehner. Hard. Pretty
good. Yeah. It looks pretty bad ass.

216
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,560
There's all kinds of new monsters in
here. Yeah. Speaking of monsters. Yeah,

217
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,590
we have, we have Zombie kettle bells
too. It's the newest thing we have.

218
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,620
If you're like a big walking dead fan
and you're like, you know what, man,

219
00:12:53,621 --> 00:12:57,160
I need to prepare for the invasion.
I need to feel it in my bones.

220
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,640
I'm trying to work it out with one
hour of Zombie. Kettlebells awaits.

221
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,890
What weights do you have?
72 pounds. 54 pounds,

222
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,810
36 pounds and 18 pounds. If you've never
done it before, start with 18 trust me.

223
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,050
You can get a really good workout with
18 and you're like, that's ridiculous.

224
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:15,190
I'm a fucking savage man. I know you
are. I know you aren't, dude. Trust me.

225
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,480
Get the Keith Weber Extreme
Kettlebell cardio DVD that they sell.

226
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:24,481
There's one and two that they sell it
on at.com and that cardio workout will

227
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:28,660
fuck you up. I'm in pretty good shape and
that thing fucks me up with 35 pounds.

228
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,130
What is it credible?
What's the workout?

229
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,650
It's called the extreme
kettle bell cardio workout.

230
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,130
It's not like a bulk thing and you're
not lifting like a lot of weight.

231
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,450
Like I do the, I seriously
do this exercise with 35
pounds, which is pretty light.

232
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:43,270
You know, I can pick
that up pretty easy. Um,

233
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,300
but when you do it and you know,

234
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:50,020
you get five minutes in and your lungs
were on fire and your fucking legs are

235
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:51,760
burning,
you don't,

236
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:54,760
you can't believe what kind of a workout
you can get with just an 18 pound

237
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:58,800
kettle bell. How long do you do that
workout for? 40 minutes. Whoa. It's hard.

238
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,170
It's intense. It's brutal. Yeah. My
Heart's killing me at the end of it.

239
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,440
Everything is killing me. My
heart's pounding. I can't breathe.

240
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,150
It's amazing that that's like that.

241
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:09,640
You could do that with a 35 pound
kettle bell. When I was young,

242
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,060
when I just used to do like weightlifting
stuff like bench press and shit like

243
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,750
that.
I used to think that 35 pounds for policy.

244
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:20,740
So I wanted to get past that 35 pounds
as quick as possible using the fifties

245
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:24,920
now like that's what everybody does.
They want to go to 15 hundreds. Yeah. Um,

246
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,130
I think somewhere along the line
you realize how much strength,

247
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,490
I mean especially when it
comes to athletic performance,

248
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,550
how much strength you need and how
much muscular endurance you need.

249
00:14:33,551 --> 00:14:38,551
Muscular endurance is a huge part of
anything athletic and using dude doing 35

250
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,630
pounds. Yeah, you're
going to develop strength,

251
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:44,860
but you're really going to
develop muscular endurance
and you could build muscle

252
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:48,730
on bodyweight exercises with a 35 pound
kettle bell and you could have a fucking

253
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,430
rocking sexy body. Tommy ponds
were, I'm trying to do it.

254
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:58,970
I took my first, uh, kickboxing Muay Thai
guys yesterday. Oh, it's so good for you,

255
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,430
man. Yeah, that's great.
Especially if you go to what Jim?

256
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:06,140
Um, it's, uh, it's down in
so I could stalk you. Yeah,

257
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,160
I'll tell you later

258
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,010
on a.com. Oh, and,

259
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:13,230
and it used to code name rogue and
save 10% off any and all supplements.

260
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,960
He bonds.
Is He

261
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,650
bomp bomp bomp bomp oh yeah. Um, this,
uh, Wednesday night where the Ice House,

262
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,170
uh, it's me, Ian Edwards.

263
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,270
I'm Tony Hinchcliffe. A full charge. Yeah,

264
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:34,410
the full charge map, full Tron, uh,
Lee camp. And I think that's it.

265
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,180
That place is the best. Yeah. It's
amazing. It's going to be fun. Uh, it's,

266
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:40,630
it's one of the coolest places to
perform in southern California.

267
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:44,450
I would've gone, I got to have dinner
with my cousin Brian. If you hate,

268
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:46,170
if you get out of there
and they'd go to bed early,

269
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,670
they're going to be at your house

270
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,720
now. I'm going to be kind
of east side of town. Maybe

271
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,850
fucking cart blanche Tom Bunch anytime
you want. I appreciate that. And um,

272
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,810
December 27th at the Mirage in Vegas,
it's me,

273
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,630
Joey Diaz,
Ari Shaffir,

274
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,810
and Brian Cowen trying to put the ground,

275
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,420
the greatest show in the history of the
universe. So Joey Diaz, Ari Shaffir,

276
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,430
Brian Cowen and me, uh,
all at the Mirage in Vegas.

277
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,730
Can't fucking wait for that. We're
going to have so much fun. Yeah.

278
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,100
That's going to be,
those people going to walk out of there.

279
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:22,430
They're going to be bleeding
from laughing. That's crazy.

280
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,880
I spent the weekend with Joey.
Oh,

281
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,150
he's the greatest human being that's
ever walked the face of the planet.

282
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,770
Oh my gosh. Cue The music. We'll
talk about your weekend experience.

283
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,060
Try my day. Joe Rogan podcast. Tom,

284
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,170
what'd you guys go? You went with
Joey somewhere? Yeah, and Joey and I,

285
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,050
uh, the Calusa casino in northern
California and then went to hell.

286
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,610
The point is that that's like,

287
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,620
it's an hour from the Sacramento and then
we did a Mcdonald theater and Eugene,

288
00:16:56,551 --> 00:17:01,170
Oregon on Saturday. Wow. Eugene,
Oregon. Must've been fun.

289
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,090
Yeah,
they had snow like that.

290
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:08,730
A snow storm the night before
and all. We were like, yeah,

291
00:17:08,731 --> 00:17:11,810
it's fucking Oregon. Like they get snow.
Big Deal. We got there and the like,

292
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,220
we haven't had snow in four
years. We were like, oh wow.

293
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,830
Because they didn't plow any roads.
None.

294
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:21,990
So everything was just caked over iced
over. That part of the real blinding.

295
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,520
I thought it happened all the time there.

296
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,910
Do you remember when they did that in
New York City when it snowed and they

297
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:31,110
didn't blame him? Plow? No, there was a
big deal. It was a couple of years ago.

298
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,340
It was a couple of years ago.

299
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:35,730
There was a huge thing where they didn't
budget correctly and they had a big

300
00:17:35,731 --> 00:17:38,670
snow storm and people were trying to get
out there like where the fuck are the

301
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:42,750
plows? Yeah, it's funny, there's
certain you can tell who's set up,

302
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:46,250
who's used to snow because of,
because solely because of the road.

303
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:50,190
It's like when you're in Minneapolis
and they'd be like, you know,

304
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,050
eight inches fell last
night. You're like, Ooh,

305
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,220
I wonder how that'll let you step
outside and you just see, you see black.

306
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,230
Like they paved it immediately.
You don't see any way there.

307
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,470
They're just on top of that shit. And then
you go like clearly when we were like,

308
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,000
oh, you guys never get
snow here because the road,

309
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,920
and then I saw today people
who are at the shows,

310
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:13,500
I went to their Twitter and their like,
roads are still shit.

311
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:17,310
Like I haven't done anything
for like three days. It was a,

312
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:22,560
a video of famous video from Oregon of
these people sliding on this icy road.

313
00:18:22,991 --> 00:18:23,621
Really?
Yeah.

314
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:28,030
It's a famous video because
I guess they're just
notoriously shitty and allowing

315
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:30,400
because it doesn't snow very,
they didn't do a fucking thing.

316
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,510
This video is ridiculous.

317
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:34,330
It's like 10 minutes long of people
just crashing into each other.

318
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,470
Just standing there watching people
come down this road and smash into each

319
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:38,880
other.

320
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,530
Dude,
the funny thing is they,

321
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,220
the promoter called us a few hours
before the show and she's like, man,

322
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:47,850
we've been getting a lot of phone
calls of people. Like I can't, I'm not,

323
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,240
I can't drive in this. We're not
gonna make it. She was like a lot,

324
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,270
I don't know how many people are
going to be at your show. I was like,

325
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:57,180
well how many, you know, there's
nothing we can do about that. Like okay.

326
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,980
Right and then we get there and
there's still like a great turnout.

327
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,130
Everybody who came was a podcast list.

328
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,350
This, Whoa, look how they're
sliding all over the place.

329
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,430
I mean that it's fucking ice. Yeah,
I can't stop his car. Look, look.

330
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:17,280
It's just going to slide in that
car behind him. This is ridiculous.

331
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,830
Is that important? Oh Shit.
Boom. Nascar's sliding.

332
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,660
They're all sliding.
The whole thing is ice.

333
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,100
That is fucking terrifying. Cause
what to the right? That's water.

334
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,780
Oh No. Yeah Dude. That shit
is absolutely terrified.

335
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:36,810
Sky Bridges are our real problem.
Bridges for some reason,

336
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,740
because they're not connected to the
earth. That ground freezes super quick.

337
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,780
So if you're in a place and it gets,

338
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:46,350
it starts getting cold when you
might be in an icy rain situation.

339
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:51,510
Stay the fuck off of bridges,
guys. Like you fucking, oh my God.

340
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:55,980
Look at this thing, man. This is crazy.
Look at this thing. Just sliding.

341
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,860
What part of Oregon is this?
It doesn't say I'm Maria.

342
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,910
Portland. Portland. Yeah, you bitches
got to prepare for it. Okay. That's,

343
00:20:05,911 --> 00:20:10,560
this is preposterous. Portland,
Oregon frozen rain is what it is.

344
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,750
You could see on those, uh, like on
that fence when you could see that,

345
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:17,580
that shit that's sitting there
that looks like snow and snow,

346
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:21,480
but it's also a lot of frozen rain.
It's like when it gets to be like 32,

347
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,510
just 32 and it was just 33 and (333)
023-0430 two and you get that horrible

348
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:33,870
fucking frozen rain.
UHMM son Shit.

349
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,160
Yeah. Fuck that noise.
He's still going sideways.

350
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,020
When I was a kid, when I was in high
school, me and my friend John Jewitt,

351
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,100
he was a, my sister's boyfriend.
We were on the roof of the garage.

352
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,990
Me and him just sitting
there drinking beer,

353
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,260
watching cars slide into each other
on our street the best because people

354
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:56,320
couldn't,
I lived on a hill and a no one,

355
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,380
you couldn't tell that it was a
total black eyes. You couldn't tell.

356
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,350
So people were driving like
normal. Yeah. Then it would

357
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,100
just whew

358
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,720
across from a river and like when it would
start to freeze, like I would get it,

359
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,170
you know, and you're close to the water,
you know, I guess maybe it's colder.

360
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,480
I mean, if that makes any sense. But uh,

361
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,620
the fucking entire street
just was a giant hockey rink.

362
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,970
So we called the cops and the cops came
down the hill and the cops came down the

363
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:24,580
hill just bang poem.
But they came to investigate.

364
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,330
These guys don't know how to
drive. That's the problem. Yeah.

365
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,180
The whole thing was a hockey rink.

366
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,410
So they got in and just bounced off
the curves this in mass. Whew. Yeah.

367
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:36,770
Newton Newton. Upper falls. Jesus Christ.

368
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,190
Yeah, it was, it was whore, dude. I
gotta tell you Diaz, first of all,

369
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,910
he got stopped in three different airports
by like eight different people this

370
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,370
weekend. Oh. By throngs of
fans. You're saying fans, TSA

371
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,310
at the airport and they want to
check out her, his balls for weed.

372
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,140
He, first of all, my God,

373
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,760
that is his tolerance is
it's under running. Dude,

374
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,960
I took a quarter of a bite of an
edible. You're brave quarter. Yeah,

375
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,930
I mean the very end of it and 30
minutes later I was just out of my mind.

376
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:20,320
I mean,

377
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,260
my eyes weren't even open and I could
tell people were looking at me like they

378
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:28,720
were like, yeah, I mean
you're, you're like, oh, I'm
not hiding this. This is bad.

379
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,890
And he ate of that.
He ate an entire one like that.

380
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,260
And then he's like saying
ridiculous Shit Shit that I,

381
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:39,730
I feel like I get arrested
for thinking it. Like I don't,

382
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,390
I can't play it back in my head.
I was like, dude, shut the fuck.

383
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,210
Is he saying I cannot, I really can't say
the main thing that he was, I can't, hey,

384
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,181
it would be,
it would be,

385
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:53,890
it was not okay to say [inaudible]
have to do with ethnic groups,

386
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,550
racial things.

387
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,630
This one in particular is so awful.

388
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,070
Like I came to spin it. I can't
spend a joke, you know, I have,

389
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,590
and this is one of the things
that I've been on about lately.

390
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,120
I have a real problem when people get
upset at people that say shit that they

391
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:20,680
don't really mean, but that's awful,
but hilarious. Yeah, I agree. I agree.

392
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:25,170
Because like look how hard we're laughing.
No, yeah, I get the picture. You guys.

393
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:29,860
Yeah. I don't even know what he said.
I don't even know what he said to you.

394
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,940
And I'm already laughing.

395
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,150
Just crazy thinking about all the shit
he said to me in the path. Of course.

396
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:37,660
Of course. Well, he, he's going off
about this thing. I'm standing there,

397
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:41,560
I look like I'm gonna puke because I'm
laughing so hard because this is in the

398
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:45,750
airport and he's around people.
He has no give a fuck,

399
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,690
fuck blah, blah, blah. Shut
up dude. He doesn't give a
fuck. And I've, I have tears.

400
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,940
People looking at my, and then he's
like Tsa and uh, this guy, I look in,

401
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:59,420
the uniform looks over and he's like, you
got to look at this guy. I'm like, dude,

402
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:03,140
I'm all fucked up. Like
don't bring attention to me
right now. And then that guy,

403
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,660
he's like, Hey Joe Diaz,
I'm a big fan. I'm like,

404
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:08,750
are you fucking kidding me right now? I
turn around and walk away. I was like,

405
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:13,280
I'm leaving. It's too high for this.
I walked away, I leave him, I'm like,

406
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:15,680
I don't want any part of the shit.
And I go,

407
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,340
I buy a magazine that I leave at the
counter. That's how high. I'm like,

408
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,203
I want to get this magazine.

409
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,880
And then I walk away from it and I
remember like 30 minutes later before we

410
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,560
board and I go back and it's sitting
there and I go, that's my magazine ladies.

411
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,150
Like, okay. And I go, I paid for
it already. And she was like,

412
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,890
okay, like go ahead and take that
if you went so out of my mind.

413
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,660
But then, then we walked by, we go
and a guy, a fucking pilot comes by,

414
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:42,660
you know when they have like,

415
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,100
they're always have the double
look luggage thing right there.

416
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:49,040
One bag on top of the other,
the pilot bag.

417
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,970
He fucking walks by us and he's
like, Hey Joey Diaz. And I'm like,

418
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,850
are you serious right now? And
he's like, it's my airport.

419
00:24:55,851 --> 00:24:59,990
Everybody calls me to say what I'm like,
really? My airport and then Oregon,

420
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,830
this was in Burbank,
Burbank airport.

421
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,030
We then get stopped in,

422
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,480
we land in Sacramento and
people stop them for pictures.

423
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,800
Then the baggage handler, uh, stops him.

424
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,530
Asked him like 100 weeks.
I hate these fucking questions guys.

425
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:22,520
Ask Way too many questions. No.
Okay. So we, we leave there.

426
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:25,670
Well he's super high. Can't off just
having conversations with people.

427
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,630
Then a family stops him.
A lady with kids stops him for a picture.

428
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,620
They all take a picture together. Like
it was nonstop. The best was that, oh,

429
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:34,490
this is the best part.

430
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,650
So I take the quarter bite right and
I'm completely fucking out of my mind.

431
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,450
He eats an entire one.

432
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,280
We sit down on the plane and he
starts talking to me. I'm like,

433
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:48,050
shut up man.
Shut the fuck up.

434
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,480
I cannot listen to you right now
cause I'm like shaking. I'm like,

435
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,920
I told him to shut up. Cause you're
laughing. Yes, yes. I'm like,

436
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:58,820
I can't hear you talk. Shut
up. And he's like, he's like,

437
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,020
he like looks around. He's like,
anyways. And he opens up a second one,

438
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,590
eats the sec and of the thing
I have a quarter bite of,

439
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,680
so he's on eight doses of I'm

440
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,180
and I'm like,
Jesus Christ.

441
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:19,430
So we go through this flight and every
time he looks at me, like I said, he goes,

442
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,990
oh. And I'm like, dude,
shut the dog and story.

443
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,010
No dunking a cookie. And then he calls
him an hour and a half later. It goes,

444
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,690
welcome to my world mother Fucker,

445
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,790
Dude. Ow, ow, ow. We land,

446
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,350
we land and I, and um, as
we're landing, I was like, man,

447
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,850
I go, dude, I was, I was pretty
fucked up man. And he goes,

448
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,860
and I look at him because
all I'm thinking is like,

449
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:54,840
I can't believe how much more advanced
you are. The me, you know, it's like,

450
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,380
like, I cannot believe what you mean
tolerance wise. It's like, it's like,

451
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:01,710
I can't believe I ran a mile
and you just ran 40 miles,

452
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:05,640
like as crazy as me and we both
finished at the same time and then I go.

453
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:08,460
So I'm amazed that he's not affected.
I go,

454
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,260
I can't believe how much that fucking me.
He goes,

455
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,140
I almost had three panic
attacks on that flight.

456
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,280
I was like, yes. It made me
so happy that he was awesome,

457
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,100
so fucked up. And He, I was like, Carrie
still goes right back, right back in.

458
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,660
I go, I go, I'm glad it's starting to
wear off. He goes, not for me. I'm fucking

459
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,573
upright.

460
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,630
Yeah. His idea of going deep is
so much deeper than your idea.

461
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,050
He's breaking world records
on a daily basis all the time.

462
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:41,240
He's at the bottom of the Marianas
trench with a shovel and he's like,

463
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:43,360
there's got to be a deepest spot.
This is bullshit.

464
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,560
And the first thing he did as we get off
that was like, let's smoke this joint.

465
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,010
I was like, are you talking about,
what are you talking about man?

466
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,220
We're not smoking a joint.
I can take a break.

467
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,320
And he's a maniac.

468
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:00,760
He's a brainiac. Yeah. Well he just
goes through the whole day like that.

469
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,390
And that's where, you know, people
would step in and say, well,

470
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,210
that boy's got a problem. Yeah. I'll
tell you what he got. But he doesn't,

471
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,850
he gets for a comedian. Yeah. It might
be the best way to live life. Yeah.

472
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:16,270
Scared on a regular basis and in
betweens. Laughing your dick off. Scared,

473
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,680
laughing your dick off. Scared, laughing
you dick off. Yeah. He, um, uh, he's,

474
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,460
the funny thing is like,
even his

475
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,770
regular cadence,

476
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,370
it's so is out of the norm for other
people that you see people react to them.

477
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,800
It's more fun to even watch people like
at the restaurant next to us react to

478
00:28:36,951 --> 00:28:41,330
him than it is almost to watch him.
Like he's talking and I see them like,

479
00:28:41,331 --> 00:28:43,430
they're like, Jesus. Like
this is like a fucking,

480
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,460
it's like you brought in a pit bull to
have lunch here. You know what I mean?

481
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:51,200
They've never seen somebody so intense
and animate and saying these crazy things.

482
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,380
It's like you watch them react to Joey.

483
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,900
Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. I
know what you mean, man. He's just,

484
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,380
it's just a, they don't come
along that often. No, he's a,

485
00:29:02,381 --> 00:29:06,010
it's a rare thing that's a
there. They're like, well,
who's this guy? Yeah. You know,

486
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,750
like you know guys and you go,
oh I get it.

487
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:09,280
That guy's like a little bit of this guy.

488
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,200
A little bit of that guy's combination of

489
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,640
Joey's just like, what is
that? Where'd that come from?

490
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,420
You want to kill somebody? You
invite him over for dinner. What?

491
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:24,910
Oh is his logic,
how to get crimes committed correctly.

492
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,000
And then my favorite thing is
they'll say something and go,

493
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:30,190
you know what the fuck I'm saying
is I need to just walks away.

494
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,260
I can end on a strong point.
You want to kill somebody,

495
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:36,880
you invite him over for dinner. Boom. He
walks away. Great sense of timing. Yeah.

496
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,060
Amazing. It's, it's a standup timing that
he uses like in everyday real life. Yeah.

497
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,530
It's like never doing an act.
Yeah. Cause his act, his,

498
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:50,080
his life and his life is his act. Yeah.
The way he talks his, his act. Totally.

499
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,030
That's like the best
you could ever hope for.

500
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:57,070
The best you could ever hope for is like
a merging of you and your ability to be

501
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:59,390
you offstage and onstage. Yeah. I mean,

502
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,310
I mean look at like who everybody or
a lot of people that say it was like,

503
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,144
you know,

504
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:09,150
total master comedian basically talks
in his voice like Chapelle walks up and

505
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,420
he's like tells you about his day. Yeah.
And that's kind of like the highest form,

506
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:15,440
right, of being a comment. Cause
you're like, I'm just going to,

507
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,550
this isn't even a thing. I'm
just talking to you. Yeah.

508
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,170
And like Diaz is like a version of that
where like he's just being Diaz. Yeah,

509
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:26,350
just being Diaz. But he also works
out, it works really hard. He writes,

510
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,050
he does a lot of sets.
Joey does a lot of sets.

511
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,360
He'll go up like four or five times a
week in town in weird places. So yeah.

512
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,250
Travel to Oxnard and shit
and do a set somewhere.

513
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:39,790
He does a lot of like weird
sets. He does. He gets up a lot.

514
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,560
He was killing it man. Killing him.
I'm sure he was. Man. What is a Eugene,

515
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:47,670
Oregon like besides hippie and
they don't know how to plow. We,

516
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,060
we got to see so little of it
because of the weather. Like it was,

517
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,890
it was for Real Hotel Gig hotel.
There was no checking anything out.

518
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:00,760
Right. But the people were awesome. I
mean, I couldn't believe how fun that was.

519
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:04,660
The most fun. That was the funniest show.
I've had like top three show the year.

520
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,990
Why Fun.
And it was because of that,

521
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,890
whether the only people that
showed up were podcast listeners.

522
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,430
So they listened to Joey's podcasts to
listen to mine and they were just all

523
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,840
fans. So it was like, it was such
a, it was like doing a, you know,

524
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,640
I was like a special event kind of show.
These audiences are so different now.

525
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,770
Oh my God. They're like great hunt
free. I was like, can you get like the,

526
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:31,090
like the amount of constant you
get? There's nothing but love. Yeah.

527
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:34,330
Just nice people. Yeah.
It was awesome. Oh,

528
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,110
so it's weird isn't it? Oh
yeah, it's, it's, and it's,

529
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,110
you can see it's changed so much.

530
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:44,920
Like for me it's changed so much
in the last few years. Yeah.

531
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,420
It's just for everybody. Yeah.
Everybody, all of us. Yeah.

532
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:50,320
It's changed.

533
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:55,321
And then the other thing that like we do
now is we do our podcast live and it's

534
00:31:55,451 --> 00:32:00,190
like, it's, it's like a different type
of live performance. Right. You know,

535
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,260
it's so fun to go. Yeah. You have
a totally different thing going on.

536
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:06,740
You guys have like a live show. Yeah.
It's like a show, you know, it's like, uh,

537
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,590
like uh,
an actual performance.

538
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,310
But your podcast fits that well
because your podcast has a lot of like

539
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:17,140
reoccurring Skitch sketches or skits.
Calm segments almost.

540
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:18,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Betsy,

541
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,680
do you have a bunch of reoccurring things
that you do people look forward to?

542
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,690
They look forward to? So what we try
to do on those live ones is like,

543
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,340
if we know they look forward to it,

544
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,500
we'll try to at least do a couple of
them and it gets the crowds so excited

545
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:33,910
about it. So it's like
a fun thing. It's like,

546
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,020
it's almost like the equivalent of being
a band and you have a couple of hits,

547
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,100
you know what I mean? Right
there where they, you know,

548
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,120
they liked that song.

549
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,390
So I'm going to play the song at some
point because I know that's why you showed

550
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:47,390
up, right? Yeah. So yeah,
it's, it's pretty fun, man.

551
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,670
It's changed everything though for for
our standup too. Yeah. It's weird, right?

552
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,740
It's,
it's so crazy.

553
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,830
It's weird that it all happened out of
the Internet to everybody thought they

554
00:32:57,831 --> 00:32:58,940
had to get on TV.

555
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:02,150
Everybody thought that the way to
get a fan base has to be on TV,

556
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,950
but that's actually the
way to get a fan base.

557
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,660
It doesn't really know you exactly.

558
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,810
Like if you're on a sitcom like
Mike and Molly, Billy Gardell,

559
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:12,440
very funny guy and he's going to go see
him. Great Guy. Very good guy. Great Guy.

560
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:16,280
Funny Guy. You know, good for him.
He's got a sitcom, it's great.

561
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,710
But if you want to go see him, you, you,

562
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:23,380
you're going to see the funny guy that
you see on that show playing a character.

563
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,100
It's not him doing stand up. If you go to
see him doing, stand up, you, you know,

564
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,270
like you know him in a form
of what he does. Right.

565
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,870
But you don't know him right? When they
go to cu, they fucking know you, right?

566
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,733
I mean,
you and I look,

567
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,520
the way we talk right now is the way we
talk when we shut this thing off. Right?

568
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,930
If we shut it off, it would be
real similar. We'd be talking shit.

569
00:33:44,931 --> 00:33:48,500
You tell me what Joey actually said.
That's it be the only difference.

570
00:33:48,501 --> 00:33:52,160
That'd be the only difference in
this conversation. And I think, um,

571
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,430
it's the best way to get a
good crowd or an asshole crowd.

572
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:59,000
If you're an asshole and you promote
assholishness behavior, I fucking seen it,

573
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:01,400
man. Have you seen it?
Absolutely. With who?

574
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,810
I can't tell you who does the name
rhymed with. No, but somebody,

575
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,000
it's somebody I don't think you know.
Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't know that dude.

576
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,860
You don't know this guy I've seen, I've
seen crazy. They're real tall. Yeah.

577
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:19,970
Uh, I've seen, I've seen people
cultivate those and I've also,

578
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,700
the other thing I've seen is
people who have that problem.

579
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:23,291
You're talking about guys,

580
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:26,600
and I say it as a problem is
that they might be a certain way.

581
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,460
Then they do this show that's not like
them and you draw a crowd who was like,

582
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,610
I thought you were going to
be this type of humor. Right.

583
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,300
That's the great thing about doing
your like your like it works out great.

584
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:39,480
I'll tell you it works out great for us.

585
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:44,481
The guy like tosh where he does his
style of jokes on tosh 0.0 if you're not

586
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:49,730
responding to what he's doing on
that show, if you don't like that,

587
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,910
you're not going to like a stand up.

588
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:53,390
But if you like what that
show and you like those jokes,

589
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,550
you're going to love
seeing Daniel Tosh live.

590
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,610
You know it's the smartest way to promote
his live standup is doing that show.

591
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:06,980
Yes, his wheel house. It's great.
It's fucking funny to, it's great.

592
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:09,890
It's so funny. He has some good
writers on that show. He does. Yeah.

593
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,550
He's a funny guy. He's a really
funny guy. He's a good guy too, man.

594
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,140
It's a really good guy. It's
nice. It's nice one good
guys. Make it definitely. Oh,

595
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,440
Joey Diaz was talking about Kevin Hart
about what a Great Guy Kevin Hart is

596
00:35:21,441 --> 00:35:23,240
because Joey's in that
new movie with them. Oh,

597
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:26,260
Robert De Niro and semesters alone,
whatever it is. They're like, yeah, ed.

598
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:30,380
And they're going to box people. Do people
understand bleeding? Do you understand?

599
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:34,320
Like how hard it is to stop blood from,
you know,

600
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,620
pouring out of your fucking brain when
you're 80 and you're getting punched in

601
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,190
the head.

602
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,050
Like the idea that movie is more
preposterous than Godzilla. That the idea,

603
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:48,030
that movie that you're going to live,
is it like former champs for him? Yeah,

604
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:50,310
a former boxers and they hate each other.

605
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:55,380
[inaudible] good to go do it one more
time and they're like 80 this is like,

606
00:35:55,381 --> 00:35:58,350
it's so irresponsible to,
yeah, because you know what,

607
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,570
when you're 80 and you take head injuries,
you don't fucking recover from ever.

608
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:08,760
I mean the suspension of disbelief
involved in watching two old guys beat the

609
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:13,260
fuck out of each other on TV. This, nobody
would pay for that. It would be sad.

610
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,400
Like if you saw Larry Holmes today
and Larry Holmes fought, you know,

611
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,530
bone crusher Smith today.

612
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I mean it would really be sad to watch
and Larry is at least 15 maybe even 20

613
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:27,780
years younger than Stallone.
How,

614
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,540
how hurt would these guys be you think
during the fight? What did they just,

615
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,000
they die. They both
die. Sylvester Stallone,

616
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,590
Jews to the Gills pay 72 years
old. It's grapes. Fantastic.

617
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,250
He would murder,
I'm sure Merde de Niro.

618
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:46,230
Unless the hero God on the sauce as well.

619
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,560
Deniro would have to be on the sauce for
at least a year. Maybe he has, I mean,

620
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:51,870
so many men are on
testosterone replacement now.

621
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:53,820
They have commercials for
it on television. Totally.

622
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,880
But I have feeling that the levels that
Sylvester Stallone takes are very high.

623
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,870
Yeah. He's got really
low body fat too. I mean,

624
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,820
we've seen a picture of him walking down
Beverly Hills and you see the veins in

625
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:08,130
his forearms. No, dude,

626
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,310
it's still from this movie
that looks crazy as shit.

627
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,780
We're selling gay for some of us just
doing fine. Yeah, I'm fine with that.

628
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,730
Give me your flavor.
I met the guy,

629
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,380
I had to interview them for a
spike TV and he couldn't be nicer.

630
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,670
Yeah. Normal like didn't give
a fuck. He's, he's been there,

631
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:28,260
done that for so fucking long.

632
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,350
That's the reason why he has like a sense
of humor about himself now that maybe

633
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:35,160
he didn't when he was younger.
Like he's very relaxed man. Yeah.

634
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,900
He's very like talking to him could
not have been like easier and smoother.

635
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,410
Like when you're talking to like
someone and you interview someone,

636
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:49,130
a lot of the conversation depends on
whether or not that person is relaxed,

637
00:37:50,251 --> 00:37:52,950
whether or not they're comfortable
and if they're not comfortable, man,

638
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:56,370
the conversations kind of sucked.
It gets hard to do with him.

639
00:37:56,371 --> 00:38:00,700
He's just at ease, laughing
and joking and you know, made,

640
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:04,770
made some joke about his
mother, his intelligence and
just, he was just funny man.

641
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,440
Yeah. Relaxed. Yeah. That's cool.

642
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,760
But you're not supposed to look like
that when you're seven Nissan. No,

643
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:12,594
that's ridiculous.

644
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,700
I was like the most notoriously
difficult interview. Well,

645
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:20,700
he doesn't want to do it right
and he shouldn't. You know,

646
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,190
I think a guy like that as dessert,

647
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,880
he's earned the right to talk to whoever
he wants to talk to and that's it.

648
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,630
And if he doesn't want to be interviewed
about things, I don't need to know him.

649
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,960
He can tell me about him,
what he wants to tell me about him.

650
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:35,470
I don't need to know him.
And I think

651
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,810
the, the, the beauty of being
an actor, there's probably some,

652
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,250
there's probably some merit and some
extra power in me not knowing him and

653
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:49,810
knowing that he can go from being the
guy in taxi driver to, you know, being,

654
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,630
you know, fill in the blank. Being
the guy from the godfather to me,

655
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,760
he can morph, he can change who he
is. Being the guy from Cape Fear,

656
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,650
he can morph. And I think if you know
too much of what he is really like,

657
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:07,260
could you imagine on the flight safe
Deniro had a podcast and on the podcast

658
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:11,220
every day, who's got his glasses over his
nose either, Ooh, see what we got here.

659
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,800
And he's, she's reading things. And
he's giving you his opinions on things.

660
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:19,060
I like flowers when actors start doing
that. It puts them in a weird category.

661
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,260
It's true.
It's true.

662
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,300
And it almost like the ideal way to
be an actor would be to do no press.

663
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,880
Yeah. They do press because
they have to, you know,

664
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:32,050
a lot of times they're
contractually obligated to do
press to promote movies and

665
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:34,860
it's all about promoting,
but it does, you know,

666
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,540
the more you know that person,

667
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,520
the harder it is to see them
playing characters. Yeah, sure.

668
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:46,290
Absolutely. Yeah. Things get weird. Like,

669
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,310
like that was one of the things that
was, that people relished about that. Um,

670
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,340
the audio that was leaked of Christian
Bale screaming at some guy on the set.

671
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,730
Yeah. And a lot of people are like, wow,
he's a fucking asshole. He's an asshole.

672
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,290
And Yeah, he's definitely obviously
very aggressive. But what people,

673
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,130
what people liked about that is they
got to see a human like with no script,

674
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,070
no. Okay, I'm going to go
sit on the couch with Oprah.

675
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:18,430
No chatting here with David Letterman,
with my legs crossed.

676
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,340
Like I would never do in real life
because none of that. He's like,

677
00:40:21,341 --> 00:40:24,420
for fuck's sake, man.
You're a fucking amateur.

678
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,470
Just screaming at some lighting guy.
Yeah.

679
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,980
There's a Sylvester Stallone
at like 70 Oh my God.

680
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,950
It's not a joke either.
He's like 70. How old is he?

681
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,250
67 that's like 70.
That's amazing. Yeah. Um,

682
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,530
my grandpa didn't look like that
when he was 67 matter of fact,

683
00:40:44,531 --> 00:40:46,840
I think that's around
when he died of old age.

684
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,760
I think my grandpa died of old age,

685
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:53,410
around 60 sounds 70 but he
didn't look like that. No at all.

686
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,300
No. My grandpa stopped
looking like that. Like 63 six

687
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,580
there's just something
weird about that man.

688
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:05,470
The idea that you can have a movie where
these two dudes who were in their late

689
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,700
sixties punch each other in the
head and their brains just are fine.

690
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,890
So that was when he was young. It's sexy.
That was the old days. Look, you know,

691
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,850
I could tell that beautiful face.
Very unusual face check.

692
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,840
I'd let them send it in. Yeah, just
for that unusual. Just for that face.

693
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:27,310
Just that seventies. Look the fucking
jacket on that beautiful hair.

694
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,150
It's feathers. Feathers, not even
hair follicles. Yeah. He's um,

695
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,640
he's the canary in the coal mine
for all who don't want to get old.

696
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,070
That's what you can look like. You might
be a workout animal at 67 too. Huh?

697
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,740
I don't know. I don't know if
I can keep it up. I don't know.

698
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,250
You gotta face the inevitability of
your own demise at some point in time.

699
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,670
I would assume that you can keep
up a certain amount, but um,

700
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:53,330
our buddy Jimmy just had a fucking
hip replacement. Mark Coleman,

701
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,620
former UFC heavyweight champion.

702
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:58,790
The first actually UFC heavyweight
champion just had a hip replacement.

703
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,560
The Hammer, the hammer hammer.
Great Guy. Hiphop told me. Yeah,

704
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:06,410
he told me he was in fucking pain for a
long time and just couldn't do anything

705
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,940
about it.
It's like the,

706
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:13,010
the amount of work that you have to do
to be like a high level amateur wrestler.

707
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,900
Yeah. Amount of fucking beating that
puts on your body. The amount of stress,

708
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,830
the, the, just the intensity
of those workouts in the, they,

709
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:25,280
they're all tough as shit. So they all
power through injuries all the time.

710
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,300
And a lot of guys get, you know, really
longterm stuff. Like I know Coleman,

711
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,840
he sat neck surgery as well.
Tito has had a two,

712
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,710
at least two discs fused.
She's, you know, um,

713
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:41,300
an innate Neda quarry had, uh,
at least two fused as well.

714
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:43,670
He had it like artificial disc,
putting his lower back.

715
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,120
They create artificial discs
now screw them into the, it's,

716
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,740
it's a fucking tough businessman now.
There's no question that like,

717
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,800
guys like that and professional athletes
are obviously like really doing,

718
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,620
you know, longterm damage where they
have a lot of these replacement. Yeah.

719
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:06,820
But don't you find that even the amateur
athlete that does certain sports for a

720
00:43:09,111 --> 00:43:10,100
long period of time,

721
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,390
inevitably a percentage of them all
need the same thing too. I mean,

722
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:17,690
I have an uncle who was,
you know, not a pro athlete,

723
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,100
but a guy who played either
racketball, handball, tennis,

724
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,600
like six days a week. Like one of those
just guys who was really into it, devoted,

725
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,250
you know, that was his whole pro that
he's had two knees and a hip replaced.

726
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,450
And I know,

727
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,400
I know other guys who are
not cause he's like 72 now,

728
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,160
but I know other guys in their sixties,

729
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,330
like he's just like friends of
parents and stuff. They're like,

730
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,440
oh you just had a knee surgery. And
these are just guys who, you know,

731
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,980
played sports. Like they were active,
people didn't do anything. Like, you know,

732
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,180
violent, didn't do a
combat, uh, contact sports.

733
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,740
But they all have things, surgeries,
you know, back, knee, hip.

734
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:59,180
I feel like it's almost inevitable.

735
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:02,360
It's almost inevitable if you
keep beating your body up.

736
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,330
If you don't do the proper rehab,
if you don't stretch,

737
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,040
if you don't keep your joints mobile,
that's the focus of shit. A diet.

738
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,000
You got to give your body the
building blocks to, to repair tissue.

739
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,630
You've got to give that tissue time
to repair. A lot of injuries come,

740
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:19,400
and this is from my personal experience,

741
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,550
the injury that I had on my
neck was from getting hurt.

742
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,410
And just continuing to work out,

743
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,530
like knowing I was hurt and
just just gutting it out.

744
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,190
Just a Jujitsu is so fun.
It's so fun that you don't want

745
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,390
to take too much time off. And when I
would take like two weeks off, like I,

746
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:39,090
I fucked something up in my neck,
I'd take two weeks off.

747
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:41,880
Like realistically I
needed several months off.

748
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:46,080
Like I had an injury and what I really
needed to do was take several months off

749
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:48,510
and rehab the area and
make sure it's strong,

750
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,030
but I would just heard it again
couple of months later, pop,

751
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:54,060
ah fuck it hurt again.
And it just kept hurting it.

752
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,570
He kept doing it over and over again
until I finally got an Mri after the worst

753
00:44:57,571 --> 00:45:01,020
one when I started getting numb fingers
and I found out that I had a bulging

754
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:04,530
disc in my neck,
but instead of getting surgery,

755
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:05,970
instead of getting my neck cut open,

756
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:09,000
I started doing what's
called spinal decompression.

757
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:10,590
I have this like a thing that I,

758
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,640
a harness I attached to my neck and I
put it to a door and I like hang myself

759
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:19,140
basically. Yeah, I started doing that
and a lot of stretching and then rolfing,

760
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,460
I started getting rolfed, which is fucking
really painful shit. Super painful.

761
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:26,700
And I started doing this stuff
called pro low ozone therapy.

762
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:30,930
Like I'm trying like really hard to
make sure that this area is completely

763
00:45:30,931 --> 00:45:33,960
healed up before I do anything crazy
again. It's smart. So then I did that.

764
00:45:33,961 --> 00:45:37,230
And then the most recent
is this re Regina Kine,

765
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,970
Regena kine is this a shit that this
guy doctor Peter Welling developed in

766
00:45:41,971 --> 00:45:45,990
Germany. They take your blood out
and they spin it and the other,

767
00:45:45,991 --> 00:45:48,270
the the heat up the blood
and then it produces,

768
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:52,500
I guess it produces more red or more
white blood cells and they spin it in a

769
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:54,720
centrifuge and it makes
us like yellow serum.

770
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:58,650
That's like one of the most potent
anti inflammatory drugs known to man.

771
00:45:58,651 --> 00:46:00,330
It's made by your own blood and I'm,

772
00:46:00,331 --> 00:46:04,530
I'm doing a terrible job of explaining
the science. I'm sure I butchered it,

773
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,390
but whatever it is, they take this
stuff, they take it out of your blood.

774
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:13,380
Then they inject it into where you have
injuries or inflammation and people feel

775
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:15,660
like they haven't felt in 20 years.
It's incredible.

776
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,080
Like he did it to my neck and
only a month ago, five weeks ago,

777
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,480
inject back into your neck.
Is that where a ghost,

778
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:26,250
they put like in very specific areas
where you have the inflammation,

779
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,630
they inject that,

780
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,500
that serum that's created from your
blood into that area where you have the

781
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:36,150
inflammation and it heals. It's so
quick. It's like you're in a movie.

782
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:37,081
Really?
Yeah.

783
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:42,081
It's like they created some new invention
to relieve yourself of inflammation.

784
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,430
You're basically on, this is
like cutting edge stuff, right?

785
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:46,890
I mean they're pretty cutting edge.
It's not even approved by the FDA.

786
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,070
You have to pay for it. Pay
for it out of pocket. Yeah.

787
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,620
You have to pay for it out of pocket.
Uh, in Germany they let you do it,

788
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:54,480
which is why all these athletes
were flying to Germany,

789
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:58,440
but now they're starting to set up places
in America and they do what's called,

790
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,500
um,
I think off label.

791
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,770
I think that's how I'd describe it off
label in which means like they can't

792
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:07,830
guarantee anything. They can't tell
you it's going to do anything for you.

793
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,350
The FDA doesn't approve it.
They can't say it's going to help you,

794
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:13,290
but they can do the procedure.
It's legal if you want to get it done.

795
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,830
Here's all the people that have done it
and here's how it benefited them. Wow.

796
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,090
It fucking works to my neck.
Feels amazing. It feels so loose.

797
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:24,780
It was like for the longest time. Is this
a video of them doing it? It was they,

798
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,410
they pulled out a eight ounces of blood
out of me today, son. Eight ounces. Yeah.

799
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,820
Lucky am very hot blooded.
I produce blood just sitting here.

800
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:36,880
I'm producing a lot of blood. They
shoot it, see how they're doing it here.

801
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:40,660
They put these little holes and then they
have this little thing that sticks in

802
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:45,130
the hole and they inject the serum
directly into the areas where you have

803
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:49,510
inflammation and people have had arthritis
and all sorts of different issues,

804
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:51,040
especially like lower back pain.

805
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,360
They've experienced some
pretty significant benefit
from doing this stuff and it

806
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:58,540
lasts for years. That's fascinating. Shit,

807
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:03,610
but you know these dudes that are
in a combat sports, whether it's um,

808
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,440
MMA or even football, it's just kind of
like a combat sport. It's very similar.

809
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,060
Yeah. You're going to get a beating
you, no matter what you do. Yeah.

810
00:48:12,061 --> 00:48:14,950
You met her who you are. Yeah. Peyton
manning actually had this shit done,

811
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,310
had it done to his neck. His
neck was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah.

812
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,400
Probably just like mine. Yeah, but
now he's playing again. It's crazy.

813
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,450
He's playing so well. It's
because of this shit, man. Yeah.

814
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,280
It's because of this Regina con.
This is just step one.

815
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:32,020
This motherfucker in Germany is a year
away from developing a shot that makes

816
00:48:32,021 --> 00:48:34,270
your body kickstarted to
production of Collagen,

817
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,040
which means your wrinkles will go away.

818
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,280
Really always kind of look odd is
fuck who they were in it. Right?

819
00:48:39,281 --> 00:48:40,480
They're going to watch out for that too.

820
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:44,350
Oh ladies are going to want some dicks
on how many you imagine if your next door

821
00:48:44,351 --> 00:48:47,920
neighbor was like this old lady who
was really hot at one point in time and

822
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:52,450
lived for it and then it all fell apart
and then she's by herself and alone and

823
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:56,320
she starts getting them shots
and then within like a year,

824
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:59,680
she's like a hot mill,
a hot 40 year old and you're like,

825
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:03,960
what the hell is going on?
Can I know some flower flirt and with Ya,

826
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,200
you catch her out in the morning.

827
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:08,640
She's doing exercises and she's
jogging on the front lawn.

828
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,960
She can work out again. Oh, what
the fuck is going on next door?

829
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:18,060
It's peaches going back in time.
She's eating babies. She must be band.

830
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,040
He didn't know any better. You would
think she's a witch. Of course.

831
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,650
If all the sudden within a year
she looked like a hot 40 year old,

832
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,290
give me that baby. I wonder if
that's possible. It's got to be,

833
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,360
they're going to do it.
If you eat,

834
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,860
if you could send a video through
the fucking sky instantaneously,

835
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,760
you can take a video.

836
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:36,610
You could send it to me from Canada
and I would get it within a couple of

837
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:39,100
seconds. Yeah, that's ridiculous.
That's possibly get that.

838
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,640
That's your neighbor bro. Yeah. Look
at that. And you're like ice cube.

839
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:44,800
Ice Cubes are rapey.
They're very raping.

840
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,480
I'm not done.
That was there.

841
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,720
Yeah, just like that.
Just like that. Yeah.

842
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,780
If that I get to be lady Tucker right
there and wait in that scenario. No,

843
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:05,120
you get to be Tommy buns. Okay. I
think you'd have a better response.

844
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:08,060
But Louis' dirty bitch.

845
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,753
Nothing.

846
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,290
Yeah, that's what we would, uh, that's
what we'd be dealing with everywhere.

847
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:20,070
All across the world.
A lot more fucking going on.

848
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,090
A lot more fucking the old guys
who become studs to, sure. Guys,

849
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:26,340
within a couple of years we'll start
looking like Stallone does now.

850
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:32,540
You imagine like successful guys like
guys who were real power brokers,

851
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,970
Murdock becomes the hawk.
Oh my God.

852
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:39,350
Literally looks like the Hulk and just
dropping dick internationally the door

853
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:42,350
with a custom suit on because
his neck is 37 inches wide.

854
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,750
These heads enormous and square,

855
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:48,530
and this is Rupert Murdoch becomes
like literally like Juggernaut. Yeah,

856
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,440
it becomes the hawk.

857
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:55,920
If someone came along and they did have
some sort of a genetic fix like you,

858
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,230
and especially if you're an old man,

859
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,980
if you're like 80 years old and they say
to you, well, we can give you this shot,

860
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:03,320
they will turn you into the shape.
You will.

861
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,920
You will more if you're going to eat
all day long because you're going to be

862
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:06,830
hungry constantly.

863
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:10,040
But if you give yourself the
required amount of calories to grow,

864
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:12,440
you're going to be this
and like a couple months,

865
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,750
you just fucking keep growing
old guys.

866
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:20,090
Be All all over it, man.
No question you did.

867
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:22,250
It just becomes like a Quaker oats box.

868
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:27,530
Just one of those big extra thick Quaker
oats boxes. I think you know what?

869
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:30,650
You'd be so charged up
and so sexually recharged.

870
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,530
You just be leaking Tj's all day.
Every week.

871
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,710
You'd have to put a little
like a little receiver,

872
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,870
a little receptacle at
the end of your cock.

873
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:41,510
You'd have to tie a very sturdy
balloon on the end of your tick.

874
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:42,770
Absolute tape it down.

875
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:46,430
Otherwise it just be shooting loads
in your pants all day and you just go.

876
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,490
You just literally have to drop them.
I think that Shit's inevitable.

877
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,060
They're doing things right now that
are the building blocks of creating

878
00:51:53,061 --> 00:51:55,370
superheroes. Like they have this, um,

879
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:00,410
this project where they're
trying to combine spider
silk with a, with human skin.

880
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,780
They're trying to make this synthetic skin
that would be like a replacement skin,

881
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,200
like burn people,
burn burn victims and you know,

882
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:13,370
and maybe people who just really wanted
to redo their whole body one day. Really?

883
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:18,020
Look, man, they're replacing hips. Okay.
What does a hip, a hip hippos. A joint.

884
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,920
They saw your fucking joint off
when you see a hip replacement.

885
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:25,790
It's some dark shit. Have you ever
watched it online? No. No, let's do it.

886
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,180
Let's watch a hip replacement.
It's rough.

887
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:34,330
They saw the end of your femur off son
and they screw this fucking bolt in

888
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:38,930
place. It's gnarly. I all
that shit. Surgery is gnarly.

889
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:44,090
Surgery is gnarly, but replacements of
joints, especially seeing a faceless,

890
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,060
but well yeah, that's Gnarley or
a nose job. Oh, that's not what,

891
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:50,090
I didn't see what my nose looks like.

892
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:54,020
But you saw some of the bloody boogers
after I had my nose fixed. I saw you,

893
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,490
remember I showed you those,

894
00:52:55,491 --> 00:52:58,640
you almost threw up one of the point
you had when you were putting that water

895
00:52:58,641 --> 00:53:02,900
pick up your nose. Yeah. And it was
flushing stuff out. Yeah. Let's, um,

896
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,880
maybe we shouldn't watch this,
so it looks like a ham.

897
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,060
They open you up and then they,

898
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:12,260
they cut off the end of your leg and
then attach this artificial joint.

899
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:14,930
Who was the first guy to make
a fucking artificial hip?

900
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,320
Cause that guy took a goddamn chance.
He really, he really, all right.

901
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:22,010
We're going in and I mean,
how many people,

902
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:25,980
how much did his hips suck? Where he was
like, cut my fucking leg off. Like, yeah,

903
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:30,270
the first guy. Yeah. Well, my
friend who had it done in New York,

904
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:33,450
according to our friend Brian Cowen,
he was um,

905
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,700
he was walking so bad like he,

906
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,550
one leg would bend and the other
leg he would just sort of swing.

907
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,040
He would swing it over.

908
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:44,250
He would keep it attached to his body and
like sorta swing his body sideways and

909
00:53:44,251 --> 00:53:48,150
that's how he moved forward. He didn't use
his hip. This a fighter guy? No, no, no.

910
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:51,720
He put just played basketball
on a concrete in New York City,

911
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,420
played a lot of basketball and
he was like 50. Now is legacy.

912
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,520
There's another one like,

913
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,520
have you seen like the way some of
these old basketball players walk?

914
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,390
Holy Shit ever. Really
big too. They're monsters.

915
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,910
You think when you're talking
about a seven foot human,

916
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:10,200
the amount of like torque that goes
on to all these different joints,

917
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:12,180
the ankles and the knees and the hips.

918
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,780
There's so much pressure because you're
dealing with is extremely long lever.

919
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,130
It's one of the reasons why
like long legged and long
armed guys punched so hard.

920
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,830
It's also one of the reasons why
they're so good at submissions.

921
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:27,390
They have like extra leverage because
they're, their limbs are literally longer.

922
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,080
They have more of a better
fulcrum and that makes sense.

923
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:34,400
But it also puts tremendous
pressure on your joints because the,

924
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,120
have you ever seen Phil Jackson Walk in
recent years? Yeah. Oh my God. You know,

925
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:44,000
he was a player for a lot of years.
His walk is the most like it's,

926
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:47,610
you see the pain when you're watching,
you're like, that guy's walking in pain.

927
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:51,090
Well, when I was a kid I worked
at the Boston Athletic Club,

928
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,700
which is a health club in South
Boston. Nice place. And uh,

929
00:54:55,950 --> 00:55:00,120
people would come in there
and play racquetball lot
and Bobby or he used to come

930
00:55:00,121 --> 00:55:03,000
in there all the time. Oh yeah. One of
the greatest hockey players of all time,

931
00:55:03,001 --> 00:55:06,510
all time. And when I was
there, I was about 19 and a,

932
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,670
I don't know how old Bobby was.
He was probably about my age.

933
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:13,440
Now I'm 46 and he couldn't walk.
Ban. Really? Oh Man. I mean,

934
00:55:13,441 --> 00:55:18,150
not only could he not walk, he has his
sides of his legs were cut open like fish,

935
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:23,010
like the,
the scars that they put on his legs.

936
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:26,280
Like he's probably older than me.
He's probably now that I think about it,

937
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:29,670
he was probably older than me then. I bet
he was probably in his fifties but the,

938
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,830
the old way of doing it,

939
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:36,090
they would just open you up like a fish
and then they would take chunks of your

940
00:55:36,091 --> 00:55:36,630
leg,

941
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:40,590
like your hamstring and it's screw them
in place and try to replace ligaments

942
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:41,130
with them.

943
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,830
And they would last for a little while
and then they blow out so they'd have to

944
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:48,831
fucking stitch you up again and Bobby or
had something insane like 17 surgeries.

945
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:53,490
So when he walked, man he couldn't,
he literally couldn't bend his knees.

946
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,170
So he would like kind of hop and move is
like for her to put it down and lift up

947
00:55:58,171 --> 00:55:59,670
and move is like forward to put it down.

948
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,650
And there was a machine called
a versa climber, a verse,

949
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:05,160
a Columbia ever seen one of those things,
great cardio machine.

950
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,040
Get on there and you fucking go crazy
with this thing. He couldn't get on it.

951
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,760
We used to have to help him on it. We
used to have to help him lift his leg up.

952
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,070
And when you looked at them,
if you looked at his face,

953
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,100
looked like a real healthy guy. He
wasn't out of shape. He wasn't, you know,

954
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:21,570
overweight. His just, his legs were
gone is so fucking brutal though.

955
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:24,490
Oh rain. It's, think about
it. You're sliding around

956
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:28,230
and you're on ice. Yeah. Knees are
going every fucking which way. You know,

957
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,820
you like lamb 40 miles an
hour. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy.
Yeah. And once your knees go,

958
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,830
you know they're going to keep going.
Yeah.

959
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:40,831
I know that Dick [inaudible] hasn't been
able to like walk normal for so long

960
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,170
while, and he's, you know, he's
probably like 70 or something now,

961
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:48,550
but he hasn't been walking normal
in 15 years. Plus, you know,

962
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:51,580
because those guys,
guys like Bobby or Mike Ditka played,

963
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:55,180
you know so long ago that they would just,

964
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,270
they really didn't do the most
important thing when you're hurt,

965
00:56:58,271 --> 00:57:02,590
which is like take time off. It was
like nobody did back then fucking play.

966
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,730
Yeah. You know, obviously
that's especially relevant
when it comes to concussions.

967
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:07,600
Oh yeah.

968
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,630
Cause they're really just starting to
kind of get a grasp on that within the

969
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:14,790
last 10 years. So it's like what kind of
regulations that she just played. Yes,

970
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:18,970
sure. Especially if you were
everywhere. Absolutely. Absolutely.

971
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:22,060
Like toughen up pussy. Toughen
up. Yeah. And they would,

972
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:25,030
and they were doing and it
was so not about being tough.

973
00:57:25,031 --> 00:57:26,110
Those guys are submitting,

974
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:30,740
those guys should have been not having
any contact for weeks or months.

975
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,020
Yeah. They were just rocking
their brain for week after week.

976
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:38,590
Probably multiple concussions in
the same week. Yeah, man. Crazy.

977
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,430
All these guys that keep dying and
shooting themselves in the heart so that

978
00:57:41,431 --> 00:57:46,060
people can examine their brain. Just
that alone. It's like God, it's so dark.

979
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,290
Yeah.
Early onset Alzheimer's dementia,

980
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,070
and they're like 45 50 yeah.

981
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:58,500
I think they're very close to being able
to figure out how to regenerate human

982
00:57:58,511 --> 00:58:01,820
tissue and they're, I think they're going
to be able to turn back the clock. Yeah.

983
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:04,690
I think within a hundred years
it's going to be, I mean,

984
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:05,890
you and I might not see it,

985
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,140
but I think they're very
close to being able to create,

986
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,290
literally create superheroes.
If you think about,

987
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:14,560
look what people have accomplished in
such a short amount of time and what they

988
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:19,561
can do now as far as like gene therapy
and using stem cells to heal things like

989
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:24,250
bas Rutten went down to another
country to get a stem cell treatment,

990
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,090
some South American country. We've got
some stem cell treatment because he,

991
00:58:28,091 --> 00:58:32,710
he's had like significant atrophy of his
arm because of a pinched nerve in his

992
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:36,760
neck. He had like some serious neck
injuries from fighting a little bit,

993
00:58:36,761 --> 00:58:40,270
but really from stunt work that he did
after fighting, really fell on his neck,

994
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:44,320
fucked himself up bad. He's got
his neck fused, his discs were bad,

995
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:48,730
so they cause this out and fuse his neck
and there was a lot of problems with it.

996
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,760
So he went and got this stem cell thing
and then all of a sudden he's feeling

997
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:55,330
fucking fantastic. He's talking about
how great he feels. Really. Yeah,

998
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:57,940
it feels great.
He's talking about was his body's growing.

999
00:58:57,941 --> 00:59:00,280
He's been doing all this exercise
again for the first time,

1000
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:03,730
like really intense exercise and he's
like not fitting into a suits anymore.

1001
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:04,980
It's got to change the,
the,

1002
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:08,440
the collars and the suits because
he can work out again. Wow. Yeah.

1003
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,270
You have to imagine that like if they
master that, all that genetic stuff,

1004
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,300
that one of those mad
scientist is going to be like,

1005
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,560
let's build the best fighter ever.
Let's build

1006
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:26,270
the best basketball player ever.
Like genetically make somebody like that.

1007
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,030
You know what I mean? Like, and
people will abuse that for sure.

1008
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,500
People got to do it for their kids.

1009
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:35,270
Of course they're kids are
going to be superheroes. Yeah.
It's gotta be weird, man.

1010
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,230
I'm telling you,
we're,

1011
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:40,970
we're probably a hundred years away from
a time where genetic improvements are

1012
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:44,510
like cell phones. Everybody
has it just, we just have it.

1013
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,630
It'll be real expensive at first and only
the elite. We'll be able to afford it.

1014
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,730
And then as time goes on, yeah, it'd
be more and more common and prevalent.

1015
00:59:50,731 --> 00:59:51,590
Just like a cell phone.

1016
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:56,000
And then you got to wonder what will be
the common problem associated with doing

1017
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:58,850
it because there's always a hangup to
something like that, you know? Well,

1018
00:59:58,851 --> 01:00:03,500
there's probably going to be people
that try to almost die and then bring

1019
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:06,560
themselves back and think it's funny
and they'll do it on youtube, right?

1020
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:06,861
You know,

1021
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:10,100
they'll have friends shoot them with
like 50 millimeter guns here and then

1022
01:00:10,101 --> 01:00:11,900
they'll uh, regenerate, regenerate.

1023
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:16,220
How awesome was that fucking shrink
back up and he'll just like wolverine.

1024
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,483
That's a,
yeah,

1025
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:20,750
we're going to have a lot of problems
when it comes to technology and the next

1026
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,790
hundred years or so in
the real problem is,

1027
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,000
will it ever get to a point where the
amount of power that people have does,

1028
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:33,050
it doesn't measure up with the amount of
responsibility they have and the amount

1029
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:37,220
of respect they have for that power.

1030
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,400
That's kind of where we're at right now
when it comes to being able to contact

1031
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:41,390
people on Youtube.

1032
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,960
Like if you find someone puts a video
up expressing their opinion and you're

1033
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:48,530
like, you fucking ugly con,
I want to eat you alive.

1034
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,410
And people that say crazy
shit like that on youtube,

1035
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,860
like they shouldn't have the ability to
just communicate with people like that.

1036
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:56,480
It shouldn't have the ability to just,

1037
01:00:56,630 --> 01:01:01,630
they're abusing and incredible power
you to just instantaneously communicate

1038
01:01:02,151 --> 01:01:03,380
with someone anonymously.

1039
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,650
Well that's the thing is you should
be able to do it with accountability.

1040
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,410
But even when the accountability,
like what kind of accountability,

1041
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:12,680
if I can't see you and you, no one's
looking at you and know what's going man,

1042
01:01:12,681 --> 01:01:16,160
you're a piece of shit. You know, if
you say something to someone in person,

1043
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,860
like the way people say
something on Youtube,

1044
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:22,970
like say if you're in the lobby of a
hotel and you see some guy just say some

1045
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:27,410
fucking horrible thing to a another
guy there, you would go like, Whoa,

1046
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:32,390
that guy's an asshole.
But if that happens to you online,

1047
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:35,780
if some guy, some guy just sends
you something horrible online,

1048
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:39,500
you don't see him and I don't see him
and nobody knows who this guy is and he's

1049
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,570
XP 49 k on Youtube or whatever his,
his youtube handle is.

1050
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:49,970
He doesn't feel that. He doesn't feel
the repercussions of that. You know?

1051
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:53,480
It's almost like you have
this incredible ability,

1052
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:57,200
but you don't have any responsibility
that comes along with it.

1053
01:01:57,201 --> 01:02:00,380
You don't have any ethics that go along
with it because you don't respect it.

1054
01:02:00,381 --> 01:02:03,560
You didn't develop it yourself. They
just got online. You know? It's like,

1055
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:06,780
it's so easy to just get online.
You know?

1056
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,930
You don't even have to have your
own computer because your computer,

1057
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,180
you get online and remember you're
going to Carroll full queue.

1058
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,820
You can do anything you want that,
that,

1059
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:17,870
that access is so common
that people who don't,

1060
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,440
you know, they probably are too
stupid for anything that powerful.

1061
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:24,450
That's the same argument about guns.

1062
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:28,980
It's the same argument about a lot of
different things and dangerous thing is

1063
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:32,160
those people are also unhappy. Right?
And that's why they're doing so.

1064
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,160
If you're that unhappy, but now your
power is genetic mutation, you know,

1065
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:40,680
it's a little different than than
saying, go fuck yourself. Well,

1066
01:02:40,681 --> 01:02:42,840
you know what it is
ultimately all of that,

1067
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:45,960
and I'm not saying that it's not the
people's responsibility who do it,

1068
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:51,110
but ultimately all shit
behavior is a real risk.

1069
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:54,750
The one of the real results of it is
the fact that we don't address that as a

1070
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:56,460
culture,
as being a major issue,

1071
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,700
that we don't address it as
a culture that we don't have.

1072
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:02,310
It reinforced in the kids'
heads at an early age,

1073
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:07,050
that the way to get by in life is to be
as nice to as many people as possible

1074
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,610
and a lot of times when you have bad
feelings and you feel bad or there's anger

1075
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:12,480
or jealousy,

1076
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:18,100
oftentimes this can be because you need
to fix your own life oftentimes and you

1077
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:23,070
need to get your own life in order where
you don't feel jealous about someone or

1078
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:25,980
you don't feel anger for something
that someone has that you want,

1079
01:03:25,981 --> 01:03:29,430
like use it as fuel to fix your life.
Nobody teaches do that.

1080
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,980
Nobody tells you that in school.
It never gets brought up.

1081
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:37,220
And then we also never deal with poor
people as if they're just people that are

1082
01:03:37,861 --> 01:03:41,640
a part of our community that have a
way worse position in life than we do.

1083
01:03:41,641 --> 01:03:45,990
And we need to fix that because it's
the lowest ring. A rung of the chain.

1084
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,720
We would just crawl. Yeah, got
the chance on wrong, wrong,

1085
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,940
but rung sounds like a ladder, like rung
on the ladder, rung of a chain link, link,

1086
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,120
link of a chain, but the lowest, okay.

1087
01:03:57,121 --> 01:04:00,900
Rung of the ladder that you
know, that's us. That's us.

1088
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:03,480
Just because we don't talk to them.
It's still us.

1089
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:06,960
Don't they live like a mile from us?
Well then that's us, but we ignore them.

1090
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:09,960
It's easier to ignore him.
But as a society,

1091
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:13,980
that should be like one of the first
things that a government takes care of.

1092
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:18,030
Extreme poverty, extreme poverty and
children growing up in extreme poverty.

1093
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,550
That's the big one.
Not just extreme poverty.

1094
01:04:20,551 --> 01:04:23,940
If you're a fucking guy and you're 35
years old and you decide you just love

1095
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:27,120
math and you're just gonna mess
it up and fucking do, but that's,

1096
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:30,540
that's your decision. If you went from
being a lawyer to be in a meth head.

1097
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:30,691
I mean,

1098
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:34,680
I'm not saying it's not in part based
on how fucked up your childhood was.

1099
01:04:34,681 --> 01:04:38,730
It probably was, but you might
be too far to fix. But Kid, yeah,

1100
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,480
you can fix kids, man. Catch
him early and it said so.

1101
01:04:42,481 --> 01:04:47,481
It's so bad for everyone when you have
that level of poverty because you have

1102
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:51,360
resentment. And of course a lot of
crime is resentment. It's not just need,

1103
01:04:51,361 --> 01:04:53,310
it's resentment and
need to give everything.

1104
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:58,311
I have nothing and no morals
because everybody around
you is doing whatever they

1105
01:04:58,441 --> 01:04:59,880
have to do to get by.

1106
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,970
You're just dealing in an environment
where you're dealing with a lot of people

1107
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:04,230
in and out of jail.

1108
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:08,550
So depressing and you don't see
any examples of how to get out.

1109
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,930
And there's so many people to like, people
always presume, a lot of people in, in,

1110
01:05:12,931 --> 01:05:17,070
in, in the United States presume
that extreme poverty is, you know,

1111
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:17,980
the favelas

1112
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,120
in Brazil,
which it is,

1113
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:22,840
but they don't realize that
there is extreme poverty
in this country and they're

1114
01:05:22,841 --> 01:05:26,320
strict poverty in Los Angeles. Sure
you can go to one economy in the world.

1115
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:27,760
We have a lot of extreme poverty.

1116
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,390
Yeah. And I don't know, I mean, look,

1117
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:34,770
I'm not saying that people don't have to
pull themselves up by their bootstraps,

1118
01:05:34,771 --> 01:05:37,740
that people don't have to work hard
in order to be successful. They do.

1119
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:40,410
Absolutely.
But you can't tell me that.

1120
01:05:40,411 --> 01:05:45,411
Like me growing up in Newton upper
falls and some poor fucking kid who is

1121
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:50,520
growing up in the worst area of Compton
and his mom's a crack head and his, uh,

1122
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:53,470
his dad is nonexistent and
everyone he knows is in,

1123
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:56,410
in and out of jail and they
have guns everywhere is,

1124
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,200
and people die around them all the time.

1125
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:01,530
That's a reality that we don't have to
deal with it I never had to deal with.

1126
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:06,600
But there's people growing up in that
reality that if they had options of

1127
01:06:06,601 --> 01:06:09,930
something to look forward to,
it can enhance how they develop.

1128
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,380
They don't think about that.
It's the weirdest thing.

1129
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:16,500
It's the weirdest thing about like the
money that gets dedicated in this society,

1130
01:06:16,501 --> 01:06:17,520
like where it goes.

1131
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:22,940
The fact that we put so much fucking
money into a war and so little money into

1132
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:28,800
making sure that we have a good supply
of people who are bad motherfuckers,

1133
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:32,190
people who can get their shit together,
people who can contribute to society,

1134
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,460
people who were people
who are contributors.

1135
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:41,130
The other thing is the percentage of
people who make up the portion of income

1136
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:46,630
like that.
You have so many,

1137
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:52,240
so few ultra rich that make up
such a huge amount of the income.

1138
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,580
So you have basically,
you know this,

1139
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:02,670
this person is 5% you know people always
talk about the was the the the top two

1140
01:07:02,741 --> 01:07:05,570
or whatever labor centers, the
one percenters. But like you know,

1141
01:07:05,571 --> 01:07:10,571
you have like 5% in the United States
that might make up 30 some percent of of

1142
01:07:12,131 --> 01:07:16,630
the, of all the income and hold an
even bigger percentage of the wealth.

1143
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:20,860
You have a very small percentage of people
controlling a whole hell of a lot of

1144
01:07:20,861 --> 01:07:25,750
money. That's why it's a, at least on
some level, it's so it's good that,

1145
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:30,160
but like the gates started that giving
pledge where they basically try to get

1146
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,520
the world's billionaires to sign up
to give away 95% of their net worth.

1147
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:39,670
But you know,
by the time they die,

1148
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:43,840
so people that are worth
five and 10 and $20 billion,

1149
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:47,290
we'll at least not hold on to that.
They'll give it away.

1150
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,770
Because if you, the thing about
growing up in that environment,

1151
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:54,520
if you grow up and your,
you know, your dad makes,

1152
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:59,250
he dad has $100 billion. What, what? Yeah,

1153
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:03,700
so you just get a trust and you don't ever
have to work ever even met those guys.

1154
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,160
Sure. That's just some sad
motherfuckers. They always are.

1155
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,230
There's some sad motherfuckers.
I knew this dude,

1156
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,700
he had a trust and then a backup trust
and he went through both of them and now

1157
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:17,030
he has a job. Yeah. He,
he millions, I believe.

1158
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:21,650
30 something million dollars on real
estate development that didn't go through.

1159
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,590
And then he had a backup
trust and that went away too.

1160
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:27,050
And then his parents finally
just, they said, get a job bitch,

1161
01:08:27,051 --> 01:08:31,250
and he's like 50 and he's like
finally in like the workforce.

1162
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:34,760
She 50 they cut him loose after just
going through all of his buddies.

1163
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,900
He's the weakest man. Like I think one
of the weakest men have ever been around.

1164
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:43,520
Not Surprising. She says no
character, no ability to,

1165
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:44,780
and he even said it.

1166
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:48,740
He was talking to my friend about
her kids and he said if I can,

1167
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,350
if I could give any piece of
advice and what not to do,

1168
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,340
never let them think that they don't
have to work. You never let them think.

1169
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:56,174
They don't have to work

1170
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,650
the, you're a lottery
winner. Yeah. That's the,

1171
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,300
the only difference is you won your
lottery the moment you were born.

1172
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:05,070
But isn't it possible to win the lottery
and keep it together? Where signage,

1173
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:07,780
very rare. It's very rare. It's possible.

1174
01:09:07,930 --> 01:09:09,280
And I'm sure there's
people who have done it,

1175
01:09:09,281 --> 01:09:14,050
but there's more stories about how this
guy fucking fucked everything up as soon

1176
01:09:14,051 --> 01:09:17,710
as he won the lottery than there
are. Wow. This guy, you know,

1177
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:19,870
live the fairytale life
after he won the lottery.

1178
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:23,560
I think some of it has to do with
the amount you win. You know,

1179
01:09:23,561 --> 01:09:28,540
you can win a lottery. You could win $1
million, you can win two, five $6 million.

1180
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:33,640
When you start talking about somebody
that was making 35,000 a year in the

1181
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:38,641
factory and you get 102
hundred $300 million,

1182
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:41,470
I mean there's nothing
to prepare you for that.

1183
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:44,020
There's nothing to prepare
you for that and the,

1184
01:09:44,021 --> 01:09:46,510
the type of attention you're
going to get from that,

1185
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,910
the people that are going to come
into your life, it's overwhelming.

1186
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:50,560
Why they're not ready for it.

1187
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:55,590
It'd be different if like you won $100
million because you've achieved success

1188
01:09:57,191 --> 01:10:01,060
on your own. You know, you
know, it's, it's still going
to be a difference for you.

1189
01:10:01,061 --> 01:10:06,061
But I think having a foundation of like
a career that you've taken on and earn

1190
01:10:07,001 --> 01:10:07,311
drone,
you know,

1191
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:10,690
you earn what you've gotten to
have this boost would be different.

1192
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,720
I think when you haven't had that level
of success and you get something like,

1193
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:21,100
you know, a nine figure check, I think
it's really hard to keep it together.

1194
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:25,030
There's more stories about disaster and
there are about keeping it together.

1195
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,660
When you talk about those big, the
the, what are the big ones called?

1196
01:10:28,661 --> 01:10:32,140
They're like the mega millions
powerball, right? Yeah.

1197
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:34,230
If somebody just won a nut,

1198
01:10:34,231 --> 01:10:39,231
like over three three
53 55 so much though,

1199
01:10:40,031 --> 01:10:43,750
what did they pay them off? They're like,
you have options. You can get options.

1200
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,183
Here's the,

1201
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:50,250
if you are not 80 you should
always take no the opposite.

1202
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,570
Yeah,
the 20 year,

1203
01:10:52,571 --> 01:10:57,571
because you're essentially on
salary for the next 2025 years,

1204
01:10:57,731 --> 01:10:59,980
so if you want $100 million,
right?

1205
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:04,981
You're going to get 20 payments over the
course of a t to add up to that amount.

1206
01:11:05,051 --> 01:11:07,540
You're gonna have to pay taxes,
but you're going to get your full amount.

1207
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:11,440
The other option they do is they
go, all right, it's 355 million.

1208
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:14,040
You could take that over 20 years or we'll

1209
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,540
give you like 158 million right now and
then people go, I'll take the lumps.

1210
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,340
It's more, you know, they was
all the money then. Right,

1211
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,500
but unless you're about to die,

1212
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:25,920
like why wouldn't you just allow
yourself to earn like what's,

1213
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:30,090
maybe you would be worried that they
would go under continue to pay you. Yeah,

1214
01:11:30,091 --> 01:11:33,630
I guess they that that is probably the
worry that's not going to fucking happen,

1215
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,960
but what you really trust that someone's
going to stay alive or a business is

1216
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:39,150
going to stay alive for 25
years or whatever it is.

1217
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,100
They would still be obligated
to make that payment.

1218
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:44,730
What I'm saying is like if they
go under the state lottery,

1219
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:47,190
I don't think it goes under.
What if it did it in Detroit?

1220
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,290
What have you bought
the lottery in Detroit?

1221
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,910
I still think that we ain't got no money.
I still think you'd,

1222
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:55,590
you'd still get your money? I think
so. I do. I don't think there's,

1223
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:59,550
I don't think there's such thing as them.
I say take them on and take that lumps.

1224
01:11:59,551 --> 01:12:03,690
Asked it in a good business, Tom, we
buns. I think if it's a family restaurant,

1225
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,560
I would definitely do that. The 25 year
payout, how much you think you would get.

1226
01:12:07,561 --> 01:12:12,390
Okay, let's see if you win the lottery
and you get $350 million, right?

1227
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:15,780
So what's the yearly
payout on 355 million?

1228
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:18,780
I would say they'd probably
do it over 25 years right now.

1229
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:24,120
So let's see. Um, let's say,

1230
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:27,990
let's say you're getting
three 55 over 25 years,

1231
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:29,550
that's 14 million a year,
man.

1232
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:32,080
What if you want to buy
something that's more than 50?

1233
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:37,110
The thing is you can get whatever you
want. Once they like you have that,

1234
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:40,620
they know who you are and they
see like there's no way. And like,

1235
01:12:40,621 --> 01:12:45,030
what the fuck are your plans, man? Are
you opening the fucking the new St Regis?

1236
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:49,730
Like why you don't need you? You were
doing your shit for whatever, 50 grand,

1237
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:53,970
you're fine. You have 14 million a
year for the next quarter century.

1238
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,760
You've got to change your phone number
and move immediately. Oh my God,

1239
01:12:56,761 --> 01:12:58,620
you have the amount of people
that are going to hit you up.

1240
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:01,440
Just give me a million.
You could just give me a million.

1241
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:04,750
You still have all that money all
the time. Come on dude. You friends,

1242
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:08,520
14 million a year. You can't give me
a million a year. And you have to say,

1243
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:11,610
imagine people are going to ask
you to give them $1 million a year.

1244
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,170
Do you get 14 million a year? Give
me 1 million a year. Come on man.

1245
01:13:16,171 --> 01:13:18,000
You got to be like, you know
whether it's a really good argument,

1246
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,700
but I'm going to have to say
no like you make a good point.

1247
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:24,390
What would you do if Matt full
tron one are you good? Play Tommy,

1248
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:28,770
you won $300 million. You can't give
me a million a year. I love you man.

1249
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,060
But nothing. You give them nothing. Now
I probably would give. Yeah, I would,

1250
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:37,290
but I don't think you could let people
dictate the terms and how much you have

1251
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:39,500
to give. Whatever you
want to give. You know?

1252
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:42,740
It's weird when someone starts
asking you from a good friend.

1253
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:45,210
I wanted to give him a weird number.
You know, what would you give them?

1254
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:50,130
138 216,000 yeah,
but that's it.

1255
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:53,220
You make 300 million, he gets to
give you a hundred grand. All right,

1256
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:55,260
well I mean Christmas was coming up.
It might give you a bonus.

1257
01:13:57,900 --> 01:14:02,510
Would you start a business
that much money? I think. Um,

1258
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:04,920
why would you,
what do you need to make more money?

1259
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:08,580
Why would you start a business
so you could lose some of it? No,

1260
01:14:08,581 --> 01:14:12,100
I think the first thing I would do is move

1261
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:16,270
like to the air,
like the exact whatever area.

1262
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:20,290
Neighborhood Home I desire the
most that way. Would that be,

1263
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:24,130
I don't know. Maybe Hawaii. Hawaii, maybe.

1264
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:26,500
I didn't have to travel
to see your friends.

1265
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:31,000
The problem a wise it's five hours away
by plane. I know, but I got the jet now.

1266
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,820
Just hop on the jet.
It takes five hours in a plane.

1267
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,030
If you live five hours drive
from somewhere, what's five?

1268
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:40,420
How annoying would that be? I know, but
I mean, come on man, I'm sending my jet.

1269
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:43,210
Are you going to be a real, it's a
really nice, okay. How about this?

1270
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,780
How about I live in the mountains.
Five hours drive up the top of a mountain.

1271
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,440
How often are you going to visit me?
But can I have a second home in Hawaii?

1272
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,460
Yes. You could have a second home in
Hawaii, but where are you going to live?

1273
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:58,270
Primary residence. That's a good
question. Let me give up on Hollywood.

1274
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,250
I mean I think the motivation
here anymore. Well yeah,

1275
01:15:01,251 --> 01:15:03,430
I mean but I mean cause you can
just stand up from anywhere.

1276
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:06,760
If I started doing standup he wouldn't
eat their fucking whore money. Yeah,

1277
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:10,600
there God damn devil do whatever I want.
That's a great, that's a great actual,

1278
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:14,870
it's just where do you want to live
the most? Where would it be? Um,

1279
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:17,170
I still love California.
Maybe.

1280
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,810
Maybe either summer beach. I
like the beaches. So maybe Santa,

1281
01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:25,840
Barbara's Nice Santa Barbara. Maybe look
more relaxed, less people. Beach Front,

1282
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:30,820
Laguna beach kind of thing. Newport
that area. That's kind of Nice so far.

1283
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:35,050
Um, Santa Barbara is beautiful.
But then I also love, I mean fuck,

1284
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:39,790
I mean if you have $350
million, you probably buy
your houses wherever you want.

1285
01:15:39,791 --> 01:15:44,320
Buy a house in Seattle and New York
where you decided to live. Definitely.

1286
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:47,950
Look at you. You love cows. I Love
California. Do you represent? Yeah.

1287
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:51,730
Do you wear like an la hat fucking
heart? People know you represent. Yeah,

1288
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,350
it's fun. I love it. I would defend it.

1289
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:59,370
What people live in shitty places and
they have the nerve to shit on where we

1290
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:01,420
live. It's, it's unbelievable.

1291
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:05,050
You do these fucking dog shit towns
and they're like, you live in La.

1292
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:08,290
I'd never want to go there. I'm
like, clearly you have shit taste.

1293
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:11,800
I'm here because they're paying me.
I can't wait to get the fuck out.

1294
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:15,250
So you stay man, stay here. We
don't need you at all. Well,

1295
01:16:15,251 --> 01:16:19,910
people's ideas of California being bad
or never visited half the time they're

1296
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:23,980
like, it's their idea of what California
is. That it's all Kanye west out here.

1297
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:26,200
It's like a hundred million Kanye West.
Yeah.

1298
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:30,250
But he's yelling and I'm the greatest
ever. And then Christina has the best,

1299
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,150
the best, uh, a story
of a, it was a baggage,

1300
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:38,140
a baggage handler at the
airport in Detroit and he's
putting the bag tag on her

1301
01:16:38,141 --> 01:16:41,650
bag and it says lax, like you live in
La. And she's like, yeah. He's like,

1302
01:16:41,651 --> 01:16:43,780
I don't want any part of that
shit. She was like, you're fucking,

1303
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:47,680
you're putting tags on bags and Detroit.
You don't want to check out la.

1304
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:50,720
Like what the fuck is your
problem? And he like, well,

1305
01:16:50,721 --> 01:16:53,230
it's all that celebrity shit.
That's the other thing is they go,

1306
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:57,460
the city is red carpet.
Like they think that it's like,

1307
01:16:57,850 --> 01:17:01,120
and they think that because you live in
La, let's say, and you're not a celebrity,

1308
01:17:01,121 --> 01:17:05,070
they're like, you must be obsessed
with celebrity culture. Yeah.

1309
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:08,440
That's the perception. Like, Oh,
you're out there chasing celebrities.

1310
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:10,330
Like what are you talking about man?
Yeah.

1311
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,850
I've heard guys also say ridiculous
shit. Like, you know, you,

1312
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:15,980
you couldn't ever meet
a girl out here man,

1313
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,760
because a girls just want to
be famous dudes in La. Yeah.

1314
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:23,030
How many famous people do you think there
are just regular guys get laid to out

1315
01:17:23,031 --> 01:17:26,810
here? Oh, for sure. What are you talking
about? Like what, what's this based on?

1316
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:30,440
What studies did you, the funny thing
too is for people that don't live here,

1317
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,500
even like whether you're a performer,

1318
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:36,470
whether you're working in any type
of the entertainment business at all,

1319
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:40,550
for the most part when you're in
La and people spot celebrities,

1320
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:44,450
nobody gives a shit.
It's the opposite of outside of La.

1321
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:49,070
Like people see celebrities at most
that I've ever seen is people are like,

1322
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:53,120
how's it going man? Big Fan. Like
nobody, people mind their business in La.

1323
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:56,480
It's a big difference between that and
a place where they don't get to see

1324
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,600
somebody who is on TV and a regular basis.
Yeah. Becomes passe on here. Like, oh,

1325
01:17:59,601 --> 01:18:04,070
there's that guy. Yeah. Which is probably
better, you know? Sure. Definitely better.

1326
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:06,110
Yeah.
You stand out less.

1327
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:10,940
And I totally feel like
the, um, the Cliche,

1328
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:16,400
what weather conversation
that we all have is, it's,

1329
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,280
you know, when people are like,
it's overdone, it's underdone, it's,

1330
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,730
it's not spoken about enough.
Whether it's everything.

1331
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:27,470
Don't act like having great weather isn't
one of the greatest perks of where you

1332
01:18:27,471 --> 01:18:32,450
live or, or the worst part of where you
live. It's w we were talking about that.

1333
01:18:32,451 --> 01:18:35,090
Like everybody talk. Yeah, it's
cause it's fucking awesome here.

1334
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:40,120
It's amazing and it's amazing about 96%
of the time and we're going to act like

1335
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:44,030
that doesn't play a huge part and why
this place is great. Of course it is, man.

1336
01:18:44,090 --> 01:18:47,590
It does. But I gotta be honest, I like
it when it rains here as it rains.

1337
01:18:47,590 --> 01:18:51,410
So rarely I liked, I liked
that it mixes up. It's fun.

1338
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:52,670
Of course you'd like to change,

1339
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:57,671
but the fact that like there are people
suffering for not a day or a week,

1340
01:18:58,310 --> 01:19:02,330
months and months of the year and you
have the fucking top down in your car.

1341
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,900
Like it's not really something that
you can ignore. It's pretty fantastic.

1342
01:19:05,901 --> 01:19:08,750
And it's sunny, sunny, not just nice out.

1343
01:19:08,751 --> 01:19:12,980
Like temperature wise you get sun and
you feel it and it feels good. Oh yeah.

1344
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:16,070
And there's the ocean with
fucking sailboat going by
what a nice day it is today.

1345
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:21,620
Okay. Yeah, it sucks. Everything sucks.

1346
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:24,480
I think for a lot of people
that say la socks, there's,

1347
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,880
there's a bunch of factors. The
traffic is a big one. The fake,

1348
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:34,250
uh, fakeness, fake
communication that you get here,

1349
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,570
the fake people.

1350
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:38,870
You get a lot of fake shit here as
opposed to like what you get in the east

1351
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:43,340
coast, you get you, you get
more authenticity I think,

1352
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,260
on a,
in,

1353
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:47,900
in places where people have to deal with
weather and people don't deal as much

1354
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:52,670
with actors. Yeah. It's part of the,
it's one of the downsides of this area,

1355
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:56,450
but it's not enough of a downside
that it makes it suck. Right.

1356
01:19:56,451 --> 01:20:00,230
The traffic is enough. That makes sense.
But can I say one thing about traffic?

1357
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,310
Traffic here is terrible. Yeah.
New York City, Washington, DC,

1358
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:08,160
Atlanta, Miami, Houston, all these

1359
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:13,160
cities have absolutely disastrous rush
hours and traffic all the fucking time.

1360
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,740
If you want to live in
a big metropolitan area,

1361
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:18,750
it's just one of the things
that comes with it. Yeah.

1362
01:20:18,751 --> 01:20:23,130
If you want to try to drive from Long
Island into Manhattan, Oh my God.

1363
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,480
You want to try and do it in the morning.
Get to word luck dude.

1364
01:20:25,490 --> 01:20:29,550
Good luck with that one. So I couldn't
believe it. I couldn't believe the line.

1365
01:20:29,551 --> 01:20:30,384
I was like this is,

1366
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:35,510
I was staying in Long Island and driving
into New York for something while ago.

1367
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:38,340
Yeah. And uh, I remember
being on the highway going,

1368
01:20:38,341 --> 01:20:41,910
if I had to do this every day I
probably go fucking crazy. Yeah.

1369
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,720
Cause it was hours and it's
because of the fucking toll too.

1370
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:49,440
That's another level of bullshit that you
have to deal with in New York that you

1371
01:20:49,441 --> 01:20:52,520
don't have to deal with here. Everywhere
you go fucking costs you money. Yeah.

1372
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:56,670
Everywhere, every fucking
bridge. The turnpike, Turnpike,

1373
01:20:56,840 --> 01:21:00,000
you got to stop all the time
he stopped and he got to pay.

1374
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:03,360
Aren't those fees now like
create like a deal money,

1375
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:07,770
14 bucks mean that like that's not
chairmen to to drive over a bridge.

1376
01:21:07,930 --> 01:21:12,240
Fuck you back and forth. Bridget was
paid for a long ass time ago too.

1377
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:15,870
Yeah that's, that's pretty nuts bin
and then dammit. But I will say this,

1378
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:20,550
my favorite part of the country is like
people wise is definitely the Midwest.

1379
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,360
I love people in Wisconsin,
Minnesota,

1380
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:29,490
Ohio and I love those people. They're
really authentic. They're nice people.

1381
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:30,480
The salt of the earth.

1382
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:33,690
And I think that's also because they
don't have to deal with show business.

1383
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,160
They don't have to deal
with show business.

1384
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:39,000
They have less stress cause there's not
as much traffic and they have character

1385
01:21:39,001 --> 01:21:43,090
because they have to deal with fucking
country weather all the time. Yeah.

1386
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:47,610
Is something about being
happy and you know,

1387
01:21:47,850 --> 01:21:51,390
dealing with a little bit of struggle.
I don't think you can get there.

1388
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:55,080
Like I think growing up in California
is like winning the lottery.

1389
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:59,910
I think what you're dealing with is like
an earned respect for the weather here.

1390
01:21:59,911 --> 01:22:02,760
Because you're from Cincinnati
and you live in Florida.

1391
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,460
You lived in a bunch of
places where it sucks. Right?

1392
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:07,650
And then you come here and you're
like, oh wait a minute. Did you do,

1393
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,720
what are you talking about?
This place is perfect,

1394
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:13,290
but one of the reasons why
you're interesting is because
you didn't grow up here.

1395
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,490
Oh, right, right, right. Yeah.

1396
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:19,910
So it's great to come here once you're a
developed human. I agree. I agree. And I,

1397
01:22:19,911 --> 01:22:23,670
I do think the other thing too about,
the reason I get defensive about like,

1398
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:24,630
you know,
California,

1399
01:22:24,631 --> 01:22:29,430
southern California is the amount of
people who go out of their way to tell you

1400
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,760
that they like, we weren't even talking
about that dude. You know what I mean?

1401
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:36,980
Like, oh, could I ask you? And
they're like, yeah, you know,

1402
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,090
they think it's all the cadet
cardiacs yeah, I know. It's just fun.

1403
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,580
That was all city is keeping up
with the Kardashians. Please.

1404
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,440
There's a lot of people here, man. A
lot of good people though. Giant number.

1405
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,170
You know, when you think about
20 million plus Mexicans,

1406
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,840
what does that really boil out to do?

1407
01:22:54,850 --> 01:22:57,600
They didn't even have any idea
how many illegal aliens are here.

1408
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,890
I don't think we have a real idea. I mean,
how could they? They're illegal aliens.

1409
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,310
Yeah. It's like trying to like figure
out how many deer or in a patch of land.

1410
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:10,450
Our state has about 40 million people.
20 million. That's pretty crazy.

1411
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,800
And how many of those people do you
think are illegal? Mexicans? Um,

1412
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:19,750
probably, um, around
15. So you don't have,

1413
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:23,110
fuck, that is man, that those
people can never go to college,

1414
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:27,730
can never get a driver's license,
can never vote, can never,

1415
01:23:27,731 --> 01:23:31,540
but they live here with their basically
American or pretend they're not American

1416
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:35,020
and like you're not really American.
No, no, no. You didn't do it right.

1417
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:38,080
He didn't do it the way we say you got
to do it, but they've been here for 20,

1418
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:42,040
30 years, but don't, they can't actually
go and get a driver's license. Right.

1419
01:23:42,041 --> 01:23:43,900
Can you just go in and
get that without even,

1420
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,770
I don't think you can for
paperwork. I think, uh, the
terminator stopped that Shit.

1421
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,820
Really? They were going to do that.
But uh, I think he stepped in.

1422
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,360
That'll be the next California,

1423
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:55,000
even though it's already
part of the conversation.

1424
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:59,770
That'll be the next huge thing is going
to be immigration reform. Well, you know,

1425
01:23:59,771 --> 01:24:03,310
you're not going to stop people from
driving by not by telling them they can't

1426
01:24:03,311 --> 01:24:06,010
have a driver's license. You're just going
to create a bunch of illegal drivers.

1427
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,950
They're grown adults. If they have
a job and they save up some money,

1428
01:24:08,951 --> 01:24:10,450
they get a car by hook or by Crook,

1429
01:24:10,451 --> 01:24:12,940
they figured out how to get it on the
road and then they drive around because

1430
01:24:12,941 --> 01:24:15,370
this is what they've got to do and when
you arrest them and you take the car

1431
01:24:15,371 --> 01:24:16,870
away,
you're just stealing from them.

1432
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:20,950
What you really should do is figure out
a way to make them be a paying part of

1433
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:23,440
the culture. Right? The other
problem is they'll, the,

1434
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,560
the big thing that people don't talk
about with illegal aliens is they're not

1435
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:31,060
paying taxes. Because if you're getting
paid in cash and you think about that,

1436
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:34,450
what are the odds that people that are
getting paid in cash or paying the proper

1437
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:36,510
amount, oh, please. You know, he,

1438
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:40,180
he catch some guy and he's a a day worker,
right?

1439
01:24:40,181 --> 01:24:42,710
He's working on construction sites
and they're paying them cash. Yeah.

1440
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:47,770
That guy's not going to report any in that
endeavor. And you know, you say, well,

1441
01:24:47,771 --> 01:24:49,200
Hey,
he shouldn't have to pay taxes.

1442
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:52,210
He doesn't make much money in the first
place. Oh well, if that's our attitude,

1443
01:24:52,211 --> 01:24:54,400
then we better go to those fucking people
working at Mcdonald's cause they're

1444
01:24:54,401 --> 01:24:56,950
getting robbed.
Someone's taken from their paycheck.

1445
01:24:57,190 --> 01:24:59,350
They have to give to solve security.
Everybody does. Now there's,

1446
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:03,700
there's bill yet many billions unaccounted
for a count of four. That would be,

1447
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:08,910
and I'm not saying that it shouldn't be
at least difficult to become a citizen.

1448
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,520
I think you should speak a little bit
of English, at least a little bit.

1449
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:16,600
Make an effort. You should have no
violent criminal history, you know,

1450
01:25:16,601 --> 01:25:18,730
and whatever other crimes you've done,

1451
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,360
it should be really decided whether or
not we want to include you in our culture.

1452
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:25,030
And if they're not included their culture,
we get rid of them.

1453
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:28,510
This weird thing we do well, we just
sort of tolerate them. You know,

1454
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,650
we should let him be Americans that every
American has. God Damn immigrant. Yeah.

1455
01:25:32,890 --> 01:25:37,120
Every one of them. Oh, I know. I mean the
balls to be like, well that's what we are.

1456
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:40,540
We're a nation of immigrants. That's the
whole country. This is ridiculous. Yeah,

1457
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,280
it's, it's really taking advantage
of the fact that these poor people,

1458
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,000
you know, they're going to be here
whether we like it or not. So let's just,

1459
01:25:49,001 --> 01:25:50,860
you know, you got to find a
way to make it work. I mean,

1460
01:25:50,861 --> 01:25:52,300
the worst part of that whole thing is,

1461
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,170
is when you have people
who came here illegally,

1462
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,750
had kids here who are
now an American citizen,

1463
01:25:58,751 --> 01:26:02,150
and we're going to ship the
parents out. I mean, that's crazy.

1464
01:26:02,151 --> 01:26:03,980
I didn't like doing that to your kids.
Like how

1465
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,590
awful. It's awful. And
for the longest time,

1466
01:26:06,591 --> 01:26:09,440
the kids weren't able to go to college.
The kids,

1467
01:26:09,441 --> 01:26:10,820
if they were born in another country,

1468
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:13,700
like if a kid was a baby
in another country and the
mother said, you know what?

1469
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:17,300
I need to raise my son in America.
This is too dangerous where I live.

1470
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:18,230
I'm going to take a chance.

1471
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:23,470
I'm going to get in a fucking a cargo
car and hide and make it to California.

1472
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:28,400
And they do it. They get through all that.
Their kid grows up in America, the kit,

1473
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:31,970
and then they can't kid
can't go to college because
he's illegal. Now they can.

1474
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,350
But for the longest time,

1475
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:37,070
that was the dilemma of the children
of illegal immigrants who were born in

1476
01:26:37,071 --> 01:26:40,100
another country that were smuggled
over here for their own future,

1477
01:26:40,101 --> 01:26:41,030
for their own safety.

1478
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:43,670
And people that are concerned
enough about their kid's future,

1479
01:26:43,671 --> 01:26:46,730
they're willing to risk their own
life to bring them to another country.

1480
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:47,510
I mean it's,

1481
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:52,510
it's a huge commitment and it's a
political pawn is what it becomes.

1482
01:26:52,611 --> 01:26:54,920
It becomes his political pond
where people are looking at it.

1483
01:26:54,921 --> 01:26:59,480
And if you're on the right, then you
support tough immigration and you know,

1484
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:03,110
strengthen our borders and stop the
flow of illegal immigration into this

1485
01:27:03,111 --> 01:27:06,200
country.
And if you're soft and you're,

1486
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:10,640
you're one of those a bleeding
heart liberals, then you decide,

1487
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:14,640
well listen, we need to take care of these
people. We need to set up, you know, and,

1488
01:27:14,641 --> 01:27:16,250
and make it so that they can have

1489
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,070
access to all the things that we pay for.
Because there are unfortunate.

1490
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:23,900
Somewhere in the middle lies the truth.

1491
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:28,370
And I think the idea that these
people just are here and then we just,

1492
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,920
they're illegal immigrants and we
don't address the issue at all.

1493
01:27:30,921 --> 01:27:33,380
They just sort of stay here.
That's what we do in California.

1494
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,080
There was a there wasn't
there a movie about that?

1495
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:38,240
Like the day the Mexicans left la?

1496
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,780
It's like a comedy where
everything's shut down. Yep.

1497
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,230
Well you can better believe that
if you're talking about our city,

1498
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:51,690
if like if you kicked out like
hypothetically every illegal person,

1499
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:54,990
this shit would not function.
Shut down. Completely shut down.

1500
01:27:54,991 --> 01:27:58,230
So what the fuck kind
of game are we playing?

1501
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:03,420
Pretend in this thing that they're not a
part of us. Oh, it's crazy. They totally,

1502
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:04,740
whatever your position is there.

1503
01:28:04,741 --> 01:28:09,741
One undeniable truth is that the economy
functions a huge part of it because we

1504
01:28:10,621 --> 01:28:13,920
have illegal immigrants working in it
and that goes not just for southern

1505
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:16,780
California. That's across the
board. Across the board. I mean,

1506
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:20,010
and other countries or in other cities
in the country it's probably less

1507
01:28:20,011 --> 01:28:23,910
significant, but here it's
fucking gigantic. It's a lot.

1508
01:28:24,030 --> 01:28:28,800
It's a whole lot. The idea that we
just let that stay that way and just,

1509
01:28:28,801 --> 01:28:30,990
Eh, it's a mess. It's complicated.

1510
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,740
It's a political issue because you can't
say that you want to do immigration

1511
01:28:34,741 --> 01:28:37,200
reform because you're going to
lose the vote of the Latinos,

1512
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,880
the Latinos that are here illegally.

1513
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,290
The last thing that they're going to
want is you to say that you're going to

1514
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:44,250
make it tougher, so you're
going to lose that vote. Yeah.

1515
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:48,720
So you have to decide by vote. But if you
say that you're going to, uh, you know,

1516
01:28:48,721 --> 01:28:51,530
you say that you're going to let
them in and they're gonna, you know,

1517
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,960
make it easier, then you're gonna lose
the vote of the hardcore. Right. Right.

1518
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,090
You're going to lose a
lot of the corporations,

1519
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:01,050
which are probably benefiting
on using immigration labor,

1520
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:02,220
and it's certainly

1521
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:03,030
better flavor.

1522
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:06,300
Certainly benefiting on the shit like
they did with the WTO and they started

1523
01:29:06,301 --> 01:29:07,830
moving factories down in Mexico.

1524
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:11,730
There's a lot of God damn corporations
that benefited from that. Yeah.

1525
01:29:11,731 --> 01:29:14,580
It's so funny,
like how you know that you can always,

1526
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:19,410
the corporations support whatever makes
them. Of course, I don't give a fuck.

1527
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:21,150
They're not real.
You know,

1528
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:24,870
there are a construct and a construct
designed to create more numbers. Yeah.

1529
01:29:24,871 --> 01:29:25,760
It's all they are.
They,

1530
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:28,890
the fact that there's people
running it is inconsequential.

1531
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:31,770
It's essentially a machine unto itself.
So moneymaking machine.

1532
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:37,020
Literal moneymaking machine.
Yeah. Like, um, this is not
labor related, but like, um,

1533
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:41,220
what Carl Icahn's trying to do now to
apple? What's he trying to do? Well,

1534
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:43,860
he's a big shareholder and you know,
he's,

1535
01:29:43,861 --> 01:29:48,861
he's a famous corporate raider and so
he's trying to get apple to do a massive

1536
01:29:49,711 --> 01:29:54,711
buyback because they're sitting on
a board of cash over a $145 billion.

1537
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,100
That's amazing.
Hash,

1538
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:04,520
not like v perceived value
of a share cash money.

1539
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:04,891
Yeah.

1540
01:30:04,891 --> 01:30:08,760
They're like bigger than most countries
is a bigger than big investment bank

1541
01:30:08,761 --> 01:30:10,800
firms. Well, they're bigger
than the United States really?

1542
01:30:10,801 --> 01:30:13,190
Because the United States is in
debt. Yeah. There's, are there,

1543
01:30:13,191 --> 01:30:16,440
they're just were trillions of
dollars in desks. Best money making.

1544
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:19,170
I mean it's a lot of cash and he's
like you guys trying to do what?

1545
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,020
He's trying to get them to
buy back shares of Apple.

1546
01:30:22,021 --> 01:30:24,300
So if you own a lot of you own stock,

1547
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:29,630
basically apple would have to use some
of that cash to benefit the investor.

1548
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:35,220
The guy that owns stock in apple will now
make money because they're buying back.

1549
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,550
So they would buy back
their shares in return.

1550
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,640
They would be the bit the share
price would go through the roof.

1551
01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:43,550
So it'd be like if you own stock,
you're,

1552
01:30:43,551 --> 01:30:47,820
you're going to be increased in value
and they would be a private company then.

1553
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:50,700
Well they wouldn't buy back all
of it. Yeah, just a some of it.

1554
01:30:50,701 --> 01:30:55,530
And he wants them basically, you know,
do something for the investor. Yeah.

1555
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,150
Do something with all that
cash and saw that cat.

1556
01:30:57,151 --> 01:31:01,140
But see apple doesn't want
to bring that cash back.

1557
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:06,170
It sits overseas so that they don't have
to pay these crazy high corporate tax

1558
01:31:07,231 --> 01:31:11,610
rates are already apple. They have so much
money though. Dirty, dirty, dirty apple.

1559
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,850
Get that money back into circle.
Having conversations with them.

1560
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:16,950
But if they are unwilling,

1561
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:22,190
then Mr I can will bring something to the
board and the shareholders meeting and

1562
01:31:22,591 --> 01:31:27,591
people will vote on whether or not
to to go through with this buyback.

1563
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:32,190
Wow. I never thought I'd be on the side of
a corporate raider. Yeah, I know. Right.

1564
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:35,400
And He's worth, by the
way, $20 billion himself.

1565
01:31:35,610 --> 01:31:39,240
He's probably wants the biggest
yacht ever. It's just like, damn,

1566
01:31:39,241 --> 01:31:42,420
if I just make this happen, then I'll
get the biggest yacht ever. Yeah.

1567
01:31:42,421 --> 01:31:46,830
I mean he's, he's just, he just, I
think he's in it. He just loves this.

1568
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:51,180
He loves it. It's not about I
need, you know, more money. Yeah.

1569
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:54,270
People who say that there's no, I don't
need money. I don't need much money.

1570
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,790
I agree with you.
It's,

1571
01:31:55,800 --> 01:32:00,160
you're better having a happy life
doing what you want to do then having

1572
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:02,090
tons of money and being unhappy.
Yeah.

1573
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:07,480
There's something to be said for
being a guy who was $20 billion.

1574
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:12,340
Cause I know, me personally,
if I had $20 billion,

1575
01:32:12,490 --> 01:32:15,850
I could make a lot of shit
happen. Okay. I could,

1576
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:20,230
I could make a lot of shit happened.
I think I would,

1577
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:25,560
I would start restructuring society. If I
had 20 billion fucking dollars, I would,

1578
01:32:25,561 --> 01:32:28,170
I would make some moves.
You could, you could,

1579
01:32:28,210 --> 01:32:31,070
you almost have a
responsibility you do to do. So.

1580
01:32:31,150 --> 01:32:33,550
The idea that you couldn't
do good with $20 billion,

1581
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:36,610
you know what kind of community centers
you could set up with $20 billion.

1582
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:40,240
You know what kind of educational
foundation's research foundations,

1583
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:42,790
how much money you could
give to applied sciences,

1584
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:46,150
and how much money you can give to
the right politicians. $20 billion.

1585
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:50,080
That's kind of the principle behind that
giving pledge is they're like, you have,

1586
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:55,320
you have world changing
money, so why don't you, you
know, do something, but you,

1587
01:32:55,340 --> 01:32:59,100
you got your houses and yachts and planes
like, you know, let's make some changes.

1588
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:00,970
The amount of money those guys have.

1589
01:33:00,971 --> 01:33:03,930
When you really stop and think of this
big corporate raider type characters,

1590
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,630
you know those houses. You ever see
those houses in the Hamptons? Yeah.

1591
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,270
We fly over and they look
like castle and you just go,

1592
01:33:10,271 --> 01:33:11,740
I didn't even know this existed.

1593
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:17,040
These 30 acre compounds with
these 50,000 square feet homes.

1594
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:20,050
And you're looking at
it like what is that?

1595
01:33:20,051 --> 01:33:23,350
I mean the staff running
that home is its own economy.

1596
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:26,920
Well Evander Holyfield how to
house in Atlanta. I remember that.

1597
01:33:26,921 --> 01:33:31,921
And it was like 110 rooms and it costs
more than a million dollars a year to

1598
01:33:32,171 --> 01:33:36,310
run, to run a million. It's a lot.

1599
01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:39,390
A million Tommy buns.
That means he's,

1600
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,050
he's paying $100,000 a month in his home.

1601
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:47,980
Just take none of his house. Yeah. Wow.

1602
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:49,810
And that has house fucked him.

1603
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,050
He had to unload that house or
you don't even think he did?

1604
01:33:53,051 --> 01:33:55,020
I think they took it from,
I'll get from him. Oh,

1605
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,280
who the fuck's gonna buy that
thing? Did you see, by the way,

1606
01:33:57,281 --> 01:34:02,170
when we were talking we were having
dinner. Go to a man that's Tyson's house.

1607
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:06,910
Tyson's house was dog shit
compared to have vendors is crazy.

1608
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:09,520
So Tyson's house that they,
he abandoned in Ohio. It was,

1609
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:11,740
I don't know why he bought a
house in Ohio either, by the way.

1610
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:15,840
Is He from Ohio? Yeah, no, Mike
Tyson grew up in Brownsville.

1611
01:34:15,870 --> 01:34:18,660
There was born in Canton or Akron or
something? No, no, no. He was born,

1612
01:34:18,661 --> 01:34:23,520
he was born in Brooklyn. Okay. Well let's
find out. Yeah, he's in New York. I've,

1613
01:34:23,730 --> 01:34:27,120
well I know he lived there.
I think it's book Brooklyn born.

1614
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:33,020
And then you know the training with the
customers up in was in a at some point

1615
01:34:33,631 --> 01:34:38,410
maybe. Right? Cause there's Catskills
and then maybe later there. Yeah,

1616
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:42,120
I'm pretty sure he was born in
New York. Uh, it doesn't say here,

1617
01:34:42,121 --> 01:34:45,750
it just says he's a 47. It doesn't
say his place of birth. Wow.

1618
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:50,970
Looking in his a Wiki.
Can't find it yet.

1619
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:56,470
Born in Brooklyn. Yeah. How
dare you Jamie. Goddammit.

1620
01:34:56,490 --> 01:34:57,940
JV disinformation doing

1621
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,160
buy our house in Ohio though.
Cause he will,

1622
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:03,590
just because someone buys a house in Ohio,
it doesn't mean they're from Ohio.

1623
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:06,950
There's a lot of B. You're downgrading
Ohio son and you're from Ohio.

1624
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,430
So how dare you. He's, he's just
real enough that buckeyes lost.

1625
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:14,390
Is that what it is? He's a
little poor bastard. It's a
little butt hurt over that.

1626
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:17,330
You guys party sports.
You guys are talking shit.

1627
01:35:17,331 --> 01:35:21,800
I don't know nothing about in and
out. We're done with it. The um, uh,

1628
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:25,940
vendor Holyfield house, pull that shit
up if he can because it's quite stunning.

1629
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:27,830
The grounds just the ground.

1630
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:31,940
So it was like a giant golf course when
we were talking about like how crazy,

1631
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:34,020
you know, may whether lives, I was like,

1632
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:37,000
fuck packy I was the
one who's going to come.

1633
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,740
You see how he was having money
problems. Oh, well they took his money.

1634
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:43,640
The government shut all his money off
cause he owes crazy amounts of money.

1635
01:35:43,641 --> 01:35:46,640
Right? Allegedly, this is what he says.

1636
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:50,210
He paid taxes in America on his winnings.

1637
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:54,020
They want him to pay taxes again for the
Philippines. Oh my God. And he's like,

1638
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:57,980
look, I already paid. And they're
saying he owes $50 million. Oh my God.

1639
01:35:58,010 --> 01:35:59,840
So they took all his money.
They just took it all.

1640
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:04,910
So like he wanted to help the tsunami
victims or the typhoon Holyfield's house.

1641
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:08,930
Oh my God. And they, uh, they closest
bank accounts. Look at Holyfield's house.

1642
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:12,200
My God,
when you see this house,

1643
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:16,190
just go back to the outside photo again.
Look at the fucking size of that.

1644
01:36:16,191 --> 01:36:17,720
That's so crazy.

1645
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:21,550
Can you pull back and see like
in perspective with the ground,

1646
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:23,150
see if they have one
that shows the grounds.

1647
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:26,690
It looks like the 409 rooms built Morris.
Oh my God.

1648
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:30,200
Fucking aerial view.
Yeah.

1649
01:36:30,620 --> 01:36:34,790
Isn't it amazing that within a couple
of decades all that money has gone?

1650
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:40,250
Like that guy was making so much money
when he beat like when he beat Riddick

1651
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,050
Bowe and back when he was
the heavyweight champion,

1652
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:46,400
he beat Mike Tyson 30 $40 million paydays,
right? Like I think, I don't know,

1653
01:36:46,401 --> 01:36:48,590
I would assume that he was like make,

1654
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:51,980
I don't think anybody made the kind of
money that Floyd Mayweather it's making

1655
01:36:51,981 --> 01:36:55,610
now for weight may, whether it's making
like a hundred million dollars a fight,

1656
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:58,820
like he might make $100 million
for the Canelo Alvarez fight.

1657
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:03,200
It's because he's also a promoter and he,
and nobody sells paper views.

1658
01:37:03,201 --> 01:37:08,030
Like that fucking guy. He's
a wizard. Yeah, he is. He's
selling it for 7 million.

1659
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:10,343
What?

1660
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:16,130
109 rooms? Is that what it says? It
says he's sold it for 7 million square.

1661
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:19,670
Pull back on that.
That is fucking insane.

1662
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:23,240
Cost more than 1 million annually to
maintain. What are you selling it for?

1663
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:27,920
7 million. He sold it for
11.5 billion. Uh Oh my God.

1664
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:32,660
$230 million child support cases
in Georgia, Texas and California.

1665
01:37:34,580 --> 01:37:39,240
He's double digit. Yeah. I
like shooting loads and girls.

1666
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:43,310
It's fun. It's fun. It feels good.
It's best thing. Best thing ever.

1667
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:47,000
He just didn't give a fuck, I guess.
Yes. Not Man, but that's crazy.

1668
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:50,420
What's your out support payments?
Eight APP is $230 million.

1669
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:52,443
Yeah.

1670
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:56,370
You know, you, you, you,
you know, you hear stories,

1671
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:57,000
you know,

1672
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I know a girl who's sister tried to get
a guy pregnant by taking the condom out

1673
01:38:02,911 --> 01:38:07,140
of the trash and less and squirting
it into our body. Really? Yeah.

1674
01:38:07,141 --> 01:38:09,400
It was like a basketball player or
something like that. Yeah, that's,

1675
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:13,410
that's like a big thing in NBA circles.
Cause like it hosts show up.

1676
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:18,420
I know a guy who works for a team
and he's like, he's like the, the,

1677
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:22,460
like the whole patrol.
Like they show up and they know,

1678
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:26,430
always know the hotels and they, they
make themselves available. These guys,

1679
01:38:26,431 --> 01:38:29,970
you know, like they are, they're
wanting to get pregnant, I'm sure. Yeah.

1680
01:38:29,971 --> 01:38:33,230
So they really have to, you have
to really, what are you get it man.

1681
01:38:33,231 --> 01:38:37,050
And then they just, they know the process.
They like, they have the, they have like,

1682
01:38:37,051 --> 01:38:42,051
they're already set up with the
lawyer for when they get pregnant too.

1683
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:46,980
How to the file for a child support.
Like it's already ready to go.

1684
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:52,440
That's just the, the, the goal is
pregnancy. Well, it's like those, uh,

1685
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:56,690
those accident attorneys at UC, like
late night. Have you been injured? Right.

1686
01:38:56,850 --> 01:39:01,140
Do you need medical assistance? Did you
take comm? Are you in pain? Yeah. Yeah.

1687
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:05,520
Did you take on, did you get pregnant by
a basketball player? We have a solution,

1688
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:06,331
so they probably just have like,

1689
01:39:06,331 --> 01:39:11,331
would you like to make 25 35 $45,000 a
month just for letting your pussy gang

1690
01:39:11,491 --> 01:39:16,110
meeting called me. Yeah. That's
amazing that people would do that,

1691
01:39:16,111 --> 01:39:19,110
that they would actually bring a
life into the world just for profit,

1692
01:39:19,111 --> 01:39:21,330
just for profit. Absolutely.
But when you think about it,

1693
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:23,600
if you've got no money and
then all of a sudden the,

1694
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:27,660
the possibility of making $35,000 in
Monticello and having a kid that you love

1695
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,640
so much money to somebody who's
not making money. Yeah. Oh my God.

1696
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,510
And it'll give you a status.
You know,

1697
01:39:33,511 --> 01:39:37,470
if you carry it around like some
famous guy, Allen Iverson's kid,

1698
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:40,410
sure you get status,
but I got some bad news for you.

1699
01:39:40,411 --> 01:39:45,140
If you had Allen Iverson's kid
might not get that checked as well.

1700
01:39:45,150 --> 01:39:46,500
He was another one. Right? How much money,

1701
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:49,110
that guy making his career
over 200 million. It's gone.

1702
01:39:49,860 --> 01:39:52,770
It's funny that we were talking about
Lotto winners and how they fucking fall

1703
01:39:52,771 --> 01:39:56,850
apart. These guys got earned their money
from their skill and it's all gone to,

1704
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,510
it's to like a hundred million,
$200 million did.

1705
01:40:00,511 --> 01:40:05,220
He made crazy money playing and he had,
he had significant endorsements. I mean,

1706
01:40:05,221 --> 01:40:09,180
that was a guy making 20
and 25 million a year,

1707
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:12,780
year after year after year. This, this
hurts my feelings. Yeah. It's really,

1708
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:15,750
it's really upset. It really does. It
hurts my feelings. I can't understand it.

1709
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,860
I don't understand that. My
why, why wouldn't you take like

1710
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:26,310
10 million? Put it somewhere. Just 10.
You just, you wish, man, you wish you had,

1711
01:40:26,311 --> 01:40:27,660
I'm sure. I mean, I'm
sure that would make,

1712
01:40:27,690 --> 01:40:30,600
that would be so much money to
him right now. You gotta go,

1713
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:34,290
I got that 10 standard. Yeah.
Just live in a nice neighborhood.

1714
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:38,750
Buy a decent house for half a million
or whatever. It just live normal lives.

1715
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:43,620
Normal. Abnormal I think
was, it's so much and like,

1716
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:46,680
you know, like especially like in
basketball where your money's guaranteed.

1717
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:50,940
You made like 20 million this year and
you spent crazy and they're like, dude,

1718
01:40:50,941 --> 01:40:54,140
you got another hundred 30
coming. You, do you remember Iran?

1719
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:59,050
Barkley who? Iran Barkley. I ran
Barkley was a world champion.

1720
01:40:59,051 --> 01:41:03,220
Boxer beat Tommy Hearns, uh,
fought. Roberto Duran fought,

1721
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:07,480
fought some of the greats. Uh, it was
homeless, made millions, millions dogs.

1722
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,670
And one of the things that he said,
it was the,

1723
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:11,290
there was a problem with
him when he was younger.

1724
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:13,450
It was a keeping up with all his friends,

1725
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:17,260
like you became friends with all these
rich athletes and they would all like,

1726
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:20,380
you know, I, Hey, I got this new
bands, Hey I got this new house. Hey,

1727
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:22,180
I got the end that he would try
to keep up with them, you know?

1728
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:24,500
Yeah.
They focus on that on the key,

1729
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:29,530
the competitive part of athletes with
money on that documentary broke that Billy

1730
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,290
Corbin made.
What is that

1731
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,360
documentary?
Cause Billy Corbin is fucking awesome.

1732
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:37,000
He's awesome guy that did
cocaine cowboys. Yeah. Yeah.

1733
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:41,930
So he's done two documentaries
for ESPN 30 for 30 series.

1734
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:43,221
One was about,

1735
01:41:43,221 --> 01:41:47,360
is called the you and it's about
University of Miami's football program and

1736
01:41:47,361 --> 01:41:52,250
dominance and how they basically came
from nothing to just crazy heights of just

1737
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:55,910
five, you know, uh, BCA or
five national championships.

1738
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:00,560
And then the other one he made
was called broke. And it just,

1739
01:42:00,620 --> 01:42:04,070
it's about athletes who
have basically spent it all.

1740
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:07,700
But one of the parts of that when they're
talking about sort of the psychology

1741
01:42:07,701 --> 01:42:12,620
of how you end up going broke is
the guys were saying, you know,

1742
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:13,640
I show up,

1743
01:42:14,690 --> 01:42:19,630
you show up at the practice
facility and like Joe's got, um,

1744
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:24,470
you know, a Ferrari f four 30 and
you're like, God damn, he's like,

1745
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:29,150
check this shit out man. And then you're
like, that's nice. Fuck, I got a top Joe,

1746
01:42:29,390 --> 01:42:33,290
I'm a go get a Lambo Aventador tomorrow
and show up what's up man, check out,

1747
01:42:33,291 --> 01:42:37,040
matched it. And then you each just spent
400 grand that week, you know, like,

1748
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,840
so if you're always doing that,
you know,

1749
01:42:38,841 --> 01:42:41,450
and then you show up with a new
chain and like that's a nice chain.

1750
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,640
I got to show up with some hot shit too.

1751
01:42:43,641 --> 01:42:48,641
Like it's the same thing about us shooting
pool and racing on the track and you

1752
01:42:49,281 --> 01:42:50,810
know,
hitting the bench press,

1753
01:42:50,811 --> 01:42:53,570
that competitive thing that goes
into then the money spending.

1754
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:58,910
So you're always in it. And
if you're talking about,
you know, team 50 teammates,

1755
01:42:58,911 --> 01:43:01,100
you know, you're, you're just
competing, you're always competing.

1756
01:43:01,340 --> 01:43:05,590
Everybody's just buying bigger. And
crazier ship and no one telling you this

1757
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:06,690
really bad idea.

1758
01:43:06,700 --> 01:43:10,440
Taking care of families to Bernie
Kosar took care of 50 families,

1759
01:43:10,680 --> 01:43:15,200
50 families responsible
for financially 50 50. Why?

1760
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:17,140
Why, why? Why was he responsible?

1761
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:19,960
He felt third response to be
like, this says in the, and the,

1762
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,470
this article is about
it. It says that, uh,

1763
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:26,000
they called it the hitting to get a
lottery and they felt a responsibility to

1764
01:43:26,001 --> 01:43:29,000
take care of their friends and family
like all her eyes and was taking care of

1765
01:43:29,001 --> 01:43:33,790
40 people. Oh my God. Pretty Costar. Say
Travis Henry families. He's the, he's the,

1766
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:33,880
yeah.

1767
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:34,713
All time.

1768
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:39,760
Travis Henry is the all time great as
far as fucking making kids with a lot of

1769
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:41,360
people and then having,
what

1770
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:46,290
can you, it says, this is nine kids
with nine moms for 17,000 per month.

1771
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,270
Look at this, but hold on a
second. Look at this part.

1772
01:43:48,390 --> 01:43:50,910
But it's not just known friends and
families that hound these instant.

1773
01:43:51,320 --> 01:43:51,980
It's also young

1774
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,990
ladies with an eye for upward mobility.

1775
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:59,000
One restaurant owner in the nation's
Capitol confessed that she had 7,000 women

1776
01:43:59,001 --> 01:44:03,530
who would receive an automatic text
message every time Michael Jordan walked

1777
01:44:03,531 --> 01:44:06,020
into the joint during
his stretch as a wizard.

1778
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:10,850
Typically over 2000 women would
heed the call. Of course he's rich.

1779
01:44:10,851 --> 01:44:15,560
Young ballers aren't exactly turning leads
the way either. That is unbelievable.

1780
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:20,750
So Jordan would show up at a place in 2000
women would show up to meet him there.

1781
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:24,470
He's having a thousand women would get
the text message. Michael Joe, Oh my God.

1782
01:44:24,471 --> 01:44:27,560
Imagine the pussy that has been thrown
at Michael Jordan. It's not even,

1783
01:44:27,740 --> 01:44:31,070
you can't even wrap your head around. You
know what it's like? It's like locusts

1784
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:35,810
step outside.
Oh yeah.

1785
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,330
He says multiple suits now
for people that are like this.

1786
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:43,680
This is your kid and he's actually
won suits and he keeps winning.

1787
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:47,010
He's winning them because theirs,
that's how you know he's so famous.

1788
01:44:47,011 --> 01:44:49,710
I think there's probably people that did
feel like you did fuck me. He's like,

1789
01:44:49,740 --> 01:44:52,230
I didn't make a kid with you. Well,
this is also probably, I'm sure,

1790
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:55,910
but there's also probably people that are
like hoping that he'll just pay him x.

1791
01:44:56,010 --> 01:45:00,450
Of course she's shut up. Here's some,
here's 300 grand of shut up. Yeah. Yeah.

1792
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:01,920
But you can't just keep doing that.
No.

1793
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:04,170
Especially when you're not
making money anymore. I mean,

1794
01:45:04,171 --> 01:45:07,930
how much those Hanes commercials
pay. Oh, he makes unbelievable money.

1795
01:45:07,931 --> 01:45:12,870
Still doing what? Well, his shoe
brand is the absolute crazy.

1796
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:14,940
Oh, that's his, that's his journey.

1797
01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:18,750
His Nike owns his brand of Air Jordan,

1798
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:23,350
but he is a huge,
huge benefactor of that Bruh.

1799
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:28,380
And he is the number one chew,

1800
01:45:29,310 --> 01:45:32,310
uh, among like that
basketball shoes are a huge,

1801
01:45:32,311 --> 01:45:34,140
huge multibillion dollar business.

1802
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:37,410
His shoes still outsell Lebron and Kolby,

1803
01:45:38,070 --> 01:45:41,610
which is and has been done for
years. That's so crazy. Yeah.

1804
01:45:41,611 --> 01:45:45,460
I would say that Michael Jordan's
still probably makes, um,

1805
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:49,840
probably like $40 million
a year. God, yeah.

1806
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:53,790
He's, he's, as far as business
goes, he has set up, man.

1807
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:58,890
That's unbelievable. Wow. Yeah. I didn't
even think about the sneakers, but it's,

1808
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:01,020
it is incredible when you hear about a guy

1809
01:46:01,110 --> 01:46:05,520
who was so awesome that still to this day,
it's amazing.

1810
01:46:05,521 --> 01:46:08,220
His name rings in the hallowed halls.
They do that.

1811
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:12,830
Oh look, I'm sorry I was off
by 40 million. God. Yeah,

1812
01:46:13,210 --> 01:46:17,750
but how many athletes can say that? None.
None. He's number one. They do that.

1813
01:46:17,751 --> 01:46:22,290
That I think it's like a Q rating where
they rank the impact of just athletes

1814
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:26,010
and the top 10 is like always the
craziest list of guys who you all,

1815
01:46:26,011 --> 01:46:28,010
we all know who they are at Tiger Woods,
right?

1816
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,840
I mean Michael Jordan is number one.

1817
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:35,770
He's been number one for like 25
years and the lowest he ever dipped,

1818
01:46:36,060 --> 01:46:40,950
he went to like number two once under
tiger woods. Probably pissed. Very pissed.

1819
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:44,880
I bet he was. Yeah. Yeah. He apparently,
if you beat him in a game of pool,

1820
01:46:44,881 --> 01:46:48,060
he won't talk to you for two weeks.
I bet. Yeah. They fucking crazy.

1821
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:52,980
He's just completely and competitive
still. They showed him playing at a hotel.

1822
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:58,050
He was playing beer pong with like these
people a few weeks ago and you could

1823
01:46:58,051 --> 01:47:02,350
see him, he's fucking focused on shot
shooting ping pong balls into cups.

1824
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,840
Seems like it would be unfair.

1825
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:07,170
He would know more about the dynamics of
things bouncing in the average person,

1826
01:47:07,950 --> 01:47:10,950
you know, he took that shit
super seriously. He did.

1827
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:13,980
He's going to be one that knowledge and
if you won that he was like fuck that

1828
01:47:13,981 --> 01:47:17,680
round two is up right now.
Double or nothing or nothing.

1829
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,470
Definitely just stacks of money on the
table. He's bringing into two suitcases.

1830
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,700
Yeah. Yeah. Apparently
he's like that with golf.

1831
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:26,880
That's how they say they say in golf.

1832
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:30,090
He is a maniac and he,
he actually,

1833
01:47:30,091 --> 01:47:31,890
there was an article that
was written about him,

1834
01:47:32,430 --> 01:47:33,450
I don't know if it's true or not,

1835
01:47:33,630 --> 01:47:36,760
but some guy who claimed that he owed
millions of dollars or half a million.

1836
01:47:36,761 --> 01:47:39,100
It was a book about it.
There's a book about it and he,

1837
01:47:39,101 --> 01:47:43,080
he was a thing is that he
is a notorious gambler.

1838
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:48,000
He's actually a really good golf golfer.
Like, he has like a real game, you know?

1839
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,500
And he would know wouldn't,

1840
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:53,700
it wasn't uncommon for him to bet a
quarter million on a round of golf.

1841
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:58,770
And he would also, um, they said
like, when he goes to Vegas,

1842
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:03,540
he does, you know, Shit like that for
fun because he makes 80 million a year.

1843
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:07,530
So he's an incredible, what a weird
life that guy has. Yeah. It's amazing.

1844
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:10,790
And he's getting married. He got
married. He got married. Yeah.

1845
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:14,040
Something Young Hottie too.
She's so hot. Ooh. Well Cuban,

1846
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:16,710
I think she's a half Cuban or a Cuban.
Just like fuck it.

1847
01:48:16,711 --> 01:48:19,680
I'll just give her a little piece.
Yeah. Give a little piece of this cash.

1848
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:23,940
You think that's, um, pretty airtight
prenup you'd get when you're married.

1849
01:48:23,941 --> 01:48:25,530
Michael Jordan.
Oh,

1850
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:30,530
I imagine it goes through several
layers of lawyers looking for,

1851
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:33,840
and when your lawyer sends it
back, they're like, listen.
Yeah. Do you like him?

1852
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:37,920
He want this to work. There's no, there's
no other lawyer this just sign it.

1853
01:48:38,070 --> 01:48:42,390
You can't, you don't negotiate.
You get 23 and you for life.

1854
01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:45,540
It's a good deal. Right. And
he's just a maniac gambler.

1855
01:48:45,541 --> 01:48:48,510
Just gone off with an 80 million
a year coming in every year.

1856
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:50,760
And that's why you can't say
shit about what he was gambling.

1857
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:55,770
I lost $1 million gambling today.
10 years plus he's making like a hundred.

1858
01:48:56,250 --> 01:48:58,290
You mean, think about that. It's so crazy.

1859
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:02,190
$100 million a year close to it for 10
years. I mean, how long does it take?

1860
01:49:02,430 --> 01:49:05,390
Does he have a billion? Do you think he
has a billion? I think civilian, yeah.

1861
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:09,120
I mean, if you make an 80 million
a year, and he was famous for,

1862
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:12,450
I don't know if it was him
or his agent at the time,

1863
01:49:12,451 --> 01:49:16,080
but he's famous for being
one of the innovators in the,

1864
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:19,800
when he was getting these
crazy, um, endorsement deals,

1865
01:49:19,950 --> 01:49:23,550
he was getting stock as part of his deal.
So like,

1866
01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:26,880
he would get millions of
dollars to sponsor, you know,

1867
01:49:26,881 --> 01:49:31,140
to be the endorser of Gatorade, but
then insisted on owning stock. Well,

1868
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,050
guess what? When Michael Jordan
started endorsing Gatorade,

1869
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:38,550
stock went up pretty
significantly and he made many,

1870
01:49:38,551 --> 01:49:40,320
many more millions than he would have.

1871
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,930
So he's pretty innovative
in that sense too.

1872
01:49:42,990 --> 01:49:46,470
It's incredible when you hear a guy like
him and then you hear a guy like Tyson

1873
01:49:46,471 --> 01:49:48,010
who's telling story now

1874
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:52,870
on HBO. Yeah. It does it in a Broadway
show of how I lost $300 million.

1875
01:49:52,871 --> 01:49:57,060
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the
difference in the two, it's, it's,

1876
01:49:57,270 --> 01:50:00,910
it's significant. It's not, you
know, another thing is to basketball,

1877
01:50:00,911 --> 01:50:04,030
you're not getting hit in the fucking
head at helps getting hit in the head

1878
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:07,670
definitely increases your amount of
shitty decisions that you make. Yeah.

1879
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,360
Without a doubt. Yeah, no doubt. I mean,

1880
01:50:10,361 --> 01:50:14,230
think about how Shitty your brain
works when you're exhausted. Oh yeah.

1881
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:18,370
Now think about after an exhausting fight
of getting fucking thumped in the head

1882
01:50:18,371 --> 01:50:21,880
for 12 rounds. Now think about doing
that over the course of 20 plus years,

1883
01:50:22,390 --> 01:50:25,060
a lot of cloudy judgment.
This is going to be some shitty decision.

1884
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:30,070
Makes some shitty 109 room houses that
you have built and they're like a Vander.

1885
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:35,980
Um, you know how much this is
going to cost a lot of money. Um,

1886
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:38,800
don't worry about it.
God will provide real deal.

1887
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:42,820
Jesus will provide me with my bounty.
Okay.

1888
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:46,480
He's still fighting Avengers
fighting. Yeah, I believe so. Yeah.

1889
01:50:46,630 --> 01:50:49,540
I think he just tried to a fight
recently and he couldn't get a,

1890
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:52,450
I think it was a,
maybe it was.

1891
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:54,970
Here's what I want to note is
Riddick Bowe still fighting

1892
01:50:56,630 --> 01:50:59,810
cause that wasn't good at a while ago.
Uh,

1893
01:50:59,811 --> 01:51:03,080
he fought recently in a Moitai fight.
Really Sad.

1894
01:51:04,310 --> 01:51:07,820
It was really, really
sad. He got leg kick.

1895
01:51:07,821 --> 01:51:11,330
He got stopped by leg kicks, but
it was just devastating man. Yeah.

1896
01:51:11,331 --> 01:51:16,010
He's 51 years old and uh, he's still
fighting. You're still trying to fight.

1897
01:51:17,300 --> 01:51:18,930
He still looks good actually.
And he's,

1898
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,340
as far as like boxers
go talks pretty good.

1899
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:27,290
Oh my Evander. Yeah. Yeah. Not Bad. Yeah.

1900
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:32,900
Yeah. Well, people are still talking
about him fighting. I mean, who knows.

1901
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:35,433
Wow.

1902
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:38,390
Holly F four hours ago,
this is crazy.

1903
01:51:39,170 --> 01:51:43,790
Four hours ago a Evander Holyfield
mansion fails to sell at auction.

1904
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:48,130
It's failed to sell. Yup. Back on
market. It's back on the market son.

1905
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:52,700
Um,
it was a 6.8 million.

1906
01:51:54,170 --> 01:51:57,620
Wow. It's back on the free market
for 6.8 million. They tried.

1907
01:51:58,530 --> 01:51:59,180
Okay.

1908
01:51:59,180 --> 01:52:04,180
So it was purchased by JP Morgan Chase
last year for 7.5 million after he

1909
01:52:04,821 --> 01:52:09,380
defaulted on its debt. So then they
tried to sell it at mark at a auction.

1910
01:52:09,410 --> 01:52:12,170
Nobody wanted it.
And now it's on sale for 6.8 million.

1911
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:17,180
That is a fucking steel you've gotta be
able to do to make money on that somehow,

1912
01:52:17,181 --> 01:52:20,780
man. No, no, no one cares.
No, I'm saying make money.

1913
01:52:20,960 --> 01:52:25,760
Like if you buy it now, like if you were
to buy that house, I doubt it. Yeah. No,

1914
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:29,300
the the only reason why no one's buying
it is because they can't make money on

1915
01:52:29,301 --> 01:52:31,250
it.
I mean to have a house like that,

1916
01:52:31,251 --> 01:52:34,970
you got to check how's it going to sit
on the market for a long fucking time and

1917
01:52:34,971 --> 01:52:38,000
who's going to buy it? Is it going
to be some new Lebron James Type Guy?

1918
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:40,550
That's the only type of guy that's
going to buy it. Right. And even then,

1919
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:43,190
they're going to look at the
angle of 109 fucking rooms.

1920
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:46,670
Do I need a hundred night? No, I like 2020

1921
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:49,810
yeah, 20 is good. And a basketball
court. Yeah. And then like,

1922
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:51,430
well we can get you that. I'm like, yeah,

1923
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:54,110
let's do you get that and
you get like 89 other rooms.

1924
01:52:54,111 --> 01:52:57,670
Why don't you want this day deal? Got
Staff everywhere. Of course it's cool.

1925
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:00,950
Do you like living in the shining house?
It should be a, it should be like,

1926
01:53:00,951 --> 01:53:04,550
it should, they need to reach out to
like some Middle Eastern, you know,

1927
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:08,630
some baller by type dude who was a boxing
fan, but it's not seem Ahmed's friend.

1928
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:09,583
Just uh,

1929
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:14,480
just maybe one day I'll go to Georgia
cause by that and we'll stay there for a

1930
01:53:14,481 --> 01:53:17,750
paltry 6.8 million, you
know, a guy and a lot man.

1931
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:21,470
One of those salt number NY
type characters. Oh really?
Buy this shit up with the,

1932
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:25,310
the quickness son. Give
me that shit. Did you, uh,

1933
01:53:25,730 --> 01:53:29,270
did you check out my, um, special
bombing episode that I heard? No,

1934
01:53:29,271 --> 01:53:31,880
you told me about it. We were talking
about it before the podcast. We,

1935
01:53:31,881 --> 01:53:34,130
it's funny where all like almost
three hours in we were going to,

1936
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:38,570
we really mentioned it or two hours
in. Um, what the fuck happened?

1937
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:42,740
You were up in Winnipeg?
I A Winnipeg, I was um,

1938
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:46,160
doing this club that I've done many
times called rumors. It's the old club,

1939
01:53:46,161 --> 01:53:51,161
it's a good club and it was a Saturday
night and instead of like regular comedy

1940
01:53:53,991 --> 01:53:54,824
club crowd,

1941
01:53:55,190 --> 01:54:00,190
it happened to be like private event
people like a group of 80 was doing their

1942
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,490
corporate party, you know what
I mean? So it wasn't like,

1943
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:09,500
it wasn't individuals buying one
and two tickets, giant group,

1944
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:13,850
giant groups. So there was like
three groups. One was like 81 was 60.

1945
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,730
So you don't like,
it's more like you're doing a corporate,

1946
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:21,410
like you're doing a private event, you
know, and I talk, I break it down if you,

1947
01:54:21,411 --> 01:54:22,850
if you want to listen to,

1948
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:28,270
it's episode one 72 of your mom's house
and I play the audio from this thing

1949
01:54:30,410 --> 01:54:32,000
falling off the rails.

1950
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,900
And I mean it is like there was
a lady who worked at the club,

1951
01:54:35,901 --> 01:54:38,480
she's been there 20 years and she told me,
she goes,

1952
01:54:38,481 --> 01:54:42,410
I've never seen shit like that. Even close
to that before what happened? It was,

1953
01:54:42,470 --> 01:54:45,170
I mean I think it's like a,

1954
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:49,040
a combination of things happening to them.

1955
01:54:49,041 --> 01:54:53,720
They fall apart that way.
Basically. I went up there,

1956
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:57,980
I had one guy in the
front row who I fucking,

1957
01:54:57,981 --> 01:55:01,520
you know when you just hate somebody
and you fixate on them because like this

1958
01:55:01,521 --> 01:55:06,440
one guy who was like kind of mumbling,
talking, tagging my everything I saw no.

1959
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:09,380
He's like, yeah, I bet you'd
like that. And you're like,
what? What did you just say?

1960
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:10,511
And I said,

1961
01:55:10,511 --> 01:55:15,511
I said one of those guys who I
fucking absolutely lost my shit.

1962
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:20,660
I didn't lose my shit on them,
but I kind of tried to straighten him out.

1963
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:23,420
And then there was one of the groups,

1964
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:28,510
one of the groups of like 50 50 60 people
was like being super loud and like the

1965
01:55:29,151 --> 01:55:31,610
first like really talking about
when I went to talk to them,

1966
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:37,360
they were kind of like just like kind
of shitty about it and the thing is like

1967
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,970
it's different when you,
when you do a regular show and you,

1968
01:55:40,971 --> 01:55:43,220
let's say you go after somebody
or you go after a table,

1969
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,220
you're just working on five people.

1970
01:55:47,221 --> 01:55:49,260
Maybe write a group that like,

1971
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,820
but then everybody else in that room
has nothing to do with them. Right.

1972
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:57,420
In this case it was more like mob
mentality where when I was like, hey,

1973
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:02,280
go fuck yourself. Then the group
is like, you're talking to us.

1974
01:56:02,710 --> 01:56:03,930
Not you're not.
You're not just talking to them.

1975
01:56:03,931 --> 01:56:07,230
You're talking to my group of
80 so then it was like, no,

1976
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:09,330
fuck you like,

1977
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:13,200
but in in unison there's all
of them and then it just went.

1978
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:16,800
Then I tried to put it back on the
rails, which I was like, I'm sure I can,

1979
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:20,250
I've done this a thousand times.
Let me put this back together.

1980
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:24,450
Fuck you man. Like it was like, dude,

1981
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:29,550
they were booing in unison
for like 1520 minutes.

1982
01:56:29,551 --> 01:56:33,280
The 80 people at this point,
it was more than their group.

1983
01:56:33,281 --> 01:56:36,090
So it was probably 200 people doing that.
All my God.

1984
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:38,850
So is their group and then
other groups chimed in. So yeah.

1985
01:56:38,910 --> 01:56:43,290
Boone you two unrelated groups.
Yes. Yes. Whoa. It was pretty crazy.

1986
01:56:44,190 --> 01:56:45,900
And then they're like,
bring back the,

1987
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:48,960
I had a black feature act to
like bring back the Black Guy,

1988
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:53,640
like screaming that screaming it man.
And it went and I, here's the thing,

1989
01:56:53,641 --> 01:56:58,440
I resigned to the fact that it was
so crazy. It was less emotional.

1990
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:03,030
I talk about this on that episode
then your standard bombing,

1991
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:07,320
like when you're bombing and irregular
bond where it's just not going your way

1992
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,300
and you start to sweat and you're like,
man,

1993
01:57:09,301 --> 01:57:13,830
this fucking sucks chewing Dick's up
here. But like, and that and that,

1994
01:57:13,831 --> 01:57:15,210
like emotionally affects you.

1995
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:21,200
This was different in that I felt like
their response to me was so outrageous.

1996
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,610
Like I felt like it was unwarranted.

1997
01:57:26,611 --> 01:57:30,300
How upset they were that it affected me
less. Like I was just standing up there.

1998
01:57:30,301 --> 01:57:31,134
I was like,

1999
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:34,620
all right guys here we ready for some
more jokes as they're booing me, you know,

2000
01:57:34,621 --> 01:57:39,510
like not as, I wasn't as flustered as
I've been during a regular real bomb.

2001
01:57:39,511 --> 01:57:43,710
Yes. So you were just dealing with a giant
group of cons. Yes. A school of cons.

2002
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:47,700
Yes. Swimming through
your pond. Yeah, exactly.

2003
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:50,840
Why didn't the club do something about
that? That's, that's the only part I, I,

2004
01:57:50,841 --> 01:57:55,110
cause I take responsibility, I'm,
I try to make it clear on that,

2005
01:57:55,111 --> 01:58:00,111
on that episode that like I'd take
responsibility for yelling at a guy,

2006
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:02,730
for insulting people.
Like I'm saying,

2007
01:58:02,731 --> 01:58:05,610
I put it on myself that I
made things go downhill.

2008
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:10,970
The club takes responsibility for kind
of not really policing and they like the

2009
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:16,470
one part is I tried to, I told the
guy that he had to go, I was like,

2010
01:58:16,471 --> 01:58:20,850
you have to go, you're gone.
See you later. And you know,

2011
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:24,440
I've done that before. Sometimes you have
to do that. You're Outta here man. Right.

2012
01:58:24,870 --> 01:58:27,720
And then they were like,
the club came into and they're like,

2013
01:58:27,810 --> 01:58:30,420
just give him another chance. He's
going to be good now. When I was like,

2014
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:34,680
I've already thrown them out, like there's
no, we're not negotiating now. Right.

2015
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:39,000
So the club asked to keep the guy there.
Yes. So that part of that, I don't know.

2016
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:42,520
But they, they, now
that that was fucked up,

2017
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:44,860
like I've talked to them and
they were like, that was,

2018
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:48,610
that was some people you can give
a second chance. I've most likely,

2019
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:51,630
most of the time I've asked clubs to
leave people alone like that. Yeah,

2020
01:58:51,730 --> 01:58:55,030
they're okay. They're okay. Yeah.
They're just not do that again.

2021
01:58:55,060 --> 01:58:58,780
And he'll say that. I'm like,
yeah, you can't yell shit
out. Just too, too confusing.

2022
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:01,620
I've done that a bunch of
times. Like he's okay. Right.

2023
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:05,590
But this time the difference was this time
I was saying, get them out of him out.

2024
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:09,910
What was he saying to you? Well, this
is going on. He was, it was the fucking,

2025
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:12,890
he was the Mumbler the
the tower, right? Like,

2026
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:16,810
so we had our first interaction,
we had another interaction.

2027
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:21,610
I think the third time I said
something to him, I was like,

2028
01:59:21,611 --> 01:59:25,660
what the fuck did you say? I
forget exactly what he said.
And then I was like, oh,

2029
01:59:25,661 --> 01:59:28,810
you're a tough guy. And he's like, do
you wanna step outside and find out?

2030
01:59:29,590 --> 01:59:33,340
And I was like, you can go outside
cause you're out of here. You're done.

2031
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:38,560
Get out of my fucking show. It's my show
out of here. And they were like, what?

2032
01:59:38,870 --> 01:59:41,620
And His table. He goes, we all go
and go, great. Have a great night.

2033
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:46,660
Get the fuck Outta here. I don't need you
here. That's when the crowd, the problem,

2034
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:49,390
we felt like we were
discussing what happened.

2035
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:50,680
I was talking about it with the club.

2036
01:59:50,681 --> 01:59:55,681
The guy is that a lot of people in that
room didn't hear what he was saying.

2037
01:59:57,830 --> 02:00:02,080
He thought I was just attacking
a guy for no reason. Right.

2038
02:00:02,740 --> 02:00:06,860
That makes sense. But I still would, I
take, I was an asshole that night. That's,

2039
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:11,110
you know, the guy was clearly,
he was instigating it.
Yeah. He was a fucking cunt.

2040
02:00:11,200 --> 02:00:15,190
He was a real kind of guy and I
didn't like him at all. And you know,

2041
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:19,230
I don't think that like,
like I always say I,

2042
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:24,580
I don't have to be like
pleasing to the different,

2043
02:00:24,581 --> 02:00:29,230
like I, you know, I'm there doing comedy.
You came to see my standup if you want,

2044
02:00:29,231 --> 02:00:34,000
if you're not liking it, that's cool.
But if you try to take over the room, no.

2045
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:37,180
Well it's not just taking over the room.
It's interfering. Yeah. It's interfering,

2046
02:00:37,181 --> 02:00:38,480
interfering with the performance.

2047
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:42,950
And there's hundreds of other people
that have to deal with the fact that you

2048
02:00:42,951 --> 02:00:45,250
have to deal with this guy.
Yeah. Yeah. It just, it's,

2049
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:48,920
it's all in how to do it and not lose
your cool and when you lose your cool.

2050
02:00:48,921 --> 02:00:53,510
Yeah. So it's a fucking, it's bad
scene. Terrible feeling too. It's crazy.

2051
02:00:53,511 --> 02:00:55,440
And the audio is insane,
Zane.

2052
02:00:55,470 --> 02:01:00,300
I mean, you've probably not heard a lot.
I like that. Yeah. It's a different,

2053
02:01:00,301 --> 02:01:02,790
it's not like a standard bombing.
I mean there's,

2054
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,420
there's a lot of aggression from the
crowd on it. And how does it end?

2055
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:10,560
Well the best part and the only,
cause I also was bummed at myself for not,

2056
02:01:10,561 --> 02:01:13,320
I was like, I, you know, you always
look at moments where you're like,

2057
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:16,050
I wish I had said something
funny. You're here. Right.

2058
02:01:16,051 --> 02:01:19,050
This was an opportunity to be
funny. I'm really, you know,

2059
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:22,620
so I was like a lot of it,
I was like, I was like, ah,
you know, I really, they won.

2060
02:01:22,621 --> 02:01:26,370
Like they defeated me. I was like, but
the only funny thing I'd said was like,

2061
02:01:26,371 --> 02:01:31,200
at one point the manager came up to this
stage and he was like, are you okay?

2062
02:01:31,230 --> 02:01:34,560
Like he was checking out. He came on
stage and was like, cause it was so crazy.

2063
02:01:34,561 --> 02:01:37,260
And then he's like, Yo, all right.
I was like, yeah. He's like,

2064
02:01:37,261 --> 02:01:38,430
do you want to keep you
long? I was like, yeah.

2065
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:42,170
He's like,
okay,

2066
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:45,550
leaves. And they're like,
yeah, that's right. Get the,

2067
02:01:45,690 --> 02:01:49,570
cause they think he's telling
me get offstage and I go, I go,

2068
02:01:49,571 --> 02:01:54,370
he asked me if you guys wanted
me to bring back the other guy.

2069
02:01:54,371 --> 02:01:57,640
And they go, yeah, they scream.
Yes. And I go, I told him,

2070
02:01:57,820 --> 02:02:00,970
you guys want more of me so here I
am for more jokes. And they're like,

2071
02:02:03,980 --> 02:02:07,490
so they go so crazy at that point.
These are Canadians too. Yeah,

2072
02:02:07,491 --> 02:02:09,230
they go fuck the nicest people ever.

2073
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:13,770
But in the very end,
the lady who was running the,

2074
02:02:13,860 --> 02:02:16,710
one of the private events that night,
like she brought her group there,

2075
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:22,370
she was in tears, she was crying
and they brought her on stage.

2076
02:02:22,371 --> 02:02:25,140
They were like, she wants to say
something. And I was like, oh,

2077
02:02:25,141 --> 02:02:29,340
because my plan was just stay here
the entire time, no matter what.

2078
02:02:29,341 --> 02:02:34,030
Talk about recipes that you want to
try and just Dohuk these them. Yeah.

2079
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:39,030
She gets up there and she's like, please,
I know I've done fundraisers here.

2080
02:02:39,031 --> 02:02:41,250
Like I really wanted
this to be a good night.

2081
02:02:41,251 --> 02:02:44,850
And I see like how like she's
a right way affected by this.

2082
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:48,900
Please give him the respect of just your,

2083
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:51,810
your time and like just let
him talk and they're like,

2084
02:02:51,811 --> 02:02:55,710
it's too fucking late for that fuck.
Like they're going crazy. Oh right.

2085
02:02:56,030 --> 02:02:58,660
And I see her like just
like she's defeated.

2086
02:02:58,660 --> 02:03:02,250
It was like someone was beating her up,
you know, and I was like, oh my God, I go,

2087
02:03:02,251 --> 02:03:03,084
you know what,

2088
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:08,280
this is 35 minutes in to what's
supposed to be like a 50,

2089
02:03:08,310 --> 02:03:12,300
55 minute set,
so there's 20 minutes to go.

2090
02:03:12,990 --> 02:03:17,580
I was like, you know what? Um, I don't,
I want her to have a fun night. She like,

2091
02:03:17,581 --> 02:03:21,210
she like, it affected me
that she was so, I was like,

2092
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:23,730
I'll tell you what because you're a
nice lady and blah, blah, blah. I go,

2093
02:03:23,731 --> 02:03:26,040
I'll bring back the black guy.

2094
02:03:26,160 --> 02:03:29,400
And so I brought the black guy back
on stage and they went fucking,

2095
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:34,140
it was like I said, ladies and gentlemen
