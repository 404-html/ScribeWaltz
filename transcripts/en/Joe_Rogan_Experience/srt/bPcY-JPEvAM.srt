1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,440
Okay,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,190
yes,
yeah,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,220
yeah.
Natasha,

4
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:12,720
put your phone because
you're trying,

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,290
but the struggle was real.
I wasn't sure it's not coming up.

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,730
There it goes.
This interface.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,980
It's very hard.
It's very hard.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,830
Um,
are you guys worried that by calling

9
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:26,280
your tour endless honeymoon,
you might put the jinx on it?

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,020
Sorta like how rob and black China and
doing a reality show.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,610
A jinx on what our marriage or the tour.
We can pivot.

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,160
We can pivot into the endless divorce
tour very quickly,

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,600
right?
Because you guys will be friends.

14
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:42,840
Even if you miss,
you hit the rocks strictly homeys tour.

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:45,590
Well,
the way we thought of it as we're in

16
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:46,490
Newport,
Rhode Island,

17
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:50,120
we learned about this rich couple who
went on a 10 year honeymoon and then

18
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:54,170
they came back with four kids and I just
thought that sounded so romantic to be

19
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,750
so rich that you dislike.
Went away for a decade.

20
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,260
Yeah.
You have kids on the fly.

21
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,400
You Go away,
newlyweds,

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,220
you come back.
Grandparents.

23
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,710
That's super bowl too.
Like they don't even know their doctor.

24
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:08,010
They're in fucking Sweden.
There are rich people.

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,460
Those people were so richmond.
Do you know about the newport that the

26
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,040
seat of wealth?
That was newport,

27
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:13,940
Rhode Island.
Oh yeah.

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,420
I used to do a lot of gigs in Rhode
Island.

29
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:18,560
There's Caesar's insane mansions.
They're the in the,

30
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,590
well in the gilded age,
1900.

31
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:25,250
Basically 90 percent of the wealth in
America was in Rhode Island and then

32
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,310
everyone else was living in squalor.

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,860
They hadn't established personal income
tax yet.

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,270
It was like the years right before
personal income tax had been established

35
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,010
in this country.

36
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:42,010
So people had like 35 indoor servants,
55 outdoor servants like you could.

37
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,500
People would come from Australia and
boats and you would just make them your.

38
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,810
It was like slavery,
but

39
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,480
the show,
the endless listen to mature.

40
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:54,760
We do an extended lecture on personal
income tax and the history and slavery.

41
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:55,370
Yeah,
no.

42
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:55,650
Nice.

43
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,440
So another period is based on that.
That's how we know about it,

44
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,880
but yeah,
they were like these people.

45
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:03,360
It was the carnegies and the
rockefellers and these like seat of

46
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:04,980
power,
like Illuminati old.

47
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,020
You had a billion dollars a hundred
years ago.

48
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:11,140
Like these people or they were just.
But now we've come full circle and

49
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:14,930
people have figured out how to legally
steal money and not paying income tax.

50
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:18,440
So but not that many.
I mean the other thing,

51
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,950
but don't like the Romney's of the
world.

52
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,500
Don't they know how to not pay or are
you talking about?

53
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,280
Well like the like politicians don't.
They kind of know how to.

54
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,760
You're talking about.
She's talking about big old corporate

55
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:34,260
oligarchy billionaire people figured out
any super rich people are going to try

56
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:38,130
really hard to hold onto their money and
pay as little taxes as possible and form

57
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:40,500
llcs and corporations that don't kind of
jazz.

58
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:43,140
But it is funny.
The comedians are like mostly super

59
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,780
liberal and they were all like,
man,

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,070
we got Bernie and we gotta like pay
these high tax rates and anyway I'm

61
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,850
incorporated on my llc name is.
Sounds like you're doing a corporate

62
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,090
fiction too.
Differ

63
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,440
for entertainers,
but here's the problem.

64
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,130
Like where's the going?
Like I'd

65
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,090
be willing to give away more money and
tax dollars if I knew that it was a rock

66
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,280
solid establishment.
They really knew what to do.

67
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,090
And if you could pick,
if you could tick like little feel,

68
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:09,911
a little bubbles,
like,

69
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,200
oh,
I like most of my money to go to

70
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,430
education.
No,

71
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,080
nothing to.
Nothing to that.

72
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,650
That'd be amazing.
Would be.

73
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,450
But the country be fucked.
Yeah.

74
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,920
The roads to fall apart quicker.
Everything would fall apart.

75
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,690
You know,
cops would be out of business.

76
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,420
Well no,
because half of the country at least

77
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,980
would be like all my money.
The cops,

78
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,040
all my mother did defense.
I would love to see.

79
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,171
I would love to.
I don't,

80
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:34,360
I wouldn't love to do it because I just
don't think that that amount of power

81
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,730
should be in people's hands without a
lot of research first.

82
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,340
You know,
I think that's big part of the problem.

83
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,880
Even running for president and voting
for president,

84
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,750
you don't have to have any research done
before you choose a candidate.

85
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,970
You just like them.
And also you don't have to have done any

86
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,710
research to be the president.

87
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,910
I guess I'm a hillary person.
Yeah.

88
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,910
Yeah.
You can become a hillary person just

89
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:01,480
because you didn't want to reality show
contestant or whatever the fuck you was.

90
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,890
What?
That's the crazy thing about,

91
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:03,880
and I.
I do think,

92
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:05,020
I think we're talking about this last
time.

93
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:09,160
I do think trump,
if he's doing anything good for American

94
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,340
society,
he's pointing out how ridiculous and

95
00:04:12,341 --> 00:04:14,830
arbitrary the worship of the American
president is.

96
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,590
Oh yeah.
That's not presidential.

97
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,970
Presidential means that you look
dignified while you bomb a village in

98
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:24,100
Yemen,
like we should just destroy

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,030
presidential.
As an idea of adult said that he called

100
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,530
it the uniquely American religion of
President Worship President worship.

101
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,640
Yeah.
That is really.

102
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,440
I mean it's really just a new version of
King's.

103
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,800
Oh,
that's so funny that our whole

104
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:42,610
foundation mythology is based on the
rejection of the king and we immediately

105
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:45,690
established king kingship,
which is what they did in.

106
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,220
In Christianity.
I think of Christianity this way,

107
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:51,190
like it's based in this Judaic religion
that says,

108
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,200
let's get rid of the idea of a man that
you worship or a figure or a God that

109
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:58,330
you bow in front of them.
There's one right in front of us,

110
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,430
right?
Let's get rid of a statue that you bow

111
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:03,460
down in front of and the next religion
was like,

112
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,650
oh,
let's watch a human being like,

113
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,840
it's so weird that it's so in us.
Well,

114
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:12,160
it's Alpha male chimpanzee stuff.
We always try to look to the number one

115
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,760
though,
the one that knows the most,

116
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:17,380
the oldest with the most scars.
It's gone to the battle as the most

117
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:21,490
wisdom lead us because you want to know
which snakes are poisonous and what

118
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:23,410
plants you can eat and what's going to
kill you.

119
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,383
Right.
And and,

120
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,840
and everybody worships the past.
That's what's so funny to me about an

121
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,950
American.
It's the day after July fourth and

122
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,930
everybody talks about the founding
fathers is like,

123
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,770
those were dudes who had the education
of it.

124
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,840
There were brilliant people in the 18
hundreds and 17 hundreds,

125
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,260
but I'm not like trying to.
I'm not trying to go to a doctor from

126
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:45,130
the founding fathers days.
Yeah.

127
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,290
People price dunk people probably did
probably stank.

128
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,780
It probably just would let people
smelled like back then,

129
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,330
like if you call it a gal after a bath,
you were psyched.

130
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,910
Bath is that.
Let's be honest about what a bath is.

131
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,920
It's asshole and vagina soup.
You're sitting in a big teapot,

132
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,690
but you don't buy your balls in there.
It's just the vessels in women put their

133
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:13,700
vaginas in.
Men they have.

134
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,650
They hold up their assholes,
their dicks and balls,

135
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,010
so they don't concern me what a guy
smells like,

136
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,410
but what a girl smells like,
concerns me,

137
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,050
but maybe it wouldn't have back then.
Maybe it wouldn't have.

138
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,970
Yeah.
Maybe just your standards change.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,781
I mean,
if you're horny enough,

140
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,860
you don't care.
That is true.

141
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:31,520
I'll never forget this passage
always,

142
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,220
but you're an incredibly horny person
because

143
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,370
my wife.
Let me just say,

144
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,740
guys,
my wife is so horny.

145
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,120
I love that word.
How you did it in a sort of a gay.

146
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,340
Why don't listen to funny that like
being more mobile is gay is gay.

147
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,700
If you just start going like this,
people go as gay as fuck.

148
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,850
There's A.
There's a story about Tom Cruise.

149
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,040
We heard this,
that he came to,

150
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,010
I can't remember who it was,
some comedy person who's like a normal

151
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:01,940
human being,
right?

152
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:05,000
Like,
but famous but not like Tom Cruise

153
00:07:05,001 --> 00:07:05,834
fairness.
Right.

154
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,000
Tom Cruise,
like connected with that person.

155
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,370
I can't make it a better story if I
remember who it was.

156
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:12,870
But if somebody like that,
like your level or or,

157
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,020
or,
or like a mark duplass or.

158
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,510
You know what I'm saying?
Like I don't know who mark says,

159
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,280
well he's the guy at your level.
No,

160
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,310
no,
no.

161
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,810
Is the duplass Jamie knows who everybody
is.

162
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,950
I don't know who the duplass brothers
there.

163
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,230
They made the show togetherness on Hbo.
My point isn't about the duplass

164
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:32,390
brothers is like,
they were just like semi famous.

165
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:37,391
Not like
Tom Cruise cruise got so horny she wants

166
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:39,110
to get to the fire.

167
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,210
So see he got invited to a superbowl
party at this person's house.

168
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,770
Right?
Like imagine if Tom Cruise is coming to

169
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:48,140
your house for the superbowl superbowl
party.

170
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:49,070
He was like,
oh whoa.

171
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,690
Asking Tom Cruise?
And he says,

172
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:53,060
yes honey.
You said yes.

173
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,380
What do we do?
Right.

174
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:57,140
And it might've been Tom cruise be like,
I think I will be among the humans

175
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,810
today.
So Tom,

176
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,890
because it barely shows up with a brand
new,

177
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:04,480
like clearly fresh football that his
assistant like,

178
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,920
you know,
he's like tossing like a literal brand

179
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,490
new football in the air.
Right.

180
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,240
And they're all talking about marriage
at some point in the day and goes,

181
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,250
do you know what the best part of being
married is though?

182
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:15,260
Right?
Fucking your wife,

183
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,840
am I right?
You just fuck your wife.

184
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,980
And everybody's like,
felt like tumbleweeds are all three of

185
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,850
like a robot,
like an alien visiting us.

186
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,130
He must be amazing to hang out with.
I would love to hang out with him.

187
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,780
Fucking your wife.
Right?

188
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,880
I mean when you're that famous,
your work ethic,

189
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:38,050
it's like you just devote everything to
that I think because like I have my,

190
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,470
my agents were like,
they know that the agents who are Tom

191
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,240
Cruise agents,
they said Tom Cruise always gets back

192
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:46,660
within an hour when we send a script
because I'll like keep a script for like

193
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,250
three weeks.
And then by the time I read it,

194
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:51,850
the parts we can cast
Tom Cruise,

195
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:55,120
we'll read a script and an hour and get
back to them and either like it or not

196
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,040
it like he's

197
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,030
just like on the ball,
he's,

198
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,120
he's like,
he's trying to win,

199
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,600
he's won.

200
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,600
It's an inhuman instinct because our
human instinct is to just atrophy in a

201
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,700
way.
I mean you have to kind of fight it,

202
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,340
but easy to be lazy and to
procrastinate.

203
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,180
It's definitely easy to be lazy,
but it's not if you're going to be Tom

204
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:17,730
cruise or really have to be on the ball,
there's no other way.

205
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,470
It doesn't just,
he doesn't know time job.

206
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,380
That's not just what's going on.
And those,

207
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,590
there's some weird alien sort of
behavior patterns that we don't

208
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,050
recognize as being normal.
Like when he jumped up on Oprah's couch

209
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,311
is like,
I'm in love,

210
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,750
I'm in love him and love.
And everyone's like,

211
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,730
what the fuck is going on here?
Right Person?

212
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,010
No,
it's like a person who doesn't

213
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,100
understand French,
but you're speaking French to a French

214
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:40,400
person who's saying all the right words,
like,

215
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,860
what the fuck is wrong with this guy?
It seems like every choice he makes

216
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,600
outside of acting is based on what he's
assuming normal human beings think is

217
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:52,020
the normal behavior because the love is
when you jump on a couch and go,

218
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,920
I love her.

219
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,710
Which is informed by movies really.
Right.

220
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,450
Like that's more movie like,
right.

221
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:59,610
That's like John Cusak and say anything
like,

222
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,840
oh,
that's what love looks like.

223
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:01,980
It's not,
you know,

224
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,620
or telling a bunch of the fellows,
you know,

225
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,311
oh,
we're gonna have sex.

226
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,930
Talk with the fellows.
Also,

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,650
I looked at my wife off the friction of
her vagina.

228
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,320
Makes me just sploosh alright guys.
And everyone's like,

229
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,500
we're sick of fucking r was never.
I've,

230
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,540
I've just done relate to that joke that
you made.

231
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,230
That's so sweet.
Yeah.

232
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:26,190
What a fucking strange guy.
He might be one of the strangest guys of

233
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,470
all time.
I wish you would just come clean with

234
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:32,010
like one day just to sit down and just
be like,

235
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,700
given some ecstasy and have them just
talk about who he is.

236
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,140
Like I don't even know the fuck I am and
now I've been scientology for so long.

237
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,850
Like 13 guys last year was worried.
They're going to tell.

238
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,750
I'm always worried.
They're going to tell you.

239
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,180
He did Chris Hardwick's podcast,
right?

240
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,840
He did.
He did a one on one interview.

241
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,420
I listened to it recently.
I wish you could get them on here

242
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,140
because you,
you,

243
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,370
you get a,
you get in.

244
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:01,860
But I don't think you could pierce that
impenetrable layer.

245
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,590
I think he be fake with you to.
Even if he's fake,

246
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:06,360
you find out if he's fake to find some
stuff.

247
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,620
I will visit.
You still appears.

248
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,660
He was telling Chris like,
I love movies.

249
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:10,890
You know,
I'm passionate about movies.

250
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:12,420
And Chris Goes,
oh yeah,

251
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,950
like what are some of your favorite
movies?

252
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,880
This is how politically like constructed
he is.

253
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,360
He goes,
yeah,

254
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,370
just move a movies.
All movies,

255
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,350
all movies.
So he quit.

256
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,380
He was
just no different.

257
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,710
Biggest movie star couldn't pick three
movies that have inspired because he

258
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,970
didn't want them to like,
you know,

259
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,370
a Spielberg,
a Bruckheimer and the blah blah blah,

260
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,360
because then he piss off Coppola and
Scorsese and you know,

261
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,050
I mean,
it's all a construct.

262
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,550
God,
I want to meet him.

263
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,940
Yeah.
I can't believe he did Chris's.

264
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,570
That's so cool.
You should have them on the show.

265
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,830
You could get it.
I think I got.

266
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,850
I got faith.
You could get it.

267
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,430
I've had this guy on Ron miscavige who's
David Miscavige is dad.

268
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,330
Oh Wow.
Who's

269
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:58,480
scientology?
And I had Leah Remini on and we talked

270
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:03,481
for three hours about how crazy her life
and scientology was near a classic sp.

271
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,710
There's no way you're getting a
suppressive person.

272
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,730
Oh No,
I'm not.

273
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,500
I'm just misunderstood.

274
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,140
I got to say though,
that the more I learned about the

275
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:15,040
Catholic faith and all these kid fuckers
keep coming out,

276
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,780
the more I'm like,
that's the worst one.

277
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,420
Did you see the new one keepers don't
know the new.

278
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,170
There's a thousand cases of child
molesting that they just uncovered.

279
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,770
Shut down that religion.
Catholic trump monsters.

280
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,680
No,
no,

281
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,750
I'm not doing a pit,
but all $8,000 it was connected to the

282
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:36,460
church at Jamie will find it.
It was just some.

283
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,220
I mean I didn't even read it because I
looked at the headline and the first

284
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,250
thought was de and second thought was,
Ugh,

285
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,250
like you just can't.

286
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,880
I mean it's so much worse than like
making some unbelieved they can get

287
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:49,970
acting work like whatever scientology
does.

288
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:55,250
Like the Catholic religion is like their
fucking little girls and boys and like

289
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,120
permanently ruining their lives,
making them have like terrible

290
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:02,510
flashbacks,
making them have like wide chunks of

291
00:13:02,511 --> 00:13:05,570
memory that they just don't remember.
Then they do remember and it's like,

292
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:08,510
it's just the worst thing you can do.
And how do you like sexual problems?

293
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,250
I'm not Catholic and Jewish now.

294
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,430
Well,
you know the pope,

295
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,560
the pope,
ratzinger,

296
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,430
that guy.
One of the things that they do,

297
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,670
one of the reasons why he stepped down
was because they,

298
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,990
they found out that he was one of the
guys that used to move people around

299
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,820
common.
He was one of the guys.

300
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:25,680
When someone get caught molesting
children,

301
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,680
he would move into a new new precinct

302
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,513
that,
what do you call it?

303
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,790
That's what takes your breath away.
We live actually right next to a

304
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,820
rehabilitation center,
former rehabilitation center for wayward

305
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:36,170
priests on our street

306
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,441
and I was like,
oh.

307
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,161
I always thought,
oh,

308
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:40,080
wayward praise.
Like I wonder what that means.

309
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:41,910
And then after we saw that movie
spotlight,

310
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,790
we looked it up and that's exactly where
they were.

311
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,630
Housing p one was one of the places they
were housing the molesters

312
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,360
follow.
It makes this really interesting point

313
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:53,780
about the church,
which is the commonly held sort of folk

314
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:57,140
belief about the Catholic church is that
when you take away someone's ability to

315
00:13:57,141 --> 00:13:58,520
have sex,
you will.

316
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,910
You will concentrate their sex drive and
pervert it and you'll become a child

317
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:04,980
molester.
And what?

318
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,580
Spotlight the movie sort of point that
it makes us.

319
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:11,030
It's the other way around.
It's that that basically what you're a

320
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:13,160
child molester,
you go to the church because you know

321
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,390
they'll,
they'll give you a haven.

322
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,140
Don't feel cover for you.
It's true though,

323
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:20,100
like it is hard to become a priest.
You have to like study scripture for.

324
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,440
I mean,
how long has he been here?

325
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,790
Did molest a child?
You got to groom them,

326
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,230
you got to hang out.
You know what I mean?

327
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,840
But seriously know how true that.

328
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,580
So ratzinger moved to God that went onto
molest 100 deaf kids.

329
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,250
Yeah.
I saw this documentary because they

330
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,170
couldn't talk about it.
There would be.

331
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,600
Yeah,
but no one's gonna listen to them.

332
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,820
It's not like they can just start
talking,

333
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,250
you know what I mean?
It's like it's a weight just.

334
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,160
I mean he was working with deaf kids,
deaf orphans.

335
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,881
Well,
it's just,

336
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:49,040
it's not.
Nobody would listen to a deaf person.

337
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,250
It's it.
This is how scams one step removed.

338
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,540
Exactly.
It's one more.

339
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,420
What you want when you want as a
Predator is,

340
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,040
is the most vulnerable person that you
can be predatory towards.

341
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,320
It's like a documentary keepers.
It wasn't until this girl came to the

342
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,780
priest and said,
I actually have been molested.

343
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,250
He was like,
Oh,

344
00:15:08,251 --> 00:15:12,150
you have have you?
And then he started molesting or waited

345
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:14,010
for her to come into.
It was a confession.

346
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,080
Found that she was weak,
she was weak.

347
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,360
And then that's who we picked.
So it's like,

348
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,010
why remember these Nigeria?
Speaking of psychotic.

349
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:22,120
It's insane.
Yeah.

350
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,660
But that's what they want.
They,

351
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,300
the molester.
Lester loves the weak,

352
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,680
the weak and vulnerable.
Because if they go to a strong confident

353
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,410
child who they know,
what would it be like if you touch me,

354
00:15:32,411 --> 00:15:37,411
I'll tell my fucking dad molested.
That girl's got a big mouth also.

355
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:40,810
You do not touch her.
I've seen your,

356
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,100
your baby pictures.
You want a hug.

357
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,030
Okay.
And I was always trying to.

358
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:48,070
Yeah.
But it's very much always boys,

359
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,460
right?
Keepers.

360
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,633
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

361
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,030
It's girls and boys.
It's like who?

362
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,400
I've only seen documentaries on boys,
but the boys thing is weird,

363
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:00,140
but I kind of.
I do believe there's a math to like

364
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,270
suppressing someone's sexuality and then
it's just gonna come out in these other

365
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:04,680
ways.

366
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,890
Well,
I think that also monsters are

367
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,630
orientation is spread equally across
monsters.

368
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,950
So oriented.
Yeah.

369
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,060
I think that.
I don't even know.

370
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,040
Are you gay?
If you're a child molester,

371
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,360
likes little boys,
is that even gay?

372
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,030
That seems like a third thing.
Just you're,

373
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,410
you're,
you're not even in a sexual zone

374
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:23,880
anymore.
Now you're in a pathology zone.

375
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,600
But since the cases are so,
there's so many cases,

376
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:31,080
like maybe we should just let priests
get married or something needs to

377
00:16:31,081 --> 00:16:31,530
change.

378
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,550
Well,
they used to be able to,

379
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,980
but they were rockstars.
The problem was back in the days like

380
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,850
the,
during the Lutheran days when Martin

381
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,310
Luther was around,
priests controlled everything.

382
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,530
I mean,
they fucked everybody's wives.

383
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:44,071
They,
they,

384
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,980
the pope.
The pope had wives and children.

385
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,200
Pope's had wives,
they had children,

386
00:16:49,201 --> 00:16:50,550
they had money,
they had armies.

387
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,090
The Roman Catholic Pope controlled
armies.

388
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,960
They controlled troops.
Like it was a totally different scene

389
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,960
and then somewhere along the line they
were fucking so many women that were

390
00:17:00,961 --> 00:17:01,794
like,
Hey,

391
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,900
here's the new role.
You're going to be a priest.

392
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,480
You can't fucking chicks.
And then just the whole thing went,

393
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,460
hey,
does anybody know why that happened?

394
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,440
Why the changeover happened?
Because they were rock stars.

395
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:11,550
Because there were banging everybody.

396
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,180
No Sir.
Why they made them not raw.

397
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:13,940
Okay.
It,

398
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,210
they were too irresponsible.

399
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,900
This is what I've read.
What I've read is that there were,

400
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,440
there was a real concern amongst people
that were,

401
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,750
you know,
under the tutelage of these priests that

402
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,420
these guys were out of control.
They're just banging everybody

403
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:31,500
find out what was the reason why they
made them not able to say,

404
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,720
I wonder what you think that is.

405
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,520
It wasn't that long ago.
Elaine was like a thousand years ago.

406
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,970
It might've been less.
That's so interesting.

407
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,220
I think it was less than a thousand
years ago because I know that during the

408
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:46,510
[inaudible] con era,
the pope still at armies and I think

409
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,260
still,
I think there were still allowed be

410
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:50,030
married and have children

411
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,300
and they were using their religious
status to abuse

412
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:59,710
their power and probably probably women
would like fall for them too.

413
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,810
There was no cigarette.
If there's no musicians,

414
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:07,811
there's no comedian who was going to go
to the are going to go.

415
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,160
The gestures are.
They had comics back then.

416
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,930
It was good with like a floppy hat.
Yeah,

417
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:15,490
but they were like cruise ship comics.
They couldn't get out of line at all.

418
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,390
They got killed.
I still rock stars.

419
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,010
They were just like had white hair and
like,

420
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:21,500
what's the deal with the latrine that
you have to shift in?

421
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,250
What is the deal with cornish game hen
the white hair play the piano.

422
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:27,090
That was later.
That was like,

423
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,560
yeah,
this is like a dude plucking a lute.

424
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,910
Right?
I'd like to find out.

425
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:32,840
Yeah,
probably right.

426
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,040
Your harp have a timeline.
Is this idea that the guy,

427
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,240
the itinerant singer that would come to
talent and luck pluck the loot and tell

428
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:44,380
like the tail was always fucking
everybody everywhere went.

429
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,930
That's got to be who we,
who.

430
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:48,300
We all came from.
It was like Robert Plant came from the

431
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:51,540
gestures.
Rock are versus comedian,

432
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,790
right?
We were the people who would come in on

433
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,000
a wagon and juggling balls of manure.
You know,

434
00:18:57,001 --> 00:19:00,030
like the king has the years of that.
I would like to see you on the head with

435
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:00,864
a baguette.

436
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:04,830
Do you think that you guys have like
genetic ancestry to former comedians?

437
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,903
Um,

438
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,240
I believe in that more than most of us.
I believe.

439
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,810
I don't believe,
I just feel like I have a blood memory

440
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:12,100
of like,
like for example,

441
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:15,190
I do think there are people in comedy
who are doing it because that's where

442
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:18,430
like the energy is right now and they're
just like trying to like make money and.

443
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,530
Right.

444
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,950
Yeah.
Or whoever or.

445
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,380
I think it's moved beyond that.
It's like now it's like everybody that

446
00:19:23,381 --> 00:19:27,130
you would have been a dj when I was like
17 is now a comedian.

447
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,450
Right?
Is a lot of that.

448
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,460
But I love you guys.
Well,

449
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,800
what I was going to.
I don't really care.

450
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,680
I mean I think you just have to like
yourself.

451
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,930
It doesn't bother me.
I think it's cool because when you go

452
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:41,740
big then the 10 percent of geniuses that
wouldn't have started.

453
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,620
If it wasn't cool.
We'll start and then the 90 percent of

454
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:46,380
people that we're going to be garbage.
What do they.

455
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,100
They don't matter.
Damn Ninety 10,

456
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:49,130
Huh?
Fuck.

457
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,280
Probably less.
Probably 90 nine.

458
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:56,281
One genius person that starts comedy.
That to becoming like a forget genius

459
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,840
person that starts comedy does a set at
an open mic to becomes like one of the

460
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,010
great comedians,
like even in the top 10 percent of

461
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:08,290
comedians that's,
that's gotta be one percent.

462
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,790
That's the point that time.
But the problem with is like you say

463
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:17,380
once they start,
because the 99 point nine percent that

464
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:20,890
start never even make it.
That's part of it.

465
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,290
Yeah.
But like it's like the one percent that

466
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,280
do the point one percent that actually
become professional committees.

467
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,430
Like how many people out of your group
of open microbes that used to hang with,

468
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,080
how many are still doing standup?

469
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,690
That ratio because how many of them have
a TV show?

470
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:39,330
All of them.
Like it's easier to be famous now.

471
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,900
So your ratios are a little off.

472
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,520
I remember when.
Well yeah,

473
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:44,930
no,
the,

474
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,740
the,
the numbers are very start.

475
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:49,870
I remember when I first started like I
would have,

476
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,020
I would have fucked a let a man fuck me
50 times to get like a Montreal spot and

477
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:58,890
now it's like 50 times.
I've thought about it a lot and they

478
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,760
would,
they would rub my back very gently and

479
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,920
smuggling take me on like Alonzo Bowden.
Okay.

480
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,550
That he could do 25 times.
Dude.

481
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,070
I looked at Alonzo Bowden's fingers once
and I was like,

482
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,130
there are men with Dick smaller than
your finger off for sure.

483
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,890
Bottom line.
Dick.

484
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,530
Smaller than your finger.
Oh yeah.

485
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,930
Oh,
well that's rough.

486
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,070
If that's true.
It's true.

487
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:18,860
Anyway,
Alonzo,

488
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,350
if you're listening,
every time I look at your hands,

489
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,640
I think it was Dick's small ticks.
Interesting.

490
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,310
But my boy,
Oh,

491
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:29,250
I would've done anything for a Montreal
spot or,

492
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,670
or,
or a spot on,

493
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,230
on,
on the tonight show.

494
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,560
And now there's young comics who like
are like,

495
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,090
Nah,
I'm not really trying to like be a

496
00:21:37,091 --> 00:21:39,460
second lead on a show right now.
I'm really waiting.

497
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:41,560
Well from my vehicle it things have
changed.

498
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,660
I dated a girl that was like that.
She was like,

499
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:45,880
I don't want to do TV.
I'm holding out for film because I was

500
00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:50,080
on a television show at the time and she
was saying that she didn't want to do

501
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:52,030
TV.
It's like it was beneath her.

502
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,770
Oh,
and you're doing tv at the time.

503
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,580
Was that news radio?
Yeah.

504
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,473
Yeah,
yeah.

505
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,480
Great.
So I'm a fan of that show.

506
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,110
I took an acting class with Paris Hilton
and she and the teacher was like,

507
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,860
who wants to do tv?
And everyone raised their hand except

508
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:06,521
her.
And it was like,

509
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,380
who wants to do just movies in Paris?
Hilton,

510
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,310
right.
It's terrific course once we legit.

511
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,840
That's so fun.
That was the thing in the nineties.

512
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,600
Yeah.
I guess know the Paris Hilton is one of

513
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:21,490
the top highest paid djs in the world.
She can't have good taste in music.

514
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,420
Be a DJ.
She's not a DJ.

515
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,390
Also has like 20 perfumes and suck
should go into deejaying.

516
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,020
It seems like it's an open market.
Dominate if you have half a sense of

517
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:32,720
entertainment.

518
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,980
That guy's got a billboard on sunset.
Most is like,

519
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,720
he is like deejaying at a swimming pool
in Las Vegas.

520
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,020
It was a huge famous celebrity Dj.
You know how in La you'll always know

521
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:46,510
what's happening in Vegas.
Paul Harris or one of those guys,

522
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,630
and it was literally you look down and
it's like Vegas Swim Club,

523
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,400
Dj in a pool,
but those pools will have 15,000 people

524
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:58,120
stuffed into the area going crazy.
Horny dude.

525
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:00,210
That's probably where I would hang out
with one girl.

526
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,620
She's going to go hang out.
She's on her way.

527
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,930
She's going,
we're stopping there on the honeymoon

528
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:09,931
tour where a Nixon mask and just go
crazy and mix it with like a beautiful

529
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:15,421
naked woman body with a Nixon mask on.
I heard that they recently,

530
00:23:16,991 --> 00:23:19,480
this could be bullshit,
started making more money on their

531
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,650
nightclubs and on the.
On the casinos.

532
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,520
That's got to be true.
It may be.

533
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,440
I don't know.
I don't know what the numbers are,

534
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:28,670
but I would imagine they make a lot of
money on the casinos.

535
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,870
People like,
what's up?

536
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,780
I just heard John Taffer,
that guy that does bar rescue talking

537
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:38,680
about it on another interview,
he said they'll go in on Friday night

538
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:42,670
and make about 500,000 bucks for their
clubs show and then wake up the next

539
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,200
morning and do the pool at noon for 150.
You don't know.

540
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,780
You're talking about the actual
performance.

541
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,540
We're talking about the club itself.
You're talking about the casino.

542
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,650
The casino makes.
But imagine that if the Dj mix $650,000

543
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:57,350
for a weekend,
you got to multiply that by what?

544
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,120
Twenty 100 percent.

545
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,900
Well,
they may have the odd person like I am

546
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,670
on that show dice about Andrew dice
clay.

547
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:06,380
Have you ever had him do this?
Many times as you know?

548
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:10,260
I mean I didn't know a real thing,
but in the show,

549
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:14,670
the whole premise is that he's paying
off his gambling debt to the casino

550
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,760
because it's like $800,000 and it's the
only way you can pay it back.

551
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:20,530
But that's a true story.
He was in debt,

552
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:23,190
like he would lose $800,000 in one
night.

553
00:24:23,191 --> 00:24:24,810
So as long as they have people like
that,

554
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,270
they must be making a lot of money,
right?

555
00:24:27,271 --> 00:24:28,110
Yeah.
There's always gonna be.

556
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,590
It was always like the old lady like
putting in nickels but then there's also

557
00:24:31,591 --> 00:24:32,550
like dice,

558
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,740
but you also have to think like how much
money does it cost to run a casino?

559
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,690
The overhead is insane.
Right.

560
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,560
It's also,
they also exist in this odd like venn

561
00:24:41,561 --> 00:24:45,790
diagram of like a legal business and an
old world like criminal.

562
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,980
And I don't mean that in a Mafia.
Like don't they have like India,

563
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,730
like why is it even legal for them?
Yeah.

564
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,520
For them to let someone rack up an
$800,000 debt,

565
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,890
like a normal business business would
say,

566
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,230
sir,
you're $20 over your limit.

567
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,850
So we're going to go.
They just know,

568
00:25:00,851 --> 00:25:02,610
like he's got credit,
he's nice,

569
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,710
he's going to make money.
He's gonna.

570
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,600
He gambled away the deed to his house at
the Riviera and like they just lost my

571
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:15,180
hip,
hurt my Nana's wedding ring.

572
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,210
And then someone told me when I was at,
I was at foxwoods and they said because

573
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,110
I was performing and they said that at
Mohegan Sun,

574
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:22,681
they're like,
yeah,

575
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:26,130
it's gotten really bad at Mohegan Sun
when you gamble away your car,

576
00:25:26,131 --> 00:25:29,040
they won't even give you a ride home.
But we at foxwoods or giving people

577
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,540
rides like it's happening.
Like people are just like,

578
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,290
they run out of money and they're like,
okay,

579
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:36,780
I could win it all back if I just sell
the car.

580
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,180
And it's like they don't.
Yeah.

581
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,570
Here's what's interesting though,
if you,

582
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:43,820
when they ban you,
like my friend Dana,

583
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,300
Dana white is a notorious gambler,
but he wins millions of dollars

584
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:50,134
sometimes.
He's,

585
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,120
I think he said he lost his much as
$1,000,000 and he's won as much as 7

586
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,270
million in another.
Holy Shit.

587
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,210
Has He gotten banned from playing?
Really?

588
00:25:58,211 --> 00:25:59,240
Yes.
Dana.

589
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:02,110
He's a celebrity.
He only does he get banned,

590
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:04,780
but he gets banned and then he pulls the
UFC out of them.

591
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,530
Like these two do ufc at the palms and
he killed the palms and the palms

592
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:09,460
bandom.
So he's like,

593
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:11,590
fuck you Ben,
you and I moved to the hard rock or

594
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:13,300
wherever the hell they moved in next.
But yeah,

595
00:26:13,301 --> 00:26:15,520
they,
they've banned him from a bunch of

596
00:26:15,521 --> 00:26:17,530
casinos because he's really good at
blackjack.

597
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,640
Wow.
Can you.

598
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:21,760
What stakes is what?
What's the minimum bet for the Dana

599
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,990
White blocks?
I wish I knew.

600
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:24,310
That sounds fucking crazy.

601
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,030
How is that legal?
The band someone once they win at the

602
00:26:27,031 --> 00:26:28,230
thing you're saying?
I'm saying

603
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,860
these casinos are not fully legal there.
Like in this weird area.

604
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,770
They reserve the right to ban new if you
kicked their ass,

605
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,320
which is crazy.
Can they say you're card counting or

606
00:26:37,321 --> 00:26:38,790
something?
Not Card County.

607
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,230
I mean even if you are,
it doesn't matter.

608
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,850
It's legal.
I mean you can do whatever the fuck you

609
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,010
want I think.
I think it's as long as it's

610
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,200
on your head,
if you're not using a calculator or

611
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:49,560
something that's technically within the
rules of the game because your job is to

612
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:52,250
sit down and I guess cow card counting.
But blackjack.

613
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,910
I mean you're supposed to not know.
Like if you say,

614
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,900
if you have knowledge,
so we'll still ignore it and you know

615
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:59,730
how to count cards.
That's so stupid.

616
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:02,600
It's like a girl going to a bar watching
a guy roofie or drink up.

617
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:06,240
Can't pay attention to that.
Set the rules to know what the fucking

618
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:07,100
rules are.
Right?

619
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:11,870
The rules are like if you know how many
decks they're using and you know what

620
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,170
you know when not to hit and just play
it smart and count and thinking

621
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:21,171
calculate.
I know I also been a wiser retread.

622
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:25,680
Why does Dana the root thing,
we all accepted it sort of.

623
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,340
It's your house.

624
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,970
We were like,
ah,

625
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,990
Joe,
you got that?

626
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:28,760
But I was like,
hm,

627
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,620
that's
uh,

628
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,420
why?
Why does Dana white gamble or have no

629
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:36,050
idea?
The famous basketball player that like

630
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,580
Charles Barkley,
what drives those people?

631
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,540
There were so rich.
Why rules?

632
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,410
What is also people that have been hit
in the head a lot?

633
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:47,100
Dana has been hitting the head a lot.
I'm notoriously impulsive and

634
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,980
notoriously susceptible to addiction.
Whether it's gambling,

635
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,020
addiction,
alcoholic.

636
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

637
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,820
It's a big part of cte,
chronic traumatic encephalopathy,

638
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,560
which you see.
I think I said it right.

639
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,960
That's a brain damage from getting hit
in the head.

640
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:05,070
A big part of it,
it was a lot of boxing when he was

641
00:28:05,071 --> 00:28:05,904
young,
has been,

642
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,640
has dome,
rattled a gigabit time.

643
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,910
Scott,
that dome rattled here.

644
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:11,670
You're not supposed to get punched in
the head ever.

645
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,560
Right.
You definitely get punched in the head

646
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,180
multiple times a day for years.

647
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,210
What about like you train right now I
don't do any kickboxing sparring,

648
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,760
you know,
because of that.

649
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,900
Yeah,
and even in Jujitsu,

650
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,900
you like slam into someone's knee
accidentally or ahead.

651
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:27,390
You get your head bonked your dome
rabbit.

652
00:28:27,391 --> 00:28:31,920
It's not that common,
but when I was kickboxing boy I got hit

653
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:34,030
in the head a lot to the point where I
just like.

654
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,180
Sometimes I think about some of the
decisions I've made.

655
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,160
I'm like,
what's going on in their life?

656
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,010
What screws are loose?
Even with headgear,

657
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,300
you're saying you're still worse.
Here's worse.

658
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,340
Pickier.
It actually makes an a,

659
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,680
an artificial lever like save your head.
Is this large?

660
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,430
It means if you clip it here,
it's gotten more of a fulcrum effect,

661
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,680
whereas if your head is smaller and
compact and you just take it here,

662
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,240
so Richard Nixon mask would be bad
because they had a big old chin

663
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,700
knocking,
knocking little bit the rubber in the

664
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,610
mask,
but the the idea is not necessarily just

665
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,250
the initial impact,
it's how much your head moves,

666
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:08,940
like how might look.

667
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,190
The stronger your neck is,
the less likely you already get brain

668
00:29:11,191 --> 00:29:13,620
damage.
So these guys do a lot of neck exercises

669
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:16,440
just just just to keep their head stable
when it gets hit.

670
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,750
The idea is like the more your head
moves,

671
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:22,980
the more your brain's going swish around
inside your dome and and break off the

672
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:25,620
connective tissue.
That's also part of the problem is

673
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:27,960
connective tissue.
This like really soft,

674
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:31,050
almost like cotton candy,
like tissue that connects your brain to

675
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:33,240
the skull.
Which stuff gets ripped up.

676
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,750
Would you rather be a nfl?
Whatever the guy that linebacker thought

677
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,130
it is a chore or a Longterm Prize
Fighter,

678
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,410
longterm prize fighter for sure.
Longterm prize fighters can get through

679
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:46,840
it.
Like there's guys like Bernard Hopkins

680
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,650
that fought into his fifties who speaks
well,

681
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,680
you know,
and there's a.

682
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,220
see the problem is even guys that speak
well,

683
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,400
there's the weird shit that they do,
the impulsive stuff.

684
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,490
There's like if you talk to people that
are cte experts,

685
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,210
they tell you some really disturbing
things about brain damage,

686
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,690
about how it manifests itself in the
weird things that men find themselves

687
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:09,160
doing.
They don't even know why they're doing

688
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:11,170
it.
They're just doing it and like real

689
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:15,030
impulsive behavior and just stomping on
the gas on the highway and just like

690
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,360
weird gambling stuff and sex stuff and
drug stuff.

691
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,690
And a lot of it is connected to cte.
What have you looked over at?

692
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,633
Hofstra was crying,

693
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,700
looking at me.

694
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,710
So watching MMA,
like where they're like doing 69 and

695
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:34,400
just arriving,
arriving.

696
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:39,300
You're like,
one's got the head and in his dick and

697
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:43,020
then the other one's got his stick and
they just kinda like ride back and

698
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:43,854
forth.

699
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,490
And then just like one of the main
commentator

700
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,450
say,
right,

701
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,240
he's got,
oh,

702
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,240
he's got his head in his dick and
they're rising photons that have said

703
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:55,820
things along those lines.
See,

704
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,600
I listened

705
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,280
sport.
You have to understand from a woman

706
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,800
who's not into sports and then sees that

707
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,013
it's,
it's,

708
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,090
it's like I don't understand it.
She comes in and she says,

709
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,150
always did derisively did your team win?
I'm like,

710
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:14,850
there are no teams.
I mean I'm just

711
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:21,510
there barefoot.
Like they maybe have been fucking game.

712
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,840
That's the video.
The video game lets you get a little gay

713
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,400
or than the actual shoot.
Actually,

714
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,570
that's a good one.
You can actually fuck it was a great

715
00:31:31,571 --> 00:31:32,404
game.

716
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,910
Could be no,
it looks like a dude that's a.

717
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,330
that's a dude a triangle.

718
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,990
So it's people who don't.
They don't care about brain damage

719
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:40,580
though.
Like this sport,

720
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,190
this sport brings.
What is that funny?

721
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,340
I don't you think that's important.
They don't care about the cartilage that

722
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:47,330
connects their head

723
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:51,210
cartilages are the connective tissue,
connective tissue.

724
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,970
It's not that.
It's not that they don't care,

725
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,660
it's just that this is something that
they started doing when they were young.

726
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,010
They got really good at it and they see
it as a path to make career and they

727
00:32:02,011 --> 00:32:04,290
like thrills.
They like doing things dangerous and

728
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:07,470
excitements and exciting.
Some of them just accept the risks and

729
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:10,140
some of them say,
I would rather live a dangerous life.

730
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:12,150
That's exciting than a really fucking
boring.

731
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:14,910
Like sitting on the couch atrophying.

732
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,540
I can respect that.
I mean,

733
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,653
I.
of course

734
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,070
that's funny though.
This is like,

735
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:23,500
was like going to like on Davinci's
podcasts and being like,

736
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,560
I don't know about this art stuff.
I don't know about business

737
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,920
can take it.
I think you're right.

738
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,791
No,
you're right.

739
00:32:29,791 --> 00:32:32,430
My perspective is when I see it,
but I now.

740
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,860
Now you put it like that too.
It's like what?

741
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,250
What's the alternative?
Get A,

742
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,460
get a job in a factory or get a job,
you die.

743
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,070
This is temporary.
This

744
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,150
is not going to last.
Right?

745
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:44,840
So for them it's like,
how am I going to use my meat vehicle?

746
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,680
Yeah.
And am I going to use it for fun?

747
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:49,160
Just go crazy.
And I mean that's a,

748
00:32:49,161 --> 00:32:51,170
that's the thought process behind it is
like,

749
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:52,790
yeah,
I know I'm doing damage to it.

750
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:53,510
And I,
you know,

751
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,050
I know a lot of guys that have known
when they were in their prime where they

752
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:59,870
were just killing everybody and now they
are broken.

753
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,990
That's it.
I know guys who can't even brush their

754
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:05,450
teeth,
their shoulders are so shot.

755
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,150
They have to like brush their teeth
lefthanded and they suck at it and the

756
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,610
crazy fucking move their head.
And how old are they in their thirties?

757
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,760
Yeah.
There is something about the human

758
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:17,970
animal that wants.
It's an interesting facet of humanity

759
00:33:17,971 --> 00:33:21,000
that wants to achieve greatness for some
reason.

760
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,420
I will see the glory of winning in that
too is also directly related to the

761
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:30,080
danger of doing it.
It's like there's something dangerous

762
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:33,500
about it that makes it super exciting.
If you pull it off,

763
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,040
it's winning.
A fight is,

764
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:37,460
it's a crazy feeling

765
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,590
more than making all these other people
happy too because people have voted on,

766
00:33:41,591 --> 00:33:43,000
you know,
or how do you do it?

767
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:47,010
You vote on them or whatever.
Like you bet on them.

768
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,900
I mean it's like you're,
it's so many people just.

769
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:53,560
I've noticed so many people get their
mood is changed if their team wins.

770
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,423
So it's like

771
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,400
the problem with mma though I read when
Chuck Liddell started losing is when I

772
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,420
realized like MMA is not a good sport
for like having to have your guy when

773
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:09,080
eventually your guy will always lose
always because they'll get older.

774
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,760
That's just the inevitable reality.
Exactly.

775
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,310
The team dynamics,
your team can always be a winner,

776
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:20,000
but if you root for one fight or that
federal get old and the young people

777
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:23,360
will come in and it's like 38.
That's way old.

778
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,480
Thirty eight is whale,
so like 32 or something.

779
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Especially now with drug testing,
it used to be back in the day that when

780
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,600
you would get tested,
it was really like they would say it's

781
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:37,270
like an intelligence test.
It's more than a drug test,

782
00:34:37,271 --> 00:34:42,250
like just don't take anything the
remaining few days before your test and

783
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:45,010
they just testing your pee for like
really obvious stuff,

784
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,550
but now it's super comprehensive and
they use Usada,

785
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:53,260
US anti-doping association and they,
they fucking crawl up your ass with a

786
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:55,900
microscope.
People wake you up checking for what

787
00:34:55,901 --> 00:34:57,850
people want.
Yes.

788
00:34:57,851 --> 00:35:00,400
They are in the room.
Will look at your Dick because guys are

789
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:01,070
used rubber dam.

790
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,470
Yeah.
I went to Rehab when I was a kid so I

791
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:07,430
know I knew all the tricks to wizard
eaters or you'd get your homie to piss

792
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:09,320
into a bag and you'd have the bag in
your pocket.

793
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:11,610
What kind of drugs are mma?
People doing?

794
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,600
Steroids.
Steroids.

795
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,350
Oh right.
It's not like I know nothing about it.

796
00:35:16,351 --> 00:35:17,580
Like,
well that to make sense.

797
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,820
Legal.
So they're all doing it.

798
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,550
Why would they do it if it's illegal?
Joe?

799
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:28,000
I got to say your impression of Natasha.
Okay.

800
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,140
No roles.
Did you illegal drugs or.

801
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,690
No,
now I'm horny.

802
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:33,623
Okay,
hold on.

803
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,050
I just thought that people had a,
you know,

804
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,370
and that they wouldn't do that.
But you're saying they would all do it?

805
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,580
No,
not all.

806
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:47,030
There is definitely a core group of
champions who have never thought about

807
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:49,670
taking drugs and still don't have a
problem with steroids.

808
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:51,140
There's a lot to do.
Promo.

809
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,810
Sarah is also.
Is that when one person starts doing it,

810
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,520
the person beneath him either will lose
or has to be pressured to do it and so

811
00:35:58,521 --> 00:35:59,410
it creates this like,

812
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,520
and sorry if people out there are upset
that I'm not a sports fan,

813
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,720
I'm don't think about them.
Let's just talk.

814
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,070
Do you believe that's what's holding us
back?

815
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,550
Don't sweat it.
You do though?

816
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,010
I don't.
I mean I'm just like,

817
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,080
sports are holding us back.
Is that what you mean?

818
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,430
Thinks he's doing a what's elevating us?
That's holding us back.

819
00:36:19,431 --> 00:36:24,080
What's the elevator making sports like?
Our main thing I hate when sports are on

820
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:28,220
in any sort of public establishment.
I think it's aesthetically okay.

821
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:33,221
I want to tell yourself it's okay.
You don't like when you see sports in an

822
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,060
establishment.
I find it depressing,

823
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,310
depressing,
but what about law and order when you

824
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:39,630
watched that?
That's like one notch down,

825
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,590
but very depressing.
CSI.

826
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,690
Pull the head off the carpet to the
head.

827
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:52,720
For our Natasha I will say is a.
is extremely connected to aesthetics

828
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,830
more than any human being I've ever met.

829
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,400
I think tennis is a nice aesthetic.
There you go.

830
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,340
Okay.
I would.

831
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,860
I was told that's a sport.
I know.

832
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,790
It's okay.
I think like a tennis match.

833
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:05,690
Yeah,
I could handle that.

834
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,150
Why is that okay.
And like honestly because I like how

835
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:10,370
they like how they dress.
What about basketball?

836
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,303
No,
no,

837
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,820
I hate those long stories.
No,

838
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,880
I don't like baseball or
darkness to play tennis.

839
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,920
Yeah,
just a couple of chicks are really good

840
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:24,710
at it.
I mean I think

841
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,990
it's probably because I grew up and I
was always the last to get picked for

842
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:33,400
sports,
so maybe that's why it was so totally

843
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,210
want to go deep

844
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,070
when I hug you.
I'm always worried I'm going to break

845
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:36,500
you.
You,

846
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,780
you weighed like 80 pounds.

847
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,610
I wish you a hundred and five.

848
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,290
Come on.
You do not weigh 100 pounds.

849
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,790
You Line Yourself.
Do you do.

850
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,180
I mean,
I'm not like that skinny.

851
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:47,570
I'm just

852
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,530
small.
She weighs 105 while we fuck and it's

853
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,560
101.
We're not fucking I a five pound debt.

854
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,730
I mean I didn't.
I didn't want to mention that.

855
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:57,020
I asked the test and I had to bring it
up,

856
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,440
but it needs to be said.
Yeah.

857
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:03,450
I've got an Alonzo Bowden to have lots
of document for Alonzo and fingers.

858
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,090
You about the sport?
No,

859
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,191
you don't have to.
Excuse me.

860
00:38:07,191 --> 00:38:09,200
I don't like sports.
I also don't like video games.

861
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,050
The only thing I watch is fighting.
I literally don't watch sport.

862
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:13,250
I don't.
I don't even know the rules.

863
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,640
Like you don't like any sport other than
MMA and boxing.

864
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,050
I don't watch them.
I don't.

865
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,890
I don't even know when they're
happening.

866
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,230
Like when someone says,
oh,

867
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:22,160
just see the NBA championship game.
Like Oh,

868
00:38:22,161 --> 00:38:22,994
when was it?
No,

869
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,050
it was last night,
man.

870
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,270
You didn't watch.
I'm the same as the thing.

871
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,750
The only sport I watched his MMA and
have watched consistently since I was a

872
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:33,200
kid,
his mma and then boxing very secondarily

873
00:38:33,201 --> 00:38:35,050
and that I can't get into kickboxing at
all.

874
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,250
Really?

875
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,620
Laurie?
I've seen clips of everything.

876
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:41,410
I don't know why I can't.
I can't get into because I like him and

877
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:43,600
made much more than boxing.
But then you would think I would be more

878
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,070
in the kickboxing and boxing,
but I'm not.

879
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:50,190
Sports just seems like men exercising.
That's funny.

880
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,500
But like I just,
I mean I know it's more than that,

881
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,470
but like if you saw opera,
you'd probably be like,

882
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:59,920
this just seems like fat people
screaming or screened opera.

883
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,300
Do you like it?
No,

884
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,860
I felt like it was just like antiquated
form of entertainment that I watch.

885
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,290
I was super duper high when I went to
see you because I knew,

886
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,140
I knew I had to see.
It was like,

887
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,090
oh,
just I had to do a favor.

888
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,140
So,
uh,

889
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,520
when I,
when I went to watch,

890
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,180
I was like,
listen,

891
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm just kidding.
Bullies out of my fucking mind.

892
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,790
But what's interesting is I,
what I really started paying attention

893
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:26,791
to was all the people in the audience
and there's like this class of people

894
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:31,390
that probably live in Bel Air and
Beverly Hills and want to be seen at the

895
00:39:31,391 --> 00:39:35,350
opera and it's like a big deal to say
they're going to the opera and I was

896
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,300
watching this,
it was like they can't possibly like

897
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:39,100
this,
like even if they like it,

898
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:40,570
they don't like it,
that they don't like it.

899
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:42,310
Like people like the UFC.
That's true.

900
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,570
That's true.
You're right.

901
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,890
100 percent.
What he's saying is pretending to like

902
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,830
there's a different level to what the
light.

903
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,700
It's not true.
It's like sophisticated entertainment.

904
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,650
I mean like we went to the,
to the orchestra,

905
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:57,210
the symphony recently.
And I hated it.

906
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,780
I've been,
I went to the symphony when I was a kid

907
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:01,940
with my grandma.
She used to take me and there are some

908
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,990
bangers,
you know?

909
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,620
Yeah.
You know like Dun Dun,

910
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,900
a Banger,
the,

911
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,670
you know,
that he was just in there like doing

912
00:40:10,671 --> 00:40:12,890
this thing.
But we went to see,

913
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:13,850
I don't even.
Who Was it?

914
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,600
Mahler and you read the description,
Mahler and it's like laminations on

915
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:20,690
death,
not a discord and not pleasant to listen

916
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:22,820
to.
So we're going to go sit down for an

917
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,590
hour and a half.
Performance of like something that in

918
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:27,410
its description is like Natasha.
You didn't like it either,

919
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:27,860
did you?

920
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,210
No,
and there was like a low.

921
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,520
Moshe got in a fight with two different
elderly people.

922
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,590
He tried to help this woman.
I was walking in like double crutches.

923
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,930
It's so old you can't

924
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,790
imagine.
It's like it's so old and so white.

925
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:43,400
It's like unbelievable.
You can't believe it,

926
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,490
you know?
And I was walking in and this old man

927
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:51,820
was a sitting down and he's like 85,
and so I told him he started to get up

928
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:53,180
to let me throw it go,
you don't need to get up.

929
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:55,550
I can kind of crawl around you.
And he goes,

930
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,760
we're not all as young as you.
Some of us are gonna die soon.

931
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,830
And I was like,
Oh,

932
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:03,990
I'm trying to go.
I just read the wikipedia page.

933
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,550
I go like,
oh,

934
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,870
well I guess that's what we're here to
listen to.

935
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,850
Right,
and the guys,

936
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:13,270
nothing iced me out and I sit there like
bored and the worst and it's got.

937
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,880
It's the worst kind of symphony Mahler
because it always seems like it's ending

938
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,150
it be like,
Duh,

939
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:20,240
Dun Dun Dun,
and you're like,

940
00:41:20,241 --> 00:41:22,080
cool,
let's get the fuck out of it.

941
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,090
Done.

942
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,460
Never got the old lady who yelled at you
and she almost fell down the stairs.

943
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:26,760
Then as

944
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,030
we were leaving,
I was an old man and he was so feeble

945
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:34,640
and and wobbly that I was staring at his
body like in my mind,

946
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,680
you ever have this kind of situation
where you're like this,

947
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,960
this is going to,
this person's going to fall.

948
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,730
I can feel it in my bones were way
before it happened

949
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:47,360
in the steepest possible.
It would and I could feel it like if

950
00:41:47,361 --> 00:41:49,040
this guy's gonna fall,
he's too feeble.

951
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:52,850
He's too old to be ascending the stairs
and he sure enough does.

952
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:56,640
He just starts to tip over and he goes
for it because I was already like

953
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,080
looking at him.
I grabbed him by like the,

954
00:41:59,160 --> 00:41:59,800
the,
the,

955
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,210
the top,
the collar and the bottom of his jacket

956
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,590
and I just held him up,
right?

957
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,050
Oh my God.
And he fucking like,

958
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:10,430
just like shoved me off of him,
gave me a dirty look and stormed off.

959
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,260
And I was like,
I just saved your fucking life.

960
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:15,530
You all bitch wanted to go.
Maybe you want way to go.

961
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,050
Listen to them all.
I listened to Mahler out depressing

962
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,620
shit,
pretends he slips.

963
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,010
Listen to his wife complaining about her
stool.

964
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,540
I saw blood in my stool and he's like,
I'm just going to fall.

965
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,580
You know my grandma Gloria.
So to good,

966
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:34,670
steep angle,
my grandma said to me what he said to me

967
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:36,770
on her deathbed,
like days before she died,

968
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,380
she looked at me and she said,
if there is a god,

969
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,080
he saves a worst part of your life for
the very end.

970
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,470
It's like,
bye bye grandma.

971
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,060
Thinking about that,
because I was like going into a like an

972
00:42:48,061 --> 00:42:51,690
old person's home seems so depressing.
Like I would never want to do that to go

973
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:54,930
away from your,
your stuff in your house.

974
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,850
You know,
like,

975
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,810
I'm just trying to think what's the best
way to go.

976
00:42:57,811 --> 00:42:58,650
I think it will be

977
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:03,720
themselves in a home will alone when
they're super depressing too,

978
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,730
right?
Yeah.

979
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,030
Yeah.
I lived in New York when I first moved

980
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:09,220
there.
I stayed with my grandparents in New

981
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,350
Jersey and my grandmother had had an
aneurysm.

982
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,870
They gave her 72 hours to live.
She lived 12 years.

983
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,010
Wow.
Yeah,

984
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:15,520
Dude.
Yeah.

985
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,970
It was over those 12 years.

986
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,310
I was only there living with them for a
few months.

987
00:43:20,311 --> 00:43:22,830
I think I lived there for maybe five
months,

988
00:43:22,831 --> 00:43:24,990
six months,
but it was bad.

989
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,700
It was bad.
Like my grandfather,

990
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,060
they had a nun or a non.
A nurse would come over and they would

991
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:32,850
help,
but this like she would have horrible

992
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:34,170
bedsores.
She couldn't move.

993
00:43:34,171 --> 00:43:37,020
She was paralyzed.
She was completely vegetables.

994
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,400
She would talk a little bit on your
teeth were falling out.

995
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,230
They had all fallen out.
She want to live at that point.

996
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,620
No,

997
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:44,000
no,
no,

998
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,250
but I do think like the two ways,
the two main ways to die or like to have

999
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:49,230
a death bed,
like that seems kind of glamorous

1000
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:52,150
because then you could like call people
to you and give them wisdom and like

1001
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,910
have last words.
No,

1002
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:55,740
but if,
if you die in an accident,

1003
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:57,450
then you never get to have any of that.
No.

1004
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
You can't have those funny last year

1005
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,490
or the third way.
What is the,

1006
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,520
what is you,
you're a bit about your grandma and her

1007
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,490
deathbed.
I don't remember the third.

1008
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,300
The third way though is to go mad and to
shit your pants.

1009
00:44:10,301 --> 00:44:12,100
And two,
my grandmother didn't die like that

1010
00:44:12,101 --> 00:44:12,940
though.
That's just the job.

1011
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,010
My grandma did.
My grandma's great fear.

1012
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:19,570
Her entire life was becoming a feeble
senile person that was to herself and of

1013
00:44:19,571 --> 00:44:22,480
course it came true because the only way
to avoid that is to have a heart attack

1014
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:23,380
or an accident.

1015
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,440
I feel bad that I say that about my
Nana.

1016
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:26,560
It was just a dumb joke.

1017
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,341
Well,
you know,

1018
00:44:27,341 --> 00:44:31,560
they have assisted death now in
California and 11 people did it on the

1019
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,251
day.
That's crazy.

1020
00:44:32,251 --> 00:44:35,400
Please.
My absolutely did in the first day,

1021
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,550
which I absolutely believe in.
I mean I think God damn it.

1022
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,240
Why do we need to have people die of
natural causes when they're horribly

1023
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:43,074
suffering?
And

1024
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,600
that's a good question,
right?

1025
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:49,290
It's like what is suffering?
If you are physically fine,

1026
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,660
you have a 70 beats per minute resting
heart rate.

1027
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:54,320
You have no cancer but you just five
pounds everyday,

1028
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:57,150
five pounds deck every day.
Hating life.

1029
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,410
Yeah.
It's crazy.

1030
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:01,860
In Scandinavia where they've had
euthanasia for a long time,

1031
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,620
they started to accept that the person
who suffering from chronic depression

1032
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:12,060
can opt out and take assisted suicide as
a means to escape their depression.

1033
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,080
Isn't a part of the problem with pro,
with chronic depression,

1034
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,440
like we don't know what they're feeling.
Like if you.

1035
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,000
If like someone,
if you have a broken arm,

1036
00:45:19,001 --> 00:45:19,361
like,
okay,

1037
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:20,710
I broke my arm,
I kinda get it,

1038
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,530
but if someone says I have chronic
depression,

1039
00:45:23,531 --> 00:45:24,364
I was like,
okay,

1040
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,320
what does it feel like?
I don't know.

1041
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:29,470
I don't know what your depression is and
in your chronic depression might be

1042
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,270
different than another person and
another person.

1043
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:34,060
It's like,
how do you know that it can't be turned

1044
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:37,000
around with a pill or with exercise and
diet,

1045
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:40,900
and if you did turn it around like I
have friends that were suicidal and now

1046
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:42,760
they're super happy.
So it's hard.

1047
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,880
Well,
the problem is the main one of the main

1048
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:49,200
tenants of depression is hopelessness.
So if you can't feel at all hopeful,

1049
00:45:49,201 --> 00:45:52,170
how are you ever going to try to get
your way out?

1050
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,040
Another strange thing about mental
illness in my experience,

1051
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:57,000
and I have a lot of it in my family,
uh,

1052
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:00,930
and is that it always looks,
not always but it off,

1053
00:46:00,931 --> 00:46:03,860
except for schizophrenia and stuff.
Looks obviously like that person's sick

1054
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,890
and can't help it.
But with depression or alcoholism,

1055
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:10,520
that kind of thing.
It always feels like you could act

1056
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,490
differently if you just tried a little
bit harder.

1057
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,430
You could not be doing this.
You could be less depressed.

1058
00:46:16,431 --> 00:46:19,640
You could go apply for a job,
you could get up a look at the front.

1059
00:46:19,641 --> 00:46:22,220
He has schizophrenia.
You can see as impossible,

1060
00:46:22,221 --> 00:46:25,940
but it looks to the normal brain like
close enough to normal that they could

1061
00:46:25,941 --> 00:46:30,941
just change your circumstance if only
they tried harder and mental illness is

1062
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,000
maybe the inability to try harder,
so it's very seductive to the normal

1063
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:39,710
brain to think of mentally ill people is
like lazy or not trying to get better.

1064
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,570
Yeah.
I just think it's one of those very odd

1065
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,630
things to quantify of almost impossible.
Like I don't know what you're feeling,

1066
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,180
you know,
and what is like what's normal for some

1067
00:46:52,181 --> 00:46:53,430
people,
you know,

1068
00:46:53,431 --> 00:46:56,050
and like some people are just ecstatic
all the time and like what,

1069
00:46:56,051 --> 00:46:57,190
what is normal for them.

1070
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,340
And also the antidepressants are like
literally just a chemical experiment

1071
00:47:02,471 --> 00:47:04,930
with somebody's brain,
go tinkle this and do this.

1072
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,720
Yeah.
I know people who ever since they

1073
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:08,940
started taking antidepressants,
it's changed their life and their

1074
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,890
lifestyle better.

1075
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,670
Sure.
Have you ever taken either of you ever

1076
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:13,050
taken an antidepressant?
No.

1077
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,370
Someone gave me some adderall once.
That's not similar bid on entity.

1078
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,300
I was on it when I was a kid when I was
a 13,

1079
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,050
12 year old media personality.
Changing,

1080
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,280
I remember my brain doing things to me
that I didn't like physically.

1081
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,860
Like I started to see things in the
horizon of my vision.

1082
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:31,270
I started diff.
My,

1083
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:35,620
I started to feel like less hungry.
I started to like see things in the

1084
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:37,370
horizon of your vision,
you know,

1085
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,090
like actual apparitions,
not apparitions,

1086
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:40,660
like,
uh,

1087
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:44,020
like sort of like sort of hallucinogenic
fractal situations,

1088
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:46,450
you know,
I started to see that and it just like I

1089
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:49,390
could feel it tinkering with my brain.
I of course,

1090
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,920
what was happening was I was getting
given antidepressants to combat,

1091
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:56,410
like being a juvenile delinquent,
like Druggie,

1092
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,130
and so it wasn't treated.
It wasn't treating thing that existed.

1093
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:01,950
So a psychiatrist gave you this?
Yeah,

1094
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,900
I was all fucked up with psychiatrists
that is will give you,

1095
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:05,950
that's the real problem,
right?

1096
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,420
They'll give it to people that don't
need it.

1097
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,420
That's what's happening with the opiod
crisis.

1098
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:10,790
Like they'll,
people just like,

1099
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,130
they'll just give you oxycontin.
Like it just seems so crazy.

1100
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,170
It was crazy.
This doctor told me this weekend,

1101
00:48:17,171 --> 00:48:22,171
I was talking to a family member that's
a doctor that it takes eight days of,

1102
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,130
of a regimen of,
of what's the drug in the,

1103
00:48:26,131 --> 00:48:28,180
in the car.
There's one drug that the,

1104
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,970
all the opiate addicts are getting
addicted to Oxycontin.

1105
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,010
It's not oxycontin,
fentanyl,

1106
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,280
fentanyl.
It takes me for dead eight days to get

1107
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,390
hooked and a and a treatment regiment is
something like 12 days.

1108
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,590
So it's like everybody that's given the
treatment regimen for regular pain is,

1109
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,550
is having to kick it when they get off.
And that's why.

1110
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,680
That's why we've got a crisis that is
incredible.

1111
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,050
That eight days in you're hooked.
It's insane

1112
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,540
because everybody who takes,
if you break your leg or something,

1113
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:57,280
they give you fentanyl.
No.

1114
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,650
Um,
I don't know why they give it to you.

1115
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,910
Medical marijuana for a broken leg for
pain is real simple.

1116
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,050
I mean,
you're saying it like you haven't

1117
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:07,750
thought it through like that because
they make a lot more money selling you

1118
00:49:07,751 --> 00:49:09,760
something you can't get anywhere else.
Too naive.

1119
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,820
It's not like the first rule of being a
doctor.

1120
00:49:13,821 --> 00:49:14,654
We're not going to hurt

1121
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,320
relationships with pharmaceutical
companies.

1122
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:19,260
I mean,
so it's a standard appointment believe

1123
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,520
that people are like that,
but there's also a bunch of doctors that

1124
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:24,100
are ignorant to the actual positive
benefits of pot.

1125
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:25,870
They have a negative association about
pot.

1126
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:28,690
People don't smoke pot,
but also to get real.

1127
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,610
Like if you have a compound fracture,
you don't.

1128
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,640
What you need is more than medical
marijuana at least at first.

1129
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,510
You don't agree with me.
Oh,

1130
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,840
you would take your phone.
Is your bones sticking out of your leg

1131
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,680
and your parts.
You pop it back in and what you.

1132
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,500
What would you take?
Only once you get the cast on it,

1133
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:46,140
you're fine.
It just,

1134
00:49:46,141 --> 00:49:48,310
she just sit there.
It sucks when you move,

1135
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,910
but you don't have to take that stuff.
You don't have medical marijuana.

1136
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,020
Supposedly they did a recent test and 93
percent of people with chronic pain

1137
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,480
preferred marijuana over opiates.

1138
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,190
God,
I can.

1139
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,720
My mom has pain and like she's never
tried drugs and I just can't get her to

1140
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:04,231
try.
You know,

1141
00:50:04,231 --> 00:50:07,950
like there's such a stigma,
like she'd probably try phentenol before

1142
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,860
because a doctor,
a doctor said it was okay.

1143
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,920
Then marijuana.
I wish we could change the.

1144
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:19,300
We are not a fan of pain pills.
I hear you reconstructed and I didn't

1145
00:50:19,301 --> 00:50:20,810
take anything.
I just.

1146
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,450
I'm like,
I'm not taking them.

1147
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,420
We took marijuana though.
Or Smoking Pot luck.

1148
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,040
How much did you suffer?
It's not that

1149
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,690
bad.
It's just paint.

1150
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,553
Depends on your.

1151
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,400
Yeah.
That's the kind of pain that you just

1152
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:32,761
go,
okay,

1153
00:50:32,761 --> 00:50:34,530
well that's what that feels like.
Okay,

1154
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,530
now I know what that is.
Back pain is one of the harder ones.

1155
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,180
Like everything you do,
that's a very overrated pain by the way.

1156
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,360
It's nothing.
It's like scratches.

1157
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:46,440
It feels like.
I know I've heard people say it hurt

1158
00:50:46,441 --> 00:50:49,630
more than anything in their life,
so your people are pussies,

1159
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,380
doesn't it?
Doesn't hurt them.

1160
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:54,340
It just doesn't hurt that much.
It really just does.

1161
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,300
It just absolutely does not hurt that
much.

1162
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,750
There's spots where it's not comfortable
like bones,

1163
00:51:00,751 --> 00:51:03,870
like elbow bone when they go over the
elbow bone and oddly enough,

1164
00:51:03,871 --> 00:51:05,550
like right when they get close to your
chest,

1165
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:08,220
that's painful,
but not childbirth.

1166
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:10,260
There's fucking manageable.
You just go,

1167
00:51:10,261 --> 00:51:11,910
whoa.
It was like just.

1168
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,350
I think a lot of it is just how you
think about the course and the fester.

1169
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,330
What's the most painful?
Does anyone know what the most painful

1170
00:51:19,331 --> 00:51:22,450
thing of human being can experiences?
What's like?

1171
00:51:22,451 --> 00:51:25,990
The top threshold seems to be a compound
fracture is as bad as it gets,

1172
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,430
but maybe I'm told I just seems awful.
Broken.

1173
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:34,360
Broken bones suck and broken.
A compound fractures is a broken bone

1174
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:36,370
and in a horrible laceration.
Oh,

1175
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:37,540
right.
I guess that's true.

1176
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,820
I have a broken arm and it wasn't that
bad,

1177
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,500
but burning.
I think you're right.

1178
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:44,560
Burning burning is one of the most
absolutely painful ones.

1179
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,180
Burning,
not burning to death.

1180
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,580
I think that that's rough,
that recovery process from.

1181
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:51,580
Do you know that when burn victims are
in the hospital,

1182
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,970
other burn victims,
random strangers go to them and talk to

1183
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:55,804
them.
Wow.

1184
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,480
I didn't know that.
My friend Zack is that craiger who's

1185
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:01,360
from the widest kid,
you know,

1186
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:03,520
and he's a successful actor.
He's on that show,

1187
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:04,360
wrecked.
Uh,

1188
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:09,160
he told me he burned himself at a party
in the Caribbean and in the Caribbean

1189
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,760
people would go visit,
burn victims from the Caribbean would go

1190
00:52:12,761 --> 00:52:17,110
visit him
because apparently the pain is so

1191
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:18,680
intense and insane that they

1192
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:21,860
interesting.
Let me say this now before I forget.

1193
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:23,770
Um,
people who love Steve.

1194
00:52:23,771 --> 00:52:24,260
Oh,
Steve.

1195
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,071
Oh,
did something.

1196
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:28,130
I don't know what the fuck he did,
but on his instagram,

1197
00:52:28,131 --> 00:52:30,020
if you're going to denver this weekend,
Steve,

1198
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:33,620
I was going to be in Denver.
He has horrible burns all over his body

1199
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:37,790
and he's looking for some sort of an emt
to take care of him,

1200
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:40,940
like someone to help him dress his
wounds because he's still going to do

1201
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:43,670
his shows at the comedy works and
apparently it's going to.

1202
00:52:43,671 --> 00:52:45,680
You won't tell the story of what
happened to him,

1203
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:48,440
but he put it because he wants to tell
it onstage,

1204
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:53,680
but he put these images will put a video
of it up on instagram and his fucking

1205
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:57,780
skin is falling off of his arm.
Really bad.

1206
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,390
Yeah,
it looks really bad.

1207
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,590
Don't do your show,
Dude.

1208
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,990
Want to say to Steve,
have you listen to this?

1209
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,770
There's a new stem cell therapy that
they've created for people that have

1210
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:11,771
burns where they spray stem cells all
over the burn and the healing time is

1211
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,860
radically reduced as well as the
scarring.

1212
00:53:15,861 --> 00:53:19,610
The scarring is radically reduced.
So another thing we tend to look into

1213
00:53:19,611 --> 00:53:20,010
that

1214
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:25,010
they put tilapia skin on the burner you
heard about this low fish scales on

1215
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:29,580
apparently is one of the much so much
more healing than bandages.

1216
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,090
I don't know why,
but it like creates this sort of,

1217
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:34,890
you know,
skin on skin healing and it did

1218
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,290
apparently the doctors trying

1219
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,460
prostitutes burn victims using fish
skin.

1220
00:53:39,461 --> 00:53:42,550
That's fascinating.
I'm going to be okay.

1221
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,370
He's going to be okay.
But he's gotta go to the Steevo

1222
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:50,260
instagram page so you could see it.
But this stem cell treatment is pretty

1223
00:53:50,261 --> 00:53:51,970
radical.
Like they've shown people with third

1224
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:53,860
degree burns.
They sprayed on them and in a couple of

1225
00:53:53,861 --> 00:53:55,660
days it's gone.
That's crazy.

1226
00:53:55,661 --> 00:53:57,490
Yeah.
Like literally no scar.

1227
00:53:57,491 --> 00:53:59,350
No nothing.
It just heals.

1228
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:00,620
That's interesting.
Yeah.

1229
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:01,471
I mean it's,
we're,

1230
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,250
we're in a new world.
Uh,

1231
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,750
not this.
And the next one.

1232
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,510
The next one.
Did you take it off?

1233
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:08,740
What about that one?
Oh,

1234
00:54:08,741 --> 00:54:09,870
that man,
he took it down.

1235
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:11,940
That's a video of him getting blood
poured on his face.

1236
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,220
Took it down.
Whoa.

1237
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,820
That's crazy.
He was asking for people to come and see

1238
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:23,260
him in Denver,
like all that stuff all over his body.

1239
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:26,650
All those.
Like he showed what that looked like.

1240
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,240
Click on that because it just seems
like.

1241
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:29,471
Yeah,
fuck.

1242
00:54:29,471 --> 00:54:33,970
This is one video that he had.
This is not going to show anything,

1243
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:37,960
but the next video he showed what's
going on under those bands

1244
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,500
and it's horrific.
Oh,

1245
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,050
maybe it got flagged.
What's,

1246
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,920
what's the most painful thing you've
ever experienced?

1247
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:47,790
I don't know.
Um,

1248
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,470
I feel like I'm so lucky.
What about you?

1249
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,290
You got nothing.
Your shoulder?

1250
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,320
I'm a baby.
Her shoulder popped out in Hawaii and it

1251
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:57,650
was painful though.
It was.

1252
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:01,080
I just don't like getting blood drawn.
I felt very weak as a man at that

1253
00:55:01,081 --> 00:55:02,910
moment.
She popped out of the ocean and her

1254
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,460
shoulder was like separated body surfing
and I was just like,

1255
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,950
you did you get an Mri?
Do you know what's going on?

1256
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,540
Oh yeah.
It was like three years ago.

1257
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:10,990
It was a dislocated.
Yeah,

1258
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,930
right.
But no tearing or anything like that.

1259
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,740
I apparently,
it doesn't feel the same.

1260
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:18,090
Dislocated my shoulder.
I didn't even know weird because I could

1261
00:55:18,091 --> 00:55:21,480
see it physically on her body.
She doesn't have as much muscle as you,

1262
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,720
but I was looking at her arm going like,
I don't know what to do about that.

1263
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:28,260
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I guess I could hoist her on my shoulder

1264
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:30,470
and walk back because it was like there
was a wall.

1265
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:32,063
It just popped back

1266
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:34,600
posted.
Like for some people you're supposed to

1267
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:39,040
like lay them down and stretch their arm
or pull it out and then it'll fall back.

1268
00:55:39,041 --> 00:55:39,310
In.

1269
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,090
The most I know about shoulder
dislocations is from lethal weapon,

1270
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,910
so slam them up against the wall.
Do they throw it into yourself?

1271
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,610
Just have loose shoulders.
Like I know some girls who like every

1272
00:55:51,611 --> 00:55:55,350
time she has sex or like one out of five
times her shoulder becomes dislocate.

1273
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:57,450
I'll be honest,
Joe touched on some of the loosest

1274
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:00,790
shoulders in the game.
Maybe those girls are just like drama

1275
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:01,660
queens.
No,

1276
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,370
no.
Always going like this and they just

1277
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,920
like being hurt.
Whether fucking.

1278
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,150
Can you imagine though how bad that
would be if you were fucking the girl

1279
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:12,000
and her shoulder got dislocated?
Yeah.

1280
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,500
That was really bad or good or some
pads.

1281
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,320
Solar pads.
Some shoulders,

1282
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,550
some football town support.
Yeah.

1283
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,740
I do that anyway just because I like a
more masculine woman,

1284
00:56:20,741 --> 00:56:22,900
so I liked her to be wearing big back
something with a

1285
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:28,690
just like give her a little Tbi.
Traumatic booty injury,

1286
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,300
jail.
It's so easy to go to jail now.

1287
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,750
Yeah.
We should be in jail just for saying

1288
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:37,600
this right
now so we can.

1289
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,310
Aren't you glad to not be dating right
now?

1290
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,290
Oh yeah.
It seems like a nightmare for everybody

1291
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,124
to know.
That is.

1292
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,590
It seems so scary.
If you get lucky and find someone that's

1293
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:45,341
awesome.
It's great.

1294
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:46,960
It's a good time and it's fun and
exciting.

1295
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:49,580
But most of the time,
well,

1296
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:50,650
you know,
I remember,

1297
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,970
you know like now it's like if,
if,

1298
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,090
if a girl wants to,
she can just say that she didn't consent

1299
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:01,290
and you'd probably make them fun forms,
fill out forms,

1300
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:06,160
but you didn't need forums.
I think she'd have a stack of them next

1301
00:57:06,161 --> 00:57:07,390
to the bed just to let chicks.
No,

1302
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:10,240
that's.
This is like really casual.

1303
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,880
Like they do that though.
All these so many forms.

1304
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:15,800
All these big stars do that.
They make you like instagram cruise.

1305
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:18,510
Not like the beat,
there was a story about Justin Bieber

1306
00:57:18,511 --> 00:57:20,640
will make you like videotape yourself
saying like,

1307
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,370
I'm of sound mind and body and I choose
to fuck Justin Bieber,

1308
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,061
you know,
oh,

1309
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:25,350
that makes sense,
or whatever,

1310
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,550
because he's fucking little skanks
allegedly and uh,

1311
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,590
you know,
they're probably trying to get over on

1312
00:57:31,591 --> 00:57:33,450
them.
And I would imagine if you're that

1313
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,700
wealthy,
like you have to worry about everything

1314
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:39,450
you do all the time.
I'm sure there are a lot of guys who are

1315
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,270
probably trying to take advantage of
girls,

1316
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:44,580
so for sure.
Maybe there's more of that.

1317
00:57:44,581 --> 00:57:46,830
Maybe that's on the rise.
So it's bad for you.

1318
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,650
Boy.
I bet it's the same as it's always been.

1319
00:57:49,651 --> 00:57:52,230
There's always been creeps in.
There's always been creeps on both

1320
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:54,230
sides.
This is the thing is that there,

1321
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,370
there's more creeps in the men's side.
Let's get real.

1322
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,040
I mean there's more like there's more

1323
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:03,110
psychos,
maybe more crazy people that you date,

1324
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:07,340
but there's more predators that you as
there are more male predators than there

1325
00:58:07,341 --> 00:58:09,800
are female.
I'm sure there are female partners and

1326
00:58:09,801 --> 00:58:12,650
their cycle men,
but if we were to really do some number

1327
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:13,470
crunching,

1328
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:15,030
you know,
I would imagine it's not even.

1329
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,440
I've never had,
it's 50 slash 50.

1330
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:20,640
I've never had an experience that I was
actively scared and I've had experience

1331
00:58:20,641 --> 00:58:22,170
where I was like,
I'm not spending the night at this

1332
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:24,000
girl's house because I don't know if I'd
wake up

1333
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:28,260
our friend.
This girl emailed him and we left.

1334
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:29,820
Well,
I'm just saying there's two real.

1335
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:33,120
I remember this one girl,
I was at her house

1336
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,280
and I was like,
oh,

1337
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:36,140
I,
this person maybe would kill me in my

1338
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:36,841
sleep.
She was,

1339
00:58:36,841 --> 00:58:37,880
uh,
she was crazy.

1340
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:40,250
She was,
I remember she kept,

1341
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,600
she was like real Hollywood,
like punk trash right when I moved to

1342
00:58:44,601 --> 00:58:45,860
town.
You okay with this story?

1343
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,640
And uh,
she,

1344
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,100
she,
she

1345
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:53,630
kept going.
She kept asking me to put a cigarette

1346
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:57,440
out on her and I was like,
I don't think I can do that and I don't

1347
00:58:57,441 --> 00:58:59,810
think I can do that,
but I would like an ash on her.

1348
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,370
We're like full put.

1349
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,260
And then I remembered that she was,
um,

1350
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,930
she was,
she kept when she was,

1351
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,410
she would go down on me and she kept
like horribly but biting me and my

1352
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:16,930
genitals and she was like biting my
balls,

1353
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:18,490
I remember and I was like,
please stop that.

1354
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,810
Like please,
please know.

1355
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,860
And then all of a sudden we kept

1356
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,450
making out and she looked down and she
looked.

1357
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,860
She was like,
what is that like a,

1358
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,310
the way you say,
uh,

1359
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,370
what is that when somebody is got like
an std,

1360
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,050
right?
You know,

1361
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:29,860
that like,
what,

1362
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:32,060
what is this?
And I looked down and there was a

1363
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:36,530
fucking contusion in my nuts,
like a hiding it from her bite.

1364
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:39,770
She like burst a blood vessel and
there's like a mad about it.

1365
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:45,370
She wouldn't know she had and
she had done it and not,

1366
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:50,560
you'll have a little respect for my
wife's in the room.

1367
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:52,750
So she's sucking my balls.
So Hi

1368
00:59:56,980 --> 00:59:58,960
friend emailed him,

1369
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,140
said,
just so you know,

1370
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:03,860
I know he didn't have sex,
but if we had permission and it would

1371
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:04,190
have been

1372
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:04,790
right,
right.

1373
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:08,510
She goes,
what does our friend who was her friend

1374
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:10,700
was at at Reed College actually were or
not.

1375
01:00:10,701 --> 01:00:11,151
Were you?
Yeah,

1376
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:12,680
so read a read.
Not Evergreen,

1377
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:17,681
but read where it's like the center of
like the woke sort of PCC campus culture

1378
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:20,270
and she extreme.
That's very extreme.

1379
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:24,010
She called him and said she was drunk
and she came onto him and was like,

1380
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,910
his name is Andrew [inaudible].
He's a,

1381
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:26,721
he's A.
Oh,

1382
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:27,940
I shouldn't say that.
Oh,

1383
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:32,030
maybe I shouldn't say that because I
just blatantly telling him he didn't do

1384
01:00:32,031 --> 01:00:32,520
anything.
No,

1385
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,320
no.
He d,

1386
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,580
She came onto him.
Let's not say her name now.

1387
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,850
I don't know who she is,
but he's a comedian and I just figured

1388
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:39,170
he'd want a shout out,
but at any rate,

1389
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:42,210
he's a great comedian.
He,

1390
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:44,450
he definitely avoided the punchline.
So

1391
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:48,060
at any rate,
he,

1392
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:50,420
he didn't hook up with her.
She came onto him and he was like,

1393
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:51,590
okay,
I'm not feeling this.

1394
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,453
No,
thank you.

1395
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,570
Went home,
went to bed,

1396
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,450
a gay guy.
And uh,

1397
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,980
and then she,
she texted him like a week later was

1398
01:00:57,981 --> 01:00:59,180
like,
I just wanted to thank you for not

1399
01:00:59,181 --> 01:01:01,640
taking me home that night because I was
drunk.

1400
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,530
It wouldn't have been consensual.
It would've been raped.

1401
01:01:03,531 --> 01:01:04,540
So thank you.
It's just like,

1402
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,470
well,
that's how a lot of people want to

1403
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:12,200
firmly established that though,
that if you're an adult and you're

1404
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,570
drinking and you have sex,
it's rape.

1405
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,760
Well,
it is hard though because you have to

1406
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:18,650
understand being a woman,
you are so vulnerable.

1407
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:21,290
Like men have more upper body strength.
We do have a whole.

1408
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,060
And they have a thing that goes into the
whole.

1409
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,740
Whoa,
you're saying crazy things right now

1410
01:01:24,741 --> 01:01:26,260
that no one knows.
No,

1411
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,390
but it's like we drop that kind of
knowledge.

1412
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,283
You have to

1413
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,190
yourself.
Imagine yourself if you had a whole

1414
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:34,800
instead and you didn't have those
muscles and you were just walking

1415
01:01:34,801 --> 01:01:35,634
around,
you know,

1416
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:38,900
well,
what is the idea that women or men are

1417
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,790
afraid that women are going to laugh at
them?

1418
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,290
Women are afraid men are going to kill
them.

1419
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,440
Yeah.
Those are both very different things.

1420
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,760
Yeah.
But that's the reality is that just like

1421
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:51,740
when you say there's like the equal
dispensation of predators on the side,

1422
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:52,281
it's like,
well no,

1423
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:53,200
there really aren't.
Right.

1424
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:55,640
That really is.
I said there's creeps in both sides.

1425
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:58,130
Don't necessarily think it was equal.
What I mean is,

1426
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,860
and I'm not trying to.
I wasn't doing that to like I said that,

1427
01:02:00,861 --> 01:02:03,550
but I did probably was flippant.
But my point is that,

1428
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:07,640
that the world that women walk around in
is one where they fear that the worst

1429
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:10,520
case scenario is they're going to be
kidnapped,

1430
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:11,241
raped,
and murdered.

1431
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:14,720
In our worst case scenario is usually is
not that.

1432
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,910
Yeah.
Well exactly the rate part in

1433
01:02:16,911 --> 01:02:18,650
particular.
Most of the time it's not that.

1434
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,280
And if it is,
it's also from a fucking

1435
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,420
man from a dude.
Yeah.

1436
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:24,360
I mean I,
I had an argument with a guy who's a

1437
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,270
men's rights activist about that.
He was like,

1438
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,280
actually more men are raped and women
are stupid.

1439
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,320
They're raped by men.
Fuck.

1440
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:35,310
You're just reinforcing the argument
against men.

1441
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,140
That's like such a dumb argument.
Well,

1442
01:02:37,141 --> 01:02:38,850
they always like,
they haven't even looked into it.

1443
01:02:38,851 --> 01:02:39,860
They like,
they like,

1444
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:43,590
it's such a surface thing to say like,
have you done like the next step?

1445
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:44,820
Like who's raping?
Oh yeah,

1446
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:46,440
guys probably shouldn't bring it up.
Yeah,

1447
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:47,460
you should probably shouldn't bring it
up.

1448
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,320
Do you want her to support men?
If you like.

1449
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:50,820
Your whole thing is that men are
awesome.

1450
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,370
Like men are actually.
The victims were raped more than women.

1451
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:54,263
Right.
By what?

1452
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,550
Goblins.
Let's fucking.

1453
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:56,830
Demons are coming

1454
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:00,450
middle of the night and raping you.
That's a good point by other men.

1455
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:04,290
But this guy was saying it like,
I got you with this fact that I bet you

1456
01:03:04,291 --> 01:03:05,124
did know

1457
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,290
well,
because people like to talk and talking

1458
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:08,180
points.
They don't like to.

1459
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:08,980
I mean

1460
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:11,380
a lot of experience with the alt right
people on your show.

1461
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:13,750
What's that?
Just that they don't think things

1462
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:14,890
through.
Like remember that guy was trying to

1463
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,840
tell you that the people at the woman's
march,

1464
01:03:16,841 --> 01:03:18,250
he's like,
how did they take off their,

1465
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,460
their work and it's like it was on a
Saturday,

1466
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,613
right?

1467
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,970
Did we have this guy on the show?
That was like,

1468
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,190
the problem is it was all out of work.
People that just,

1469
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:30,250
I don't know about.
This was a talking point in the right

1470
01:03:30,251 --> 01:03:32,770
about the women's marches or just about
protests in general.

1471
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:35,830
I don't know how these people are able
to have such privileged that they can

1472
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:37,690
just take work off to go protest.
It's like,

1473
01:03:37,691 --> 01:03:39,790
first of all,
there's a history of protest where

1474
01:03:39,791 --> 01:03:41,920
people strike.
That's the whole idea.

1475
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,440
But second of all,
the women's march in particular was on a

1476
01:03:44,441 --> 01:03:46,890
Saturday,
so it was this guy who is this guy named

1477
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,610
kid named Lucian wind trich.

1478
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,790
Now you were asking who is?
Yeah.

1479
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,430
Good.
All right.

1480
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,320
Brian,
this reason I came to you because we

1481
01:03:55,321 --> 01:03:58,440
were trying to get a.
basically we did the show right?

1482
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,480
And we started with cultural
appropriation.

1483
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:02,590
We ended with the outright with meet the
outright.

1484
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:05,790
Right.
And so we were trying really hard to

1485
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,270
really explore ideas.
Right.

1486
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,590
And I guess if there's,
if there's one thing I realized in the,

1487
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:11,960
in the wake of,
uh,

1488
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:14,850
we definitely triggered the outright
with that cultural appropriation thing.

1489
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:19,620
People were very upset that we even
broached the topic without condemning it

1490
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,220
essentially,
and I think there's.

1491
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,570
There's one thing I realized in the wake
of all of the show is like,

1492
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,910
there's one position I truly don't
respect.

1493
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:28,710
It's,
I disagree with you,

1494
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:31,440
therefore I won't listen to you.
Fuck you.

1495
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:33,000
That's,
that's really.

1496
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,200
There's nothing about that that I have
any respect for.

1497
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:36,190
No,
I completely agree.

1498
01:04:36,191 --> 01:04:40,950
I think I want to know how you came to
that conclusion and oftentimes you could

1499
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:43,810
find if you.
I mean especially if you particularly

1500
01:04:43,811 --> 01:04:47,320
disagree with something someone says and
you thought your side through and you

1501
01:04:47,321 --> 01:04:50,830
talk to someone with an open mind,
you can actually find like the holes in

1502
01:04:50,831 --> 01:04:52,870
their logic and it'll help you
understand.

1503
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,630
Maybe you got some holes in your own
logic,

1504
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,440
not aware of them.
Exactly.

1505
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:01,460
Experiences they're drawing from to help
come up with their way of thinking.

1506
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:01,900
Right?
Yeah,

1507
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:05,260
and I definitely exploring all those
topics found just what you're saying.

1508
01:05:05,261 --> 01:05:09,160
I found like the part of the gun
argument that I really fully wrapped my

1509
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:12,340
brain and my heart around the,
the pro gun second amendment right.

1510
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:15,280
I mean,
I'm still not like a wildly pro gun guy,

1511
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:19,420
but I totally 100 percent this
understanding of where they were coming

1512
01:05:19,421 --> 01:05:21,310
from that I never had before.
That really,

1513
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:23,370
you know,
a lot of the condemnation of the left is

1514
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,270
that they condemn identity politics.
Right?

1515
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,130
And really when it comes to second
amendment,

1516
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:31,300
stuff it.
And also the truth is the outright to.

1517
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:34,690
It's also identity politics is just
identity politics and the reverse.

1518
01:05:34,691 --> 01:05:36,790
It's not like left this identity
politics,

1519
01:05:36,791 --> 01:05:39,910
it's more gun owner identity.
Like in other words,

1520
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,460
when you condemn a gun owner,
you're,

1521
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,560
you,
the liberal thinker is going,

1522
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,150
oh,
I'm condemning guns,

1523
01:05:46,151 --> 01:05:48,610
I'm condemning violence.
And what you don't understand is you're

1524
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:53,020
condemning a person with their hearing
is you're calling them their identity.

1525
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,670
They're the thing that makes them
passionate,

1526
01:05:55,050 --> 01:05:59,230
a illegitimate stupid,
and based in ignorance and violence.

1527
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:01,270
And of course a person's going to react
and go,

1528
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,000
go fuck yourself.
I'll never listened to your argument.

1529
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,510
If you start your argument by basically
telling them their whole lifestyle is

1530
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,344
bullshit.

1531
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,950
Yeah,
there's a real problem with the gun

1532
01:06:10,951 --> 01:06:14,310
ownership argument and one of the big
problems is the mass shootings,

1533
01:06:14,311 --> 01:06:16,950
right?
Everybody condemns mass shootings.

1534
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:18,600
They're horrible.
They're terrifying,

1535
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:21,570
and they only happen with most of the
time people with guns.

1536
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:25,200
I mean we've had some situations
recently in Europe where people driving

1537
01:06:25,201 --> 01:06:28,710
over people with cars and there's a lot
of insane shit that's going on over

1538
01:06:28,711 --> 01:06:31,470
there with that and then people had been
stabbing people in some places,

1539
01:06:31,890 --> 01:06:33,450
but for the most part it's guns.
Right?

1540
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:37,230
But my thought on it is always that it's
a mental health issue.

1541
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,750
There are more guns in this country than
there are people.

1542
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,840
So if you have 300 million guns and
every once a year or so one of these

1543
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:48,240
things happens and you have this mass
shooting this horrible tragedy.

1544
01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:51,270
One of the most constant things,
his mental illness,

1545
01:06:51,271 --> 01:06:55,440
almost all those people are either on
psycho psychoactive medicine.

1546
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,670
Either they're on some sort of anti
psychotic or an antidepressant or the

1547
01:06:59,671 --> 01:07:02,250
coming off of it.
They have a history of psychiatric

1548
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:03,260
treatment,
a history of,

1549
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,280
of illness,
of mental illness.

1550
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,610
It's 100 percent.
It's almost 100 percent of people that

1551
01:07:08,611 --> 01:07:12,960
are like severely mentally ill.
We have horrible standards for mental

1552
01:07:12,961 --> 01:07:16,080
illness in this country for people just
being roaming around the street and a

1553
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:19,160
lot of that came from Reagan when Reagan
let those people.

1554
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,600
Yes.
When they let those people loose,

1555
01:07:21,601 --> 01:07:23,430
that means people need fucking
treatment.

1556
01:07:23,431 --> 01:07:25,410
They need help.
It's a lot of them.

1557
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,730
So a lot of people that are on
dissociatives,

1558
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,360
they're on all these anti psychotic
medication.

1559
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,360
They're fucked up man.
Like they real issues and then they can

1560
01:07:33,361 --> 01:07:34,194
get ahold of guns.

1561
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,380
I agree with you,
but I also think there's a flaw in that

1562
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:41,820
logic because the mass shootings didn't
start commensurate with the shutting

1563
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:45,240
down of the mental health facilities in
California.

1564
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:46,770
When did they.
I,

1565
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,480
they,
they seem to me to be a more.

1566
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,850
I mean,
Kent State obviously was the original.

1567
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:52,910
No,
Kent State was the National Guard.

1568
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:55,100
I'm sorry,
what was the loan in the tower in

1569
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:57,620
Austin,
Texas in 10 states in Ohio.

1570
01:07:57,621 --> 01:07:58,191
Excuse me.
Yeah.

1571
01:07:58,191 --> 01:07:59,750
That,
that was like the first,

1572
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,700
uh,
the first big one.

1573
01:08:01,701 --> 01:08:03,980
But the modern phenomenon of the mass
shooting is,

1574
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,010
it is a fairly modern one.
It feels like the last 20,

1575
01:08:07,011 --> 01:08:07,844
10,
20 years,

1576
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,420
right.
You know that that guy in the tower was

1577
01:08:09,421 --> 01:08:10,254
mentally ill.

1578
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,070
Oh,
I'm not disagreeing with you at all.

1579
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:14,140
That there's.
That mental illness is a huge part of

1580
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:14,974
the pie.

1581
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,080
You're saying the Reagan thing.
I'm not saying the Reagan thing is,

1582
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:20,540
is that 100 percent the reason for it,
but it's a big part of why there are so

1583
01:08:20,541 --> 01:08:23,090
many mentally ill people that were
released in that time.

1584
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,890
I mean,
I can remember when I was a kid because

1585
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:26,450
my dad was talking about it,
he was like,

1586
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:28,340
it's crazy.
There's like so many more homeless

1587
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:30,050
people now.
That's someone and they're talking to

1588
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:31,280
themselves.
They're all fucked up.

1589
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,280
We just abandon these human beings
because their brains aren't working.

1590
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:35,000
Right.
The idea,

1591
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,060
the idea was that Reagan shut down all
the mental health facilities in

1592
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:42,260
California and the idea was that they
would be replaced by community centers

1593
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,110
where each community,
each neighborhood would have like a

1594
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,870
check and send out the check and centers
of course were never built,

1595
01:08:47,871 --> 01:08:49,250
so the people just hit the streets.

1596
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,040
Fornia was.
I thought it was when Reagan was

1597
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,030
president.
I go,

1598
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:54,740
it'd be changed the standards.
National,

1599
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:55,260
national.

1600
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,280
I could be wrong nationally,
right?

1601
01:08:56,370 --> 01:08:57,870
I could be wrong.
It was when he was president.

1602
01:08:57,871 --> 01:09:01,290
I might be wrong.
I saw dark man made the check in.

1603
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,910
They just didn't exist.
I mean,

1604
01:09:02,911 --> 01:09:05,850
what was the only thing I was saying
though was that it's.

1605
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,390
There's something else happening in
America that's like almost feels

1606
01:09:09,391 --> 01:09:13,170
mystical or spiritual with it when it
comes to mass shootings because it's

1607
01:09:13,171 --> 01:09:16,440
like there are other countries with
mentally ill people that have access to

1608
01:09:16,441 --> 01:09:19,190
guns.
That and maybe it's that we,

1609
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:22,920
that we have a less,
a lesser standard of care for mentally

1610
01:09:22,921 --> 01:09:25,740
ill,
but cal Canada also has people babbling

1611
01:09:25,741 --> 01:09:27,720
on the streets.
Although they have limited access to

1612
01:09:27,721 --> 01:09:29,730
guns.
There's something else going on,

1613
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,250
it feels like to me,
and that this is totally anecdotal and

1614
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:34,500
just my opinion,
but feels like to me there's some thing

1615
01:09:34,501 --> 01:09:37,830
that we don't understand that it is of
course mental in this entity that is of

1616
01:09:37,831 --> 01:09:41,550
course access to guns and there's some
third thing that people don't really

1617
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,770
can't put your finger on,
which is like,

1618
01:09:43,771 --> 01:09:46,620
why is this happening here?
Why is it happening so much here?

1619
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:50,030
Well,
it could be related to overpopulation.

1620
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:55,280
He could be related to the sort of
established mindset of the American

1621
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:58,400
people.
Like why are Canadian so much nicer when

1622
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:01,400
they're connected to us?
Like you just like if you look at the

1623
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:03,440
landmass,
there's no real line,

1624
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:05,420
but you go across the culturally.
Yeah,

1625
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:06,740
they're,
they're way nicer.

1626
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,510
They're just nicer,
you know,

1627
01:10:08,511 --> 01:10:10,130
and they're,
they talk like us,

1628
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,860
they look like us,
they pronounce a few words differently

1629
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:14,830
and they're way nicer,
you know,

1630
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,750
and they don't get a lot of mass
shootings up there at super uncommon.

1631
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:19,820
It's interesting.
I mean it's based on this.

1632
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:23,540
I think it's about the connection of
America to its guns is based on.

1633
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,170
It's,
it's,

1634
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:27,470
it's a foundation mythology.
It's religion in a weird way,

1635
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,030
right?
The religion of America,

1636
01:10:29,031 --> 01:10:30,050
the greatest country on earth.

1637
01:10:30,270 --> 01:10:30,901
Well,
it's based.

1638
01:10:30,901 --> 01:10:33,210
It's a lot of.
It's based on fear means it's freedom

1639
01:10:33,211 --> 01:10:37,470
for sure,
but a lot of like the tactical people,

1640
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,900
like the people that are really,
really into what happens if somebody

1641
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:41,030
breaks in and you've got to be ready to
go up,

1642
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:42,500
pulled that gun out on two point two
seconds,

1643
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,301
got to be able to Tink,
tink,

1644
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:44,640
tink,
shoot targets.

1645
01:10:44,641 --> 01:10:48,480
I mean there's people that I know people
are good friends that practice that shit

1646
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:52,370
all the time and if you break into their
house you are fucked because they're

1647
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:55,050
ready and they're looking for it.
They want people to break.

1648
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:57,650
I know people were asking people police
break into my phone.

1649
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:03,210
I took Natasha to shoot guns in
anticipation of this gun episode that we

1650
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,360
did with the it so much I can't say I
love to do.

1651
01:11:06,550 --> 01:11:07,960
I will.
I got there and I thought I'd make a

1652
01:11:07,961 --> 01:11:09,910
joke because you have to pick your
little target.

1653
01:11:09,911 --> 01:11:11,350
So I was like,
are there any trump?

1654
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:14,520
I'm nudging her,
like Natasha,

1655
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:17,180
we are not in the right area.

1656
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,350
We got the Hillary's coming in next
week.

1657
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:21,370
Oh,
real hillary.

1658
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:24,670
That you could shoot me.
I think he was just talking shit to her

1659
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,470
for asking the trucks.
Yeah,

1660
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,520
probably talk with a southern accent.
It was a side of twice

1661
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,110
and then we get in there and there's
people just like doing magazine rifles.

1662
01:11:38,111 --> 01:11:39,610
And then there's a guy going through
saying,

1663
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:40,960
uh,
what was he saying?

1664
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:42,130
Like,
no rapid fire,

1665
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,600
rapid fire because they're just like,
just like these kids.

1666
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,180
It was pretty crazy,
like there weren't even dividers in

1667
01:11:49,181 --> 01:11:50,170
between us.
Oh.

1668
01:11:50,171 --> 01:11:52,150
And then he was telling me how to work
the gun and I was like,

1669
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:54,100
he's like,
make sure that your thumb doesn't go

1670
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:54,521
here.
Okay,

1671
01:11:54,521 --> 01:11:55,420
go ahead.
And I was like,

1672
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:55,781
wait,
wait.

1673
01:11:55,781 --> 01:11:57,130
Where is my thumb?
Not supposed to go,

1674
01:11:57,131 --> 01:11:58,060
can I,
will you please?

1675
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,930
Because I know he didn't know motion had
no either way.

1676
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,960
Go Laugh and pointed me.
Motherfucker was this little little poof

1677
01:12:06,281 --> 01:12:07,300
over here.
Scared too.

1678
01:12:07,301 --> 01:12:09,740
We did a one.
I didn't know I did the.

1679
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,100
We did what we had got like 50 rounds.

1680
01:12:12,150 --> 01:12:12,691
Yeah,
we bought,

1681
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:16,350
we bought two cars.
You have to buy the ammunition in like a

1682
01:12:16,351 --> 01:12:20,250
box you can't buy like all have.
So we bought two boxes thinking we'd be

1683
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:21,630
there for awhile.
The training,

1684
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:24,680
the training session was literally 10
seconds.

1685
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:26,610
Thirty seconds on.
Put your hand here,

1686
01:12:26,611 --> 01:12:27,600
put that there.
Okay.

1687
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:28,470
Here's your gun.
Go shoot.

1688
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:31,290
And people are rapid firing and you're
surrounded by other people that got that

1689
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:32,850
same safety briefing.
Right?

1690
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:33,780
Right.
And,

1691
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:37,300
and there's a celebrity wall,
one celebrity Shiela booth,

1692
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,740
right.
This is not what you want to see.

1693
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,540
That's a weird one too,
right?

1694
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:45,240
That's what I'm saying.
I lied about being there.

1695
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,770
It was a picture of him there.
So I shot the gun and she shot it and

1696
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:52,560
then I shot it again and I'm feeling
like I gotta get Outta here.

1697
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,240
Natasha was like,
I got to get it.

1698
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,260
I just think it was a bad.
I think every gun advocate or strong gun

1699
01:12:58,261 --> 01:13:01,830
person we've talked to since said about
that particular place,

1700
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:06,270
like that's not a place to start.
It's not a cool place to unsafe and so

1701
01:13:06,271 --> 01:13:07,890
we just,
so I think we picked the wrong place.

1702
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,500
At any rate though,
I'm thinking about these two boxes of

1703
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:11,550
ammunition.
I'm like,

1704
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,840
I can't go to the dude upfront because
he'll think I'm like a little bitch,

1705
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:16,470
you know what I mean?
Like,

1706
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,540
I got all this ammo left,
you know what I mean?

1707
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,160
So,
and then she's like,

1708
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:20,941
Natasha,
she's like,

1709
01:13:20,941 --> 01:13:22,320
don't be an idiot.
Let's get outta here.

1710
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:26,260
So
that's how I walk up to the front and I

1711
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,470
swear I sold her out immediately.
I'm just like,

1712
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:29,970
you know,
I'm trying.

1713
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:31,270
I love it here.
You know,

1714
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,990
this is my home baby.
I like how you go black with

1715
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:37,320
southern.

1716
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,370
If you want to do an idiot,
you go black.

1717
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:41,440
The guy.
I'm like,

1718
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,650
I'm like the wife,
you know what I mean?

1719
01:13:42,660 --> 01:13:44,040
The wife is like,
let's get outta here.

1720
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:44,874
You know,
women,

1721
01:13:46,230 --> 01:13:50,130
I want to stay,
I want to stay,

1722
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:53,790
but I can't.
I got to admit I'm not clicking on say

1723
01:13:53,791 --> 01:13:55,590
the wife,
the wife is,

1724
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,110
you know,
I'm all like emotional from having shot

1725
01:13:58,111 --> 01:13:59,250
a gun.
Like I gotta get Outta here,

1726
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:00,880
but really I'm just like,
you know,

1727
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,940
as you well know you want to shoot all
night,

1728
01:14:02,941 --> 01:14:07,110
but the live now I'm going Italian.
First time I ever shot one.

1729
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,010
The first thing I felt when I went into
the,

1730
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:12,100
the area where put the ear plugs

1731
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,980
on and you stand next to these people
and there was these little dividers,

1732
01:14:14,981 --> 01:14:19,000
the place that I went.
But when you hear that you feel so

1733
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,120
vulnerable.
Yeah.

1734
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:21,250
You feel like,
whoa.

1735
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,100
Like if that hits you,
that's a wrap.

1736
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:24,640
They not going to make it.
Yeah,

1737
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:27,280
exactly.
I got to ask you guys this before you

1738
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:29,650
take off.
Just see this trump thing,

1739
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:33,250
the CNN thing,
they're going after the kid who made the

1740
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:35,950
meme heard it wasn't a kid.
Well this is the thing.

1741
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:40,120
Jamille explained the whole thing,
but it was a kid that they went after

1742
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:45,510
who had made a video or made a meme,
but apparently the meme came from a

1743
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:50,860
video and the video was made by someone
else other than this kid and they

1744
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,710
essentially.
They threatened to docs this kid,

1745
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:56,320
they.
They said they reserve the right to

1746
01:14:56,321 --> 01:15:00,760
expose him and I already 15.
I don't know if that's been 100 percent

1747
01:15:00,761 --> 01:15:01,310
proven.

1748
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,290
I don't know if it's been 100 percent
disproven,

1749
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:06,200
but I just heard that that is a lie.
It's a lie.

1750
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:07,340
The 15 year old

1751
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,290
ness of this kid,
well I don't know if that's the case

1752
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:13,260
because he's not actually 15.
It's because now they're talking about a

1753
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:16,500
different person who created the
original video that was turned into you.

1754
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:17,850
Video,
Gif file,

1755
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,230
trump body slamming the.

1756
01:15:20,670 --> 01:15:21,600
No,
they're saying that.

1757
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,020
That's

1758
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,400
so trump.
This is what it is.

1759
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:28,200
Trump was on the wwe and he did a thing
where he slammed to the ground and so

1760
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:30,270
they're gonna.
They took that and put a truck,

1761
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:34,680
a CNN head over the person's body who
trumps slammed to the ground and then

1762
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:35,560
trump tweeted it

1763
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,610
offensive.
Very inappropriate.

1764
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,740
Very non-presidential.
Pretty fucking funny.

1765
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:41,623
I mean I got

1766
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:46,790
nothing compared to him talking about
that woman having plastic surgery and

1767
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:50,380
saying that her face was bleeding badly
from the face lift.

1768
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:54,280
That's just gross.
Like that is something wrong with him.

1769
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,020
That's so beneath anybody.
That's not,

1770
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,670
that's not just beneath the president
that's beneath

1771
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:03,220
it is something deeply wrong with him.
He's getting worse.

1772
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:05,830
He's going off these,
these on tissue right now.

1773
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:10,240
Pressure probably getting mentally ill
at this point because the seventies

1774
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,790
isn't.
Isn't mental illness like your brain

1775
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,530
chemistry changing and can you imagine
what would.

1776
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:17,580
By the way,
when the outright came after me for for

1777
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,410
the show,
I had this other realization which is

1778
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,550
even people you don't respect if enough
people hate you,

1779
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:25,590
it.
It's,

1780
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:30,940
it's gotta affect on your brain and
imagine being Donald Trump where half of

1781
01:16:31,991 --> 01:16:35,790
the world or more is like,
fuck you all day every day.

1782
01:16:35,950 --> 01:16:40,760
Half the world.
Imagine a large number of people in the

1783
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:41,593
Republican America.
Exactly,

1784
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:44,680
but it's way more than half of America
now because there's a large number of

1785
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:47,350
people in the Republican Party that are
criticizing.

1786
01:16:47,351 --> 01:16:47,630
Right.
It

1787
01:16:47,630 --> 01:16:49,580
makes me mad,
is that we called it the women's March

1788
01:16:49,581 --> 01:16:52,640
and that no one really gives it respect
for what it was because it was the

1789
01:16:52,641 --> 01:16:57,500
largest protest protest in the,
in our history of our lives was to an

1790
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,750
anti,
basically an anti trump protest.

1791
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:03,710
Like when that guy was elected and like
we should just be talking about that

1792
01:17:03,711 --> 01:17:07,740
more like that's never happened in our
lifetimes or our parents' lifetimes did

1793
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,840
it.
There was that big of a.

1794
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:13,220
because someone was being elected and it
just kinda gets pushed to the side.

1795
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,070
I mean,
I'm glad it's called the women's march,

1796
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:16,904
but it's just like

1797
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,970
basically that we.
The idea of it was marginalized in the

1798
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:22,490
scope of those marginalized because they
called themselves a woman

1799
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,250
smart maybe.
I don't know because it's such a huge

1800
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,470
deal.
Like I mean it was so exciting to be a

1801
01:17:27,471 --> 01:17:30,620
part of that and you saw those pictures
and they weren't just in every city in

1802
01:17:30,621 --> 01:17:32,930
America.
They were in every city in the world.

1803
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,090
That's how opposed we were.
That didn't happen.

1804
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:37,340
When you know anyone who in our life

1805
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:39,570
times,
it's become kind of a reaction to a

1806
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:42,330
president before.
Never wanted to talk about the CNN.

1807
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,620
What's crazy is that CNN is becoming a
monster to fight a monster.

1808
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,140
Right,
and they're threatening to dox people

1809
01:17:49,141 --> 01:17:52,770
that are making funny memes.
I all that was was funny.

1810
01:17:52,771 --> 01:17:56,850
I mean nobody really thought that Donald
Trump was actually slamming the person

1811
01:17:56,851 --> 01:18:00,650
that is CNN that doesn't even have a
head that has a cnn for head and

1812
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:04,980
feeling.
Some reporter from CNN was going after

1813
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:07,350
the person.
They track the person down on Reddit who

1814
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:08,880
made the means.
Who gives a fuck?

1815
01:18:08,881 --> 01:18:10,410
Who made the memes?
That's what's crazy.

1816
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:13,390
Meme itself isn't offensive.
The name itself is funny.

1817
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,040
The offensive part,
if anything,

1818
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:17,680
is that the president of the United
States thought it was appropriate to

1819
01:18:17,681 --> 01:18:18,290
retweet it.

1820
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:21,170
It's more dumb than it is.
If it did offend me even slightly,

1821
01:18:21,171 --> 01:18:23,180
I saw him that he retweeted.
I was like,

1822
01:18:23,181 --> 01:18:24,650
Huh,
that's my reaction.

1823
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:28,160
Listen,
you are correct in my opinion that the

1824
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:33,280
CNN in particular and the press in
general is as filled with warts,

1825
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,250
not as filled with warts,
but it's filled with warts in the same

1826
01:18:37,251 --> 01:18:38,260
way that the funding

1827
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:43,320
found Dick
joke to make joe that was the right joke

1828
01:18:45,891 --> 01:18:50,891
to make the right time didn't mean it
and you're there at the top there.

1829
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:55,180
We would have such a laugh over this.
We've got to sand them off before I see

1830
01:18:55,181 --> 01:18:59,080
the Mrs Farmer,
but it's not that.

1831
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:04,081
It's this new realm that we're in where
these cable networks are struggling so

1832
01:19:04,151 --> 01:19:08,740
hard to get attention and they're
focusing on really crazy shit.

1833
01:19:08,741 --> 01:19:13,120
Like CNN had a bunch of people fired for
making up fake stories about Russia and

1834
01:19:13,121 --> 01:19:17,470
trump or not substantiating these
stories and making sure they're correct

1835
01:19:17,471 --> 01:19:21,250
before they released it and put it live
and so three people had to resign.

1836
01:19:21,251 --> 01:19:23,410
I think it was three CNNS not
struggling.

1837
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:26,680
That's what they're struggling.
They're down 20 percent and rating.

1838
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:31,820
I thought CNN and MSNBC and some other
left leaning thing,

1839
01:19:32,490 --> 01:19:36,570
although I don't really consider CNN
left leaning is like at the top of the

1840
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,290
charts now

1841
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:39,180
what I read,
and it might be bullshit,

1842
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:39,850
I don't know.
Well,

1843
01:19:39,850 --> 01:19:41,400
let's pull this up.
See if you could find out.

1844
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,370
What I read was that CNN is down 20
percent since June,

1845
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,770
and that Fox is actually up 20 percent.

1846
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:48,990
No,
no.

1847
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:51,060
So lots of splits like typed and CNN
ratings.

1848
01:19:51,061 --> 01:19:55,210
It says chump is way off on cns ratings
being down and trump said,

1849
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:55,741
no,
no,

1850
01:19:55,741 --> 01:19:56,190
no,
I didn't.

1851
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,500
I didn't hear it from trump.
I heard it from someone else was

1852
01:19:58,501 --> 01:20:00,090
probably parroting trump.
I mean,

1853
01:20:00,091 --> 01:20:02,670
we're all that there in lies the
problem.

1854
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:05,520
We're all being wrapped filled with
misinformation from both sides.

1855
01:20:05,970 --> 01:20:06,960
Each side is so

1856
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,660
in their,
in their echo chamber,

1857
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:14,430
but they all accept the left and the
right included all except the

1858
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,490
information that they're getting as
Gospel truth that cannot be assailed by

1859
01:20:17,491 --> 01:20:20,370
the other side's facts.
And so nobody even knows what the truth

1860
01:20:20,371 --> 01:20:22,770
is anymore.
Nobody knows what the argument.

1861
01:20:22,771 --> 01:20:24,450
Even if they read it,
it's true.

1862
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:25,830
Oh,
so Fox News,

1863
01:20:25,831 --> 01:20:27,450
CNN,
MSNBC,

1864
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:31,620
so trump is responsible for everybody
paying attention now driven by surgeons.

1865
01:20:31,621 --> 01:20:33,960
For the Rachel maddow show.
Last word with Lawrence O'donnell.

1866
01:20:33,961 --> 01:20:37,920
I have no idea who that is.
MSNBC is up a whopping 86 percent in

1867
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,210
local view.
Total viewers.

1868
01:20:39,211 --> 01:20:40,044
Wow.
In Primetime.

1869
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,430
That's amazing.
You Watch.

1870
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,930
Do you watch Rachel Maddow?
No,

1871
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,010
she.
I think she's great.

1872
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:45,780
I think she's based.
She's just so good.

1873
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:50,280
Incredibly smart.
Tucker Carlson is a well dressed guy

1874
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:51,114
with a great haircut,

1875
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,130
good vibe.
So you know where he is though,

1876
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,560
but he is.
Is like this odd bridge between

1877
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:57,930
reasonable people in right wing maniacs.
Yep.

1878
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,930
He looked good.
He's a bridge between reasonable people.

1879
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,780
Sure.
Compared to Hannity.

1880
01:21:02,781 --> 01:21:04,750
Sean Hannity.
So much more reasonable than,

1881
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:07,340
than just a dick though.
That's the problem.

1882
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:09,470
He's an.
He's an asshole to the people he

1883
01:21:09,471 --> 01:21:12,710
interviews.
His whole thing is that he bombards them

1884
01:21:12,711 --> 01:21:16,790
with like kind of snide interviewing,
that relentless,

1885
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:18,680
snide interviewing until they make a
mistake,

1886
01:21:18,681 --> 01:21:20,720
deserve it.
Like he brings up several posture is

1887
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,570
people just for.
Because he knows that they're going to

1888
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:24,670
say something stupid.
Deacon mark.

1889
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:25,281
Exactly.
Well,

1890
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:27,850
there's this idea called not picking in
Natasha.

1891
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,360
I'll take an uber and you can stay.
Well I.

1892
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,330
that's totally fine.
I just.

1893
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:34,950
Weird little moment.
Your relationship.

1894
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:39,830
Sorry.
I had the whole day like just by the

1895
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:40,401
hour,
you know,

1896
01:21:40,401 --> 01:21:42,530
and I have to be in Hollywood.
It's,

1897
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,480
it's for.
I get it.

1898
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:47,270
It's something I'm doing like I'm,
it's a voiceover,

1899
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:49,970
but we could,
we could bring this whole Tom Cruise.

1900
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:53,510
Whoa.
It's not Tom Cruise and scientology

1901
01:21:53,511 --> 01:21:54,860
promo film.
I'm sorry.

1902
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:57,560
It's just I have like partners who are
waiting for me and if I don't get their

1903
01:21:57,561 --> 01:22:02,560
writeup for wait a minute for
boring explained.

1904
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:06,260
It's an adr session that I'm hosting a
table from my show,

1905
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,750
another period and it's in Hollywood at
four,

1906
01:22:08,751 --> 01:22:09,890
so I have to go.
I'm sorry.

1907
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:11,360
No worries.
I had a great time.

1908
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,940
I had a great time as well.
I think we learned a lot about each

1909
01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:14,823
other

1910
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,160
for things.
You guys have an awesome tour.

1911
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,140
It's going to take off.
Tell everybody.

1912
01:22:20,141 --> 01:22:22,300
July 19th,
we will be in New Orleans,

1913
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:26,140
Louisiana.
My Dad always says the uninsured.

1914
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:28,120
Then we're going to Atlanta,
Miami,

1915
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,410
Montreal,
Boston,

1916
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:30,550
New York,
Philadelphia,

1917
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:31,690
Chicago,
Milwaukee,

1918
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,160
Minneapolis,
yeah.

1919
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:35,410
We'll be in Brooklyn.
Moshe Kasher.com.

1920
01:22:35,411 --> 01:22:36,700
The [inaudible] dot com.
We'd love to.

1921
01:22:37,930 --> 01:22:40,530
He does a set.
Sometimes we switch the order and then

1922
01:22:40,531 --> 01:22:43,010
at the end we both come out and we'd
been giving people love advice,

1923
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:47,330
live relationship counseling.
It's been really fun and we've helped

1924
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:50,190
some marriages I feel like if you
haven't,

1925
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:53,260
but do you
see.

1926
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:57,250
It's a funny thing to say right there.
Maybe

1927
01:22:57,570 --> 01:22:59,470
if you.
Did he give them a microphone and they

1928
01:22:59,471 --> 01:23:01,570
asked questions to you?
What would they come up on stage?

1929
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:06,220
We basically they have.
Some of them have one time.

1930
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,470
We've helped some people in the most
minor ways.

1931
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:12,400
Like somebody like the cat likes to
sleep on the on the bed and we go,

1932
01:23:12,401 --> 01:23:14,200
well,
why don't you once a week put a blanket

1933
01:23:14,201 --> 01:23:15,070
down,
let the cat slate.

1934
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:16,720
One guy was like,
well,

1935
01:23:16,721 --> 01:23:20,380
I think we have problems because I
wasn't touched by my parents at any

1936
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:22,720
point until I was nine years old and we
were like,

1937
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,070
not qualified.
Say I would love to stay here and talk

1938
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:30,530
all day,
or at least for another hour listening.

1939
01:23:30,531 --> 01:23:35,300
We can do it another solo podcast after
we leave for another 45 minutes will be

1940
01:23:35,301 --> 01:23:36,860
fine.
There's plenty of entertainment out

1941
01:23:36,861 --> 01:23:38,120
there for these folks.
Oh,

1942
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:40,010
you want me to stay?
Whatever you want,

1943
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:42,740
but I got to call the uber now.
Then we can wrap it up.

1944
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:44,310
I think you should take whatever you
want.

1945
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,060
So we'll wrap this up.
Let's wrap this up.

1946
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:52,460
Ladies and gentlemen.
Have you ever had a more awkward ending

1947
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:53,660
to a podcast?
It was perfect.

1948
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:54,460
I love it.
Awkward.

1949
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:55,700
It wasn't awkward at all.
She's angry.

1950
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,400
Conversation in the car.
You guys should.

1951
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:03,140
You should do like,
this is going to be a good stream.

1952
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:05,900
You can tell a lot about a man,
how he does an impression of women,

1953
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:12,000
I mean accurate,
mimic,

1954
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:15,440
and then dice always make them like,
no.

1955
01:24:15,441 --> 01:24:18,010
He's like,
can I please?

1956
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:24,530
And then other guys always make them
seem like gay.

1957
01:24:24,531 --> 01:24:25,450
Like,
Oh,

1958
01:24:25,730 --> 01:24:28,160
where's
Tasha?

1959
01:24:28,161 --> 01:24:31,370
I'm not making fun of all women.
I'm just making fun of you.

1960
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:37,270
Oh my God.
My impression of women yourself.

1961
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,770
I hate sports.
My impression of women goes like this.

1962
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,360
Hi,
I'm Alonzo Bowden,

1963
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:45,500
exercise size with three fingers.
All Right,

1964
01:24:45,501 --> 01:24:47,700
ladies and gentlemen,
we wrap this up by.

1965
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,080
Thank you guys.
Thank you for having a pleasure.

1966
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:50,820
Thank you.
