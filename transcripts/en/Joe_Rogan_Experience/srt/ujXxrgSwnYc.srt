1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,420
Boom.
We're alive.

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,313
Fresh from the trenches.
Joe Schilling in the motherfucking 

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,820
house.
It's up.

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:09,690
Joe.
How are you brother?

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,710
I'm doing,
I'm doing pretty well.

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:13,500
He chatting with people.
Are you doing let snapchat then the kids

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,530
had a snapchat you to the world,
these wacky kids and their snapchat.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,890
I tried snapchat the other day cause my 
little daughter loves it.

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,570
God Damn,
Dude.

10
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:24,540
All my names are taken.
My name's taken powerful.

11
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,570
Jrs taken Joe Rogan experience has taken
everything.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,550
He's fucking creeps.
That's so weird.

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,530
Give it up.
You freaks.

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,820
Give my name back where those,
yeah.

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,070
Well we gotta do,
I was late to the game.

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,360
What is the big deal with snapchat?
Why is everybody like that?

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,373
Uh,
I don't know.

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,900
That's a,
it's really blown up lately.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,880
When it first came out years ago,
it was like,

20
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,010
I had a little different connotation to 
it.

21
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,561
It was like,
you know,

22
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,190
the pictures deleted in like five 
seconds.

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,010
It was like,
you're sexting APP.

24
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,670
Yeah.
Fucking Dick Pics and shit.

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,100
Yeah.
But uh,

26
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,010
but nobody deletes those.
They just make a screenshot.

27
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,490
Yeah.
They,

28
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,211
it'll tell you,
hey,

29
00:00:58,211 --> 00:01:00,300
he's just screenshot to dude.
You're a stuff.

30
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,460
They're like,
no,

31
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,600
that's that horrible feeling in the 
bottom of your gut.

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,670
No,
I don't know.

33
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,440
You've got problems with your sending 
Dick pics anyway.

34
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,850
Understand the less the girl wants dead 
pecs and then you've got to send them,

35
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,460
I guess.
Yeah.

36
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,853
I don't know.
If you talk to people that are in the 

37
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,204
Dick pic game,
that's how you got to send pictures to 

38
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,130
get pictures.
Uh,

39
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,140
cause girls feel vulnerable.
If they're just telling you,

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,033
sending you pictures,
they're posting and you're not sending 

41
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,760
anything back.
They feel like this mother fucker has me

42
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,170
here.
This is bullshit.

43
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,260
There's no trust in this relationship.
Even if they don't want them,

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
they just want a picture.

45
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,583
You know,
sometimes you gotta be vulnerable for 

46
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,140
these girls,
allegedly.

47
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,610
One of my next part,
this is where we're starting Dick pics.

48
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,133
What was it?
There's no rhyme or reason to any of 

49
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:49,380
these damn damn thing,
you know?

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,390
So,
uh,

51
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,223
like I said,
definitely Joe Rogan's Dick pic game is 

52
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:55,650
very strong.
It's still is shaky.

53
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,720
It's all over the road.
But my fucking phone,

54
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,330
I give my phone to my six year old.
It's filled with snapchat,

55
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,820
pictures of her face,
switching in with Kimbo slices,

56
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,690
face all the pictures I have on my 
phone.

57
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,793
She goes through all my photos and finds
pictures that she wants us swap faces 

58
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:19,821
with kids,
these wacky kids these days.

59
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,050
So,
uh,

60
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,831
like I said,
man,

61
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,300
fresh out of the trenches,
man.

62
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,980
You A,
you had a crazy war.

63
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,323
No.
Yeah,

64
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,310
this weekend.
That was wild.

65
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:29,871
Yeah,
man,

66
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:33,260
that was a,
that was something wasn't it?

67
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,340
It was fucking something,
something that was for sure.

68
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,000
Like we were saying before the podcast 
started you,

69
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,770
you were really fighting emotional.
You were,

70
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,330
you were worked up,
you know,

71
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,370
you'd already fought him before and you 
know,

72
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,020
you wanted to get back at him.
And it was,

73
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,150
uh,
it was kind of obvious in a way.

74
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,110
You were fighting.
You were,

75
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,270
you were really putting a lot of 
pressure on him.

76
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,343
Yeah.
I didn't really feel that way at the 

77
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:54,930
time.
They said I wasn't aware of it.

78
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,150
You know what I mean?
I was just in there doing me and uh,

79
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,770
yeah,
there's a lot of pressure,

80
00:02:58,771 --> 00:02:59,530
a lot of,
you know,

81
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,363
it was,
um,

82
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,390
yeah,
I'm wondering,

83
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,670
I wanted to,
I want to knock them out.

84
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,020
I want to do,
I set things right.

85
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,973
I think,
uh,

86
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,720
being the,
uh,

87
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,533
told and,
and kind of carried as the face of a 

88
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,703
belts or kickboxing and there's a lot of
pressure on my shoulders at night and a 

89
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,101
lot of,
uh,

90
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:15,640
you know,
one of,

91
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,473
one of the big shot and I wanted to make
an exciting fight and I think I did 

92
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,114
that,
you know,

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,360
definitely did that kill or be killed 
like you know,

94
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,840
and for Spike TV's perspective,
I'm sure we killed it on the ratings.

95
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,870
And my job was to carry the ratings 
because I was white.

96
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:29,770
I was the first fight from the,
uh,

97
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,820
the main card and uh,
he said it was a never a boring moment,

98
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,190
you know,

99
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,500
it wasn't boring.
It was fucking wild.

100
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,360
Um,
is that,

101
00:03:38,361 --> 00:03:40,580
does that,
that's a weird like fine line.

102
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,650
You have to cross some sometimes between
like,

103
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,833
which I should ask you when,
how do you make the distinction of 

104
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:51,290
whether or not you should fight smart or
fight exciting?

105
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,630
Do you make that distinction or do you 
just go,

106
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,040
can't stop crazy and fucking charge at 
it?

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,690
I mean,
yeah,

108
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,523
I,
uh,

109
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,590
I guess there was like a tournament in 
other,

110
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:02,700
it'd be more,
more,

111
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,060
uh,
pressure to,

112
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,880
to fight a little smarter or whatever.
But,

113
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:06,980
you know,
I,

114
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,910
I take pride in the way that I fight and
I'm,

115
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,110
I think that,
uh,

116
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:13,590
when you turn on a fight,
you want to see a guy like me.

117
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,900
You know what I mean?
Guys that complain about,

118
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:16,651
uh,
you know,

119
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:19,440
people that make boring fights and score
points,

120
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:20,530
floyd mayweather.
You know what I mean?

121
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,750
I want to see the,
uh,

122
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,220
I want to see somebody.
If I like me,

123
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,054
I want to see a worrier.
Go out there and put it all on one line 

124
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,700
and go out on the shield.

125
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,881
Yeah.
That's,

126
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:28,714
uh,
that's something that promoters always 

127
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:31,654
hope that a guy fights like that.
They always hope that a guy goes out 

128
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:38,320
there charging out guns blazing,
you know?

129
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,180
But most people don't.
Yeah.

130
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,103
Well I mean

131
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,280
hindsight,
it didn't work out that all of a sudden.

132
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,250
But uh,
you know,

133
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,520
it has worked out in the past a lot more
often than that.

134
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,380
You know,
there's a lot of people on the Internet.

135
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,420
Oh,
fucking Internet these days right now.

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,950
Vertel you didn't get online after the 
fight.

137
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:57,230
Did you try to stay off for awhile?
It's just a,

138
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,740
it's hard to stay offline too,
so it's a little hard to see if,

139
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,510
uh,
is there anything I could get out of it?

140
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,663
Nope.
Well you could get a lot of technique 

141
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,950
advice from keyboard warriors.
I'm sure they have some,

142
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:11,720
a strategy advice for you.

143
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,980
Yeah.
Everybody has everybody.

144
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,300
Uh,
everybody is an expert,

145
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,223
you know?

146
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,340
Yeah,
everybody's an expert.

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,220
But you know,
that's just the thing.

148
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,210
It's one of those things where people 
don't really earn their opinion or their

149
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,280
right to express her opinion.
Everybody just has one.

150
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:30,970
Now they have an avenue to express.
So you have to separate,

151
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,740
what does that expression,
the wheat from the shaft?

152
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,603
Is that what it is?
I've never figured out what the fuck 

153
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:35,374
chef is.

154
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,740
Hmm.
You know what that is?

155
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:40,940
I talked to Vinnie the day after the 
shoreman vinny shoreman and uh,

156
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,650
he had ever made a really good point 
about it.

157
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:43,160
I was like,
God,

158
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
these fucking guys online,
like,

159
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,940
he's like,
it's easy to say like ignore him.

160
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:47,980
It's easy to say,
you know that,

161
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,943
sorry,
some jerk off kid in their parents' 

162
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:54,230
basement.
But I'm not personally religious,

163
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:55,910
but you know,
he used it as an example.

164
00:05:55,911 --> 00:05:57,240
He's like,
you know,

165
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100
Jesus Christ was

166
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,330
like the greatest person ever.
Right?

167
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,740
Like the greatest,
you know,

168
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,590
water into wine,
heal the sick,

169
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:05,120
give mine all that shit.
The people still killed him,

170
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,821
you know,
make,

171
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:07,370
it doesn't matter how good you are,
what you do,

172
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:09,950
there's always going to be some fucking 
asshole who talk shit and does,

173
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,813
you know what I mean?
And that was a interesting little 

174
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:13,430
perspective that seemed to work out for 
me.

175
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,630
Like,
who cares what these people think?

176
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:16,340
It doesn't matter what you do,
they're going to fucking hate you.

177
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,210
If everyone was perfect,
he wouldn't appreciate perfect people.

178
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,763
If everybody was awesome and really cool
and easy to talk to and friendly and 

179
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,330
like you wouldn't,
it's not going to happen.

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,550
It's too hard.
It's too hard to have your shit together

181
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,430
and there's too many variables that have
to happen in your childhood.

182
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:35,720
I think.
You know,

183
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,810
like everything either has to go really 
good or really bad.

184
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,793
What you appreciate,
things that are really good so you'd 

185
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:43,010
gravitate towards that.
It's one or the other,

186
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,440
but it's just human beings.
Just a project with no directions.

187
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,633
It's like we're a super complicated 
computer and no one has a fucking 

188
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,180
guidebook.
No one knows exactly how to work it.

189
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,530
No one knows exactly what's the end.
Everything's happening in real time.

190
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,723
And the words you say they,
especially when you say something 

191
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:04,424
online,
like you might just be in a crazy mood 

192
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,130
and you know,
you might just,

193
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:08,690
uh,
you just tweet at Jamie,

194
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:10,160
Hey Jamie,
how about you go fuck yourself.

195
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:10,994
You fucking piece of shit for no reason.
You might just want to get a reaction 

196
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,470
that please don't do that to Jamie 
folks.

197
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,230
But you know,
people do stuff like that and they don't

198
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,700
even know why they're doing it.
They just,

199
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,773
they're doing it to get a reaction or 
they doing it because they're upset and 

200
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,760
they're like,
why is this fucking Joe Schilling guy on

201
00:07:28,761 --> 00:07:30,620
tv,
this piece of shit?

202
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,090
Fuck you.
Excuse us.

203
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,560
Miserable people.
But if they met you,

204
00:07:33,561 --> 00:07:34,490
they'd be like,
hey man,

205
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,600
a big fan of sure.
Uber for sure.

206
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,010
They call you fight your real voice.
I'll get like a message.

207
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:43,940
Like I said,
I was,

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,833
I was in a bad mood.
I said something really bad about you a 

209
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,260
couple of months ago online.
I'm really sorry.

210
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,460
Can you unblock me now?
I'm like,

211
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,750
no,
you're a fucking asshole.

212
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,280
Yeah,
real fucking asshole.

213
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,143
You live by the sword,
die by the sword kids and said if you 

214
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:56,630
get blocked,
he stay blocked.

215
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,750
Zero tolerance policy.
Zero tolerance.

216
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,640
Got to be a real piece of shit to get 
blocked.

217
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:04,250
And even if you're a real piece of shit,
one day you might snap out of it,

218
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,930
but you're going to have to change your 
twitter name.

219
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,680
You'd have to start fresh.
Yeah,

220
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,360
it's a new,
you think about it that way.

221
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,250
You're a neutral.
But I think you know,

222
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,590
if someone is upset at you because they 
don't like,

223
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:16,424
you know,
a painting that you did or they don't 

224
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,090
like a song that you made,
that's one thing.

225
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,253
But a fight is so emotional and so 
personal and it's so the consequences 

226
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,403
are,
it's so much different than any other 

227
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,500
endeavor.
Even if you lose a game,

228
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,100
Lebron James,
you fucking suck.

229
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,370
There's two.
It's just the game.

230
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,170
The ball didn't go in the net.
Who gives a fuck?

231
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,090
You know,
in a fight it's salt.

232
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,410
It's the highest consequences possible.
It's,

233
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,330
there's no higher consequences other 
than war.

234
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,553
There's no higher consequences as far as
like how it feels to lose or what it 

235
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,650
feels like to,
to hear people talk shit about you,

236
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,450
about your performance.
It's just that,

237
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,110
and that's one of the reasons why they 
do it.

238
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,190
Like they know.

239
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,950
I know it sucks.
And they know it's not them.

240
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,480
I have a theory about that,
man.

241
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,000
I think one of the reasons why people 
attack people,

242
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,460
like when,
when something goes wrong in their life,

243
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,580
like a charlie sheen thing or something 
like that is that they,

244
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,800
they know that that could happen to 
them,

245
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,300
but it's not happening to them right 
now.

246
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,830
So they feel like,
well fuck him,

247
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,360
then go after him.
You know,

248
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,540
they have this,
they,

249
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,383
this vault,
they understand that they would be 

250
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:23,460
equally vulnerable and they feel that 
that little opening and they just dead.

251
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,140
It can't help it.
It's like a fucking scab.

252
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:26,520
They count,
they want to pick at it.

253
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,423
Eh,

254
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,080
that's interesting.
I just think they're just pieces of shit

255
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,300
that to me just do this a fucking piece 
of shit.

256
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,700
And they're just haters.
Like you're just,

257
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,590
you've never done anything with your 
life.

258
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,870
You know,
you're not willing to take those risks.

259
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,763
And then when you see somebody else 
taking those risks and then it doesn't 

260
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,360
work out,
they're like,

261
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,280
oh,
fucking told you.

262
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:44,840
So,
you know,

263
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,673
they just,
did you ever send people and they're 

264
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,050
just sad and miserable people?
Definitely,

265
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,940
yeah.
This death thing,

266
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,240
that's definitely true.
Did you ever see that Hbo a,

267
00:09:54,241 --> 00:09:55,074
was it 24,
seven with floyd mayweather while he's 

268
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,940
eating a cheeseburger with friend and 
some guy,

269
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,023
uh,
some fucking fat doughy cunt is a 

270
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:05,484
yelling at him.
How he's afraid to fight Manny Pacquiao 

271
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,500
like you're talking to arguably the best
boxer that's ever lived,

272
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,390
ever.
Pretty.

273
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
Pretty arguable.
They pretty,

274
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,680
pretty good argument.
49 and oh,

275
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,920
but really it's only been rocked maybe 
twice in his whole fucking career.

276
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:27,540
You might think of styles boring,
but the fucking guy has done it.

277
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,890
I mean he just did it and he's talking 
to some dough,

278
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,980
a shithead,
some flapping jod dumb cunt who's giving

279
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:38,220
him a hard time about fighting manny 
Pacquiao,

280
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,800
who he then went and shut out a couple 
months later.

281
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,663
Yeah,
but it's those people that aren't doing 

282
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:45,204
anything,
those are the ones that are going to 

283
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,780
yell something like that out.
Those people that they,

284
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,213
they don't,
they don't have anything to gain or to 

285
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:52,464
lose.

286
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,533
And like I bought the mini Petco,
take a box of paper view of that same 

287
00:10:56,451 --> 00:11:00,050
fat daily piece of Shabba bought the 
paper view and as a flood mayweather fan

288
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:04,160
and probably about the tmt tee shirt and
hat and rocks is tap out fucking shit.

289
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,360
You know,
same guy.

290
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,313
Yeah,
he probably has it on a loop on 

291
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,841
facebook.
Him,

292
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,660
he tells everybody.
Did you see that 24 seven I was on,

293
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,400
did you see that Shit fucking called 
them all?

294
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,320
Yo,
I called him out fucking let me.

295
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:18,020
Well Floyd would slap him in the mouth 
to make them drink as pes.

296
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,381
Yeah.
Wait,

297
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,780
now we just gave him another moment.
Hello off.

298
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,321
Off.
There you go.

299
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,440
It's not going to listen to your 
attention buddy.

300
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,440
Have Internet connection.
He doesn't pay his bill.

301
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,500
But I think that that's just,
you know,

302
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:32,660
there's this,
this broad range of people.

303
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,703
There's going to be winners and it's 
going to be losers and there's going to 

304
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:35,774
be people to take risks is going to be 
people that don't ever take risks and 

305
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:40,970
they just,
they live their life.

306
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:45,680
This sad,
muted except experience with no risks,

307
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,520
no fun and no rewards.
They just never,

308
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,920
they never get to shine,
you know,

309
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,113
and a guy like,
I mean you fucking take some big ask 

310
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,430
risks with your life and you have some 
big shining moments,

311
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,480
you know,
like the,

312
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:04,390
the fourth round Kale of Simon Marcus,
you know,

313
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,240
like you don't get those moments and 
less,

314
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,450
sometimes those moments are turned on 
you.

315
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,980
It's just,
there's no other way.

316
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,690
Like the way you do it.
There's no other way.

317
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,800
I mean,
sometimes you're the hammer,

318
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,150
sometimes you're the nail.

319
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:20,790
I am proud as hell of,
you know what I mean?

320
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,624
Like having this conversation like two 
or three days ago of it wouldn't been a 

321
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:25,524
little rough conversation,
but now I'm like looking at it like I'm 

322
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:29,304
going to be remembered as that guy that 
always brought it up and you're not 

323
00:12:30,841 --> 00:12:33,090
going to on my name is going to go down 
when I'm dead and gone.

324
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:35,680
They're going to remember what I've done
for the sport of kickboxing and I didn't

325
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,523
take a lot of pride in that.
And when you turn on the Joe Schilling 

326
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:39,180
fight,
kill or be killed,

327
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:40,014
like I'm,
I'm going to fucking try and knock his 

328
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:42,264
head off and I'm going to get caught 
again in the future and I'm going to 

329
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:47,010
have some huge fucking ups and I'm okay 
with that.

330
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,990
And uh,
you know,

331
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,853
I've been knocked out three times.
I wasn't knocked out cold in this fight 

332
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,330
and it was unconscious.
Even for a second.

333
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:56,490
They just stopped the fight.
I've been knocked out three times.

334
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,324
The number 95 fights.
I've done more than I ever dreamed I 

335
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:01,620
would in the sport.
That's a lot of fucking fight.

336
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:04,410
And my kids are super proud of their 
dad's a superhero.

337
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,990
My mom is super proud.
Those what I've done.

338
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,970
Um,
I'm okay with that.

339
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,443
That's a great attitude.
And if you have that attitude and you 

340
00:13:12,971 --> 00:13:14,890
know,
you press forward with that attitude,

341
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,290
you know,
I know that you don't like losing,

342
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,153
but if you can deal with it,
it makes all the other stuff so much 

343
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,420
easier because you can get right back on
the horse,

344
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,830
you know,
and you've done that already.

345
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,110
You have the experience of getting back 
on the horse.

346
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,570
I mean,
I got hit by a shot and got drops in the

347
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:30,321
fight,
got stopped.

348
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,520
I've had knee surgeries arose out for a 
year and had to come back from it.

349
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,610
And I've had a,
you know,

350
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,593
really,
really hard things to overcome and I 

351
00:13:36,831 --> 00:13:37,664
don't plan on,
I'm not a good loser and I don't play 

352
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:40,850
them on ever becoming a good one.
You know,

353
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,650
you show me a good loser,
I'll show you a loser.

354
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,690
Now the,
the fight,

355
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,260
I mean he,
he hit you with a,

356
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,530
a beautiful spinning back fist,
but it's not,

357
00:13:48,531 --> 00:13:50,840
it wasn't necessarily like legal,
right,

358
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:54,680
because he hit you with a forearm.
Like what does it Bella to our rules.

359
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:57,040
You can't throw elbows,
you can't throw forums is,

360
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,053
that's,
isn't that kind of weird because you 

361
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:01,070
could fucking Shin kick someone in the 
head.

362
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,021
Yeah.
Well,

363
00:14:02,021 --> 00:14:04,590
I think it's,
it's uh,

364
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,553
I s k rule is the,
was the ruling body that does the for 

365
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,800
both blower glory and for a belter and 
the rules,

366
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:13,380
meaning that talk about,
you know,

367
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,730
you can,
you can clinch and knee,

368
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:16,564
but it has to be active.
And if you are active and you were 

369
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:19,570
effective in the let it go for five 
seconds.

370
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,090
If you're holding it all,
if you're just clenching to hold,

371
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,680
they want to be the five seconds,
they'll break it.

372
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,720
It's one of the rules they explained.
Uh,

373
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,970
you know,
when you throw spending back fist,

374
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,730
it has to be the glove.
They hit you or they stick,

375
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,420
they start taking a point where you 
start warning cause it's a illegal shot.

376
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,190
Now I was a professional muy Thai 
fighter of elbows and everything else.

377
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:40,750
So I'm never gonna say that,
you know.

378
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,703
Um,
did he plan on throwing that spinning 

379
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:45,160
back fists?
I don't think so.

380
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,300
Did he have a fucking clue where he was 
when he threw it?

381
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:48,880
And I'm not really,
I'm pretty sure it was rock.

382
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,170
There was no fucking fucking threw it 
and hit me with it.

383
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,280
And you know that shit happens.

384
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,100
But is it,
was that technically illegal shot?

385
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,963
No,
but you know I'm not going to get 

386
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:57,650
tested.
Yeah.

387
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,990
It's,
it kind of should be illegal though,

388
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:00,824
right?
I mean don't you think if you can hit 

389
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:03,254
someone with your Shin,
you should be able to hit someone with 

390
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:04,850
your forearm.
I mean,

391
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:06,710
I don't like these.
I agree with that.

392
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,300
Yeah.
I don't like these rules.

393
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:09,480
I don't,
I think they,

394
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,353
they came up with these rules for k one 
k one had this idea like used to be no 

395
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:14,534
back spinning back fist.
If you watched the old kid one fights 

396
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,100
one the only rule they like say come out
and touch clothes,

397
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,550
come out and swinging or whatever.
And I was like no,

398
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,470
spinning back fist.
That's so crazy.

399
00:15:21,471 --> 00:15:24,170
Cause he always from spinning backwards 
but we could throw a wheel kicks.

400
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,960
Yeah.
That doesn't make any cat.

401
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,813
You know the rule set is I believe 
designed for a certain style of fighter 

402
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,330
or entertainment.
Same thing with the clinch.

403
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,860
Yeah.
So that's the,

404
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,500
those are the rules that they want.
Yeah.

405
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:37,334
They're not big on elbows in Japan 
because pride didn't allow elbows 

406
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:41,930
either,
which is crazy cause they allowed stomps

407
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:45,140
and soccer kicks but they didn't allow 
elbows on the ground.

408
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,783
So k one came up with that rule set.
And the idea behind it I guess was to 

409
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:50,774
make the fights more entertaining 
because you wouldn't be able to clinch 

410
00:15:52,821 --> 00:15:55,910
and you would have to,
you'd be forced to fight it out,

411
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,980
right?
Yeah,

412
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,853
exactly.
What came did was pretty God damn 

413
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:03,050
amazing.
I mean they really took this sport that,

414
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,630
and I think you know Dana white had a 
really good point.

415
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,350
We were talking about this once when I 
was trying to get him to buy k one and I

416
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,184
was like look man,
these guys they're going under like he 

417
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:15,980
got like kickboxing,
like this high level kickbox and whether

418
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:19,430
its glory or it's showtime or any of 
these big organizations.

419
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,730
When you look at the like the high level
talent and kickboxing,

420
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,920
that to me is some of the most exciting 
shit to watch and all combat sports.

421
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,240
When I watch a fight,
like,

422
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,223
like your fight this past weekend or 
like you're the tournament or the Simon 

423
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,740
Marcus fight or you fight with 
[inaudible].

424
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:41,050
These are crazy chaotic fights.
I mean that's what people love,

425
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,270
I think potentially the most about mma.
Obviously,

426
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,493
you know,
I'm a big fan of Jujitsu as well and I 

427
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,750
love when fights go to the ground and I 
love when guys win by submission.

428
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:51,584
But man,
I mean you want to talk about just pure 

429
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:54,584
excitement.
Kickboxing is one of the most exciting 

430
00:16:56,421 --> 00:17:00,320
sports on the planet.
But Dana White's point was it got fucked

431
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:01,154
in America by that Goddamn PKA karate 
that used to be on espn where you would 

432
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,374
watch these guys throw these bullshit 
ass fake kicks where they had to get in 

433
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:12,050
like x amount of kicks per round.

434
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,883
So they would like throw these flippy 
fake stupid kicks and then they would 

435
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,900
have just really shitty sloppy boxing 
and oh man,

436
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,840
there's some really good fucking boxers 
though.

437
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,703
There was,
I think the reason they like it started 

438
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:23,530
from like,
uh,

439
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,210
he was like,
what the seventies eighties.

440
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,063
It was when you were martial arts was 
like the thing is Kung Fu Billy Jack 

441
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:31,761
and,
and Shit,

442
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,500
you know.
Well they had some Rick Rufus,

443
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,250
rufus was a bad motherfucker.
Alex lessio was yeah.

444
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,250
Fucker.
Oh yeah.

445
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,260
Um,
there was some,

446
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:41,440
you know Don the Dragon Wilson was a bad
motherfucker.

447
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,980
Yeah.
But so they had these,

448
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,473
there's karate guys and there are other 
martial arts guys general and they're 

449
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,950
building this,
trying to make this is full thing.

450
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
And there was all these boxes that were 
going there and just beating the fuck 

451
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:54,151
out of everybody's,
they're like,

452
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:54,781
okay,
okay.

453
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:57,330
Okay.
You have to throw seven kicks before you

454
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,250
can feel you have to throw seven kicks 
per round.

455
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,083
Just even keep it from turning into just
straight boxing matches and you watch 

456
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:04,920
them in,
they'll go out there and the big one,

457
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:05,521
two,
three,

458
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:06,151
four,
five,

459
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:06,840
six,
seven.

460
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,470
Why,
why,

461
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,390
why?
I mean they're bad mother fucking boxes.

462
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:11,560
So like there was some really good,
um,

463
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,500
uh,
some really good guys.

464
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,730
There were some really good guys back 
then.

465
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,670
It did go overseas and competed,
you know,

466
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,470
worldwide.
Yeah.

467
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,450
There was somebody,
yeah.

468
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,800
But there was also a lot of like sloppy 
shit.

469
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,180
Oh,
it was a lot of sloppy shit too.

470
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,043
But if you look at the level that you're
seeing now today in high level 

471
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:30,630
kickboxing in comparison to them,
like the Nikki holds skins and a,

472
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:31,464
you know,
Joel Valine Fellini and the Raymond 

473
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,330
Daniels and you,
and it's no,

474
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,050
no comparison.
The level is so high today.

475
00:18:37,051 --> 00:18:40,410
It's much higher today and I feel like 
the public,

476
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,110
it's just for whatever reason,
they haven't tuned into it yet.

477
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,700
To me it's like the most exciting thing 
that most people don't know about.

478
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,890
I mean,
did you watch the might might've been,

479
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,200
yeah,
I did like that.

480
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,260
I thought that that was an interesting 
way to do it.

481
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,380
Have a cage in a ring right by each 
other.

482
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,271
Yeah,
the,

483
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:58,590
the set up of the ring in the cages.
You know,

484
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,513
coker really likes it be for the fans 
that are there that they can watch both 

485
00:19:02,251 --> 00:19:03,150
at the same time.
You know,

486
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,210
I think the seating arrangements get 
weird or not,

487
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,113
but from a marketing perspective,
to get what exactly we were talking 

488
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:09,924
about America,
to pay attention to kickboxing so that 

489
00:19:11,731 --> 00:19:12,564
we can build this sport.
You got all these people that tuned in 

490
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:16,050
to watch rampage.
Yeah.

491
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,943
Matriarchs for his fight.
You got people that weren't wanting to 

492
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,004
watch the,
uh,

493
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,630
the title fight that was going on.

494
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,240
All of those in [inaudible],
Michael Chandler,

495
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,560
Chandler's fight.
Awesome.

496
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,780
Oh man,
dude,

497
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,690
he looked Felix smoking.
Um,

498
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,903
all of those people that tuned in,
Bella terra showed high level 

499
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:33,360
kickboxing.
You know what I mean?

500
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:34,550
Like that's,
that's a,

501
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,870
a genius way to market it and to get it 
out there.

502
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,733
And then,
um,

503
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,500
you know,
I was the first flight on the kickboxing

504
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:44,400
cards to try to keep those fans,
those ratings going or whatnot.

505
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,293
And your boy,
Kevin Ross look sensational to great 

506
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,953
look.
Fucking great.

507
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,770
Yeah,
it's a,

508
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,693
it's Kerri Melendez.
Carrie mullins has fight was fucking 

509
00:19:52,051 --> 00:19:53,070
awesome.
Absolutely.

510
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,590
I'm excited to bell towards doing it.
I'm excited.

511
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:56,424
Spike TV's doing it.
I'm excited that they're putting on 

512
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,370
kickboxing.
I just,

513
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:00,990
uh,
I just wonder what's,

514
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,940
what's missing?
Like you know,

515
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,150
the UFC needed the ultimate fighter 
before the ultimate fighter.

516
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:09,300
Nobody,
nobody had a fucking clue as to what MMA

517
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:09,890
was.

518
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:10,723
They really didn't know.
It was just a few people that hurting 

519
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,430
UFC from the old days and the hoists 
gracie days and the vast majority of the

520
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:18,264
public was kind of out of the loop and 
then they put on the ultimate fighter 

521
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,210
and you know,
it was sort of the,

522
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,313
the prime of reality tv back then and 
that fight between forrest griffin and 

523
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,694
Stephan Bonner,
which was such a wild ass fight that 

524
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,380
sort of made mma.
I mean it really did.

525
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:38,700
It made the UFC and ballot or needs 
something like that they need,

526
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,010
what if those two played it safe that 
night?

527
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,170
It's a good point.
What would we be here,

528
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:44,130
Joe?
It's a good point.

529
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:45,540
Where would we be jobs?
Good point.

530
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,050
I'd probably be in Texas now doing stand
up.

531
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:48,883
Yeah.
I probably would have never worked for 

532
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:53,320
the,
you probably would have went under.

533
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,161
Yeah,
man.

534
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:54,994
I mean keyboard warriors were telling 
forrest griffin how sloppy he looked at 

535
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:58,114
night and Stephan Bonner was,
it showed or whenever the fuck they 

536
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:01,504
would say,
you know,

537
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,660
what does a chode does anybody know 
know?

538
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,350
Is that a real thing?
Um,

539
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,050
you know what they like to call people 
today?

540
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:10,630
I've known as a cook.
I cook a cock.

541
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,400
That's a big thing.
I said,

542
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,623
well,
you know what it is.

543
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,710
It's like the kids on the unit that have
found a new insult.

544
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,780
It was like cock has only been around 
for like,

545
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,920
yeah,
okay.

546
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,390
See You k.
Yeah,

547
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,683
well it comes from a cuckold which is 
like a guy who likes watching his wife 

548
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:33,931
get fucked by other men,
usually manlier men and uh,

549
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,430
how the correct term,
Joey,

550
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:37,180
how do you know that?

551
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,130
I'm online.
I frequented the Internet starts to cut,

552
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,443
cut,
cut.

553
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,080
Cold.
Right.

554
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,710
Am I correct me if I'm wrong,
Jamie,

555
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:47,470
but I believe that's what it's about.
You know,

556
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,570
who would know of wish Jim Norton was 
here.

557
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,940
He could explain this to us in its 
entirety,

558
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,103
but there is a whole genre of porn based
her on around like really nerdy white 

559
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,810
guys who have like this smoking hot wife
that's not satisfied.

560
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,170
And some guys like shut the fuck up and 
sit down.

561
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:05,470
I'm gonna fuck your wife in front of 
you.

562
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,753
Oh No.
And they cry and some of them they made 

563
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,650
the,
they make the husband suck their dick.

564
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:15,670
That happens too.
Well yeah that's a cook.

565
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:19,490
Now the husband is stuck state cause the
cook comes in as much of,

566
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,300
that guy's a stud guy who comes in and 
smashes it.

567
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,410
But I don't know if she's just stud.

568
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,360
If he lets the guy suck his deck,
that's just weird.

569
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,210
That's where it goes deep.
You know there's like a spectrum.

570
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:32,710
Even at cock porn keeping cock porn has 
a,

571
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,650
there's a lot of variables they have to 
take into consideration.

572
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,470
But I see people calling people cox all 
the time.

573
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,210
Like when they're,
you know,

574
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,110
you're calling another man at cook.
Yeah.

575
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,023
As an insult.
What does that say about you and the 

576
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:45,310
porn that you watched it,
you know,

577
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,383
that is,
that just says you frequent like reddit 

578
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,950
or something or you're on twitter all 
the time.

579
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,560
I mean,
I don't think it says anything about it.

580
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,010
I just think it's a new thing to call 
someone to hurt their feelings.

581
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,960
You know,
like there's no other,

582
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,020
there's no equivalent word.
Like it's a new,

583
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:05,860
it's a new sort of like a classification
of someone to call someone to cook.

584
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,180
You fucking cook.
Yeah.

585
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:08,610
You cock well On.
I'm just,

586
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,320
I have to start calling people that 
don't do it.

587
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,333
If we just promoted it to the world is 
now kind of thing before it now it's 

588
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:19,150
going to be fucking Holy Shit.
No,

589
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:19,984
they've been doing it forever.
They're going to call people like 

590
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,490
Hashtag powerful cook.
Oh,

591
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:27,370
you just started something now.
Man just made a big mistake.

592
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,070
You know when I noticed it a lot when a 
Kurt Kurt Metzger,

593
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:36,100
Ooh,
he's a writer for Amy Schumer show.

594
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,900
He's funny.
Standup comedian.

595
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,130
Very funny guy.
And,

596
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:39,964
uh,
he was one of the writers for Amy 

597
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,660
Schumer's show when she was getting 
accused of plagiarism and all this stuff

598
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:46,370
was going on and I was seeing all these 
people calling them a cook.

599
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,870
And I was like,
what is this?

600
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,400
And then I noticed it was like 
everywhere.

601
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:52,040
People call people cooks.
Like everyone's a cook.

602
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,110
Cook.
It's a just a phase.

603
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,880
I hope so.
There you go.

604
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,460
So if someone calls you a cook now,
you know,

605
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,630
I'd be like,
what am I a chicken?

606
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,450
Fuck is that I don't get it.
Cluck.

607
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,940
Now I will get it.
Yeah,

608
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,640
the Internet.
I don't know all of my,

609
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,200
all the haters.
Now we're going to,

610
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:10,610
could we call me a cook?
You think?

611
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,013
I don't think it'll work.
It doesn't work if you don't like 

612
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:17,960
actually watching your wife get gorilla 
fucked by some greater.

613
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,180
First of all,
you got to find a dude.

614
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:22,280
Fuck your wife day.
You can't kick his ass.

615
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,560
That's not,
it's not like a regular guy,

616
00:24:24,561 --> 00:24:27,080
Joe Schilling.
So this is a different sort of scenario.

617
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,123
A real caucus.
Supposed to be like a feeble person who 

618
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:32,630
lets,
I'm a fucking Lawrence Taylor type dude.

619
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:35,930
Come into his bedroom and fuck the shit 
out of his little white wife.

620
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,670
Uh,
there's visual for it.

621
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:38,504
Yeah.
There you go.

622
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,070
That kind of a thing.
You know,

623
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,530
let's Tuck won't work on me.
I'm not,

624
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,670
but they'll try it on you anyway.

625
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,730
It's a,
I mean,

626
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,380
I wonder if we've run out of insults.
I mean it's just cause it's coq one that

627
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,270
using it so often,
even when it's not,

628
00:24:56,271 --> 00:24:58,730
it's not really applicable and they're 
doing it because it's a new one.

629
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:03,050
Like we got a new one just like,
it's not like this makes sense.

630
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:04,910
Let me call him a faggot.
This makes sense.

631
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:06,280
Let me call him a pussy.
No,

632
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,040
it's like we've got this world,
it's just throw it around until,

633
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,913
it's almost like they found a new word 
and they just throw in and around until 

634
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:17,591
it's useless and we're promoting it or 
were they useless quick right now,

635
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,960
which just reporters here.
Joe Schilling was just talking about the

636
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,070
world.
You and I are,

637
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,730
we're essentially journalists.
Yeah.

638
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,920
We're current events journalists,
we're trying and might,

639
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,350
there might be some old folks right now 
that it may be,

640
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,690
you know,
not in the same social groups is us.

641
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,250
Maybe they live in Iowa or something 
like that.

642
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,473
And uh,
they just trying to dip their toe into 

643
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:37,490
the rest of the world.
Like what,

644
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:38,900
what are these kids talking about these 
days?

645
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,063
Let me see.
A what a comedian and a kickboxer have 

646
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:42,104
to say about the world.
And then they find out about Cox and 

647
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:44,811
then,
uh,

648
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:45,644
you know,
their wife later is going through their 

649
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:48,800
google search.
She finds cock,

650
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:50,300
what the hell is it called?
Fuck is a cook.

651
00:25:50,301 --> 00:25:51,134
And then she starts looking up cook and 
she finds Kuk porn and that she gets 

652
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,970
excited and she thinks my man wants,
I'll God,

653
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,320
Oh fuck me in front of him.
I know what I'm gonna do.

654
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:02,480
I'm gonna set some shit up.
And then she,

655
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:04,010
uh,
goes on craigslist,

656
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:07,640
find some dude and she thinks she's 
fulfilling a fantasy.

657
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,210
Try Spice up the relationship and 
suicide,

658
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,120
murder,
suicide man.

659
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
Suicide probably,
right?

660
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,030
Yeah.
It's hard to come back from that one.

661
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,310
Depends on how far in that far out in 
the sticks we're talking about.

662
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,150
Yeah.
I think now with the Internet,

663
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,490
I don't think there really is a sticks 
anymore.

664
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,920
I think even in the sticks,
they still get all the data.

665
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:31,820
If you have a connection to the internet
and you can research stuff,

666
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:35,840
all the weirdness of the world will find
its way into your brain.

667
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800
There's no hiding anymore.
You can't hide from the cooks anymore.

668
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,663
Yeah.
It used to be like you could live in 

669
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:45,210
like some weird town in Kentucky and you
would never find out about the,

670
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,010
the golf people or the furries or any of
the weird shit out there.

671
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:50,844
But now you find out,
cause play the fuck's gonna find out 

672
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:57,090
about cause play in West Virginia,
you know,

673
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,080
to fuck his play.

674
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,460
We don't know what that is.
What planet am I on them too busy train,

675
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,303
know anything about this shit.
Too busy hanging out in downtown La 

676
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,413
represent and d t la son.
That's so our buddy magnus walker lives 

677
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,310
the uh,
Porsche guy.

678
00:27:11,311 --> 00:27:12,144
You ever seen his videos drives all 
around downtown La and classic 

679
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:16,680
Porsche's.
He was actually right.

680
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:17,514
His spot,
his loft or whatever is right next to 

681
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:21,630
where the first location of the yard.
My Gym.

682
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:23,700
I was running real.
No Shit.

683
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,180
So you're in the heart of it man.
What do you like about downtown La?

684
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,840
Um,
right now I like it cause it's,

685
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,910
it's uh,
it's close to the gym and uh,

686
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,970
it's close to my kid's house and it's,
it's convenient.

687
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:37,840
It's close to Hollywood.
It's like 15 minutes from Hollywood.

688
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,973
It's,
it's kind of right in the middle of 

689
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:40,470
everything.
Yeah,

690
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,400
it's funky too.

691
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,560
Now it's downtown La is kind of 
morphing,

692
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:44,100
right?
Yeah,

693
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,150
it's getting,
it's getting different.

694
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,400
They used to be like a very art,
you know,

695
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,113
art arts,
like arts district and like younger 

696
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,010
crowds,
not,

697
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,030
not too expensive now it's like super 
high end expensive,

698
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:00,060
like the property on this blowing up.
It's crazy how it's blowing up.

699
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,790
We were actually a listed on a place to 
do down there though.

700
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,480
Like there's like five bars downtown.
That's it.

701
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,380
Yeah.
It's not like,

702
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:08,903
I don't know.
I don't really enjoy it for like 

703
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:10,344
nightlife stuff,
some nice restaurants and know what it 

704
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:12,414
is.
I think people are craving something 

705
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:14,940
like that and they,
and they,

706
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,130
they see something happen.
Like it's happening,

707
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,360
it's happening,
it's happening right here.

708
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:19,194
Let's,
let's start building those type buying 

709
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,143
up.
And they're hoping that it becomes like 

710
00:28:22,441 --> 00:28:23,730
a New York,
you know,

711
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,590
cause de la doesn't have,
doesn't have one.

712
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,543
No,
it doesn't have like a place where 

713
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:28,860
anybody walks.
Yup.

714
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,470
Well La is like people say live in La 
but you live in burbank or Glenn Miller.

715
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,940
There's like 50 cities that have about 
this big of downtown as downtown La.

716
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,780
So yeah,
it's like La County.

717
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:41,670
If you live in La county,
you live in la,

718
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:44,010
but la itself,
La proper,

719
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,500
it's,
there's no way to walk.

720
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,200
It was like melrose street could kind of
walk on melrose.

721
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,034
Good luck.
Cross one of those streets people 

722
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:53,970
fucking run you over while the texting,
doing meth.

723
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,283
You know,
there's some cool spots downtown and it 

724
00:28:56,131 --> 00:28:59,130
was a complete,
no doubt that I like downtown La.

725
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,580
Jamie and I talked about putting a 
studio up in what we,

726
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:03,301
yeah,
well the,

727
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:07,410
I think what we might do,
you know we're going to set up a another

728
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:10,500
place around here,
but we were talking about doing a place.

729
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,560
I'm one of those pen houses.
I don't know it was a apartment.

730
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:14,394
Buildings Cause get an apartment.
I'm like a top floor with a woman's 

731
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,820
crazy views.
Right.

732
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,040
I just think that would enhance a 
podcast.

733
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,953
Yeah.
We were sitting here in behind us with 

734
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:25,170
some fucking sick view of the city,
especially at night picture Joe.

735
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,380
I love that was out there telling the 
other and the other room.

736
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,050
It's in the other room.
All right,

737
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,130
I'll go get it.
I'll go get it.

738
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,820
It's cool.
You still smoking?

739
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,870
That picture has you smoking?
You quit for a little while back.

740
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,020
I go back and forth.
I think a cat quit that shit dude.

741
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:43,900
I know you got to smell good.
It is no benefit.

742
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,100
Zero except the,
I don't give a fuck factor.

743
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,803
When would you say is something about 
when you decide I'm going to smoke a 

744
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:52,930
cigarette right now?

745
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,600
Clearly.
I don't give a fuck about my health.

746
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,680
I don't give a fuck about the future.
I don't give a fuck about cancer.

747
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,330
I don't give a fuck.
This is an,

748
00:30:01,331 --> 00:30:02,164
I know this is an,
I don't give a fuck moment that I guess 

749
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,520
there's some escape in that.
There's some fun in that.

750
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:07,354
And then you get the chemicals from the 
cigarette that you craving the nicotine 

751
00:30:13,811 --> 00:30:17,180
feeling a calmness that comes with it,
that washes over it.

752
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,420
You'd need a cigarette right now.
Feel it making me want one accident.

753
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,440
But you're a professional athlete man.
Yeah,

754
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,760
I am.
I can't be doing that.

755
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,823
Try vaping.
Try Sucking on those robot dixit 

756
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,270
everybody's got a,
yeah,

757
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,420
have a great sponsor who come up with 
that stuff.

758
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:33,730
I tried it.
You know a firebrand America.

759
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,650
Awesome,
powerful firebrand America.

760
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,810
It's that good of the really good.
It's really good.

761
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,673
They take really good care of me.
So do they have like one of those big 

762
00:30:40,091 --> 00:30:41,920
fat ones that looked like a cigarette 
box?

763
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,660
They have a whole bunch of those 
different kinds of,

764
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,240
what is the deal with all the mod?
I Dunno,

765
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,000
a mod.
It's called them on this guy,

766
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,320
the kid thing,
Cox and mods cook.

767
00:30:50,321 --> 00:30:51,154
Some months.
Furries I'm starting to cook is not 

768
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:55,410
going to catch on.
I still look at it.

769
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,090
I get it.
Cook,

770
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,460
which is called the Guy Cock your cock 
sucker.

771
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:01,550
Fucking nope,
nope,

772
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,453
nope,
nope,

773
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,720
nope.
You fucking cook.

774
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,580
Yeah,
they like it.

775
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,010
It's a new word.
It's exciting to use.

776
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:09,844
Let them use it.
The people haven't had a new word to 

777
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:15,550
call people and so long and they're 
trying to take away so many of them.

778
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,160
It used to be when I was a kid,
you can call a kid a Faggot,

779
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,060
you know?

780
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,360
Now you gay bashing.
Yeah,

781
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,960
but back then it had nothing to do with 
being gay,

782
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:25,480
but it's too late.
It's connected to that.

783
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,880
It's really hard to use.
Retard.

784
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,610
It's hard to use.
Retard.

785
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,180
No today.
You know,

786
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,073
even though it's not even a 
classification for mental illness is 

787
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:38,680
nothing to do with down syndrome.
Like retarded means slow growth,

788
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,663
like slow to catch on.
It is literally the perfect word to use 

789
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:44,284
for retards when someone's a retard,
like calling them a retard is a perfect 

790
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:48,304
word.
Like you would never say that about 

791
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:52,000
someone who has a disease or someone who
has down syndrome.

792
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,850
Right.
But if someone's like the won'ts,

793
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:57,860
trump wins what people took it over.
That's what retarded.

794
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,320
That's a retard.
Right.

795
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,720
Fucking recharge.
It's the right word.

796
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,643
It's the word.
These goddamn language police 

797
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,630
motherfuckers,
they've type sensitive,

798
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:11,530
sensitive punch.
Cox fucking sensitive.

799
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:16,530
Cucs they've traded debt catch up.
Maybe I do like it.

800
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,610
It's fucking,
we need a new card.

801
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:21,250
I'm happy it's a resident that actually 
works in the description.

802
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:22,084
Right.
It's weak little bitch that would let 

803
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:26,050
some other man fuck his wife.
Oh,

804
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:28,540
don't call him a retard.
Exactly.

805
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,870
We need to be more sensitive about the 
way we communicate both.

806
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:34,570
They're really trying to do is just 
control people.

807
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,460
It's a trying to,
it's the pussification.

808
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:41,090
Yes.
The God damn of America in America.

809
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:42,350
That's like the whole world.
The whole world.

810
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,420
Fucking pussification of everybody.
Oh yeah.

811
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:45,683
Well it's,
and it's also not being honest about 

812
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:50,420
what the fuck's going on.
You know,

813
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,313
like when something happens we have to 
be real sensitive to who we insult post 

814
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,163
post like attacks.
Like with his shit that was going on in 

815
00:32:59,331 --> 00:33:00,164
Germany where all these women were 
getting raped during New Year's eve cut 

816
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,050
cause of all these Islamic refugees that
they had come in from Syria.

817
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,700
I mean it's just,
that's just the way it is.

818
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:08,060
Your,
your,

819
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,810
your people are coming from a completely
different culture in their culture.

820
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,240
Women are much more suppressed.
They come over to this country,

821
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,093
Germany where women or Western eyes,
they're free and they're wearing skirts 

822
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,264
and their tits or hanging out and w 
they're dressed normal and to getting 

823
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:25,040
attacked.
And so what is the fucking mayor of,

824
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:26,330
was it Berlin?
Tell them,

825
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,213
stay away from men and dress different,
stay an arm's length away from men and 

826
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,880
dress more conservatively.
Like literally this fucking,

827
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,743
these people are so sensitive and 
worried that they're going to hurt 

828
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:43,610
someone's feelings or they're going to 
be called Islamophobic or racist in some

829
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:45,110
way,
that they're,

830
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,870
they're telling women who've done 
nothing wrong,

831
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,833
that they should dress differently 
because they've unfortunately let these 

832
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:55,940
people in from another culture that 
think about things differently.

833
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,830
Yeah.
Bunch of cooks.

834
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:02,940
Fucking cooks sensitive dazzle.
The mayor of Berlin or wherever it was,

835
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,960
it was a woman.
Was it Berlin?

836
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,630
I remember the city was,
but that's a woman,

837
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:09,464
so it's even more confusing.
But boy did she get fucking raked over 

838
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,420
the coals online.
People are getting tired of it.

839
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,760
The pendulum swings both ways.
You know,

840
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:17,594
it swings towards ultra sensitivity and 
then people get sick of that and they 

841
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:21,590
go,
what the fuck?

842
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:25,250
And then they go hard the other way.
I think that's one the reasons why trump

843
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,113
is the republican nominee.
I think Caitlyn Jenner is responsible 

844
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,134
for a lot of it.
I think people saw that and they're 

845
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:33,890
like,
what the fuck?

846
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:34,990
They just like,
why?

847
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,390
What are you doing?
What are,

848
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,740
what does this 62 year old man now he's 
a woman.

849
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:41,930
Call me kate on the cover of Vanity 
Fair.

850
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:44,060
Got To be naked on the cover of sports 
illustrated.

851
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,460
And then she wasn't like athlete of the 
year.

852
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,630
So Fuck Outta here.
Get the fuck out of it.

853
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:51,800
She one woman of the year.
Yeah.

854
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,930
Woman of the year.
She a woman for a week.

855
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,123
She wins women of the year.
Just shows you men can do everything 

856
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,100
including could when women in the year 
we,

857
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,510
this cock Jamie pulled up the fucking 
definition.

858
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:03,523
Is this an urban dictionary is a better 
definition I think than the one you 

859
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:06,411
gave.
Oh.

860
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:07,244
How dare you?
A demasculated millennial liberal male 

861
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:14,460
who often speaks of white privilege and 
modern feminism blames white men for all

862
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,370
of the world's problems.
Hmm.

863
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,050
It's the new definition there,
but it now I like,

864
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,343
I like this though.
There it goes chat again with the 

865
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,610
megaphone telling everyone that he's a 
Vegan.

866
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,050
What a cook.
Okay.

867
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,750
I liked that.
I liked that a lot.

868
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,690
But um,
look up cock hold,

869
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:35,990
but cock hold is different.

870
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,800
It's a different,
uh,

871
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:43,220
short for conservative.
What they fucking till word cock is most

872
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:48,561
commonly used on twitter to describe 
anti white males while it was originally

873
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:51,000
formed with the original meaning of 
Kack.

874
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,313
Kack hold the use of the word cock does 
not necessarily denote a sexual 

875
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:56,701
connotation.
Wow.

876
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,534
It's morphing.
The language is evolving before our 

877
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:00,384
eyes.
Cox do not care about Islamic countries 

878
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:03,954
throwing gays off buildings or hanging 
them as much as the cake Baker who is 

879
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:10,560
Christian and weren't served gay wedding
customers.

880
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,490
Oh,
that's interesting.

881
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,623
Coxe.
Give a free pass to anyone who 

882
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:16,620
criticized them for fear of looking 
racist or homophobic.

883
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:18,390
We'll still have that lady in Germany is
a cook.

884
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,870
The word originated from white 
nationalists vocabulary,

885
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:24,480
but it's still widely used by all.
Okay.

886
00:36:24,481 --> 00:36:26,820
But that,
so,

887
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:30,930
but they took cock hold and turned it 
into this new thing go to.

888
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,900
But what is cut the definition for Koc 
hole.

889
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:37,280
So this has nothing to do with guys' 
wives getting banged by Chris.

890
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,490
She does to me.

891
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,990
It's still real to me,
dammit.

892
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:40,903
I was also like an official definition 
that I'm like a an old dictionary from 

893
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:45,770
old English.
Oh it means a man.

894
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:48,810
His wife was unfaithful cut cold,
which is yeah,

895
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,550
to make a cuckold of so if you,
okay,

896
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:53,384
that's uh,
that's how Norton I think described it 

897
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,340
to me like a man.
If your,

898
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,183
if your wife is out banging other dudes 
and you know about it but you don't say 

899
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:02,570
anything,
you become a hold.

900
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,453
But there's also like cock hold porn 
where it's like I said the guys there 

901
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,950
while like sobbing in the corner while 
his wife gets grilled.

902
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:14,840
Fucked.
Interesting.

903
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,750
The world is evolving.
Beautiful.

904
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,070
So it's still open,

905
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:22,070
open season then for use cook anyway you
want,

906
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,103
because it hit like five definitions.
I still have a fucking clue what that 

907
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,580
means.
Yeah.

908
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:31,240
I mean a bunch of cooks,
cooks.

909
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,260
I liked that one definition though that 
the,

910
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,123
the Vegan gets on the megaphone.
It's usually a Vegan who's been a Vegan 

911
00:37:37,181 --> 00:37:38,620
for like a month two.
All right.

912
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,753
Those are my favorite fucking Cox boy.
How do you pull out of this and have a 

913
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:47,830
normal conversation?
Where do we go from here,

914
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,180
jo?
Where did we go?

915
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,073
So,
um,

916
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,440
tell me what it's like working with 
Scott Coker and what a,

917
00:37:53,441 --> 00:37:54,274
this whole,
I mean you are the face of Bella tore 

918
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:56,434
kickboxing there.
They're really promoting you hard like 

919
00:37:57,881 --> 00:38:00,730
the belt or kickboxing logo has your,
your image,

920
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,593
you know,
you was it like you throwing a knee I 

921
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:03,304
think,
is it I think or you throwing a punch 

922
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,880
or,
or is it an elbow something,

923
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:07,803
but it's,
you're seeing like so many of these 

924
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:14,200
Bella tore kickboxing promos that have 
your face on it.

925
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,213
Yeah.

926
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,290
It's a good feeling.
You know,

927
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,410
Scott Coker is a big fan of kickboxing.
Yes,

928
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,480
he is.
Um,

929
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:21,571
yeah,
he's,

930
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,230
he's,
he's really pushing it.

931
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,010
I think the Viacom and spike sports are 
really pushing it.

932
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,883
They really get behind and they're 
trying to promote the sport and you 

933
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:30,904
know,
I'm blessed that I'm a big part of that 

934
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:35,650
and they're trying to do that for me.
Scott and

935
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,950
Belterra general,
it was just always treated me really,

936
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:40,000
really well.
Really well.

937
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,490
They need to bail on that name.
Bella terra,

938
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,600
you hate it,
hate it,

939
00:38:43,601 --> 00:38:45,280
hate it.
There you go.

940
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,690
So you're throwing an elbow.
I'm right.

941
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:47,543
Oh,
Bella toward kickbox and leave that 

942
00:38:48,341 --> 00:38:51,290
brother.
Oh cause I am called POW.

943
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,390
You know the elbow torque.
Yeah.

944
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,243
That's even weirder.
You're throwing an elbow and you're not 

945
00:38:56,231 --> 00:38:57,550
allowed to elbow.
Yeah.

946
00:38:57,551 --> 00:39:01,210
What the fuck?
It just shows how ridiculous it is.

947
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,800
Why don't they just do Moitai well,
I mean like I watched lion fight.

948
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,123
They,
they're just doing straight Moy Tai and 

949
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,050
it seems pretty popular,
although it's on access TV.

950
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,390
And I think the uh,
the k one model,

951
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,370
um,
worked really well.

952
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,360
I think that,
you know what I mean?

953
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,670
Why Change?
It obviously worked for so long.

954
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,220
Um,
because the other stuff works.

955
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,710
Like if you're going to strike,
if you just going to do striking,

956
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,270
why not throw elbows?

957
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,400
I mean,
why not throw knees and the clinch?

958
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:29,590
Why not be able to click clinch and 
sweep?

959
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,040
Why not be able to do all the things 
that make [inaudible] special?

960
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,220
Why not take off him and made gloves 
went not stomp on his face?

961
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,320
Why not?
Do you know what I mean?

962
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:40,480
I want to say everything can change.
That's right.

963
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,030
Bare knuckle,
bare knuckled tiger.

964
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,590
You're going to bring those?
I had to bring it up.

965
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,770
Does anybody bald?
I know in Thailand they're still,

966
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:51,220
like I saw Sam Chai had a fight recently
where they were wearing,

967
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,650
I'm just essentially hand wraps.
Yeah,

968
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,870
but the paint thick hand wraps.
That's like a rope.

969
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,970
Yeah.
Bounded fist matches a Thai fight.

970
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:00,730
They still do that every,
every couple hour long.

971
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,713
What's the benefit of that?
Because it looks like it's still a lot 

972
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:06,250
of padding it.
I think it's more about the Thai culture

973
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:07,084
and that was like the,
the Siam Warrior days when they were 

974
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:10,684
going to war,
they had that kind of thing and the 

975
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:13,840
Hmong con that they were,
when they walked off of the thing,

976
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,340
we would work,
they would wear that around.

977
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,430
They wouldn't take that off like they 
are now.

978
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,110
They would pull it down when they wear 
it around their neck,

979
00:40:20,111 --> 00:40:21,760
like a necklace when they would fight 
and go to war.

980
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,990
Really?
But it's still the same thing.

981
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:26,440
It's like a cloth that's been blessed.
It might be your,

982
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,543
your mother shirt or something like 
special and you're taking that with you 

983
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,960
to bottle.
You would never take that off.

984
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,750
And years and years ago,
no shit.

985
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:35,584
When did they start taking it off?
Somebody's got to be big deal choked 

986
00:40:37,121 --> 00:40:40,540
with it probably.
I mean I know that was a boy.

987
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:44,030
Barron is a traditional martial arts 
style of Moitai.

988
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,690
Before it became a sport,
it was more Brown.

989
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,560
That's where you see like Tony,
John and those guys.

990
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,280
Oh run up you and dropped elbows and 
like the war,

991
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,653
um,
style of Thai was [inaudible] which is 

992
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:57,790
what those bounded fix things are.

993
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,940
It's more about like giving a,
showing their culture.

994
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:03,630
I think it's interest proud of when we 
tie in Thailand.

995
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,010
That's their national sport.
Well they should be,

996
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,850
I mean they figured out the best way to 
take care of someone's legs.

997
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,790
I mean they really did figure out the 
best way to leg kick.

998
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,420
They figured out the best way to throw 
elbows in the clinch.

999
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:17,283
I mean it's,
it's so many excellent things came at 

1000
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,210
him with tyler yet.
It's interesting that this one country,

1001
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,610
I mean sit,
pretend Thailand didn't exist.

1002
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:27,430
It's a very small country.
If Thailand didn't exist,

1003
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:30,850
like literally all of combat striking 
would be very different.

1004
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,013
Right.
One of the most influential countries 

1005
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:34,154
ever.
If you really take into consideration 

1006
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,710
like there what they've contributed to 
overall combat sports.

1007
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,640
Thailand is one of the most influential 
countries ever next to Brazil.

1008
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:44,743
But I guess Japan because that's the 
first and foremost because the Japanese 

1009
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,330
even taught Jujitsu to Elio,
Gracie and Carlos Gracie,

1010
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:54,164
and then it became Brazilian Jujitsu.
But Brazil is responsible for a massive 

1011
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,440
amount of evolution of submission 
fighting.

1012
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:05,480
But other than that you got I guess 
western wrestling,

1013
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,380
you know,
but,

1014
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,540
but that's Russia.
That's a lot of countries.

1015
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:12,420
We did start talking about wrestling and
then you got boxing,

1016
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,720
which was,
yeah,

1017
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,850
martial arts is not used as 
predominantly in mma.

1018
00:42:16,851 --> 00:42:19,400
So like mma makes the sport,
you know,

1019
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,263
you're,
you're talking about Brazil and what 

1020
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:24,710
it's done for,
for the sport.

1021
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:26,060
Well that's the sports style of it,
you know.

1022
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:26,894
But like cook food was,
was a huge martial art from China and 

1023
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,930
judo and karate.
And you know,

1024
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,190
before there was guns and bombs and,
and uh,

1025
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,890
cucs everywhere,
there was weird,

1026
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,033
it was like vikings who had fucking 
swords that like when across the globe 

1027
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:43,130
and fucking raped and pillaged and 
dominated people and you know,

1028
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,580
humans millions a year.
I remember many years ago it was,

1029
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,320
you know,
they were animals and killing people and

1030
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:54,920
going to war and there were all of these
countries made up,

1031
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,953
you know,
Samurais and made up their own style or 

1032
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:59,090
whatever.
But like I think Burma,

1033
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,780
which is like right next to Thailand has
like Burmese boxing,

1034
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:03,614
which is very similar to Cambodia,
has tire it's own version of those 

1035
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,570
things,
you know?

1036
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:09,590
Yeah,
yeah.

1037
00:43:09,591 --> 00:43:12,110
There was a Bondo,
you know,

1038
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,210
which is a from,
that's from Burma too,

1039
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:15,020
right?
Yep.

1040
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,853
But no kickbox some amazing that the 
style that the ties use as far as the 

1041
00:43:19,851 --> 00:43:20,684
clinching the knees in a clinch and the 
kicks and elbows in the clinch in and 

1042
00:43:23,931 --> 00:43:25,310
leg kicks.
Like they,

1043
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,970
they really revolutionized stand up 
striking certainly in MMA.

1044
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,360
I'm sure one of the most important 
aspects of mma.

1045
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:33,883
And you know,
some guys just become so proficient at 

1046
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:37,391
it.
It's,

1047
00:43:37,391 --> 00:43:38,224
it's,
it's interesting when you watch pure 

1048
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:41,630
Thai boxing,
like,

1049
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:45,800
like a yachts and Cli or like really 
high level Thai guys.

1050
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,060
You Watch it,
you're like,

1051
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:47,894
wow,
this is like a totally different way of 

1052
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:49,934
doing it.
Like they have a very specific style 

1053
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,443
type of style and you watch the let you 
see the high level guys come over and 

1054
00:43:57,021 --> 00:44:00,020
fight in the U S it's really interesting
how successful they are.

1055
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,530
Hmm.
Oh yeah.

1056
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,110
Unlike San shy,
you know,

1057
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:03,944
it was a,
has a very exciting style on a very 

1058
00:44:06,841 --> 00:44:07,674
different style.
He uses a lot of Meu Baran techniques 

1059
00:44:11,101 --> 00:44:11,821
that,
you know,

1060
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:13,510
the Cartwheel Kit,
cause I'm with Veronica,

1061
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,580
you know,
so he's uh,

1062
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,013
his,
uh,

1063
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,613
you know,
in Thailand there's the culture of Muay 

1064
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,970
Thai and the level is so unbelievably 
high that uh,

1065
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,560
that's the,
the evolvement,

1066
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,660
you know,
has really involved.

1067
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:28,720
Yeah.
Um,

1068
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,713
Sanchez really light on his feet too.
It's interesting watch fight because 

1069
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:32,100
he's

1070
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,120
not like,
you know,

1071
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:33,954
we think of a,
like a tie fighters being like light 

1072
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,130
with the front leg,
what kind of plodding forward.

1073
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,880
But Sanchez like very light on his feet.
Like real good footwork,

1074
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:43,290
moves around a lot,
a lot,

1075
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:45,210
a lot.
I like a lot of,

1076
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:48,510
um,
faints and a lot of like Mr Racks and,

1077
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,660
and I'm very,
very fast,

1078
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,180
very fast kicker too.
Interesting.

1079
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:57,330
Like there's so many good guys now that 
have come over from Thailand,

1080
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,010
young guys to look Joe,
not a want,

1081
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,823
you know,
it's um,

1082
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,930
it's really good time to watch just even
straight Moy Tai.

1083
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,123
Yeah.
I mean he got guys with 200 fights that 

1084
00:45:06,961 --> 00:45:07,794
were trained by guys from,
with 200 fights that were trained by 

1085
00:45:09,811 --> 00:45:12,480
guys with 200 fights.
There were towns guys by 200 fights,

1086
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:13,314
you know,
so it's uh,

1087
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,383
you know,
and they start when they're seven years 

1088
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:19,170
old and that's just their way of life 
and their culture and their,

1089
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,173
you know,
we tie is like in their blood and then 

1090
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:23,490
their DNA and their,
uh,

1091
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,690
you know,
I have 95 cents a mile now.

1092
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,590
90 fights,
nick.

1093
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:28,423
Man,
it's a lot of fights.

1094
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:29,430
I'm like,
that ain't shit.

1095
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:32,700
That was like a 15 year old in Thailand 
for a boxer.

1096
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:33,780
That's crazy.
Right?

1097
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,830
Find a boxer has 90 fights and it's 
pretty rare.

1098
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:41,190
Well,
I mean like he had like 150 images.

1099
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:42,250
Did he really?
Yeah.

1100
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,973
What is the most,
anybody's ever had an mma I think is 

1101
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:47,304
Travis Fulton.
I think Travis Fulton as like full 300 

1102
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,870
fights.
I think he has 300 fights.

1103
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:53,343
Yeah,
Jeremy Horn I think at 200 or close to 

1104
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:56,290
it.
That was,

1105
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:57,803
I thought I saw Jeremy Horn fighting 
this janky little fucking card once in 

1106
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:03,030
a,
somewhere in California.

1107
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:03,864
I forget where we want some Indian 
casino or something like that where you 

1108
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:07,554
weren't allowed to,
you weren't allowed to punch you a lot 

1109
00:46:10,261 --> 00:46:13,950
of slap slap to the face,
but you will have to kick to the face.

1110
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,340
And it was just,
it was like when mma was illegal,

1111
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,220
like pink creation.

1112
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,613
Yeah.
When MMA was illegal there was like a 

1113
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:22,914
bunch of loopholes that they were 
exploiting cause you couldn't fight mma 

1114
00:46:26,221 --> 00:46:27,054
in California for a long time.
So they came up with all sorts of 

1115
00:46:30,241 --> 00:46:32,310
different ways of doing it though.
They call,

1116
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:34,950
you have to throw seven kicks before 
they didn't have that.

1117
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,023
But they had slaps like that was a,
that was another thing that existed in 

1118
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:40,830
Japan.
The early days,

1119
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:42,870
the pancreas style,
which is real.

1120
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:43,704
It's real weird to watch now boss route.
The guys figured out how to insulate it 

1121
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,263
though he hacked it because he threw 
palms like punches where everybody else 

1122
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:52,734
was throwing bitch slaps.
Bas rutten was knocking guys out with 

1123
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:58,950
palm strikes cause he was throwing like 
palm upper cuts and palm hooks.

1124
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:01,310
He figured out how to hack it.
Yeah.

1125
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,440
That crazy fucker is he fucking kicked 
the lever.

1126
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:08,730
That lever cake.

1127
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,120
Yeah.
He's uh,

1128
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,340
he's another guy who paid the price 
physically his uh,

1129
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,203
his craziness and his,
his madness in his pursuit because he 

1130
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:19,710
just,
he would talk about,

1131
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,544
I mean talked about on the podcast,
he would just shoot cortisone into his 

1132
00:47:22,711 --> 00:47:26,820
joints and his shins and just numb 
everything up and lie to Cain.

1133
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:30,700
He shoot lidacain into his shins and so 
they cannot lie to keynes,

1134
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:32,920
a numbing agent.
Novacane right.

1135
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:34,840
It's like the gay cousin of cocaine.
Hmm.

1136
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,200
It doesn't get you high,
but it just leaves me numb and confused.

1137
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,130
I can't cousin.
Okay.

1138
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:39,701
Yeah,
I got it.

1139
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:41,740
I had lot of cane in my nose wants,
uh,

1140
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,140
when I had my nose operating on.
And uh,

1141
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,990
it's a,
it's interesting like it makes you like,

1142
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,270
you feel weak and disoriented,
but you're not,

1143
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,010
you're not drugged up.
You're like,

1144
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:52,800
something's wrong with me.
I got to,

1145
00:47:52,801 --> 00:47:53,441
I can't,
I can't,

1146
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:55,090
like I could drive,
I could walk,

1147
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:56,250
I could talk to people,
but I'm like,

1148
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,250
I'm just not.

1149
00:47:57,310 --> 00:48:00,570
So he would inject it into the Shin so 
it wouldn't because he was injured his,

1150
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,660
because he wouldn't feel it when he 
kicked it.

1151
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,100
I'd have to ask boss again,
get the full story.

1152
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,220
But I know a in checked in cortisone 
into all of his joints,

1153
00:48:09,221 --> 00:48:12,660
just rectum is no cartilage in any of 
his joints.

1154
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,490
His knees are completely shot.
It's all bone on bone.

1155
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,830
He was actually going to get them 
resurfaced.

1156
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,080
You ever seen when someone gets it 
resurfaced?

1157
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,350
My friend Steve Graham had his knee 
done.

1158
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,780
I'll show you a picture of you.
You're going to get grossed out.

1159
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,063
He was,
uh,

1160
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,040
he was on the Olympic ski team.
Yeah.

1161
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:33,160
Why am I fucking am in so much?
He was on the US ski team,

1162
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:33,994
I should say.
I don't know,

1163
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,940
he wasn't any Olympics,
but he was um,

1164
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,080
a top flight skier and had upwards of 20
operations on his knee.

1165
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,600
Yeah.
I'm not exaggerating.

1166
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:48,670
And this is what his needs look like 
now.

1167
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,230
The resurface the inside of his knee 
because he was bone on bone,

1168
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,243
so they put steel caps over the joints.
So the way his Tibia and fibula 

1169
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:05,583
intersect with each other.
And then I'm assuming that like they 

1170
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:08,254
don't rust or no,
it's stainless steel slide over each 

1171
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:12,150
other.
Speak.

1172
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,700
And that white shit is like a artificial
meniscus,

1173
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:19,390
like artificial padding in between the 
steel.

1174
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:20,261
How's it work?
Is it good?

1175
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:22,770
If he's happy,
it's all good.

1176
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,700
It's all right.
You know,

1177
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,200
I mean,
he's a crazy fucker.

1178
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,393
He's in pain all the time,
but he's just one of those dudes 

1179
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,410
[inaudible] some people just not a suck 
it up.

1180
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,300
Would you have done to your knee?

1181
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,180
Uh,
I tore my MCL,

1182
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:41,570
my MCL,
like detached from my Shin and then that

1183
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:46,520
allowed my knee and I tore my acl and 
half and then I partially tore my lcl.

1184
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:47,354
So it was,
it was like four 10 ins and your whole 

1185
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,893
journey,
like two of them were completely torn 

1186
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:54,920
and then one of them was pretty fucking 
close to being completely joint.

1187
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,420
Wow.
What happened there?

1188
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,090
I took a fight on short notice and I'm 
in Vegas.

1189
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:05,130
I did 40 a Chinese guy and uh,
he's like the sand chow.

1190
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,950
I don't even know what Sanchez was.
They were like,

1191
00:50:06,951 --> 00:50:07,784
they told me the rules for like five 
minutes before the fight in the back of 

1192
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:11,760
backstage,
I was throwing it,

1193
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,050
went to throw a knee.
And as I was like standing on one foot,

1194
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,620
as I was standing on one foot throwing 
the knee,

1195
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,320
he'd kicked right under my,
my knee.

1196
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:24,590
And it shifted so hard that it just 
ripped my blow everything out.

1197
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,453
Oh,
wow.

1198
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,533
And then,
uh,

1199
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,750
be in the savage that I am,
I,

1200
00:50:29,751 --> 00:50:30,584
uh,
took the eight countenance stood up and 

1201
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:34,640
I was like,
I tried to fight anyway and I'm like,

1202
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:35,630
oh,
he's going to kick my leg.

1203
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:36,441
So I'm like,
oh,

1204
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:39,110
I know what I'm going to do.
So as he runs to kick my leg,

1205
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:39,973
I jumped over it like Aha.
But I landed on the one that went out 

1206
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:44,511
again.
And then,

1207
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:45,344
uh,
I don't know if it wasn't completely 

1208
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:48,680
torn at that point.
It definitely was after that,

1209
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,540
so,
but uh,

1210
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:51,201
yeah,
I did that.

1211
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,140
And then that same fight I had,
um,

1212
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,890
my other knee ended up getting like a 
quarter size piece of cartilage torn out

1213
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,230
and was floating around in the joint.
It was,

1214
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,073
it was a rough fight.

1215
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,700
It was a rough thousand dollars back 
then.

1216
00:51:01,701 --> 00:51:05,450
Joe Thousand Bottles and bucks.
He's out for a year.

1217
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,720
God Damn.
But I'm going out.

1218
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,630
So it was out for a year and a,
when I came back I just went on a terror

1219
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:13,464
and that goes on at home.
I went on my belt and when like I don't 

1220
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,340
tend to know,
I think after that immediately after,

1221
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:19,703
no.
What kind of surgery did they do to do 

1222
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:25,520
cadavers and cadavers and a scope?
I don't even have that.

1223
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,730
You can't even tell if you look up my 
name,

1224
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:27,603
his name was,
gosh,

1225
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,173
that's amazing.
Doctor Maura and a Orange City of 

1226
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,050
Warren's to do an amazing job.
And uh,

1227
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,690
he fought with the insurance company.
For me it was,

1228
00:51:35,691 --> 00:51:37,010
they didn't want to do the cadaver 
thing.

1229
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,233
They wanted to like what they do is 
they'll actually cut a sliver out of 

1230
00:51:40,791 --> 00:51:43,910
your hamster tele or your hamstring 
tendon,

1231
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,760
which is the big fat 10 in that goes 
down to the front of your knee.

1232
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,950
I had that done and it would cut a 
sliver out of that.

1233
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:50,083
Take that piece,
put it in your acl and then wait for 

1234
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:54,530
that to scar over.
And I'm like,

1235
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,113
so I already have a weak knee.
You're going to fucking take the one of 

1236
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:00,590
the only tendons I have left and make 
that one week again.

1237
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,720
I didn't go for it.
So we did the cadaver thing,

1238
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:06,560
which is crazy.
It's like a dead body Barton obviously.

1239
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,770
And then I guess once they put it in 
your body,

1240
00:52:09,771 --> 00:52:13,100
like mutates it and they're like,
takes a while to get soft again and then

1241
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:15,530
you,
your body will take it out as its own.

1242
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,541
Well,
your body,

1243
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:20,020
it acts as a scaffolding.
It's not like the cadaver itself is,

1244
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,913
stays in your body,
your body uses the tissue that the 

1245
00:52:22,901 --> 00:52:23,734
cadaver graft is on to sort of 
peripherally pro proliferate with its 

1246
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:30,610
own cells.
So uh,

1247
00:52:30,611 --> 00:52:33,220
that's why they use an achilles tendon 
because it's larger.

1248
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,610
I had that done in my right knee.
It was way quicker recovery.

1249
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:40,120
The left knee,
I had bolt acl done the left knee,

1250
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:42,520
I did the Patella thing like way back 
in,

1251
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,220
I think it was 1993 or four.
So it was back in the day,

1252
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,054
they didn't do the cadaver back then.
They only did the Patella tendon graft 

1253
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,800
or they did even worse.
The hamstring,

1254
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:54,783
which is a real bad one cause then your 
hamstring has to recover and they take 

1255
00:52:58,271 --> 00:53:01,930
just take a chunk out of your hamstring 
and then just fucking bolted into place.

1256
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,273
I think that has to the same thing.
Your body has to proliferate it with 

1257
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,380
cells and you know,
it has to make,

1258
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:13,960
you got to make sure that blood supplies
working and so it's a lot of work.

1259
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:14,903
No,
they can do like prp and all this cool 

1260
00:53:16,231 --> 00:53:17,700
stuff.
You were talking about that Orange Shit.

1261
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:18,563
Last one is here.

1262
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:19,983
Oh,
now they're doing stem cell treatments 

1263
00:53:21,071 --> 00:53:23,060
for a lot of people.
I know Daniel Cormier,

1264
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:25,030
I had that done.
He was really close to get knee,

1265
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,500
had some stem cells in it and heals 
right up.

1266
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:29,910
It was right up.
It's just amazing.

1267
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:30,744
They can take what they're,
they're finding with stem cells is that 

1268
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:34,164
it can take on the form,
especially if they're doing it from 

1269
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:37,980
women's,
um,

1270
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,090
uh,
placenta,

1271
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,810
like a woman who gets a sterian section.
We'll take a young girl who's getting it

1272
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:45,450
says hereon section.
They take her placenta and they take the

1273
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:46,284
stem cells out of that and then they can
inject it into various areas of your 

1274
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:51,990
body and it can become anything.
It can be good but tendon,

1275
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:54,780
it can become a ligament.
It could repair torn muscles.

1276
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,540
It's really interesting what they're 
able to do,

1277
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:01,830
but there's also some danger apparently,
especially if you go to Mexico.

1278
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,790
Some,
uh,

1279
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,910
some dude went to a bunch of different 
places.

1280
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,773
I think he went to like six different 
places to get stem cells cause he had a 

1281
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:11,480
back problem.
And um,

1282
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,373
he started growing some weird tumor in 
his back that was like pressing on his 

1283
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:21,681
spine and when they cut the tumor out,
they realized it was not his tissue,

1284
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,420
that it was like someone else's tissue 
was growing in his body.

1285
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:32,670
Like somebody like whoever's stem cell.
Yeah.

1286
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:35,220
He's like trying to get like a uterus.
You got a uterus is laying around.

1287
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,050
I mean since I was off of that and 
they're like,

1288
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,913
oh yeah,
give him that fucking tumor we took out 

1289
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,340
of the guide stem cell.
Right.

1290
00:54:41,341 --> 00:54:42,570
Other work,
the fund can say,

1291
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,780
well if you're going to Russia or Mexico
oil and cut off often in there.

1292
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,440
I mean I don't,
I'm obviously not a doctor so I don't,

1293
00:54:51,441 --> 00:54:56,000
I don't know exactly what they did in 
these other countries that uh,

1294
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,830
they're,
they're trying to pass off as stem cells

1295
00:54:58,831 --> 00:54:59,664
mean.
Who knows what the fuck they injected 

1296
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:01,374
this guy with.
But it used to be you'd have to go to 

1297
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:06,890
foreign countries to get stem cell 
treatments cause you know,

1298
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:07,733
they weren't exactly sure.
It was eight apparently helped this guy 

1299
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:11,670
once and then it started to go away.

1300
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:13,980
Like whatever benefits he was getting 
started going away.

1301
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:14,814
And then he's like,
I'm just going to go on a fucking mad 

1302
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:18,390
tear all across the world and get stem 
cells,

1303
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,890
third world stem cells towards believe 
it didn't work out for him.

1304
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:24,300
I don't know.
It's fucked.

1305
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:24,880
They,
they,

1306
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,713
they cut like a fucking,
like a cod out of his back and then 

1307
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,534
they've probably to fix that,
they gave him like American stem cells 

1308
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:34,970
and everything's good.
I think he's done anything.

1309
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,710
Homeboys toast and he's,
he's definitely saying,

1310
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,090
uh,
I think his quote was,

1311
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:42,720
don't go in the future.
I would advise people strongly not to go

1312
00:55:42,721 --> 00:55:47,070
with anecdotal evidence,
solid advice right there.

1313
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,880
But um,
you know,

1314
00:55:49,881 --> 00:55:52,000
and don't help me a lot.
My shoulder,

1315
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:52,913
my shoulder was pretty fucked and I got 
stem cells and it's fucking fantastic 

1316
00:55:55,921 --> 00:55:56,670
now.
Yeah,

1317
00:55:56,670 --> 00:55:58,860
it feels great.
So he gets a little sore sometimes after

1318
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:00,930
a hard workout,
but just ice it up and it's good to go.

1319
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,480
Like all the strength is hundred 
percent.

1320
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,430
It's,
it's uh,

1321
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:05,483
they're,
they're doing it a lot on pro athletes 

1322
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:08,004
now.
There's a lot of athletes that are 

1323
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:10,500
getting it done.
Whereas,

1324
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:11,490
um,
you know,

1325
00:56:11,491 --> 00:56:12,324
there's very little way to get certain 
areas to heal without taking me just 

1326
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:18,350
massive amounts of time off or surgery,
you know.

1327
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,030
But when you're talking about like 
you're kind of injury,

1328
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,980
I mean that's just par for the right 
with

1329
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,761
your business.
I mean,

1330
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:25,380
yeah.
I mean,

1331
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,520
uh,
everything that live in my own,

1332
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,090
all my joints hurt.
My elbows are sort of shit right now.

1333
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,013
My,
uh,

1334
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,173
uncle's herb man,
which of course my chest still hurts 

1335
00:56:34,961 --> 00:56:37,060
from that last man standing tournament 
that I had a couple of years ago.

1336
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:40,780
My neck gets a chest hurts.
You had to pick a broken sternum,

1337
00:56:40,781 --> 00:56:41,261
right?
Yeah.

1338
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:42,490
Well,
I don't know what I said.

1339
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:43,270
It was like,
uh,

1340
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,280
did you ever get an Mri?
I got an MRI,

1341
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:46,114
did injections.
I did all kinds of stuff that they have 

1342
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:48,601
this,
I still have this,

1343
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:49,840
uh,
I have a,

1344
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,363
I guess like a Hematoma that's in 
between the rib cartilage or something 

1345
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:56,410
and it swells out all the time.
It's still swollen.

1346
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:58,660
And he was like a golf ball right there.
Oh,

1347
00:56:58,720 --> 00:56:59,480
she might,
if I,

1348
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,313
it would get so bad that it would swell 
up like a fucking tennis ball and then 

1349
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:07,450
that would pinch off all the nerves 
running down my arm.

1350
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,280
No.
Terrific.

1351
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,500
Be All fucked up.
And the only way to fix that,

1352
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:12,340
it's probably to open you up like a 
fish.

1353
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,200
I,
I'm not that out.

1354
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,990
Hope it doesn't come back.
Be Proofing on the daily,

1355
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:18,790
he's a,
is that what you taken?

1356
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:19,930
Yup,
pretty much all the time.

1357
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:22,990
You know what man,
I had a friend or I have a friend,

1358
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:25,570
um,
who's a ultra marathon runner and he was

1359
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:28,720
taking Ibuprofen every morning and he 
was also taking it at night.

1360
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,280
You're taking 800 milligrams in the 
morning,

1361
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:34,390
800 milligrams at night.
And then I had this woman on who's a,

1362
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:35,320
a doctor,
doctor,

1363
00:57:35,321 --> 00:57:37,780
Rhonda Patrick.
She's a clinical researcher.

1364
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:41,620
And she was talking about the dangers of
nonsteroidal antiinflammatories.

1365
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,650
They cause high blood pressure.
They can cause strokes and some people,

1366
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:46,360
especially when you're using them on a 
daily basis,

1367
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,240
she's like,
there was a lot of people that are using

1368
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:51,460
nonsteroidal anti inflammatories and it 
actually,

1369
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:52,294
there's,
there's a fucked up loop that's going 

1370
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:53,750
on.

1371
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,583
This is the loop.
When you take nonsteroidal anti 

1372
00:57:57,011 --> 00:57:59,410
inflammatories,
it actually causes,

1373
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,970
it causes inflammation because it fucks 
with the gut flora in your body,

1374
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:05,470
especially if you take it on a regular 
basis,

1375
00:58:05,471 --> 00:58:06,304
which in turns causes inflammation,
which you're taking nonsteroidal anti 

1376
00:58:09,761 --> 00:58:11,830
inflammatories to deal with the 
inflammation.

1377
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,230
So the,
the pills that you're taking a deal with

1378
00:58:14,231 --> 00:58:17,140
joint pains sometimes are causing joint 
pain.

1379
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,870
And that's what my friend Cam Haynes,
he was,

1380
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,690
he was running a half a marathon every 
day.

1381
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,760
He still is running.
He's cause he's gearing up for this,

1382
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:26,110
uh,
big foot 200.

1383
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,080
That's in August.
He's going to run 200 miles in 48 hours.

1384
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,880
He ran 24 hours.
Uh,

1385
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,650
last weekend he ran 102 miles to gear up
for it too,

1386
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:38,080
but he got off the Ibuprofen after that 
podcast and he goes,

1387
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,700
I've never felt better.
He goes,

1388
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:40,534
it's amazing.
He's all the aches and pains that I was 

1389
00:58:41,801 --> 00:58:43,120
taking Ibuprofen for.

1390
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,020
They all went away.
And so,

1391
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,200
so what does it take for them?
It's not taking shit.

1392
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,050
He's not taking shit.
It is eating healthy.

1393
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:52,660
He saw his eating healthy.
Ah,

1394
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,570
fuck.
Fuck how bad you eat.

1395
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,250
Uh,
not that bad.

1396
00:58:57,550 --> 00:58:58,840
Not that bad.
Come on Joe,

1397
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:00,880
you already there.
Could we just stop with the cigarettes?

1398
00:59:00,881 --> 00:59:03,130
I tell you this because I love you man.
I'm just trying to help you out.

1399
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:04,750
Not only that,
but I have a,

1400
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:05,880
um,
officially of lily.

1401
00:59:05,881 --> 00:59:06,714
I have a,
uh,

1402
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,040
a food prep sponsor that could be really
good.

1403
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:13,000
I saw that on your instagram that looked
super healthy.

1404
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,310
You get all those pre prep meals.
That makes it easy.

1405
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:16,210
Huh?
It's so good.

1406
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,270
So it's a hot sauce.
All I need,

1407
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:19,870
45 minute,
45,

1408
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:20,704
and the microwave and a nice,
so you get it like every week you get 

1409
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:24,330

1410
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:27,800
oh my fight camps he gives me like a,
every week I would go and pick them up.

1411
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,480
That's how do people get Ahold of this 
guy?

1412
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:31,560
Where like is it a website one?
Uh,

1413
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,280

or on instagram.

1414
00:59:34,281 --> 00:59:37,970
It's a chef roble chef route the meal

1416
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:41,450

00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:45,110
Yeah,
there's a lot of those guys.

1419
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:45,944
A lot of MMA fighters have those little 
sponsors that that do that guy that 

1420
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:50,090
makes a big difference.
So good.

1421
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,730
Healthy foods.
So fucking important.

1422
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:56,330
It's like [inaudible] of course.
But you really are what?

1423
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:57,630
Cheat man.
I mean it's like,

1424
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,513
it sounds so cliche.
We don't think about it because food 

1425
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:01,634
tastes good and if I have,
what's it going to hurt if I have a 

1426
01:00:03,411 --> 01:00:04,244
fucking cookie?
Your body's made out of everything you 

1427
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:08,450
put in it.
If you eat cookies all the time,

1428
01:00:08,451 --> 01:00:10,040
you fuck you become a cookie.

1429
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:15,260
He become the product of all the 
bullshit,

1430
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:18,170
non nutritional food that you stuff and 
your fat face.

1431
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,190
Yeah,
he's got a like grass fed beef and bison

1432
01:00:22,191 --> 01:00:24,440
and fucking all the good stuff.
So it's good.

1433
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:25,400
Nice.
That's nice.

1434
01:00:25,401 --> 01:00:27,510
Do you take supplements?
You take like vitamins,

1435
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:30,680
everything on the on it sends me.
So that's been good.

1436
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,560
I'm addicted to off of right now.
Like if I don't take off her brain,

1437
01:00:33,561 --> 01:00:35,270
I'm just like,
why am I so dumb today?

1438
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:36,283
It's like a counselor you'd be on here.
So I never used to take it before 

1439
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:40,220
workouts,
but now I take it before workouts.

1440
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,980
I've found that it's easy cause I was 
thinking,

1441
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:44,030
well that doesn't have anything to do 
like mental energy,

1442
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:45,560
but it has a,
it has a lot to do,

1443
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:48,440
especially when you're fatigued,
like mental energy.

1444
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,260
Like I find that my workouts have more 
energy.

1445
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,350
When I take Alpha brain and I take 
shroom tech together,

1446
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:58,030
I stack them and a Abra said that's what
like all the pro athletes are doing,

1447
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,120
like football players and shit.
They stack them up.

1448
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:01,663
It was all,
there's a lot of good stuff today that 

1449
01:01:03,171 --> 01:01:04,540
you could find that,
that,

1450
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,570
that really does help you.
Um,

1451
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,280
uh,
non,

1452
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,113
uh,
or rather essential fatty acids are a 

1453
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:13,640
big one that's like,
I think that's almost not negotiable.

1454
01:01:13,641 --> 01:01:14,474
I think you need essential fatty acids.
I think you need fish oils at giant 

1455
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:18,141
Sabal,
man.

1456
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,870
I think it's so important.
So important for your joints.

1457
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:21,704
It's important for your brain's 
important for the development of a 

1458
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:28,310
healthy muscle so that the official,
it makes a big difference to me.

1459
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,460
And then also anti-inflammation stuff 
like crew,

1460
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,010
curcumin,
I guess you say it.

1461
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:35,600
That's anything which is a,
comes from tumeric.

1462
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,590
That's a big one.
Tube.

1463
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:37,503
Yeah.
You know all these natural 

1464
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,670
anti-inflammatories that are not bad for
you.

1465
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,123
Yeah.
I could see the gut flora problem with 

1466
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:48,950
the,
from Ibuprofen.

1467
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,750
It's a big deal.
Stomach's always fucked up.

1468
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,673
Yeah man.
It's bad for taking Ibuprofen about 600 

1469
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,980
milligrams twice a day for dude.
It's like,

1470
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:00,620
I remember he got to stop.
Can we get you to stop?

1471
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:02,990
Can I get you to stop all these things?
Is it possible?

1472
01:02:02,991 --> 01:02:03,890
Can I help you?
Sure.

1473
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:04,724
Man.
They might have body stop hurting you 

1474
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,490
fucking do it.
Well,

1475
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:09,380
how much time do you have off now 
between fights?

1476
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,270
I got,
I probably got some time now,

1477
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:13,880
probably three or four months I think.
So.

1478
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:15,530
Do you have anything scheduled or you 
do?

1479
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,290
I think my next one's to September and 
I'm hungry,

1480
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,260
I think.
Oh,

1481
01:02:19,261 --> 01:02:20,960
okay.
So they have something that this getting

1482
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:22,230
this a military event as well.

1483
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,970
Oh,
so Bella towards going international?

1484
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,833
Yes sir.
How many international events that they 

1485
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:27,120
had?
I know they had a London one.

1486
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:28,050
Right.
Um,

1487
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,440
they hadn't lend one.
They had the,

1488
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,170
their first belt where kickboxing event 
was in Italy.

1489
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:36,890
Uh,
part of it that was Italy.

1490
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:37,973
I still a couple months ago.
Then they have hungry and then again in 

1491
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,690
December is a Florence,
so.

1492
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:43,501
Oh,
nice.

1493
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:44,281
Cool.
Yeah.

1494
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:47,220
Gloria had fights all over the,
all over the world,

1495
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:48,054
but I was always like the American guy,
so it was always like a la carte or the 

1496
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:50,850
American cards.
Right.

1497
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,013
It's really cool that a Delaware is 
going to have me see in the world a 

1498
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:55,320
little bit.
That's beautiful.

1499
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:57,300
You had like a falling out with glory,
Huh?

1500
01:02:57,810 --> 01:02:58,920
Yeah,
we uh,

1501
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,660
we just went our separate ways,
you know.

1502
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:01,860
But you were saying that they were 
taught,

1503
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:04,500
they were telling the commentators to 
talk shit about you.

1504
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,813
Um,
is that a speculation or is that I 

1505
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,240
don't,
I hm.

1506
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,453
Can't talk about it.
I think it was asked nicely not to talk 

1507
01:03:13,801 --> 01:03:15,320
about anymore.
What did you say?

1508
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:16,680
You know,
what did you think?

1509
01:03:16,681 --> 01:03:19,490
Watching my fight with Gloria.
Did you think the commentators were,

1510
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:24,150
but it was your opinion on the date.
It's seat commentating.

1511
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:26,220
He's interesting because,
uh,

1512
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,050
being uh,
someone who's done it before,

1513
01:03:28,051 --> 01:03:31,350
there are things that you see on 
television when you're watching it.

1514
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:32,213
Honestly,
the best view in the house is your 

1515
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:36,960
house.
Cause the best view when you're watching

1516
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:37,794
fights because when you're watching 
kickboxing or whether you're watching 

1517
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:43,080
mma,
when you're watching on television,

1518
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,063
you're seeing it like inside the cage 
and inside the ring and you've seen it 

1519
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:48,804
from the right angle.
Like there's a lot of times when I'm 

1520
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:52,410
watching a fight,
first of all,

1521
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:53,850
I have the best seat in the house.

1522
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:54,683
You can't get any better.
I'm touching the actual ground that the 

1523
01:03:57,391 --> 01:03:58,620
people are fighting on.
It's in front of me.

1524
01:03:58,621 --> 01:04:00,960
There's a table and then right in front 
of that I could reach out,

1525
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,120
but I can touch the cage.
Okay.

1526
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,530
So he can't get any closer.
I miss a lot of shit and I may watch it.

1527
01:04:05,531 --> 01:04:07,560
Is there a screen for you to watch?
Two screens,

1528
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:08,783
but I like to watch the fight.
I want to watch the actual fight and 

1529
01:04:11,311 --> 01:04:12,600
win.
The fight is playing in front of me.

1530
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,990
It's like I'm looking up and then I'm 
looking down at the screen.

1531
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:17,340
I'm looking up and then when we get down
the screen,

1532
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:19,320
and sometimes I have to do commentary 
when I'm down in the screen,

1533
01:04:19,321 --> 01:04:23,190
but I want to watch the actual action 
playing out.

1534
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:27,300
And when that is going on,
sometimes you don't see everything,

1535
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:28,134
but I feel like there's some subtleties 
that you see when you're looking at a 

1536
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:32,274
guy.

1537
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:34,980
There's some things that you see in 
movement where your brain,

1538
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,043
yeah,
I got to think that all the years of 

1539
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:40,740
watching martial arts and doing martial 
arts,

1540
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:45,390
my brain's chunked a bunch of 
information and I s I see certain traits

1541
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,493
and I see trends and I see things and 
you see them when you're actually 

1542
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:52,820
looking at the person's body better than
you do if you're looking at a monitor,

1543
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:53,663
a video representation of it.
But like there's sometimes the refs in 

1544
01:04:57,751 --> 01:04:58,584
the way,
and I don't see what's going on like 

1545
01:05:00,141 --> 01:05:00,660
the,
the,

1546
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,493
the refs here and there right behind the
RAF and so I might miss something or 

1547
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,010
their back is to me and they get hit 
with an upper cut.

1548
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:07,013
You don't see what they get hit with.
There's a lot of times you miss a few 

1549
01:05:09,301 --> 01:05:12,480
things.
So that taking that into consideration,

1550
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:16,020
I know that these guys were sitting 
ringside and they're watching it through

1551
01:05:16,021 --> 01:05:18,760
the ropes and they're seeing it live and
sometimes you don't catch anything.

1552
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,833
But I did think that the commentary was 
a little one sided and I did think that 

1553
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:24,724
they,
there was a lot of things that you were 

1554
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:26,284
doing that they weren't either picking 
up on or they weren't giving you credit 

1555
01:05:28,901 --> 01:05:30,210
for.
And uh,

1556
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:34,360
it all fairness you told me about that 
before I saw the fight,

1557
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:35,493
you know,
and so I saw the fight and I was 

1558
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:36,730
watching.
I was like,

1559
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,241
wow,
that is,

1560
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:38,074
this is,
um,

1561
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,240
it's interesting way there.
They're talking about this fight.

1562
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,710
You were right.
Like it was,

1563
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,450
I mean you,
you put it in my head then I watched it,

1564
01:05:43,451 --> 01:05:46,480
but I tried to be as objective as 
possible.

1565
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:47,343
But yeah,
I didn't think they were giving you 

1566
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,480
credit for a lot of the shit you were 
doing.

1567
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:50,831
Yeah.
I just thought that,

1568
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:52,640
um,
the way that I've a few

1569
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:54,360
that is possible,
man,

1570
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:57,200
no one's ever done that in the UFC.
No one's ever come up to me and said,

1571
01:05:57,201 --> 01:05:58,820
hey,
hype this guy up or hey,

1572
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:01,340
talk shit about this guy.
It's never happened ever.

1573
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,383
But that's the UFC I could tough.
I definitely see it possibly happening 

1574
01:06:06,471 --> 01:06:08,780
in other organizations.
If you felt that,

1575
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:10,541
I just thought that,
uh,

1576
01:06:10,541 --> 01:06:11,374
the way that I was talked about in 
general had changed dramatically of 

1577
01:06:13,741 --> 01:06:14,380
when,
uh,

1578
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,570
in the last couple of fights,
that was what was weird.

1579
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:18,880
Earl Hawaiian,
he came up to me and said the same thing

1580
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:21,310
last time I saw him was like,
well they serve,

1581
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:22,870
talked about you really different now

1582
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:27,410
maybe hearing really had an inside mall,
maybe at a mole inside fucking Gloria as

1583
01:06:27,411 --> 01:06:28,140
well.
But you know,

1584
01:06:28,140 --> 01:06:28,973
it is what it is.

1585
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,070
You know,
Gloria,

1586
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:32,290
I do,
I was doing a lot for this sport,

1587
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:34,370
um,
in this country and worldwide.

1588
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,030
I,
you know,

1589
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,500
they certainly are.
I wish them the best.

1590
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,820
Yeah,
I and I do too.

1591
01:06:37,821 --> 01:06:39,380
I'm a big fan,
but you know,

1592
01:06:39,381 --> 01:06:43,340
they were doing weird shit like on your 
bio instead of all your accomplishments,

1593
01:06:43,341 --> 01:06:44,930
95 professional fights,
all that.

1594
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:45,793
No,
it was like kicked out of his house and 

1595
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:49,670
he was 17 fucking loser,
you know,

1596
01:06:49,671 --> 01:06:51,800
a forced to go to four different high 
schools.

1597
01:06:51,860 --> 01:06:53,570
Everybody hated him.
His feet smell.

1598
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,710
It was like,
I was like,

1599
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,300
is like a rap sheet.
Yeah,

1600
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,180
they were definitely painting you out to
be.

1601
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:05,030
But that's also in their defense.
I mean,

1602
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:07,700
they're trying to develop personalities 
for people tuned into,

1603
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:08,683
you know,
here's this guy who comes out with 

1604
01:07:09,261 --> 01:07:12,560
fucking prison pants on with la on them.
You know,

1605
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,000
it's,
I guess,

1606
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,103
I mean I wouldn't to live well,
I develop or promote the fact that he 

1607
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:21,200
was the first American to ever win a 
global combat tournament or a three time

1608
01:07:21,201 --> 01:07:24,710
world champion or holds the record for 
the fastest knockout of the down sports.

1609
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:26,600
You know,
why promoting those accomplishments.

1610
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:27,560
No,
that's not important.

1611
01:07:27,561 --> 01:07:29,270
I want to know how many times you kicked
out of school.

1612
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:30,163
Yeah.
How old when you were so old you were 

1613
01:07:31,371 --> 01:07:32,204
when your,
when your mom kicked you out of that 

1614
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:35,150
family home and yeah.
Yeah.

1615
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,133
That's what I want to hear about odd 
jobs that you worked on your tough man 

1616
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:39,530
contest.
Well,

1617
01:07:39,531 --> 01:07:40,880
in um,
bell tours,

1618
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:41,840
not defense,

1619
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,561
but in,
in,

1620
01:07:42,561 --> 01:07:43,810
um,
in,

1621
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:47,540
to their credit they did a great job 
with that piece they did on you.

1622
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,001
Yeah.
I really,

1623
01:07:48,001 --> 01:07:49,420
that was a,
I was really proud of that.

1624
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:50,290
You know,
it was cool to,

1625
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,710
uh,
you know,

1626
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:55,050
when you're in it,
you don't really realize what you've,

1627
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:56,500
you've actually done.
But um,

1628
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:57,870
you know what we've,
what I think I've,

1629
01:07:57,871 --> 01:07:58,704
I've been a part of for can't stop with,
can't stop crazy for the sport and the 

1630
01:08:01,061 --> 01:08:05,230
growth in the sport here in this country
from lion fight to glory to now belts or

1631
01:08:05,231 --> 01:08:07,930
kickboxing and being where I am.
Um,

1632
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,090
the weight is on my shoulders,
so to speak,

1633
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:15,091
with pushing this new brand and showing 
Kyla we'll kickboxing into the world,

1634
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:16,160
putting on exciting

1635
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:16,810
fights is,
uh,

1636
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,580
you know,
was proud it was,

1637
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:18,413
which is why we got to get you off the 
fucking Ibuprofen and get you off the 

1638
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:23,260
cigarettes.
Trust me.

1639
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:24,110
The cigarettes.
Yeah.

1640
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,410
The ibuprofen is like a necessity.
No,

1641
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:26,761
no,
no,

1642
01:08:26,761 --> 01:08:27,140
no,
no.

1643
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,690
You think it's a necessity.
You think it's a necessity?

1644
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:30,524
I'm telling you,
I think that there's a real possibility 

1645
01:08:32,991 --> 01:08:33,824
that the inflammation that's being 
caused by taking this stuff and fucking 

1646
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:37,784
with your gut flora is actually making 
your joints hurt even more than they 

1647
01:08:41,031 --> 01:08:43,250
would have normally.
I think it's very possible.

1648
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,510
I think a lemon,
did you,

1649
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,780
do you have the a on it?
Total gut health?

1650
01:08:47,781 --> 01:08:50,390
Are you taking night yet?
I don't know.

1651
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,560
Probiotics.
It's a new,

1652
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:54,320
it's a new of the Krill oil.
Okay.

1653
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:56,030
Something that's different.
That's good too.

1654
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:59,090
That's a essential fatty acids.
It's essentially,

1655
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:02,540
it's a more potent form of fish oil or 
more bioavailable.

1656
01:09:02,690 --> 01:09:04,790
Have a really good bioavailable form I 
should say.

1657
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:06,470
Cause even regular official is 
excellent.

1658
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:10,610
Um,
but this total gut health is different.

1659
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:14,510
Probiotics and enzymes that is really 
good for digesting food,

1660
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:19,220
the enzymes and also absorbing nutrients
through your food with the enzymes.

1661
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:22,310
But the probiotic aspect of it is very 
important.

1662
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:25,940
I've been big on probiotics lately.
I eat a lot of Kimchi,

1663
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:28,490
you know.
Do you like that stuff like spicy Korean

1664
01:09:28,491 --> 01:09:29,600
cabbage?
I love that shit.

1665
01:09:29,601 --> 01:09:32,300
I eat a lot of that.
I eat a lot of raw sauerkraut,

1666
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:34,580
been eaten a lot of that.
I drink a lot of Kombucha.

1667
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,200
That's good too.
That's real good.

1668
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:38,630
Yeah,
I love that stuff.

1669
01:09:38,631 --> 01:09:40,030
I love that gts,
Kombucha,

1670
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,870
the stuff that you have to have a an ID 
to buy cause it's,

1671
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:45,230
yeah,
we have that shit to here,

1672
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,400
Jamie.
We have some pasta out,

1673
01:09:47,401 --> 01:09:48,830
two bottles from me and Joe Schilling.

1674
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:50,943
Um,
but this stuff is more than one half of 

1675
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:56,090
1% alcohol.
So you have to have a license,

1676
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:56,924
a driver's license.
He has to show your 21 to drink 

1677
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,370
Kombucha,
which is predictable.

1678
01:10:00,371 --> 01:10:02,810
It's stupid.
And I also buy this stuff at Erewhon.

1679
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:05,270
That's a,
you take a shot of it every day.

1680
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:10,220
It's like super fucking fermented 
cabbage with Cayenne pepper in it.

1681
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,143
It's like,
whoa.

1682
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,630
He would take his like raw,
but it's super good.

1683
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:15,493
How was it Joe Wa and I'm Keifer.
I've been drinking a lot of key for our 

1684
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:21,540
drink.
A big glass of the out a day.

1685
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,390
Yeah.
Goats milk.

1686
01:10:23,391 --> 01:10:28,130
I take goat's milk keifer.
She's like a super powerful form of like

1687
01:10:28,131 --> 01:10:30,530
Acidophilus,
like coat cultures.

1688
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:35,480
But what I've found over the last year,
year and a half from,

1689
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,480
Oh yeah,
look at that thing.

1690
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:41,060
It's like we're drinking beers here.
This is my favorite flavor.

1691
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:44,150
This is a gingerade what it is,
it's what's called,

1692
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,703
yeah.
Gingerade gingerade organic raw gts 

1693
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:51,350
class.
You got to get the classic,

1694
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:52,453
the classic has the Black Label,
the black labels to let you know it's 

1695
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:59,900
fucking dangerous.
So one half of 1% less alcohol.

1696
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:01,610
Cheers.
Cheers Buddy.

1697
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:03,733
I love this stuff.

1698
01:11:06,230 --> 01:11:08,390
But anyway,
gut health,

1699
01:11:08,810 --> 01:11:10,580
probiotics,
just fucking,

1700
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,550
it's everything man.
So important,

1701
01:11:12,551 --> 01:11:14,100
so important.
Your immune system.

1702
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,700
So important for everything.
So even though your mood,

1703
01:11:17,701 --> 01:11:20,780
they think your personality is partially
shaped by your thoughts before.

1704
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,090
That's great too.
Yeah.

1705
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,253
And uh,
you know,

1706
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,780
just five htp folks.
I mean that's what it is.

1707
01:11:27,781 --> 01:11:29,160
Five htp.
But you know,

1708
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:29,994
a new moon has um,
l Tryptofan also which converts to five 

1709
01:11:33,271 --> 01:11:35,400
htp,
which converts the Serotonin.

1710
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:37,740
So you get sort of a time release 
method,

1711
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,930
a time release effect,
but all that stuff is very good for your

1712
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:40,770
brain.
There's other,

1713
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,920
all the building blocks for human neuro 
transmitters.

1714
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,020
That's what Alpha brain is.
That's a new moon is,

1715
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,360
but new mood specifically,
uh,

1716
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,010
as the building blocks for Sarah telling
him,

1717
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:51,510
right.
All that stuff's legit.

1718
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:54,900
They even tell people that are on Ssri 
is to not take five htp,

1719
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:56,893
um,
serotonin uptake re and habitaters 

1720
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,193
antidepressants.

1721
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:03,463
You know,
things like,

1722
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:04,373
I guess he tell him not to take it 
because then you can get what's called 

1723
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:12,501
Serotonin Syndrome or your body has too 
much serotonin in it and sort of like a,

1724
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:15,150
when guys are on steroids and they get 
bitched,

1725
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:18,030
it's same thing.
It's like your body is like,

1726
01:12:18,031 --> 01:12:20,220
what is all this fucking Serotonin doing
it here?

1727
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:23,310
It's creates an imbalance.
They just,

1728
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,960
they just don't work with each other.
Well,

1729
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:29,560
a Neil Brennan friend of mine who's a 
comic was the first guy that I ever met.

1730
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,790
It was on a five htp and then when he 
got on Ssri,

1731
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,690
they told him to get off the five htp 
and like,

1732
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,440
you're taking this too much going on 
here.

1733
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,313
Also the antidepressants,
that's what they do is they create 

1734
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,780
serotonin.
I do.

1735
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,160
Well,
it helps.

1736
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:44,721
It,
it,

1737
01:12:44,721 --> 01:12:45,554
it,
it helps your body establish a better 

1738
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:48,780
mood.

1739
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:51,690
And I don't know exactly what the Mac,
it's been described to me,

1740
01:12:51,691 --> 01:12:52,940
but I can't really,
uh,

1741
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:55,140
recite it off memory.
But,

1742
01:12:55,141 --> 01:12:55,974
um,
Serotonin and obviously is a big factor 

1743
01:12:57,961 --> 01:13:01,860
in the way you feel growing up and 
taking things like new mood.

1744
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:03,570
You know,
especially like athletes,

1745
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:05,130
like you,
fighters,

1746
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,730
you're constantly draining yourself.
I mean you are just,

1747
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:09,743
I mean I've seen your workouts dude,
you just fucking empty it all out and 

1748
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:14,820
your body's just like boom,
it's done.

1749
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:18,480
And then you have to regear up so your 
body has to produce everything again.

1750
01:13:18,481 --> 01:13:19,314
Your endocrine system is taxed,
everything is taxed and you have to get 

1751
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:25,440
all the right food in it.
That's why fucking with any of that,

1752
01:13:25,441 --> 01:13:29,430
like taking the Ibuprofen,
fucking cigarettes,

1753
01:13:29,431 --> 01:13:31,320
shitty food,
all that stuff is like,

1754
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:35,100
it has a massive effect on someone who 
does something that you do.

1755
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,990
Like you need every edge you can get.
Man.

1756
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,670
You know,
you're in a,

1757
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:39,504
you're in the craziest business that you
can be when it comes to professional 

1758
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:43,494
athletics.
You're in the combat sports business 

1759
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:48,900
here in the business and arguably the 
craziest of the combat sports cause it's

1760
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:50,820
all just throwing bones,
man.

1761
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:52,620
There's no wrestling,
there's no take,

1762
01:13:52,621 --> 01:13:54,720
there's no fucking lay in pray.
There's no hump.

1763
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:55,554
And someone on the ground and holding 
them down and no getting him in the 

1764
01:13:57,091 --> 01:13:58,650
head.
You can't do any of that.

1765
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:00,630
You got to throw bones,
you know,

1766
01:14:00,631 --> 01:14:02,370
that's a,
it's a wild way to make a living.

1767
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,440
You need to all the advantages,
all of them.

1768
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:07,770
I know you were working with a nic curse
on for awhile,

1769
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:12,880
you're going to do that again.
I didn't work with him this last year.

1770
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,820
It was like with Brovana coffin and it 
was just really busy.

1771
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,320
And um,
you know,

1772
01:14:17,321 --> 01:14:18,154
my,
uh,

1773
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:20,560
lately I've been,
you know,

1774
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:22,930
four week notice.
My camps have been really short for both

1775
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:23,913
my last two fights,
so I just hadn't had a chance to work 

1776
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:27,940
with I like,
I think two or three times for this,

1777
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:29,470
uh,
this last fight.

1778
01:14:29,471 --> 01:14:30,160
But yeah,
the guys,

1779
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:30,993
the guy's amazing.
I can't say enough good things about 

1780
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:33,161
him.
Yeah,

1781
01:14:33,161 --> 01:14:35,560
he's a bad motherfucker.
An awesome fucking awesome.

1782
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:37,900
He never so much too,
just so different.

1783
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:38,734
You know,
like when I used to train and do like 

1784
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:42,100
strength conditioning and working on my 
own and stuff,

1785
01:14:42,101 --> 01:14:44,470
it was like by how hard you worked and 
every day it was,

1786
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:46,900
you know,
I've never had a session with,

1787
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,210
with nick where I left and I was like,
oh fuck.

1788
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,780
Like they were always hard and difficult
but like I never,

1789
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,090
they were never like breaking me down,
you know,

1790
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:59,740
the results and the level of the 
increase every week was like really,

1791
01:14:59,741 --> 01:15:01,360
really noticeable and impressive.

1792
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,553
Yeah.
That's the intelligent approach and 

1793
01:15:03,881 --> 01:15:06,820
that's the approach that a lot of 
trainers are using now is they're giving

1794
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:10,240
you enough work so that your body 
improves and recovers,

1795
01:15:10,241 --> 01:15:12,880
but not so much that your body can't 
improve.

1796
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:15,490
So this old stupid idea that a lot of us
have,

1797
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:19,540
and I used the APP just work,
get out of there like you fucking,

1798
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:23,110
you can barely walk.
You got to leave it all in the gym,

1799
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:24,403
but that's not,
that doesn't give you a chance to 

1800
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:26,051
recover.
Right.

1801
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:27,190
And then like rest days,
like,

1802
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:28,440
um,
you know,

1803
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:29,643
not killed.
We used to just crush myself on Monday 

1804
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:32,764
and then the rest of the week I'd be 
dragging ass trying to make it by 

1805
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:36,250
Friday.
Rolled around and was like,

1806
01:15:36,251 --> 01:15:39,430
now your last three workouts a the week 
weren't that productive.

1807
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:40,990
You know what I mean?
Well,

1808
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:41,853
I've been really into that a lot lately 
because I started listening to Wa Pavel 

1809
01:15:45,401 --> 01:15:46,300
Tatsu lean.

1810
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:49,630
He's the guy that brought kettle bells 
to America.

1811
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:52,630
It's this bad ass Russian dude.
And He,

1812
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:53,483
um,
has some really interesting ideas about 

1813
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:56,014
strength and conditioning.
And one of the things that he said that 

1814
01:15:58,841 --> 01:16:03,820
I think is most important is that the 
way you're training,

1815
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:06,070
especially training with kettle bells in
particular,

1816
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,233
what you,
what you're trying to do is you're 

1817
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:13,570
trying to give your body work so that 
your body feels like,

1818
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:15,183
like,
um,

1819
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,750
it can,
it can recover.

1820
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,820
And you slowly build upon these things 
and think of them as a skill.

1821
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:22,923
Like he's like,
strength is a skill and you're not 

1822
01:16:25,511 --> 01:16:26,344
trying to leave yourself completely 
exhausted and blown out and all your 

1823
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:32,680
joints are fried and all your muscles 
are just rubber.

1824
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,650
Like you're trying to what he calls 
grease the groove,

1825
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,400
which means like slowly build this up 
and do it.

1826
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:42,640
Like instead instead of sets of like 25 
wraps,

1827
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:43,750
like crossfit style.

1828
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:46,840
He's like everything more than five reps
is bullshit.

1829
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:49,330
He's like everything more than five reps
is bodybuilding.

1830
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:50,583
He's like,
you should be doing like heavyweight 

1831
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:57,190
five reps and if you can do 10 reps,
do five like you don't need to do,

1832
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,173
you don't need to work to failure.
He doesn't believe in working to 

1833
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:02,380
failure.
I'm doing a bad job of explaining,

1834
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:03,940
uh,
his philosophies,

1835
01:17:03,941 --> 01:17:04,774
but tim,
Tim Ferriss had two podcasts with them 

1836
01:17:07,141 --> 01:17:07,990
where you could listen to it.
It's,

1837
01:17:07,991 --> 01:17:08,860
I'll,
I'll send them to you.

1838
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:09,694
They're excellent.
I think that's kind of similar to like 

1839
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:12,830
the way nick least,
the way that I see nick's training,

1840
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,664
it's like trying to send a neurological 
signal to my body to grow or to change 

1841
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:18,591
it,
to move.

1842
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:20,310
I don't need to like destroy it to do 
that.

1843
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,820
I don't need a breakdown my muscle and 
it has to rebuild itself.

1844
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,010
I need to,
it's like a altitude training.

1845
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:28,890
When you go to high altitude,
your body has picks up a signal that I,

1846
01:17:28,930 --> 01:17:29,763
there's not enough oxygen in this air.
I need to make more red blood cells so 

1847
01:17:32,601 --> 01:17:33,434
your body sends a neuron neurological 
signal to create red blood cells from 

1848
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:37,814
your blue mirror or whatever.
It's your body's like a computer and 

1849
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,240
just trying to get,
okay,

1850
01:17:41,241 --> 01:17:42,980
I want my,
I want to be a little faster,

1851
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:46,460
I want to be a little whatever and I'm 
doing enough work to send that signal to

1852
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,530
make my body adapt.
You know what I mean?

1853
01:17:48,590 --> 01:17:49,423
As opposed to I want to be faster so I'm
going to just destroy my legs until he 

1854
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:54,560
can't walk for a week and then it's 
going to build back faster.

1855
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:55,350
You know what I mean?
A sense.

1856
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:56,750
It does work.
It does.

1857
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,340
Obviously it doesn't work good.

1858
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,383
It doesn't work the right way.
The right way to do it really is to 

1859
01:18:01,601 --> 01:18:02,221
like,
and I've,

1860
01:18:02,221 --> 01:18:03,054
I've been getting great results with 
pebbles methods with doing lighter or 

1861
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:10,730
not lighter weights,
but lower reps,

1862
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,640
lower wraps in like if I could do eight 
or nine reps,

1863
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:14,474
I do five,
I do five and I ended there and like 

1864
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,020
when I'm done,
I feel good.

1865
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:20,000
Like I'm done with my workout.
I know I put in,

1866
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,970
you know,
45 minutes or more of hard work,

1867
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:23,953
but I don't feel like broken down.
Whereas before when I was like sort of 

1868
01:18:27,561 --> 01:18:28,394
structuring it off of my own ideas,
I would just have these fucking brutal 

1869
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:34,940
workouts where I just,
everything was to failure.

1870
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:35,590
Everything is right.

1871
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,550
Ah,

1872
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,070
great.
And then when it was over,

1873
01:18:39,071 --> 01:18:40,960
I just felt like a Zombie for the rest 
of the day.

1874
01:18:40,990 --> 01:18:43,060
Yeah.
And then now your serotonin levels,

1875
01:18:43,061 --> 01:18:44,770
by the time you're three days in,
I'm like,

1876
01:18:44,771 --> 01:18:45,604
fuck,
I need some new move because I don't 

1877
01:18:46,151 --> 01:18:46,984
feel like I want to do this shit anymore
and you're not going to perform as well 

1878
01:18:49,151 --> 01:18:51,610
and you're not gonna you know,
it's a caffeine big thing.

1879
01:18:51,611 --> 01:18:52,444
Yeah.
I was chugging 20 ounce starbucks like 

1880
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:56,110
they were nothing.
I go to sleep,

1881
01:18:56,350 --> 01:19:01,310
I can take a 20 ounce Dar Bucket Watch.
That shit doesn't work anyway at work.

1882
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:02,710
Yeah,
you can,

1883
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:04,840
you can get to the point where your body
is just,

1884
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,400
it doesn't matter.
Stimulants,

1885
01:19:06,401 --> 01:19:07,270
whatever.
You're just,

1886
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,090
you're just toast.
Yeah.

1887
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:10,510
It's,
it's,

1888
01:19:10,510 --> 01:19:12,500
there's a lot of science to,
uh,

1889
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:17,670
athletics to sports training with 
athletes today that just didn't exist 10

1890
01:19:17,981 --> 01:19:20,950
20 years ago and take advantage of that 
heating water right,

1891
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,270
is drink lots of water,
eat lots of red meat that your,

1892
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,180
that was your,
that was your supplement base,

1893
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:25,720
you know?

1894
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:26,740
Yeah.
Nobody knew shit.

1895
01:19:27,370 --> 01:19:28,031
I mean,
eight,

1896
01:19:28,031 --> 01:19:29,200
nine.
Well,

1897
01:19:29,230 --> 01:19:30,580
yeah.
Nobody knew anything about like,

1898
01:19:30,581 --> 01:19:32,050
what's,
what's the proper way to,

1899
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:33,380
to eat?
When should you eat?

1900
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:34,214
You eat five times a day.
Should g there was this warrior diet 

1901
01:19:37,211 --> 01:19:38,044
craze where people were like,
the only eat one meal a day because 

1902
01:19:40,091 --> 01:19:42,370
that's what a road warrior did.
They would only eat once a day.

1903
01:19:42,371 --> 01:19:43,440
And like,
um,

1904
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,490
you're not a warrior.
You're not a viking.

1905
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:47,590
Like you're not a fucking barbarian.
Like,

1906
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:48,880
look,
you got a frigerator.

1907
01:19:48,881 --> 01:19:53,881
It's right there.
How have some neat you fuck like it's,

1908
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:57,850
it's weird because it's fucking fuck you
fuck cock.

1909
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,980
You got damn cukor he had a fucking 
stake.

1910
01:19:59,981 --> 01:20:00,814
You need to come up with our own insult.
Come up with a name that you can call 

1911
01:20:03,521 --> 01:20:06,100
certain types of people.
Well we'll work on that.

1912
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:07,293
That's for time.
But it's interesting that like 

1913
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:09,834
nutritional advice that people would 
give you just 10 years ago isn't valid 

1914
01:20:12,721 --> 01:20:13,140
anymore.

1915
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,300
Oh yeah.
You know the,

1916
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:18,930
the ideas of a absorption of certain 
fats and essential fatty acids that they

1917
01:20:18,931 --> 01:20:19,764
had,
especially plant based stuff just a few 

1918
01:20:20,761 --> 01:20:22,290
years ago.
They're realizing like,

1919
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:24,790
yeah,
this stuff exists in these platforms,

1920
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:29,490
but it's not as bio available as it is 
in an animal forms.

1921
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:32,910
And this is what really recent stuff.
I like the Food Pyramid Shit.

1922
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:33,700
Yeah.
Like that.

1923
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,860
Like it's just,
I was talking about that,

1924
01:20:35,861 --> 01:20:37,640
I guess margarine and butter,
that's better.

1925
01:20:37,641 --> 01:20:39,660
And I can't believe it's not butter,
but now it's not about,

1926
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:40,411
you know,
it's march,

1927
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:42,510
it's fucking terrible for you.
It's plastic.

1928
01:20:42,511 --> 01:20:43,344
It's one molecule away from plastic.
That's what they were telling people to 

1929
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:46,404
do.
You know the Food Pyramid said that you 

1930
01:20:47,941 --> 01:20:50,220
should have like 300 grams of 
carbohydrate today.

1931
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:51,083
Yeah.
You supposed to eat bread and pasta and 

1932
01:20:52,361 --> 01:20:53,071
now they're saying,
no,

1933
01:20:53,071 --> 01:20:53,341
no,
no,

1934
01:20:53,341 --> 01:20:53,850
no.
Dot.

1935
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:57,560
I was reading and then like you get,
Oh yeah,

1936
01:20:57,570 --> 01:20:58,440
stupid cancer.

1937
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,480
Like,
oh they have you cut out all of the shit

1938
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,400
that they've been telling you since 
you're a child.

1939
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:03,363
You're supposed to have,
which the food pyramid was based around 

1940
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:06,750
the economy.
They want,

1941
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:08,303
they need people to buy it,
to buy the fucking oats and grains that 

1942
01:21:11,611 --> 01:21:12,840
we grow here.
You know what I mean?

1943
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,730
Either.
There's a lot of that.

1944
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,110
I mean there's certainly 300 must have 
a,

1945
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,173
must have some influence,
especially with corn subsidies and all 

1946
01:21:20,851 --> 01:21:21,684
that jazz.
Man,

1947
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,270
did you ever see that movie king corn?
No.

1948
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,490
Cheers dude.
Watch that documentary.

1949
01:21:26,491 --> 01:21:28,410
It's crazy.
It's about how much corn,

1950
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:30,750
wheat and how much,
how corn is subsidized.

1951
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,710
Have they paid people to grow corn?
Like the government pays farmers to grow

1952
01:21:34,711 --> 01:21:35,544
corn?
If the government didn't subsidize corn 

1953
01:21:37,201 --> 01:21:38,034
production,
this company corn agricultural like 

1954
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,003
would fucking collapse.
Like there's so many of these people 

1955
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:43,854
that are reliant,
these agricultural farms that are 

1956
01:21:46,441 --> 01:21:49,830
growing corn reliant on government 
subsidies in order to stay afloat.

1957
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,200
It's weird and corns and everything.
Corn,

1958
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,450
I was having beef jerky other day and 
uh,

1959
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,540
my wife was reading the ingredients and 
she goes,

1960
01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:00,060
didn't know this has corn in it.
I don't know why.

1961
01:22:00,150 --> 01:22:02,640
Corn Syrup is one protein.
Everything right?

1962
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:03,450
Corn,
protein,

1963
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,730
corn,
protein in fucking beef jerky.

1964
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:09,570
It's fucking corn heads.
That's a new one.

1965
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:10,580
Corn,
corn,

1966
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:12,970
corn head fucking,
no,

1967
01:22:12,980 --> 01:22:14,070
it's not,
it's not going to work.

1968
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:17,900
But corn,
protein in beef Jerky,

1969
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,153
beef.
The protein that you would think would 

1970
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:21,360
be in the,
yeah,

1971
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:22,203
I'm sure again,
well it must have something to do with 

1972
01:22:23,161 --> 01:22:26,340
the flavoring or something to do with 
the sauce that they,

1973
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,174
you know,
they marinate them and Teriyaki or 

1974
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:30,030
whatever the fuck they do when they make
it.

1975
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:34,200
But there was corn protein in beef 
jerky.

1976
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:37,090
How much is beef jerky?
You've seen it all now in jail.

1977
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,790
I have seen it all too.

1978
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:40,740
So,
um,

1979
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:44,130
so what's the plan now when you,
when you come off of a fight like that?

1980
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,233
What'd he do?
He just chillax for a little bit and 

1981
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:47,244
just,
yeah,

1982
01:22:47,310 --> 01:22:49,840
I had two back to back fights anyway.
And uh,

1983
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,073
and I'm looking forward to,
I was a little time off for relaxing a 

1984
01:22:53,311 --> 01:22:54,144
little bit,
getting my mind wrapped around what 

1985
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:57,060
happened,
why it happened,

1986
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:57,923
where I go from there.
And do you move around your training 

1987
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:01,560
camps at all?
Do you bring in new trainers?

1988
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,493
Do you ever go to places and spend a 
little bit of time working with someone 

1989
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:05,890
different?
I'm numb.

1990
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,813
I'm sure I'll be up in stockton,
a Latin hoping an acre ready for his 

1991
01:23:09,041 --> 01:23:11,230
fight with conor now and then,
um,

1992
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:12,363
yeah,
it's always good to work with those 

1993
01:23:12,671 --> 01:23:13,420
guys.
And uh,

1994
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:16,360
I want to get some boxing rounds in with
Richard Perez when I'm up there.

1995
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:17,720
So Nice.
Um,

1996
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:19,330
not a lot,
you know.

1997
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:20,500
Uh,
I try to,

1998
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:20,951
you know,
my,

1999
01:23:20,951 --> 01:23:23,700
I think my team is really solid and,
and uh,

2000
01:23:23,770 --> 01:23:24,603
I think that's where I need to be.
I was at American top team is a little 

2001
01:23:26,980 --> 01:23:27,813
before when the sock,
he got nine mail the first time it was 

2002
01:23:29,601 --> 01:23:31,390
an American top team working on my 
wrestling and stuff.

2003
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,880
And then was,
it was,

2004
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,840
it was a cool experience.
I don't think it was the best experience

2005
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:39,540
from just being away from my sports 
system of my coaches and my team.

2006
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,473
And I don't think,
I think that was a mistake to to jump 

2007
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:45,220
ship,
so to speak and go train someplace else.

2008
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:46,473
Yeah.
It seems to me that there's a lot of 

2009
01:23:47,111 --> 01:23:51,130
comforts of home that help relax you and
just being in the,

2010
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:54,970
in the same environment all the time.
It's probably real good for you in terms

2011
01:23:54,971 --> 01:23:58,390
of like your comfort level recovery and 
being in your own home.

2012
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,463
Yeah.
And I think just your coaches and being 

2013
01:24:00,941 --> 01:24:03,280
with somebody that's you for 10 years 
and he knows what you're thinking,

2014
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:05,020
you know what he thinks,
he knows how you are,

2015
01:24:05,021 --> 01:24:06,670
what you need to hear,
how hard to work,

2016
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:07,530
do things like that,
you know?

2017
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:09,160
Right.
Knows when you're tired,

2018
01:24:09,161 --> 01:24:11,320
when you're off,
you have a good understanding of you.

2019
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,570
Yeah.
And I think I liked the fact that you've

2020
01:24:13,571 --> 01:24:14,404
gone away from the MMA and decided to go
straight back to kickboxing cause you 

2021
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:19,480
know what do you 32 now?
Yup.

2022
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,680
Yeah.
I mean it's just like,

2023
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:23,800
it's not,
you're so good at kickboxing.

2024
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:25,060
It's such a,
you know,

2025
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:25,894
it's such an emerging sport too.
And with this opportunity with Bella 

2026
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:29,644
tour too,
I think it's a really good idea because 

2027
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:35,440
like learning all the wrestling and 
learning all the fucking submissions and

2028
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:37,510
take down defense and all that stuff,
just,

2029
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:39,670
it's a whole nother experience.

2030
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:42,330
A whole nother like journey to get on.
Yup.

2031
01:24:42,780 --> 01:24:43,660
It's a,
and it's,

2032
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,553
I think it's too late for that.
It'd be like if I went into a boxing 

2033
01:24:46,451 --> 01:24:47,590
career now,
you know what I mean?

2034
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:49,240
You just,
you can,

2035
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:50,950
you can throw and you can take some 
shots,

2036
01:24:50,951 --> 01:24:54,190
but like you don't have 150 amateur 
boxing fights,

2037
01:24:54,191 --> 01:24:55,870
you know what I mean?
You're not going to catch up.

2038
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:57,363
Right.
And your body is programmed to do 

2039
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:01,270
certain things already.
Like you brought your body's program for

2040
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:04,300
certain distances.
Like you buy like kick him.

2041
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:06,360
Oh he can't kick him.
That's what my problem is with him.

2042
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:07,140
It was the,
my,

2043
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,520
my body has been programmed that when 
we're in,

2044
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,280
when we get close to marina and I 
clench,

2045
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:13,930
so to speak,
I pull you into the clinch.

2046
01:25:13,931 --> 01:25:14,621
I get to that.
Well,

2047
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:16,180
when I do that [inaudible] pull you 
right.

2048
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,600
Like you're taken out and I'm like,
it's,

2049
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:22,420
it's so hard for me to think the push 
away,

2050
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:23,323
right.
We need to stop this because everything 

2051
01:25:24,551 --> 01:25:28,180
I've done for the last 17 years of my 
life has been like,

2052
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,190
yeah,
yeah.

2053
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:32,070
No,
you worked with a w.

2054
01:25:32,071 --> 01:25:35,020
What is your trainer's name again?
That Japanese dude mark tomorrow.

2055
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,900
He seems like a really interesting guy.
He's a real cool dude.

2056
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:39,340
And you've been with him for a long 
time,

2057
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:40,450
Huh?
Yeah,

2058
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:43,940
like a 10 years,
11 years background.

2059
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,193
Uh,
he's done almost every martial art I 

2060
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:48,154
think.
And um,

2061
01:25:48,490 --> 01:25:49,330
he kind of like,
oh,

2062
01:25:49,331 --> 01:25:51,190
I didn't,
he did a kito for awhile and the guy was

2063
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:52,110
like,
you know,

2064
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:53,350
you have to go out and be like this.
It's like,

2065
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:54,610
oh,
what if I had I do this?

2066
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:54,861
Like,
no,

2067
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:55,110
no,
no.

2068
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,990
It has to be like that.
He's like,

2069
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:57,040
oh,
fuck this bullshit.

2070
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:57,873
But he,
uh,

2071
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:59,800
you know,
did boxing and kickboxing.

2072
01:25:59,801 --> 01:26:01,120
He was one of the first,
uh,

2073
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:02,553
promoters here in California for Moy Tai
when they used to have the old shows 

2074
01:26:06,231 --> 01:26:08,570
that Hollywood park was what promotions 
I like to meet.

2075
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:11,630
That guy seems like a very wise guy.
Very knowledgeable guy.

2076
01:26:11,720 --> 01:26:12,920
He's good.
He's real good dude.

2077
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,890
Real good dude.
But have you had much experience besides

2078
01:26:15,891 --> 01:26:16,724
American top team working with different
kickboxing trainers or is there anybody 

2079
01:26:19,341 --> 01:26:21,320
that you would really enjoy working 
with?

2080
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,510
Um,
no,

2081
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,670
I haven't had a lot of experience 
outside of working with,

2082
01:26:25,671 --> 01:26:26,870
um,
at Att,

2083
01:26:26,900 --> 01:26:27,740
many,
many att.

2084
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:29,090
It was mostly,
I just words in my wrestling,

2085
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:29,680
wrestling,
wrestling,

2086
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:30,513
wrestling,
um,

2087
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:34,340
have more to the whole lot of other 
kickboxing a trainers.

2088
01:26:34,850 --> 01:26:36,770
Do you think there's benefit in that and
trying out,

2089
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:37,350
uh,
you know,

2090
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:38,183
different Pete,
just having some sessions with some 

2091
01:26:39,471 --> 01:26:41,990
different people just to see if you pick
up a few things.

2092
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:42,820
Oh,
absolutely.

2093
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:44,510
You're like a rob came in or something 
like that.

2094
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,040
Yeah,
I know rob came in.

2095
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,180
He's a buddy of mine,
but we haven't worked together again.

2096
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:49,160
God,
you got to work with them.

2097
01:26:49,161 --> 01:26:51,050
Yeah,
absolutely.

2098
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:52,573
Yeah.
I mean a antony hard docks around here 

2099
01:26:53,991 --> 01:26:54,950
too.
You ever trained with him?

2100
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,560
I'll set it up.
Yeah.

2101
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:57,763
Smart Guy.
He's another guy I think probably help 

2102
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:00,770
you.
It knows a lot of shit.

2103
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,510
I just think um,
you know,

2104
01:27:02,511 --> 01:27:06,260
for a guy like you at your level,
like any little variables that you could

2105
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:08,300
pick up from any of these guys,
it's probably a good thing.

2106
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:10,580
So much,
so much good knowledge.

2107
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:11,743
And Southern California in particular is
such an amazing place for just all 

2108
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:16,800
martial arts.
I mean,

2109
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:19,370
we're like in one of them that,
I mean as far as the United States,

2110
01:27:19,371 --> 01:27:22,240
this is one of the Meccas uh,
Henry Hill.

2111
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:23,630
Yeah.
Love to work with them.

2112
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:24,553
Oh fuck yeah.
We see each other at the fights of know 

2113
01:27:26,211 --> 01:27:27,330
each other well,
but um,

2114
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,393
great guy.
Never had an opportunity to work with 

2115
01:27:29,271 --> 01:27:31,220
them.
He's done the wonder here a lot.

2116
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:32,054
Actually.
I think he's being in northern 

2117
01:27:32,991 --> 01:27:35,530
California quite a bit because he was at
Aka for awhile.

2118
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,010
I think.
What's he doing up there?

2119
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:38,163
I'm not sure.
I think that he was working with Luke 

2120
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:41,660
for the last fight and I think that,
uh,

2121
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,300
think he might be moving out this way.
Oh really?

2122
01:27:44,330 --> 01:27:45,560
When I heard that.
Interesting.

2123
01:27:45,561 --> 01:27:47,170
I don't know how long that blacks 
Lillian's is,

2124
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:49,910
is doing.
Yeah.

2125
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,020
Isn't going under it.
Yeah.

2126
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:55,700
I've got a business or something.
Didn't the owner just declare bankruptcy

2127
01:27:55,701 --> 01:27:58,010
or something along those lines?
I think that's what I,

2128
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:00,420
that's not good.
I don't know.

2129
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:04,230
Cause he owned that owner owned Jocko 
willink too.

2130
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,540
If it's one point.
Yeah.

2131
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,610
I think,
I dunno.

2132
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:10,970
I don't know enough about this study and
probably talk about it.

2133
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,010
I don't either.
I don't know.

2134
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:13,213
I mean,
uh,

2135
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,503
I know Dan Lambert very well,
the guy who owns American top team and 

2136
01:28:16,881 --> 01:28:18,900
that's as legit as it gets.
He's the best.

2137
01:28:18,901 --> 01:28:20,780
So such a great dude.
I love that guy.

2138
01:28:20,781 --> 01:28:22,190
I mean like a superstar when I was 
there.

2139
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,600
Dan Lambert is awesome.
No,

2140
01:28:23,601 --> 01:28:24,434
he is a fucking amazing dude.
And so important for the growth and 

2141
01:28:27,381 --> 01:28:28,214
development of MMA.
I mean what he's done with American top 

2142
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:33,560
team and putting together this world 
class facility,

2143
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:37,340
by the way,
spending millions of dollars to do it.

2144
01:28:37,341 --> 01:28:42,080
Just throwing money at that and having 
guys take advantage of that.

2145
01:28:42,081 --> 01:28:44,150
And he had guys rip him off.
He had a lot,

2146
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:46,190
a lot of like really shitty things 
happen a lot.

2147
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:48,790
And then when the black zillions came 
around,

2148
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,720
a lot of guys bailed because that guy 
paid him.

2149
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,910
He paid people like,
come on over to me,

2150
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,140
I'll give you money.
And you know,

2151
01:28:54,141 --> 01:28:54,974
he just sort of poached a bunch of 
people allegedly according to Dan tells 

2152
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:02,280
the story.
So who knows?

2153
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:04,610
Who knows what the fuck happened.
But at the end of the day,

2154
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:06,240
guy like Dan Lambert,
super important.

2155
01:29:06,241 --> 01:29:07,074
You need like these like wealthy 
benefactors who take these chances and 

2156
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:11,250
put together these facilities.
But in my opinion,

2157
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:14,760
no one's done it like Dan has.
Did it handle a new facility out there?

2158
01:29:14,761 --> 01:29:16,430
I saw him in some,
some pictures online.

2159
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,450
It looks crazy.
Crazy.

2160
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:19,980
It's got apartments.
Yeah,

2161
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:25,270
a huge where's building going on now is 
a lot of people are building dorms.

2162
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,550
Yeah.
Their camps down,

2163
01:29:26,850 --> 01:29:27,683
which makes a lot of senses.
So many guys are bouncing around to 

2164
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:29,963
sure.
You know,

2165
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:30,803
they come from out of town to go train 
and at Greg Jackson's a building one 

2166
01:29:33,571 --> 01:29:34,020
like that.

2167
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:34,690
And uh,
yeah,

2168
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:36,760
Greg Jack Cowboy said he has a bad 
motherfucker.

2169
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,960
Ransoming calloway.
Good Cowboy.

2170
01:29:42,031 --> 01:29:44,160
Look Against Code Tag.
Holy Shit.

2171
01:29:44,161 --> 01:29:46,260
Screaming at the TV.
He looked fucking awesome.

2172
01:29:46,261 --> 01:29:48,330
Sensational.
At one 70.

2173
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:49,164
He looks God damn sensational.
I mean that it's like everything came 

2174
01:29:52,201 --> 01:29:55,350
together at one 70 and coat.
He's a beast man.

2175
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,780
Nope.
Nobody's ever worked coty over the way.

2176
01:29:57,781 --> 01:30:00,510
Cowboy did.
And he's he coattails father like two oh

2177
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,344
five before too.
Right?

2178
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,130
Cause at first he was saying that,
uh,

2179
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:05,603
at one 70,
the guy who was also like a one 55 are 

2180
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:08,550
coming up,
but it was like a new way.

2181
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:10,560
Right?
Who's this first?

2182
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:11,453
Oh,
cowboys.

2183
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,760
Yeah.
Big Dude.

2184
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:16,290
That was that other cowboy dude.
Yeah.

2185
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:18,300
Um,
but that guy is big.

2186
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,410
He's a big fella.
He was bigger than cowboy boots.

2187
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,570
Cowboy.
I caught him in the triangle,

2188
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,790
but he just looked great.
But like Kofi haven body,

2189
01:30:23,791 --> 01:30:24,624
like one 85 and then he started,
his first fight was at two oh five he 

2190
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:28,260
dropped Tito Ortiz.

2191
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,123
This is way back in the day.
It's when Tito was a light heavyweight 

2192
01:30:30,991 --> 01:30:31,824
champ I believe.
And I think Tito was either champ or in 

2193
01:30:36,901 --> 01:30:37,620
the,
I mean it was,

2194
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:38,453
Tito was in his prime and he lost to 
Tito at light heavyweight and then went 

2195
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:44,370
down to one 85 fought Anderson Silva.
I was doing very well,

2196
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:45,233
very smart fight.
He fought a very smart fight against 

2197
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:48,654
Anderson where he was like making 
Anderson lead in Anderson is really a 

2198
01:30:51,331 --> 01:30:52,164
counter guy and he was just sort of 
laying back and Anderson didn't like it 

2199
01:30:54,551 --> 01:30:55,384
and he doesn't,
the Anderson does not like it when he 

2200
01:30:56,401 --> 01:30:59,010
had like a weird knee popped or 
something and then he blew out.

2201
01:30:59,490 --> 01:31:00,323
Yeah.
Were like lifted his leg up to throw a 

2202
01:31:01,051 --> 01:31:01,884
kick and his knee just buckled and 
shaped in on him and shit happens 

2203
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:05,730
sometimes it's,
Oh yeah,

2204
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:08,010
weird freak shit like that happens a lot
in this sport.

2205
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:08,933
Well sure.
And there's also like injuries that you 

2206
01:31:09,961 --> 01:31:12,850
get in like the second and third round 
that you don't even know what goals,

2207
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:14,150
you know,
you felt your knee pop,

2208
01:31:14,151 --> 01:31:14,984
you're not exactly sure what it is and 
you're still standing on and everything 

2209
01:31:17,011 --> 01:31:17,844
seems fine.
And then you throw a kick and it just 

2210
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:21,150
gives out.
There's that,

2211
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:22,523
you know,
but the point is [inaudible] he's a 

2212
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:24,600
stud.
He said,

2213
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:28,020
tough fucking guy.
And to have cowboy work,

2214
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:28,890
I'm like that.
I was like,

2215
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,733
Woo.
Ninja looked fucking aussie like 

2216
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:34,470
terminator that night.
Like he looks like,

2217
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,180
yeah,
it looked like a world,

2218
01:31:36,181 --> 01:31:38,730
but going to happy for me.
Legit world champion.

2219
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,751
Yeah.
Yeah.

2220
01:31:39,751 --> 01:31:41,640
I hope he can keep that together.
I really do.

2221
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,980
I think one 70 I think these guys that 
are fucking dumb,

2222
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,460
depleting themselves so badly to cut 
weight.

2223
01:31:47,820 --> 01:31:49,350
I think that's going to be a thing of 
the past.

2224
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:51,030
I really do.
I think people gotta realize like,

2225
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:54,110
this is not the benefit that you get in 
that is,

2226
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:55,153
it's negligible cowboys weighing like 
one 76 somewhere around that and he's 

2227
01:31:59,200 --> 01:31:59,980
cutting just a little

2228
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,590
bit of weight and making one 70 easy.
Yeah.

2229
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:07,720
I think he was like four or five pounds 
off when he came for zero.

2230
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:11,050
We sparked a couple of weeks before the 
fight and he was like 14 days out and he

2231
01:32:11,051 --> 01:32:11,884
was like five pounds like you'd be out 
to eat where even when everyone nice 

2232
01:32:15,551 --> 01:32:18,790
shit drinking a beer.
He's so fucking ridiculous.

2233
01:32:18,791 --> 01:32:21,700
What that eight drinks beer up until the
day of the weigh ins.

2234
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:25,630
That can't be good.
Right?

2235
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,340
Why?
Well,

2236
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:30,700
a little bit of beer is probably okay.
Well boss route and said that.

2237
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:32,800
He said he used to drink beer.
He said,

2238
01:32:32,801 --> 01:32:34,810
I drink beer every night.
I drink a little bit of beer.

2239
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,760
I have a,
I don't get fucking drunk.

2240
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,320
You drink a little beer when you're in 
camp?

2241
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:42,213
Yeah,
I drink a little beer when I'm in camp 

2242
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:46,070
after the weigh in.
Not ever immediately after the way I am,

2243
01:32:46,071 --> 01:32:49,420
but I'm at and when I'm all fed and 
rehydrated and feeling good,

2244
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:50,980
I'll have a beer.
It's part of mine.

2245
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:53,470
I like to be relaxed,
you know,

2246
01:32:53,530 --> 01:32:56,680
I want to not relax like all I'm going 
to get doing shots,

2247
01:32:56,681 --> 01:32:57,514
you know what I mean?
About the cowboy and I were talking 

2248
01:32:59,381 --> 01:33:02,860
about that too.
It's like they have made the fight week,

2249
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:03,694
so stressful now for everyone.
And then you get so like mentally just 

2250
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,730
stressed out and you can't do this,
you can't do that.

2251
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:13,180
And you got to do these interviews.
And like fight week used to be our whole

2252
01:33:13,181 --> 01:33:13,841
camp.
You know,

2253
01:33:13,841 --> 01:33:14,674
when I first started it was you want to 
fight on Saturday and it's like Monday 

2254
01:33:16,661 --> 01:33:17,261
and like,
okay,

2255
01:33:17,261 --> 01:33:19,270
I'm training all week and then you 
following on Saturday,

2256
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:19,600
you know?

2257
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,320
And uh,
you know,

2258
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:22,173
I think that,
uh,

2259
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:24,730
well what's so stressful about it,
the interviews,

2260
01:33:24,731 --> 01:33:26,660
the press,
the interview is that the,

2261
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:29,890
if you know,
I try not to think about the fight,

2262
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:30,724
you know,
cowboy the same way as we get a little 

2263
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,360
get along well with and stuff like,
um,

2264
01:33:35,200 --> 01:33:37,840
if you sat at home and didn't eat,
you know,

2265
01:33:37,841 --> 01:33:39,550
and you're already tired and you sat at 
home,

2266
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:41,650
the only thing that you can think of is 
on Saturday night,

2267
01:33:41,651 --> 01:33:42,870
this guy's gonna try and kill me and 
blah,

2268
01:33:42,871 --> 01:33:43,101
blah,
blah,

2269
01:33:43,101 --> 01:33:43,934
blah.
And it's like it eats you up and they 

2270
01:33:45,081 --> 01:33:46,850
stresses you the fuck out.
Right.

2271
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:49,600
You know what I mean?
As opposed to like go in and see a movie

2272
01:33:49,601 --> 01:33:51,250
and relaxing,
you know?

2273
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:52,253
And when,
when the thoughts of the fight come up 

2274
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,270
and your head,
you purposely ignore them,

2275
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:56,950
push them aside.
Yeah.

2276
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,650
If they're not helpful,
you know what I mean?

2277
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:00,490
There's something I can't change.
You know what I mean?

2278
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,350
I don't over analyze,
you know?

2279
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:03,323
Right.
So watch my fight my is a million times 

2280
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:06,603
before I bought it.
Now it's like I'll watch them fight and 

2281
01:34:08,071 --> 01:34:08,904
maybe once or twice and see if there's 
anything that jumps out at me that it 

2282
01:34:12,341 --> 01:34:13,174
looked like he does this sometimes.
But other than that turned out to 

2283
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,670
overanalyze it and make it in there.
Just do it now.

2284
01:34:18,671 --> 01:34:20,590
That's,
that's a smart way to do it because it's

2285
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:23,980
like you're doing all the work anyway.
You're doing all the work in the gym.

2286
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:28,030
You're prepared.
Like the mindset needs time off too,

2287
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:29,710
just like the body does.
Absolutely.

2288
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,340
Absolutely.
And you've,

2289
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:33,143
you know,
is cowboy drink and a beard or fight 

2290
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:37,080
week.
And it changed the,

2291
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:37,983
what is body,
what he's done to train for the last 12 

2292
01:34:40,121 --> 01:34:42,700
years of his life.
He's not going to perform because you're

2293
01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:43,541
like,
I don't think so.

2294
01:34:43,541 --> 01:34:44,374
I think being relaxed and being 
confident and comfortable and then 

2295
01:34:47,831 --> 01:34:50,080
getting in there and handling business 
at night,

2296
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:51,670
people start,
well fuck,

2297
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:53,080
is that sound?
I don't like that.

2298
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:55,180
That's what people are saying.
I know what the fucking cock,

2299
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:58,130
so fuck is going on here man.
Um,

2300
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,960
you,
you did some work with vinny shoreman,

2301
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,640
you know,
I've had on the podcast,

2302
01:35:01,641 --> 01:35:03,520
great guy.
And uh,

2303
01:35:03,590 --> 01:35:07,130
before that Vinnie's uh,
he calls himself a mental coach.

2304
01:35:07,131 --> 01:35:09,200
She does hypnosis,
but he calls himself a mental coach.

2305
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,610
And before that I was like,
all right,

2306
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:12,170
well what's the deal with this 
hypnotism?

2307
01:35:12,171 --> 01:35:13,880
Is this,
this is shit legit.

2308
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:16,370
And then he put me under,
I had them do it and I was like,

2309
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:17,570
oh,
should I woke up?

2310
01:35:17,571 --> 01:35:20,500
My pants were gone.
I got to have him do timeline therapy on

2311
01:35:20,501 --> 01:35:21,680
it.
What is that?

2312
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:24,990
Timeline therapy is like a,
it's like a hypnosis state,

2313
01:35:24,991 --> 01:35:27,060
but you're basically,
you know,

2314
01:35:27,061 --> 01:35:31,470
like a timeline and a book.
There's Jesus born whatever,

2315
01:35:31,471 --> 01:35:32,640
World War One,
World War II.

2316
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:34,440
And he kind of like,
did you,

2317
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:37,390
did you feel like you floated up at all 
when you're under?

2318
01:35:37,410 --> 01:35:37,840
No.

2319
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,490
Didn't feel like I floated but I felt 
like I went inward more.

2320
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:44,370
Okay.
I felt like it almost felt like I was on

2321
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:45,680
a drug.
So this one

2322
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,433
you almost like you pull back,
like you pull back and you'll go up and 

2323
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:50,774
go be out of,
that probably sounds so weird to people 

2324
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:54,620
that don't get it,
but fuck them,

2325
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:57,140
you go like straight up,
back into the sky.

2326
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:57,890
Right.
So you're like almost,

2327
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,400
it feels like you're floating to me.
Like,

2328
01:35:59,790 --> 01:36:01,940
like I know what it feels like to fly 
based off of that.

2329
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:03,320
And you go up,
up,

2330
01:36:03,321 --> 01:36:03,651
up,
up,

2331
01:36:03,651 --> 01:36:06,620
up and you're looking at your life and 
like a timeline and it will be like,

2332
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:08,520
think about a time when you,
you know,

2333
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:11,570
as far back as you could possibly 
remember and you will tap into some shit

2334
01:36:11,571 --> 01:36:12,404
from like a Jew childhood that you 
didn't even know that you even 

2335
01:36:14,121 --> 01:36:15,140
remembered.
You know what I mean?

2336
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:16,513
And,
uh,

2337
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,210
some really some really far out stuff 
and it will change a lot of things.

2338
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:21,643
If you think about it,
like everything that's ever happened to 

2339
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:26,300
your whole life isn't you've ever seen 
thought,

2340
01:36:26,301 --> 01:36:30,650
heard is where did that information go?
Like it didn't fall out of your head.

2341
01:36:31,060 --> 01:36:31,641
I mean,
it's there,

2342
01:36:31,641 --> 01:36:34,550
you just can't access it anymore and 
you'd have a hard time accessing it.

2343
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:35,863
And with these hypnosis things,
you have opportunity to still tap into 

2344
01:36:40,401 --> 01:36:43,520
that or get better at tapping into them 
accessing that information.

2345
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,800
So what did you get out of it?
Uh,

2346
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:50,690
I remember I said I forgive my dad.
Yeah,

2347
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:51,950
49.
Um,

2348
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:54,110
I hated my dad's guts,
like hated him.

2349
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:57,250
My Dad did some really shitty things to 
me when a,

2350
01:36:57,780 --> 01:36:59,330
and I hated him.
I hated him.

2351
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:00,740
And uh,
vinny,

2352
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,050
um,
one day when he's say,

2353
01:37:03,051 --> 01:37:05,720
I want to try this time on Thailand 
therapy on you if you want to,

2354
01:37:05,730 --> 01:37:06,561
if you're into it.
And I'm like,

2355
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:07,161
yeah.
And be like,

2356
01:37:07,161 --> 01:37:07,881
where's it going to do?
He's like,

2357
01:37:07,881 --> 01:37:08,714
I don't know.
We're just going to see if you'd like 

2358
01:37:09,271 --> 01:37:10,420
this thing.
I had no clue.

2359
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:11,450
It was going to do.
And,

2360
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:12,284
uh,
had me think of all these times of my 

2361
01:37:13,791 --> 01:37:17,480
life and when I felt really proud,
when I felt really afraid,

2362
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:19,580
when I felt really scared,
when I felt really strong,

2363
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:21,380
when I felt really all these emotions.
And,

2364
01:37:21,381 --> 01:37:22,214
uh,
it was probably about 45 minutes and 

2365
01:37:24,650 --> 01:37:27,500
every single one of the emotions was 
some other time with my dad.

2366
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,380
It was weird.
And,

2367
01:37:30,381 --> 01:37:32,030
uh,
when we got done with the session,

2368
01:37:32,031 --> 01:37:32,864
like I couldn't even tap into that 
hatred that I had from my dad anymore 

2369
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:37,670
and I fucking hated him.
When I found out he had cancer,

2370
01:37:37,671 --> 01:37:39,920
I was like,
I don't give a shit and fucking,

2371
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:41,180
you know,
and,

2372
01:37:41,181 --> 01:37:42,170
uh,
after that session,

2373
01:37:42,171 --> 01:37:43,004
like I,
I didn't have that anger anymore and I 

2374
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:46,820
couldn't even find it,
you know.

2375
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:49,250
And I used to be able to like look in 
the mirror and think about my dad and my

2376
01:37:49,251 --> 01:37:50,780
eyes.
We are ready to be so fucking mad.

2377
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,640
You know,
I used to fight when I was,

2378
01:37:52,641 --> 01:37:53,474
uh,
I used to do a lot of things that were 

2379
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,980
based off of

2380
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,270
like shoving up my dad's ass.
Like,

2381
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:59,670
I want to show him not necessarily 
fighting the person,

2382
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:02,300
like not pretending it's my dad,
but it was more like I'm going to,

2383
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,633
you know,
I had a lot of motivation from my dad 

2384
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:05,820
and uh,
yeah.

2385
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:07,380
When,
when the session was over,

2386
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,660
I had,
I couldn't even tap into that.

2387
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:14,720
I was able to go and I decided to go and
start a new relationship with my dad and

2388
01:38:14,881 --> 01:38:17,880
it wasn't like I forgive you but say 
you're sorry.

2389
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:18,601
You know,
I'm still,

2390
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:20,880
it was like I just didn't give a fuck 
anymore that like,

2391
01:38:20,881 --> 01:38:22,110
it wasn't worth it.
And,

2392
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:22,944
um,
people that really knew me really well 

2393
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:26,004
could just see me differently.
Like there was like this chip that I 

2394
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:29,670
carried around on my shoulder that 
wasn't there anymore.

2395
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:31,800
It was nuts.
It was nuts.

2396
01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:33,750
That's,
that's an interesting thing.

2397
01:38:33,780 --> 01:38:35,850
Um,
the idea of timeline therapy,

2398
01:38:35,851 --> 01:38:40,290
the idea of thinking about your life and
being able to separate yourself,

2399
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:41,363
like who you are right now,
and go back and look at all these 

2400
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:44,484
moments in your life and what they meant
to you and how you're carrying that 

2401
01:38:46,411 --> 01:38:50,040
around today.
That'd be very valuable to people.

2402
01:38:50,090 --> 01:38:51,090
Yup.
It's uh,

2403
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:52,213
it's,
uh,

2404
01:38:52,850 --> 01:38:53,940
you know,
he does all kinds of stuff.

2405
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:54,970
You have a phobia,
you know,

2406
01:38:55,080 --> 01:38:57,540
if you're afraid of fucking spiders or 
whatever,

2407
01:38:57,541 --> 01:39:00,990
he can do shit with you and get rid of a
phobia.

2408
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,870
Yup.
Hypnotize you.

2409
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:05,820
I don't know how he doesn't,
if that's him,

2410
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:08,400
but like he can hypnotize you and have 
you get rid of that phobia.

2411
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:11,790
Like where you were not afraid of those 
things anymore.

2412
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,380
Yeah.
I don't,

2413
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:15,960
I wish I had a recording of what he was 
doing,

2414
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:17,393
you know,
like what he said and the way send back 

2415
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:19,950
over and a couple of weeks.

2416
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:20,791
Yeah.
He just sent me an email.

2417
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:21,624
I've got to get back to the,
he's got a podcast he's going to called 

2418
01:39:23,401 --> 01:39:24,750
the mind diet.
Oh really?

2419
01:39:24,780 --> 01:39:25,890
Yeah,
he's great.

2420
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,020
I'm a big fan of Benny's.
I just,

2421
01:39:28,021 --> 01:39:28,854
as a person,
I really enjoy them and he's a very 

2422
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:32,100
good,
uh,

2423
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:35,190
Moitai commentator to,
yeah.

2424
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:36,360
Really knows her shit.
What's he doing?

2425
01:39:36,361 --> 01:39:37,830
He was doing its glory,
right?

2426
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,960
No infusion now.
Okay.

2427
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:42,450
What was he do you do?
It's showtime.

2428
01:39:42,750 --> 01:39:43,081
Yeah,
it was,

2429
01:39:43,081 --> 01:39:44,510
it showtime,
showtime.

2430
01:39:44,511 --> 01:39:45,720
Fusion.
Just k one,

2431
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:47,460
I can a day.
It's glory.

2432
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,050
Glory.
I've met,

2433
01:39:49,051 --> 01:39:51,170
it's showtime.
Showtime.

2434
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:54,120
They ended up being gone.
Yeah.

2435
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,910
Yeah.
Why?

2436
01:39:56,970 --> 01:40:00,240
How the fuck did kickboxing becomes so 
goddamn big in Europe?

2437
01:40:00,770 --> 01:40:01,603
I mean,
it's so huge in other parts of the 

2438
01:40:02,731 --> 01:40:03,564
world.
Yeah.

2439
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:05,700
Especially Holland.
Uh,

2440
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:07,170
they just,
uh,

2441
01:40:07,170 --> 01:40:08,003
they got,
they had the right people promoting it 

2442
01:40:09,301 --> 01:40:14,010
and k one with most of those guys work 
from most of the management guys.

2443
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:17,220
Four k one were Dutch and their fighters
were Dutch.

2444
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:19,470
And then,
I don't know,

2445
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:20,423
I think we're wearing,
when the US was blowing up with him and 

2446
01:40:22,621 --> 01:40:23,454
man,
they were there were still on the 

2447
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:27,810
kickboxing training.
That's why we ain't got held back.

2448
01:40:27,811 --> 01:40:28,980
I think.
Well,

2449
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:31,440
it's amazing when you look at cage 
fighters ruined it for us.

2450
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:33,390
God dammit.
What's in the back though?

2451
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:34,373
If you look at all the different people 
that are super high level kickboxers it 

2452
01:40:39,321 --> 01:40:44,100
came from this one really small country 
in Holland is not very big at all.

2453
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:48,450
But you've got rob came in,
you've got Ernesto hoost.

2454
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:49,613
I mean,
it is just like this incredible hot bed 

2455
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:55,270
of super high level kickboxing talent.
I mean,

2456
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:56,223
uh,
Ramon,

2457
01:40:56,290 --> 01:40:57,620
Ramon dekkers.
I mean,

2458
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:59,260
Geez,
you can go on and on and on and can keep

2459
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:00,094
going about all the high level talent 
that came out of Holland and to this 

2460
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:06,310
day,
you know Badr Hari five gyms.

2461
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,830
Yeah,
maybe not even five.

2462
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:08,673
It was like three or four,
like major gyms and they just haul it 

2463
01:41:10,281 --> 01:41:13,420
competed all the time.
And it was the blue up.

2464
01:41:13,421 --> 01:41:14,790
Yeah.
What's going on with that butter?

2465
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:15,624
How are you,
dude?

2466
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:20,590
That guy's always breaking people's legs
and nightclubs and knocking people out.

2467
01:41:20,591 --> 01:41:22,120
He's fucking crazy motherfucker.
Right?

2468
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:24,070
He's angry as fuck.
Why is he so angry?

2469
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:25,660
I Dunno.
I never met the guy.

2470
01:41:25,661 --> 01:41:27,290
I was over to meet him some day,
you know,

2471
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:28,124
that's a,
it's one of the few people left on my 

2472
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:31,000
bucket list of people that haven't met 
his butter.

2473
01:41:31,001 --> 01:41:31,810
Hurry.
Oh,

2474
01:41:31,810 --> 01:41:33,640
I would be a super fan boy if I met 
butter.

2475
01:41:33,641 --> 01:41:34,474
And then you took a photo with somebody 
and you were saying it was on your 

2476
01:41:36,761 --> 01:41:37,594
instagram.
You're saying there's only one more 

2477
01:41:38,261 --> 01:41:39,094
left?
Yeah.

2478
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:40,023
Who was that was chuckling.
I saw him at a club here and all they 

2479
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:42,970
wouldn't not long ago.

2480
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:44,980
And I was like one minute left and that 
Mike Tyson,

2481
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:47,020
I've met a chocolate though.
You know,

2482
01:41:47,021 --> 01:41:51,370
there's been a lot of people that uh,
I've had the honor of meeting and yeah,

2483
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,080
that was a big one.
And I was like,

2484
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:54,110
oh,
I don't want to be a fanboy of,

2485
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:55,930
I like this.
Yeah.

2486
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:58,970
Yeah.
It's hard not to be a fan boy.

2487
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:03,580
That was like my hero when I was a kid 
is Badr Hari and jail.

2488
01:42:03,581 --> 01:42:06,650
What does he doing now?
Z?

2489
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,380
There's talking about getting them in 
Gloria.

2490
01:42:08,381 --> 01:42:10,570
I think they were trying to,
but uh,

2491
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:12,820
I don't know.
He's so God damn crazy.

2492
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:14,493
Like there's a video of him.
Some guy was working in at the front 

2493
01:42:16,571 --> 01:42:18,790
desk of a hotel and I don't know what 
the fuck he said,

2494
01:42:18,791 --> 01:42:19,624
but bothered it and like it,
so we went behind the counter and 

2495
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:24,920
smacked him in his head it was security 
camera footage.

2496
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:28,000
I hope the guy said something and,
and it's not the butter hard,

2497
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:30,040
he's just a bully because let these guys
are fucking bullies,

2498
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:30,821
you know?
Yeah,

2499
01:42:30,821 --> 01:42:33,330
I hope so too.
I mean it's laughable.

2500
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:37,570
Luxembourg verhoeven on or higher 
superfight rumors are true.

2501
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:38,980
Oh Shit.
Yeah,

2502
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:42,160
that's,
that's a bad mother fucker.

2503
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,930
Rico Verhoeven is a bad motherfucker.
I'm very impressed with that guy.

2504
01:42:46,931 --> 01:42:51,760
You want to talk about that big athletic
heavyweight with sick endurance and just

2505
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:55,360
worldclass kickboxing skill and fucking 
big.

2506
01:42:55,361 --> 01:42:58,240
That dude is enormous.
Not a small guy.

2507
01:42:58,300 --> 01:42:59,800
That guy is fucking huge.
Yeah,

2508
01:42:59,801 --> 01:43:02,470
he's huge.
He's just a giant giant man.

2509
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:06,880
He's a giant man,
giant and like really good endurance for

2510
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:08,840
a big guy.
He pushes a great paint.

2511
01:43:08,910 --> 01:43:09,743
Really good boxing.
He was like part of a Tyson fury is a 

2512
01:43:12,280 --> 01:43:16,650
camp for Klitschko was he really?
Isn't that interesting?

2513
01:43:16,651 --> 01:43:18,520
There's a gypsy world heavyweight 
champion.

2514
01:43:19,140 --> 01:43:19,973
A lot of this guy's a gypsy gypsy.
Is that a bad word or traveler I guess 

2515
01:43:22,691 --> 01:43:24,700
is the better one traveler.
That's what I like to call it.

2516
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:28,720
Pikey hiking the same.
The pikeys bad.

2517
01:43:28,721 --> 01:43:30,990
I think pikey is like not that's a 
derogatory term.

2518
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:32,770
Sorry folks.
Sorry.

2519
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:36,260
It's fucking language.
Play travelers like travelers.

2520
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:40,240
There is a tricky one because in some 
places the Eskimo is a,

2521
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:42,430
is an insult.
But in like Alaska,

2522
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:43,713
they don't have a problem with Eskimo.
Like the people that live in certain 

2523
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:48,430
parts of Alaska,
apparently they,

2524
01:43:48,460 --> 01:43:50,020
that's what they call them.
So they like it.

2525
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:53,570
It's Omni issue.
Depends is totally geographical.

2526
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:54,680
Who else would be,
uh,

2527
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:58,360
an Eskimo outside of Alaska in you?
It's in you.

2528
01:43:58,370 --> 01:43:59,203
It's a,
they live a different parts of the 

2529
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:01,420
world.
Uh,

2530
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:03,290
Canada,
I think in Canada,

2531
01:44:03,291 --> 01:44:04,124
Eskimo may be a,
an insult because they're not from 

2532
01:44:07,521 --> 01:44:08,330
Alaska.

2533
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:09,163
I just think they're the same people,
but they just prefer a different name 

2534
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:14,410
maybe.
Well,

2535
01:44:14,411 --> 01:44:17,600
I like the people in Canada.
They call themselves a,

2536
01:44:17,610 --> 01:44:19,640
the natives call them cells.
First nations.

2537
01:44:20,210 --> 01:44:20,841
Hmm.
Yeah.

2538
01:44:20,841 --> 01:44:21,320
The,
you can't,

2539
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,210
you can't call them.
Indians are not Indians.

2540
01:44:23,270 --> 01:44:24,103
So it's like,
it's essentially the same kind of 

2541
01:44:25,251 --> 01:44:27,350
people.
They're just in a different spot.

2542
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:29,090
It's all fucking weird,
man.

2543
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:32,150
It's all weird.
But yeah,

2544
01:44:32,151 --> 01:44:34,030
you gotta be careful.
Travelers calm.

2545
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:35,590
A traveler traveler,
I think is there.

2546
01:44:36,350 --> 01:44:39,320
He's a funny guy though.
He fucked with Vladimir Klitschkos head.

2547
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,080
He really fucked with his head.
He's a funny motherfucker.

2548
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,130
He's funny.
Very funny.

2549
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:44,990
Hilarious.
It's terrible sanger though.

2550
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:48,020
Tell him to stop singing.
Go.

2551
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:52,290
But they're having this a heavyweight 
title and getting to go to the family is

2552
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:53,900
a trailer.
Are they really?

2553
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:55,700
That makes sense.
And uh,

2554
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,790
who else?
Uh,

2555
01:44:57,840 --> 01:44:58,673
over cross?

2556
01:44:58,910 --> 01:45:00,350
He's another one.
Really.

2557
01:45:01,610 --> 01:45:03,020
Wow.
Tough fuckers,

2558
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,003
but makes sense.
Theory does like interviews from inside 

2559
01:45:06,711 --> 01:45:07,544
his trailer.
He's like,

2560
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:09,590
does he really?
I just saw one the other day.

2561
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,190
He still has a trailer still as a world 
champion.

2562
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:14,210
Yup.
He's living in a trailer.

2563
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,073
Yep.
Whoa.

2564
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:16,780
The traveler.
Hmm.

2565
01:45:16,830 --> 01:45:19,430
It's proud of is,
do you think he keeps the house too?

2566
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:21,350
I don't know.
I have no idea.

2567
01:45:22,570 --> 01:45:23,450
Yeah.
I don't think,

2568
01:45:23,451 --> 01:45:27,250
I don't think being a traveler from what
might know about,

2569
01:45:27,260 --> 01:45:29,330
well I don't really fuck do I know,
but I don't think that there,

2570
01:45:29,331 --> 01:45:31,430
it's about the money thing because I 
think a lot of those people have,

2571
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:32,443
have,
uh,

2572
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:37,010
have money in flashy stuff and whatever.
It's just like their way of life.

2573
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,190
Oh,
really?

2574
01:45:38,190 --> 01:45:40,220
You had to be able to pick up and go 
everyone.

2575
01:45:40,730 --> 01:45:43,400
So they just don't want to have roots.

2576
01:45:43,490 --> 01:45:46,280
They liked to be able to just have the,
what they call him caravans.

2577
01:45:46,281 --> 01:45:48,670
I saw them and he snatch.
That's my favorite movie of all time.

2578
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:49,903
Favorite movie of all time.
I could fucking recite that entire 

2579
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:54,380
movie.
There he is.

2580
01:45:54,381 --> 01:45:57,680
Yeah.
Tyson fury is fucking enormous.

2581
01:45:57,890 --> 01:46:00,320
Heavyweight boxer can't even stand up in
his trailer.

2582
01:46:01,190 --> 01:46:04,880
He's too tall for his own trailer.
And that's where you actually get of in.

2583
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:06,610
Hey,
if I can get out of it.

2584
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:11,420
Yeah.
That be like tags that Brad Pitt movie.

2585
01:46:11,570 --> 01:46:14,110
That was a good fucking moving.
Such a good movie.

2586
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:15,283
I had no idea those people talk.
This is just train Jackson before that 

2587
01:46:17,271 --> 01:46:18,104
movie.
And then I got stuck watching these 

2588
01:46:21,111 --> 01:46:23,510
movies are these uh,
videos on youtube.

2589
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:24,513
What?
These travelers are challenging each 

2590
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:27,870
other.
He ever watched those I fucking love has

2591
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:28,780
the best.
Oh,

2592
01:46:28,781 --> 01:46:30,850
you're a fucking piece of Shite,
Jackie.

2593
01:46:33,380 --> 01:46:34,340
What?
The kids,

2594
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:36,680
the kids.
All the kids are still good.

2595
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:40,550
Yeah.
Fucking hang me.

2596
01:46:40,570 --> 01:46:41,130
The flood.
Yeah,

2597
01:46:41,130 --> 01:46:42,530
I'm going to plug you good.
Yeah.

2598
01:46:42,531 --> 01:46:44,630
But they had these fucking bare knuckle 
fights,

2599
01:46:44,631 --> 01:46:46,580
man.
And they have no rounds.

2600
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:50,250
They have some weird rules and they're 
all fight with their fucking jeans on.

2601
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:51,113
Yeah.
They have like their own court system 

2602
01:46:52,050 --> 01:46:52,883
and like that's if you have a dispute,
that's why it's somewhat like food 

2603
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:59,340
dispute and then the fight over it and 
like when you know it's settled,

2604
01:46:59,341 --> 01:47:00,470
when it's settled,
it's settled.

2605
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:03,510
We'll have like a fucking,
like a file full on fucking fight.

2606
01:47:03,511 --> 01:47:05,280
And that's like,
that's the law.

2607
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:06,660
Like okay,
he won.

2608
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:08,190
He wins.
Like keep that.

2609
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:09,570
He's,
you know what I mean?

2610
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:10,650
Yeah.
It's crazy.

2611
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:11,993
But it's just interesting to watch it 
all play out on youtube because you 

2612
01:47:14,341 --> 01:47:15,174
might have heard about all this stuff 
before or you hear about in stories and 

2613
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:18,744
legends,
but I think our age is the first age 

2614
01:47:20,731 --> 01:47:22,410
that's ever had a chance to wash these 
guys.

2615
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:23,470
Challenge each other.
Huh?

2616
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:28,730
I'm calling you out your fucking bag of 
shade and there's a ton of them online.

2617
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:31,720
They're really interesting to watch 
because you,

2618
01:47:31,721 --> 01:47:34,920
you're getting a peek into like a very,
um,

2619
01:47:35,310 --> 01:47:37,470
uh,
very sensitive culture sensitive in that

2620
01:47:37,471 --> 01:47:39,720
like there's not,
they don't have,

2621
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:44,880
there's not like a lot of history behind
it in terms of uh,

2622
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:49,710
you know,
like a documented culture and they could

2623
01:47:49,711 --> 01:47:50,544
go away like that.
That's something that might not be here 

2624
01:47:52,861 --> 01:47:53,694
a hundred years from now.
Like we might be watching a type of 

2625
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,560
people or a group of people that are 
living a certain way that,

2626
01:47:59,190 --> 01:48:01,710
you know,
things might change and the next hundred

2627
01:48:01,710 --> 01:48:04,440
years and they might integrate back into
society like these fucking people,

2628
01:48:05,360 --> 01:48:06,193
the halls one already knows about and 
you're going round the first round is 

2629
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:09,630
telling people you're the case.
What?

2630
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:12,120
I'm going to Burger King.
How are you the Kenyan fuck off second.

2631
01:48:12,121 --> 01:48:13,200
I'm going to fight in your whole life.

2632
01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:16,100
Oh,
neat

2633
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:27,010
challenge there.
There's one like little bit to Jerry,

2634
01:48:27,011 --> 01:48:27,844
which I left

2635
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:32,390
this fucking guy

2636
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:37,220
two young kids in is so fucking funny.
Oh my God.

2637
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:38,933
Red Wine.
You're yet the hallmark knows who's 

2638
01:48:39,781 --> 01:48:40,614
talking to me out.
I just think it's so interesting to see 

2639
01:48:42,301 --> 01:48:43,134
all this stuff on youtube because like 
we have like a view into this culture 

2640
01:48:48,001 --> 01:48:50,850
that we just never,
you never would have gotten this before.

2641
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,080
You would have heard,
you know,

2642
01:48:52,081 --> 01:48:52,914
Patio Brian called out mickey fuck face 
and they met in the swamps and duked it 

2643
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:57,780
out.
But,

2644
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:59,880
but see in this,
and again,

2645
01:48:59,881 --> 01:49:00,930
I mean,
you know,

2646
01:49:00,931 --> 01:49:02,880
I would like them to be able to keep 
their way of life and all that.

2647
01:49:02,881 --> 01:49:04,530
I'm not saying that they shouldn't be 
able to do this,

2648
01:49:04,531 --> 01:49:08,610
but I'm saying that it's possible that 
that might not be there in 50 years.

2649
01:49:08,910 --> 01:49:10,650
I these people,
they don't really have us,

2650
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:13,200
they don't have a country,
they don't have a city.

2651
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,940
So it's,
it's kind of delicate.

2652
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:15,803
Their existence is fairly delicate.
It's not like you're talking about 

2653
01:49:18,301 --> 01:49:19,134
people like,
oh these are guys that live in Detroit 

2654
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:23,490
and Detroit always had this sort of like
a gypsy community.

2655
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:24,363
No,
no,

2656
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:25,283
they,
they fucking travel around and a lot of 

2657
01:49:27,151 --> 01:49:28,950
places we travel,
people don't want them there.

2658
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:34,620
I have friends who are from London and 
they had a house that is in some suburb,

2659
01:49:34,621 --> 01:49:35,820
I don't know what they call it in 
England,

2660
01:49:35,821 --> 01:49:37,530
I don't think they call it a suburb in 
the country.

2661
01:49:37,710 --> 01:49:41,340
They had this house and these travelers 
moved next to their house.

2662
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:42,630
There was like a lot next to their 
house.

2663
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:43,464
They just set up shop party till fucking
four o'clock in the morning through 

2664
01:49:46,321 --> 01:49:48,670
garbage in the street and nobody could 
do shit.

2665
01:49:48,671 --> 01:49:49,504
They're all scared to say anything.
Everyone's scared to say anything and 

2666
01:49:52,180 --> 01:49:54,820
you can't like he,
there's no laws.

2667
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:57,040
Like there's no law against what they're
doing.

2668
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:59,350
Cause there's like,
you can't discriminate against these,

2669
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:00,273
these travelers.
So it's this weird situation where 

2670
01:50:02,411 --> 01:50:04,870
people are trying to sell their houses.
Nobody wants to buy it.

2671
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:09,130
Property values crashed and these proper
English people that I'm friends with,

2672
01:50:09,131 --> 01:50:09,964
we're trying to explain the terrors of 
these people move in next door and I'm 

2673
01:50:12,140 --> 01:50:15,460
chuckling,
oh your second house on a,

2674
01:50:15,461 --> 01:50:16,294
what are you going to do?
These people just move next door and 

2675
01:50:18,011 --> 01:50:20,860
they're fucking party.
And what can you do though?

2676
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:24,820
Good challenge him if I fucking win.
You've got to move.

2677
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:27,400
Exactly.
How do you listen?

2678
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:29,860
You hear me?
Y'All fucking Babish Scheid I'm going to

2679
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:33,440
kick you out of my neck and my God,
my snooty neighborhood.

2680
01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:34,511
Yeah.
The uh,

2681
01:50:34,511 --> 01:50:35,344
they just set up shop and started 
partying and people like what in the 

2682
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:38,944
fuck q magine if you like one of those 
pinkies out teetotaller type English 

2683
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:43,624
people who are super proper and these 
motherfuckers moved next door started 

2684
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:51,740
bloodying each other up having bonfires.
It's,

2685
01:50:51,790 --> 01:50:52,623
I don't know,
there's something about the way they 

2686
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:53,854
live is fun.

2687
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:58,720
I like something about it.
I'm glad they were around.

2688
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,330
Yeah.
That's exciting.

2689
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:01,180
Yeah,
I think so too.

2690
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,190
Yeah.
Let them be them with them.

2691
01:51:03,191 --> 01:51:04,610
Live their lives.
I mean,

2692
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,570
sorry,
sorry if you're there in your house.

2693
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:08,650
I'm sorry.
Two Yard.

2694
01:51:08,651 --> 01:51:11,560
But yeah,
I'm sorry if they fucked up your house.

2695
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,453
Yeah.
But,

2696
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:15,040
but it's kind of fun there around.
Awesome.

2697
01:51:15,850 --> 01:51:18,580
I hope they win in the greater picture 
of civilization.

2698
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:21,100
It's an interesting,
it's an interesting element.

2699
01:51:23,380 --> 01:51:25,630
And on that note,
I want to wrap this up.

2700
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:26,860
Sure.
Anything else?

2701
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:28,890
Um,
no,

2702
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:32,020
not the haters,
but no tall and nice people out there.

2703
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:33,790
Shout outs to all the fans.
Oh,

2704
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:34,810
shout outs,
all the fans,

2705
01:51:34,811 --> 01:51:35,644
you know,
uh,

2706
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:38,540
never a boring fight and I'll be back 
and uh,

2707
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:40,770
I will come back from this like I always
have.

2708
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:42,910
I'm never going to turn off tuition only
fine.

2709
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:44,920
You got a great fucking attitude,
dude.

2710
01:51:44,950 --> 01:51:46,990
You had a great attitude,
even through losses.

2711
01:51:46,991 --> 01:51:47,824
And I think people do appreciate that 
and I definitely appreciate the fact 

2712
01:51:50,111 --> 01:51:51,460
that you,
you fight the way you do.

2713
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:53,140
I got to tell you about this from 
machine though.

2714
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:54,133
Um,
it's called a frog or have you heard of 

2715
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:55,990
this?
A frogger.

2716
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:57,130
It's called a frog.
Frogger.

2717
01:51:57,131 --> 01:51:58,410
Frogger.
It's a,

2718
01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:01,570
this a machine they sent him.
He just sent it to my gym.

2719
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,450
It's a,
uh,

2720
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:04,930
it's on wheels.
It's like a full body movement.

2721
01:52:04,931 --> 01:52:06,310
It's designed for,
um,

2722
01:52:07,240 --> 01:52:08,920
like other marketing and stuff.
Football players.

2723
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:11,800
And it's like a fuck can you,
can you look it up?

2724
01:52:11,890 --> 01:52:15,540
I don't even know how to explain the 
Shin and what are you doing?

2725
01:52:15,541 --> 01:52:18,940
It's like you're on wheels and you can 
only do it in place or you can do it.

2726
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:20,590
Uh,
you could actually raise people in it.

2727
01:52:20,650 --> 01:52:22,300
And it's a,
I'm telling you,

2728
01:52:22,301 --> 01:52:23,134
it's like a good to find it.
You raise people that you can race in 

2729
01:52:26,861 --> 01:52:28,230
it.
If I can show you this,

2730
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:30,850
can you find you find it Jamie?
Nope.

2731
01:52:32,860 --> 01:52:35,460
Do you know the company that makes it?
I had to.

2732
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:37,143
We're going to get this information.
We're really done well in this whole 

2733
01:52:38,591 --> 01:52:42,430
flux on wheels.
Like I'm playing charades.

2734
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,410
It's a,
it's a frog,

2735
01:52:44,411 --> 01:52:46,490
but it's not.
It's a frogger.

2736
01:52:46,670 --> 01:52:48,310
A football players use it.

2737
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:50,440
MMM.
MMM.

2738
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:53,870
Okay.
I'm looking at this thing.

2739
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,950
Oh,
this is crazy.

2740
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:58,930
It's like Nielsen Spans here.
Feet is like,

2741
01:52:59,530 --> 01:53:01,580
oh my God.
It's like doing a burpee.

2742
01:53:01,610 --> 01:53:05,250
Is Jamie sign this thing ever working?
Jamie,

2743
01:53:05,270 --> 01:53:06,103
find this.

2744
01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:13,280
What is the name of the link or what is 
the name of that thing?

2745
01:53:13,290 --> 01:53:14,123
It's what I'm looking at folks.
It's like sort of like a super advanced 

2746
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:17,924
version of an AB wheel,
but you have one on your feet and 

2747
01:53:20,181 --> 01:53:23,720
washing your hands and you're pushing 
forward with the one on your hands where

2748
01:53:23,721 --> 01:53:24,554
it's like a almost like a cart and then 
you're pulling the AB wheel that's 

2749
01:53:28,881 --> 01:53:32,930
connected to your feet forward and 
pushing frog fitness.

2750
01:53:33,570 --> 01:53:34,403
I just pulled it up cause you kind of 
looked like a frog while you're doing 

2751
01:53:36,381 --> 01:53:38,540
it.
Here it is frog fitness,

2752
01:53:38,750 --> 01:53:43,750
fill out one of our forms or click here 
to head to our new website.

2753
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:47,130
So they sent me two of these to the gym 
for me to try out and I was like Oh that

2754
01:53:47,131 --> 01:53:48,470
looks like fun.
This is like,

2755
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:49,333
you know,
you'd be like a burpee and you like 

2756
01:53:50,570 --> 01:53:52,220
almost immediate exhaustion like that.

2757
01:53:52,270 --> 01:53:53,103
Yeah that thing is one of the hardest 
workouts I've ever had and they're 

2758
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:58,190
marketing it for like a lot of the NFL 
training camps are getting it cause it's

2759
01:53:58,191 --> 01:54:01,130
like the same position for right for 
football,

2760
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:03,320
but it's a,
it's a beast of a thing.

2761
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:05,990
So that would make sense that it would 
be really good for wrestling too.

2762
01:54:05,991 --> 01:54:06,824
Then,
yeah,

2763
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,530
the new evolution in fitness.
Okay.

2764
01:54:09,531 --> 01:54:10,364
So it's got resistance bands.
So you push the forward cart and the 

2765
01:54:14,031 --> 01:54:16,180
resistance bands,
uh,

2766
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:20,000
are resisting you as you push forward 
and then you pull your legs forward.

2767
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:22,530
Wow.
This looks fucking bad ass.

2768
01:54:22,730 --> 01:54:26,570
It works every part of your body.
And it was like immediate exhaustion.

2769
01:54:26,630 --> 01:54:27,463
Like wow.
It's like nothing else I've ever used 

2770
01:54:28,371 --> 01:54:29,360
before.
It's fucking awesome.

2771
01:54:29,370 --> 01:54:30,260
But no,
Kenny man.

2772
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:31,123
And do you feel any benefit of this when
you're a sparring or when you're 

2773
01:54:33,471 --> 01:54:35,180
training or,
I used it for like cardio,

2774
01:54:35,181 --> 01:54:35,930
I even used it.

2775
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:37,300
Um,
and you can read,

2776
01:54:37,320 --> 01:54:39,470
you can set it so that you can,
you'd be in one place,

2777
01:54:39,471 --> 01:54:41,360
you know,
so that you're not going anywhere.

2778
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:42,223
You know,
it seems like you would get up really 

2779
01:54:44,601 --> 01:54:45,434
hard workouts to it.
But I'll do that with my altitude 

2780
01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:52,370
machine cause it just zaps you get so 
fucking tired so fast.

2781
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:54,200
So I try to do that even at high 
altitude.

2782
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,513
Okay.
So this girl was using it to do like 

2783
01:54:57,441 --> 01:55:00,170
cleans and presses and she's doing like 
rose with it.

2784
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:03,980
So the wheel also acts as resistance 
with the bands.

2785
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:04,814
Yeah.
You can put like a 160 pounds in the 

2786
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:07,880
thing or something.
It's something else.

2787
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:08,990
It's nuts.
Wow.

2788
01:55:08,991 --> 01:55:09,824
Okay.
So you use fat or bands and then it 

2789
01:55:11,751 --> 01:55:15,050
makes more resistance as you push 
forward is just the guy who invented it.

2790
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:17,720
He looks like a frog.
Sorry Buddy.

2791
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:20,240
Not in a bad way.
Frogs are awesome.

2792
01:55:21,130 --> 01:55:22,570
Frogs get your high if you're like,
um,

2793
01:55:22,910 --> 01:55:23,720
um,
so this,

2794
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:26,660
this one right here.
Like that guy's got it fully loaded up.

2795
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:28,970
Oh Wow.
Look at that.

2796
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:30,470
That is interesting.
Map.

2797
01:55:31,010 --> 01:55:32,570
Okay.
So you could put a bunch.

2798
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,670
There's a bunch of different ways to use
that thing.

2799
01:55:34,820 --> 01:55:37,010
Hmm.
Wow.

2800
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,640
I like it must give you a fucking hell 
of a core workout.

2801
01:55:40,641 --> 01:55:41,474
How it's,
it's,

2802
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,800
it's,
it's hard to,

2803
01:55:42,801 --> 01:55:44,130
it's fucking terrible.

2804
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:45,540
It's fun,
but I fucking hate it and like,

2805
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:47,010
I hate it.
It's exhausting.

2806
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:47,873
Exhausting.
What is your strength and conditioning 

2807
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:51,510
when you're not working with curse on 
like what do you do?

2808
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:53,820
Do you just mostly concentrate on fight 
preparation,

2809
01:55:53,821 --> 01:55:55,710
like pad work,
sparring,

2810
01:55:55,711 --> 01:55:57,060
bag work,
things along those lines?

2811
01:55:57,510 --> 01:56:00,510
I'm not working with Kirsten and I run,
I'll do a lot of sprints,

2812
01:56:00,511 --> 01:56:01,890
would be allowed to bought us.
And then,

2813
01:56:01,891 --> 01:56:02,724
um,
mostly explained to bottle that people 

2814
01:56:04,861 --> 01:56:07,230
don't want to bother 50th,
the interval thing.

2815
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:08,064
It's eight rounds of 15 seconds of work 
or 20 seconds of work and 10 seconds of 

2816
01:56:12,181 --> 01:56:13,680
rest.
And when you're doing is you're going as

2817
01:56:13,681 --> 01:56:16,170
fast and as hard as you can for 20 
seconds,

2818
01:56:16,171 --> 01:56:19,140
getting your heart rate as high as 
possible and then immediately went,

2819
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:21,060
20 seconds is up,
you have 10 seconds of rest.

2820
01:56:21,070 --> 01:56:21,903
So you're training your,
your heart rate to get used to spiking 

2821
01:56:25,861 --> 01:56:28,050
and they come back down in your,
you're training your,

2822
01:56:28,051 --> 01:56:29,300
it can increase your,
uh,

2823
01:56:29,490 --> 01:56:31,080
your vo two Max,
like incredibly.

2824
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:33,850
And to bought us is like really a big 
part of my,

2825
01:56:33,890 --> 01:56:35,460
my cardio sessions.
Yeah.

2826
01:56:35,461 --> 01:56:36,294
It's an amazing protocol that was 
invented that I don't know who invented 

2827
01:56:39,871 --> 01:56:41,280
it.
So it'd be a four minute round total,

2828
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:43,610
eight times of eight of 20 seconds.
Right.

2829
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:44,633
But it sort of goes along the same lines
of what we're talking about with nick 

2830
01:56:47,641 --> 01:56:50,340
curse on is doing or what a pebble Tatsu
lead is doing.

2831
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:51,413
It's not about massive amounts of work.
It's amount doing it smart and doing it 

2832
01:56:54,301 --> 01:56:57,210
the right way.
So these 22nd sprint and he's ten second

2833
01:56:57,211 --> 01:56:58,440
brakes,
man,

2834
01:56:58,441 --> 01:57:00,510
what a massive impact it has on your 
cardio.

2835
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,340
And he can do that with anything.
You'd be on a,

2836
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:04,410
you could be running,
you could be happy,

2837
01:57:04,470 --> 01:57:06,550
even hit pads with it,
you know,

2838
01:57:06,570 --> 01:57:08,280
do a bag work,
you know,

2839
01:57:08,281 --> 01:57:10,530
hard as you can for 20 seconds.
And then 10 seconds off.

2840
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,190
You think about that sort of hellified 
is anyway,

2841
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:13,043
have a 22nd bursts and you're like 10 
seconds and getting your shit together 

2842
01:57:15,001 --> 01:57:18,210
and the 22nd bursts.
I do that a lot.

2843
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:19,103
And then,
uh,

2844
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:20,123
lately I've been doing a lot more just 
pad work and speed work and I'm using a 

2845
01:57:23,550 --> 01:57:24,960
double end bag a lot,
you know,

2846
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:26,980
I'm trying to get,
um,

2847
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:29,700
for a long time I was trying to be,
um,

2848
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:35,000
very physical and very,
my outworking the other person and being

2849
01:57:35,491 --> 01:57:39,570
like more aggressive and I'm trying to 
get more to,

2850
01:57:39,710 --> 01:57:41,460
to uh,
speed and technique,

2851
01:57:41,530 --> 01:57:44,250
you know,
then they tried to outwork people.

2852
01:57:44,820 --> 01:57:46,890
There's definitely,
there's definitely a smart move.

2853
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:48,660
Yeah,
definitely a smart way to go.

2854
01:57:48,990 --> 01:57:50,700
And it was exactly what I did last 
Friday night,

2855
01:57:50,701 --> 01:57:51,534
but then,
uh,

2856
01:57:52,170 --> 01:57:54,090
Jason Wellness Wellness Day at the time 
of four,

2857
01:57:54,091 --> 01:57:55,440
it was like a really good example of 
that.

2858
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:56,910
And that was a very good example of 
that.

2859
01:57:56,970 --> 01:57:57,803
Yeah.
And wellness is a dangerous 

2860
01:57:58,300 --> 01:58:00,180
motherfucker.
That guy's very dangerous.

2861
01:58:00,181 --> 01:58:02,370
He hits hard.
He's a,

2862
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:04,260
he's a real threat.
That was a real good fight.

2863
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:05,393
Nope.
Yeah.

2864
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:06,521
So,
uh,

2865
01:58:06,521 --> 01:58:07,620
all right brother.
Well,

2866
01:58:07,621 --> 01:58:08,730
um,
oh,

2867
01:58:08,731 --> 01:58:10,470
let me shut up one more.
Kinetic.

2868
01:58:10,530 --> 01:58:11,390
Sorry Buddy.
Uh,

2869
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,440
clean addict motor sports and Long 
Beach.

2870
01:58:13,470 --> 01:58:14,000
They,
uh,

2871
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:14,833
you see my instagram,
they gave me a Ferrari and a feeling of 

2872
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,040
is that real?
Yeah.

2873
01:58:17,041 --> 01:58:19,580
They gave me a fry for like a week until
the fight and then,

2874
01:58:19,581 --> 01:58:20,910
uh,
give it back,

2875
01:58:20,911 --> 01:58:23,520
went to the,
went to the fight and then I got a brand

2876
01:58:23,521 --> 01:58:25,320
new zero six outside right now.
Really?

2877
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:27,660
They're just letting you borrow cars,
you know,

2878
01:58:27,661 --> 01:58:30,730
they gave me cars to a drive so I don't 
have to buy whatever.

2879
01:58:30,731 --> 01:58:32,940
And you know their favor.
The high end car lot.

2880
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,210
They have a fucking super nice cars.
You can rent them.

2881
01:58:36,211 --> 01:58:37,044
You can buy on me.
Can we?

2882
01:58:37,060 --> 01:58:38,730
Or Yeah.
Kinetic motorsports.

2883
01:58:38,860 --> 01:58:40,830
All right.
Powerful motor sports.

2884
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,400
Anybody gives you a Ferrari

2885
01:58:42,850 --> 01:58:44,980
there on my good side.
Get that fucking thing.

2886
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:46,840
Oh Shit.
What was,

2887
01:58:46,841 --> 01:58:48,580
which one was that?
It's a four or five.

2888
01:58:48,581 --> 01:58:51,340
Eight Italia.
What a beautiful car.

2889
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:54,640
Looks so good.
Look at the design of that thing.

2890
01:58:54,641 --> 01:58:57,040
So good Joe.
It's just so spectacular.

2891
01:58:57,041 --> 01:58:59,650
It's like a car from the future.
Like when you were a kid,

2892
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:01,900
you thought about a car in the future.
That's what you like.

2893
01:59:01,990 --> 01:59:06,990
And then I had a fucking Ferrari 
Testarossa poster on my wall is child's,

2894
01:59:07,511 --> 01:59:08,344
you know what I mean?
Like this is a talk about bucket list 

2895
01:59:10,741 --> 01:59:11,574
shit.
Yeah,

2896
01:59:11,630 --> 01:59:12,463
right there when that,
when that infocus piece came out and 

2897
01:59:14,171 --> 01:59:15,510
they texted it to me,
um,

2898
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:17,860
I was driving in the Ferrari just 
fucking when I,

2899
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:20,680
when they gave me that,
it was like a good two hours where I was

2900
01:59:20,681 --> 01:59:21,940
just like,
ah,

2901
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:23,380
I'm losing my shit.
Right.

2902
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,750
But I'm driving in the Ferrari and I get
a text and uh,

2903
01:59:25,780 --> 01:59:26,410
it was,
uh,

2904
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:27,243
the boats were social media team sends 
me in that video and I'm watching this 

2905
01:59:29,201 --> 01:59:30,034
video of how far I've come and what I've
done for the sport and that can't stop 

2906
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:35,440
crazy and focus piece in the driver's 
seat of Ferrari.

2907
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:37,090
It was a good feeling.
That's ridiculous.

2908
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:41,200
Dana White's the same way when he was a 
kid and he was in love with Testa.

2909
01:59:41,201 --> 01:59:43,030
Rossa like everybody was at watched 
Miami Vice.

2910
01:59:43,330 --> 01:59:44,163
So he had one made,
he had one done up with a custom 

2911
01:59:46,481 --> 01:59:49,300
interior to real stereo.
Apparently that's like a big no,

2912
01:59:49,301 --> 01:59:50,134
no.
Like people don't want to fuck with the 

2913
01:59:50,981 --> 01:59:53,710
original insides of the Ferrari.
He's like,

2914
01:59:53,711 --> 01:59:56,020
fuck you.
He had done up,

2915
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:57,730
but he was like,
I finally got a test.

2916
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:02,340
Terosa those big lines on the side,
you know.

2917
02:00:02,341 --> 02:00:04,300
And that was the car where kids,
fuck.

2918
02:00:04,301 --> 02:00:05,200
Yeah.
All right.

2919
02:00:05,201 --> 02:00:06,430
Joe Schilling,
