1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:05,820
Try to keep this a about a fist away
from your face.

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,850
The best length.
This a little closer.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,180
If you can have a good,
we're live.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,830
Oh,
that was quick.

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,941
Oh,
you're,

6
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:16,740
you're a wizard over there,
Mr Blum.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,480
Yes.
Chow man.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,633
I appreciate it.
Well,

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,460
we were in a film together so we've been
like right next to each other on

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,240
cellulite.
Let someone we in that was the culture.

11
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,560
Hi Brett Harvey.
And it's a you,

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,520
me,
Richard Branson and snoop Dogg.

13
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,960
Oh,
good company.

14
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,823
Yes.
Right.

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:37,171
Yeah.
So,

16
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,790
um,
well you were just saying right before

17
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,740
we did the podcast,
you were in bed for 15 years.

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,010
I was,
I got sick in 1988.

19
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,830
I wasn't able to make it out of that bed
until 2003.

20
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,680
But Joe,
I was absolutely certain I would never

21
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,350
make it out of that bed.
What did you have?

22
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,880
It's called these days.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,110
This month it's called a m e cfs.
Uh,

24
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:01,770
up until now it was just known as
chronic fatigue syndrome cfs.

25
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,700
But it's real serious if you get a bad
case of it.

26
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:09,600
So I was too weak to talk for five years
too weak to talk.

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,880
You didn't talk at all?
Not a bit.

28
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,940
I didn't have the strength to puff out
even a syllable.

29
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,580
Um,
and um,

30
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,670
I was too weak to have another person in
the room with me for five years so I

31
00:01:21,671 --> 00:01:26,671
don't have a person in the room.
My stress levels were off the charts and

32
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,730
the slightest thing would just the
crack.

33
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:33,840
My wife tried to keep me company so we
have this big king size bed and she

34
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:38,841
would lay in bed reading a newspaper and
the sound of the page turning went

35
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:45,111
through me like a cannon ball and she,
it just tore me to pieces and she had to

36
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,380
build a separate room in the front of
the house and live there because I

37
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,790
couldn't tolerate anything.

38
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,120
Did you think it was over?
Yeah.

39
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,520
I thought first of all,
something you don't know,

40
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,440
you have a sense of humanity and you
don't know it and something like this

41
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,750
that wipes out your entire future.
Every dream,

42
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,751
the overhead for yourself robs you of
your sense of humanity and you don't

43
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:14,670
know.
There is a sense of humanity until it

44
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,400
disappears.
So it took me three years.

45
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:21,630
I had to rebuild a personality from just
about scratch.

46
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,600
Wow.
Because of the one area I could handle

47
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,050
at least most of the time was the
internet.

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,050
You know,
the Internet hit the music industry in

49
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:36,051
1983 and I had been lusting after it for
years because only academics had access

50
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:40,400
to this real high tech thing.
And um,

51
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,800
I had,
it took me three years to realize that

52
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:48,000
every day I was trying to go up to my
front room office and work.

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,630
And that sitting was draining me of my
energy.

54
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,970
And since I only had a tiny amount of
energy,

55
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:58,971
if I lay there horizontal in the bed,
my voice eventually come back.

56
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,200
So I had an assistant take two computers
because in those days to computers was

57
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,530
about half the size.
The processing power was half the size

58
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:12,820
of your cell phone.
And I had them hook up two computers and

59
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:15,910
a Chinese box.
Don't let anybody tell you the Chinese

60
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:20,230
and Chinese don't event things they do.
And this was a box that allowed me to

61
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,890
control both computers from one monitor
and one keyboard.

62
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,240
So we have the keyboard up on foam
bolsters so that I could see it when I

63
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:32,500
was laying perfectly horizontal in bed
so I could still see the keys.

64
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,890
And I rebuilt a personality online cause
I couldn't get any further than to the

65
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:39,610
bathroom and back.

66
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,980
That was it.
What do you mean by you rebuilt a

67
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,120
personality?
Well,

68
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,720
everything I hadn't expected.
I mean I was going to write my first

69
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:50,710
book and I was gonna I,
I'm a nerd from science.

70
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:53,920
I got into science at the age of 10 I
got into theoretical physics and

71
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:57,130
microbiology.
I felt built my first Boolean Algebra

72
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:01,570
machine when I was 12 I code is on a
computer that won science fair awards.

73
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:06,571
When I was 12 I was taken to see the
head of the graduate physics department

74
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:10,420
at the University of Buffalo and
disappeared into his office for an hour.

75
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,730
My mother wondered what in the world
that happened to me cause it was

76
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,440
supposed to be a five minute courtesy
call.

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,150
We were discussing big bang versus
steady state theory of the universe for

78
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:22,630
an hour and a half.
When I was 16 I worked at the world's

79
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,590
largest cancer research lab and I came
up with the theory of the beginning,

80
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,030
middle and end of the universe,
the Big Bang theory or the bloom tour,

81
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:34,390
a little model that predicted 38 years
in advanced dark energy.

82
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,160
And then I ended up in the rock and roll
business with this background.

83
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:44,970
So when I imagined I was going to write
my first book,

84
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:47,890
I was going to leave the rock and roll
business behind because my field

85
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,710
expedition and rock and roll,
I'd learned,

86
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,410
I thought as much as I was ever going to
learn from it.

87
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,290
And I'd worked with Michael Jackson,
Prince Bob Marley,

88
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,860
bette Midler,
ACDC Aerosmith,

89
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,290
kiss,
Kiss Queen,

90
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,400
Billy Joel,
billy idol,

91
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,930
Paul Simon,
Peter Gabriel,

92
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,370
David Byrne,
people like that.

93
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,410
What?
What caused this disease?

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,760
Like nobody knows.
Nobody knows.

95
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,290
Nobody has a clue what the,
so in the different names,

96
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,920
chronic fatigue syndrome and ease.
I would just send me a Myalgic

97
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:19,921
encephalomyelitis and more dignified
name do can they understand it into the

98
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:24,330
point where they could test for it.
Did they give you a blood test or they

99
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:27,130
just can't test for it?
They don't know what causes it.

100
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,940
There's no Ivrit.
A friend approached me at one point and

101
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:33,250
said,
the Duchess of Kent has what you have.

102
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,830
Can you write her a letter about how to
manage it?

103
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,420
So instead of a letter I wrote 14 or 16
pages or something like that.

104
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,440
So when people have this,
I send them this pamphlet that explains

105
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,740
how I got out of it,
but we'll work for me is not necessarily

106
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:52,450
gonna work for you or anybody else.
Was it a gradual slipping away of your

107
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:57,451
energy or was it a back gradual?
It happened on March 10th of 1988 so

108
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,880
March 9th you're fine.
March 10th March 9th I'm fine.

109
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,570
March 10th I'm fine.
I fly down to a,

110
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:07,640
I think it was richmond or something
like that to go out.

111
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:09,950
Five to be taken by jeep,
uh,

112
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:13,820
five hours into the countryside to meet
with Linda Womack.

113
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:17,390
That's Sam Cooke's daughter and her
husband,

114
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,390
uh,
Cecil Womack who is broke the rolling

115
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:24,680
stones first hit,
he and his brother and they have this

116
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:28,460
big aircraft hanger sized farm building.

117
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,260
Uh,
it's going to be their home,

118
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,170
but right now they've just had it built.
It's empty,

119
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:36,020
it doesn't have heating yet and it's
March 10th.

120
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,460
It's still the end of winter.
And so we go and pass the sheep and into

121
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,530
this building and there's no furniture
in there.

122
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:46,150
And I sit there and interview them for
five hours and find out that there's

123
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,410
something called a black coal mining
culture.

124
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:51,020
And the Gospel came out of those black
coal mines.

125
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,350
I had no idea that blacks ever got
involved in coal mines,

126
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,020
much less that.
That's how gospel culture began.

127
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,860
And I,
they drove me five hours back to the

128
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:03,920
airport again.
I sat there on the plane with my little

129
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,150
trs,
100,

130
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:09,590
the very first laptop computer,
this little Gizmo that ran off of Aa

131
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:13,330
batteries and um,
and then I forgot my,

132
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,850
my laptop.
On the plane.

133
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,410
I don't do things like that.

134
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,680
Some of that was a little off the next
day I thought I had a cold.

135
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,220
My technique for handling a cold work
your fucking ass off.

136
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,150
Um,
walk a minimum of two and a half miles

137
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:33,230
and do your work.
So I worked in power to my way through

138
00:07:33,231 --> 00:07:35,870
it by Tuesday.
Um,

139
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,290
I was so weak that my staff had a pick
me up under the armpits and drag me off

140
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:46,310
to the elevator and throw me in the back
of a car service car and shipped me out

141
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,740
to parks slope to my brownstone in
Brooklyn.

142
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,290
Guy.
Don't know how I even got up the stairs

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,220
and it was all downhill basically from
there for 15 years.

144
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:57,230
15 freaking years.
Right.

145
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,840
But so,
but I still had,

146
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:02,480
I had gotten halfway through writing my
first book.

147
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,340
My plan was,
okay,

148
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:08,540
I'll do what I've done with all my rock
and roll bands when my book is ready to

149
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,050
come out.

150
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,630
I'll go do every morning television
show,

151
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:15,320
every radio show,
every newspaper in the country.

152
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:19,790
I'll stay at high houses where the
sheets are sunny and yellow and um,

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,790
where they make the bed for you.
You don't have to make it yourself and

154
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,710
they'll feed you food and stuff like
that.

155
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,730
And I'll promote my book.
That was my vision of my next step in

156
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:29,600
life.
My Future.

157
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,390
Well,
if you can't leave your bedroom,

158
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,480
that's all gone.
That's all gone.

159
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,230
And you have to,
and I had to walk into my office one day

160
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,030
and say,
I have no idea of what's happening to

161
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,110
me.
I could be dying.

162
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,680
I have to be out of here in two weeks.
And um,

163
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,820
I gave the whole thing to my staff,
the biggest pr firm in the music

164
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,350
industry.
He just gave it to them.

165
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,780
Yeah.
And the next day I got a call from a

166
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,670
west coast competitor offering me a lot
of money and I had to say,

167
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:57,300
no,
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,940
I gave it to my staff yesterday.
So,

169
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,160
and,
and,

170
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,180
and I say how to reinvent myself with
what little I had.

171
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,070
The books were still a value.
My science was still a value and I had

172
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:16,071
to create a new me online.
Now when you see create a new you online

173
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,130
and you say create a new personality,
what do you,

174
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,270
what exactly do you mean by that?
Well,

175
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,600
I out with your old personality,
old personality,

176
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,050
couldn't walk anymore,
couldn't talk anymore.

177
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,010
Your body.
That was my body.

178
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:34,011
But you have no idea of just how much of
your personality is your body and your

179
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:39,240
vocal cords and stuff like that that you
take for granted are instruments of some

180
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,390
internal you I had to invent an
existence,

181
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:44,310
let's put it that way.
Um,

182
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,870
online.
And how'd you do that?

183
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:47,190
Like when you say,
well,

184
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,680
I got on,
I got on line.

185
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,120
Um,
first I,

186
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,910
God,
I can't even remember what came first,

187
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:55,410
but at some point,
um,

188
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,740
because I was fact checking my first
book,

189
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,500
but how to do this all laying there in
bed.

190
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,690
Um,
I got hold of Napoleon,

191
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:05,430
Sean [inaudible],
who is the,

192
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,520
the anthropologist who chronicled the
fierce people,

193
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:12,480
the Auto Mama in South America.
People who are really,

194
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,580
I mean you,
the more people you kill,

195
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,980
the more wives you get.
It's as simple as that.

196
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,890
And Ya know,
I'm old culture and um,

197
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,010
I wanted him to read my book,
my first book,

198
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:26,220
the Lucifer principle of scientific
expedition into the forces of history.

199
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,391
And he said,
look,

200
00:10:27,391 --> 00:10:29,850
people are out to destroy my career
right now.

201
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:34,710
I can't get involved with anything
controversial but I a key member of the

202
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:37,980
human behavior and evolution society and
you should be a member.

203
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,510
While he introduced me to a social group
in which I could interact as long as I

204
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,560
can continue to type.

205
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,180
So this is a message board or um,
it was all done via email.

206
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,430
So just a,
a group of people that you could

207
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:53,700
interact with with him.
And I've been working on my writing

208
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,790
since I was 16 years old.
Science is my base,

209
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,900
but the book I got at the age of 12 by
Albert Einstein,

210
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,360
you know,
sometimes a book grabs you by the lapels

211
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:06,210
and it feels like the author's writing
this directly into your face.

212
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,000
And Einstein said to be a genius.
It's not enough to come over,

213
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:12,510
come up with a theory.
Only seven men in the world can

214
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,590
understand to be a genius who have to be
able to come up with that theory and

215
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:19,740
then express it so clearly that anyone
with a high school education and a

216
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,230
reasonable degree of intelligence can
understand it.

217
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,360
So Albert Einstein,
my heroes said,

218
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:25,410
schmuck,
listen up.

219
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,260
You want to be on an original scientific
thinker?

220
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,170
You have to be the best writer you can
possibly be.

221
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,830
So I had been working on my writing
since I was 16 years old.

222
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,950
I was late.
[inaudible] took me four years to get

223
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,230
around to doing it.
After Einstein gave me the orders,

224
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:45,830
and I'm one when I was put on the human
behavior and evolutionary society group,

225
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,260
well,
I can write my fucking ass off.

226
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,740
So people were impressed and they
gathered around me.

227
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:58,930
Fortunate.
Now admittedly it's all on a computer

228
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:03,910
screen and it's all via keyboard and
there are no living humans in the room

229
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,970
and he applies.
But it's saved my life to be able to do

230
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,930
that.
And then I found it to international

231
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,800
scientific groups of my own and I wrote
three books because those were things I

232
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:19,690
could do with that keyboard as long as I
have the strength to do the keyboarding

233
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,720
and I didn't always have the strength to
even lift my hands and do that,

234
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,400
but I did most of the time.

235
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,860
Now during this time were you getting
treated?

236
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:30,820
Were doctors giving you doctors don't
know a damn thing about this?

237
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,210
Eventually,
my first wife who I lost because of this

238
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,420
lost a 34 year marriage because of the
illness.

239
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,750
She persuaded a cfs doctor or a doctor
who specializes in chronic fatigue

240
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:47,560
syndrome to come out to my house when he
was going to a party in Brooklyn and see

241
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:51,970
me and the most useful thing that he did
was hand me a piece of paper with an

242
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,720
email address on it and he said,
this is another one of my patients.

243
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,270
She's in Texas.
I want you to get in touch with her.

244
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,610
And the two of us went out like Hansel
and Gretel,

245
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:04,690
holding hands going into the forest,
looking for treatment modalities.

246
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:09,691
We're looking for treatments that might
possibly save us from our illness.

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,450
So when I tell people this stuff,
I take it and they say,

248
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:14,620
okay,
who can I get this room?

249
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,620
And I send them to my doctor,
my old cfs doctor.

250
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,761
He says,
oh,

251
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:22,300
I don't give those treatments.
Well he gave them to me,

252
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,660
but he gave them to me because those
were the things that felt like they

253
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,000
might work and he allowed me to try
them.

254
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,320
And I ended up with a,
every morning I give myself a shot with

255
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:35,710
three different things in it,
a half a cc of magnesium,

256
00:13:35,711 --> 00:13:40,690
one cc of Oxytocin,
and a about two CC's of Santa Cobalamin,

257
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:45,691
which is liquid vitamin B's 12 so b12
magnesium and oxytocin.

258
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:47,860
Oxytocin,
the bonding hormone,

259
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,860
oxytocin,
the stuff that creates trust in

260
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,400
neuroeconomics experiments.
Oxytocin with,

261
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,130
if you're a mother and you've just given
birth to a baby,

262
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,670
when you put that baby to your left
nipple for the very first time,

263
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,210
you feel in some cases like you've just
taken lsd because this chemical goes

264
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:11,641
coursing through your body and it's a
trip and it makes you trust everybody.

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,380
In the room and everybody who walks into
the room,

266
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,590
it's oxytocin and oxytocin.
I've been on oxytocin now for 20 years

267
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,500
and Oxytocin,
it turns out also does something else.

268
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,170
Um,
there's this little experiment called

269
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:31,030
parabiosis taken old rat.
His brain is aging is hard as aging.

270
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,110
His kidneys are aging.
You Hook up the circulatory system to

271
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:38,320
the circulatory system of a young rat.
And guess what starts happening to the

272
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:40,030
old rat.
His brain starts,

273
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,280
we're versing getting,
getting younger.

274
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,340
His heart starts getting younger.
His kidneys start to get younger.

275
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,610
So I'm about to be 75 years old in a
month.

276
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,200
And um,
I do between 400 and 700 pushups in the

277
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:55,070
morning.
First thing,

278
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,740
that's crazy.
That's really crazy.

279
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,950
But when they tried to figure out what
is reversing the aging and the muscles

280
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,590
of the rat,
the heart of the rat,

281
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:10,280
the brain of the rat,
the one ingredient they were able to

282
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,340
isolate and then use on other rats to
get them to get younger instead of older

283
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,660
was oxytocin.

284
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,430
So in all probability,
the reason I can do between 400 and 700

285
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:25,730
pushups in the morning at the age of 74
and when I was 19,

286
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,880
the most I could do was 92 and I was
working really hard at it.

287
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,100
Um,
is the oxytocin,

288
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,730
so never heard of anybody taking that as
a supplement?

289
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,470
Well,
it showed up.

290
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:40,730
There was a doctor named something like
seastrunk in Texas who was using it on

291
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,860
cfs patients.
And my friend,

292
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:45,460
the Texas patient of my doctor,
um,

293
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,650
found seastrunk and got his protocol out
of him.

294
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:51,320
In other words,
exactly what he'd used to treat the

295
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,990
problem.
And we gave it to my doctor and he sat

296
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:57,560
on it for six months until he could
regurgitate it as a own bright idea.

297
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,220
And then,
and then he prescribed it for me and

298
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:05,690
it's done wonders that,
and a bunch of other stuff have done

299
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,520
absolute wonders of the other things
that have worked.

300
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,580
I think Gabapentin without that,
I mean,

301
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:13,340
I was on my way to Moscow once I finally
got out of bed,

302
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,280
I was going to address an international
conference of quantum physicists.

303
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,710
About why everything they know about
quantum physics is wrong.

304
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:22,060
And I was fine.
All,

305
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:26,150
I mean this was my first traveling since
I'd gotten out of bed and it was taking

306
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,540
a huge chance cause it was a huge chance
on throwing me back into bed again.

307
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,140
And I flew all the way to Germany and
was doing just fine.

308
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,600
I was exhilarated that I was doing so
well.

309
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,120
And then halfway between Germany and
Moscow,

310
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,540
the cfs symptoms began to come back and
that was scary.

311
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:46,250
And then I reviewed what I was doing and
I realized I had missed all my afternoon

312
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:51,110
pills and I,
and as soon as I was able,

313
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,830
well we had to find a,
a bed in the infirmary,

314
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,700
which is scary.

315
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,730
And the Moscow airport,
because there are people walking around

316
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:03,530
with machine guns and military uniforms
and they want to take my passport away

317
00:17:03,531 --> 00:17:06,020
in order to allow me to lay in a bed in
the infirmary.

318
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,290
And so I could be disappeared at any
second.

319
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,180
But when we finally got to our hotel and
opened up my drug role,

320
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,840
um,
I took the Gabapentin and within 15

321
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,390
minutes of the symptoms were going,
wow.

322
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,310
So did,
have you ever tried to isolate

323
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:24,650
individual ones?
It removes some of them from the

324
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:29,540
protocol to see if I once removed one
amytriptolene it's an antidepressant.

325
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,170
That's what it was originally designed
for and I figured I don't need this

326
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:35,540
anymore.
I'm perfectly healthy.

327
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,530
It was a big mistake.
I started having these blinding stomach

328
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:43,130
aches and they went out for a low,
I mean for months and months and months

329
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,670
until I finally got fed up and started
researching on Google.

330
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,530
What do you do about summer cakes?
Well,

331
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,140
guess one of the primary things you do
to stop stomach cases,

332
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,500
amitriptyline,
the very thing I had gone off of,

333
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,300
so I had to go back on it.
So it's a whole network,

334
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,830
a mesh of supplements,
drugs and lifestyle.

335
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,920
I don't sleep the way normal people
sleep.

336
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,300
I sleep from four o'clock in the morning
until eight o'clock in the morning.

337
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,540
I get up.
I listened to magazines on the kindle

338
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,050
while I'm taking my bath and shaving and
all that stuff.

339
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,530
I meet with my assistant,
I give her her marching orders for the

340
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,720
day.
I go back to sleep at 11 and I sleep

341
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:27,450
until three,
and then I get up for my second work

342
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:28,920
day.
Um,

343
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,980
and that's when I do all my writing and
all that kind of stuff.

344
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,310
So you do,
you sleep in four hour chunks while you

345
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,140
four hour chunks because that is better
for you.

346
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,530
My body was refusing to do the eight
hour thing.

347
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,120
So one of the first symptoms of,
of cfs is in Somnia.

348
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,110
Okay.
Now Joe,

349
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,050
if your body is refusing to sleep for
eight hours straight,

350
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,250
listen to your body,
give it what the hell it wants.

351
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,310
And so these are the hours my body
demanded.

352
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,650
Um,
and they,

353
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:03,330
I had been working often until eight
o'clock in the morning from roughly 11

354
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:06,780
o'clock at night or something like that
and losing track of time and it was very

355
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:10,410
disorienting.
And once I started this two periods of

356
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,570
sleep a day,
my day stabilized.

357
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,880
Um,
and there's other stuff.

358
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:17,040
I mean listening to Pandora,
you would think,

359
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,720
what does that have to do with your
illness?

360
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,460
Well,
I work at a cafe.

361
00:19:20,461 --> 00:19:24,690
That's a vital part of things because
I'm surrounded by people and I've slowly

362
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:28,710
build community in this cafe,
other workaholic writers like me,

363
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,550
a neuroscientist,
a novel novelist,

364
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:35,760
and all kinds of people who just sit
there and slave away all day.

365
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,730
And,
but I'm listening to Pandora that gives

366
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,710
me a sense of life.
For some reason.

367
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:44,670
It's as it's as positive as an elixir
would be.

368
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,880
Um,
and it gives me a sense of control over

369
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:50,370
my environment.
And I don't hear the conversations going

370
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,830
on around me so I can really focus on my
work.

371
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:56,250
I've written four books this way so far
in cafes,

372
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,040
all of this stuff walking five miles a
day.

373
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,110
I'm in two bursts.
I mean,

374
00:20:01,111 --> 00:20:03,960
there I am going through a meadow in the
middle of a park at night.

375
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,270
Uh,
how many New Yorkers do you know who go

376
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,940
out and walk through a park in the
middle of the night?

377
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,470
Rob's,
yeah,

378
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:11,790
right.
That's what you'd think.

379
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,720
But I have the time of my life looking
up at the stars at Lynn middle of the

380
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:19,920
meadow and being where I'm not supposed
to be and not supposed to go through the

381
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:20,460
park at night.

382
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,920
Well they let you.
Um,

383
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,110
I had been thrown up six times by the
police because I've overseen,

384
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,970
I've overstepped the boundaries.
I've been out there after one o'clock

385
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,490
and they do close the place at one and
throw us all out.

386
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,280
But no,
in New York Lore,

387
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,530
unless you're walking a really big dog,
you do not go out into parks at night

388
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,660
and,
but do you put this whole lifestyle

389
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:47,661
together and it's not just any
individual ingredient that's making me

390
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:52,120
better.
I'm happier than I was when I was 19.

391
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,190
I'm stronger than I walk a lot more
slowly than when I was 19.

392
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,730
But in terms of push ups and other
exercises,

393
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm stronger than I was when I was 19
years old.

394
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,010
That is a crazy journey,
Howard.

395
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,110
That's crazy.
And it's only a part.

396
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:09,670
I mean,
right now I'm co-designing.

397
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,700
So here I hurry.
I'm the guy who worked with Michael

398
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,050
Jackson,
Prince Bob Marley and all of those

399
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:14,860
people.

400
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,700
And I'm co-designing a multiplanetary
mission at Caltech right now.

401
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,900
I'm out here in California to do a
bookstore reading my first one on the

402
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:26,020
west coast for how I accidentally
started the 60s my current book.

403
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,500
But then I have three presentations at
the annual meeting of the National Space

404
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,300
Society and I'm on the board of
governors of the National Space Society

405
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:36,070
and I've got some important things to do
there.

406
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,160
And then they let me sit on the board
meetings.

407
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:43,170
I'm used to be on both the board and the
Board of governors and uh,

408
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,390
there are some important things I need
to help this group accomplish.

409
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,240
And then I go back to New York and get,
hopefully,

410
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:54,241
if I'm lucky and my planes are on time,
I get to New York in time to get some

411
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:59,140
sleep and to get up and do an interview
with a British

412
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,330
filmmaker who's making a film about
Prince.

413
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,300
And meantime,
there's a film being made about my life

414
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,920
called surf the catastrophe.

415
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,250
It's a 60 to 90 minute film and they
finally getting,

416
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,890
after a year of shooting,
they're getting down to the editing and

417
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:19,891
it's a three time grammy winner who is
my director and one of the camera who's

418
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,350
been with us through this whole thing.
Um,

419
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,820
a couple of Sundays ago,
my director got his first or his third

420
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:30,970
grammy,
our Emmy and my,

421
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,630
uh,
one of my cameramen got his second emmy.

422
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,980
So there's all kinds of wild stuff.
I have 15 projects going on at once.

423
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,110
I love that.
Yeah.

424
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,680
I was going to say that it seems like
you get very energized when you talking

425
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:47,020
about the amount of different things
that you're doing all at once.

426
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:49,090
Yeah.
It's just that part of what gives you

427
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:49,924
juice.
Yeah.

428
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,900
Because,
uh,

429
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,950
for whatever reason,
if I refuse to go into any niche,

430
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,430
I refuse to go into one specialization
and see the walls close in on me and get

431
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:01,264
buried there.

432
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,290
And my goal since I was 16 years old and
working at the world's largest cancer

433
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:09,460
research facility has been not to be a
mole digging a hole so deep you can't

434
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:10,960
see anything.
Um,

435
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,420
but to be the eagle flying over the
landscape and taking each of those mole

436
00:23:14,421 --> 00:23:19,421
holes as pick pixels in a big picture.
So I do all the sciences that termed

437
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,730
autod Dec.
Yes.

438
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:24,070
Autodidact.
Well,

439
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,500
I read two books a day from the time I
was 10,

440
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,640
and by the time I got to college I
remember I'm there with the,

441
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,720
at the age of 12 with the head of the
graduate physics department,

442
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:38,560
not just the physics department,
the graduate physics department,

443
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:41,920
and we're talking as equals,
which is really weird.

444
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,620
So pretty weird.
So by the time I got to college,

445
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,150
I ended up with four fellowships in
neuroscience.

446
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,340
I realized that for me,
graduate school would be the Auschwitz

447
00:23:55,341 --> 00:23:56,174
of the mind.

448
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,780
Um,
I felt I was in a box car on my way to

449
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:02,270
the end of everything I wanted to
understand in life.

450
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,290
Why is that?
Well,

451
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:08,291
because since I was 12 or 13 years old,
I want it to take all the panorama,

452
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,010
the full pallet of the sciences,
and I wanted to use them among other

453
00:24:13,011 --> 00:24:15,590
things to understand ecstatic
experiences.

454
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:20,770
I wanted to understand how Hitler put
together this performance torchlight

455
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,440
parades where 15 guys are walking down
the streets abreast of each other,

456
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:28,670
carrying torches at 10 o'clock at night,
and people on the [inaudible] van

457
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,920
Linden,
the big boulevard are packed so tight

458
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:35,330
that if you pulled up your feet,
you wouldn't topple over because the

459
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,210
crowd would hold you up.
They were crowded in on.

460
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:42,790
I was a side of you supporting you and
people had a sense of being lifted out

461
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,970
of themselves and having a transcendent
experience and becoming part of three

462
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:47,720
things.

463
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,720
I invoke one tribe.
I write one state,

464
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm fewer her one leader,
but it gave them,

465
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:01,220
we all need a sense of being a part of
something bigger than ourselves.

466
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,250
I wanted to know how that sense of
ecstatic disillusion into something

467
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:12,410
bigger than yourself happens.
Do you think that we're in Hitler's case

468
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,600
that this was an accident?
No.

469
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,350
I think Hitler,
I think designed this was,

470
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,490
yes,
he did design it.

471
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:22,040
He absolutely,
he knew that he could create this sort

472
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,350
of ecstatic state and in these people,
you bet.

473
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,180
Um,
he was an exotic and he was preaching to

474
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:31,340
people to bring them to a state of
ecstasy.

475
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,710
How did he know all this?
How did he know?

476
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:37,970
All of us,
all this the way any artist knows how to

477
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:40,250
achieve things that he may never have
seen,

478
00:25:40,251 --> 00:25:43,130
achieved before in his life.
It's intuition.

479
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,770
We're all built with certain,
uh,

480
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,650
super normal responses inside of us.

481
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:53,480
Certain gushes of emotion you can hit if
you hit just the right stimulus.

482
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,450
And he hired Albert speer to be as art
directors.

483
00:25:57,451 --> 00:26:01,040
So Albert speer would art direct these
massive events like this,

484
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,250
but it was Hitler who would go into a
state of ecstatic preaching as if

485
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:08,810
preaching in tongues,
but preaching in one tongue,

486
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:11,780
German.
And who could bring that audience to

487
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:14,270
that ecstatic level?
Um,

488
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,220
he was disturb you to study someone as
fucked up as Hitler though,

489
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:22,920
and look for the genius in his approach,
especially as it chooses.

490
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:23,960
Yeah.
You Bet your ass.

491
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,823
Yeah,
of course.

492
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,310
Um,
but I figure if Hitler could use this

493
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:31,400
for evil,
the big trick is to understand it and

494
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,350
use it for good.
And in fact,

495
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:37,760
it turns out that a rock concert has
these ecstatic elements in it.

496
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,970
And you know,
you hear about audiences getting off.

497
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,660
That's what the put people stage are
constantly trying to achieve.

498
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,520
That's an ecstatic state.
Is this what was fascinating to you

499
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:53,420
about rock in the first place that led
you to become a publicist?

500
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:54,270
Right.
Because remember,

501
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:57,060
if I'd gone to Grad School,
I would have been giving paper and

502
00:26:57,061 --> 00:27:01,110
Pencil tests to 22 college students in
exchange for one psychology credit.

503
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:03,120
Now,
how much was I going to learn about mass

504
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,090
x disease?
The forces of history in that college

505
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,690
costs?
Not saying that you,

506
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,190
you had this foresight because for many
people,

507
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:15,450
the idea of going to Grad school and
becoming a professor like that was the,

508
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,570
that was the golden pot at the end of
the rainbow.

509
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,840
And everybody knew I was going to be a
college professor from the time I was 10

510
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:23,400
years old.
But the closer I got to it,

511
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:28,000
the more I realize that this is like
being put in a sardine can and having

512
00:27:28,001 --> 00:27:29,190
the cam welded over you.

513
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,820
Um,
it's,

514
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,500
it's a big mistake.
And,

515
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,790
and I,
I started a commercial art studio with a

516
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,710
bunch of artists that I had worked with.
I,

517
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,290
one day I was in class,
I was,

518
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:47,640
I was very serious about poetry,
poetry set a lot of the tones.

519
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,210
It taught me how to lead a life.
I mean,

520
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:55,230
the love song of j l for proof rock says
shmuck listen up the way that Einstein,

521
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,280
except he doesn't,
I mean,

522
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:58,770
he's an antisemite,
so he's not going to say Schumacher ts

523
00:27:58,771 --> 00:27:59,970
Elliot.
But he said,

524
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,640
listen up.
If you don't start doing the,

525
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,100
the heroic stuff that you feel will
divine,

526
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,420
will define you and bring young women
crawling to your ankles and kissing your

527
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,220
knees.
If you don't,

528
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,340
if you have that in you,
that vision of what you want to be and

529
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:16,800
you don't start it now today,
this hour,

530
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,280
you will put it off and put it off and
put it off.

531
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,910
And when you hit the age of 50,
you'll suddenly realize you don't have

532
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:27,840
the life force.
You don't have the life energy to do

533
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:31,140
that anymore.
And your whole life will have been a

534
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:34,800
failure.
So if you have something heroic to do,

535
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,600
start it now.
So I was in a poetry class cause poetry

536
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:44,601
had had a huge influence on my life.
And one day the poetry teacher,

537
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:48,780
the poet and residents in Nyu said,
bloom when everybody leaves the

538
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:51,510
classroom,
close the door.

539
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,060
I need to talk to,
well that doesn't sound good.

540
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,730
And he said,
okay.

541
00:28:56,731 --> 00:28:58,890
He sat me in the balling out chair and
he said,

542
00:28:58,891 --> 00:28:59,724
look,
you,

543
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,910
last year I asked you to be on the staff
of the literary magazine.

544
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,580
You never even showed up this year.
I'm telling you,

545
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,700
you are the literary magazine.
The minute you walk out that door,

546
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,980
your it,
you don't even have a faculty adviser

547
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,180
now get out the door.

548
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:18,930
So I turned it into an experimental
graphics and literary magazine.

549
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,950
So I knew a bunch of artists and one of
them was being thrown out of his

550
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:24,900
apartment and it was the beginning of
the summer.

551
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,080
Um,
his electricity was about to be cut off,

552
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:31,050
his phone was about to be caught off and
his furniture gallery being repossessed.

553
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:36,051
He and his wife and child were sitting
on a bear rug floor crying when I walked

554
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,850
in and I said,
look,

555
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:41,800
you're a bloody genius.
Give me your portfolio.

556
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,930
I'll take it out for two weeks.
Uh,

557
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:45,610
I'll get you work.
That'll get the,

558
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:50,260
allow you to pay your rent and then I
can move on and get a proper summer job.

559
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,510
While it didn't turn out to be that
easy,

560
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:55,990
by the end of the summer,
I hadn't gotten a single job.

561
00:29:55,991 --> 00:29:58,630
I got in New York magazine,
addressed it and doing a feature on my

562
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,510
art studio,
but I hadn't gotten the artists and the

563
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,520
other artists in the studio a single
job.

564
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,810
And I'm an obsessive compulsive,
so I call Columbia where I was supposed

565
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:10,700
to go to Grad school and said,
um,

566
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,040
you know,
I have a back problem.

567
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:13,780
I won't be showing up this year.
Joe.

568
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,060
The truth at any price,
including the price of your life,

569
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,150
is one of my religious principles.
It's the first rule of science.

570
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,860
The second rule of science is look at
things right under your nose,

571
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,170
noses,
if you've never seen them before.

572
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,540
And then proceed from there.
The truth at any price,

573
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,700
including the price of your life.
Yeah.

574
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,760
So when people tell me,
for example about my book,

575
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:33,280
the Mohammad Code,
how it desert profit brought you isis,

576
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,250
al Qaeda in Boko Haram or Hama Hama and
met and Jihad.

577
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,240
So when people realized I was writing
this,

578
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,440
they said,
you can't write that you'll get killed.

579
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,610
Who the fuck cares?
The first rule of science is the truth

580
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,380
and any price,
including the price of your life.

581
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,260
And if you tell me I can't write it
cause it's gonna get me killed,

582
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,280
I know that it's doubly important for me
to write this because nobody else is

583
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:57,050
going to have the guts to.
So the,

584
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,440
it falls on me.
So screw that.

585
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,793
Um,

586
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,860
you seem to be approaching all these
different things,

587
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,910
whether it is sitting in the cafe
listening to music,

588
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,090
being surrounded by people,
poetry,

589
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,390
uh,
the,

590
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,870
the goal,
the ecstatic state that you were

591
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,720
studying when it comes to Hitler or
rocks,

592
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,900
rock music.
You're seem to be looking at this as

593
00:31:21,901 --> 00:31:26,901
almost like a form of a,
not necessarily uncharted energy but uh,

594
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,090
undocumented as almost as if it's like
there's a,

595
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:38,091
there's fuel out there that you are,
you're tapping into and utilizing that,

596
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:40,770
you know,
that everybody's kind of aware of.

597
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,010
But I don't think they're thinking about
it the same way that you are.

598
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,140
No,
when I'm looking at this in the context

599
00:31:46,141 --> 00:31:49,080
of everything from the big bang to
what's going on in our brains while

600
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:50,850
we're having this conversation in the
future,

601
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:54,360
you and I are fashioning through our
actions at this point.

602
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:56,370
I'm looking at this in terms of very,
very,

603
00:31:56,371 --> 00:32:00,180
very big picture and,
and I get disturbed when it looks like

604
00:32:00,181 --> 00:32:02,850
I'm going to get typed.
Like I've spent so much time on,

605
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,930
on space in the last few years that I'm
afraid people are going to type me.

606
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,680
And I refuse to be typed as the space
guy.

607
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

608
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,370
Because I need to have access to every
field that I can possibly understand

609
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:16,890
because I'm in the process of putting
together a big picture.

610
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,450
When you say you worried about being,
I mean,

611
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:22,210
after all you've accomplished,
how could you be tight?

612
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,720
Oh,
it's real easy.

613
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:28,750
But by who?
But it partly by myself but also by

614
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:30,860
others.
Interesting.

615
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:31,960
By yourself.
Yeah.

616
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,160
You're worried about yourself.
I,

617
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,900
yes,
I absolutely.

618
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,370
In order to be happy I need to be in a
dozen simultaneously.

619
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,300
That's fascinating.
I am much less intense about it,

620
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:48,410
but I share a similar desire to be
fascinated by many different things at

621
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:50,630
the same time.
And you've got to see where they all fit

622
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:52,160
together.
That's the real trick.

623
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,810
And,
and the real,

624
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:55,430
and the tool for this,
for me,

625
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,670
when I was 12 years old,
my parents,

626
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,550
I'd never paid attention in school.
I read two books a day.

627
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:03,620
That's it.
So I read a book on under the desk

628
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,890
teacher who cared about the teacher,
um,

629
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,790
and my parents were going to send me off
to a small private school.

630
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:14,120
But they made me promise to,
to work in school.

631
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,900
I'd never worked in school before and I
forget where I was going with this

632
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:18,790
story,
but,

633
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,590
but there is one experience I had in
this little high school.

634
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:26,591
It's really relevant and that is okay by
the time I'm 16 years old,

635
00:33:26,631 --> 00:33:30,620
I'm going to after the ecstatic
experience for four years in scientific

636
00:33:30,621 --> 00:33:33,050
terms,
when I'm 14 and here about a book called

637
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:35,870
the varieties of the religious
experience by William James.

638
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:39,470
I spend four months looking for a copy
of the book because there is no Amazon

639
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,940
yet.
Um,

640
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,100
and finding books in buffalo isn't that
easy.

641
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,850
Um,
and then I'm 16 and I've been elected

642
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:49,190
the head of the program committee and my
school,

643
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:52,460
the program committee,
this every day starts for the entire

644
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:55,730
student body with a 45 minute morning
session.

645
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,040
And I mc those sessions and I program
two of them.

646
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:05,810
So the juniors come to me and they say,
could we were having a dance?

647
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,910
Could you please advertise our dance for
us?

648
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:12,160
And they don't understand the irony of
what they've just ask.

649
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:14,180
If there's a dance anywhere in Buffalo,
New York.

650
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,040
People want me to park my feet
elsewhere,

651
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,800
preferably in Cleveland or Houston,
Texas.

652
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,610
Um,
and so this is really weird request.

653
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,780
So I put a piece of music on the
turntable behind the stage and I get up

654
00:34:26,781 --> 00:34:29,120
on the stage and I'm incompetent.
I can't dance.

655
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,100
I mean,
I spent a year in dance class.

656
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,630
My parents were trying to make me
normal,

657
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:34,180
didn't work.
Um,

658
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,600
and,
but I dance and it's not like any dance

659
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:41,750
you've ever seen before in your life.
And I see the girl who hates me most,

660
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:46,700
I see her pupils start to dilate.
And then I see all of the pupils,

661
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,870
350 sets of pupils,
700 eyeballs dilating.

662
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:55,790
And then I see their faces melting.
And then it feels as if their energy

663
00:34:55,791 --> 00:35:00,791
coalesces like a big Amoeba and reaches
out a pseudopod in the pseudopod sends

664
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:02,630
itself through me.

665
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,350
And the energy goes up through me as if
I were an empty pipe,

666
00:35:06,351 --> 00:35:11,120
reaches something just above my head.
And His transmogrified utterly

667
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:14,990
transformed and goes back down to the
audience again in a continuous feedback

668
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:18,800
loop.
And I have an auto body experience.

669
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:22,310
I'm convinced that I'm on the ceiling
watching all of this happen,

670
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,850
that I'm not under under any control
from me.

671
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,230
I'm in control of this energy.
And finally when it's all over,

672
00:35:30,231 --> 00:35:33,050
remember these kids do not like me in
this school.

673
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,910
Not at all.
And,

674
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,000
and they do something as if they have
practiced it all their lives.

675
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:41,670
And I know for a fact they have never
done it before.

676
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,040
They surged down to the foot of the
stage.

677
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,180
They pick me up on their shoulders,
they carry me out of the auditory.

678
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,140
They carry me up the walkway to the
building above where we have our

679
00:35:52,141 --> 00:35:52,620
classes.

680
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,170
And then they put me down.
They never did it before.

681
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,680
They never did it afterward.
Not for football stars,

682
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:00,750
not for anything.
That's a scene in a movie.

683
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,490
Well,
I mean it might be.

684
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,710
What is that for me?
I then after,

685
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:05,221
well,
I've been the,

686
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:07,920
after the ecstatic experience by then at
that,

687
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:10,890
that the carves,
the forces of history for four years of

688
00:36:10,891 --> 00:36:13,710
my bloody life.
What did you think you tapped into?

689
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:15,560
Did you,
did you think you had somehow another

690
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,100
manifested this?
No,

691
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:21,120
I,
I knew I tacked into a part of me that's

692
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:21,781
in there.
I mean,

693
00:36:21,781 --> 00:36:24,570
well,
my parents tried to drag me off.

694
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,220
Look,
I,

695
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,850
I have,
we're going back in time.

696
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,280
Let's go back to when I was about to be
13 years old.

697
00:36:29,281 --> 00:36:30,780
Okay.
And,

698
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,020
uh,
and I realized sometime when I was 12

699
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:35,700
and a half years old that I was an
atheist.

700
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,500
I didn't believe in God.
12 and a half.

701
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:38,251
Yeah.
Why,

702
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:40,290
why 12 and a half at 12?
No idea.

703
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,740
I have six months.
It took me two and a half years of

704
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:46,210
reading two books a day.
So at,

705
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,280
but I,
you know,

706
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:50,940
you can sometimes park something just
out of consciousness and a closet of

707
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:53,970
your mind and keep it there.
So I kept it there because I didn't want

708
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:56,010
to miss out on the precedence for my bar
Mitzvah.

709
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,260
And plus it was the only party I was
ever going to be invited to my own Bar

710
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,160
Mitzvah party.
Right.

711
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,550
Who could write you gotta kiss is that,
yeah.

712
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:09,900
So it wasn't until after the Bar Mitzvah
was over and all of the thank you notes

713
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:13,010
had been written a sale.
I was able to,

714
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,440
to admit that I'm an atheist,
so that means that I,

715
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,100
my bar Mitzvah was in June by the time
I'm finished with all the thank you

716
00:37:20,101 --> 00:37:21,030
notes,
it's August.

717
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,430
Well,
what's just around the corner September

718
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,950
and in the Jewish calendar that high
holidays.

719
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:30,300
So my parents tried to drag me off to
high holidays and they get me as far as

720
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:35,190
the street that the synagogue is on.
And then I refused to go any further and

721
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,410
as,
yeah,

722
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,610
well not by now it's 13.
Okay.

723
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,480
And um,
so I'm hanging on to these sturdily

724
00:37:42,481 --> 00:37:47,010
American craftsmen built doors of the
fraser blue car.

725
00:37:47,011 --> 00:37:50,400
My Dad drives and my parents are at my
ankles trying,

726
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,890
spreading my socks,
trying to pull me up toward the

727
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:57,450
synagogue.
And I have a sudden realization Galileo

728
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,400
had his insights by taking these new
fangled devices called lenses,

729
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:04,830
putting them in a tube and pointing the
tube,

730
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:07,470
which was designed to be used for
horizontal viewing.

731
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:11,280
So you could see an army coming over the
horizon towards you long before they

732
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:15,210
could see you.
He takes this tube and he turns it in a

733
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,130
totally unexpected direction up.

734
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,600
And another guy,
Anton van Leeuwenhoek who uses the same

735
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:24,960
high tech devices,
lenses cause he's a draper,

736
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,950
he sells fabric.
So he uses his magnifying glass to see

737
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:33,390
how tight the weavers and as fabric.
And his great innovation is to take

738
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:38,391
these lenses and turn down and look at
pond water and look at his own sperm.

739
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,080
Um,
and I suddenly had this realization why

740
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,240
parents are shredding my socks and
trying to drag me up to the synagogue.

741
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,320
There are no gods in the heavens.
There are no gods beneath the earth.

742
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,650
So where are the gods right now in this
scene?

743
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:58,651
There in my parents and they are,
are tugging with astonishing force at my

744
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:01,690
parents and my socks.
And if there,

745
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:04,540
if the gods or in my parents,
then the gods are in me too.

746
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,610
So my task in life is going to be to
take that lens that Galileo churned up

747
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,640
and that van Leeuwenhoek turned down and
turn it within to find the gods inside

748
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:18,340
of us,
meaning finding those ecstatic

749
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:23,341
experiences and that dance experience
was the most primal of these ecstatic,

750
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,870
you could call them spiritual
experiences,

751
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,730
but for me it's sexual,
sexual,

752
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,140
secular,
sorry,

753
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,360
spirituality.

754
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:39,140
I got sex on the brain.
But that was the,

755
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:43,580
that was the closest I was going to get
to what Hitler had summon forth.

756
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,510
Those speeches that Hitler gave,
I don't understand German,

757
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:52,310
but there the intensity that he was
giving these speeches out,

758
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:57,170
and I've seen this before with radical
Islam speakers or with,

759
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:59,390
you know,
many different religious leaders.

760
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,940
There's something about what they're
doing that is,

761
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,220
it's almost contagious.
Like you,

762
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,260
you,
you see whatever there,

763
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,410
the energy that they're putting out,
it's so compelling.

764
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,770
It's,
it's a bizarre thing that human beings

765
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:16,680
have this,
this compulsion to pay attention to

766
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,910
people that have achieved this extreme
level of performance.

767
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,370
Well because they seen locked into a
truth.

768
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,280
That truth speaks to itself through
every muscle of their body.

769
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,990
Confident,
right?

770
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,350
Like the preacher on stage shouting out
to the heavens.

771
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:34,590
And if you're that confident to have
that much energy and conviction,

772
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,270
there must be some truth to what you're
saying

773
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,950
and there is a good chance that you are
having a kind of out of body experience

774
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:43,310
of one kind or another because something
deeper inside of you takes you over and

775
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:46,280
performs through you.
It's not you,

776
00:40:46,281 --> 00:40:49,730
but of course it is you.
So if you were going to come to me when

777
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,060
I was in the rock and roll business and
you want it to be my client,

778
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,010
I would give you a lecture.
I would say you have to understand

779
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:01,010
something.
If you are coming to me to fashion and

780
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:06,011
image to brand you and to make you a
superstar,

781
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:11,150
I'll get you an appointment immediately
within the hour with my best competitor.

782
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,710
Um,
but if you're going to work with me,

783
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:20,030
you have to understand that music is not
an exchange of pieces of plastic.

784
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:23,300
It is not an exchange of downloads.
It is not an exchange of money.

785
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,420
It's not about markets and branding and
all of that stuff.

786
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,130
Music is about an exchange of human
soul.

787
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,760
When you sit in front of a blank piece
of or two o'clock in the afternoon to

788
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:37,070
write a lyric,
you know you can never write a lyric

789
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,070
again cause you have no idea of how
you've ever written lyrics in the past

790
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,610
and at four o'clock in the afternoon,
very often there's a lyric there.

791
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,810
My job is to find the self inside you
who wrote that lyric and introduce it to

792
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:50,030
the self that says hello.
How are you?

793
00:41:50,031 --> 00:41:51,680
Fine,
thank you very much and all the

794
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:56,570
ritualistic aspects of life.
When you go on stage you have the kind

795
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:59,000
of experience that I had.
You

796
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,830
are out of your own body,
your danced around as if you were a

797
00:42:03,831 --> 00:42:07,610
marionette.
You feel a 17,000 souls coursing through

798
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:11,660
you to something higher being
transmogrified and channeling back to

799
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:13,430
those people and a continuous loop.

800
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,430
My job is to find that soul inside of
you,

801
00:42:16,431 --> 00:42:19,640
the dances you on stage and introduce it
to the self of hello,

802
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,290
how you find.
Thank you very much.

803
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,400
So if you're willing to give me six
weeks to study you and then come out to

804
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:29,420
your environment and see you in your
environment for anywhere from one to

805
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,930
three days,
my job is secular shamanism.

806
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:37,100
Find that fucking soul that dances and
hang out with them.

807
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,640
I have not really hang out.
It would be a very intense interview

808
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,040
with John Mellencamp.
We started at nine o'clock in the

809
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:45,080
morning at his home in Seymour,
Indiana.

810
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,510
We finished at four o'clock in the
afternoon.

811
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,481
John,
look,

812
00:42:48,481 --> 00:42:51,410
the way that he only looked when he came
off stage,

813
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,830
he looked hollowed out.
He looked like a scarecrow.

814
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,330
Um,
he had empty caverns where his eyes

815
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:01,160
should have been.
He was wiped.

816
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:06,230
He was totally wiped.
And that interview allowed me to find

817
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:10,100
the authentic John Mellencamp and preach
it to the press and turn depressed who

818
00:43:10,101 --> 00:43:12,650
hated John Mellencamp around why they
hate him.

819
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:18,070
They hated him because he had signed
with Tony to freeze who was managing

820
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,310
David Bowie.
And Tony Jeffries thought that his magic

821
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:26,720
came from changing of people's names.
David had dave go a been named David

822
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Jones and he changed it to Bowie.
And so he called John Johnny coover and

823
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,780
then he did something,
it sounds devilishly clever,

824
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,390
but was the opposite of clever.
He,

825
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:43,550
um,
had a book made with one page on each of

826
00:43:43,551 --> 00:43:47,900
all of the dominant critics of the day.
One page,

827
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,560
a picture,
a little write up on each of them and

828
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,590
the press perceive this as trying to buy
them and they don't like being bought.

829
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,360
Um,
so they rebelled.

830
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,210
And the word went out in the press that
John Cougar was a Prek,

831
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:07,010
that he was just an obnoxious,
horrible human being and that his music

832
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:07,844
was crap.

833
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:12,590
And so even my friend can emerson,
my impression from Ken,

834
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,830
Ken was at that point,
the record reviews editor for rolling

835
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:19,370
stone and eventually he'd be an editor
at the New York Times Sunday magazine,

836
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:24,550
a very influential magazine nationwide.
And my impression was the Caen wrote his

837
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:31,331
review of John's album without ever
opening the shrink wrap without ever

838
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,230
listening to it because everybody was
assumed in that community that you knew

839
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,260
what John's music was crap.
And you know what,

840
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:44,250
his personality was crap.
And if you open the album and listen to

841
00:44:44,251 --> 00:44:46,590
it,
you would be expelled.

842
00:44:46,591 --> 00:44:49,500
People would shun you at the next
launch.

843
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,130
They wouldn't want you there or the next
Shinar even listened to it.

844
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,680
Yeah,
exactly.

845
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,160
You just,
you had to,

846
00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:01,020
the group think had been established.
I'm pure pressure is tremendous within

847
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,900
the rock crit or was tremendous within
the rock critic.

848
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,230
Stablish um,
the rock among the rock critics and it

849
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:09,480
goes up so much power back then,
so crazy,

850
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,660
but they were so rigidly conformity and
forest.

851
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,690
Now this wasn't unique to the 1970
[inaudible] and 1980s because Carlisle,

852
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:22,260
the social commentator,
Thomas Carlyle and England and

853
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:27,290
approximately 1832 wrote about the pop
culture critics of his day and his day

854
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,990
pop culture was novels and plays and
how,

855
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:38,991
and he compared them to sheep.
And he explained how if you take a cane

856
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,760
and you put it out with the sheep
walking single file,

857
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:44,850
you can get 2000 sheep all walking in
single file.

858
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,450
And if you put your cane out in front of
lead sheep on the lead sheet,

859
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:51,060
jumped over your cane and then you
withdrew the cane.

860
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:56,540
Every one of the other 4,999 sheep would
jump at precisely the same spot even

861
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:01,770
though there was nothing to jump over
anymore.

862
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,520
Well,
that's how I perceived the rock crit

863
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,160
elite and my job was to turn them
around.

864
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,360
But my job was also to see true
ecstatics like prince,

865
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,620
like John Michael Jackson was not an
ecstatic onstage.

866
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,910
Michael Jackson wasn't incredible
astonishing performer who had studied

867
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,070
his craft from the age of nine.
And so he worked out every single move

868
00:46:26,071 --> 00:46:27,360
and advance.
John,

869
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:30,360
you never knew from one night to the
next what prince or John Mellencamp

870
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:33,600
we're going to do in performance.
They didn't know how well did you know

871
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:36,330
Michael Jackson?
I thought very,

872
00:46:36,331 --> 00:46:39,780
very well and he was the most remarkable
person I've ever met in my life.

873
00:46:39,781 --> 00:46:42,510
And when I tell people how remarkable,
they don't believe me,

874
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:44,280
he was,
you know,

875
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,510
and I and Jamie are on a certain level
and we don't know we're on a certain

876
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,640
level because we figured these are the
range.

877
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:55,080
This is the range of humanity.

878
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:57,360
Um,
if we go out and meet anybody on the

879
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:00,720
street or even anybody famous,
I work with Buzz Aldrin these days,

880
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,780
what we're going to encounter is another
person pretty much like costs.

881
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,720
Sorry.
In Michael Jackson's case,

882
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,110
he did not fit on this normal plain at
all.

883
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,560
He was on a plane somewhere where you've
never seen a human being before.

884
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,920
So the first time I met him,
we were at his brother Marlin's

885
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,230
have pool house.
It's a little house with just enough

886
00:47:25,231 --> 00:47:29,590
room for one big room on the first floor
and another big room on the second with

887
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:33,970
a little tiny staircase between them.
And there's a billiard table in the

888
00:47:33,971 --> 00:47:36,130
middle of the room.
And there were arcade games,

889
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:39,670
which at that point in particular in
1983,

890
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,040
um,
were unattainable.

891
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,040
No human could afford arcade games.
Um,

892
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,430
unless you were Steve Wynn and you were
actually equipping in arcade.

893
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,960
Um,
so we're in the middle.

894
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,670
We're in this room and Michael and I are
standing next to each other,

895
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:59,671
so his elbow is at his left elbow is at
my right elbow.

896
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:05,190
His left knee is at my right knee and we
have a meeting with the art director

897
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:07,870
from CBS.
I'm condensing the story,

898
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:11,350
there's lots more,
but we're having a meeting with the art

899
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:14,830
director and she walks in with five of
the most gorgeous portfolios you've ever

900
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:16,960
seen in your life.
Hand carved cherry wood,

901
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:21,640
hand carved leather.
And these are from guys I know because I

902
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:24,010
was,
I started in pop culture in the art

903
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:27,400
business and these were my legendary
competitors.

904
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:32,910
And um,
and Michael opens the first page of the

905
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:36,190
first portfolio and he gets a square
inch into it,

906
00:48:36,191 --> 00:48:39,820
a postage stamp size piece into it.
And he goes,

907
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:44,110
oh.
And his knees began to buckle and he

908
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:48,700
gets another two square inches into it
just lifts the page a little bit

909
00:48:48,701 --> 00:48:49,534
further.

910
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:52,960
Oh,
he lifts it an even further.

911
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,070
Oh,
Michael is seeing the infinite in the,

912
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,180
the things that even the artist didn't
see it with such infinity as Michael is

913
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,210
singing.
And by the time he gets to the full

914
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:07,630
page,
he's having a full scale aesthetic

915
00:49:07,631 --> 00:49:10,720
orgasm.
I have never seen anything like this in

916
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:11,950
my life.
And remember,

917
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:14,920
the first two rules of science are the
truth at any price,

918
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:17,230
including the price of your life.
And look at things,

919
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:20,440
run under right under your nose as if
you've never seen them before.

920
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:23,560
And then proceed from there.
Michael is seeing the infinite in the

921
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:28,030
tiniest of things and you've never seen
a human with this degree of awe,

922
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,850
wonder,
and surprise anywhere in your life.

923
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:35,050
And I will never see another human like
that again in my lifetime.

924
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,680
Michael was beyond belief,
utterly beyond belief and his commitment

925
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:42,400
to his audience,
to his,

926
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,830
the people he called his kids.
Oh God,

927
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,270
I forgot to turn this off.

928
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,980
Uh,
have to call.

929
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,660
Um,
so let's find,

930
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:54,970
of course you're an android guy too.
Yes.

931
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:56,290
Uh,
Oh God.

932
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:59,590
How do we,
I know we pulled down from here.

933
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,430
I'm an incompetent with this stuff.
How could you be a people for people who

934
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:06,190
don't see you right now?
Because a lot of people are listening.

935
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,830
He has literally a Batman utility belt.
Um,

936
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,340
with two Kendall's you have to kindle
strapped to you at all times,

937
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,590
right?
You have the headphones for the podcast

938
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:21,340
and I have spare,
I have a total of three pair of

939
00:50:21,341 --> 00:50:25,300
headphones on me because they were out
so quickly and they're going to need to

940
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:26,470
replace them.
Yeah.

941
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:28,180
What are you doing with them too?
No,

942
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,620
I'm petting dogs and that yanks them
around.

943
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,280
Uh,
the,

944
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,440
the,
the best quality sound that I've been

945
00:50:33,441 --> 00:50:35,840
able to get is in $8 headphones.
Well,

946
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:37,050
that doesn't make any sense.

947
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:41,360
It's extraordinary sound.
It's just that the wiring goes why,

948
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:43,670
why,
why is it the best quality sound?

949
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:47,600
Those cheap ass headphones.
It has the best quality base that I've

950
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:50,300
ever gotten worse.
Even though the ones that are like

951
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,180
straight wires with clear covers,
I'm going,

952
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:56,570
I actually get very annoyed when apple
got rid of the microphone.

953
00:50:56,571 --> 00:51:00,260
Jack The headphone Jack on their phone.
While I would be annoyed too.

954
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,370
Yeah.
Because of that.

955
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,590
Such a high quality sounds.
Right.

956
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,560
So I'm surrounded with Electronica,
but when it comes to my phone,

957
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,010
my phone,
and I do not agree on what a command is.

958
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:13,370
So whenever,
well when I tried to pick up the phone

959
00:51:13,371 --> 00:51:18,230
and answer it and hangs up when I'm not
trying to do anything on the phone,

960
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:21,320
it interprets that as a hand gesture of
some sort and does something.

961
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,440
Which one are you using?

962
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,370
The Samsung note eight.
Oh,

963
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,520
okay.
Well,

964
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,960
you know,
some people think that Samson's uh,

965
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,870
got a little bit of bloatware and their
songs.

966
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,900
Since you're an android guy,
have you ever considered using like a

967
00:51:32,901 --> 00:51:35,920
google pixel two like,
well I like,

968
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,440
I like a big screen pixel,
two xl,

969
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:43,730
a six inch screens.
That would be very neat.

970
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,620
6.2 would be terrific.
It also,

971
00:51:45,621 --> 00:51:48,470
when you squeeze the sides,
Google assistant pops up.

972
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:49,311
Yeah.
Yeah.

973
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:51,620
You squeeze the sides and he gets
started asking a question.

974
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,960
Well,
I need to find one that is also got the

975
00:51:53,961 --> 00:51:56,480
headphone Jack on the top.
They don't have a headphone Jack.

976
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,150
Google got rid of the headphone Jack.
Oh my God.

977
00:51:59,151 --> 00:52:00,230
No,
that's what I'm saying.

978
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,870
Because if you use,
if you use Bluetooth,

979
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,680
right,
if it's tuned to your cell phone,

980
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:11,540
you can't tune it to your kindle and you
can't tune it to your laptop.

981
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:15,140
And I need to be able to switch between
those three devices simultaneously.

982
00:52:15,141 --> 00:52:18,650
Right.
So do you have that kindle fire hd

983
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:22,880
application where you can listen to it
and then as you're reading it,

984
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:24,530
it picks up back where you were
listening?

985
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,500
Well it does.
It's supposed to do that,

986
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:31,850
but sometimes it really wimps out and
takes me 30 pages a far away from where

987
00:52:31,851 --> 00:52:34,130
I was reading.
And it becomes hard to find where I was

988
00:52:34,131 --> 00:52:35,710
reading.
I mean,

989
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,370
you know,
this is why I curse jeff visas.

990
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,430
I hope he knows what he's doing in space
better than he knows what he's doing

991
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:41,960
with the kindle hdx.
Well,

992
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:46,340
I just don't think he could possibly
know all the things he's doing,

993
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,110
you know?
But you'll hire good people who do know

994
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:50,480
those things and,
and he's supposed to be cheap.

995
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,210
Like in terms of like how he pays
workers at the Amazon fact.

996
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,140
I would imagine that when it comes to
blue origin,

997
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:59,630
his rocket company,
that he is not cheap.

998
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,220
Oh,
I didn't even know he had a rocket

999
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,750
company.
He has a rocket company.

1000
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,160
Elon Musk.
Yeah.

1001
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:05,240
Look at you over these,
Jeff.

1002
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:10,300
He thinks that he thinks that that space
x and Elon Musk are the hair and he's

1003
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:14,630
the tortoise,
so he has launched a rocket,

1004
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,260
the same rocket eight times now and
landed it again.

1005
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,081
Really?
Yeah.

1006
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:20,600
Same rocket.
The same rocket.

1007
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:26,050
So he's demonstrated multiple reuse.
The problem is that his rocket can't,

1008
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:28,560
you can only get to the fringes of
space.

1009
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,590
It can't really get into orbital space
is right here.

1010
00:53:31,591 --> 00:53:33,570
Jamie just pulled it up.
You could look at it right there.

1011
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:36,110
That's it.
Wow.

1012
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,800
It's a real,
that's a real,

1013
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,480
Jamie,
what does it look fake?

1014
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:41,850
You haven't seen it before.
I don't know.

1015
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,570
It doesn't look like Cgi U.
I sound like Eddie Bravo.

1016
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,680
So it could be,
but he's actually launched this thing

1017
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:51,390
eight times.
What's with the golf ball inside of

1018
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:53,370
there?
I have no clue.

1019
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:57,120
It's probably demonstrating that it,
that it's weightless.

1020
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:00,360
Really extraordinary time of super
genius.

1021
00:54:00,361 --> 00:54:01,350
Dude,
incredible shit.

1022
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:03,900
And this is how it lands.
It lands the same way.

1023
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,520
That's exactly it.
Got It.

1024
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,830
That's incredible.
And Elan says,

1025
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:12,270
you know that Ellen has been landing his
rockets and he wants to read and he's

1026
00:54:12,271 --> 00:54:15,210
been reusing him.
I think he's done 11 reuses so far,

1027
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:18,090
something like that.
But Elana sang that he's going to get so

1028
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:23,091
precise in his landings that the rockets
will land precisely on the brackets from

1029
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:26,430
which they took off.
Wow.

1030
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,990
Yeah.
So,

1031
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:30,120
and I was on the same pad.
I mean,

1032
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:32,460
yeah,
it was a fairly small pad that the

1033
00:54:32,461 --> 00:54:35,130
Bayzos rocket,
so basis is a very well controlled

1034
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:38,850
rocket Elan's you saw after the Falcon
heavy launch,

1035
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:44,120
the pictures of the two boosters landing
simultaneously within a hundred yards of

1036
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:45,564
each other.

1037
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:49,260
You have to bring that up sometime
because it's an astonishing,

1038
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,150
I like psychosis.
The Amazon prime videos they're putting

1039
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:55,830
out there,
putting out some really great shows.

1040
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,400
They're putting out a lot of standup
comedy now as well.

1041
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,230
Right.
Which they're trying to somewhat compete

1042
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,750
with Netflix.
And if you have a fair,

1043
00:55:03,751 --> 00:55:08,650
it is right there.
One of those heavy,

1044
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,250
well that's,
that's it.

1045
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,990
That's the money shot.
Yeah.

1046
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:15,080
Wow.
That's critical for landing

1047
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:16,800
simultaneous.
It's unbelievable.

1048
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:20,430
So the goal here is up until now,
NASA,

1049
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,850
which has been dumbed down so much,
it's ridiculous by Congress in the

1050
00:55:23,851 --> 00:55:27,390
Senate because Congress in the Senate or
insist on designing their own rockets

1051
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:31,590
and ordered reus jobs programs not to
get us to space.

1052
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:33,920
Um,
is that what the problem is?

1053
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:35,430
It's is,
it's a funding issue too,

1054
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:37,410
right?
It's like you have to have immediate

1055
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:40,380
results for the amount of money that you
put the worse than that.

1056
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,060
The,
there's a little thing called the

1057
00:55:42,061 --> 00:55:44,690
Alabama Mafia.
It's a bunch of senators and congress

1058
00:55:44,691 --> 00:55:46,910
from,
from Texas and Colorado and Ms

1059
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,210
Mississippi and all of the states that
have rocket jobs and they have designed

1060
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:55,560
a rocket called the space launch system
and it's going to cost $30 billion to

1061
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,870
design it.
And it's a throwaway rocket.

1062
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,990
So it's going to cost one to $2 billion
for each flight.

1063
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:03,310
You think this is intentional?
Um,

1064
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,920
it's intentionally,
yes.

1065
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:06,750
It's intentionally stupid.
He thinks that,

1066
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,990
yeah,
because it's designed for jobs and the

1067
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:13,860
result is we Americans haven't had
access to space on American made

1068
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:17,040
vehicles since 2011 that's a long time
now.

1069
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:20,970
Um,
when we do get access to me and space is

1070
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:23,530
going to come from Ilan mosque,
it's not going to come from any of the

1071
00:56:23,531 --> 00:56:24,160
major space

1072
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,440
companies.
And $3 billion a year is sunk into the

1073
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:30,730
space launch system.
This Turkey and another Turkey called

1074
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:33,220
the Orion.
And that's money that needs,

1075
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:38,250
we need that money to actually designed
the habitats on the moon design mining

1076
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:43,450
equipment to mine the ice on the moon
and turn it into a rocket fuel and

1077
00:56:43,451 --> 00:56:48,451
breathable oxygen and drinkable water.
And there are tons of things we need,

1078
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:52,000
but NASA is not producing them because
it's trying to compete with Elon and

1079
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,350
Jeff,
Ilan and Jeff.

1080
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:54,100
No,
he secret.

1081
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,320
If I volunteered to fly you to New York
City,

1082
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:59,200
and I told you I'm going to do this for
free,

1083
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:02,050
I'm not going to charge you a penny.
All you have to pay or the expenses.

1084
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,320
And then I bought you a Boeing seven 37
for $325,000 and allowed you and one

1085
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:14,050
friend to get into this thing.
And then I flew you to New York and then

1086
00:57:14,051 --> 00:57:19,051
I flew the plane out into the Atlantic,
over the Atlantic and plowed it into the

1087
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:20,433
Atlantic Ocean and discarded it.

1088
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,800
Now when,
but I'm doing this all without charging

1089
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:28,300
you anything you realize.
So when you want to fly back from New

1090
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:31,480
York to California,
I'll buy you another seven 37 and other

1091
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:35,620
$325,000 um,
and fly you back.

1092
00:57:35,621 --> 00:57:39,100
And then I'll fly the seven 37 out over
the Pacific and I,

1093
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:42,250
we'll ditch it.
This is the way we do space it NASA

1094
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:45,340
right now.
So how much would it cost you per ticket

1095
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,720
for you and a friend to go from La to
New York and back again?

1096
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:55,500
Approximately $325,000 per ticket.
How often would you fly from New York

1097
00:57:56,861 --> 00:57:58,330
to,
from La to New York?

1098
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:01,420
Not very often,
if ever.

1099
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,230
So that's what NASA is doing with the
space launch system.

1100
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:08,470
And it's gobbling up so much money.
There's no funding left for the stuff we

1101
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:10,570
really need to do.
Do you think it would be better if they

1102
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:12,850
just privatized the entire venture?

1103
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,870
It would be better if they offered word
called cots programs where you ask

1104
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:21,871
companies to bid on getting a rocket
wherever you want it to go and doing

1105
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,100
with that rock up whatever you want it
to do.

1106
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:29,520
And then let Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos
and united launch alliance,

1107
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,380
which is a big company underwritten by
the government,

1108
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:35,380
that is a,
I can never remember the names of the

1109
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:37,360
companies,
but it's Boeing and Lockheed Martin

1110
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,680
combined and allow them all to bid on
this.

1111
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:44,260
Um,
because Ilan is going to bring it in for

1112
00:58:44,261 --> 00:58:48,040
a 10th the cost.
Elon has developed the falcon heavy for

1113
00:58:48,041 --> 00:58:52,180
approximately $2 billion.
He's developed all of his rockets for

1114
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:54,220
approximately $2 billion for all of
them.

1115
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,680
It's costing NASA $30 billion to develop
a Turkey now.

1116
00:58:58,681 --> 00:58:59,514
Well,
how do they,

1117
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:05,020
how do they keep doing that in the face
of these guys like Elon Musk and Jeff

1118
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,240
Bezos,
congressmen and senators don't care.

1119
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,360
They simply want to maintain the jobs in
their districts.

1120
00:59:10,361 --> 00:59:12,610
Plus,
if they feed the Smick,

1121
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:17,080
the space military industrial complex,
the space military industrial complex

1122
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,040
will kickback contributions to their
campaign funds.

1123
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,820
Hmm.
As a result,

1124
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,290
right.
So this is a,

1125
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:27,500
an evil spiral.
I'm buzz Aldrin calls these,

1126
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:31,590
the darth vader's of space for Lockheed
Martins and Northrop Grumman,

1127
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:35,000
the big aerospace swoop,
traditional aerospace contractors.

1128
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,710
So,
um,

1129
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:41,450
it congressmen set a certain number.
It's a cabal of senators and Congressmen

1130
00:59:41,451 --> 00:59:44,270
who are screwing us up because a
country,

1131
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:48,500
a country that dreams big gets big.
A country that looks up,

1132
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,110
goes up,
a country that looks down,

1133
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,350
goes down.
We've covered,

1134
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,380
we become accustomed to looking down
because we don't have that glorious

1135
00:59:56,691 --> 00:59:58,880
option.
The moon is way behind us.

1136
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:00,620
Um,
Baas and,

1137
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:04,400
and Neil Armstrong walking on the moon,
that's a long time ago.

1138
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:07,760
That's two generations,
two and a half generations ago.

1139
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:13,240
And kids in America have lost that dream
of creating a paradise above the sky

1140
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,480
because NASA is a mandan them and it's
mass has been forced to abandon them by

1141
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:22,440
these congressmen and senators who steal
this money from the NASA budget.

1142
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:24,690
But if that money were used,
look,

1143
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,280
that $3 billion a year would mean that
you could develop an entire Elon musk

1144
01:00:29,281 --> 01:00:33,090
pace club program and launch roughly 20
rocket.

1145
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,240
That is the issue.
The,

1146
01:00:34,241 --> 01:00:36,370
the actual engineers and the scientists
themselves,

1147
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:38,930
I mean they must know it's politicians,
right?

1148
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:41,920
But the politicians,
are they able to dictate what the actual

1149
01:00:41,921 --> 01:00:43,930
scientists and engineers create job?
Say,

1150
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,750
Hey,
you must create something that is

1151
01:00:46,751 --> 01:00:48,600
disposable.
Yes.

1152
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,160
Did they,
is that really a conversation that's

1153
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:52,810
taken place?
He asked me,

1154
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:54,750
guys have said,
okay,

1155
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,570
we want to use um,
a space shuttle,

1156
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:01,680
leftover space shuttle technology and
we,

1157
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:04,260
and they,
they've mapped out the specifications of

1158
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:06,590
the rocket that they want.
These guys are doing.

1159
01:01:07,020 --> 01:01:08,070
Yes,
that's right.

1160
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:09,300
How's that possible?
Oh,

1161
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:11,370
it's easy.
That seems disgusting.

1162
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,340
They control the budget.
And one of the treks that the Smith,

1163
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:19,350
the space military industrial complex is
known for a long time is you try to

1164
01:01:19,351 --> 01:01:21,840
parcel our jobs to as many states as
possible.

1165
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,440
So major programs like the latest a
fighter,

1166
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:29,490
um,
that the air force,

1167
01:01:29,491 --> 01:01:33,360
the navy are being told to use.
Um,

1168
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:37,290
those represent jobs and roughly 45
states each.

1169
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:43,470
That means that if your Lockheed Martin
and you want to keep your contract for a

1170
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:48,471
plane that people are claiming can lose
to a 1951 era mig,

1171
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,020
um,
all you have to do is hit the

1172
01:01:52,021 --> 01:01:56,370
congressmen and senators from those 47
states and they'll all back you.

1173
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,750
Why?
Because they're counting on your

1174
01:01:57,751 --> 01:02:00,330
campaign contributions.
Where are you going to get the money to

1175
01:02:00,331 --> 01:02:05,331
give them a campaign contributions from
that billion to $3 billion nipple per

1176
01:02:05,491 --> 01:02:08,780
year,
that NASA has been forced to extend to

1177
01:02:08,781 --> 01:02:11,400
you or that the air force has been
forced to extend to you?

1178
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:15,330
It's a very corrupt system.
That's a dirty system and it means that

1179
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:20,331
the Russians and the Chinese can develop
equivalent aircraft for for one 10th the

1180
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:25,080
price and deliver them for one 10th the
price would be mean.

1181
01:02:25,081 --> 01:02:27,360
You're totally talking about two super
geniuses,

1182
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,780
Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.
Imagine where it would be if they didn't

1183
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:33,150
exist and exactly.
The odds are very high that they

1184
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:34,230
wouldn't exist.
Uh,

1185
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:36,840
the odds are very high that somebody
could do away with them.

1186
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,940
It would be fairly easy.
Hey,

1187
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:40,250
don't even put that out there.
Yeah.

1188
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Well the man on Friday or Sunday at the
National Space Society's annual event,

1189
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,550
I'm talking about China's new Silk Road
versus America's highway in the sky.

1190
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,880
The new Silk Road,
the Chinese government's going to put in

1191
01:02:53,881 --> 01:02:57,300
$1 trillion.
It's total of a $20 trillion project.

1192
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,770
It pulls together something like 66
countries and 3.3 billion people.

1193
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:06,660
And I co founded and chaired something
called the Asian Space Technology Summit

1194
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:11,460
in Kuala Lumpur last May,
just about exactly a year ago.

1195
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:16,910
And it was obvious being in Malaysia
that China has bought Malaysia's heart

1196
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,550
that Americans don't count for much
anymore because the Chinese are already

1197
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:26,130
spending money.
They already own 15 to 20 ports.

1198
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:30,660
They own 15 to 20 ports puramus which is
the port of Athens,

1199
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:34,050
the city that was the cradle of western
civilization.

1200
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,800
Guess who owns it?
The Chinese and they are upgrading these

1201
01:03:37,801 --> 01:03:42,420
ports to do things that no port we've
ever seen before has been able to do so

1202
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:46,080
because they have a big vision,
a really big vision.

1203
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,300
They're going to dominate the 21st
century.

1204
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,660
The 20th was the American Century.
This is going to be the Chinese century

1205
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:55,950
unless we counter with an equally big
vision and the big visions are not

1206
01:03:55,951 --> 01:04:00,390
coming from Donald Trump in Washington
dc or from senators and congressmen.

1207
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,330
They are coming from precisely the
people you fingered.

1208
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:07,050
They're coming from Washington,
they're coming from California.

1209
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:09,390
They're coming from Elon Musk and Jeff
Bezos,

1210
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:14,280
the two guys who can save us by opening
a platinum highway in the sky.

1211
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,950
What does that mean?
A platinum highway in the sky means the

1212
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,720
space economy.
One meteor called something like a amen.

1213
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,750
Three 35 has more resources than the
gross domestic product of England,

1214
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:34,610
France,
Italy and South Korea combined in one

1215
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,810
meteor.
Meteor I want,

1216
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:40,500
I forgot to throw in India.
India is in that list too combined.

1217
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:43,050
So it was the idea to minus mean you're
the last on it.

1218
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,310
Yes,
exactly.

1219
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,020
Another extract resources.
Yes,

1220
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:49,080
bring them back.
But if NASA seriously wants us to

1221
01:04:49,081 --> 01:04:51,780
develop that space economy,
they have to do their part.

1222
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:56,160
They have to,
Elan and jeff are bringing the rockets

1223
01:04:56,161 --> 01:05:01,050
to the table right now.
Reusable rockets like the seven 37 is

1224
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:04,980
that we have now that we turn around in
La and send back to New York and then

1225
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:09,981
turn around in New York and send back to
La for 35 to 40 years each.

1226
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,470
They amortize their costs.
They allow you to get a round trip

1227
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,500
ticket for as low as $220 on a really
good day.

1228
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:17,590
Um,
um,

1229
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:21,240
that's what's happening with space.
But where's the mining equipment going

1230
01:05:21,241 --> 01:05:23,950
to come from?
That's something NASA needs to be

1231
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:26,710
working on.
Plus the mining equipment for the moon

1232
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,710
to turn the moon basically into a fuel
station,

1233
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:31,570
a rock.
I'm just thinking about this while also

1234
01:05:31,571 --> 01:05:32,860
thinking about all the other things you
think are,

1235
01:05:32,861 --> 01:05:37,030
because I do my best thinking when I'm
thinking about 15 things at once and

1236
01:05:37,031 --> 01:05:40,450
that's why the music is there because my
mind is empty if I don't have,

1237
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,940
cause that's another threat going on at
the same time.

1238
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,490
I want to bring you back to something
you said earlier that you sort of

1239
01:05:45,491 --> 01:05:47,770
glossed over,
but you were talking about quantum

1240
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,050
physicists,
right?

1241
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:53,620
Getting everything wrong.
So I told him so I flew to Moscow.

1242
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,440
No,
and I've debunked that and a book called

1243
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:59,140
the God problem.
How I godless cosmos creates that has

1244
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:02,980
five heresies and Harrison.
Number one is that one,

1245
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:07,660
is that a a does not equal a,
that's aristotle's primary law of

1246
01:06:07,661 --> 01:06:08,530
identity.
No,

1247
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,870
it's not always true.
Um,

1248
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:15,560
one of the laws is the theory of entropy
is so fucking wrong that it justifies

1249
01:06:15,561 --> 01:06:19,090
the entering means that all everything
is falling apart constantly.

1250
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,580
And that in order to make something
positive happen,

1251
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:25,210
you have to shed more negative energy,
not really negative energy,

1252
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,580
more dispersed,
waste energy.

1253
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:30,340
And in fact,
the universe doesn't look work like

1254
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:33,220
that.
The universe in the very beginning at

1255
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:34,420
form,
quarks from,

1256
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:38,670
from nothing but motion quarks for
emotion.

1257
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:39,850
Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

1258
01:06:39,851 --> 01:06:43,660
The first things from movement,
are you joshing?

1259
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,150
No.
And then the quarks had to get together

1260
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:49,030
in groups of three because this is a
profoundly social universal,

1261
01:06:49,031 --> 01:06:49,960
they couldn't survive.

1262
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:54,910
And one form of Cork like this with one
up and two down or something like that

1263
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:57,940
is a neutron.
And the other direction,

1264
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:03,210
three quarks is a proton.
And all of this is anti entropic.

1265
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,300
And then what do all of these billiard
balls do?

1266
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:10,960
What are all these particles do?
[inaudible] hundred 80,000 years later,

1267
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:15,610
they begin sweet themselves together in
these massive social agglomerations that

1268
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:19,180
look like big potatoes.
And those are the beginnings of galaxies

1269
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,360
before they form their spiral arms and
stuff like that.

1270
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:25,060
Uh,
and then within the,

1271
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:30,210
the spiral arms of these galaxies.
Gravity balls are competing with each

1272
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:33,850
other to see who's the biggest gravity
ball and the biggest wins and what does

1273
01:07:33,851 --> 01:07:36,940
he do to the losers.
He swallows them and gets even bigger,

1274
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:40,600
which makes it possible for that gravity
ball to confront another bunch of

1275
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:43,510
gravity balls and beat them out for size
and swallow them.

1276
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:47,680
Eventually.
What happens is you get so much gravity

1277
01:07:47,890 --> 01:07:51,550
and so much matter in this gravity ball
that the gravity ball explodes.

1278
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:56,790
That's called a son a star and around it
are smaller gravity balls that managed

1279
01:07:57,581 --> 01:08:01,570
to hold their own in competitions and
their planets and moons.

1280
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:05,980
How the hell do you go?
Even this short distance into the life

1281
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:10,240
of galaxy that's been around for 13.7
billion years with precisely the

1282
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:13,330
opposite of entropy happening.
What is the official definition of

1283
01:08:13,331 --> 01:08:15,350
venture be?
How's it defined by Webster's

1284
01:08:15,351 --> 01:08:16,184
dictionary?

1285
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,620
Do you know?

1286
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,510
It's usually a weasel definition weasel.
Yeah.

1287
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:22,930
In other words,
it's deliberately obscure.

1288
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:25,160
Ah,
because it's such a weird subject.

1289
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:30,280
That's funny,
but every priesthood has a shibboleth.

1290
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,980
A shibboleth is a magic word.
If you can't pronounce it,

1291
01:08:32,981 --> 01:08:34,240
you're dead.
Ah,

1292
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:39,330
and so every tribe wants you to believe
in something that's impossible.

1293
01:08:40,031 --> 01:08:42,940
Remember the Red Queen or the White
Queen in Alice in Wonderland said,

1294
01:08:42,941 --> 01:08:46,150
sometimes I dream up six impossible
things before breakfast.

1295
01:08:46,151 --> 01:08:46,781
Yeah,
yeah,

1296
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:49,360
yeah.
And you have to pass the test by showing

1297
01:08:49,361 --> 01:08:52,810
that you believe in something that's
obviously fatuously wrong.

1298
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:57,070
And that's the the,
and the Shibboleth for being considered

1299
01:08:57,071 --> 01:09:02,071
a legitimate scientist is preaching
allegiance to pledging allegiance and

1300
01:09:03,011 --> 01:09:04,090
terpene.
Pull it up.

1301
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,280
Let me see what it says here.

1302
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:10,710
It says a measure of the unavailable
energy and a closed thermodynamic system

1303
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:16,630
that is also usually considered to be a
measure of the systems disorder.

1304
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:22,230
That is a property of the system state.
And that varies directly with any

1305
01:09:24,311 --> 01:09:29,311
reversible change in heat in the system
and inversely with the temperature of

1306
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:34,831
the system broadly,
the degree of disorder or uncertainty in

1307
01:09:35,411 --> 01:09:37,090
the system.
So that's what they're saying is the

1308
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:39,730
degree of disorder or uncertainty in the
system.

1309
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:43,080
Now,
obviously that's a very lucid

1310
01:09:43,081 --> 01:09:46,560
explanation and you could recite it to a
five year old and need to understand

1311
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:49,650
exactly what you were saying or to your
grandmother easily.

1312
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:53,070
It is a little reason.
It's very weasley.

1313
01:09:53,071 --> 01:09:56,490
It has lots of outs.
So my book,

1314
01:09:56,491 --> 01:09:59,250
the God problem,
how a godless cosmos creates debunks

1315
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:04,140
that along with a bunch of other
assumptions and current side is that

1316
01:10:04,141 --> 01:10:08,400
assumption exist?
He believes because in the 19th century

1317
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:13,550
when this was formulated,
the metaphor of the day was the steam

1318
01:10:13,831 --> 01:10:16,080
engine.
It was the hot new technology.

1319
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:20,070
It was to the the 19th century,
what computers are due the 22nd century

1320
01:10:20,071 --> 01:10:23,100
or whatever we're living in now,
the 21st century.

1321
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:24,820
Sorry.
And um,

1322
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:30,590
so what they realized was you take this
steam and you push it into a piston and

1323
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:37,380
it throws that piston up into the air
and then the piston comes back down

1324
01:10:37,381 --> 01:10:39,600
again,
but then there's waste.

1325
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:45,110
The steam then has lost its energy and
it comes out of an exhaust valve and you

1326
01:10:45,391 --> 01:10:47,220
put in more hot steam.
Right.

1327
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,470
Um,
so this was a theory about the waste

1328
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,840
that comes out of the steam engine.
But now that we don't have,

1329
01:10:57,841 --> 01:10:59,940
I mean cars,
yes they produce exhaust.

1330
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:04,980
Now would you say that um,
solar power and solar power does not

1331
01:11:04,981 --> 01:11:07,620
produce exhaust.
So where's the entropy?

1332
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:10,060
But where's the entropy?
Let's story of the universe.

1333
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:11,890
I was telling you aggregation of the
batteries

1334
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,800
cause I mean they are all

1335
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,160
listening by on whatever that could be,
but it's a,

1336
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,970
it's a square edge compared to the
construction of a sun.

1337
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,860
Right?
It's a squid compared to the

1338
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:27,540
construction of a galaxy and all that
random stuff in the universe.

1339
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,910
All those random particles,
first of all,

1340
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,880
they're not random.
They all participate in something.

1341
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:35,640
The universe rings like a Gong and its
early days.

1342
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,030
It has pressure waves.
That means that these elementary

1343
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:42,930
particles are sketching together and
forming a wave.

1344
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,370
Is that a technical term?
Yes.

1345
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:47,820
And,
and then they're squinching apart and

1346
01:11:47,821 --> 01:11:51,330
they're forming a trough and then there
scorching together again and that wave

1347
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:54,810
ripples across the cosmos.
The way that you see waves rippling

1348
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,790
across the Pacific when you're flying to
Hawaii.

1349
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:00,660
Um,
is that entropic,

1350
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:05,670
is that disorder constantly increasing?
Now it's the very opposite.

1351
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,660
What the universe does it,
it takes every form of waste and turns

1352
01:12:09,661 --> 01:12:10,770
it into an opportunity.

1353
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:12,060
It,
I mean,

1354
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,540
what we call this place earth,
what are we naming it for?

1355
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:21,080
The Excreta of warms the shit of worms
because they produced what we call soil.

1356
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,260
Well,
think of the meaning of that word.

1357
01:12:25,261 --> 01:12:27,150
Soil.
When something is soiled,

1358
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,010
what does it like?
It's not covered with earthy loam.

1359
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:35,430
It's dirty.
Um,

1360
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,520
so,
and we call it dirt when it's in the

1361
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:42,660
earth.
So we are taking this and tropic stuff,

1362
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:47,220
the shit that came out of worms and
we're farming in it and plants are

1363
01:12:47,221 --> 01:12:48,960
growing in it.
Trees are growing in it.

1364
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,450
Flowers are growing in it.
Is that entropy,

1365
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,660
is that a continual slide toward
disorder?

1366
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:58,860
It's the very opposite.
It's a continual slide toward order and

1367
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:03,390
higher degrees of form.
How is this theory been received?

1368
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:04,830
Um,
well,

1369
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,320
uh,
or your interpretation of it?

1370
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,930
That's a good question because,
um,

1371
01:13:10,230 --> 01:13:12,120
I really have no answer.

1372
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,540
Um,
the people who I sent the book to in the

1373
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,540
early days,
all of them except w well including a

1374
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:22,080
Nobel prize winner.
And I think three macarthur genius award

1375
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:27,081
winners all said this is a great book
and one compared it to Charles lyles

1376
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:33,410
history of the earth,
which gave Darwin a lot of ideas and to

1377
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:36,480
Darwin's origin of the species and
asked,

1378
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:38,820
is this really a great book?
Like those two books?

1379
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,420
And the answer has been yes.
And this is the Lucifer principle.

1380
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:43,800
Oh,
this is the God problem.

1381
01:13:43,801 --> 01:13:46,100
How He godless cosmos creates.
And,

1382
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:48,390
and let's not forget for the sake of the
audience,

1383
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:51,300
we're actually here to promote how I
accidentally started the 60s.

1384
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,850
The news is my newest book,
right?

1385
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,700
It's my sixth book,
six.

1386
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,210
But it was actually written during those
five years when I couldn't talk.

1387
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,243
Wow.
Um,

1388
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,660
the first draft was written during those
five years.

1389
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,030
So there I was laying in bed not able to
talk.

1390
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,710
And I know from all of my research that
when you are a human who feels of no

1391
01:14:10,711 --> 01:14:13,150
value to your fellow human beings,
you begin to die.

1392
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:17,980
Your immune system goes into under
underperformance and stops protecting

1393
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:22,120
you from diseases.
So I needed to somehow maintain a social

1394
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:25,780
set of connections despite the fact that
I couldn't talk in my own wife,

1395
01:14:25,781 --> 01:14:28,690
couldn't walk into the room and read a
newspaper with me.

1396
01:14:28,990 --> 01:14:31,600
So what did I do?
I figured,

1397
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:34,220
okay,
I'm most sick people churn,

1398
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,730
churn out what are called repulsion
cues.

1399
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:39,730
Cues that drive other people away.
They don't want to be near you when

1400
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:42,760
you're sick and suffering and we really
don't kind as they may be.

1401
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,910
Um,
so you have to put out attraction cues,

1402
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:50,911
the opposite of repulsion cues and
what's an a number one attraction queue.

1403
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:54,910
It's humor.
So there I was reading Dave Berry and

1404
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:59,530
reading PG woodhouse and these guys were
lifting me for an hour or two above my

1405
01:14:59,531 --> 01:15:01,930
misery,
giving me this transcendent humor that

1406
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:04,630
just took me out of my state at that
point.

1407
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,810
So I tried to write transcendent humor
and I wrote this story of how I

1408
01:15:09,911 --> 01:15:13,570
accidentally help form a movement on the
west coast that had no name.

1409
01:15:13,571 --> 01:15:17,230
And then I left the country and when I
got back the loose empire,

1410
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,230
the time life empire had given her the
name,

1411
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:23,550
they called it the hippie movement.
And I tried to write her does.

1412
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:24,850
Absolutely.
And it's funny,

1413
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:28,180
a manner as possible.
And then when I was finished writing it,

1414
01:15:28,181 --> 01:15:32,800
I wrote because I couldn't talk,
I wrote a letter in those days they had

1415
01:15:32,801 --> 01:15:35,890
to be snail mailed because most people
didn't have email back then.

1416
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:37,480
I did,
but most people didn't.

1417
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:42,670
And I snail mailed my friend Eric
Gardner because Eric Gardner had started

1418
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:47,380
out in the music business as a Roadie
for the Jefferson airplane.

1419
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:50,470
And I wrote Eric and said,
Eric,

1420
01:15:50,471 --> 01:15:52,810
I just written this book,
could you get it to the Jefferson

1421
01:15:52,811 --> 01:15:55,510
airplane?
Cause if I could get them to say

1422
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:57,310
something positive about that,
about it,

1423
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:02,080
that validated it cause they were a key
act in the 1960s and Eric said,

1424
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:02,621
no,
no,

1425
01:16:02,621 --> 01:16:05,500
no,
I have somebody better send me the

1426
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:07,720
manuscript.
So I sent him the manuscript and he got

1427
01:16:07,721 --> 01:16:10,960
the manuscript to this other client of
his and the other client came back with

1428
01:16:10,961 --> 01:16:12,910
a quote that said,
it's a monumental masterpiece of

1429
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:16,570
American literature and filled with,
while we want to have experiences and

1430
01:16:16,571 --> 01:16:21,070
nonstop waves of scientific comedy
routines and nonstop waves of hilarity

1431
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,440
and compared to does James Joyce and
said,

1432
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:26,560
wow woo and it and signed it.

1433
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:29,380
Timothy leary and I thought this can't
be for real.

1434
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:34,360
This just can't be for real.
But it was 1995 and what I didn't know,

1435
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:39,361
it took me 15 years to find out is that
Timothy leary got this book when he was

1436
01:16:40,331 --> 01:16:44,260
sick in bed like I was,
he was dying of prostate cancer.

1437
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:49,920
This book reached him six months before
he would die of prostate cancer and I

1438
01:16:49,931 --> 01:16:53,200
had written the book to be on a plane of
humor that would yank you out of your

1439
01:16:53,201 --> 01:16:57,370
body and Yank you up to an ethereal
plane of humor cause you were trying to

1440
01:16:57,371 --> 01:16:58,840
do that to yourself.
I needed to,

1441
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:02,260
since these two guys had done it for me,
I needed to do my best to do it for

1442
01:17:02,261 --> 01:17:05,050
others and to attract people to stick
with me.

1443
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,730
Cause I sent these things out,
his letters,

1444
01:17:06,731 --> 01:17:08,920
the chapters out,
his letters to friends,

1445
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,910
hoping a few friends would still stick
with me.

1446
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,880
And um,
when leary read it,

1447
01:17:13,890 --> 01:17:18,500
apparently it did for him.
What would house and Dave Barry had done

1448
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:22,940
for me.
And I was stunned when I found that out.

1449
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,700
Absolutely stoned.
So yes,

1450
01:17:25,701 --> 01:17:27,680
Virginia,
you can be in the worst of all possible

1451
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:32,681
circumstances and you can pull together
something from low circumstances as a

1452
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,040
gift,
your fellow humans.

1453
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:36,230
And yes,
you will doubt that it will ever be a

1454
01:17:36,231 --> 01:17:38,600
value to any human on the planet because
that's what,

1455
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,900
that's how us humans feel about most of
our endeavors.

1456
01:17:42,350 --> 01:17:44,570
Um,
bought some day.

1457
01:17:44,571 --> 01:17:48,980
It just may save somebody who's in a
position equivalent to yours.

1458
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,740
That's amazing.
That is amazing.

1459
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,910
What are the other things that the
quantum physicists got?

1460
01:17:55,911 --> 01:17:57,260
Ra?
Well.

1461
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,940
Um,
all of them.

1462
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:00,920
For four,
there was a four day conference,

1463
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,350
um,
in a pouncing own of just outside

1464
01:18:03,351 --> 01:18:05,480
Moscow,
50 miles outside of Moscow.

1465
01:18:05,780 --> 01:18:08,810
It was a worker's paradise built in the
1960s.

1466
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:10,610
And,
um,

1467
01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:13,940
and all the people there,
all the physicists were going around

1468
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:17,260
drawing the same diagram on Napkins to
explain what they were talking about.

1469
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:21,440
And it's a diagram of how short matures
equation manifest itself in one single

1470
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:23,810
isolated electron.
Well,

1471
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:24,644
guess what,
Jo,

1472
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:28,820
there's no such thing as an isolated
electron in this universe.

1473
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,870
There's no such thing as an,
uh,

1474
01:18:30,970 --> 01:18:35,970
an isolated Quanta of light.
And it's isolated photon of light.

1475
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:38,570
There's no such thing as an isolated
anything.

1476
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:40,700
I mean,
when you look up at the night sky,

1477
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:46,120
what do you see stars,
some of those stars are 13 billion light

1478
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:50,030
years away.
It's taken 13 billion years for that

1479
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:53,600
light to get to us.
But we can still see those lights with a

1480
01:18:53,601 --> 01:18:58,601
telescope is if there is light flooding
the entire universe from low stars,

1481
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,110
how could this be?
How could there ever be a particle

1482
01:19:03,111 --> 01:19:05,930
living on its own,
not awash in light,

1483
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:09,620
gravitational effects,
electromagnetic effects from all the

1484
01:19:09,621 --> 01:19:13,200
other things in the universe,
or at least a good many of them.

1485
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,680
So why is this,
was his misconception prevalent?

1486
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:17,330
Uh,
it because the,

1487
01:19:17,331 --> 01:19:20,240
the equation fit certain very
artificial,

1488
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:23,330
um,
experiments that were set up in the lab

1489
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:28,010
and once an experiment has done and
accepted than everybody who doesn't get

1490
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:30,830
the same results,
thinks he's doing it wrong and does it

1491
01:19:30,831 --> 01:19:35,660
over and over again till he gets the
same results and the explanation.

1492
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,410
For some reason,
a lot of people in this universe think

1493
01:19:39,411 --> 01:19:40,550
we're on our own.
No,

1494
01:19:40,551 --> 01:19:43,370
we're never on our own.
We're always under the influence of

1495
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:45,890
other human beings.
And look at the SARS.

1496
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,040
Only the light is reaching us.
They're not determining,

1497
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,420
uh,
whether you're rural friends going to

1498
01:19:50,421 --> 01:19:52,550
argue with you tomorrow,
like your horoscope says.

1499
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:55,520
But there's that influence of merely
being able to see them.

1500
01:19:55,850 --> 01:20:00,110
So I was basically lecturing these guys
about a social cosmos in which

1501
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:03,290
conversation,
information exchange is constantly

1502
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:04,970
taking place all over the place.

1503
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,560
And the,
and the fact that troubleshoots shirts

1504
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:12,561
equation assumes an isolated entity and
there are no isolated entities,

1505
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,000
these in this universe.
And when I was finished,

1506
01:20:15,001 --> 01:20:17,280
I expected them to throw me out of their
conference.

1507
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:24,140
And instead they sat there as if this
had been my bar Mitzvah and I just done

1508
01:20:24,151 --> 01:20:26,850
a half tour or whatever it's called,
that you do what a bar Mitzvah.

1509
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,940
And they were my uncles,
they were all sitting back,

1510
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:32,400
their faces were beaming,
they were smiling,

1511
01:20:32,401 --> 01:20:33,600
you know,
that radiance,

1512
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:37,560
that redness that infects a faceless,
excited about something.

1513
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:40,950
It was astonishing and I couldn't
understand why.

1514
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:44,640
And then three years later,
I have a collaborator in theoretical

1515
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:46,630
physics,
Potlicker rock of the Kelly [inaudible]

1516
01:20:46,631 --> 01:20:49,680
suit of applied mathematics of the
Russian Academy of Sciences.

1517
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:53,820
And Pavel emailed me and said,
doctor [inaudible] go off the man who

1518
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:56,640
ran that conference,
the man who gave you such a hard time

1519
01:20:56,641 --> 01:20:58,650
about your credit card,
um,

1520
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:59,790
he's just written a book.

1521
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,560
You have to download it from arcserve
org,

1522
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:05,220
which is the leading site for preprints
and advanced mathematics and advanced

1523
01:21:05,221 --> 01:21:08,730
theoretical physics in the world.
And so I downloaded it,

1524
01:21:08,731 --> 01:21:12,240
put it on my kindle and listened to the
first half while I was taking my

1525
01:21:12,241 --> 01:21:15,480
afternoon walk.
These long walks through the park can be

1526
01:21:15,481 --> 01:21:18,780
very helpful.
And when I got to the cafe where I was

1527
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:21,780
working in those days and got my laptop
in front of me,

1528
01:21:21,781 --> 01:21:24,300
I wrote to doctor Rouger cough and I
said,

1529
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,400
doctor Chekhov,
I don't know if you remember me,

1530
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:28,560
I'm not crazy American who spoke at your
conference,

1531
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:31,710
but I've just read the first half of
your book and it's phenomenal.

1532
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:35,460
He used every concept that I had given
in my presentation,

1533
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:38,820
every concept.
And I got one of those almost instant

1534
01:21:38,821 --> 01:21:42,750
emails back and email.
It comes within two or three hours and

1535
01:21:42,751 --> 01:21:44,730
who should go have said,
remember you,

1536
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,820
didn't you read the first half of my
book?

1537
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,600
And we are accredited in there.
My partner,

1538
01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:53,070
uh,
pavel and I,

1539
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:58,550
so to at least a bunch of quantum
physicists from 11 times zones gathering

1540
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:00,810
in Moscow.
Um,

1541
01:22:00,930 --> 01:22:03,630
what I was saying made sense quantum
physics.

1542
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:05,580
Does it make sense to me?
Well,

1543
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:06,690
I've tried.
Yeah,

1544
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:08,900
I tried really hard.
It makes about the same senses.

1545
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:10,940
That definition you were just reading
event trippy.

1546
01:22:10,950 --> 01:22:13,140
Exactly.
I'll go over it and over it again and

1547
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:18,141
get little chunks of it and that would
understand like sections of sentences.

1548
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:19,890
Right,
and then I'd have to try to put them

1549
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:21,810
together with the other sections.
It's hard.

1550
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,930
It's tough stuff,
but one of the most important things,

1551
01:22:24,931 --> 01:22:27,540
I think it was Neil's war who said this,
I'm not quite sure,

1552
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:32,370
but one of the members of the Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum physics said

1553
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:37,490
that basically a particle exists in many
states simultaneously and it's not until

1554
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:39,840
it's measured that a collapses into one
stage.

1555
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,970
That's one of the basic principles of
quantum physics.

1556
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:43,530
Well,
guess what,

1557
01:22:43,531 --> 01:22:46,710
Niels,
every particle is being measured in some

1558
01:22:46,711 --> 01:22:51,120
way all the time,
all of its life by other particles that

1559
01:22:51,121 --> 01:22:53,610
are basically taking its measure and
then responding.

1560
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:56,400
Essentially.
Nothing is isolated.

1561
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:59,100
Nothing is isolated in this particular
cosmos.

1562
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:01,920
You were talking,
I watched a video where you were talking

1563
01:23:01,921 --> 01:23:05,280
about that there is essentially a
universal brain.

1564
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,190
Well,

1565
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,550
yes,
because you and I right now we're going

1566
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:13,420
to be talking to possibly out of your
500 words,

1567
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:16,780
it's more like 1 million,
uh,

1568
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:19,960
total viewers and listeners.
I'm more than that.

1569
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:22,180
So it's probably closer to three.
Yeah.

1570
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:26,500
So we're going to be talking to let's
say 100,000 of them or 200,000 of them.

1571
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:29,770
Um,
and they're processing what we are

1572
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:34,000
saying right now there are bacteria and
your gut and mine who live in enormous

1573
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:36,100
colonies.
And An orb is bacterial colony.

1574
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:38,740
If you had it on the palm of your hand,
it would be the size of your hand,

1575
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:41,560
but you couldn't see it.
Are you thinking of this while you're

1576
01:23:41,561 --> 01:23:43,690
saying it,
are you thinking of that vast numbers of

1577
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:47,860
people that are listening and watching
or are you just relaying the

1578
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:48,980
information?
Like are you

1579
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:51,980
cognizant?
Yup,

1580
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,080
both.
Both.

1581
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:55,930
Because I want,
remember Einstein gave me my marching

1582
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:56,440
orders.

1583
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,060
You have to take complex ideas and
simplify them so much that anyone with a

1584
01:24:01,061 --> 01:24:04,420
high school education and a reasonable
degree of on intelligence can understand

1585
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:06,490
them.
And I want to make good radio for your

1586
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:07,740
audience.
But once you,

1587
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:11,200
what I'm trying to get at is once you
have got an established in your head

1588
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:14,380
that nothing is isolated,
that everything is connected.

1589
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:17,920
When you speak,
are you aware when you're speaking that

1590
01:24:17,921 --> 01:24:19,390
everything is connected?
I mean,

1591
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:24,040
are you,
are you actually consciously thinking of

1592
01:24:24,041 --> 01:24:27,970
all of these different minds taking into
account all these different mind blowing

1593
01:24:27,971 --> 01:24:31,240
things that you're saying and then
applying them out in the world?

1594
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,370
I think so.
Yeah.

1595
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,240
I mean,
you know,

1596
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:37,210
if you hear it coming out of my,
well that's what's churning around in my

1597
01:24:37,211 --> 01:24:37,961
brain.
I'm just,

1598
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:39,760
you're,
you're such a bright guy.

1599
01:24:39,761 --> 01:24:43,600
I'm just trying to understand if you're
in the moment or if you're in the

1600
01:24:43,601 --> 01:24:46,600
moment,
as well as being consciously aware of

1601
01:24:46,601 --> 01:24:48,550
the spread of information.

1602
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:51,150
My obligation is to do both
simultaneously,

1603
01:24:51,151 --> 01:24:53,320
simultaneous.
That's my obligation.

1604
01:24:53,321 --> 01:24:54,540
That's what I assumed.
Yeah.

1605
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,190
So at any rate,
so the,

1606
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:01,060
the entropic theory doesn't make any
sense.

1607
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,440
The,
I mean,

1608
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,640
look,
there,

1609
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:04,780
I was in a bed,
right?

1610
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:06,730
Right.
So you would think I'm totally isolated

1611
01:25:06,731 --> 01:25:07,990
and I'm not,
you're not.

1612
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,040
I'm not.
I mean,

1613
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:11,530
once upon a time I wrote an essay about
descartes.

1614
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,780
Well,
descartes came up with the idea of,

1615
01:25:13,781 --> 01:25:16,220
I think therefore I am.
Um,

1616
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:21,270
he took a retreat in Amsterdam.
He rented a second floor apartment and

1617
01:25:22,181 --> 01:25:25,970
he was trying to isolate himself the way
that those particles are isolated with

1618
01:25:25,971 --> 01:25:28,450
the short mushers equation,
the particles that were being drawn on

1619
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:30,610
Napkins in Moscow.
Um,

1620
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:35,440
and so that he could strip everything
away and find out what were the most

1621
01:25:35,441 --> 01:25:40,420
basic thing and the most basic axiom,
the most basic thing we take for granted

1622
01:25:40,421 --> 01:25:42,460
in life.
And he came up with,

1623
01:25:42,461 --> 01:25:45,670
I think therefore I am now.
Think about this for a minute.

1624
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:51,780
While he was trying to think this out,
he was needing a rubbery gum eraser with

1625
01:25:52,991 --> 01:25:55,990
which he erased is inc he was sitting on
the second floor,

1626
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:59,170
which means somebody had invented the
architecture that he was sitting in and

1627
01:25:59,171 --> 01:26:03,380
the concept of the floor and the concept
of beams that go across from one wall to

1628
01:26:03,381 --> 01:26:04,160
the other

1629
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,010
that were holding him up.
He was looking out the window and he was

1630
01:26:07,011 --> 01:26:11,120
looking at the hats that the Amsterdam
men and women were wearing as they

1631
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:15,410
walked by and he was fucking in the
cleaning lady whom he made pregnant.

1632
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:17,790
So how isolated really was he

1633
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:23,650
the universal mind theory this or this
concept?

1634
01:26:23,651 --> 01:26:25,430
It shouldn't say theory.
Um,

1635
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,250
w the way you were describing it,
it's very interesting that there is no

1636
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:33,070
individual thought that essentially
there's,

1637
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:36,040
there's lots of individual thought.
It's all connected,

1638
01:26:36,041 --> 01:26:38,920
right?
To all the other people that are around

1639
01:26:38,921 --> 01:26:41,230
you and all the people that you've
interacted with and all the places

1640
01:26:41,231 --> 01:26:44,740
you've been and the things you've seen
and all the people that are constantly

1641
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,170
thinking simultaneously around you that
you're aware of

1642
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,640
and the people that you're trying to
influence because you're trying to

1643
01:26:49,641 --> 01:26:51,430
influence people all day long.
Right?

1644
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,600
Um,
if you want somebody to bring you a

1645
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:55,880
sandwich,
you have to get across that.

1646
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:59,540
You want that sandwich.
And especially if you want somebody like

1647
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:02,570
a wife or an assistant to bring you a
sandwich and that's not normally what

1648
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:04,970
they do,
then you really have to work hard and

1649
01:27:04,971 --> 01:27:05,804
influence going.
But,

1650
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:11,050
but the the universe,
at least the living part of the universe

1651
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:13,610
and so far we only know of life on this
planet.

1652
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:16,760
It's all interconnected.
Those bacteria I was talking about there

1653
01:27:16,761 --> 01:27:19,250
in your gut,
they are making your vitamin B.

1654
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,220
They are making your vitamin K,
they are making an awful lot of the

1655
01:27:22,221 --> 01:27:25,490
things that you use to survive.
They're also making chemicals that

1656
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:29,090
influence your mind and your moods.
They're manipulating you.

1657
01:27:29,480 --> 01:27:34,480
So when you go down to the corner store
to buy some chocolate,

1658
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:37,490
a claire's and you go home and you eat
them.

1659
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:39,770
In fact,
you can only digest a small portion of

1660
01:27:39,771 --> 01:27:40,730
the chocolate,
a claire,

1661
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:43,070
those bacterial colonies living in your
gut.

1662
01:27:43,430 --> 01:27:45,380
They do the rest of that I adjusting for
you.

1663
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:49,040
So who's really going to the corner
store?

1664
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:53,420
Who's really the boss who's really
driving you the vehicle of

1665
01:27:53,421 --> 01:27:56,690
transportation?
Are these bacteria driving you down to

1666
01:27:56,691 --> 01:28:00,200
the corner store so that you will feed
them the stuff that they love the most

1667
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:03,410
or ours your will driving you to the
corner store?

1668
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,730
While the answer's a little of both,
a little of both.

1669
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:10,660
Not as much of both.
I mean there,

1670
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:15,700
there's this example of
there's this fungus and the fungus has a

1671
01:28:16,851 --> 01:28:20,570
very peculiar lifestyle and I'm very
curious to find out how it got this

1672
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:23,630
lifestyle.
But it lives half of its life in an ant

1673
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:28,631
colony and half of its life and a sheep.
So when it comes out of the phase of

1674
01:28:30,170 --> 01:28:32,060
that,
it goes through in the ant colony and is

1675
01:28:32,061 --> 01:28:37,061
ready to go into the sheep,
it takes over the brain of an ant and it

1676
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:41,990
gets that ant to climb to the top of a
stalk of grass.

1677
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:44,540
Why?
Because when the sheep come along to

1678
01:28:44,541 --> 01:28:46,670
graze,
they will inhale the ant.

1679
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:52,840
What you're telling me that a fungus can
control the mind of an ant and ways that

1680
01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:59,111
we're just beginning to explore now this
year and maybe last year a tiny little

1681
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:03,270
bit,
that it can actually be that precise in

1682
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:06,480
how it takes over the controls of that
to one of those,

1683
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:08,610
uh,
the fungus that gets inside those ants

1684
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:12,030
and the ants are aware of it.
So they take the ant away because the

1685
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:15,600
aunt will explode and spray spores into
the air and it will affect the,

1686
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:19,170
in fact I'm not aware of that one,
but it sounds cordyceps.

1687
01:29:19,830 --> 01:29:23,370
Yeah,
but it sounds similar but the real deal

1688
01:29:23,371 --> 01:29:24,570
is,
okay,

1689
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,710
life on this earth functions the way
that a beehive functions and how does it

1690
01:29:28,711 --> 01:29:33,711
be high functioning?
95% of the bees are conformist peas and

1691
01:29:34,831 --> 01:29:39,690
they out go out to the hot flower patch
of the day and they mine the nectar and

1692
01:29:39,691 --> 01:29:42,450
they have a public stomach in which they
can carry this stuff.

1693
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,340
I mean built into them inside of them
and they have these carrying Harris on

1694
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:51,510
their thighs and they carry pollen in
those and when they arrive at the

1695
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:55,320
unloading bay,
there is an unloading bay and the hive

1696
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:57,510
and when they arrive at the unloading
bay,

1697
01:29:57,511 --> 01:30:01,620
if the unloaders no,
that the interior really needs pollen

1698
01:30:01,621 --> 01:30:05,490
and nectar and they see you carrying
that pollen and nectar,

1699
01:30:05,491 --> 01:30:08,430
they stick their tongues down your
throat to check out what's in your

1700
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:10,740
public stomach.
They go wild with excitement.

1701
01:30:10,770 --> 01:30:12,480
When they discover it's filled with
nectar,

1702
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:16,140
they check out your thighs,
the caring hairs on your thighs.

1703
01:30:16,380 --> 01:30:19,500
They go wild.
When they see that you're carrying pond,

1704
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:21,630
they feel you all over with their
antenna.

1705
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:25,920
They are intensely excited when they are
unloading you and that gets you excited.

1706
01:30:25,921 --> 01:30:29,720
You feel like a rockstar because this is
the same kind of attention a rockstar

1707
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:30,623
gets.

1708
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:34,410
So you go back out to the flower patch
of the day and mine some more.

1709
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,700
Meanwhile,
there are these lazy good for nothing.

1710
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:42,150
Bohemian bees,
there are anywhere from 5% to 20% of the

1711
01:30:42,151 --> 01:30:46,860
colony and they don't do a single useful
thing at all.

1712
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,620
And so far as you can see,
they don't do anything to earn their

1713
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:51,360
keep in the colony.
Why?

1714
01:30:51,570 --> 01:30:56,570
Because they're out doing loop after
loop after loop and lazy eights after

1715
01:30:57,390 --> 01:30:58,880
lazy aids,
after lazy aids,

1716
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,560
they'll fly eight miles just following
their whims,

1717
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:04,620
following their whims.
I mean if you were their mother,

1718
01:31:04,621 --> 01:31:08,050
what would you say?
You're wasting your fucking life for God

1719
01:31:08,051 --> 01:31:09,000
sakes.
Okay?

1720
01:31:09,150 --> 01:31:14,130
Eventually you the conformance be star
coming back without pollen and you're

1721
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:18,360
carrying Harris and without nectar and
your public stomach because the flower

1722
01:31:18,361 --> 01:31:20,340
patch,
that flower patches of the day has been

1723
01:31:20,341 --> 01:31:24,060
thoroughly plundered.
And when you arrive at the unloading

1724
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:27,920
dock of the hive,
the unloading be stick their tongue into

1725
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:29,730
your public stomach empty,
sorry.

1726
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,740
They see are carrying Harris empty.
They turn their backs on you so savagely

1727
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,070
that you feel as if you've been cut dead
and it finally,

1728
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:41,730
I mean you can't believe that the old
factories not delivering anymore and

1729
01:31:41,731 --> 01:31:44,880
it's not giving you a paycheck.
So you keep going back to the same patch

1730
01:31:44,881 --> 01:31:48,870
over and over again more slowly each
time until finally you give up and you

1731
01:31:48,871 --> 01:31:53,430
literally crawl into the hive.
And Thomas Sealy,

1732
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:56,850
the guy who's done most of the research
on this,

1733
01:31:57,390 --> 01:32:01,790
calls you on unemployed b and you are as
depressed as if you were an employee.

1734
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:03,880
How do we know that?
Because your body temperature is down

1735
01:32:03,881 --> 01:32:08,881
and you're crawling instead of walking
and you're begging for food from other

1736
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:10,600
bees.
Well,

1737
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:13,660
you look for something to perk you up.
Now,

1738
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:18,661
what do humans use a football game?
A movie bees use pretty much the same

1739
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:19,690
thing.

1740
01:32:19,690 --> 01:32:23,350
What does that mean?
They go to the unloading dock out of the

1741
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:27,070
200 lazy good for nothing.
Bohemian be simply following their

1742
01:32:27,071 --> 01:32:31,330
instincts.
Five have come back having found new

1743
01:32:31,331 --> 01:32:36,331
flower patches and they are dancing and
the dancing excites you and they're

1744
01:32:36,821 --> 01:32:40,690
dancing in competition with each other.
Some will dance 27 seconds,

1745
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,100
some will dance 27 minutes.
And if you find the dance of one of

1746
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:49,270
those dancers sufficiently persuasive,
it lifts you out of your lethargy,

1747
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:54,220
gets you excited and you fly out.
She's giving a little in a little figure

1748
01:32:54,221 --> 01:32:57,010
eight dance.
She is giving precise instructions on

1749
01:32:57,011 --> 01:32:59,990
how to get to the flower patch and what
the headwinds are and what the tail

1750
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:03,160
winds are.
And you pick up her message,

1751
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,700
you fly out to the flower patch to that
she has recommended and you check it out

1752
01:33:06,701 --> 01:33:09,670
for yourself.
And if you get excited about it,

1753
01:33:09,671 --> 01:33:11,560
you come back and you start dancing.

1754
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:16,570
And ultimately the be who gets the
greatest number of backup dancers wins

1755
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,540
and you all go out,
all you can form us.

1756
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:23,740
Bees were now unemployed.
Go out to the new hot flower patch of

1757
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:25,690
the day in the same pattern repeats
itself.

1758
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:30,610
Now that's a collective mind operating
on the basis of 20,000 independent bees

1759
01:33:31,090 --> 01:33:36,090
and the the living world operates and
pretty much the same way bacteria are

1760
01:33:38,171 --> 01:33:43,171
using you to get them chocolate eclairs.
You are using them to digest chocolate,

1761
01:33:43,691 --> 01:33:47,620
a eclairs.
They are teasing our scientists and to

1762
01:33:47,621 --> 01:33:51,670
wild activity by threatening to develop
illnesses that can bypass all of our

1763
01:33:51,671 --> 01:33:55,030
antibiotics,
which by the way are chemical weapons

1764
01:33:55,330 --> 01:33:58,240
that microorganisms,
colonies of microorganisms,

1765
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,720
organisms use to kill entire competing
colonies.

1766
01:34:02,230 --> 01:34:05,650
We stole him from microorganisms,
so we didn't admit them antibiotics.

1767
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:09,770
So the scientists are very worth fact
that the bees are,

1768
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:14,020
that the bacteria are getting ahead of
us in research and development and are

1769
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:16,960
beginning to develop techniques to get
around all of our drugs.

1770
01:34:17,230 --> 01:34:22,230
So they are researching their ass off.
So is there any common brain that links

1771
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:25,990
the bacteria to the scientific
community?

1772
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:29,650
You bet they're competing with each
other and in the process of competing

1773
01:34:29,651 --> 01:34:31,120
with each other,
what are they doing?

1774
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:34,330
They are both creating new options for
all of life.

1775
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:40,580
Wow.
So when we're talking about antibiotics,

1776
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:42,680
penicillin or amoxicillin and stuff like
that,

1777
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:45,440
these are bacteria created

1778
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,190
Korean boys,
bacteria make war with each other.

1779
01:34:49,191 --> 01:34:51,590
When people tell you we are the only
creatures that make war,

1780
01:34:51,591 --> 01:34:52,424
they're allying.

1781
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:56,660
So is this why also when,
especially if you're experimenting with

1782
01:34:56,661 --> 01:34:58,280
your,
um,

1783
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:01,490
people that have a,
a very sugar based diet,

1784
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,520
they have a high number of certain kinds
of bacteria in their stomach that craves

1785
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:10,130
that kind of sugar and it makes it very
difficult to get off that,

1786
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:11,473
that kind of a diet.

1787
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:12,460
Well,
that's interesting.

1788
01:35:12,461 --> 01:35:13,660
I mean,
I'm not aware of that,

1789
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:16,990
but it sounds,
it sounds logical given gut bacteria

1790
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:18,130
about the biome.

1791
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:19,281
Yeah.
Yeah.

1792
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:20,690
When you find out,
uh,

1793
01:35:20,930 --> 01:35:23,240
one of the things,
if you try to alter your diet,

1794
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,800
if you're in a very high refined
carbohydrate diet and you try to get off

1795
01:35:27,801 --> 01:35:28,300
of that,
the,

1796
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:32,780
you have intense cravings,
but those eventually go away.

1797
01:35:32,781 --> 01:35:36,560
Especially when you supplement with a
lot of probiotics and then you'd go to a

1798
01:35:36,561 --> 01:35:38,990
high fat,
low carbohydrate diet,

1799
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:43,100
you start to crave those kinds of foods
and the cravings for sugar and bread go

1800
01:35:43,101 --> 01:35:44,270
away.
It's very strange.

1801
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:45,850
Well,
that's interesting because I am on a

1802
01:35:45,851 --> 01:35:50,851
very restricted diet myself.
I developed it myself.

1803
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,470
It's take,
it took 30 years down.

1804
01:35:54,580 --> 01:35:58,090
It's a diet that maximizes my energy and
my ability to concentrate.

1805
01:35:58,270 --> 01:35:59,850
What's a tangle meal?
Uh,

1806
01:35:59,890 --> 01:36:01,540
there are only two meals.
Um,

1807
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:06,850
breakfast is a can of tuna fish and
avocado and mango.

1808
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:12,220
Um,
that's at 10 30 in the morning,

1809
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:14,020
um,
dinner,

1810
01:36:14,021 --> 01:36:16,840
which is at three o'clock or two 30 in
the morning,

1811
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:18,850
two 30 in the morning.
Yeah.

1812
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:22,780
Remember I'm an odd schedule that I'm
primarily nocturnal because of my

1813
01:36:22,781 --> 01:36:23,614
illness,
right?

1814
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:28,030
So dinner is a half a pound of ground
chicken,

1815
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:31,630
a pound of frozen vegetables and apple,
an orange and a banana.

1816
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:34,810
Why frozen vegetables?
Because you can get them in one pound

1817
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:37,780
bags,
so it's precisely premeasured for you.

1818
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:40,660
Um,
and they freeze them when they're fresh

1819
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:44,770
and you can throw them along with a slab
of,

1820
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,240
um,
chopped chicken.

1821
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,280
Um,
frozen slab,

1822
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:50,980
uh,
into a microwaveable container and

1823
01:36:50,981 --> 01:36:52,960
microwave them for 15 minutes.
I mean,

1824
01:36:52,961 --> 01:36:55,510
throw a lot of spices in so that you
change the flavor,

1825
01:36:55,930 --> 01:37:00,930
but a day after day and you've got
dinner and that's all you ever eat.

1826
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:03,200
That's all I ever had except,
uh,

1827
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:08,210
on Friday I allow myself to eat sauces
and cheese sauces out of a jar because I

1828
01:37:08,891 --> 01:37:13,180
don't eat things that have artificial
ingredients or additives of any kind

1829
01:37:13,390 --> 01:37:17,740
normally.
And so I have this wanking huge meal and

1830
01:37:17,741 --> 01:37:21,430
then on Saturday alr and myself to
splurge on absolutely anything I want to

1831
01:37:21,431 --> 01:37:22,810
eat.
So that's your cheat day?

1832
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,760
Yeah.
What do you find yourself going to on a

1833
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:25,810
cheat day?
Well,

1834
01:37:25,811 --> 01:37:29,680
these days I've sort of settled into a
pattern and I take one frozen bag,

1835
01:37:29,681 --> 01:37:32,440
all a big one out of the refrigerator.
I slice it in half.

1836
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:36,460
I put huge amounts of peanut butter on
one hand when he first,

1837
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:40,870
I use a quarter of a pound of butter and
I slather on the two halves of the

1838
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:41,710
Bagel.

1839
01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:43,270
Uh,
cause I'm not allowed to eat any of

1840
01:37:43,271 --> 01:37:45,310
these things.
Bread not allowed to eat butter?

1841
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,840
No.
Why is that?

1842
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:51,640
Well we're told that butter is bad for
us and it and dairy turned out to be a

1843
01:37:51,641 --> 01:37:55,500
problem for me and I had a workout,
I had to work away around my food

1844
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:58,170
allergies and this is the Diet
[inaudible] allergy to dairy.

1845
01:37:58,620 --> 01:38:03,000
I apparently did.
I'm not sure I still do but so these

1846
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:07,860
huge honking amounts of butter and then
I take these giant slabs of peanut

1847
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:12,861
butter and I pile them up with a leaving
a little hole in the center and in the

1848
01:38:13,531 --> 01:38:17,880
hole in the center I put grape jam and
strawberry jam and then I take out the

1849
01:38:17,881 --> 01:38:22,881
marshmallow fluff and I put on almost an
entire jar of marshmallow fluff on top

1850
01:38:23,011 --> 01:38:25,850
of this one,
half a bangle cause I really want to

1851
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:31,140
taste the bagel naked with just butter
on it because I haven't had bread all

1852
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:36,140
week and it can taste really good and I
am indulging myself with this other half

1853
01:38:37,531 --> 01:38:39,720
of the Bagel.
How bad do you feel after you digest

1854
01:38:39,721 --> 01:38:40,740
that?
I don't feel bad.

1855
01:38:40,741 --> 01:38:45,741
I said,
I eat before I go to sleep and well,

1856
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:48,600
eating puts you to sleep.
Why should you have to slog through the

1857
01:38:48,601 --> 01:38:52,550
gray goo of your after meal experience
with,

1858
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:53,880
with your friends?
I mean,

1859
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:55,380
I,
if I'm with a friend,

1860
01:38:55,381 --> 01:38:58,160
I want to be at my maximum.
Um,

1861
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:02,250
I want to enjoy then how do I enjoy
myself with my mouth open and my tongue

1862
01:39:02,251 --> 01:39:03,084
going?
Right.

1863
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:07,560
So even having food in your mouth,
it's just preventing you from having a

1864
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:08,394
good coffee.

1865
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,620
Wow.
That's a fascinating way to approach it.

1866
01:39:12,621 --> 01:39:15,170
So you just will also,
if you carb up like that,

1867
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:17,060
you know,
with all that sugar and carbs,

1868
01:39:17,061 --> 01:39:19,310
you're going to want to crash in about
40 minutes after you,

1869
01:39:19,630 --> 01:39:21,310
and that turns out to be the case
anyway.

1870
01:39:21,311 --> 01:39:24,760
So I sleep immediately after my
breakfast and then I sleep immediately

1871
01:39:24,761 --> 01:39:26,920
after my dinner.
And that's the way the day is a range.

1872
01:39:26,921 --> 01:39:30,850
It's a range to maximize the useful high
energy,

1873
01:39:30,851 --> 01:39:32,680
high focus time.

1874
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,820
Now did they ever try to put you on any
kind of unfettered means or anything?

1875
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,130
Um,
no,

1876
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:38,750
not really.
Um,

1877
01:39:38,840 --> 01:39:40,580
and,
and my experience,

1878
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:42,590
you know,
I helped start the 60s.

1879
01:39:42,591 --> 01:39:44,020
So,
um,

1880
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:48,530
I helped start the drug culture and that
meant I did amphetamine twice.

1881
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,490
It was brand new back then and whatever
form it was popular

1882
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:56,040
provigil or Nuvigil.
I have a friend who has chronic fatigue

1883
01:39:56,041 --> 01:39:57,030
and that's where they put him on.

1884
01:39:57,080 --> 01:39:58,700
Well,
the stuff,

1885
01:39:58,701 --> 01:40:01,670
I'm on work so well,
I don't want to mess with it at this

1886
01:40:01,671 --> 01:40:03,410
point.
I'm lucky to be out of that bad.

1887
01:40:03,411 --> 01:40:04,490
I thought I would.
I Joe,

1888
01:40:04,491 --> 01:40:07,130
I thought I would never be out of that
bedroom again in my life.

1889
01:40:07,460 --> 01:40:09,150
And you've been out of the bed for 15
years.

1890
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:11,180
Yeah.
That's 15 years.

1891
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:11,960
That's amazing.
Right?

1892
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:14,620
So I'm giving three speeches this week
at the

1893
01:40:14,930 --> 01:40:16,640
18 and 15 out.
Yeah.

1894
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:17,640
Right.
Yup.

1895
01:40:18,390 --> 01:40:19,400
So,
um,

1896
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:22,450
you have so much energy.
It's hard to imagine you being

1897
01:40:22,451 --> 01:40:23,410
bedridden.
I mean,

1898
01:40:23,411 --> 01:40:24,660
it really is your,
your,

1899
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:29,320
I couldn't form a single syllable.
I mean,

1900
01:40:29,321 --> 01:40:30,440
I believe you.
Yeah,

1901
01:40:30,490 --> 01:40:32,220
I do believe you,
but I'm just saying it.

1902
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:34,660
Seeing you in this state,
you're smiling,

1903
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:35,494
you're,
you're,

1904
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:39,520
and obviously what you said about
enjoying conversations and it's so

1905
01:40:39,521 --> 01:40:42,880
parent.
He really enjoy getting these ideas

1906
01:40:42,881 --> 01:40:43,360
across.
Well,

1907
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:43,860
this is

1908
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:44,671
tremendous.
I mean,

1909
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:46,680
I,
I'm still dealing with how to get across

1910
01:40:46,681 --> 01:40:50,400
the idea of a global brain,
but it's basically every creature on the

1911
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:52,560
face of the earth.
This in some way contributing to our

1912
01:40:52,561 --> 01:40:54,970
knowledge base and our hunter gatherer
days.

1913
01:40:55,330 --> 01:40:58,240
If we were going to bring down a d or an
eat it for dinner,

1914
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:00,670
we had to get to know the mentality of
that deer.

1915
01:41:00,671 --> 01:41:04,060
We had to be able to shape it in our own
minds so we can anticipate its

1916
01:41:04,061 --> 01:41:06,880
movements.
So we anticipated the movements of

1917
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:09,250
lions.
We anticipated the movements of eagles.

1918
01:41:09,251 --> 01:41:14,251
We turned lions and Eagles and bears and
to totems and named ourselves after them

1919
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,860
because we were trying to learn from
their very spirit.

1920
01:41:17,861 --> 01:41:22,240
We were trying to learn muscularly and
emotionally how to be them so that we

1921
01:41:22,241 --> 01:41:24,670
could defeat them.
When the time came.

1922
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:27,370
There's a connection there.

1923
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:29,500
There's a global brain taking place
right there,

1924
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:33,880
and the deer and the block and the Bison
and the other creatures we were hunting.

1925
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:37,300
Even the wooly mammoths could not have
lived without those bacteria in their

1926
01:41:37,301 --> 01:41:38,500
guts.
Now,

1927
01:41:38,501 --> 01:41:42,700
we didn't discover those bacteria and
tell Anton van Leeuwenhoek dare to take

1928
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:46,420
his lens and instead of having it
horizontal to measure fabrics or we're

1929
01:41:46,421 --> 01:41:49,240
looking at fabrics,
started looking down at his own sperm,

1930
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:50,380
which was a very,
I mean,

1931
01:41:50,381 --> 01:41:53,200
look at what this guy did.
He's a tradesman.

1932
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:56,200
He's not a trained scientist.
Of course,

1933
01:41:56,201 --> 01:42:01,201
the word scientist didn't exist until
eight roughly 1850 but nonetheless,

1934
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:07,020
he is taking his observations of fresh
human sperm through his newly invented

1935
01:42:07,361 --> 01:42:09,640
microscope and he's sending the
observations.

1936
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:13,270
He's discovered that there are
animalcules little animals,

1937
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:17,770
totally independent,
flailing around in this farm and he

1938
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:20,560
writes a lengthy letter about this to
the royal society.

1939
01:42:20,980 --> 01:42:23,650
Now what has he just John Joe to the
Royal Society.

1940
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:26,950
He's confessed to masturbation.
Oh my God.

1941
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:28,900
Where do you think he got the sperm?
I mean,

1942
01:42:28,901 --> 01:42:30,910
it took me about 40 years of thinking
about,

1943
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:35,230
it may be 50 to work it out and then I
suddenly realized this guy is,

1944
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,330
why does masturbation keep showing up in
my life?

1945
01:42:37,331 --> 01:42:39,790
One look,
the boy scouts threw me out when I was

1946
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:41,890
11 years old for incompetence at Morse
code.

1947
01:42:42,070 --> 01:42:44,200
And if they hadn't thrown me out for
incompetence of that,

1948
01:42:44,201 --> 01:42:46,360
they could have thrown me out for
incompetence at knot tying.

1949
01:42:46,570 --> 01:42:49,660
Now admittedly I've never heard of
another human being ever being thrown

1950
01:42:49,661 --> 01:42:53,500
out of the boy scouts,
but still then in my thrown out of the

1951
01:42:53,501 --> 01:42:54,370
boys.
That's right.

1952
01:42:54,490 --> 01:42:59,080
For a long time code and sit Morse code
being competent at Morse code.

1953
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:00,490
Yes.
It seems so simple

1954
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:05,080
to me it wasn't simple.

1955
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,780
So at any rate,
I mean I was too busy with theoretical

1956
01:43:07,781 --> 01:43:11,380
physics and cosmology.
You just uninterested.

1957
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:13,000
Yeah.
It wasn't that you were in competent,

1958
01:43:13,001 --> 01:43:15,060
you really never bothered to learn it
was to,

1959
01:43:15,080 --> 01:43:19,830
I had other better things to do.
Something better than Morse code before

1960
01:43:19,831 --> 01:43:20,664
that.
Right.

1961
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:24,850
So at any rate then in the,
in the summer between my freshman and

1962
01:43:24,851 --> 01:43:26,600
Sophomore Year of college,
I mean,

1963
01:43:26,601 --> 01:43:30,160
I dropped out for three or so.
I was going to back to freshman year at

1964
01:43:30,161 --> 01:43:31,870
the age of 21.
Why'd you drop out?

1965
01:43:32,470 --> 01:43:34,570
Well,
I wanted to find the beatniks.

1966
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:38,470
I wanted to find zen Buddhist Satori,
the Zen Buddha state of enlightenment.

1967
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:43,660
I was dead serious about those things.
I was in the top 10% of a class that had

1968
01:43:43,661 --> 01:43:46,120
higher meeting sats than the classes at
Harvard,

1969
01:43:46,121 --> 01:43:47,130
Mit,
and Caltech.

1970
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:48,940
That year.
It was at Reed College.

1971
01:43:48,941 --> 01:43:52,640
The school that Steve Jobs would
eventually drop out of very tough

1972
01:43:52,641 --> 01:43:53,474
school.

1973
01:43:53,780 --> 01:43:56,270
And I didn't realize I was in the top
10%.

1974
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:59,390
But nonetheless,
I had these things I wanted to do.

1975
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,620
I was inspired by on the road.
I felt the beatniks are the first people

1976
01:44:03,621 --> 01:44:06,100
who would ever accept me and my life.
Um,

1977
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:10,040
you were reliving the time you were
carried away by the children.

1978
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:10,911
Yeah.
Well,

1979
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:12,800
so,
so I,

1980
01:44:13,010 --> 01:44:18,010
I drop out of school and went seeking
Satori and the beatniks and hitchhiked

1981
01:44:18,711 --> 01:44:20,950
from Seattle down to,
um,

1982
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:24,320
the city lights bookstore op,
which was Lawrence Ferlinghetti is

1983
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:26,300
bookshop.
And that's where the beatniks yeah,

1984
01:44:26,330 --> 01:44:27,290
that's,
uh,

1985
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,480
that's where the beatniks are supposed
to be hanging out.

1986
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:33,440
And I walked into the store and it was
empty and there was a guy behind the

1987
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:36,020
counter and I probably said something
like,

1988
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:38,090
uh,
where are the beatniks?

1989
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,060
And he acted as if I wasn't even there.
Now that was hard,

1990
01:44:41,061 --> 01:44:44,620
Joe,
because I had a Jew for over kind.

1991
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:47,240
People have been wearing their short,
their hair,

1992
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:49,550
their haircuts and military haircuts,
crew cuts.

1993
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:54,970
And I had this long curly hair and no
one had ever seen anything like it

1994
01:44:54,981 --> 01:44:57,740
before.
The closest to it was the wig that Harpo

1995
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:00,200
Marx used to wear wasn't,
that wasn't the,

1996
01:45:00,230 --> 01:45:02,120
some of the members of the experience.
They get you there.

1997
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:04,850
There's a photo of you.
What does that photo from?

1998
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:10,600
Probably 1965,
1966.

1999
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:15,880
That is a patient and the guy who so,
so how could you ignore if that walked

2000
01:45:16,671 --> 01:45:20,180
into your bookstore and you'd never seen
a haircut like that before and the

2001
01:45:20,181 --> 01:45:24,530
person was barefoot in addition to that
and carrying a sleeping bag,

2002
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,860
you were barefoot with a sense.
I had been barefoot for six months and

2003
01:45:27,861 --> 01:45:30,680
your feet get so thick that you go walk
over gravel.

2004
01:45:30,681 --> 01:45:32,660
I will ask,
why are you barefoot for six months?

2005
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:37,090
It felt like the right thing to do under
the circumstances or the swelling?

2006
01:45:37,250 --> 01:45:38,600
No.
Eventually I gave it up.

2007
01:45:38,601 --> 01:45:40,240
Do you have any houses left?
No.

2008
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:41,570
No,
no.

2009
01:45:41,570 --> 01:45:45,920
I can't walk over gravel anymore.
Long for those days where you can do no,

2010
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:49,190
I like current shoes.
I love her and choose.

2011
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,930
So at any rate,
but it would,

2012
01:45:50,931 --> 01:45:54,440
you ignore what you just saw that person
with hair coming out of his head,

2013
01:45:54,441 --> 01:45:56,150
like electrocuted worms.
Love.

2014
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,240
I'd be like,
this guy has got something to say.

2015
01:45:59,241 --> 01:46:00,074
What's up?
Yeah,

2016
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,640
the guy ignored me.
So I walked out of the bookstore looking

2017
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:08,360
crushed and somebody walking down the
sidewalk said,

2018
01:46:08,870 --> 01:46:11,090
you look troubled.
Can I help you with something?

2019
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:12,950
And I said,
yeah,

2020
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:15,200
I'm,
I'm looking for the beatniks.

2021
01:46:15,290 --> 01:46:17,540
And he said,
well,

2022
01:46:17,541 --> 01:46:22,541
and he rolled his pupils up into his
forehead and he scratched his head and

2023
01:46:23,211 --> 01:46:24,530
he thought,
and he thought,

2024
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:26,900
and he thought,
and then he came out of it and he said,

2025
01:46:26,901 --> 01:46:29,330
well,
have you tried Colorado?

2026
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:35,120
Well that was just a little too vague.
A destination for Colorado.

2027
01:46:35,150 --> 01:46:36,260
Yeah.
With a beat.

2028
01:46:36,261 --> 01:46:37,250
Nixon,
Colorado.

2029
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,920
I have no idea.
He thought they might be.

2030
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:43,190
Yeah.
So I ended up hitchhiking up and down

2031
01:46:43,191 --> 01:46:45,680
the west coast with several friends gave
up.

2032
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:48,530
You gave up on the beatniks.
We gave up on the beatniks because I

2033
01:46:48,531 --> 01:46:50,520
wasn't a specific address and I didn't
want to leave.

2034
01:46:50,521 --> 01:46:52,860
What year is the West Coast?
It was 1962.

2035
01:46:53,070 --> 01:46:53,970
Uh,
you were early.

2036
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:57,720
It was two years before the sixties woke
up and realized that it was a distinct

2037
01:46:57,721 --> 01:47:01,110
decade.
It was two years before the electric

2038
01:47:01,111 --> 01:47:04,980
koolaid acid test and hung around a
little bit.

2039
01:47:04,981 --> 01:47:06,930
You would have been their perfect,
well,

2040
01:47:06,931 --> 01:47:09,090
I prefer starting my own groups
actually.

2041
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:13,410
And this group gathered around me and
around on one of my traveling

2042
01:47:13,411 --> 01:47:17,610
companions.
And we eventually ended up in a big pink

2043
01:47:17,611 --> 01:47:18,300
condemned house.

2044
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:21,360
This is all in how I accidentally
started in the 60s and a big pink

2045
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:24,510
condemned house in Berkeley,
three blocks away from the Berkeley

2046
01:47:24,511 --> 01:47:26,970
campus.
And we didn't care if it was going to

2047
01:47:26,971 --> 01:47:28,980
fall down at any minute.
Um,

2048
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:32,220
and we,
we were no close zero clothing during

2049
01:47:32,221 --> 01:47:34,500
the day.
And My,

2050
01:47:34,501 --> 01:47:38,070
I guess co leader was a guy named Dick
[inaudible] who had the body of an

2051
01:47:38,071 --> 01:47:40,560
autonomous when we walked down the
street together,

2052
01:47:40,561 --> 01:47:43,440
women could not take their eyes off of
him and,

2053
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:48,500
but they slice through me as if I were
weren't there is if I were invisible and

2054
01:47:48,501 --> 01:47:50,520
every woman wanted to sleep with him.
Um,

2055
01:47:50,730 --> 01:47:55,350
and he had this sense of somehow he had
lived a life up to that point with never

2056
01:47:55,351 --> 01:47:57,420
having a depression,
never having a doubt,

2057
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:00,690
never having a psychic pain of any kind.
It was uncanny,

2058
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:02,820
was unreal.
And,

2059
01:48:03,030 --> 01:48:06,120
and remember Michael Jackson is still
the most remarkable person I've ever

2060
01:48:06,121 --> 01:48:07,890
met,
but to cough was pretty remarkable.

2061
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,400
And so dick set the tone being naked and
Dick would go into the bathroom to do

2062
01:48:14,971 --> 01:48:17,580
the things you do in the bathroom,
but leave the door open and continuous

2063
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:20,400
conversation with you while he was in
there going.

2064
01:48:20,401 --> 01:48:25,080
So that was the norm for us.
And I was the spiritual leader of the

2065
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:30,081
group.
So at the time I was 19 or 18 years old.

2066
01:48:31,550 --> 01:48:36,300
So I like to be a spiritual leader at 19
it feels very good when people believe

2067
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:38,550
in the things that you say.
It feels very good when you're

2068
01:48:38,551 --> 01:48:42,570
hitchhiking and somebody takes you to
macarthur park in La and there are all

2069
01:48:42,571 --> 01:48:47,520
these guys on soapboxes and or aiding
their heads off about Marxism or the

2070
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:51,860
coming of Jesus or whatever.
And somebody in the crowd while you're

2071
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:54,450
just watching what's going on,
walks up to you and says,

2072
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:57,360
you look like the idiot and the Dusky
asking novel.

2073
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:00,630
So he doesn't mean that as a,
you look like an idiot.

2074
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:04,370
He's talking about something unusual.
And,

2075
01:49:04,670 --> 01:49:07,470
and I start explaining to him what I'm
doing.

2076
01:49:07,740 --> 01:49:10,590
And before long,
all of the crowds around,

2077
01:49:10,591 --> 01:49:15,591
all the guys on soap boxes with all of
the Marxist and Jesus lectures have

2078
01:49:16,231 --> 01:49:20,520
abandoned their speakers and they're all
listening to me.

2079
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:22,740
Well,
you can tell I really get off.

2080
01:49:22,741 --> 01:49:27,741
I'm talking to an audience of anywhere
from one person to 100,000 people,

2081
01:49:28,860 --> 01:49:30,480
whatever.
I don't care.

2082
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:34,860
It lights me up and so did it feel good?
Yes.

2083
01:49:34,890 --> 01:49:38,280
So you feel like that doing that as
you're calling?

2084
01:49:38,310 --> 01:49:39,660
Yes.
Yeah.

2085
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:43,560
That that's what I'm here for,
but I'm here to write the books to now

2086
01:49:43,561 --> 01:49:46,230
writing the books is a lonely
proposition.

2087
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,370
Writing is very lonely.
You have to isolate

2088
01:49:48,370 --> 01:49:51,070
yourself.
That's why I do it at a coffee shop.

2089
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:55,120
We're out of the corner of my eye can
see humans around me and where I can

2090
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:58,420
spend four hours in and be profoundly
rude.

2091
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:01,870
Because when you're in the middle of
balancing seven ideas and you're

2092
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:05,050
fashioning a sentence,
if somebody interrupts you for half a

2093
01:50:05,051 --> 01:50:05,950
second,
right?

2094
01:50:05,970 --> 01:50:07,970
All those things can go crashing and
disappear.

2095
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,680
I,
I don't understand the need to do it in

2096
01:50:11,681 --> 01:50:15,370
front of all these people because I need
the energy of other people with a lot of

2097
01:50:15,371 --> 01:50:18,040
people that live in New York City.
My friend Jeff said that he wouldn't

2098
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:20,110
live anywhere else.
He loves New York City because he gets

2099
01:50:20,111 --> 01:50:21,730
energy out all the people that live
there.

2100
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:22,700
And I can't,
I mean,

2101
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,640
I've tried Seattle,
Portland,

2102
01:50:25,210 --> 01:50:27,220
San Francisco,
San Pedro,

2103
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:30,160
and the only does it for you.
Oh yes.

2104
01:50:30,161 --> 01:50:31,600
In ways I never imagined.

2105
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:34,270
I never thought,
how long did it take before you realized

2106
01:50:34,271 --> 01:50:37,030
that that was the spot for you?
Not that long.

2107
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:42,031
Because what I realized about seven
months into it was I don't fit into

2108
01:50:42,581 --> 01:50:45,970
clique's clique's don't want me and I'm
not comfortable.

2109
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:49,510
Well,
I'm generally not lotted in clique's.

2110
01:50:49,770 --> 01:50:50,850
Oh,
you'd be whining.

2111
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:52,110
I don't really have one.
But

2112
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:56,560
that's very sweet.
That's very nice.

2113
01:50:56,561 --> 01:51:00,070
But so at any rate,
I discovered that in New York there are

2114
01:51:00,071 --> 01:51:04,420
so many people that you can pick people
one by one and put them together into

2115
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:07,600
your own clique.
And if you put them together in your own

2116
01:51:07,601 --> 01:51:09,700
clique,
you always maintain a certain central

2117
01:51:09,701 --> 01:51:11,060
role,
even if you would,

2118
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:14,920
the people that are in the clique and
you really want to advance them it,

2119
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:17,980
you're still accepted.
I um,

2120
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:20,970
I'm around giant groups of people.
So,

2121
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:26,040
so often because of the UFC doing
commentary and in these huge arenas,

2122
01:51:26,141 --> 01:51:26,974
Philippine wow.

2123
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:32,040
And then doing standup in front of
thousands of bees and then the podcast

2124
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:34,990
reaching all these people I need alone
time.

2125
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:39,490
Like I have the opposite requirement.
I need that.

2126
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:42,970
If I don't get like my writing,
I have to write a loan.

2127
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:44,650
I right when everyone's asleep,
right house.

2128
01:51:45,010 --> 01:51:48,550
I wait until everyone goes to bed and
then I do my writing and I've learned,

2129
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:50,860
I guess it's a discipline.
Yeah.

2130
01:51:51,060 --> 01:51:53,230
How would it be alone in the midst of a
lot of people?

2131
01:51:53,420 --> 01:51:55,360
Right.
And you need the energy,

2132
01:51:55,780 --> 01:51:57,810
the energy.
So what I want you to describe to me,

2133
01:51:57,811 --> 01:52:00,730
he's like,
what is the energy of these people

2134
01:52:00,731 --> 01:52:02,500
around you?
Like what is happening?

2135
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,720
First you have to understand it's not a
distraction.

2136
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:07,660
No.
We are built to take in input from other

2137
01:52:07,661 --> 01:52:10,480
human beings and to give output to other
human beings.

2138
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:12,700
And when we feel unnecessary,
as I sat,

2139
01:52:12,701 --> 01:52:17,701
her immune system goes into under dive
nose dive and so we need to be around

2140
01:52:18,611 --> 01:52:21,700
other people.
Now if you're a writer and you write and

2141
01:52:21,701 --> 01:52:24,490
I write as you said,
you need to isolate yourself.

2142
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:27,880
So I've figured out a way to be utterly
isolated in the midst of a bunch of

2143
01:52:27,881 --> 01:52:30,370
people.
I need the energy from those people

2144
01:52:30,371 --> 01:52:34,540
because otherwise I do my best writing
when I'm feeling the energy of my

2145
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:36,130
audience.
But if you don't,

2146
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:39,490
you you do.
When you do get interrupted,

2147
01:52:39,491 --> 01:52:42,190
I should say it does fuck you up.
You have,

2148
01:52:42,191 --> 01:52:46,110
so I simply writing,
I'm just saying writing.

2149
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:49,310
Oh Wow.
But I do it without ever lifting my eyes

2150
01:52:49,311 --> 01:52:51,990
from the page.
I've learned to discipline my mind.

2151
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,400
Something like that.
Fuck you manage one and a cigarette.

2152
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:56,790
Yeah,
but they,

2153
01:52:56,850 --> 01:53:00,350
they know me all.
They know I'm sure to the mayor of the

2154
01:53:00,351 --> 01:53:02,510
chocolate area,
the cafe where I work.

2155
01:53:02,511 --> 01:53:04,110
Don't give the name out man.
Well,

2156
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:08,540
I'm respected there and a lot of Weirdos
out there and when that spot that could

2157
01:53:08,541 --> 01:53:10,280
be,
but yeah,

2158
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:15,710
so but don't get about the address,
but we need,

2159
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:17,540
you know,
we need social input.

2160
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:19,760
We desperately need it.
So as you said,

2161
01:53:19,761 --> 01:53:22,670
you can only be alone after too much
social input.

2162
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:26,180
Yes.
Now I do a show called coast to coast.

2163
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:29,450
It's a crazy weird flying saucer show.
Yeah,

2164
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:32,380
it's the highest rated overnight talk
radio show in northeast Georgia.

2165
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:37,430
Nori is still the host and it's 545
radio stations and they'll one night

2166
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:40,070
that,
I mean they'll call me on no notice and

2167
01:53:40,071 --> 01:53:44,120
say we need you on tonight about the
neurovirus we need you on tonight about

2168
01:53:44,121 --> 01:53:46,940
the killing in Texas,
the school shooting in Texas.

2169
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:52,300
We need you on tonight about the Gaza
riots and Israel and you just jump on

2170
01:53:52,971 --> 01:53:56,540
and talk about it.
I like to get five hours,

2171
01:53:56,541 --> 01:54:01,520
six hours notice because I like to put
in three hours of research and bought

2172
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:03,340
one night.
I was walking out in the middle of that

2173
01:54:03,341 --> 01:54:08,341
meadow in the park looking at the stars
and my phone be answering now 1140 at

2174
01:54:08,421 --> 01:54:11,660
night or 1240 at night.
When you're commuting with the stars,

2175
01:54:11,661 --> 01:54:13,400
you don't really want to answer the
phone.

2176
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:17,300
But I'm on call for coast to coast.
I thought always on call.

2177
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:19,490
Yes,
I've done it 237 times.

2178
01:54:19,491 --> 01:54:22,010
That's crazy.
And they call me the human computer.

2179
01:54:22,460 --> 01:54:24,500
So cause they can ask me questions about
anything.

2180
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:26,240
Did you do it during the art bell days
as well?

2181
01:54:26,241 --> 01:54:28,070
Yes,
but art would have me on for four to

2182
01:54:28,071 --> 01:54:32,090
five hours and that was a hoot.
That was really a hoot.

2183
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:35,930
I did his show once.
It was a highlight of my life.

2184
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:40,310
Well art was one of the most energetic
talk show host you've ever seen in your

2185
01:54:40,311 --> 01:54:41,480
life.
Have that guy.

2186
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:45,020
So he would call at four in the
afternoon and he'd say,

2187
01:54:45,680 --> 01:54:47,330
okay,
I want you to look at this website.

2188
01:54:47,570 --> 01:54:49,760
So I go look at the website and call me
when you look at it.

2189
01:54:50,180 --> 01:54:52,250
So I'd call him again and he said,
okay,

2190
01:54:52,251 --> 01:54:55,730
now look at this website now.
Gradually I got the idea that he was

2191
01:54:55,731 --> 01:55:00,731
trying to tell me that there were extra
galactic civilizations and that they

2192
01:55:01,161 --> 01:55:04,820
were coming to earth and signaling us
through crop circles and a whole bunch

2193
01:55:04,821 --> 01:55:07,550
of other things.
But it was the way he did it.

2194
01:55:07,610 --> 01:55:10,130
He did it with such energy.
He lit a fire in you.

2195
01:55:10,490 --> 01:55:13,130
Absolutely.
Even if you totally disagreed with

2196
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:16,160
everything he was thinking,
he lit that fire.

2197
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:18,260
I used to drive home from the comedy
store at night,

2198
01:55:18,261 --> 01:55:19,850
and it was the only,
one of the only things that I would

2199
01:55:19,851 --> 01:55:22,970
listen to because it was am radio,
and I would get it from a,

2200
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:26,750
believe it was a San Diego station and
you could usually get it better late at

2201
01:55:26,751 --> 01:55:27,560
night.
Right?

2202
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:28,820
So it'd be like one o'clock in the
morning.

2203
01:55:28,821 --> 01:55:31,850
I was driving into the valley and I'd be
listening to the coast to coast with art

2204
01:55:31,851 --> 01:55:32,571
bell.
Right.

2205
01:55:32,571 --> 01:55:35,660
And a lot of people that came to have,
not a lot of people did that.

2206
01:55:35,690 --> 01:55:38,900
A lot of,
a lot of intellectuals do that as their

2207
01:55:38,901 --> 01:55:43,901
secret sin and because they're awake
late at night and there's nothing

2208
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:48,120
else really on the radio and this at
least teases a little bit of your brain.

2209
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:52,410
So I do global,
I do global history,

2210
01:55:52,411 --> 01:55:56,400
I do global geopolitics.
I do a geoeconomics.

2211
01:55:56,760 --> 01:55:58,890
Um,
I do psychology,

2212
01:55:58,891 --> 01:56:01,560
I do murders,
I do bacteria.

2213
01:56:01,561 --> 01:56:06,561
I do stars do your own show while I was
at the guy who created the show with art

2214
01:56:07,441 --> 01:56:09,570
bell who created coast to coast with art
bell,

2215
01:56:09,890 --> 01:56:13,140
um,
he wanted to do a radio show where I can

2216
01:56:13,141 --> 01:56:14,940
have as many nights of the week as I
wanted.

2217
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:19,170
And the guy who wrote conversations with
God would have the other nights.

2218
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,240
Why don't you just do a podcast?
I do,

2219
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:21,791
uh,
not,

2220
01:56:21,791 --> 01:56:23,550
not a podcast.
I do a youtube.

2221
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:24,420
Oh,
okay.

2222
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:26,430
Thing.
Why don't you put it out as a podcast as

2223
01:56:26,431 --> 01:56:27,870
well.
You can just take the audio from it.

2224
01:56:27,930 --> 01:56:30,360
Well,
I have very little time in which to do

2225
01:56:30,361 --> 01:56:33,300
this,
so I know how to put it up on youtube

2226
01:56:33,620 --> 01:56:35,220
and it doesn't get that many hits.

2227
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:38,070
I mean,
I used to do Tj Kincaid,

2228
01:56:38,071 --> 01:56:40,140
the show with him,
the amazing atheist.

2229
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:41,611
He's,
well,

2230
01:56:41,611 --> 01:56:44,930
he's fabulous and six foot eight or
something like that.

2231
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:45,783
He's a good dude.
I like that.

2232
01:56:45,860 --> 01:56:46,890
Oh,
I like him too.

2233
01:56:46,891 --> 01:56:50,250
And so he had me on for two years
running and then said,

2234
01:56:50,251 --> 01:56:53,100
you've got to start your own.
So I started up my own and he of course

2235
01:56:53,101 --> 01:56:57,690
at this point has 950,000 subscribers or
something like that.

2236
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:01,320
I have 13,400 subscribers.
Try to pump you up.

2237
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,360
That will be neat.
That would be terrific.

2238
01:57:03,361 --> 01:57:06,030
You really should do your own thing.
It's not difficult to do.

2239
01:57:06,090 --> 01:57:07,530
Right.
And once it gets set up,

2240
01:57:07,830 --> 01:57:09,090
uh,
it's fairly easy.

2241
01:57:09,770 --> 01:57:11,960
Recorder.
We'd have to set me up out.

2242
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,230
Meantime,
I said,

2243
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:17,280
but look at me.
I'm I buzz Aldrin said 12 years ago.

2244
01:57:17,281 --> 01:57:21,660
We've got a presidential election coming
up and we've got to try to get space on

2245
01:57:21,661 --> 01:57:25,500
the agenda of the things that candidates
are talking about.

2246
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,420
We've got two years in which to do it.
And I said,

2247
01:57:27,421 --> 01:57:29,010
okay,
I'll form a group to do that.

2248
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:31,770
So do this.
Let me ask you this,

2249
01:57:31,771 --> 01:57:34,770
because you're this big coast to coast
Art Bell Fan,

2250
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:39,750
right?
How much of that Ufo stuff do you pay

2251
01:57:39,751 --> 01:57:40,930
attention to?
None.

2252
01:57:40,990 --> 01:57:42,180
None.
Zero.

2253
01:57:42,181 --> 01:57:46,740
When when people contact me on Linkedin
and their major credential as they do us

2254
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:49,980
a Ufo magazine or something like that,
I don't add them.

2255
01:57:50,220 --> 01:57:53,160
I used to love that stuff.
I think it was so interesting and

2256
01:57:53,161 --> 01:57:55,200
intriguing.
Tell us I started actually paying

2257
01:57:55,201 --> 01:57:56,110
attention to it.
Yeah.

2258
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:59,100
And I started interviewing some of the
people that involved in the movement.

2259
01:57:59,310 --> 01:58:01,080
You find the same thing over and over
again.

2260
01:58:01,081 --> 01:58:06,081
This just wanton disregard for reality
is absolute desire to prove something

2261
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:13,410
instead of looking at the objective
facts that proving that aliens are real,

2262
01:58:13,411 --> 01:58:18,120
proving that we've been contacted these
eye witness testimonies are legitimate.

2263
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,910
Let me try to get across a weird idea.
Okay.

2264
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:22,560
Okay.
Um,

2265
01:58:22,620 --> 01:58:25,680
once upon a time in the 1940s,
there were two guys,

2266
01:58:25,681 --> 01:58:27,420
Connor Lorenza,
Niko Tinbergen,

2267
01:58:27,421 --> 01:58:30,240
who got a Nobel prize for inventing a
field called pathology,

2268
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:33,390
which is a certain kind of observation
of animal behavior.

2269
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:38,900
And Niko Tinbergen will go off to the
coastal cliffs around northern Europe

2270
01:58:40,530 --> 01:58:42,160
and he would observe

2271
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:44,230
the seabirds and the seabirds will go
out,

2272
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:49,090
I don't know how many miles,
10 30 40 miles and outs of the ocean to

2273
01:58:49,091 --> 01:58:50,800
feed and bring back food for their
young.

2274
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:53,770
And then they would come back at the end
of the day and their desks,

2275
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,810
they'd have 200 nests next to each
other,

2276
01:58:56,170 --> 01:59:00,880
but the ness had very low walls.
So when the seabird came back from her

2277
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:05,680
fishing and waddled herself into place,
moving her hind back and forth to get in

2278
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:09,550
place to incubator chicks to warm the
eggs,

2279
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:14,860
she'd often knock an egg out.
And when the egg was knocked out of the

2280
01:59:14,861 --> 01:59:18,300
nest,
the bird would reach her beak out past

2281
01:59:18,301 --> 01:59:23,301
the egg and then pull her beak back in
towards your chest to pull the egg

2282
01:59:23,441 --> 01:59:27,430
toward the nest.
And she do it over and over again until

2283
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:30,890
she got the egg in the nest.
And Niko Tinbergen have this word idea.

2284
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:33,970
I wish I knew where it came from that
this is a reflux.

2285
01:59:33,971 --> 01:59:36,370
You know,
like when your doctor takes a hammer and

2286
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:40,540
hammers your knee and your,
your black shoots out and you had

2287
01:59:40,541 --> 01:59:43,510
nothing to do with it.
He figured this is the same kind of a

2288
01:59:43,511 --> 01:59:48,511
reflex and he figured that if you have a
reflex you need a trigger for the

2289
01:59:49,391 --> 01:59:51,160
reflex.
Like that Patellar Hammer,

2290
01:59:51,161 --> 01:59:54,790
that hammer journey.
So he looked to see if there was a

2291
01:59:54,791 --> 01:59:59,791
trigger that triggered this yanking your
beat back on in order to scoop the ag

2292
02:00:00,641 --> 02:00:04,930
back into the nest.
And he tried building artificial eggs to

2293
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:09,220
see if he could find out what the cues
were in the ag that were causing this

2294
02:00:09,221 --> 02:00:13,180
reaction in the word.
And finally he got a super vague,

2295
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:16,120
which means I knew it was bigger than
the normal ag.

2296
02:00:16,150 --> 02:00:20,380
It was browner than the normal ag and
he'd put the real egg.

2297
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:24,250
Now if you're the bird,
that real egg has your genetic legacy.

2298
02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:28,000
It's your genetic future.
A lot is riding on that egg.

2299
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:33,540
A lot of you and the phony egg and the
phony ag would attract the bird so

2300
02:00:35,591 --> 02:00:39,760
strongly that she would ignore her own
egg and Yank,

2301
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:40,571
Yank,
Yank.

2302
02:00:40,571 --> 02:00:45,010
With her beak until she pulled the phony
egg into the nest and they continued to

2303
02:00:45,011 --> 02:00:47,680
do research with this kind of thing.
And they discovered that they could

2304
02:00:47,681 --> 02:00:52,681
trick some songbirds into taking a
basketball into their nest.

2305
02:00:53,530 --> 02:00:57,140
And then when the poor little birds
tried to get on top of the basketball to

2306
02:00:57,141 --> 02:01:00,010
incubate it,
they would slide off and they'd be very

2307
02:01:00,011 --> 02:01:03,160
frustrated and they would climb back on
again and slide off again.

2308
02:01:03,280 --> 02:01:06,700
It was cruel.
So the phony eggs like fake tits,

2309
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:08,980
those are things called supernormal
stimuli.

2310
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:12,880
And the idea is that they bring these
reflexive reactions.

2311
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:15,340
Yes.
Well underlying what Adolf Hitler was

2312
02:01:15,341 --> 02:01:18,520
doing underlying what I was doing,
dancing on that stage,

2313
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:21,610
um,
underlying what you do in front of an

2314
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:26,500
audience when you get incandescents and
lose yourself and something else talks

2315
02:01:26,501 --> 02:01:28,030
through you.
Um,

2316
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:33,210
all that is related to some super normal
pattern in us.

2317
02:01:34,390 --> 02:01:39,390
So Hitler was basically saying the world
is about to end and the Kingdom of God

2318
02:01:39,681 --> 02:01:44,681
is coming except the Kingdom of God in
his case was the world will be

2319
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:49,490
controlled by the master race,
the blonde and blue eyed ariens.

2320
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:54,860
And all other people will be slave
people or will be exterminated.

2321
02:01:55,450 --> 02:01:58,850
Um,
but it was this golden paradise that he

2322
02:01:58,851 --> 02:02:01,850
was inviting the Germans too,
in which they ruled the world because

2323
02:02:01,851 --> 02:02:05,270
they were born to rule the world.
So how did you describe the stimulation?

2324
02:02:05,271 --> 02:02:08,470
Super supernormal stimulus.
So the silver tsunami,

2325
02:02:08,490 --> 02:02:13,340
still a stimulus of this artificial egg
is like supernormal stimulus of this

2326
02:02:13,341 --> 02:02:17,010
extreme behavior at the podium,
right.

2327
02:02:17,010 --> 02:02:21,920
Attract people in.
And basically Hitler was saying,

2328
02:02:22,280 --> 02:02:25,640
I was talking about the equivalent of
extra terrestrials.

2329
02:02:25,641 --> 02:02:28,280
He was talking about this magic quality
of the Germans.

2330
02:02:28,281 --> 02:02:33,050
He was talking about the shared soul of
the Germans and how the people in Wagner

2331
02:02:33,051 --> 02:02:34,520
operas.
Um,

2332
02:02:34,790 --> 02:02:39,790
and the gods of the old Germans had been
in the souls of these people and he was

2333
02:02:40,371 --> 02:02:43,250
evoking the group soul,
the Zeitgeists.

2334
02:02:43,730 --> 02:02:44,840
Um,
the,

2335
02:02:44,841 --> 02:02:49,841
in this case is the Volk geist the
spirit of a people and the flying saucer

2336
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:55,970
people are after an end of the world in
which the world will be remade.

2337
02:02:56,360 --> 02:03:01,040
And a guy named while there was a Jewish
kid from a backward town,

2338
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:04,160
a really backward town,
and we'll only had been trained in

2339
02:03:04,161 --> 02:03:07,190
manual skills.
And he started preaching and he preached

2340
02:03:07,191 --> 02:03:10,100
that the world was,
as we know it was about to end,

2341
02:03:10,101 --> 02:03:12,170
and we were about to enter a new kind of
paradise.

2342
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:16,180
And because he was Jewish,
he figured it's got to happen at

2343
02:03:16,181 --> 02:03:20,690
Passover because of Passover.
You put out a cup for Elijah and Elijah

2344
02:03:20,691 --> 02:03:23,630
is there to proceed the savior,
um,

2345
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:26,150
the,
the guy who will save the Jewish people.

2346
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:31,160
So he went up to the holiest city in
Judaism to Jerusalem,

2347
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:33,740
and he had a dinner,
um,

2348
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:37,640
the Passover dinner,
and they put out the cop and that's when

2349
02:03:37,641 --> 02:03:39,740
the Kingdom of God was supposed to
arrive.

2350
02:03:40,280 --> 02:03:44,210
His prediction of a kingdom of God
arriving at that particular Passover

2351
02:03:44,211 --> 02:03:47,300
ceremony turned out to be utterly wrong.
And in fact,

2352
02:03:47,301 --> 02:03:52,301
the Romans seized him and nailed him to
a cross and he died.

2353
02:03:54,090 --> 02:03:56,390
It was the opposite of everything he
predicted,

2354
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:00,500
but the religion he'd put together and
the religion really that Paul put

2355
02:04:00,501 --> 02:04:04,460
together because Paul was an
international figure.

2356
02:04:04,461 --> 02:04:07,340
You know,
he was comfortable in the global world

2357
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:08,720
of the Roman Empire.

2358
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:14,200
But what Paul put together around Jesus
was a supernormal stimulus and it evoked

2359
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:20,690
a super normal response,
a supernormal reflex and the flying

2360
02:04:20,691 --> 02:04:23,300
saucer ideas that,
you know,

2361
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:26,840
here we are on earth,
but there's this brace that's above us

2362
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:29,430
that can save us.
Um,

2363
02:04:30,230 --> 02:04:34,200
that's pushing at the same buttons.
Um,

2364
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:38,220
Hitler was pushing at the same buttons,
the world as know it was about and when

2365
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:40,740
there's a new paradise and while the
Germans will rule everything,

2366
02:04:41,640 --> 02:04:45,180
um,
so we are built to receive certain kinds

2367
02:04:45,181 --> 02:04:48,660
of stimuli.
God knows how we got built that way.

2368
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:53,490
And when I went out in quest of the
ecstatic of God that God's inside of us,

2369
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:57,980
that the age of 13,
I was looking for that super normal,

2370
02:04:57,990 --> 02:05:02,990
those super normal responses in us and
for the supernormal stimuli that have

2371
02:05:03,611 --> 02:05:05,760
oic them.
And when you're doing art,

2372
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:08,340
when you were doing commentary,
when you're doing comedy,

2373
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:13,770
you are hitting the buttons,
you are creating supernormal stimuli,

2374
02:05:13,771 --> 02:05:18,771
you are testing out jokes until they
reached just the right shape and you

2375
02:05:18,901 --> 02:05:22,050
know what you can feel in the audience
what that shape is and then you repeat

2376
02:05:22,051 --> 02:05:24,720
that shape knowing what its impact is
going to be on the audience.

2377
02:05:25,140 --> 02:05:27,880
I wrote a new book,
um,

2378
02:05:29,070 --> 02:05:31,260
it took me a long time to write all of
my previous books,

2379
02:05:31,261 --> 02:05:33,140
including how I accidentally started the
60s.

2380
02:05:33,210 --> 02:05:36,150
And by the way,
it isn't the same 1995 manuscript.

2381
02:05:36,151 --> 02:05:40,410
I had 20 years of additional processing
and was able to put a lot more meaning

2382
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:43,620
and to the book and hopefully it's still
really funny.

2383
02:05:44,190 --> 02:05:46,980
Um,
but I was able to write a book in six

2384
02:05:46,981 --> 02:05:51,600
weeks.
The first draft of 178,000 word book and

2385
02:05:51,601 --> 02:05:56,601
a normal book is 90,000 words.
So this is almost twice the length of a

2386
02:05:56,761 --> 02:05:59,250
normal book.
And I was able to do it because I had

2387
02:05:59,251 --> 02:06:04,251
told all the stories in the book and I
had felt out how the audiences responded

2388
02:06:04,650 --> 02:06:09,270
to the stories and I knew the words to
use and they were a well worn path in my

2389
02:06:09,271 --> 02:06:14,271
brain.
So I simply put down on paper an oral

2390
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:19,461
vocabulary.
But it's the audience who shapes you by

2391
02:06:19,891 --> 02:06:23,070
giving you feedback and eventually you
perfect something.

2392
02:06:23,071 --> 02:06:25,500
So it's like Niko Tinbergen Super Egg.
I mean,

2393
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:28,290
newport,
Niko Tinbergen was a eventually able to

2394
02:06:28,291 --> 02:06:32,160
make egg super eggs that had dayglo on
them,

2395
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:37,410
had polka dots on them that were absurd,
but they still had the ability,

2396
02:06:37,470 --> 02:06:42,470
the way that flying saucer myths have
the ability to evoke the sense that

2397
02:06:42,751 --> 02:06:45,750
there is a paradise beyond the world
that we know.

2398
02:06:46,840 --> 02:06:50,140
Don't you think when you think of
supernormal stimulus that when you see,

2399
02:06:50,170 --> 02:06:50,921
uh,
you know,

2400
02:06:50,921 --> 02:06:54,130
like a preacher on the pulpit that's
screaming with confidence.

2401
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:59,310
When you see any of these things,
like even when it comes to fake breasts,

2402
02:06:59,500 --> 02:07:02,440
like you're seeing something like you
know what you want,

2403
02:07:02,441 --> 02:07:06,940
you want a woman to be uh,
good at bearing children,

2404
02:07:06,941 --> 02:07:09,580
right?
To have the right hip to waist ratio,

2405
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:12,670
uh,
that she's a designed to breastfeed.

2406
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:16,120
She has large press even though you know
it's fake,

2407
02:07:16,330 --> 02:07:19,480
it's still hits,
whatever that genetic button is inside

2408
02:07:19,481 --> 02:07:24,460
of your head and the alien theme,
the idea behind it,

2409
02:07:24,461 --> 02:07:26,620
the archetype is kind of like Space
Daddy,

2410
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:27,610
right?
It's like,

2411
02:07:27,611 --> 02:07:28,990
you know,
I know we're stupid,

2412
02:07:28,991 --> 02:07:31,630
but just like this guy who is screaming
on the pope,

2413
02:07:31,631 --> 02:07:35,800
it has all the answers.
Like thank God someone has all the we'll

2414
02:07:35,801 --> 02:07:36,340
space

2415
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:39,490
daddy is for the atheists space daddy.
It's for the people that,

2416
02:07:39,491 --> 02:07:41,110
you know what,
I've listened to all these people down

2417
02:07:41,111 --> 02:07:42,820
here.
I think they're full of shit,

2418
02:07:43,240 --> 02:07:46,720
but space daddy's going to help us out.
While that's the general idea,

2419
02:07:46,780 --> 02:07:47,820
is that what it is?
Yes.

2420
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,210
And when you,
as I said,

2421
02:07:49,211 --> 02:07:51,730
when you fashioned a joke,
you're fashioning it to be a supernormal

2422
02:07:51,731 --> 02:07:56,020
stimulus.
But space daddy might be real.

2423
02:07:56,021 --> 02:08:01,021
Some were because we're dealing with
numbers as a science person.

2424
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:02,010
Okay.
Um,

2425
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:05,590
I have to tell you that there's only one
place in which we've ever discovered any

2426
02:08:05,591 --> 02:08:07,330
evidence of life and it's down here on
earth.

2427
02:08:07,331 --> 02:08:12,100
So I'm a skeptic about life being
anywhere now changing to a different

2428
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:15,850
scientific perspective.
There's this thing that I call a super

2429
02:08:15,851 --> 02:08:20,851
simultaneity super synchrony.
And when the universe starts as a

2430
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:25,810
rapidly expanding sheet of nothing but
space and time,

2431
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:27,040
it space,
time and speed,

2432
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:27,933
that's all it is.

2433
02:08:28,510 --> 02:08:33,510
And when it precipitates in quarks,
which is unlikely house,

2434
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:37,860
how can space time and speed become
particles?

2435
02:08:37,870 --> 02:08:38,703
Quarks,
right?

2436
02:08:38,820 --> 02:08:40,990
Um,
the fact is that there are only

2437
02:08:40,991 --> 02:08:44,680
something like 16 different forms of
those quirks and there are a gazillion

2438
02:08:44,681 --> 02:08:47,710
of identical copies of each quark
everywhere.

2439
02:08:47,711 --> 02:08:50,260
And they all sprang into existence at
the same time.

2440
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:55,830
Fast forward a couple of million years.
Galaxies all are pretty much the same.

2441
02:08:57,610 --> 02:09:02,610
And all of them spring into existence
pretty much at the same time,

2442
02:09:03,610 --> 02:09:06,010
at least the first generation of
galaxies,

2443
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:10,990
stars ignite within those galaxies,
all following pretty much the same

2444
02:09:10,991 --> 02:09:12,910
principles.
They're all just big gravity balls.

2445
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:15,880
Um,
gravity's gravity balls all the way.

2446
02:09:15,881 --> 02:09:17,440
That's planets,
that's moons,

2447
02:09:17,710 --> 02:09:21,490
all kinds of things.
So there is this tendency for the

2448
02:09:21,491 --> 02:09:25,030
universe to do the same damn thing at
pretty much the same damn time,

2449
02:09:25,031 --> 02:09:28,300
pretty much same damned everywhere in
this cosmos.

2450
02:09:28,720 --> 02:09:31,660
And we do know that there are bio
molecules,

2451
02:09:31,661 --> 02:09:36,340
carbon based molecules being formed in
interstellar,

2452
02:09:36,341 --> 02:09:38,800
cold gas clouds,
interstellar,

2453
02:09:38,801 --> 02:09:42,340
hot gas clouds,
all kinds of unlikely places in the

2454
02:09:42,341 --> 02:09:44,590
cosmos.
But those are very simple little

2455
02:09:44,591 --> 02:09:47,670
molecules.
Even though we call them bio molecules

2456
02:09:47,671 --> 02:09:51,040
is simply means I've got carbon life
depends on molecules.

2457
02:09:51,041 --> 02:09:53,590
In the case of your genome,
if we yanked just,

2458
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:56,350
we took just one cell,
you wouldn't miss it.

2459
02:09:56,680 --> 02:09:58,780
You have 100 trillion others.
Um,

2460
02:09:58,870 --> 02:10:02,970
so we took just one cell from your body
and we took out the genome,

2461
02:10:02,971 --> 02:10:03,500
the,
the,

2462
02:10:03,500 --> 02:10:04,710
the,
the prompt,

2463
02:10:04,810 --> 02:10:08,380
what dwells to actually the genome.
So we took out the genome and we

2464
02:10:08,381 --> 02:10:10,990
stretched it out cause it's all tangled
up in the cell.

2465
02:10:11,890 --> 02:10:16,890
It would be three feet long.
So there's a big distance between a tiny

2466
02:10:17,711 --> 02:10:22,711
little molecule of ammonia in an
interstellar cloud and that huge,

2467
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:28,270
very complex,
highly ordered three foot long molecule

2468
02:10:28,271 --> 02:10:31,720
or molecule,
a single molecule that's your genome.

2469
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:35,840
Um,
and we haven't learned very much at all

2470
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:39,860
about how you go from the simple
molecules to that incredibly complex

2471
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:41,960
molecules.
The origin of life is still one of the

2472
02:10:41,961 --> 02:10:43,550
big puzzles,
but again,

2473
02:10:43,820 --> 02:10:47,590
because they're super synchrony and
super simultaneity all over the Cosmos

2474
02:10:47,591 --> 02:10:50,810
is pretty much the same thing happens at
pretty much the same time.

2475
02:10:51,230 --> 02:10:56,230
The odds are that there are millions of
other planets that have life.

2476
02:10:56,930 --> 02:11:01,400
Those are the odds.
But I settle out of side because we

2477
02:11:01,401 --> 02:11:05,720
don't have evidence of any life.
And we'd been looking since there.

2478
02:11:05,870 --> 02:11:07,790
Okay,
I'll tell you a story that seems to have

2479
02:11:07,791 --> 02:11:12,791
nothing to do with anything.
But once upon a time a manager gave me

2480
02:11:14,391 --> 02:11:16,100
an act to work with.
It was earth,

2481
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:19,280
wind and fire.
And so I read all their lyrics,

2482
02:11:19,281 --> 02:11:22,970
I read everything about them,
I studied them like a Talmudic scholar I

2483
02:11:22,971 --> 02:11:23,804
always did.

2484
02:11:24,080 --> 02:11:28,460
And finally got to their album covers.
And when I got together with,

2485
02:11:28,520 --> 02:11:30,590
um,
the leader of the band,

2486
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:33,710
Maurice White for lunch,
um,

2487
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:37,340
cause I hadn't yet learned to set up my
boundaries and tell people,

2488
02:11:37,341 --> 02:11:40,520
only work with you if I can see you in
your own environment for between one and

2489
02:11:40,521 --> 02:11:43,040
three days.
That wasn't quite at that point yet.

2490
02:11:44,090 --> 02:11:45,060
I sat with my,
uh,

2491
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,670
with,
with Maurice and said,

2492
02:11:46,671 --> 02:11:48,140
Maurice,
if I've got you right,

2493
02:11:48,141 --> 02:11:50,780
you believe that approximately 11,000
years ago,

2494
02:11:50,810 --> 02:11:54,440
people from another civilization
someplace else and now our galaxy or

2495
02:11:54,441 --> 02:11:58,670
beyond or a galaxy came to this earth
and brought us all of our technologies

2496
02:11:58,940 --> 02:12:01,940
and left the messages of their
technologies and the pyramids.

2497
02:12:01,941 --> 02:12:06,240
Have I got that right?
And Maurice Smile hold?

2498
02:12:06,860 --> 02:12:10,700
And he said yes.
And so I said,

2499
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,240
okay,
there's this scientist from Cornell

2500
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:18,980
University and he has just had a
tremendous success with the science

2501
02:12:18,981 --> 02:12:20,330
series on pbs.

2502
02:12:20,540 --> 02:12:25,540
It's the most watched series pbs has
ever had and he's trying to put together

2503
02:12:25,821 --> 02:12:29,870
an organization to find extra
terrestrial intelligence.

2504
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:34,100
So if I introduced the two of you,
would you be willing to do a benefit

2505
02:12:34,101 --> 02:12:36,320
concert for him?
Because right now he's struggling to get

2506
02:12:36,321 --> 02:12:41,321
money together and Marie said yes.
So we tracked down Carl Sagan,

2507
02:12:42,020 --> 02:12:46,910
summer cottage telephone number and I
put together a conference call between

2508
02:12:46,911 --> 02:12:50,390
Maurice White and um,
Oh God,

2509
02:12:50,391 --> 02:12:53,870
what's his name again?
Billions and billions and billions of

2510
02:12:53,871 --> 02:12:55,520
planets.
Carl Sagan.

2511
02:12:55,670 --> 02:12:57,470
Yeah.
And um,

2512
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:01,190
as soon as carl got wind of where
Maurice was coming from,

2513
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:06,730
pseudoscience conversation was over
because Karl was already gambling too

2514
02:13:07,281 --> 02:13:11,150
much on ideas that could get them
totally laughed out of science.

2515
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:14,610
So it was unfortunate,
but it's ever,

2516
02:13:14,620 --> 02:13:18,680
that was the early 1980s,
probably about nine,

2517
02:13:18,710 --> 02:13:20,450
actually.
Probably about 1980.

2518
02:13:20,480 --> 02:13:23,960
Didn't you want to just sit down with
Maurice and sort of explain what we know

2519
02:13:23,961 --> 02:13:24,470
so far?

2520
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:26,930
No,
we couldn't afford stuff based on was it

2521
02:13:26,931 --> 02:13:28,370
was,
you know,

2522
02:13:28,371 --> 02:13:30,170
it's all kinds of,
it's everywhere.

2523
02:13:30,650 --> 02:13:32,610
You can find it all over the place.
What did it make?

2524
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:34,590
Did he have like a,
a source?

2525
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,540
Uh,
not that I asked him.

2526
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:38,510
Oh,
I was too busy trying to put this,

2527
02:13:38,511 --> 02:13:39,810
yeah.
This thing together.

2528
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:41,490
And it was unfortunate.
Yes.

2529
02:13:41,491 --> 02:13:44,250
It would have been neat if the two of
them had been able to sit down and talk.

2530
02:13:44,580 --> 02:13:45,750
But Carl,
as I said,

2531
02:13:45,751 --> 02:13:47,100
you know,
when he had,

2532
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:52,250
because his first wife Lynn Margulis,
the National Academy of Science Award

2533
02:13:53,101 --> 02:13:58,101
winner and I became friends and she was
kind enough to almost mentor me and

2534
02:13:58,501 --> 02:14:00,000
Dorian Sagan,
Carl Sagan,

2535
02:14:00,001 --> 02:14:04,050
his oldest son has been a friend.
He's an absolutely brilliant science

2536
02:14:04,051 --> 02:14:05,640
writer.
You read his essays,

2537
02:14:05,641 --> 02:14:08,010
they change your perception of the
world,

2538
02:14:08,430 --> 02:14:10,310
period.
And um,

2539
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:15,990
just by having the television show,
the people in quote legitimate science,

2540
02:14:15,991 --> 02:14:19,590
we're saying Carl's not a legitimate
scientist as a whole television show.

2541
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:21,670
That's right.
Because he's getting more attention than

2542
02:14:21,690 --> 02:14:23,220
I am now.
They would never admit that.

2543
02:14:23,221 --> 02:14:26,850
That's really what was in their hearts
from people about Neil degrasse Tyson.

2544
02:14:26,851 --> 02:14:28,590
And I've heard the exact same thing that
could be.

2545
02:14:28,591 --> 02:14:31,620
And the question is whether Neil
degrasse Tyson was ever,

2546
02:14:31,650 --> 02:14:32,970
uh,
a scientist,

2547
02:14:33,210 --> 02:14:35,820
uh,
cause he's primarily been a showman most

2548
02:14:35,821 --> 02:14:37,770
of his life.
And you should see him.

2549
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,630
Joe,
I,

2550
02:14:41,340 --> 02:14:43,440
when did I see him?
Uh,

2551
02:14:43,680 --> 02:14:46,440
he,
he was at God knows what event and why.

2552
02:14:46,441 --> 02:14:50,310
I was probably there because a friend
was giving a sold out lecture at the

2553
02:14:50,310 --> 02:14:54,090
American Museum of natural history and I
didn't realize that I'm Neil degrasse

2554
02:14:54,091 --> 02:14:57,150
Tyson was going to show up and when he
showed up on stage,

2555
02:14:57,151 --> 02:15:00,390
because I consider myself competing with
them because I've always wanted my own

2556
02:15:00,391 --> 02:15:04,590
television series and Neil has been
ahead of me on everything and I'm older

2557
02:15:04,591 --> 02:15:05,424
than he is.

2558
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:06,900
So it's,
you know,

2559
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:12,090
the little pieces of grit that we pick
up and carry in her shoes and walk with.

2560
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:15,090
So at any rate,
I saw him on stage,

2561
02:15:15,150 --> 02:15:19,440
I couldn't believe it.
That man is astonishing on stage.

2562
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:24,540
He's beyond your imaginings onstage.
So I went up when it was over and it was

2563
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:28,890
buzz Aldrin who had originally
introduced us via email and said,

2564
02:15:28,891 --> 02:15:31,980
I'm the guy that Buzz Aldrin introduced
you to 12 years ago,

2565
02:15:31,981 --> 02:15:34,650
who's been emailing you every once in a
while ever since.

2566
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:37,230
And he was in the middle of a whole
bunch of people who wanted to take

2567
02:15:37,231 --> 02:15:38,790
selfies.
I don't get a lot of graphs setting

2568
02:15:38,791 --> 02:15:41,700
more.
They take selfies and there were lined

2569
02:15:41,701 --> 02:15:45,900
up to get selfies with Neil degrasse
Tyson and Neil degrasse Tyson turned his

2570
02:15:45,901 --> 02:15:47,640
back on all of them.
This is not right.

2571
02:15:47,641 --> 02:15:49,380
This is not proper.
This is not polite.

2572
02:15:49,770 --> 02:15:53,190
In order to give me a lecture about how
hard it had been to make himself into a

2573
02:15:53,191 --> 02:15:54,570
showman.
And it looks easy,

2574
02:15:54,571 --> 02:15:58,380
but it takes decades of work.
Well,

2575
02:15:58,381 --> 02:16:00,330
I appreciated him giving me the little
lecture,

2576
02:16:00,331 --> 02:16:03,090
but um,
all these people were waiting for him.

2577
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:06,420
But he is amazing.
So we talk about that incandescent

2578
02:16:06,421 --> 02:16:09,810
power.
When you go transcendent onstage and you

2579
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:13,740
become an empty pipe through which
something speaks through you,

2580
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:16,710
even though they're words that you've
thought out for years,

2581
02:16:17,100 --> 02:16:19,980
but all of a sudden they're speaking in
themselves through you.

2582
02:16:20,430 --> 02:16:23,640
Um,
and how it's the essence of the forces

2583
02:16:23,641 --> 02:16:26,460
of history,
that ability to give people the sense

2584
02:16:26,461 --> 02:16:29,160
that they've been yanked out of
themselves and are a part,

2585
02:16:29,260 --> 02:16:34,180
something bigger than themselves.
That's the super normal reflex that is

2586
02:16:34,181 --> 02:16:37,690
the most profound.
And it's the one that grabs history by

2587
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:40,090
the balls and changes its direction and
earth,

2588
02:16:40,091 --> 02:16:42,820
wind and fire had that with music and
they certainly did.

2589
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:46,570
They just didn't have it when it came to
the understanding of civilizations from

2590
02:16:46,571 --> 02:16:47,920
11,000 years ago.
Right.

2591
02:16:47,921 --> 02:16:51,100
That specialty.
That's why you and I specialize in the

2592
02:16:51,101 --> 02:16:54,640
things we do in order to add to the
collective mind that enriches the people

2593
02:16:54,641 --> 02:16:56,620
around us and us too.
That's,

2594
02:16:56,621 --> 02:17:00,790
that is so attractive to people to think
that we got it from somewhere else.

2595
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Why do you think that is?
Partly because no individual creates the

2596
02:17:06,161 --> 02:17:07,480
stone tool.
I mean,

2597
02:17:07,481 --> 02:17:09,430
there may be an individual who did it
first,

2598
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:14,410
but then it takes off the way that
gazillions of particles of identical

2599
02:17:14,411 --> 02:17:17,260
kinds show up all across the face of the
cosmos.

2600
02:17:17,500 --> 02:17:20,710
It,
it hits the Zeitgeists with just the

2601
02:17:20,711 --> 02:17:24,850
right supernormal stimulus and all of a
sudden it takes off.

2602
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:28,780
And we're all aware of the fact that we
didn't do this and we're all aware of

2603
02:17:28,781 --> 02:17:31,780
the fact that there is some super normal
intelligence.

2604
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:35,800
Um,
but we don't realize that it's we who

2605
02:17:35,801 --> 02:17:40,801
are the neurons and in the same way that
a hundred billion our arts now 86

2606
02:17:41,720 --> 02:17:43,960
billion as the figure.
So you've got 86 billion neurons in your

2607
02:17:43,961 --> 02:17:45,130
brain.
Well,

2608
02:17:45,131 --> 02:17:48,640
I got news for your Joe.
The folks in science are saying that 86

2609
02:17:48,640 --> 02:17:51,190
billion neurons as you,
which is a bloody miracle and they're

2610
02:17:51,191 --> 02:17:53,650
right,
it is a bloody miracle that or Joe Rogan

2611
02:17:53,651 --> 02:17:56,770
emerges from 86 billion neurons working
together.

2612
02:17:57,340 --> 02:18:00,220
Bod,
you're more than 86 billion neurons

2613
02:18:00,221 --> 02:18:03,610
working together.
You're 86 billion neurons working with 7

2614
02:18:03,610 --> 02:18:07,930
billion fellow human beings and the
whole bacterial world and the plant

2615
02:18:07,931 --> 02:18:11,800
world and the animal world.
And it's all contributing to who you are

2616
02:18:11,890 --> 02:18:15,580
minute by minute by minute.
So we are individual cells in this

2617
02:18:15,581 --> 02:18:18,340
collective brain.
The way that individual neurons who are

2618
02:18:18,370 --> 02:18:20,710
individually quite stupid,
um,

2619
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:25,090
are part of the collective brain that is
a Joe Rogan or Howard Bloom or anybody

2620
02:18:25,091 --> 02:18:28,180
listening.
But it's such an attractive subject that

2621
02:18:28,181 --> 02:18:29,980
you have these shows like ancient
aliens,

2622
02:18:30,010 --> 02:18:30,400
right?

2623
02:18:30,400 --> 02:18:32,530
I mean,
that's like one of the longest running

2624
02:18:32,531 --> 02:18:35,650
shows in the history.
Well because it,

2625
02:18:35,651 --> 02:18:37,870
because the,
what we,

2626
02:18:38,390 --> 02:18:43,060
we become is something larger than
ourselves.

2627
02:18:43,061 --> 02:18:48,061
It's much larger than ourselves.
And so there is something that's super

2628
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:49,840
normal.
Um,

2629
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:52,450
and we can think of it as something
supernatural,

2630
02:18:52,690 --> 02:18:55,270
but we ache,
we ache for salvation.

2631
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:58,120
And I tried to tell people,
I have a book called the genius of the

2632
02:18:58,121 --> 02:18:59,950
beast,
a radical revision of capitalism.

2633
02:19:00,220 --> 02:19:02,860
And it says that there's an
underpinning,

2634
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:06,490
um,
imperative in capitalism nobody gets,

2635
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:10,600
although capitalists have to obey it in
order to make money and it's saved my

2636
02:19:10,601 --> 02:19:13,480
neighbor,
me messianic save a hundred neighbors.

2637
02:19:13,481 --> 02:19:15,370
You get $100,
save a million neighbors,

2638
02:19:15,371 --> 02:19:17,530
you've got $1 million.
Um,

2639
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:21,310
and,
and the book talks about material

2640
02:19:21,311 --> 02:19:25,450
miracles and about secular salvation.
When I,

2641
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:29,540
when Joan jets manager came to my office
and said,

2642
02:19:29,570 --> 02:19:30,680
look,
I've got the service,

2643
02:19:30,681 --> 02:19:32,810
she's been turned down by 23 rocket
companies.

2644
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:36,470
Could you just as a favor get me one
line and cashbox that'll record company

2645
02:19:36,471 --> 02:19:39,110
and we'll sign her and the record
company will make her career.

2646
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:40,820
And I had a psych.
Kenny,

2647
02:19:40,850 --> 02:19:42,380
listen to me.
Um,

2648
02:19:42,560 --> 02:19:44,600
once you get a record company,
your troubles begin.

2649
02:19:44,601 --> 02:19:46,430
That's not when your troubles in the
record company.

2650
02:19:46,431 --> 02:19:49,790
We'll throw every conceivable obstacle
in some inconceivable obstacles in your

2651
02:19:49,791 --> 02:19:52,970
path and you have to have a panzer tank
brigade strategy.

2652
02:19:53,480 --> 02:19:57,800
And if you,
if you let me do the strategy,

2653
02:19:57,801 --> 02:20:00,070
if you work as hard as I do,
17 hours a day,

2654
02:20:00,071 --> 02:20:01,980
seven days a week,
um,

2655
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:05,360
if you do everything I tell you too,
I guarantee you will have a star in two

2656
02:20:05,361 --> 02:20:09,980
years.
What she's been turned down by 23 record

2657
02:20:09,981 --> 02:20:12,470
companies were where is there left to
go?

2658
02:20:13,020 --> 02:20:15,200
MMM.
Doesn't that means she should stop?

2659
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:18,800
No,
I only said this to two people in my

2660
02:20:18,801 --> 02:20:20,540
lifetime that I will give you a star.

2661
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:24,830
The first one was to the manager of a
band called Rufus,

2662
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:28,970
which had a number three single on the
charts at that time called tell me

2663
02:20:28,971 --> 02:20:31,360
something good.
I trapped them in a limousine.

2664
02:20:31,370 --> 02:20:34,580
I picked her up at the airport and knew
we were going to be trapped in rush hour

2665
02:20:34,581 --> 02:20:36,110
traffic and said,
look,

2666
02:20:36,111 --> 02:20:40,280
I know your band has prides itself on
its democracy,

2667
02:20:41,270 --> 02:20:45,920
but if you let me put all the attention
on your lead singer and you cover my ass

2668
02:20:45,921 --> 02:20:48,710
with the band,
I guarantee you I will give you a star.

2669
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:53,500
Those the only two times over resetting
the lead singer I was talking about with

2670
02:20:53,501 --> 02:20:56,980
this band called Rufus is named now,
see if you remember her name,

2671
02:20:57,010 --> 02:20:59,200
because this is a long time ago,
Shaka Khan.

2672
02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:02,800
Sure.
So did the prediction.

2673
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:04,970
He did.
But are we off track here?

2674
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:07,400
We're off track,
but I'm talking about have to do with

2675
02:21:07,401 --> 02:21:09,410
ancient aliens.
Like what does this have to do with this

2676
02:21:09,411 --> 02:21:11,300
desire?
These have to,

2677
02:21:11,570 --> 02:21:14,240
to know that we got our wisdom from the
stars.

2678
02:21:14,710 --> 02:21:16,990
Well,
it's not directly about that,

2679
02:21:16,991 --> 02:21:19,750
but it's occasionally you tap into
something bigger than yourself.

2680
02:21:20,110 --> 02:21:25,110
And occasionally I had visions and
occasionally those visions came true.

2681
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:29,290
And so there's something super,
not supernatural,

2682
02:21:29,740 --> 02:21:34,210
but certainly super normal about being
able to have two visions only to one

2683
02:21:34,211 --> 02:21:35,950
with Chaka Khan,
one with Joan Jett.

2684
02:21:36,910 --> 02:21:40,840
Um,
there are ways in which we form a larger

2685
02:21:40,841 --> 02:21:44,770
collective intelligence and we can some
times tap into it,

2686
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:48,880
but if we can't,
then we better believe in something

2687
02:21:48,881 --> 02:21:52,210
higher than ourselves or we have a hard
time making it on the face of the earth.

2688
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:55,210
A very,
does this make sense?

2689
02:21:55,490 --> 02:21:58,380
It does.
I don't know if it necessarily make

2690
02:21:58,381 --> 02:22:03,381
sense in the context of people having
this desire to believe that we've been

2691
02:22:03,411 --> 02:22:06,870
visited by extraterrestrials,
that we'd been shaped and molded and

2692
02:22:06,890 --> 02:22:07,730
helped.
And that,

2693
02:22:08,090 --> 02:22:08,840
I mean,
uh,

2694
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:12,410
I had a conversation recently and the
podcast with someone and we were talking

2695
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:13,244
about,
um,

2696
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:15,880
uh,
genetic inner,

2697
02:22:15,940 --> 02:22:17,600
was it theo?
We're talking about,

2698
02:22:17,630 --> 02:22:20,870
uh,
people being a product of genetic

2699
02:22:20,871 --> 02:22:21,940
engineering,
right?

2700
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:26,040
Alien DNA being introduced into primate
DNA.

2701
02:22:26,290 --> 02:22:30,900
And where's the missing link?
And I tried to crudely explain with my

2702
02:22:30,901 --> 02:22:33,120
limited knowledge of us that that's not
really the case,

2703
02:22:33,140 --> 02:22:36,870
right?
We know how humans evolved from ancient

2704
02:22:36,871 --> 02:22:38,000
hominids,
right?

2705
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:39,840
While we,
there are a lot of mysteries,

2706
02:22:39,900 --> 02:22:41,250
there are,
but there's slot.

2707
02:22:42,590 --> 02:22:44,150
Okay,
here's the deal.

2708
02:22:44,151 --> 02:22:46,500
I'm imagining that there is a higher
intelligence,

2709
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:49,200
literally hire we humans have a thing
about how sure.

2710
02:22:49,440 --> 02:22:50,830
And we're not alone.
Crayfish,

2711
02:22:50,900 --> 02:22:53,280
half a thing about heights.
Lobsters have a thing about heights.

2712
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:55,290
Lizards have a thing about heights.
Bobby dogs.

2713
02:22:55,291 --> 02:22:58,190
I have a thing about heights.
So in that we're not alone and look me

2714
02:22:58,191 --> 02:23:01,230
for a higher power in the sense of up
there.

2715
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:03,180
Yes.
Smarter than us.

2716
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:06,420
More evolved us in the future.
It makes it an architect.

2717
02:23:06,421 --> 02:23:08,790
I've always said.
Seems like what we're going to look

2718
02:23:08,791 --> 02:23:09,624
like.
Well,

2719
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:12,780
if that architect has artificially
shaped our DNA,

2720
02:23:13,200 --> 02:23:15,110
then who shaped the DNA of the
architects?

2721
02:23:15,450 --> 02:23:17,130
The archetype.
I'm saying that,

2722
02:23:17,131 --> 02:23:17,731
um,
you know,

2723
02:23:17,731 --> 02:23:20,390
the large head,
the right guys,

2724
02:23:20,430 --> 02:23:24,270
the tiny body is that we're slowly but
surely becoming less muscular,

2725
02:23:24,271 --> 02:23:28,920
more reliant on our minds.
Our minds will get larger or sex organs

2726
02:23:28,921 --> 02:23:33,921
will be thought of as being problematic
and the cause of many worries and

2727
02:23:34,270 --> 02:23:38,220
clothes and wars and strife and that
will eliminate those.

2728
02:23:38,490 --> 02:23:41,520
And that will exist almost entirely in
our minds.

2729
02:23:41,550 --> 02:23:45,250
And that this is what we're looking at
when we see the gray early.

2730
02:23:45,251 --> 02:23:49,650
And so race seems to be a problem with
people wanting to pick sides and decide

2731
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:52,440
which one's better or worse.
And so there'll be no more race.

2732
02:23:52,441 --> 02:23:56,330
Everyone will be one homogenized.
Tamala John,

2733
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:58,750
what's that word?
Homogenize.

2734
02:23:58,751 --> 02:24:01,920
It was the other one.
Homologue homolog the whole log us.

2735
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:03,450
Yeah.
What does that word?

2736
02:24:03,900 --> 02:24:05,260
Amala guys?
Yeah.

2737
02:24:05,340 --> 02:24:07,680
Homologous [inaudible].
What does that word I'm looking for?

2738
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:10,890
Whatever.
A collection.

2739
02:24:10,920 --> 02:24:15,270
Right?
All the races brought to one form and

2740
02:24:15,271 --> 02:24:20,271
everybody will share this form.
So there'll be no pros or cons.

2741
02:24:20,851 --> 02:24:23,610
Nothing better.
And everything will exist in the mind.

2742
02:24:23,611 --> 02:24:25,620
So it's another version of the Kingdom
of God.

2743
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:27,020
Yes.
And,

2744
02:24:27,090 --> 02:24:30,320
and it's strange thing is space daddy.
You know?

2745
02:24:30,330 --> 02:24:33,750
So the strange thing is that Jesus made
these predictions that the Kingdom of

2746
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:35,430
God was going to arrive at any minute.
Right.

2747
02:24:35,760 --> 02:24:39,390
And the first Christians waited around
what's going to happen at any minute.

2748
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:41,820
So first it was going to happen to any
eighth day now,

2749
02:24:41,821 --> 02:24:43,590
then any week now,
then any month now,

2750
02:24:43,591 --> 02:24:47,640
then in a year now,
then any decade or century now

2751
02:24:47,640 --> 02:24:52,640
millennium now.
And so did Jesus religion disappear

2752
02:24:53,370 --> 02:24:56,010
because it made a prediction and the
prediction didn't come true?

2753
02:24:56,880 --> 02:24:57,713
No,
not really.

2754
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:01,620
So apparently the religion is somehow a
supernormal stimulus,

2755
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:03,900
even though its predictions don't come
true.

2756
02:25:04,440 --> 02:25:09,420
There is something in us that needs a
higher something.

2757
02:25:09,930 --> 02:25:11,520
Well,
isn't the prediction of religion just

2758
02:25:11,521 --> 02:25:13,230
wait around because it's gone to come
true?

2759
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:16,020
Well,
it's been very hard to justify that

2760
02:25:16,350 --> 02:25:19,710
after it didn't come true tomorrow and
it didn't come through next year and it

2761
02:25:19,711 --> 02:25:22,830
didn't to read the scrolls and correctly

2762
02:25:24,270 --> 02:25:27,130
that has the power to hang in there for
2000 years.

2763
02:25:27,131 --> 02:25:30,160
That's astonishing.
When it's basic prediction is utterly

2764
02:25:30,161 --> 02:25:31,570
false.
There's always a,

2765
02:25:31,650 --> 02:25:35,460
every decade or so there's some group
that decides.

2766
02:25:35,461 --> 02:25:36,800
They know when the next

2767
02:25:37,120 --> 02:25:39,400
William Miller in the 18 hundreds

2768
02:25:40,340 --> 02:25:43,580
let just a few years ago,
there was billboards all across the

2769
02:25:43,581 --> 02:25:47,420
country by some group that had decided
it was going to take place on a certain

2770
02:25:47,510 --> 02:25:49,220
day.
And they were like,

2771
02:25:49,221 --> 02:25:50,450
are you ready?
And you know,

2772
02:25:50,451 --> 02:25:52,240
there's the rapture's coming,
right,

2773
02:25:52,440 --> 02:25:56,150
protect these billboards out.
And then he came and went and many

2774
02:25:56,150 --> 02:25:56,841
years,
you know,

2775
02:25:56,841 --> 02:25:57,501
and then they said,
oh,

2776
02:25:57,501 --> 02:26:01,550
we made some calculations,
we made some mistakes and there's some

2777
02:26:01,551 --> 02:26:02,370
errors.

2778
02:26:02,370 --> 02:26:03,203
Well,
it happened,

2779
02:26:03,210 --> 02:26:06,060
it happened in the 1840 William Miller
made a prediction.

2780
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:10,560
Everybody sold their goods and we're
waiting for the rapture and it didn't

2781
02:26:10,561 --> 02:26:11,910
happen.
So William o said,

2782
02:26:11,911 --> 02:26:14,610
I must have gotten my predict by my
calculations wrong.

2783
02:26:14,611 --> 02:26:18,600
Went back to the calculating board and
came back with a new calculation

2784
02:26:18,870 --> 02:26:22,410
calculation that was a year later and
amazing.

2785
02:26:22,650 --> 02:26:23,960
Remember those?
Do you remember those jeans?

2786
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:24,833
I never saw them.

2787
02:26:25,060 --> 02:26:27,740
[inaudible] 21st 2011 he is coming
again.

2788
02:26:27,850 --> 02:26:29,070
Whoops.
So,

2789
02:26:29,071 --> 02:26:31,620
but the point is that William Miller
religion,

2790
02:26:32,400 --> 02:26:35,280
even after it got it wrong,
twice is still around.

2791
02:26:35,490 --> 02:26:38,280
It's the adventist religion and it's on
two different sacks in,

2792
02:26:38,281 --> 02:26:41,760
there are at least 22 million of them
planted around the planet.

2793
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:47,060
And Michael Jackson and his mother were
Jehovah's Witnesses.

2794
02:26:47,190 --> 02:26:50,100
Um,
which I believe is one of the William

2795
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:54,780
Miller based religions.
So it if you fashion the religion right

2796
02:26:55,470 --> 02:26:59,020
as a supernormal stimulus,
like those eggs with Polka dots and day

2797
02:26:59,180 --> 02:27:04,180
that still were able to outfox the real
eggs or out stimulate the mother.

2798
02:27:05,191 --> 02:27:06,410
Yes.
Um,

2799
02:27:07,270 --> 02:27:11,620
it'll last and we humans think that
we're all about rational prediction and

2800
02:27:11,621 --> 02:27:12,760
control.
No,

2801
02:27:12,761 --> 02:27:13,530
we're not.

2802
02:27:13,530 --> 02:27:18,530
But in the face and the understanding
that in the greater view of the

2803
02:27:19,111 --> 02:27:20,790
universe,
what we understand about the universe,

2804
02:27:20,791 --> 02:27:23,160
we are so minuscule,
right?

2805
02:27:23,161 --> 02:27:25,650
More we pay attention to it.
The more we,

2806
02:27:25,651 --> 02:27:29,760
it's just sort of embedded into our
consciousness that there is,

2807
02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:34,680
there is a vast universe out there and
there are so many possibilities and it's

2808
02:27:34,681 --> 02:27:39,681
so overwhelming that this,
this framework of religion or a cult or

2809
02:27:40,890 --> 02:27:45,000
whatever you want to call it becomes
sort of like a scaffolding in which you

2810
02:27:45,001 --> 02:27:50,001
can sort of operate inside of this
impossibly large thing that we exist in

2811
02:27:53,160 --> 02:27:53,993
and yet still have,

2812
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,780
well that's a good hypothesis that it
brings things down to a scale we can

2813
02:27:57,781 --> 02:27:58,580
comprehend.

2814
02:27:58,580 --> 02:28:03,580
I think of it as almost like a a a
bridge to evolution of us being wild aid

2815
02:28:05,241 --> 02:28:10,241
creatures to us having language and
comprehension and this concept of our

2816
02:28:10,881 --> 02:28:14,600
position in the university being so
small and then what is the point of all

2817
02:28:14,601 --> 02:28:15,670
this and we'll,
we'll it,

2818
02:28:15,671 --> 02:28:17,990
let's give them a points that they can
make it to the next juncture.

2819
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:23,100
Well there's a rabbinic idea and this is
from 1500 or something like that

2820
02:28:23,601 --> 02:28:26,330
probably in Poland and the rabbi said,
God,

2821
02:28:26,331 --> 02:28:28,910
left creation,
half finished show we should be forced

2822
02:28:28,911 --> 02:28:32,160
to finish the other half.
That's the version I like.

2823
02:28:32,220 --> 02:28:36,200
I like because it puts,
it puts the onus on us.

2824
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:38,990
And God,
I wish I had my computer,

2825
02:28:38,991 --> 02:28:42,050
my laptop here because I'd read you an
epigram that I wrote.

2826
02:28:42,051 --> 02:28:44,280
That's my favorite.
But basically Jamie,

2827
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:46,810
for all we know,
well it's,

2828
02:28:46,811 --> 02:28:50,360
it's in the laptop and your laptop over
there.

2829
02:28:50,390 --> 02:28:52,630
Yeah.
But um,

2830
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:57,260
one way or the other.
The fact is every time we do something

2831
02:28:57,261 --> 02:28:59,420
new,
like inventing the smartphone,

2832
02:28:59,750 --> 02:29:03,430
which Steve Jobs did,
we add to the repertoire,

2833
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:05,660
but we add to the repertoire of the
cosmos.

2834
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:07,610
Right?
Because the cosmos has never done it

2835
02:29:07,611 --> 02:29:08,810
before.
So far as we know.

2836
02:29:09,500 --> 02:29:11,870
And even if there were civilizations on
other planets,

2837
02:29:11,871 --> 02:29:13,640
they be taking a path different than
ours.

2838
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:19,090
So we are like the searcher bees.
Our entire civilization is like one

2839
02:29:19,311 --> 02:29:21,710
search or be in a possible cosmic
intelligence,

2840
02:29:21,711 --> 02:29:24,440
assuming that there are other living
things,

2841
02:29:25,070 --> 02:29:27,800
conscious things,
intelligent things elsewhere.

2842
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:30,380
And eventually we will patch all these
pieces together.

2843
02:29:30,650 --> 02:29:33,530
But right now we're patching together
the pieces from

2844
02:29:35,180 --> 02:29:36,710
trillions more than true.
I mean,

2845
02:29:36,711 --> 02:29:40,010
if they're just a trillion cells in you
alone,

2846
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:42,470
then think of all the cells were
patching where you got there.

2847
02:29:42,471 --> 02:29:44,840
When we bring together all the creatures
of the sea,

2848
02:29:44,841 --> 02:29:48,050
all of the creatures of the land,
all of the microbial creatures,

2849
02:29:48,051 --> 02:29:52,910
all of the visible creatures,
and somehow allowing them to influence

2850
02:29:53,150 --> 02:29:55,790
our collective brain as we influence
them.

2851
02:29:56,840 --> 02:30:00,740
Imagine what life would be like for
bacteria if they couldn't have you as a

2852
02:30:00,741 --> 02:30:05,741
vehicle and they couldn't force you to
get into your car and go down to Ralph's

2853
02:30:06,950 --> 02:30:09,620
and by low them,
those damn chocolate eclairs,

2854
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:13,130
the bacterial world would not be the
same.

2855
02:30:13,490 --> 02:30:15,680
You have given bacteria,
new powers,

2856
02:30:16,190 --> 02:30:20,540
and they have given you powers you
wouldn't have without them possibly

2857
02:30:20,541 --> 02:30:22,910
powers that allowed you to evolve in the
first place.

2858
02:30:22,940 --> 02:30:24,740
Well,
they think it changes your personality.

2859
02:30:24,741 --> 02:30:29,150
Now the gut biome actually affects the
way you think about the world that you

2860
02:30:29,151 --> 02:30:31,180
live in.
So you know about some or another

2861
02:30:31,190 --> 02:30:33,740
shaping you.
You know about this illness that you get

2862
02:30:33,741 --> 02:30:34,760
from cats.
Now,

2863
02:30:34,761 --> 02:30:37,660
when it takes over a cat,
toxoplasmosis,

2864
02:30:37,700 --> 02:30:39,620
when it's actually what it takes over a
rat.

2865
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:43,460
Rats are normally repelled by the smell
of cat urine.

2866
02:30:43,940 --> 02:30:46,700
And when toxoplasmosis takes over and a
rat's brain,

2867
02:30:46,701 --> 02:30:50,060
all of a sudden the raddison attracted
by,

2868
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:51,860
um,
the smell of rat urine.

2869
02:30:51,890 --> 02:30:55,400
Why?
Because the toxoplasmosis spends its

2870
02:30:55,401 --> 02:31:00,401
life part of it in the mouse or rat and
part of it in the cat.

2871
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:04,190
So at a certain point,
it has to drive you over to where the

2872
02:31:04,191 --> 02:31:08,000
cat is likely to find you in order to
get itself into the cat.

2873
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:13,450
Now think about this.
How the hell does a bacteria learn or

2874
02:31:13,970 --> 02:31:17,240
bacterial colony because they think in
groups of 7 trillion,

2875
02:31:17,810 --> 02:31:20,010
um,
how do they think

2876
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:23,910
out how to drive the rat as if it were a
robot?

2877
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:27,420
And as if it were a tank and they were
at the controls?

2878
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:32,070
How do they manage to evolve a lifestyle
in which they spent part of their life

2879
02:31:32,071 --> 02:31:34,500
in one creature and another part of
their life?

2880
02:31:34,501 --> 02:31:37,200
I don't another creature.
How do they know the anatomy and the

2881
02:31:37,201 --> 02:31:40,710
brains of those creatures so incredibly
well?

2882
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:43,320
Um,
we have no idea.

2883
02:31:43,650 --> 02:31:45,810
We haven't even considered the question.
Well,

2884
02:31:45,811 --> 02:31:48,540
it's a fascinating concept because the
be the cat,

2885
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:53,780
the bacterial colony has to actually get
into the cat's Gut,

2886
02:31:54,260 --> 02:31:55,410
right?
Reproduce.

2887
02:31:55,610 --> 02:31:57,810
You can't reproduce outside of the cats
gut,

2888
02:31:57,930 --> 02:31:59,400
right?
Which is just insane.

2889
02:31:59,810 --> 02:32:02,490
And so it has to figure out a way to get
into the cat's gut.

2890
02:32:02,520 --> 02:32:06,390
And the best way to do that is to get
into a rat and rewire the red sexual

2891
02:32:06,391 --> 02:32:07,380
reward system.

2892
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:10,230
We had some Paul ski on the podcast.
Paul skis,

2893
02:32:10,231 --> 02:32:11,880
terrific.
Broke it all down for us.

2894
02:32:11,881 --> 02:32:15,840
And as he's talking about it,
you're just trying to imagine how long

2895
02:32:15,841 --> 02:32:17,060
this took.
Well,

2896
02:32:17,090 --> 02:32:20,760
[inaudible] one of the macarthur genius
award winners who said that the God

2897
02:32:20,761 --> 02:32:24,210
problem was a great book,
the Gospel Album,

2898
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:26,070
uh,
how a godless cosmos creates.

2899
02:32:26,580 --> 02:32:27,151
So,
yeah,

2900
02:32:27,151 --> 02:32:30,240
we have all these mysteries I had of us,
but every mystery we solve,

2901
02:32:30,241 --> 02:32:32,910
for all we know,
it's the very first time that the cosmos

2902
02:32:32,911 --> 02:32:37,911
is ever pondered that mystery and then
solve the mystery and then turn the

2903
02:32:38,401 --> 02:32:43,200
result into a tool that is a hard thing
for people to acknowledge or even

2904
02:32:43,201 --> 02:32:47,820
consider that we might be the only ones
that have gotten to this point.

2905
02:32:48,060 --> 02:32:51,840
And that some say if human intelligence
and exists and we know it does,

2906
02:32:52,290 --> 02:32:55,950
that it is as far as we know on this
planet,

2907
02:32:55,980 --> 02:33:00,450
the peak of intelligence and least in
terms of its ability to affect and

2908
02:33:00,451 --> 02:33:01,500
change its environment.

2909
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:06,530
Right.
And we assume that if something can

2910
02:33:06,751 --> 02:33:09,180
reach this point here,
that it's reached that point somewhere

2911
02:33:09,181 --> 02:33:10,470
else,
but not necessarily,

2912
02:33:10,740 --> 02:33:12,360
well,
it would be different,

2913
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:15,060
but somewhere it had to have been the
first place.

2914
02:33:15,290 --> 02:33:17,430
And why wouldn't it be here?
Well,

2915
02:33:17,460 --> 02:33:18,360
uh,
in,

2916
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:20,700
um,
James fallows new book,

2917
02:33:21,390 --> 02:33:24,240
he's talking about,
I think it's Dakota and there's some

2918
02:33:24,241 --> 02:33:27,960
river that goes through Dakota and on
one side of the river,

2919
02:33:27,961 --> 02:33:30,480
the culture is one way on the other side
of the river.

2920
02:33:30,481 --> 02:33:33,240
The culture is another way.
Even with all of our modern

2921
02:33:33,270 --> 02:33:36,540
communications technologies,
there are still differences and the

2922
02:33:36,541 --> 02:33:40,860
universe,
at least the universe in the case of

2923
02:33:40,861 --> 02:33:45,861
life and we only know of life on planet,
is constantly stretching out fingers

2924
02:33:46,291 --> 02:33:51,291
into an use territories.
It's constantly taking,

2925
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:55,140
it's doing the opposite of entropy.
It's todd certainly taking chaff and

2926
02:33:55,141 --> 02:33:59,070
garbage and stuff that seems like it
would have nothing to do with life and

2927
02:33:59,071 --> 02:34:04,071
turning it into Pistons and pillars and
fuel for life.

2928
02:34:07,290 --> 02:34:08,490
For example,
we humans,

2929
02:34:08,491 --> 02:34:12,780
right now we're under the influence of
another end of the world religion

2930
02:34:13,110 --> 02:34:14,790
looking toward a different kind of
paradise.

2931
02:34:14,970 --> 02:34:18,400
It's called environmentalism and says
that we humans

2932
02:34:18,460 --> 02:34:21,700
are causing climate change,
but now that's,

2933
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:25,330
this is a little silly.
We humans may be contributing to climate

2934
02:34:25,331 --> 02:34:28,090
change,
but climate change has been the norm on

2935
02:34:28,091 --> 02:34:32,500
this planet for 4.5 billion years.
This is one of those sacred

2936
02:34:32,590 --> 02:34:35,070
science subjects that's almost like,
hey,

2937
02:34:35,080 --> 02:34:36,580
you're not allowed to talk about
scientific.

2938
02:34:36,581 --> 02:34:39,610
Jesus cannot question the the ancient
scrolls

2939
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:41,310
and it's an end times,
right?

2940
02:34:41,311 --> 02:34:42,430
Belief system.
Yeah.

2941
02:34:42,490 --> 02:34:46,420
Because it says the world's about to end
because of things we've done because

2942
02:34:46,421 --> 02:34:49,900
we've sin.
And if we simply sacrifice to the

2943
02:34:49,901 --> 02:34:53,320
goddess of nature to Geyer,
um,

2944
02:34:53,560 --> 02:34:57,790
the universal go back to being a stable,
a climatically stable garden of Eden.

2945
02:34:57,791 --> 02:34:59,050
While I got news for you,
this,

2946
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:03,730
this planet has never been climatically
stable in the very beginning.

2947
02:35:04,090 --> 02:35:07,330
It wheeled around its access once every
six hours.

2948
02:35:07,690 --> 02:35:10,060
That means we pick any point on the
surface.

2949
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:15,450
It was in this poisonous stuff called
radiation for three hours.

2950
02:35:16,810 --> 02:35:20,230
Then it was yanked into darkness,
which is equally destructive.

2951
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:24,880
And the temperature would go up a
minimum of 86 degrees every whoops,

2952
02:35:24,910 --> 02:35:27,640
up and down 86 degrees every three
hours.

2953
02:35:28,210 --> 02:35:31,930
That's climate change.
Plus it was on a tilt and it was

2954
02:35:31,931 --> 02:35:35,830
rotating around the sun.
And as it rotated,

2955
02:35:35,890 --> 02:35:37,840
the climate went through hideous
changes.

2956
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:38,750
But,
but this is

2957
02:35:38,750 --> 02:35:42,470
way in the past and when people are
concerned with what our role and what

2958
02:35:42,471 --> 02:35:44,020
impact human racist,
doesn't it

2959
02:35:44,090 --> 02:35:46,400
matter what we need to be after his
climate state.

2960
02:35:46,401 --> 02:35:50,270
If we really want the climate to be the
way it wasn't 1650 before the industrial

2961
02:35:50,271 --> 02:35:51,860
revolution.
That's our human choice.

2962
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:57,770
That's biogenic in origin and we need to
acknowledge that.

2963
02:35:57,771 --> 02:36:01,310
That's what we have decided and now
we're going to develop climate

2964
02:36:01,311 --> 02:36:02,770
stabilization to my questions.

2965
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:05,830
Those what?
Why is it such a sacred subject?

2966
02:36:06,040 --> 02:36:07,570
If you,
what you've just said,

2967
02:36:07,690 --> 02:36:11,110
even just questioning for a moment and
saying that environmentalism is a type

2968
02:36:11,111 --> 02:36:14,320
of religion,
climate denialist uhmm you could be

2969
02:36:14,321 --> 02:36:18,340
labeled with that and then people would
love to break it down in a very simple

2970
02:36:18,490 --> 02:36:23,490
one sentence statement and call you
climate denialist right.

2971
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:27,970
Climate Change denialist that son of a
bitch and the next thing you know what?

2972
02:36:27,971 --> 02:36:30,100
People will repeat that.
It doesn't have to have any,

2973
02:36:30,101 --> 02:36:33,630
nobody will want to sign you anymore for
a book contract or anything for any,

2974
02:36:34,180 --> 02:36:37,990
any complexity or context in,
in what you're trying to say.

2975
02:36:37,991 --> 02:36:40,810
They don't want the,
the subtle nuance of what you're trying

2976
02:36:40,811 --> 02:36:41,980
to express.

2977
02:36:42,030 --> 02:36:45,280
While there was a blunt nuance,
we have to develop climate stabilization

2978
02:36:45,281 --> 02:36:46,870
technologies have taken Carmen,
I don't know.

2979
02:36:46,871 --> 02:36:50,860
The atmosphere is a carpet stabilization
technology than so be it.

2980
02:36:51,160 --> 02:36:53,380
But we have to develop others because
this,

2981
02:36:53,410 --> 02:36:58,180
this globe goes through ice ages and
global warming's it went through.

2982
02:36:58,181 --> 02:37:00,910
Answer is in technology.
Yes.

2983
02:37:01,390 --> 02:37:03,190
That's what the answer is always been
for humans.

2984
02:37:03,191 --> 02:37:04,510
I mean,
why were we born?

2985
02:37:05,410 --> 02:37:07,880
Look,
we have this chemical in our gut called

2986
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,630
assist to Keenan and it only goes off
when we eat meat.

2987
02:37:11,200 --> 02:37:14,500
So we're bilty meet and it's a bonding
hormone like Clark.

2988
02:37:14,501 --> 02:37:17,040
Oxytocin brings people together.
Um,

2989
02:37:17,150 --> 02:37:19,670
so if you're having a good meat meal
with a bunch of people,

2990
02:37:19,940 --> 02:37:22,670
this is a chemical in your routes that
says these are good people.

2991
02:37:22,671 --> 02:37:24,980
Stick with them.
Don't tell the Vegan says,

2992
02:37:25,300 --> 02:37:27,470
well,
so how,

2993
02:37:27,471 --> 02:37:31,610
why if we were born to eat meat,
don't we have claws?

2994
02:37:32,210 --> 02:37:36,260
Why don't we have ripping fangs?
Why don't we have for,

2995
02:37:36,380 --> 02:37:40,130
cause we figured out a way to cook it
because we make clothes,

2996
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,570
right?
Gardens.

2997
02:37:41,720 --> 02:37:45,290
We figured out a way to figure it out,
a way to isolate ourselves from the

2998
02:37:45,291 --> 02:37:48,100
environment in terms of housing and
view.

2999
02:37:48,110 --> 02:37:49,190
Got It.
Troll of fire.

3000
02:37:49,250 --> 02:37:52,550
You got it.
And that means that we were born naked.

3001
02:37:52,580 --> 02:37:57,580
We were naked apes for a reason because
we are homo [inaudible],

3002
02:37:58,070 --> 02:38:00,800
whatever that word would be.
We are the people of tools.

3003
02:38:01,370 --> 02:38:03,740
Um,
and we developed the first stone tool to

3004
02:38:03,741 --> 02:38:08,300
the best of our knowledge,
approximately 3.1 to 3.4 million years

3005
02:38:08,301 --> 02:38:10,760
ago,
long before we became modern humans.

3006
02:38:11,180 --> 02:38:16,180
So we were born in this peculiar way at
that is naked and without claws and

3007
02:38:16,331 --> 02:38:18,590
without ripping things.
Um,

3008
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:23,240
after we developed the tools,
it took like fire and cooking,

3009
02:38:23,241 --> 02:38:25,100
which you just cited,
um,

3010
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:30,280
to allow us to have artificial clause,
artificial ripping fangs to cook our

3011
02:38:31,341 --> 02:38:32,174
meals.

3012
02:38:32,380 --> 02:38:34,460
Um,
the big conclusion of a book that I've

3013
02:38:34,461 --> 02:38:37,340
just read on what makes us different
from a neural scientist,

3014
02:38:37,341 --> 02:38:41,330
she's the neuroscientist who corrected
the standard figure for the number of

3015
02:38:41,331 --> 02:38:46,331
neurons in the brain from 100 billion to
86 billion by actually counting them.

3016
02:38:47,450 --> 02:38:50,030
She says,
what made us human was cooking just what

3017
02:38:50,031 --> 02:38:53,150
you said,
because when you cook,

3018
02:38:53,151 --> 02:38:56,570
you have,
you liberate all whole mess of calories

3019
02:38:56,571 --> 02:39:01,571
and nutritive sources that are not
available to a gorilla that's eating

3020
02:39:03,560 --> 02:39:06,080
leaves.
And how do we know that?

3021
02:39:06,081 --> 02:39:09,740
Because the gorillas born with a pot
belly the size of a Franklin stove,

3022
02:39:10,530 --> 02:39:12,830
um,
because it needs is huge digestive

3023
02:39:12,831 --> 02:39:15,410
apparatus in order to handle those
leaves,

3024
02:39:15,470 --> 02:39:17,330
to break them down into food,
right?

3025
02:39:17,750 --> 02:39:21,140
While when you cook,
you don't need that huge got now the

3026
02:39:21,141 --> 02:39:24,320
bacteria or the,
the ape is not able to go very far.

3027
02:39:24,321 --> 02:39:26,960
The gorilla,
he's certainly can't migrate.

3028
02:39:26,960 --> 02:39:30,410
Once you know,
you see Jane Goodall and she is pleading

3029
02:39:30,411 --> 02:39:32,900
for us to save the habitat of the
chimpanzees.

3030
02:39:33,230 --> 02:39:37,010
Have you ever seen Jane Goodall pleading
for us to save the Habitat of baboons?

3031
02:39:38,030 --> 02:39:41,120
Never.
The baboons are the rats of Africa.

3032
02:39:41,570 --> 02:39:45,890
Baboons are extraordinarily adaptive.
They're extraordinarily curious.

3033
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:49,550
They're always finding new environments
and figuring out ways to turn them into

3034
02:39:49,551 --> 02:39:53,510
food.
Chimpanzees don't have that quality.

3035
02:39:53,511 --> 02:39:56,660
The reason we need to save their
environment is because they're so dumb

3036
02:39:56,661 --> 02:40:01,490
as a group because the collective
intelligence of a group of chimpanzees

3037
02:40:01,491 --> 02:40:05,390
is so low that now that they're adapted
to an environment that's the only

3038
02:40:05,391 --> 02:40:08,510
environment they can adapt to.
Whereas baboons who have smaller

3039
02:40:08,511 --> 02:40:12,700
individual brains have greater
collective smarts.

3040
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:15,750
Do you seen how baboons have
domesticated dogs?

3041
02:40:16,170 --> 02:40:17,670
No.
Yeah.

3042
02:40:17,850 --> 02:40:20,790
Yeah.
The divest domesticated house dogs and

3043
02:40:20,791 --> 02:40:24,690
figured out a way to keep the dogs near
them so they can be alerted to when some

3044
02:40:24,691 --> 02:40:29,691
bad intruders or in that's amazing,
crazy kidnap these dogs and hold them

3045
02:40:30,421 --> 02:40:32,640
hostage and feed them right.

3046
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:35,080
And the dog's just kind of learned to
hang around them.

3047
02:40:35,090 --> 02:40:37,080
Well,
their ideal of hunting companion.

3048
02:40:37,081 --> 02:40:38,610
Yeah.
It's very bizarre.

3049
02:40:39,530 --> 02:40:41,350
Well,
we did once upon a time and,

3050
02:40:41,351 --> 02:40:44,400
and you could say very easily,
it wasn't us who tame dogs.

3051
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:48,030
It was dogs who team Gos.
Look how well we treat them.

3052
02:40:48,210 --> 02:40:49,580
Here it is right here.
See the,

3053
02:40:49,590 --> 02:40:52,080
they hold onto these dogs that dogs
tried to get away.

3054
02:40:52,110 --> 02:40:54,000
Oh,
is that a puppy in its shoulder?

3055
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:55,560
It's a puppy on the ground.
Oh,

3056
02:40:55,620 --> 02:40:56,970
I see.
And they,

3057
02:40:57,030 --> 02:40:59,880
they eventually stay with them in these
camps,

3058
02:40:59,881 --> 02:41:01,620
but they hold them hostage.
Look,

3059
02:41:01,650 --> 02:41:03,330
amaze,
dragging this dog.

3060
02:41:03,331 --> 02:41:04,170
Right.
He's not killing it,

3061
02:41:04,171 --> 02:41:07,470
not eating it,
but they have somehow or another figured

3062
02:41:07,471 --> 02:41:09,960
out that if they keep these dogs around
long enough,

3063
02:41:09,961 --> 02:41:12,840
the dogs will bark when intruders and
predators are near.

3064
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:13,670
Oh,
amazing.

3065
02:41:13,670 --> 02:41:15,270
Crazy.
Absolutely amazing.

3066
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:16,290
Really crazy stuff.

3067
02:41:16,320 --> 02:41:19,020
But remember that was,
we were just looking at baboons.

3068
02:41:19,320 --> 02:41:22,070
Baboons have brains smaller than the
brain of a chimpanzee.

3069
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:23,760
If you've ever seen a chimpanzee do
that.

3070
02:41:23,970 --> 02:41:24,780
No.
No.

3071
02:41:24,780 --> 02:41:28,020
Chimpanzees are not highly adaptive.
What's the measure of intelligence?

3072
02:41:28,021 --> 02:41:29,360
Ability to adapt.
Yeah.

3073
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:31,500
Okay.
So let's see how we measure the

3074
02:41:31,501 --> 02:41:35,940
intelligence of bacteria knowing that
bacteria work in a group of 7 trillion

3075
02:41:35,941 --> 02:41:38,340
and have a collective intelligence
within that group.

3076
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:42,960
And they have a collective multi colony
intelligence because they,

3077
02:41:43,050 --> 02:41:48,050
once they develop certain genetic trex,
they pass the tricks around and little

3078
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:50,610
tiny envelopes for all practical
purposes.

3079
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:53,580
Um,
so they're constantly sharing new

3080
02:41:53,581 --> 02:41:57,630
bacterial tricks.
So we are told by the environmentalist

3081
02:41:58,500 --> 02:42:00,920
the new end times movement,
um,

3082
02:42:01,230 --> 02:42:05,490
that we have used up all the resources
on this planet.

3083
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:10,200
We have vastly overburdened this planet.
We are eking it out of existence,

3084
02:42:11,340 --> 02:42:16,110
but bacteria are 12 miles beneath our
feet right now.

3085
02:42:16,800 --> 02:42:21,210
And they are turning raw rock granite
into bio stuff.

3086
02:42:21,750 --> 02:42:23,940
Now if the task of life is to kidnap,
seduce,

3087
02:42:23,941 --> 02:42:28,530
and recruit as many dead Adams as
possible into the grand project of life,

3088
02:42:29,370 --> 02:42:34,140
who's doing the best job right now?
Who recognizes that for every ounce of

3089
02:42:34,141 --> 02:42:38,430
living stuff on the planet,
there are a hundred million ounces of

3090
02:42:38,431 --> 02:42:42,300
dead stuff waiting to be kidnapped and
seduced to recruited into the grand

3091
02:42:42,301 --> 02:42:47,301
project of life bacteria.
Yet it our bacteria nature.

3092
02:42:48,480 --> 02:42:51,900
You Bet your ass.
So what does nature telling us through

3093
02:42:51,901 --> 02:42:55,770
these bacteria,
you have 100 trillion more ounces.

3094
02:42:56,430 --> 02:42:59,940
Yes,
a hundred trillion more ounces or a

3095
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:03,150
hundred million more ounces of dead
stuff for every living outs you've got.

3096
02:43:03,420 --> 02:43:07,590
And your obligation on behalf of life is
to do what the bacteria are doing,

3097
02:43:07,890 --> 02:43:10,050
kidnap,
seduce and recruit as many dead animals

3098
02:43:10,051 --> 02:43:12,100
as possible and bring them into the
project of life.

3099
02:43:13,120 --> 02:43:15,790
Use Technology to stabilize the
environment.

3100
02:43:16,250 --> 02:43:17,230
That's what we choose.

3101
02:43:17,230 --> 02:43:20,050
Yes,
and that is what we've chosen and but

3102
02:43:20,051 --> 02:43:23,350
people are not regarding it as a choice
there regarding it as something imposed

3103
02:43:23,351 --> 02:43:25,250
on them by a higher force.
Right?

3104
02:43:25,330 --> 02:43:26,380
No,
I'm sorry.

3105
02:43:26,430 --> 02:43:29,410
Gaya.
Mother Nature is not a higher force.

3106
02:43:29,411 --> 02:43:33,370
Mother Nature is a bitch.
Mother nature throws every conceivable

3107
02:43:33,371 --> 02:43:35,740
obstacle warpath and she can't help it.
Why?

3108
02:43:35,770 --> 02:43:38,260
Because our planet,
in addition to the fact that we are on a

3109
02:43:38,261 --> 02:43:41,920
tilted access,
so we go through a climate change called

3110
02:43:41,921 --> 02:43:42,401
summer,
fall,

3111
02:43:42,401 --> 02:43:44,740
winter,
and spring every single year.

3112
02:43:44,770 --> 02:43:46,540
And it's a pretty violent climate
change.

3113
02:43:47,020 --> 02:43:49,560
And we have a planet that's been ice
baller,

3114
02:43:49,580 --> 02:43:51,760
snowball or twice.
And it's history.

3115
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:55,960
The fact is the planet is on a
trajectory,

3116
02:43:55,961 --> 02:43:57,490
on a path,
on a voyage,

3117
02:43:57,491 --> 02:44:01,920
on a mission that is scarier than the
mission of Frodo,

3118
02:44:01,940 --> 02:44:06,370
the hobbit.
It is circling the core of the galaxy

3119
02:44:06,550 --> 02:44:10,290
approximately every 235 million years.
And as it,

3120
02:44:10,330 --> 02:44:14,200
as it goes through that long voyage
around the center of the galaxy,

3121
02:44:14,650 --> 02:44:19,650
it goes through spiral arms of galaxies.
The change our climate dramatically.

3122
02:44:20,350 --> 02:44:24,670
It gathers something like a hundred
trillion tons of cosmic dust,

3123
02:44:25,270 --> 02:44:27,940
um,
per year.

3124
02:44:28,510 --> 02:44:33,510
And at certain points it goes through
clouds of cosmic fluff that triple the

3125
02:44:34,991 --> 02:44:39,991
amount of that dust that we gathered,
which changes the climate considerably.

3126
02:44:40,450 --> 02:44:44,680
And we go through a milankovitch cycle.
It changes the climate every twenty two

3127
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:46,660
thousand forty thousand and 110,000
years.

3128
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:51,490
Not Precisely,
but in that range.

3129
02:44:52,270 --> 02:44:55,150
So yes,
if we want to stabilize the climate,

3130
02:44:55,151 --> 02:44:57,850
take responsibility for your decision
already.

3131
02:44:58,420 --> 02:45:03,420
Admit that this is a biogenic decision
and then go after climate stabilization

3132
02:45:03,851 --> 02:45:04,900
technologies.
Yes,

3133
02:45:04,930 --> 02:45:08,620
try removing carbon from the atmosphere,
see if it works,

3134
02:45:09,250 --> 02:45:14,250
but in the long haul,
we are on a 12,000 year passage and what

3135
02:45:14,840 --> 02:45:16,480
school climate has been relatively
stable.

3136
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:21,780
That's not normal.
The norm is rapid climate change much

3137
02:45:21,971 --> 02:45:26,971
more rapidly than we've seen an ice ages
and they alter so we better damn well

3138
02:45:27,491 --> 02:45:28,301
learn these things.
Now,

3139
02:45:28,301 --> 02:45:33,301
when I was in Japan a few years ago,
I'm in a conference about harvesting

3140
02:45:33,671 --> 02:45:36,460
solar power in space and transmitting it
down to Earth,

3141
02:45:37,300 --> 02:45:42,100
which is carbon neutral and a source of
such tremendous amounts of power that it

3142
02:45:42,310 --> 02:45:46,330
defies description.
There was a woman from the European

3143
02:45:46,330 --> 02:45:47,141
Space Agency and she said,
well,

3144
02:45:47,141 --> 02:45:51,220
if you guys are going to build these
giant solar harvesting farms,

3145
02:45:51,520 --> 02:45:55,060
these five mile by five mile raise of
photovoltaic panels,

3146
02:45:55,990 --> 02:45:58,840
when you see a hurricane heading for
Jamaica,

3147
02:46:00,100 --> 02:46:05,100
send down a laser beam,
lays the outer edges of the hurricane so

3148
02:46:06,611 --> 02:46:11,611
that you change the heat at a certain
point on that hurricane and redirect it

3149
02:46:12,111 --> 02:46:13,400
so it doesn't hit Jamaica.

3150
02:46:13,970 --> 02:46:16,550
So it goes harmlessly out to see,
well,

3151
02:46:16,551 --> 02:46:19,820
that's the beginning of harnessing these
things,

3152
02:46:19,821 --> 02:46:22,760
harnessing disasters as energy
opportunities.

3153
02:46:23,630 --> 02:46:25,760
Now have we ever done that?
Well,

3154
02:46:25,761 --> 02:46:29,150
what about flyer?
If you'd been the first one to start

3155
02:46:29,151 --> 02:46:31,160
playing with fire,
your momma would have told you,

3156
02:46:31,460 --> 02:46:33,440
look,
you see all those dead animals in there

3157
02:46:33,441 --> 02:46:35,960
that have been roasted,
a barbecued by this forest fire.

3158
02:46:36,350 --> 02:46:39,350
You want to become one of them.
Put that back where it belongs.

3159
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:42,620
And fire saved us,
um,

3160
02:46:43,280 --> 02:46:46,250
at the heart of a jet,
at the heart of a piston and the person

3161
02:46:46,251 --> 02:46:47,540
of a car.
What do we have?

3162
02:46:47,660 --> 02:46:50,660
Explosions.
Explosions.

3163
02:46:51,230 --> 02:46:54,410
That's one of the most devastating
catastrophes we can imagine.

3164
02:46:54,470 --> 02:46:56,660
An explosion.
What causes this?

3165
02:46:56,661 --> 02:47:01,130
Very rigid and I don't want to say
scientific dogma,

3166
02:47:01,160 --> 02:47:06,160
but dogma in terms of the way you're
allowed to talk about climate change.

3167
02:47:07,340 --> 02:47:09,620
Well,
there are certain aspects of science

3168
02:47:09,621 --> 02:47:13,220
that our religion,
because we science people are built with

3169
02:47:13,221 --> 02:47:17,870
the same super normal responses in us
that the flying saucer people have in

3170
02:47:17,871 --> 02:47:18,590
them.

3171
02:47:18,590 --> 02:47:22,970
And that the Christians who still
believe in the coming of the Kingdom of

3172
02:47:22,970 --> 02:47:24,140
God,
you can't debate this.

3173
02:47:24,141 --> 02:47:26,650
This is not something like even what you
said so far is,

3174
02:47:26,651 --> 02:47:28,040
is out heresy.
Yeah.

3175
02:47:28,041 --> 02:47:30,280
A little bit of solute.
Harrison people would get angry at you.

3176
02:47:30,410 --> 02:47:32,090
Well,
one person did.

3177
02:47:32,091 --> 02:47:33,920
There was a,
an astronomer,

3178
02:47:34,250 --> 02:47:36,740
um,
who would go on up to Canada for God

3179
02:47:36,741 --> 02:47:39,410
knows what reason.
He wrote a book on the evolution of the

3180
02:47:39,411 --> 02:47:41,090
cosmos.
I thought it was brilliant.

3181
02:47:41,390 --> 02:47:44,960
My friend Eshel Been Jacob,
my colleague who was the head of the

3182
02:47:44,961 --> 02:47:49,670
physics department at the University of
Tel Aviv and the head of the Physical

3183
02:47:49,670 --> 02:47:52,610
Association,
the Association of all physicists in

3184
02:47:52,790 --> 02:47:55,760
Israel where they have some pretty good
physicists said,

3185
02:47:56,030 --> 02:47:57,410
oh,
Lee will talk to you.

3186
02:47:57,590 --> 02:47:59,210
Um,
he's very open guy.

3187
02:47:59,630 --> 02:48:02,210
And when I got hold of Lee,
I forget his last name,

3188
02:48:02,480 --> 02:48:05,360
but you would recognize it.
Lee sent me a note saying,

3189
02:48:05,361 --> 02:48:06,590
well,
it's a pleasure to meet you,

3190
02:48:06,591 --> 02:48:09,740
but that article that you are in the
Wall Street Journal about climate was

3191
02:48:09,741 --> 02:48:10,574
unfortunate.

3192
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:12,770
Uh,
it was something a little harsher than

3193
02:48:12,771 --> 02:48:14,300
that.
Um,

3194
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:18,770
meaning you have sinned and,
and I watched this movement developed

3195
02:48:18,771 --> 02:48:23,300
from the beginning and it developed by
using conformity enforcers.

3196
02:48:23,720 --> 02:48:26,030
Will that Al Gore movie tipped it over
the top.

3197
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:30,190
It helped a lot of things that just
people had,

3198
02:48:30,230 --> 02:48:31,730
they realized they had,
I mean,

3199
02:48:31,731 --> 02:48:33,800
if you want a virtue signal,
you got to get on board.

3200
02:48:34,190 --> 02:48:35,023
Well,
um,

3201
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:39,950
what really put the environmental
movement on the map was Earth Day and

3202
02:48:39,951 --> 02:48:44,240
the guy who pulled that off really
pulled off an amazing pr stunt that was

3203
02:48:44,241 --> 02:48:47,720
just an astonishing pr stone.
And if that's what started it off,

3204
02:48:47,870 --> 02:48:49,160
yes,
yes.

3205
02:48:49,430 --> 02:48:52,850
Because in the 1950s,
when I was the head of the program

3206
02:48:52,870 --> 02:48:56,690
committee at my high school,
I programmed in a guy who talked to us

3207
02:48:56,691 --> 02:49:01,100
about what was being done to Wales and
the pictures were horrifying.

3208
02:49:01,430 --> 02:49:05,200
This guy was a giant,
he was about six foot two and and it

3209
02:49:05,201 --> 02:49:09,660
always days that was really,
really tall and he was most severe

3210
02:49:09,661 --> 02:49:10,920
person I'd ever met.

3211
02:49:11,490 --> 02:49:15,540
He walked in without acknowledging me.
I had booked him at all.

3212
02:49:15,930 --> 02:49:18,810
He had a frown on his face that was
unbelievable.

3213
02:49:19,470 --> 02:49:22,770
He walked out with that same serious
frown,

3214
02:49:22,800 --> 02:49:27,720
uncompromising without saying goodbye,
without saying thank you without any of

3215
02:49:27,721 --> 02:49:31,800
the normal social graces and he didn't
have a name for what he was doing.

3216
02:49:32,160 --> 02:49:36,870
Conservation was the name of what he was
doing back then and it was Earth Day.

3217
02:49:36,871 --> 02:49:40,680
That put another word on the map,
environmentalism and that God

3218
02:49:40,681 --> 02:49:45,000
environmentalism into first grades and
second grades and fourth grades.

3219
02:49:45,001 --> 02:49:48,540
When kids are at an imprinting age,
when their brains are little relieving

3220
02:49:48,541 --> 02:49:52,920
fashioned around some of the key things
that they absorb at that age.

3221
02:49:53,070 --> 02:49:56,340
When we talk about impressionable,
we're talking about a certain element of

3222
02:49:56,341 --> 02:49:59,790
the morphology of the brain that wraps
itself around certain things and then

3223
02:49:59,791 --> 02:50:03,480
never lets them go.
And environmentalism was built to get

3224
02:50:03,481 --> 02:50:05,970
into the brains of young people and
never leave.

3225
02:50:06,690 --> 02:50:11,690
And eventually environmentalism
developed its own end of the earth

3226
02:50:12,750 --> 02:50:16,470
scenario.
It tried to develop one in 1968 when

3227
02:50:16,471 --> 02:50:19,380
Paul Ehrlich,
who was a butterfly specialist,

3228
02:50:20,050 --> 02:50:24,660
um,
said that by 1980 which rimmer in 1968

3229
02:50:24,661 --> 02:50:27,300
was 12 years away.
So that's like my talking about

3230
02:50:27,301 --> 02:50:32,301
something that will happen in 2030.
It seemed a long ways away and he said

3231
02:50:34,141 --> 02:50:37,830
by 2000,
by 1980 we would get to the point where

3232
02:50:37,831 --> 02:50:40,770
there were so many people on the planet
that we'd have to stand on each other's

3233
02:50:40,771 --> 02:50:42,840
shoulders.
There would be no room for us.

3234
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:47,200
We would vastly outstrip the carrying
capacity of the universe,

3235
02:50:47,250 --> 02:50:51,690
meaning the food supply would run out.
It would not be able to keep up with our

3236
02:50:51,691 --> 02:50:54,060
population growth.
And as a consequence,

3237
02:50:54,061 --> 02:50:57,240
in the early 1980s,
people would die by the hundreds of

3238
02:50:57,240 --> 02:51:00,960
millions in India and China.
And even the United States now.

3239
02:51:01,140 --> 02:51:03,060
Rumor back to those days,
Joe,

3240
02:51:03,061 --> 02:51:04,950
I don't know if you know the history of
it.

3241
02:51:05,250 --> 02:51:10,080
You were probably born after it,
but did remember all the hundreds of

3242
02:51:10,080 --> 02:51:13,260
millions of people dying in India and
China and the United States.

3243
02:51:13,261 --> 02:51:16,650
Remember how your parents had a stand on
each other's shoulders in order to find

3244
02:51:16,651 --> 02:51:19,050
room to live and I don't recall that.
You don't,

3245
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:23,010
what's wrong with you?
I don't understand so much like the

3246
02:51:23,011 --> 02:51:24,960
apocalyptic cults.
They moved the goalposts.

3247
02:51:24,990 --> 02:51:26,130
Yeah,
exactly.

3248
02:51:26,220 --> 02:51:30,240
And so now it's climate change and
originally it was global warming and

3249
02:51:30,241 --> 02:51:33,390
then they smartened up to the fact that
they better cover their ass just in case

3250
02:51:33,391 --> 02:51:37,230
we had an ice age instead of warming and
glass.

3251
02:51:37,260 --> 02:51:42,000
What is the planet of global warming and
climate change?

3252
02:51:42,030 --> 02:51:43,210
This one.
Yeah,

3253
02:51:43,410 --> 02:51:46,440
big time.
So they are right and they are wrong.

3254
02:51:47,850 --> 02:51:51,330
We need to do these climate
stabilization technologies.

3255
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:53,850
We must,
I mean we've been doing them.

3256
02:51:53,910 --> 02:51:57,420
You said it best.
We've been doing ever since we invented

3257
02:51:57,720 --> 02:52:01,050
the fur coat,
which allowed us to get out of Africa

3258
02:52:01,051 --> 02:52:03,330
and go to the forest ends of Asia.

3259
02:52:03,330 --> 02:52:08,010
When we were still far from being modern
humans that uh,

3260
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:12,610
the technology of the cave and beyond
that the technology of the hot,

3261
02:52:13,210 --> 02:52:16,420
all these are climate stabilization
technologies on a small scale.

3262
02:52:16,630 --> 02:52:20,530
Now we need to do climate stabilization
technology and our big soul scale.

3263
02:52:20,560 --> 02:52:22,390
No,
that does not mean that we have to put

3264
02:52:22,391 --> 02:52:26,410
software droplets into the atmosphere to
keep the sun from warming the surface of

3265
02:52:26,411 --> 02:52:28,270
the earth that we so stupid.
It's ridiculous.

3266
02:52:28,420 --> 02:52:33,420
It's not a reversible move.
But if you have a laser for her

3267
02:52:33,850 --> 02:52:35,440
harnessing space,
solar power,

3268
02:52:35,680 --> 02:52:39,520
and you use it to redirect hurricanes,
you can see what worked the first time

3269
02:52:39,521 --> 02:52:42,910
and try something different the second
time and the third time until you

3270
02:52:42,911 --> 02:52:47,170
perfect it.
You can't do that with sulfur docs to

3271
02:52:47,180 --> 02:52:49,760
droplets Lutsen the atmosphere.
That's one of the stupidest things I've

3272
02:52:49,761 --> 02:52:50,600
ever heard in my life.

3273
02:52:50,840 --> 02:52:55,250
But that's the first solution,
technological solution to come out of

3274
02:52:55,251 --> 02:52:57,410
all of their climate,
people's smells,

3275
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:59,900
but we need to do what they're talking
about.

3276
02:52:59,901 --> 02:53:02,570
We just have to take ownership of it.
Howard Bloom,

3277
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:04,220
we've got to wrap this up.
Very,

3278
02:53:04,221 --> 02:53:07,350
very enjoyable conversation.
But I'm having really appreciate it.

3279
02:53:07,400 --> 02:53:11,060
I having a great deal of fun.
So if you need me in the future,

3280
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:14,270
you can get me on the phone,
which is how I do coast to coast.

3281
02:53:14,300 --> 02:53:15,060
Let's do it.
Yeah.

3282
02:53:15,060 --> 02:53:18,290
How often are you in la?
Very seldom.

3283
02:53:18,350 --> 02:53:20,980
Very seldom.
As I'm on my own dime here and I,

3284
02:53:21,010 --> 02:53:23,150
while I would be happy to fly you out if
you're willing to come,

3285
02:53:23,180 --> 02:53:28,180
while I would love the comments,
do I look like I would ever say no to

3286
02:53:28,711 --> 02:53:30,860
your conversation with you?
Let's do it again.

3287
02:53:31,290 --> 02:53:33,890
We really appreciate it,
Howard Bloom,

3288
02:53:33,891 --> 02:53:34,724
ladies and gentlemen,

3289
02:53:36,310 --> 02:53:37,620
how much,
what time is it?

3290
02:53:49,050 --> 02:53:49,180
Hmm?
