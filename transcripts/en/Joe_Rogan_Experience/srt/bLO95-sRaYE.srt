1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,770
This is going to be a rough transition,

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:09,771
but seeings how I have to go do my
podcast pretty quick on the topic of

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:10,950
podcasts.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,341
You know,

6
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,330
I'm being sued.

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,283
Yes.

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,480
And uh,

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,520
explain that to people because it's one
of the dumbest fucking lawsuits I've

10
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,360
ever heard in my life.

11
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:22,410
But there's people that make a living
off of these types of lawsuits right

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:22,740
there.

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,230
Yeah.

14
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,660
Called Patent trolls.

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,340
They buy up patents and
their lawyers and it Sorta,

16
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,440
I think it's this country at its worst.

17
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,460
I really do.

18
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:37,461
It's they buy patents and then they shoe
companies saying they're using stealing

19
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:40,950
or unlawfully using their technology.

20
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,590
And sometimes when
you're buying technology,

21
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,120
there's a real good argument to that.

22
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:49,020
Like that technology is a part of
this thing that you're selling.

23
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,280
And without that technology,

24
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,360
which is patented,

25
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,810
your technology while you're
selling would not exist.

26
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,440
Right.

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,440
And I get that part and
I support innovation and
people should be paid for for

28
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,460
intellectual property and creative ideas.

29
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,140
But this is a weird one.

30
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,170
This is what is the exact term that,

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,200
that they have a patent on the exact
cause they have a patent on a playlist.

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,520
Yes.

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,680
So on anything in a serial order,

34
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:16,951
right,

35
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,550
right.

36
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,550
Like even blogs I evidently anything
that's comes out on a Monday and then the

37
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:29,160
next one comes out on a Tuesday or this
song is above that song and the song's

38
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,840
number three and that song's number seven.

39
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,070
That's what they claim
to have dominion over.

40
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:37,860
So if you have a blog and
you enter into the blog,

41
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:40,110
like a blog entry number one,

42
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:43,650
you know a Adam goes to do podcasts
to talk about this lawsuit,

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,660
they could sue you for that.

44
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,310
Like they own a piece of that,

45
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:50,490
a serialized message that
you're putting on a website.

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:50,911
Yeah.

47
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,340
Numbered message that that's correct.

48
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:54,210
That's insane.

49
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,630
Well this insane because if it's true
then really everything on the Internet's

50
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,200
got to go away.

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,711
Everything.

52
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:05,190
Could you imagine if they bought up
everything on the Internet with one sneaky

53
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,024
move?

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,410
Like one sneaky move,

55
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,700
one patent with the judge says,

56
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:08,881
look,

57
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,631
the guy's got a point.

58
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,820
He owns everything in serialized form.

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,773
Well,

60
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,650
the problem is is I don't think the
judge or the jury is going to think they

61
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:17,484
have a point.

62
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,110
Unfortunately,

63
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,590
in order to make our point
that they don't have a point,

64
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,990
it's going to cost one point $5 million.

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,730
Holy Shit.

66
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,730
Holy Shit.

67
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,330
That's what patent litigation costs.

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,950
That's what the legal
fees are going to be.

69
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,790
That's what,

70
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,590
that's what I've been quoted.

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,790
Oh my God.

72
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,791
I've been quoted 1.25 to 1.5 wow.

73
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,151
Yeah.

74
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,901
That's stunning.

75
00:02:45,901 --> 00:02:47,370
I never would have thought
it would be that high.

76
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,620
So are they always spring hate a lot,

77
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,150
so it was,

78
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,851
is that what it is?

79
00:02:50,851 --> 00:02:51,780
It's all the lawyers.

80
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,100
That's what it is.

81
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,640
It's all the lawyers and that.

82
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:57,240
How much work did they have to do here,

83
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,273
Joe?

84
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,440
For me it's like first off,

85
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,340
I spent $50,000 trying to get
a change of fucking venue.

86
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,620
These guys are in eastern Texas.

87
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,150
That's where they set up because
eastern Texas is famous for him.

88
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,930
Leave to their types of folk.

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,531
Yeah.

90
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,820
If to this type of thing.

91
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,230
Patent troll lawsuits.

92
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,350
I don't live in eastern Texas and my
businesses in eastern Texas and they don't

93
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,000
live in eastern Texas either.

94
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,240
That's just where they've hung their
shingle and they hung their shingle

95
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:35,230
specifically because this is a place
it's advantageous to do things like this

96
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,590
well is it's what you would do if you
were company that bought up other people's

97
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:46,411
technology and then tried to sue other
businesses and make money off of them.

98
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,150
You're going to maximize that.

99
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,040
The possibility of you getting an outcome
that's in your favor and you'll do it

100
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:55,450
on the moon if you have to.

101
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:55,721
Now,

102
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,240
if these people come to you
with some sort of a settlement,

103
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,381
like if they said,

104
00:03:59,381 --> 00:03:59,771
hey,

105
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,011
you know,

106
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,300
you're using our technology,

107
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:02,680
we would like five bucks a month.

108
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,150
Like anything along those lines.

109
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,810
Yes.

110
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:05,920
$3 million.

111
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,480
Whoa.

112
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,480
And this because they've,

113
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,580
they've won these before the same company.

114
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,320
They got $8 million from apple,

115
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,770
right?

116
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,280
Yeah.

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:15,551
It's,

118
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:20,551
it's unclear what I'm doing with
them and what they're doing with me,

119
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,830
but it's a pretty simple equation,

120
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,570
which is I just said,

121
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:25,871
look,

122
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:30,871
all the guys in podcasting need to kind
of band together and we need to fight

123
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,700
them and then we need to beat them.

124
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,260
And then once we beat them,

125
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,543
then their beat,

126
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,030
because they can't go after you or mark
Marin or whoever once we beat them.

127
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,210
But if we allow this to just go away,

128
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,620
it's not going to,

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,191
if we say,

130
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:48,371
well,

131
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,990
let's just put it aside and you know,

132
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:50,950
fucking ignore them,

133
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,963
then they win.

134
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,540
I mean,

135
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,040
it's a possibility that they could win.

136
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,300
There's no way.

137
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,111
Look,

138
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:57,130
when you get sued,

139
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:57,920
you get sued.

140
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,020
He got to respond.

141
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,550
But you know,

142
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,870
let's just say,

143
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,400
we said,

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,233
look,

145
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,240
you guys obviously haven't
done the math on our company,

146
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,920
but you know,

147
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,120
it's,

148
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,170
it's a business.

149
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,320
No one wants to spend the time and the
1 million plus dollars to fight this

150
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:17,740
thing,

151
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,573
you know,

152
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,790
take 350 grand and please go away
or 500 grand or a hundred grand,

153
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,850
whatever it is.

154
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,980
Well how long before they
go to iTunes and they go,

155
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:33,300
oh,

156
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,150
let's see who else is doing okay over
here on iTunes and they take a piece of

157
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,280
steel in all right.

158
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:39,791
Now,

159
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,770
last time we did this with Corolla,

160
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,220
we got 500 k out of him when we chose
good for and all we got to do is do the

161
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,750
same thing we did with Corolla.

162
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,853
He knows,

163
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,420
I mean we'll let,

164
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,730
we'll let Joe's attorneys coach 'em up,

165
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,870
but they're going to tell you this,

166
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,020
the most expensive kind of litigation
is going to cost over a million dollars.

167
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,171
I mean,

168
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:01,690
he can go on the Internet
and looked at them.

169
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,840
Do you know that these human
beings are behind this?

170
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,160
Do you know the actual human beings?

171
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,113
Uh,

172
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,860
are you aware of names or faces?

173
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,703
You know what they look like?

174
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:09,651
No,

175
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:10,191
I don't.

176
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,470
And I never think that way.

177
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,240
Like I,

178
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I just think that I understand that we
live in a world that is generally decent

179
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,720
and that these people probably think
of themselves as generally decent.

180
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,471
You know,

181
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:30,050
they probably have kids that
love them and a wife that,

182
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:30,710
uh,

183
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,660
it gives him a blowjob on occasion.

184
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,820
This is what they do for living.

185
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,920
This is their business.

186
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,400
And I think when a guy works at a used
RV lot and he's got an Rv on that lot

187
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:48,530
that's worth $4,000 and some elderly
couple comes in there and he gets them for

188
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:49,364
20 grand,

189
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,620
he doesn't go home and
stare in the mirror and go,

190
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,280
wow,

191
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,690
I'm a really bad human being.

192
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,560
He goes,

193
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,150
I'm a fucking great salesman.

194
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,320
And I think that's what these guys do.

195
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:02,750
I don't even fault them.

196
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,970
And on a personal level,

197
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,200
like they make money from doing this,

198
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,000
I understand it.

199
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:11,930
Um,

200
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,681
it's no,

201
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:17,030
it's not even worth trying
to make it a personal issue.

202
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:19,130
I don't feel it's a personal issue.

203
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,560
They saw my podcast,

204
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,110
I'm actually in a bizarre way,

205
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:24,944
flattered.

206
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,780
They saw my podcast and said,

207
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,910
that guy's really doing well for himself.

208
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,220
I kids go get one to 3 million bucks.

209
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,580
That's,

210
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,413
that's insane.

211
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,580
That was their first offering.

212
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,110
So it's stunning.

213
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,640
What we're doing is we're getting everyone
together and we're going to show him

214
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:44,360
that the podcast community is a
lot stronger than they thought,

215
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,490
that they fucked with the wrong people.

216
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,960
And I don't mean me,

217
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:52,961
I mean everybody and that whether you're
a Joe Rogan fan or Adam Carolla fan or

218
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:54,200
an NPR fan,

219
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,120
it's all going away if we don't
buck up and beat these guys.

220
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:02,230
So we just went to fund anything D.

221
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,570
Dot com forward slash pan trawl and you
can give toward the legal defense fund.

222
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,880
This is a video up there to watch where
Adam explains the whole situation and

223
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:14,210
uh,

224
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,450
what's going on and,

225
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:16,221
and spread this,

226
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,240
spread it on Twitter,

227
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,890
spread it on Facebook.

228
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,700
Let everybody know if you can't donate it,

229
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:26,660
at least spread the word and let people
know what the fuck is going on because

230
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:27,110
uh,

231
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,441
yeah,

232
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,670
this is a crazy thing.

233
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,510
It's just a weird
byproduct of our society,

234
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,523
right?

235
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,910
I don't like it,

236
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,220
but there's nothing we could do
about it at this point in time.

237
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,091
No.

238
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,924
Other than that,

239
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,663
this

240
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,590
is really cool because this could
be a seminal moment for podcasting,

241
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,720
which you guys fucked with the wrong guys.

242
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,100
We're all grassroots,

243
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,450
but we all band together.

244
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,720
We all got our little individual little
armies and we all got them United and we

245
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,890
all fought this common cause.

246
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,050
You know what I love about podcasting?

247
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,070
That I do think that that's something
that fits with the ethic of podcasting.

248
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,590
But I also love that podcasting isn't,

249
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,160
it's,

250
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,600
it's not a competitive thing in that
everybody supports everybody else in

251
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:12,434
podcasting.

252
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,150
I've never heard of podcast feuds like
morning Dj guys always fucking hate the

253
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:18,320
other morning Dj Guy,

254
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:18,650
right?

255
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,820
And they always talk shit about him.

256
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:21,170
But podcasts,

257
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:21,480
I,

258
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,710
I've,

259
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,230
I don't know anybody who says like,

260
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,951
you know,

261
00:09:24,951 --> 00:09:25,131
uh,

262
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,220
we would be fucking doing great if
it wasn't for that Adam Carolla show.

263
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:32,870
Everybody's watching that stupid shows
sucks our podcasts is the future that

264
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,670
shows for old people fuck out.

265
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:35,150
You know,

266
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:35,720
that doesn't,

267
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,340
it doesn't seem to be going on at all.

268
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,510
I think the Internet,

269
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,350
the attitude of the Internet is that
what you're dealing with the world,

270
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,180
you're dealing with an
infinite amount of people.

271
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,190
It's so God damn big that having that
sort of famine mentality that a lot of

272
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:53,210
people have if they are in
morning radio in a specific city,

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,410
you don't need it in,

274
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,250
in the Internet.

275
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,491
No.

276
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:56,840
I listen every,

277
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,160
I feel like,

278
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,083
uh,

279
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,530
you know the last podcast I did yesterday,

280
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:08,531
Jay Mohr and Jo Koy were both guests on
the show and they both have podcasts and

281
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,760
80% of the guests on my show have
their own podcasts and we promote their

282
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,770
podcasts on my podcast.

283
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,191
Yes.

284
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:20,910
So that's all you need to know,

285
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,390
right?

286
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,970
We do the exact same thing
and I'm always telling people,

287
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,290
you should do a podcast,

288
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,610
like people that are good guests.

289
00:10:26,611 --> 00:10:27,060
I'm like,

290
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,770
why don't you do your own podcast all,

291
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:30,360
you don't even need a place like this.

292
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:31,230
You need a fucking MP,

293
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,430
three recorder and a microphone.

294
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,000
That's it.

295
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,450
Right?

296
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,500
Upload it online.

297
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:36,180
It takes 10 seconds and boom,

298
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,530
you have a fucking podcast.

299
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,071
Well,

300
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,780
the plan is podcasters
unite rally your army.

301
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,870
And let's beat this.

302
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,641
Let's do it.

303
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:45,091
We're in,

304
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,760
we're in 1000% that's
not even a real number.

305
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,500
It's only a hundred percent as possible.

306
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,580
We're in that,

307
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,650
but we'll say a thousand
like your hyperbole.

308
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,750
I liked that you liked it.

309
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,271
So fun.

310
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:57,270
anything.com forward slash patent troll,

311
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,400
please go there.

312
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,600
If you can't donate,

313
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:05,340
please spread the word so that other
people can find out about it and that can

314
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,031
donate.

315
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:06,451
I get it.

316
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:06,991
If you're broke,

317
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:08,010
I totally understand it.

318
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:08,844
But if you do,

319
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,391
uh,

320
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:14,070
appreciate podcasting and
you do appreciate Adam's
show and his network and he's

321
00:11:14,071 --> 00:11:14,904
got a whole network.

322
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,320
And then on top of that,

323
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,630
everybody else that you know
that does podcasts with,

324
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,660
it's Joey Diaz or Ari Shaffir
or Duncan Trussell Adams,

325
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:21,931
right?

326
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,880
That would all go away if it wasn't for,

327
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,320
uh,

328
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,700
if,

329
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:25,980
you know,

330
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,900
if we can't figure out
