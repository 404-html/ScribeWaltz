1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,180
Three,
two,

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,000
this is live,
ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,170
and this is a very unusual podcast we're
going to have here and a very unusual

4
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:17,180
discussion I have to my left and Michael
Shermer,

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:20,450
very famous skeptic.
He's been on the podcast before,

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,220
of course,
Randall Carlson,

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:27,320
amazing gentleman who knows far too much
about terrifying things like asteroids

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,570
and Graham Hancock author,
also a fantastic human being,

9
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:37,400
many times been on this podcast as well,
and this all came out of a podcast that

10
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:42,401
Randall and Graham and I did recently
and Michael Shermer commented on it and

11
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:45,780
it was all essentially on the,
um,

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,820
the,
the hypothesis that the great extinction

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,300
that happened with the North American
land animals that happened somewhere

14
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,230
around the end of the ice age and,
um,

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,220
the end of the ice age,
the abrupt end of the ice age being

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,380
caused.
Please correct me if I fuck this up

17
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,010
being caused by a comet impact.
Um,

18
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,540
Michael Shermer had some questions about
that and we said this would be an

19
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:15,470
amazing podcast to get everybody
together in a room and go over this.

20
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,390
Since then,
there's been some interesting stuff

21
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:18,950
that's happened.
What I thought,

22
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:23,360
this is really fascinating that Forbes
has a mainstream article in Forbes,

23
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:26,120
did a comment wipe out ice age
megafauna,

24
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:28,790
and this is actually from just a couple
of weeks ago,

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,420
and then there was also this
interpretation that's fairly recent as

26
00:01:32,421 --> 00:01:34,970
well,
about one of the stone tablets,

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,880
uh,
one of the stone carvings rather on go

28
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,740
Beckley,
tempe and gram.

29
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,600
You would probably be the best to
describe that.

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,620
Yeah,
that was published in Mediterranean

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,760
Mediterranean archeology and archeometry
Peer Review Journal by a couple of

32
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,280
scientists from the University of
Edinburgh.

33
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,300
And they are proposing an interpretation
of the.

34
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,620
Go back to the TAPI imagery.
There's quite a lot of imagery on those

35
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,300
t shaped pillars,
particularly one pillar,

36
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:08,380
pillar 43 and enclosure d and uh,
their deduction,

37
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:10,120
what they take from their
interpretation.

38
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:11,560
Of course,
many will disagree with them.

39
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,020
Their interpretation is that those,
uh,

40
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:17,550
those images are speaking of the comet
impact there.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,070
Speaking of a comment that hit the earth
roughly 12,000,

42
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:22,660
900 years before our time,

43
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,190
and Randall,
this has been something that you have

44
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,920
been obsessed with for many,
many years now.

45
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,070
We've documented it and detailed in many
in many conversations that we've had on

46
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:36,770
the podcast.
Oh yes.

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,160
No,
I,

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,390
I can't say that I'm that familiar with
that article.

49
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:44,710
I haven't had a chance to get into it,
but this idea that the common impact is

50
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,080
the what,
what has caused the end of the ice age.

51
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,450
Well,
it's so complex,

52
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:54,280
but now what we do is we throw or some
type of an impact into the mix and it

53
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,860
seems to fill gaps that have pulled this
right up to you.

54
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,050
It seems to fill gaps that were

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,070
at this point still unexplained.
Um,

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,390
you know,
there's varying theories between some

57
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,580
extent of climate change in some extent,
of human predation that caused the

58
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,570
extinction.
And I've always felt like you can't

59
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,960
blame it on one or the other.
I think humans probably had a role but

60
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:22,960
only in the very final stages of the
extinction event.

61
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,900
And one of the,
um,

62
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,420
one of the scenarios would certainly
suggest that there were extreme climate

63
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,530
changes between the bought what's called
the Bowling Alley Rod,

64
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:38,890
which was the rather gradual warming at
the very end of the pleistocene.

65
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,930
Which was then followed by the younger
dryas,

66
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:44,620
which was the return to full glacial
cold and in the end of the younger

67
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:47,570
Dryas,
which is dated at about 11,600,

68
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,610
which is considered now to be the,
the boundary of the Holocene Post,

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,050
a younger dryas pre boreal,
it's called would be the beginning of

70
00:03:56,051 --> 00:04:01,051
the Holocene and it seems that most of
the extinctions did occur between

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,900
roughly 13,000 and 11,600 years ago.

72
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,240
Although the dating has a widespread on
it,

73
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:10,210
so you can't pinpoint it down to a
specific event.

74
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,830
But I've always felt like that there had
to be something we needed to look at

75
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,860
that triggered the extreme climate
changes that we do see at the end of the

76
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,790
ice age.
Um,

77
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,840
and to my opinion,
you can't,

78
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,740
um,
attribute that solely to milankovitch

79
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,350
theories,
which is basically the changing solar

80
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,540
terrestrial geometries because there are
too slow in what we see at the end of

81
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,490
the ice age were very rapid climate
changes.

82
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,740
And so one of the things that I think
has been missing has been the trigger.

83
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,350
Wallace brecker pointed out,
or a years ago that possibly a major

84
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:52,000
flood from the draining of Lake Agassi
caused an interruption of the thermo

85
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,570
Halian Circulation,
which is the basically the circulation

86
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:59,500
of the North Atlantic Ocean and that
this might have been what triggered the

87
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:03,430
younger dryas and then also contributed
to the mass extinction events,

88
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,460
but now I think that the dating of the
draining of Lake Agassi is too late for

89
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:13,930
that and was probably a ladder event
within the overall melting phenomena

90
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:18,931
that occurred between roughly 14,600 and
about 11,000 years ago.

91
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,920
Somewhere in there we have to fit that
mass extinction event.

92
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,900
And,
and I definitely have thought that

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,840
climate change was the dominant factor
in that,

94
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,570
but then what triggered the climate
change?

95
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:36,100
That always seemed to me to be something
that was not ever really explained.

96
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,670
Um,
the comment impact theory is very

97
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:43,120
controversial,
but the evidence has been steadily

98
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,910
mounting now for a decade,
including physical evidence,

99
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,370
renovate the core samples that show
nuclear glass.

100
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,750
I'm scattered out throughout Asia and
Europe that are roughly the same time

101
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,240
period when they do the core samples.
Yes,

102
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:59,690
it's most of it's dating to 12,000,
800 to 13,000 years ago.

103
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,090
These are called impact proxies.
Nano diamonds,

104
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,470
melt,
melt glass,

105
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,050
microsphere fuels.
These kinds of,

106
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
these kinds of things are associated
with impact,

107
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:12,390
not necessarily always caused by impact.
So this has been part of the reason for

108
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:14,940
the controversy,
but it's the abundance of all of these

109
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,900
at a particular level which leads a
large group of scientists to feel that

110
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:21,690
we have had a common impacting in the
partner.

111
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:25,550
That's the full assemblage of things
that it's difficult to explain

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,500
by processes without invoking some type
of a cosmic advance.

113
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,870
And it also corresponds with what you
believe is a period where earth travels

114
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:39,360
through a series of comments.
Well,

115
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,470
this

116
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,460
gets to,
to the,

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,470
to the ideas of the what would be called
the British Neo catastrophist Victor

118
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,440
Club and William Napier and,
and a number of others that have

119
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,240
theorized that from time to time earth
counters the debris from a large

120
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:57,000
disintegrating comet.
And there's an interesting,

121
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,480
uh,
William Napier addresses this and an

122
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,940
interesting article I can pull up here
pretty soon.

123
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,470
Um,
that possibly around 13,000 years ago,

124
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,030
earth may have encountered some of the
debris from a disintegrating comment,

125
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,510
which ultimately goes back to a fred
whipple who was one of the godfathers

126
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:16,510
of,
of commentary.

127
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,470
It was just coming on that for a second.
I mean specifically build,

128
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:23,800
build Api,
invicta clue bar are identifying the

129
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:27,790
remnants of this comment,
a width of the Taurid meteor stream,

130
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,640
which is familiar I think to everybody.
We pass through it twice a year.

131
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:32,980
We see meteoroids particularly at end of
October,

132
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:35,740
early November,
that Deb restream is still there.

133
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:38,460
It still contains,
according to their argument,

134
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,630
bits of the comment,
there are large objects in it like

135
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,180
commenting and key read,
nicheology auto and so on,

136
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:47,320
four or five kilometers in diameter.
And the suggestion is that the media

137
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,450
stream has got lots of small bits of
dust,

138
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,960
but it's got some larger stuff too.
And some of that stuff fell out of the

139
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:57,961
media stream 12,800 years ago and
impacted primarily the North American

140
00:07:58,301 --> 00:07:59,620
ice cap.
Now,

141
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,900
my goal,
when you listened to that podcast,

142
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:04,990
you had some questions.
You are professional skeptics.

143
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:08,080
So of course you were skeptical.
What are your thoughts about all that?

144
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,581
Uh,
yeah,

145
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:11,130
let me pull it back and it gave her a
bigger picture.

146
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:16,080
After the podcast I went and got the
book magicians of the Gods and uh,

147
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,230
and actually I listened to it on audio,
so it's,

148
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,760
I don't know,
like 16,

149
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:24,050
18 hours of,
of Graham reading with his,

150
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,370
his wonderful British accent,
which is,

151
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,560
you know,
for Americans that elevates the quality

152
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,780
of the argument by an order of
magnitude.

153
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,160
Yeah.
That's how they sell things in

154
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,800
infomercials over there.
And uh,

155
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,030
and Graham,
you're a good writer.

156
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,090
It's a very compelling story to you.
You're a great skeptic.

157
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,820
And,
and,

158
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:41,830
um,
you know,

159
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,850
and so I think a number of points about
in general,

160
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:50,820
the idea of alternative archeology,
which is really what we're talking about

161
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,940
here.
I prefer that to pseudo archeology

162
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,890
because that's a little bit of it is
supposed to be a little bit of an

163
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:56,310
insult.

164
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,290
So alternative archeology it.
So it's good to remember that.

165
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,400
So you have these guys on the podcast
for three or four hours and the audience

166
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,510
listening thinks,
yeah,

167
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,530
why not these guys get a fair hearing.
I mean it's like there's the mainstream

168
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,840
and then there's these guys,
right?

169
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,720
But,
but there isn't just these guys,

170
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,810
there's hundreds of alternative
archeological theories.

171
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,930
So which one gets the play,
which one gets attention,

172
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:22,890
which one doesn't?
And for a mainstream archeologist who's

173
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,800
busy in the field and trying to get
grants and so on,

174
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,880
they mostly just don't have the time to
sort through all these alternative

175
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:33,420
theories because this is just one.
And as we'll see in the next couple of

176
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,580
hours,
there's hundreds and hundreds of things

177
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:37,800
to be addressed.
So that's kind of what we do.

178
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,620
Um,
so just to rattle off a few of the lost

179
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,680
tribes of Israel,
who Connell colonize the Americas Mormon

180
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,470
archeology,
explanation of native Americans,

181
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,610
the Kensington Rune stones in Minnesota
that the vikings had come here.

182
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,580
The black Egyptian hypothesis.
When I was in graduate school,

183
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:57,060
this book called Black Athena was
published at the Egyptians were actually

184
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:02,061
black and that the sort of western white
male dominance of history had written

185
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,610
them out of the path.
So,

186
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,980
you know,
this was a whole alternative history,

187
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:09,930
alternative archeology,
piltdown man,

188
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:14,931
Thor Heyerdahl and his hypothesis that
the Polynesian islands were colonized by

189
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:19,230
South Americans who went west to east to
west.

190
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,400
That's since been debunked,
but that,

191
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:24,390
that's yet another one of these things.
South American archeology,

192
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,170
Omac statues seemed to have like African
features on them,

193
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:31,590
so maybe Africans went directly across
to South America.

194
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:32,910
So there's,
you know,

195
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,910
Eric Van Donican securize stitching now
most of these Graham a rejects and in

196
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,050
his book too,
to your credit.

197
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:42,610
So you're a good skeptic too.
Uh,

198
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,380
but,
but for,

199
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,980
for an outsider to an anthropologist
from Mars who steps into this thing,

200
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,270
cold doesn't know anything,
it's like,

201
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:50,550
well,
they're all alternative,

202
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,384
which is the right one.

203
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,980
And how do we know?
And so what was the way it works in

204
00:10:55,981 --> 00:11:00,150
sciences is the default position is the
skeptical position.

205
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,530
We assume your hypothesis is not true.
Not,

206
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,830
not just you,
anybody's hypothesis like the,

207
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,130
uh,
the clue,

208
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,880
nate napier hypothesis that was widely
published.

209
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:13,881
It was widely covered in mainstream
scientific journals and popular science

210
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:19,470
magazines like scientific American and
it has not fared that well over the last

211
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,490
decade or so.
It's still around,

212
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,300
it's still debated but that.
So you put it into the mainstream

213
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:27,690
through peer review journals and then
you go to conferences and you have it

214
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:30,390
out and,
and that's kind of where we end up with,

215
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:33,540
well this is what we think is probably
true for now.

216
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,240
And then all these other people out
here,

217
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,660
if they don't jump in and into the pool
where everybody is,

218
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,950
then there's no way for an outsider to
know whether these alternative things

219
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,690
have any validity or not other than they
make a compelling case in a popular

220
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:49,050
book.

221
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:49,883
Yes.
But,

222
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,750
but what are the mainstream scientists
think?

223
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,470
So,
and the problem is,

224
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,000
is that,
so a couple of specific things like when

225
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,710
I call patternicity,
the tendency to find meaningful patterns

226
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:00,670
in random noise.
You know,

227
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:02,770
the Virgin Mary on a grilled cheese
sandwich or whatever.

228
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,240
Those are fun examples,
but you know,

229
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,610
taking like a pictographs,
peck,

230
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,370
peck,
peck the glyphs and then comparing them

231
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,750
to constellations like,
you know,

232
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,640
here we have some constellations on your
roof here.

233
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,460
It,
it's easy in the mind's eye to find a

234
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,900
pattern.
The question is,

235
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,570
did those people really think 10,000
years ago,

236
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:25,240
5,000 years.
So this is a field called archeo

237
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:28,960
astronomy ed crop or the director of the
Griffith Observatory here in La.

238
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,260
This is what he does.
And sometimes the pattern,

239
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:35,080
he thinks the patterns mean something.
Sometimes they're totally random

240
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,250
and uh,
or you take something like the pyramids,

241
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:39,820
you know,
as,

242
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,170
as,
as Graham knows,

243
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:45,100
there's 100 theories about the pyramids
and there's the mainstream one.

244
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,610
And then there's all these other ones.
And this is why people like the director

245
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:51,880
there,
he just can't deal with them all,

246
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,280
you know.
So just as one example I used in my

247
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,260
book,
white people eat were things that,

248
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,990
you know,
one guy calculated that if you divide

249
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:01,360
the height of the pyramid to twice the
size of the base,

250
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:04,990
you get the number close to Pi.
And then he just sorta works all these

251
00:13:04,991 --> 00:13:07,240
different numbers,
so therefore it's cosmically

252
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:09,190
significant.
Well Richard Hoagland was like the best

253
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:13,810
example of what would find these
patterns in Mars and the like in claim

254
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:18,070
that like if you go from this rock to
half the distance and like why would you

255
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,630
do that?
Like that doesn't make any sense.

256
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,360
He would create these patterns.
Right?

257
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,660
And that's okay.
I mean all scientists look for patterns,

258
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:29,950
so like to take climate change,
either the earth is getting warmer,

259
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,840
it's not either it's human caused or
it's not.

260
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,120
There's a pattern in the data.
You can see the pattern.

261
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,920
The question is,
is the pattern real?

262
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,600
So this is why we call it,
we used the term climate consensus.

263
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,630
It's not a democracy,
it's not like we voted on it and decided

264
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:46,330
this is the truth.
It's that independently.

265
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,850
All these different scientists working
in different fields,

266
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,760
publishing in different journals come to
the same conclusion.

267
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,440
So we call this conciliate science or
convergence of evidence science that

268
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,630
it's not like these guys are meeting on
the weekends going,

269
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,250
boy,
we got to combat those.

270
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,410
You know,
those crazy right wingers with our data

271
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,990
there independently coming to these
conclusions.

272
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,720
So that lifts our confidence that,
yeah,

273
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,410
there's probably something to their
theory such that there's now so much

274
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:14,020
data converting to this,
you'd have to deconstruct every one of

275
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:16,360
those independent lines.
Um,

276
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,990
so then you have things like,
um,

277
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,050
what I call the problem of the residue
of anomalies in any field,

278
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,960
there are residue of anomalies we can't
explain.

279
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,860
So like [inaudible] for example,
a Ufo ologists me,

280
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:34,420
a skeptic agree that 90 to 95 percent of
all the Ufo sightings are explained by

281
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:38,260
natural phenomenon.
Venus swamp gas airplanes piece,

282
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:39,850
whatever.
They know that.

283
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,580
And so we're really only talking about
five percent.

284
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:47,460
Like how do you explain that one right
there in 1967 on June third,

285
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:50,230
and yet I don't know.
No one knows that one.

286
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,950
And then from there they build.
Well,

287
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,350
that's my case.
Then if you can explain that,

288
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,270
then I,
I have a kate.

289
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:56,901
No,
no,

290
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:57,591
no.
Well,

291
00:14:57,591 --> 00:15:00,530
that's very different than what we're
talking about here is how is that

292
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,890
relevant.
It's totally relevant because I think

293
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,980
almost all of your argument is based on
this residue of anomalies,

294
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,670
uh,
what we call the god of the gaps

295
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,830
argument.
If you scientists can't explain,

296
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:15,260
you know,
this particular rock right here or that

297
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:18,620
particular Petroglyph,
and I'm going to count that toward my

298
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,550
compilation of data to support my
hypothesis of a lost civilization.

299
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,150
No one is saying that the scientists can
explain it.

300
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,780
What would essentially,
particularly Randall with a series of

301
00:15:29,781 --> 00:15:34,781
images as shown is that what you have
here is something that can be explained

302
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,710
by rapid,
rapid melting of the ice caps and

303
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,700
Randall stepping on fuel.
I'll just go ahead and.

304
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,570
Well,
they do say it depends what you mean by

305
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,180
rapid glacial.
Damn.

306
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,250
That is our geologists will tell us that
moment that,

307
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,350
that breaks.
That's fairly rapid.

308
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,080
Back in [inaudible] 96,
it was a very popular book called,

309
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,310
uh,
Noah's flood.

310
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,560
This was a serious book by two
geologists that said it was the rapid

311
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:05,550
filling up at the black seat that
swamped over the civilizations living on

312
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:10,170
the edges of this and that.
That's where the wacky and flood story

313
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:13,290
comes from,
so it was widely debated and so on and

314
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,550
sense.
It hasn't fared that well,

315
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,400
but that's fairly rapid.
I mean we're talking over the course of

316
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:20,730
weeks or months or years to a geologist,
you know,

317
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,760
thousands of years is rapid,
so impact by a comment and it happens in

318
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,360
a couple of hours or a couple of days or
weeks versus a couple of months or

319
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,830
years.
What do we mean by rapid?

320
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,521
Okay,
well,

321
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:35,360
what are you saying then?
Okay,

322
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,800
so what are you saying about their
theories in particular?

323
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,140
Okay,
so the problem,

324
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:40,821
I think,
Graham,

325
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:44,910
that the deepest problem is,
is how much of your theory depends on

326
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,920
negative evidence.
That is,

327
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,580
I don't accept the mainstream
explanation for the pyramids,

328
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:52,380
the Sphinx,
the Machu Picchu,

329
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,810
whatever.
Let's not talk about that.

330
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,480
Let's just talk about this specific
subject because it's going to take a

331
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,820
long time just to cover yet.

332
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,500
Alright,
so my final point is,

333
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,590
is the falsifiability one.
That is,

334
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,610
what would it take to refute your
hypothesis?

335
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Like for me,
the answer would be like if go,

336
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,320
go,
Beckley,

337
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,650
Tepi turned out to be what you think it
might've been

338
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,620
the place where advanced ancient
civilization once inhabited,

339
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,860
or they used it.
Where are the metal tools?

340
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,730
Where are the writing the,
the examples of writing?

341
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,300
Perhaps the decision was made not to use
metal.

342
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:33,240
Perhaps a decision was made that arrows
had taken place that,

343
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,330
that in reinventing civilization,
we shouldn't perhaps go down quite the

344
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:42,040
same route as before.
Perhaps writing isn't always an advance.

345
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,840
Perhaps perhaps,
uh,

346
00:17:43,841 --> 00:17:47,320
an oral tradition which,
which records in memory which enhances

347
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:50,880
and uses the power of memory may be a
very effective way of,

348
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,470
of,
of dealing with information.

349
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,350
We regard writing as a,
as an advance,

350
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,890
and I can see lots of reasons why it
isn't advanced,

351
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,530
but if we put our self into the heads of
ancient peoples,

352
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,260
maybe it wasn't.
I mean there's a tradition from ancient

353
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:08,280
Egypt that the god,
both God of wisdom was the inventor of

354
00:18:08,281 --> 00:18:09,270
writing.
But we have,

355
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,010
we have a text in which he is.
He is questioned by a pharaoh who is,

356
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,990
who is saying,
well actually have you really done a

357
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:19,860
good thing by introducing writing
because then the words may roam around

358
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:22,980
the world without wise advice to,
to put them into,

359
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,310
into context and what will happen to
memory when people do so.

360
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,890
So there might be a choice not to not go
that way,

361
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,870
but,
but then what do you mean by advanced

362
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:35,220
when you say there used to be a lost
advanced civilization before 10,000

363
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:37,830
years ago,
but let's just wait for a second because

364
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:42,750
what we know for a fact is that the
carbon dating in all the area around

365
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,080
Beckley,
Tapi is somewhere around 12,000 years.

366
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,450
Is that correct?
Eleven thousand 600 years ago because

367
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,300
the earliest they found so far,
but a great deal of Rebecca Tapi is

368
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,440
still underground.
Right?

369
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:55,680
So it,
at least what we know is someone built

370
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,860
some pretty impressive structures
11,000,

371
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:02,700
600 years ago,
7,000 years before stone when that story

372
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:05,430
broke.
This is long before you came along with

373
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:06,320
your book.
Uh,

374
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,320
it was controversial in the sense that
we thought hunter gatherers could not do

375
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:14,010
something like this because to do that
you need a large population with a

376
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:16,140
division of labor and so forth.

377
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,860
And so what the response to
archeologists was,

378
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,300
well,
I guess we were wrong about hunter

379
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:23,400
gatherers.
Maybe they can do more stuff than we

380
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,880
gave them credit for.
So why is that not a reasonable

381
00:19:26,881 --> 00:19:29,790
hypothesis versus they were,
it was actually a band,

382
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,740
but we mean something completely
different by advanced,

383
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:34,740
not rioting and metal and technology.
We mean,

384
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,330
I don't know what you mean.
What do you mean?

385
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,220
Well,
I mean we have,

386
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,730
we have a body of archeology which goes
on for decades,

387
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,960
which is saying that a megalithic sites,
for example,

388
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
giganteum in Malta or Hydra,
Hydra megalithic sites a date to no

389
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:55,730
older than five and a half to 6,000
years old gig.

390
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,970
Tia would push it close to 6,000 years
old and they're no oldest sites than

391
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:03,870
that.
And therefore the Megalithic site is

392
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,470
associated with a certain stage of
Neolithic development.

393
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,310
Then along comes go,
Beckley Tepi 7,000 years older than

394
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,240
stonehenge.

395
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,090
Incredibly sophisticated site,
very large scale.

396
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,580
I mean Klaus Schmidt,
sadly he's passed away.

397
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:20,010
I spent three days working the site with
him.

398
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,110
He was very generous to me.
He showed me a lot.

399
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:26,100
He talked to me a lot and he said
basically 50 times as much as they've

400
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:30,660
already excavated is still is still
under the ground that there's hundreds

401
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,330
and hundreds of giant stone pillars that
they've identified with ground

402
00:20:33,331 --> 00:20:36,210
penetrating radar.
He's not even sure if they're ever,

403
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,620
if they're ever going to excavate them,
but by all accounts we are looking.

404
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:42,810
If we take what still under the ground
into account,

405
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:46,890
we're looking at the largest megalithic
site that's ever been created on earth

406
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,160
and it pops up

407
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,480
11,600 years ago with no obvious
background to it.

408
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,020
It just comes out of nowhere.
No,

409
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,290
to me,
that's rather well that we know of,

410
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,290
but to me that says that's immediately a
rather puzzling and interesting

411
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,970
situation and I would be remiss as as an
author and an inquire into these matters

412
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:07,300
if I didn't take great interest in that.
The sudden appearance,

413
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,720
7,000 years before Stonehenge,
you have a megalithic site that dwarfs

414
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:11,501
stonehenge.
To me,

415
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:13,810
that's a mystery and it's really worth
inquiring into.

416
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,720
We love to put it into

417
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,090
perspective.
That's more than 2000 years older than

418
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:22,380
what we now consider to be the building
of the Great Pyramid of Giza in

419
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:27,710
comparison to us to then so between our
time now in 2017 in the construction,

420
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,270
the great pyramid,
you're talking about 2000 years earlier

421
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:35,271
than that and that is unbelievable when
you're talking about 7,000 years before

422
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:37,590
what we thought people were doing.
Okay,

423
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:42,591
but my point was that instead of before
we go down the road of constructing a

424
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,540
lost civilization that was super
advanced,

425
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,040
but different from our idea of advance,
why not just attribute to these fully

426
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,330
modern hunter gatherers who had the same
size brains we have and so on that they

427
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:58,530
were able to figure out and do this.
We just under estimated their ability.

428
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,560
So why did archeologists tell us for so
long?

429
00:22:00,561 --> 00:22:03,320
Hunter gatherers couldn't do it,
and we needed agricultural populations

430
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:05,910
that could generate surpluses that could
pay for the specialist

431
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,620
theory,
but that was it.

432
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,760
So now with archeologists are saying,
well,

433
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,500
I guess we were wrong about hunter
gatherers.

434
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,320
Well,
they might be wrong about hunter

435
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,900
gatherers or there might be another
civilization that they had not

436
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:20,040
discovered that has been unearthed by
the doctor.

437
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,950
Lost civilizations are not such an
extraordinary idea.

438
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:27,320
I mean,
nobody knew that the Indus Valley

439
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:31,250
civilization existed at all until some
railway work was done around Ninja

440
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,240
Teodoro in 1923.
Suddenly a whole civilization pops up

441
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:37,490
out of the woodwork.
There's just never been taken into

442
00:22:37,491 --> 00:22:39,140
account before.
The 19 twenties.

443
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,090
We still can't read it.
Script,

444
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,210
you know,
the.

445
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,050
The idea that we,
that we come across that another turn of

446
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:47,810
the spade reveals information that
causes us to reconsider.

447
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,750
Not just was it hunter gatherers or
agriculturalist,

448
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:53,250
but perhaps something bigger than this
is involved.

449
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,570
That's not,
that's not such an extraordinary idea.

450
00:22:56,571 --> 00:22:59,120
I get it that mainstream archeology
doesn't want to go there,

451
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,240
but that's my job to go.

452
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,670
I don't think that that's correct.
They would be happy to go there if

453
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:06,740
there's evidence for it by what you just
said.

454
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:09,590
They now fully accept the Indus Valley
civilizations.

455
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,570
How did that happen?
If they were dogmatically?

456
00:23:11,571 --> 00:23:13,140
Closed minded and

457
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,040
I don't say that they were dogmatically.
Closed minded about that.

458
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:18,620
The evidence,
the massive amount of evidence that came

459
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:21,260
up with the discovery of Mahindra,
Daro,

460
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:24,230
harappa dollar Veera and other and other
such sides.

461
00:23:24,231 --> 00:23:27,440
It's very difficult.
You have to be completely stupid to say

462
00:23:27,441 --> 00:23:30,570
that that's not a civilization.
Got Beckley tap is a bit more nuanced.

463
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,520
You know,
we have stone,

464
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,220
we have stone circles.
We have some interesting astronomical

465
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:36,230
alignment.
Is the world's first perfectly north

466
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:38,000
south allied building maybe?
No,

467
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:38,691
definitely.
Again,

468
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:41,030
that's a patternicity thing.
Deciding Klaus Schmidt,

469
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,321
well,
that's all right,

470
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:44,810
but any of us who read back into

471
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,220
10,000 years ago what we're thinking
that they might have been thinking,

472
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:52,220
that's always a dangerous for anybody,
not just you all.

473
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:54,680
That's a good point.
Who Klaus Schmidt classmate was the

474
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:56,510
original excavator Africa,
basically tapping.

475
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,760
He was the head of the German
archeological institute,

476
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,370
dig,
add to go back to tempe.

477
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,770
He kindly spent three days showing me,
uh,

478
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,320
uh,
around the site and really nobody's

479
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,420
disputing the astronomical alignment,
so I've got back to the me.

480
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,150
They weren't particularly interesting to
Klaus Schmidt,

481
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:13,160
but they're there.
And what is the alignment like?

482
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:16,400
How is it established when you have a
perfectly north side,

483
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,500
north,
south aligned structure,

484
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,390
perfectly north,
south to true north,

485
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,940
not magnetic north.
Then you are dealing with astronomy by

486
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:25,880
definition and there are other
alignments of the certain struggles as

487
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,880
established today or with the procession
of the equinox.

488
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,300
It's the rotation axis of our planet.

489
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,310
Okay,
so it to this day,

490
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:37,520
it points exactly in the same place
where it was pointing to the true north,

491
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,340
but back to the know they don't want to
go.

492
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,480
Sure.
They want to go there.

493
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,980
They would happy,
be happy to go there.

494
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,580
Case in point,
two weeks ago in the journal Nature,

495
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,570
the most prestigious scientific journal
in the world,

496
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,970
there was published an article that
humans are maybe neanderthals lived in

497
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:57,971
San Diego area 130,000 years ago.
This is an order of magnitude older than

498
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:01,640
the clovis date.
This was the mastodon bones.

499
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:05,030
They found that balance yet.
So here's an example of how.

500
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,520
Okay,
so clearly there's not some conspiracy

501
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:11,420
to keep alternative people are fringe or
or radical theories out.

502
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,600
It was published in peer reviewed the
most prestigious journal in the world.

503
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,500
There it is.
Time bad.

504
00:25:15,501 --> 00:25:17,210
What happened?
Well,

505
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,970
it hasn't been a massive reaction to
that and lots of.

506
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,550
Lots of scathing remarks,
either academics,

507
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,980
but that's normal.
That's how science works.

508
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,200
You get,
you get pushed back.

509
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,350
It's.
You got to have a thick skin.

510
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,180
It's just the way it goes.
Got to have a thick skin,

511
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,090
that's for sure,
but maybe sometimes your skin is so

512
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,110
thick that you can't sense anything
around.

513
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,210
Of course we don't want that either.
So what do you think is going on when

514
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:41,060
you look at something like directly,
Beckley tappy that's covered,

515
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,800
covered up purposefully,
right?

516
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,960
Deliberately buried.
Again,

517
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,280
I say Klaus Schmidt,
he,

518
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,530
he's the authority on this.
He's the excavator.

519
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:53,150
He absolutely adamantly insisted that
that site was deliberately buried and

520
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,660
finally covered with a hill,
which is what got badly tappy means in

521
00:25:56,661 --> 00:25:58,100
the Turkish language.
Potbellied hill.

522
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,810
Yep.
And you're talking about something,

523
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:03,050
give me the perspective of how large
they believe it is currently as of

524
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,040
current.

525
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,400
What's excavated at the moment is on a
scale of Stonehenge,

526
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:11,050
what's under the ground?
Maybe as much as 50 times larger Jesus,

527
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:13,210
but.
But it got back the template there.

528
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,500
No one lived there.
There's no tools.

529
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,281
There's no.
Well,

530
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:20,090
you're talking about $12,000,
but if it's buried,

531
00:26:20,091 --> 00:26:21,410
it should be.
It should be pottery.

532
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:22,730
There's no pottery,
no writing,

533
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:25,340
no articles of clothing.
No one lived there when you're saying

534
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:27,020
nobody lived there,
so why should they have poetry?

535
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:29,990
Why should pottery beat in the field?
But why were they glad they go along and

536
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:34,410
breaks and pots and stick it in the
artificial their trash when they see

537
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,680
something that would indicate it's
different.

538
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,890
A different kinds of people than what
we're used to seeing in the

539
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:43,260
archaeological record can alert rubbish
that they poured in.

540
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:45,720
It's just stones in earth buckets of it.
In other words,

541
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,890
grant for you to gain support for your
theory amongst mainstream

542
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:52,650
archaeologists,
they want to see positive evidence to

543
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:53,760
overturn the old theory.

544
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,560
In other words,
the burden of proof is on the person

545
00:26:55,561 --> 00:26:58,500
challenging the mainstream in every
field,

546
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,390
but isn't there some proof that the
mainstream idea of these hunters and

547
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:08,391
gatherers never had anything in what the
theory was that would indicate these

548
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:11,910
people were capable of building
something you remotely the size of

549
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,020
Beckley tend?
To me,

550
00:27:13,021 --> 00:27:18,021
that's the stunning beauty of this find.
It overturns ideas of primitive hunter

551
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:19,800
gatherers.
It could not do this.

552
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,190
Apparently they can.
That's one.

553
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,840
Yeah,
assessor.

554
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,340
Right?
So this.

555
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,450
I call this somebody else.
The bigotry of low expectations.

556
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:29,040
You know,
it's like we had this kind of low

557
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:32,490
expectations for these hunter gatherers.
Maybe we should jettison that idea.

558
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,450
And in my own other field of the history
of religion,

559
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,900
it also threw that off because this
apparently was a kind of a spiritual

560
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,250
religious.
That's the wrong word.

561
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:41,930
They would have used.

562
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,210
Actually nobody can.
Nobody can know that that's right.

563
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:45,720
So,
but if it was,

564
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,090
this is the big national geographic
article,

565
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,870
emphasize that maybe this is the very
first religious spiritual temple ever

566
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:54,570
built because they didn't live there.
So they went there for a reason.

567
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:59,571
It also possible that this is signs that
civilization was more advanced 12,000

568
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,630
years ago.
Then we thought,

569
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,920
okay,
more advanced.

570
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,870
What again?
What do we mean by talking about the

571
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,760
ability to construct and amazing
structural.

572
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,850
How big was it?
Like how tall were these?

573
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,070
Some of them are 20 feet tool.
Yeah.

574
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:12,750
But some of them are smaller with,
with,

575
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:14,860
with uh,
astronomical alignments clashed.

576
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:18,780
Smith called it a center of innovation.
He was intrigued by the way that

577
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,590
agriculture emerges around go Beckley
Tepi at the same time that go back to

578
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,510
the tempe is created.
I mean,

579
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:26,910
he went on record with me.

580
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,550
Perhaps he's not right,
but he went on record with me as saying

581
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:33,960
that was the first agriculture.
These were the people who invented

582
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:35,310
agriculture.
Now to me,

583
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,690
the notion that a group of hunter
gatherers wake up one morning and invent

584
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,080
megalithic architecture,
the world's largest megalithic site,

585
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,580
and at the same moment invent
agriculture stretches credulity a bit.

586
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,870
And I think I would prefer to propose,
and I have proposed that what we're

587
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:55,320
looking at is evidence of some kind of
transfer of technology that people came

588
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:59,130
into that area who had other knowledge,
but that was applied and perhaps they

589
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,680
mobilize the local population around
this site.

590
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:04,410
Perhaps that's precisely why we see
agriculture developing there.

591
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,930
So perhaps that's the skill that's being
passed on,

592
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,210
but I don't see anything particularly.
Okay.

593
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,510
That stone work is spectacular,
but that's not any more advanced than a

594
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:19,530
few centuries millennium afterwards when
you're talking about something 20 feet

595
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,100
of stone that were hunter gatherers,
couple hundred people can move multi ton

596
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,010
stones.

597
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,500
There's no mystery.
And moving the stones.

598
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,300
I started moving 20 ton stones in
Indonesia today.

599
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,010
That culture still exists.
We.

600
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:34,950
You also know that the carving on the
outside is extremely complex.

601
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:36,990
It's three dimensional carving.
Okay.

602
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:38,870
But you know,
that means that loud.

603
00:29:38,871 --> 00:29:41,650
Do you know what that means?
That lascaux at 30,000 ago has

604
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:45,010
magnificent cave paintings with three
dimension that animals.

605
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,060
But that's painting,
you know,

606
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:47,860
that they.
Hold on a second.

607
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,750
Do you know what I'm saying?
When I say three dimensional carvings

608
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:53,740
and like the Venus de Milo carvings were
on the outside,

609
00:29:53,741 --> 00:29:55,390
meaning they didn't carve them into the
rock,

610
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:59,440
they carved away the rock around them,
which is pretty sophisticated stuff for

611
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:04,441
hunter gatherers and they're doing this
on these 20 foot tall stone columns.

612
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,980
I mean,
it's pretty impressive stuff.

613
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,843
Okay,
but there,

614
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,280
the assumption is that they couldn't
have figured this out.

615
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,280
We know from modern societies where,
say Australian aborigines in one

616
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:17,920
generation,
they go from stone tools to fly in

617
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:21,040
airplanes.
The brains are quite capable of doing

618
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,730
these amazing things.
Stones,

619
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,980
airplanes.
Without somebody introducing them to

620
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:27,730
airplanes.
Yeah.

621
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,440
You,
you're actually making his argument for

622
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:29,621
them.
No,

623
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:33,340
no.
It's not that much of a reach to carve

624
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,860
stone.
People have been carving stones,

625
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:40,540
but the tire archeological opinion on
megalithic sites for decades before this

626
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:43,180
was precisely that.
It was beyond their ability to attend

627
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,820
and now that mainstream has changed.
It's okay,

628
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,380
but let's start.
At the very least,

629
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:49,840
they will shift.
Let's pause for a moment.

630
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,150
Let's pause for a moment.
So for sure.

631
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:55,260
We all agree human beings made this.
Yes,

632
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,280
not even so the aliens,
so the argument is not whether or not

633
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,790
aliens made it.
The argument is whether or not humans

634
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:06,160
made it,
that we're sophisticated.

635
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,670
Well,
there clearly sophisticated enough to

636
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:14,671
make this incredible structure that is
is some sign of some sort of

637
00:31:16,181 --> 00:31:18,130
civilization.
I believe so,

638
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,150
yeah,
it is.

639
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:22,840
It's a gigantic structure.
I agree with grand that we again,

640
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,800
undersold who these people were.
My friend jared diamond goes to Papa New

641
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,260
Guinea.
He talks at the opening chapter of guns,

642
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:32,530
germs and steel.
How smart these people are that live out

643
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:34,690
there in nature and what it takes to
survive.

644
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,690
Sure.
He wouldn't last an hour from La.

645
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,260
He wouldn't last an hour with his pop
into Gideon friends out there in the

646
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,820
wild because he doesn't know how to
survive and they've been passing down

647
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:48,400
the information for generation after
generation.

648
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,510
Very smart.
Okay,

649
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:53,040
so it's not a problem of intelligence.
And is there a.

650
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
okay.
So here's the other thing we don't know

651
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,100
is that there might be lots more of
these sites and where there's the jar I

652
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:00,940
visited,
one of them are rotten Teppei you've

653
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:02,680
got,
you've got the t shaped pillows sticking

654
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:04,510
out the side of a hill and the farmers
back yard.

655
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,500
I mean,
I think we're actually at the beginning

656
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,000
of opening up this inquiry.
Not at the end of it,

657
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,780
but then it'd be before you.
Okay.

658
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,970
Why not just say we don't know.
This is a spectacular mystery and leave

659
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:16,570
it at that,
right?

660
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,710
Why write a book we're gonna.
Fill in all the gaps on the mainstream

661
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:22,090
side.
Won't speculate.

662
00:32:22,091 --> 00:32:24,400
I'm willing to explore.
I don't claim to be an archeologist.

663
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,320
I'm not a scientist.
I'm an author.

664
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:29,470
It's my job to offer it a little
tentative point of view and to offer a

665
00:32:29,471 --> 00:32:31,480
coherently argued alternative point of
view.

666
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:35,170
And I must say go back.
He strikes me as a gigantic fucking

667
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:40,171
mystery and a mystery that is worthy of
exploration from

668
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,430
a point of view that may not satisfy you
a well,

669
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,960
it doesn't.
You don't have to satisfy me,

670
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:47,300
you and your,
you and your colleagues and I don't,

671
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,530
I don't,
I certainly don't have to satisfy you or

672
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:50,690
them.
That's not my project.

673
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:55,040
Your opening chapter with Schmidt.
I thought I really love the kind of

674
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:58,180
conversational style you had with
Schmidt in the book where he's

675
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,520
dialoguing,
where she goes,

676
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,860
look at this and then he says,
but,

677
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,170
but,
but wait,

678
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,260
what's that again?
Now he's a little bit like Columbia,

679
00:33:05,261 --> 00:33:05,710
like,
wait,

680
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:06,780
wait.
I have just one more quick.

681
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,370
Just one more question.
And you know that ministry kind of

682
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,320
thickens.
That's perfectly okay.

683
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:13,600
That's great.
I mean that's what science is all about

684
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:16,690
is uncovering mysteries that we then
have to figure out.

685
00:33:16,691 --> 00:33:19,840
So there's always more mysteries,
but that doesn't mean that's not

686
00:33:19,841 --> 00:33:22,390
positive evidence in favor of a
particular theory,

687
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:26,370
like a lost civilization.
It's just we can't explain this full

688
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,260
stop.
Yeah,

689
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,180
we certainly can't explain it.
And you can explain it by saying that we

690
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:33,130
underestimated hunter and gatherers
either.

691
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,481
Well,
why not?

692
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:35,314
We know they made it.

693
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,120
Whatever you want to call them.
Well,

694
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:38,530
we know humans made it.
That's right.

695
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,360
We know humans made then whenever you
want to cry,

696
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:44,470
but why do they believe that people were
only hunters and gatherers 12,000 years

697
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:45,830
ago?
It's because they didn't have any

698
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,930
evidence.
The contract.

699
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,030
This is evidence to the contrary.
I agree.

700
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,510
So you agree that there weren't
harboring hunter and gatherers?

701
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,600
Okay.
But there's several stages in between

702
00:33:55,601 --> 00:34:00,020
just 12 people living out in the jungle
by themselves versus us.

703
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,570
You know,
there's a whole bunch of different.

704
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,070
I would say that go Beckley.
Tapi is a gigantic stage.

705
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,840
While we don't.
They didn't live there,

706
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:10,170
so we have to figure out what,
where,

707
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:13,210
where were they living in,
what was there so that that has to be

708
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:13,710
excavated.

709
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,780
Well,
the only excavated a 10 percent.

710
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:19,150
Meanwhile what you're saying is that we
shouldn't speculate at all because I

711
00:34:19,151 --> 00:34:20,940
mean mainstream archeology,
speculating,

712
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,620
speculating when saying it's definitely
was hunter gatherers who did this.

713
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:26,700
That's also a speculation.

714
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,943
Okay.
But not.

715
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:33,990
They may be more than hunter gatherers.
They may have been partially settled.

716
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:35,640
There's,
you can have any kind of number of

717
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:36,040
states,

718
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,940
but what you can't apparently have is
the possibility of a transfer of

719
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:41,880
technology from people who are really
masters of that technology already when

720
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:43,440
they came in,
but where are these people?

721
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:47,310
Whereas when you're dealing with 12,000
years ago,

722
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,920
now let's find their homes.
I don't know.

723
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:53,160
I don't know that that Holmes matter.
Would their homes even survive after

724
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:55,080
$12,000?
I'm not sure

725
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,710
there's something.
Well,

726
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,980
what trash and tools we've got.
Go back to the top.

727
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:04,620
It confronts us.
It challenges the mainstream model.

728
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,030
I think it's reasonable to consider the
possibility that there was something

729
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:11,640
more than just hunter gatherer is
involved here in creating this

730
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:14,400
extraordinary place and that's all I've
done.

731
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,650
It seems to me that to say hunter
gatherers could build this.

732
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,590
I'm not.
I wouldn't be opposed to the idea that

733
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,540
they're hunting and gathering,
but it does certainly imply a lot of

734
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,800
leisure time.
Yes,

735
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,240
a lot of leisure time.
Well,

736
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,410
we know 100 yet.
Oh,

737
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:31,101
sorry.
It's okay.

738
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,480
It was like,
well,

739
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,730
again,
if we place this back,

740
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:38,580
particularly within that climate zone at
11,006

741
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,830
to 12,000,
13,000 years ago,

742
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:44,490
whatever it turns out to be,
we're dealing with an extremely

743
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,370
demanding and challenging climate,
which,

744
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,930
which wouldn't necessarily,
to my mind be conducive to the emergence

745
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:56,931
of a settled culture that would be
capable of undertaking a project on this

746
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:59,910
scale.
And as somebody who's built a lot of

747
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,880
things and move quite a few heavyweights
in my time,

748
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,300
um,
I find it the idea sort of perplexing to

749
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,750
me that they would be what I,
what I would have to ask is what is

750
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,360
their motive?
What is their motive for undertaking a

751
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:19,680
project on this scale?
Because it's an enormous project and to

752
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:24,681
move a 20 ton block of stone is really a
challenging task to undertake today,

753
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,360
today.
Well without,

754
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,730
without,
you know,

755
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,461
uh,
you know,

756
00:36:29,461 --> 00:36:31,230
the infrastructure of,
of,

757
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:36,290
of large machines and so forth.
But to do it by hand,

758
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,180
it would be an enormous undertaking.

759
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,200
And,
and I,

760
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:42,480
you know,
to me it's like when are they having

761
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:46,320
time to hunt and gather when you're
engaged in a project of this scale,

762
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,770
but we know hunter gatherers have way
more free time than modern society

763
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:51,510
people do.
That's the one thing we've learned is

764
00:36:51,511 --> 00:36:53,280
that it's a pretty good way to make a
living.

765
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:55,350
Actually,
they have a better varied diet than we

766
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:56,390
have.
This is the,

767
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,570
you know,
the Neanderthal Diet,

768
00:36:57,571 --> 00:36:59,670
right?
They have a better varied diet and a lot

769
00:36:59,671 --> 00:37:00,810
more free time.
Yeah,

770
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:04,590
but that's a lot less stress.
We knew that all along about hunter

771
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,110
gatherer is when we were saying they
couldn't build megalithic sites,

772
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,560
but we're,
we're making time to do it where the

773
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:15,561
environment is undergoing rapid changes
to which adaptations would be extremely

774
00:37:16,051 --> 00:37:19,830
challenging and we know those changes
are going on all over the planet.

775
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:22,050
We know that sea levels are rising
rapidly,

776
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:25,120
rising over a period of a few thousand
years from,

777
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,070
from a c stand low of about 400 feet up
to the present level.

778
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,810
We also know that that by Otis,
we're shifting dramatically all over the

779
00:37:33,811 --> 00:37:34,430
planet.
The,

780
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:36,060
the,
the effects of the younger Dryas,

781
00:37:36,061 --> 00:37:40,590
we're global pretty much that is I think
the emerging consensus now that that

782
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,550
both hemispheres north and south were
being affected by the climate changes or

783
00:37:44,551 --> 00:37:47,940
the younger dryas.
So what we're doing is replacing this,

784
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,720
this phenomenon of this,
this project within this context of

785
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:54,990
these extremely challenging times in
which,

786
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,020
you know,
adaptation to the environmental changes

787
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,760
could easily be the,
the all consuming challenge of the

788
00:38:02,761 --> 00:38:06,550
Times.
I'm just finding it difficult to imagine

789
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:11,010
a disconnect too,
to see this disconnect between a project

790
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:16,011
of this magnitude and the motive for
doing it during a time when obviously

791
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:22,581
the environment could be posing serious
constraints upon people's ability to

792
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:26,970
function in that random.
We don't even know the motives of the

793
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,340
Easter islanders and no,
we don't raise these huge state,

794
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,870
but we know they did it,
but as debt become a central question,

795
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:35,950
know what,
something to have motivated,

796
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,940
but then let's get back to tobacco.
Tempe,

797
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,420
so we.
So let's just be real clear.

798
00:38:40,421 --> 00:38:43,510
We know that we're humans.
We know that it's at least 12,000 years

799
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:46,360
old and we know that the real dispute
here,

800
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:48,880
the real question is,
did these people have structures and did

801
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:51,700
they have agriculture?
We know that they were human beings.

802
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,440
They were essentially modern human
beings,

803
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:58,020
so or the hunter gatherers or did they
have structures in they didn't have

804
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,650
structures and they didn't have
agriculture.

805
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,160
I'm happy they did.
So the fact that they were able to build

806
00:39:03,161 --> 00:39:07,600
something so monumental.
What kind of a leap is it at all to

807
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:10,780
think that these people could figure out
how to plant food and figure out how to

808
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:11,614
make a house?

809
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,590
Well,
I mean,

810
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:16,510
again,
if you look back 30,000 years,

811
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:19,720
40,000 years to these cave paintings,
these are pretty sophisticated,

812
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,190
beautiful.
They are clearly.

813
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,550
They had abstract reasoning.
They could think from the concrete to

814
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:27,700
the abstract and so on.
It's not a big reach to go from that to

815
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,170
moving stones around.

816
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,560
Let's say there's a big difference
between painting and engraving on cave

817
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:37,561
walls and created
the largest megalithic site that's ever

818
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:41,530
been built on earth.
I think there's a huge difference

819
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:42,311
between those two.
I mean,

820
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:46,990
nobody would compare the construction
effort on on stonehenge or began tia

821
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,760
with cave paintings.
I agree with you.

822
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:52,090
The cave paintings are magnificent.
I've had the privilege to visit many of

823
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:54,910
the painted cave stunning work and as
Picasso said,

824
00:39:54,911 --> 00:39:57,370
when he came out of Alaska,
we have invented nothing.

825
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,250
I mean they were.
The staff was that modern human mind,

826
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,850
symbolic mind at work there,
but this is another matter.

827
00:40:03,851 --> 00:40:08,080
This is a large scale construction
project that's going on and it's not

828
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:09,940
just a construction person has like
huts.

829
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,350
It's hundreds and hundreds of very,
very large megalithic pillars which have

830
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:15,880
to be mobilized,
brought to the place,

831
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,270
you know,
organizing a workforce in order to do

832
00:40:19,271 --> 00:40:21,790
that.
Even that requires preparation and time

833
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:24,100
and learning and practice.
It's not something that you wake up one

834
00:40:24,101 --> 00:40:27,190
morning and just can do overnight.
You think that the paintings are more

835
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:28,180
impressive than go back?

836
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,060
Yeah.
Or at least comparable.

837
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,020
Yeah.
I think that's absolutely ridiculous to

838
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:35,720
convey

839
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,310
three dimensionality on a two d plane
that because Oh man.

840
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:41,120
It's like,
wow,

841
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,930
that's a crow.

842
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:45,020
It's like developing perspective and to
use the natural shape,

843
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,830
but it's not create a three dimensional
perspective.

844
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:51,770
Look is that's pretty abstract.
Comparing apples and pears.

845
00:40:51,771 --> 00:40:56,660
It's not a construction project,
but I don't think it's even remotely.

846
00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,040
What I'm saying is that it doesn't take
a huge leap of imagination to think

847
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,780
these people were pretty smart.
They were smart.

848
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,700
We know what they are smart.
Just because of the fact that those

849
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:07,790
construction projects were done by who?
By whoever.

850
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,790
We know that they were smart.
Whoever built go Beckley tap who was

851
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:13,400
clearly intelligent.
Whoever made those three d carvings,

852
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,910
clearly they were intelligent,
but to think that someone drawing on

853
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:21,911
cave paintings is more impressive.
20 foot stone columns with three

854
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:26,930
dimensional carvings on them have a lot
of animals that weren't even native to

855
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:30,940
the to the region.
That's not the case because they could

856
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:33,960
have been the Danimals,
but my point

857
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,020
though is that these paintings are like
say 30,

858
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:39,440
40,000 years old.
Took it back to the top so there's tens

859
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,180
of thousands of years to develop more
that we were very likely to find more

860
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:48,710
archaeological site up til now.
We haven't found that we haven't.

861
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,350
We haven't found all of that
intermediate material which is see if I,

862
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,320
if I could actually see that
intermediate material between the upper,

863
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,400
upper Paleolithic cave art and go back
to the top.

864
00:41:58,401 --> 00:42:01,640
If I could see the gradual evolution and
development of skills,

865
00:42:01,641 --> 00:42:04,850
I wouldn't need to invoke a lost
civilization.

866
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:07,910
The survivors of a lost civilization
who've mastered those skills elsewhere

867
00:42:07,911 --> 00:42:09,600
to come in and teach those skills that
go badly,

868
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,990
Tevye,
but it still looks to me like a transfer

869
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:15,110
of technology,
unless you can show me that evolutionary

870
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:19,520
process whereby I can understand how
this group of hunter gatherers became

871
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:22,730
equipped to create this giant side where
they practiced,

872
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:24,410
where they learned the skill to move the
stones,

873
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,500
to organize the workforce to feed and
water the workforce in a rather dry

874
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:28,040
place.

875
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,530
All of that is actually quite a
logistical challenge.

876
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,200
Yup.
And obviously somebody met it somehow.

877
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,590
Some humans.
Yeah.

878
00:42:34,591 --> 00:42:36,650
So the real question is,
do they have structures,

879
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,950
did they have agriculture,
did they have some sort of a community

880
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:41,870
where they lived on an established
location?

881
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:44,000
I would,
I would imagine so would that would push

882
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:47,990
back the time where we thought that
there was a civilization that would push

883
00:42:47,991 --> 00:42:52,991
them back into a realm of at least stead
stepping out of the hunter gatherer

884
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,730
stage.
Now you're married as you show in your

885
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:57,440
book.
He did not go as far as you.

886
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,820
You're certainly not,
but he admitted it to mystery.

887
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:01,520
Okay.
Why?

888
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,910
That would be the scientific approach.
I don't know what it is.

889
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:06,770
Great mystery.
Let's just wait and see.

890
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,890
Versus a,
I'm going to populate a lot of

891
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,440
civilization.
Nothing wrong with that grant.

892
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,740
It's a free country.

893
00:43:13,110 --> 00:43:15,890
And scientists do this all the time as,
as you've mentioned,

894
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,250
there's a rather humorous thing which I
have to say actually,

895
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,440
I might even ask Jamie to pull up the,
um,

896
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,670
the,
a couple of images of fingerprints of

897
00:43:25,671 --> 00:43:27,980
the gods.
That's the book I'm best known for.

898
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,780
Uh,
and when I,

899
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,480
uh,
published fingerprints of the Gods in

900
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,890
1995,
essentially I was saying civilization is

901
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:41,891
much older and much more mysterious than
we thought and I was ridiculed for

902
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,510
proposing that 2013,
one of the magazines that ridiculed me,

903
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,470
New Scientist magazine in Britain,
publishers as a cover story picture of

904
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:55,820
go back to Tempe and the headline
civilization is much older and much more

905
00:43:55,821 --> 00:43:58,220
mysterious than we thought.
Okay,

906
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,320
fair enough.
And,

907
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,520
and scientists do do this.
I mean,

908
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:06,080
I've followed paleoanthropology for my
whole adult life and one of the big

909
00:44:06,081 --> 00:44:09,950
mysteries is how did we get a big brain?
How do we get to abstract reasoning

910
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,170
from,
from say what chimps can do.

911
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,310
No one knows the doubling of the human
brain size over a period of 2 million

912
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:20,120
years because no one knows every couple
of years there's a new book out.

913
00:44:20,121 --> 00:44:23,590
It's climate change.
It was the throwing arm cooking,

914
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,270
cooking meat.
Meat is another big one.

915
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:27,300
A Harvard professor meet.
Okay.

916
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,960
And these books come and go and some of
them have legs,

917
00:44:29,961 --> 00:44:32,070
some of them don't.
And it's just

918
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,080
the way it goes.
And it rears Terence Mckenna is pretty

919
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:35,370
obvious.
It was psychedelics.

920
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:36,360
Yeah,
that's terence.

921
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,390
Mckenna's began.
But that switch,

922
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:44,150
the brightness,
the old Julian Julian Jaynes cabral

923
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,881
mind,
not at all.

924
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:49,260
This is David Lewis Williams,
who's professor of anthropology at the

925
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,093
University of Witwatersrand in South
Africa.

926
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,780
His neuro psychological theory of Cave
Art,

927
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,790
all cute Austin Terence Mckenna and food
of the gods.

928
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:00,210
He won a brilliant thinker.
What a brilliant alternative thinker,

929
00:45:00,211 --> 00:45:02,730
but David Lewis Williams at the
University of Witwatersrand had been

930
00:45:02,731 --> 00:45:06,030
working on this problem since 1973,
and his.

931
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,540
His argument is that there are
remarkable similarities that we see in

932
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:13,470
rock and cave art all around the world
are explained that we're dealing with a

933
00:45:13,471 --> 00:45:16,140
shamanistic art.
Shamanism involves altered states of

934
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:18,600
consciousness.
This is typical visions of altered

935
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:21,150
states of consciousness,
and it seems to have a company to great

936
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:24,450
leap forward in human behavior.
And you've covered this in your book.

937
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,100
I covered it in supernatural and natural

938
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:31,210
as did you know Richard Wrangham theory.
This is a highly regarded scientist at

939
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:35,350
Harvard.
So here's the meat eating guy that it's

940
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,940
taking me like cooking the protein.
That's what gives you the energy to

941
00:45:39,941 --> 00:45:41,460
build a huge brain.
Alright,

942
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,710
so now this guy is starting with 10,
10 pluses on his side.

943
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:48,730
He's Harvard and already respected and
even so his book was like,

944
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:52,390
Eh,
probably a series of different events

945
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,210
and a bunch of different factors.
It could be a number of different

946
00:45:55,211 --> 00:45:58,030
things.
So let's get away from go Beckley,

947
00:45:58,031 --> 00:46:02,170
Tappi and ancient civilizations and
let's get back to the geological

948
00:46:02,171 --> 00:46:07,090
evidence which randall urine expert at.
And this is one of the main things that

949
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:09,880
you had a dispute with and this is one
of the reasons why we got everybody

950
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:11,200
together.
Now,

951
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:14,770
what are,
what is your thoughts on what Randall

952
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:19,090
and Graham propose specifically randall,
who is much more on the geological side

953
00:46:19,091 --> 00:46:19,924
of things?
Yeah.

954
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,720
Well this is why I brought in my phone a
friend,

955
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,830
a geologist.
So by way of background after your show,

956
00:46:26,831 --> 00:46:27,730
I thought,
you know this,

957
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,010
let's give this a fair hearing.
This is what we do.

958
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,380
So this will be our cover story and

959
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,190
the summer issue comes out quarterly.
I hope that mark defense is going to be

960
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,120
doing some more work on the draft of his
article for you that is up online

961
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,690
because that article is full of bullshit
statements about me which are

962
00:46:46,691 --> 00:46:50,170
demonstratively false,
so he's happy to.

963
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:53,080
I'm happy to engage with those
particular issues.

964
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,760
Well,
I'll have to put on my reading glasses.

965
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,280
Whatever articles online this has not
been published yet.

966
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,270
Claims it claims that it's a draft of
the article that will appear in the

967
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,300
Tucson 2017 edition of skeptic magazine.
So pull it up grandma and

968
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,190
grandma.
Go over for.

969
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,760
So we'll have mark on.
So here's

970
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,780
magicians of the gods.
By the way,

971
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:20,740
Michael,
I mean,

972
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:23,050
you say that you're here to,
you know,

973
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:27,180
to respectfully aim to get at the truth.
There is contract.

974
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,800
The lost civilization from.
Let me,

975
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,690
let me just get to the top of this.

976
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,460
Uh,
I've got it here.

977
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:37,300
Just bear with me a second.
So amongst the words in mark defense

978
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:41,230
article,
here's accusing me of jumping the

979
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:44,260
public.
He's saying that I'm public enemy number

980
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,020
one.
He's accusing me of arm waving.

981
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:47,890
I wait,
I do.

982
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:50,230
Whereby arms a pontificating.
Well,

983
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:52,330
my grandfather was a minister of the
church,

984
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:56,710
a little interest in peer reviewed
research claim that no academic would

985
00:47:56,711 --> 00:47:58,300
debate.
That's utter bullshit.

986
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:03,010
I had a debate with Zahi Hawass.
He's a leading Egyptian Egyptologist

987
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:06,580
back in 2015.
There was not my fault that Zahi Hawass

988
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:09,780
walked out on that debate.
I can play the video if you like a

989
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:14,380
minute and half of Zahi Hawass lambasted
me and then walking out and refusing to

990
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:17,200
debate further.
So it's bullshit to say I don't debate

991
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:20,890
or I'm not willing to debate.
And finally he says that I'm conning

992
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:23,410
hellacious number of people into buying
his books.

993
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,300
Now,
how can we get any dialogue going when

994
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:28,800
somebody begins like that?
Ben,

995
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,680
would you like some further
bear with me because I just have to

996
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:37,540
scroll down and I don't have a mouse.
I don't have a mouse.

997
00:48:37,541 --> 00:48:39,590
So Hancock and Carlson claimed,
uh,

998
00:48:39,591 --> 00:48:41,740
several times the academic,
no academic would debate them.

999
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:44,140
Not True.
I'm a,

1000
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:47,350
I'm accused of doing an about face,
uh,

1001
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:51,280
since uh,
since fingerprints of the gods are my,

1002
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,940
are my views not allowed to evolve with
new evidence?

1003
00:48:54,941 --> 00:48:58,720
Is that somehow a crime on my part?
Let me just finish then.

1004
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,700
I'm a cheap shot,
you know,

1005
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:03,230
he cites he sues Gomorrah.
Um,

1006
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,060
and,
and,

1007
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:04,600
and,
and,

1008
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,560
and accuses me of not real or not having
the scientific knowledge to issue deal

1009
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:09,730
with issues of gravitation.
No,

1010
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:11,140
it's true that hey,
Susan Amara,

1011
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,330
who is a descendant of the inkers who
has worked 70 years on the mega list of

1012
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:19,810
sexy woman whose father before him or
Fred or Gomorrah works 70 years.

1013
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,840
It's true that he's got a way out.
Theory about gravitation thing is I

1014
00:49:22,841 --> 00:49:26,170
stated my booklet.
It's a way out theory of what I go on to

1015
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,570
say quoted in the attack is that
however,

1016
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,650
this isn't the part of his theory I'm
interested in where I feel he is solidly

1017
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:35,410
persuasive,
is in his observations of the anomalous

1018
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:37,580
character of the monuments of the ad,
these etc. Etc.

1019
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,130
DiffErent.
Doesn't cite that.

1020
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,130
He just presents me as buying what
tamara says.

1021
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:43,390
I mean,
if that's the stanDard that you're going

1022
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:47,320
to have in skeptic magazine,
you have a serious problem and then go

1023
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,660
back to the top.
Uh,

1024
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,660
he contends that got back to the is too
advanced to being completed by hunter

1025
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:56,770
gatherers and must've been constructed
by a more advanced civilization.

1026
00:49:56,771 --> 00:49:57,371
Well,
no,

1027
00:49:57,371 --> 00:49:59,950
that's not what I say.
I say it was constructed by hunter

1028
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:02,650
gatherers,
but that they were advised and supported

1029
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:05,410
by people who had knowledge of this kind
of work beforehand.

1030
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:06,970
Getting,
getting a.

1031
00:50:06,971 --> 00:50:07,900
Well,
I think it's very Different.

1032
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:10,160
I'm not saying it was constructed by.
I'm saying that the,

1033
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,020
that a group of people settled amongst
hunter gatherers and transferred some

1034
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:16,320
skills for them.
He says that,

1035
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:17,380
um,
he quotes me.

1036
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:20,640
Hancock makes the following stunning
claim quote,

1037
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:24,880
our ancestors are being initiated into
the secrets of metals and how to make

1038
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:26,950
swords and knives.
I do not make that claim.

1039
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:31,040
I'm reporting that this claim is made in
the book of enoch.

1040
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,320
that is not my claim.
THen what else?

1041
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,720
So you don't think that's the
explanation?

1042
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,510
Well,
I'm being misrepresented by your author

1043
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:41,210
here.
If he wants to represent me,

1044
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:43,700
if he accuses me of cherry picking,
he shouldn't carry.

1045
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:45,620
Pick my statements issued for
candidates.

1046
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,980
Let's get it right.
It's on the internet.

1047
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,480
Well,
here's a beautiful one he didn't know it

1048
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:56,620
was online.
It was a beautiful one.

1049
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:59,460
He cites klaus schmidt,
um,

1050
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,010
on the,
on the character.

1051
00:51:01,011 --> 00:51:04,160
Actor schmidt makes a salient point
almost as if he anticipated hancock's

1052
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:05,300
book,
quote,

1053
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:08,780
fabulous or mythical creatures,
creatures such as centers or the sphinx

1054
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:12,050
wing bulls are horses do not yet occur
in the iconography.

1055
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,450
And therefore in the mythology of
prehistoric times,

1056
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:18,110
they must be recognized as creations of
the high cultures which arose later.

1057
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:19,760
Well,
bullshit bullshit bullshit.

1058
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:22,010
You've just been talking about the
painted caves.

1059
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,240
Go to show vacay.
If you will see a lion man holding

1060
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,170
started.
Lion man carved out of,

1061
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,740
carved out of mammoth ivory.
Go to go to show the bison man

1062
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,570
straddling lion woman.
Her right arm is transferring a is

1063
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:38,030
transit to transforming into a,
into the head of a lion.

1064
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,780
so certainly these mythical creatures
did exist in the upper paleolithic.

1065
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:43,910
And it's rubbish to say that they did.

1066
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:46,160
And I mean,
how can I go on the teapot?

1067
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,690
Oh yeah.
Okay.

1068
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:51,440
So he's,
he's taking issue with me because I

1069
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:56,441
suggest that the vulture on pillar 43
and enclosure d a is representing the

1070
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:01,280
teapot teapot as some of the
constellation of sagittarius and he goes

1071
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:05,520
and gives us little things of uncle sam
and some other thing that he shows to

1072
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:07,790
anybody can impose any image on,
on anything.

1073
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,650
Well,
it's not my fault That a couple of

1074
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:12,890
academics who didn't even talk to me and
had nothing whatsoever to do to me

1075
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,960
published a major study in the.
I quoted again the mediterranean

1076
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:22,730
archeology and archeometry a peer review
journal where they make precisely that

1077
00:52:22,731 --> 00:52:24,770
identification.
So at least I'm not alone,

1078
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,090
uh,
at least there are.

1079
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:30,320
There are peer reviewed credentials
scholars who also agree that that figure

1080
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:35,150
is representing the teapot as tourism
within the constellation of sagittarius.

1081
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,210
No reference to that,
um,

1082
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:39,110
shocks,
opinions.

1083
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,560
We're supposed to not go into the
minutia because they've already been

1084
00:52:42,561 --> 00:52:46,310
dismissed by a study by lyricists and
fathi are too far from it.

1085
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,690
That study doesn't dismiss shock at all.
None of that study was done on the body

1086
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:53,720
of the sphinx itself.
It was done in the valley and the sphinx

1087
00:52:53,721 --> 00:52:55,160
temples,
and by the way,

1088
00:52:55,161 --> 00:52:58,070
the dates are extremely troubling.
Some of them could push it as far as

1089
00:52:58,071 --> 00:53:01,880
3000,
600 bc that the work was done or as

1090
00:53:01,881 --> 00:53:06,650
early in some cases as 1000 bc.
I don't think that study proves anything

1091
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,270
and,
and,

1092
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:08,300
and,
and so on.

1093
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:12,110
And so to clarify what you do believe
then so that we don't misrepresent you.

1094
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,750
Uh,
so you don't think that the lost

1095
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:17,810
civilization instructed them on the use
of metals?

1096
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,700
I don't know.
I don't see evidence for that to go.

1097
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,020
Would you put that in the book then?
I didn't put it in the book.

1098
00:53:24,021 --> 00:53:26,190
I was quoting the book of enoch.
It's a huge passage

1099
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,390
on the,
on the book of enoch.

1100
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,780
It's not me who's saying that is the
book of enoch the same?

1101
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,020
I understand,
but why the contract require your

1102
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:39,021
defense to do is to state that hancock
is citing the book of enoch.

1103
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,090
He didn't do that.
That's,

1104
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:42,203
that is,
uh,

1105
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,060
what's the word?
Disingenuous.

1106
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:46,800
Is that the polite word you guys use,
but

1107
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,650
more than disingenuous.
It's a character assassination.

1108
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,340
What the question is,
why would.

1109
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:55,860
What's the context of including that in
your book?

1110
00:53:55,861 --> 00:53:56,790
I forget.
Well,

1111
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,860
the cod,
the context is that actually I was.

1112
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:02,530
I was criticizing zechariah section.
That's primarily what I was saying.

1113
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:05,400
You don't think that a lot of
civilization instructed the people who

1114
00:54:05,401 --> 00:54:07,920
build go beckley tip on the use of
metals in tools.

1115
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:09,450
I see no evidence for that.
I see.

1116
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:10,740
Go back to the top.
I can't,

1117
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,470
I can't go say they instructed them on
the use of metals and tools.

1118
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,990
Unless I can find evidence for what did
they do?

1119
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,710
We don't make generated agriculture.
They created a center of excellence

1120
00:54:19,711 --> 00:54:23,540
around which they,
who built called beckley epi.

1121
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,250
The lost civilization that advise them
that you think happened.

1122
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,920
What did they do if they,
they've come through a cataclysm,

1123
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:34,950
their survivors few in number.
This is my scenario.

1124
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:37,710
You don't have to accept it.
I'm sure you don't.

1125
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,540
Uh,
they settle it amongst.

1126
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:41,490
Take refuge amongst hunter gatherers.
I mean,

1127
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:42,710
I don't know.
You're probably quite.

1128
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,820
Have some survival skills.
I don't have many,

1129
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:45,863
I mean if,
uh,

1130
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,180
if we would have a comedy impact in the
world today,

1131
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:51,990
which will take out all the
underpinnings of modern civilization,

1132
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,290
uh,
I might go settle with hunter gatherer

1133
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,400
is because they are the people who know
best how to live in that situation.

1134
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:58,350
medical skills,
yeah,

1135
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,410
because most had togethers,
but I might be able to transfer some of

1136
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:02,310
my knowledge to them.

1137
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:04,560
I might be able to,
I might have something that I could

1138
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:07,710
transfer to them and I might have very
strong reasons why I might not choose to

1139
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:08,790
transfer all of it.
but.

1140
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:11,670
So in other words,
perhaps this is what happened.

1141
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,510
Okay.
Maybe.

1142
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,340
But how is that different from zachariah
citron that?

1143
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,610
Well,
the aliens advised it.

1144
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,310
Well,
it's,

1145
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,920
I think it's massively different,
especially since zacharias stitching

1146
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:25,320
versus aliens arriving here in 19
seventies.

1147
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,850
Nasa technology,
weirdly,

1148
00:55:26,851 --> 00:55:29,100
he wrote his book in the 19 seventies.
I mean,

1149
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:29,934
I don't,
uh,

1150
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:30,790
I,
I,

1151
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,580
I don't go there.
I don't make that,

1152
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:36,540
I don't make that suggestion.
I'm simply saying perhaps there's been a

1153
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:41,541
forgotten episode in human history.
Perhaps its fingerprints are present at

1154
00:55:41,551 --> 00:55:44,910
a nUmber of sites around the world,
but perhaps the extremely defensive,

1155
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:48,690
arrogant and patronizing attitude of
mainstream academia is stopping us from

1156
00:55:48,691 --> 00:55:52,380
considering that possibility and
therefore I campaign to get that

1157
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:55,860
possibility considered and I try to do
so with as loud a voice as possible.

1158
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,090
Well,
you're doing it,

1159
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,850
man.
It doesn't disturb you that you mean you

1160
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:03,180
run skeptic magazine and someone
publishes something like that.

1161
00:56:03,181 --> 00:56:07,050
If it means that goes against the whole
idea of critical thinking.

1162
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:10,260
I mean,
it's misrepresenting his quotes.

1163
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:12,810
It's misrepresenting his perspective,
his point of view.

1164
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:15,090
It's,
it's really disingenuous.

1165
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,670
This is one reason we're doing this so
we could get his butt.

1166
00:56:17,671 --> 00:56:19,230
Why would anybody write something like
that?

1167
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:22,200
And why would you guys publish something
like that without checking the facts?

1168
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:24,580
We are a.
This was not supposed to be posted

1169
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,550
online.
One of the reason why it's online

1170
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,720
though.
How does something get online to such a

1171
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,550
person who will do that are useful
contributor to your side of the debate?

1172
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:34,743
Uh,
well,

1173
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,630
one of the reasons we're here is to get
your point of view.

1174
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,040
Exactly right.
All right,

1175
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,550
so you're saying that there's no
evidence that any law civilization

1176
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,640
exists only the fingerprints of their,
their influence on later peoples we do

1177
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:51,130
know existed.

1178
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:53,980
I'm saying they're physical objects.
I say go back to the top is one of them.

1179
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,580
I say the sphinx is another,
but see this is that argument from

1180
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:59,650
either ignorance or personal.
Incredulity.

1181
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:03,940
I don't accept the mainstream or I can't
think of how this pyramids could've been

1182
00:57:03,941 --> 00:57:06,100
built.
Therefore it was built by somebody else

1183
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,680
through some other technology.
That's not what I'm saying.

1184
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:10,950
So does postdating.
It just

1185
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,070
thinks he's older.
Uh,

1186
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,360
I do go with Robert Stokes argument on
the geology.

1187
00:57:16,361 --> 00:57:18,520
I'm also very interested in the
astronomy of the site.

1188
00:57:18,521 --> 00:57:20,470
And again,
I have slides that I could show on this

1189
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:23,410
if we have,
if we have time you might want to get

1190
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:27,340
into ed krups criticism of the orion
correlation then why he says it's up to

1191
00:57:27,341 --> 00:57:29,020
upside down.
I can talk to you about that.

1192
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,311
You know,
we do.

1193
00:57:30,311 --> 00:57:32,890
I mean,
I know it had crept argument about that

1194
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,750
and that was from the nineties I think.

1195
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,870
What's your thoughts on robert chuck's
conclusion?

1196
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,510
I don't,
that's not something I know much about,

1197
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:46,110
but it's a huge factor because he knows
about shotgun,

1198
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,250
he rejects it,
the basis of that paper and that paper

1199
00:57:50,251 --> 00:57:55,251
really doesn't date the sphinx.
It works with dating of large blocks in

1200
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:58,480
the valley and the sphinx temple.
There's not a single sample taken from

1201
00:57:58,481 --> 00:57:59,490
this week.
Alright,

1202
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,310
then who dated it,
who dated it liberates us,

1203
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,530
and then why?
Why do mainstream archaeologists not

1204
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:08,950
accept the older data for the sphinx and
the and the answer is because they have

1205
00:58:08,951 --> 00:58:12,930
a whole bunch of other evidence that
points to the date that they think your

1206
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:15,010
answer is very to your question is very
simple.

1207
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:20,011
Mock laner zahi hawass put it on record
back in 1992 when John Anthony West and

1208
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:25,891
robert schoch first presented the
rainfall erosion evidence on the sphinx

1209
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:31,860
and what later on hawaii's said is the
sphinx can't possibly be 12,000 plus

1210
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:35,770
years old because there was no other
culture anywhere in the world that was

1211
00:58:35,771 --> 00:58:38,740
capable of creating large scale
monumental architecture like this.

1212
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,350
Show me one other structure that's
capable of doing that.

1213
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,570
Well,
they could say that in 1992,

1214
00:58:43,571 --> 00:58:46,210
michael,
but they can't say it in 2017,

1215
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:47,630
not sensical beckley.
Tapis.

1216
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,640
If you don't mind,
graham,

1217
00:58:48,641 --> 00:58:49,900
could you please,
for people.

1218
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:52,870
So this could be a standalone thing.
People can understand what is the

1219
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:54,720
argument about the sphinx,
the enclosure,

1220
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,950
the spanx,
and dr robert schoch from boston

1221
00:58:56,951 --> 00:58:59,560
university who's a geologist.
What was his conclusion?

1222
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:04,630
What shock is saying is that the sphinx
and the trench out of which the sphinx

1223
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,690
is cut a bears the unmistakable evidence
of precipitation induced weathering,

1224
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,470
weathering caused by exposure to a
substantial period of heavy rainfall.

1225
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,070
And that is particularly pointed out in
the vertical fissures in the trench.

1226
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:22,100
They see the sphinx itself has been
subject to so restoration over so

1227
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,490
many years that is difficult for people
to even see the core body of the sphinx

1228
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:26,470
today.
Uh,

1229
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,030
but it's these,
you can see the vertical fissures even

1230
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:30,470
down at the back of there.
That is,

1231
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:34,070
that is what shock counts as rainfall,
precipitation induced weathering,

1232
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:37,880
heavy rainfall,
which is selectively removing the softer

1233
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:40,100
layers and leaving the harder layers in
place.

1234
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:45,140
And the problem is we don't have that
rainfall in giza in Egypt four and a

1235
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:47,990
half thousand years ago.
You have to go back much earlier to get

1236
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:52,220
that rainfall as the suggestion.
So that's the suggestion by robert

1237
00:59:52,221 --> 00:59:53,870
charge independently.
Yes.

1238
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,890
If your conclusion is totally
independently.

1239
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,580
Yeah.
Shock disagrees With me on many things.

1240
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,140
It wasn't as a matter of fact.
Uh,

1241
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:01,940
and,
and I disagree with him on many things,

1242
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:03,440
but I,
I think he's on the money on this.

1243
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:06,260
So that alone would set back at least
that one.

1244
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,150
I mean,
it's pretty much established that the

1245
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:11,380
great pyramid of giza was constructed
about 2,500 bc.

1246
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:12,950
Right?
There's absolutely no doubt that a huge

1247
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:17,180
project went on at giza around $2,500.
So your argument involved the parent,

1248
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,970
not that the whole thing was that much
older,

1249
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:24,770
was that parts of it seem to have been
from an earlier civilization or at least

1250
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:28,010
that civilization far far earlier than I
was.

1251
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,010
I would say that the ground plan,
what we have at giza,

1252
01:00:31,011 --> 01:00:34,460
the basic layout of the site was
established in what the ancient

1253
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:39,461
egyptians called zep tepi the first time
a astronomically and geologically I and

1254
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:44,060
my colleagues suggest that the first
time can be dated to the period of about

1255
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:47,690
12 and a half to 13,000 years ago,
that,

1256
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,300
that that was when the site was laid out
because there's an intriguing

1257
01:00:50,301 --> 01:00:53,510
astronomical alignments of the great
pyramids to the belt of orion.

1258
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:57,380
I know ed crop has a completely opposIte
view on this and have the great sphinx

1259
01:00:57,381 --> 01:01:00,350
to the constellation of leo rising
[inaudible] housing,

1260
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:03,710
the sun on the equinox,
the astrological age of leo.

1261
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:05,970
Again,
I have slides I can in that would align

1262
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,280
with the geological evidence that robert
schoch complies with a geological

1263
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:12,320
evidence.
They always eight years of age of leo,

1264
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,360
pretty much exactly spans the younger
dryas as metro thing.

1265
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,980
And so the only argument agaInst that at
the time was that there were no other

1266
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:21,350
structures like that from 12,000 years.
Correct.

1267
01:01:21,351 --> 01:01:25,520
And then ben crump said that the,
that the orion correlation wasn't real.

1268
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,920
Uh,
because it was upside down.

1269
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,150
I do want to get into that now.

1270
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,940
Well first,
that's not the only argument.

1271
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:32,571
It's that,
okay,

1272
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:37,571
if the sphinx is built or the layout for
the whole thing is built in say 10,

1273
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:42,440
11,000 years ago and then,
and then the pyramids are built 2,500

1274
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:45,680
bc.
What happened in between where all the

1275
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:47,630
people that trash the places where they
lived,

1276
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:49,130
styles

1277
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:51,770
of construction but not dated in
between.

1278
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,140
I would propose michael something like a
monastery,

1279
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:58,250
which has a relatively small
archeological footprint,

1280
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,950
is on the side.
I mean the idea of information,

1281
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:04,760
knowledge and traditions lasting for
thousands of years within a religious

1282
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:08,810
system shouldn't be too absurd to us.
I'm in judaism is dealing with ideas

1283
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:12,070
that are already best part of 4,000
years old if we go back to the child

1284
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,810
sees and so on and so forth.
So that's all I'm suggesting really

1285
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:16,460
that,
that the idea is preserved,

1286
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:20,310
maintained that the,
the survivors of on the site,

1287
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,410
but something like a monastery,
which is,

1288
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:24,630
which has got a very small archeological
footprint.

1289
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:26,310
It is not high.
Perhaps.

1290
01:02:26,311 --> 01:02:28,680
Again,
one can only speculate and I think

1291
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:31,500
there's a lot of speculation on the
archeological side to one can only

1292
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:33,900
speculate,
perhaps having gone through a cataclysm,

1293
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,260
perhaps they felt to blame for this
wrongly or rightly,

1294
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:40,140
I mean there are many,
many traditions in which humanity's

1295
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:44,280
behavior is implicated in the cataclysm
that takes place and perhaps they didn't

1296
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:47,610
want to switch civilization on
completely right there.

1297
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,880
Perhaps they perhaps they waited,
pass down the knowledge through

1298
01:02:50,881 --> 01:02:55,710
initiates enough was there to create a
mystery because it's undoubtedly a

1299
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:58,260
mystery that the construction of the
great pyramids,

1300
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,670
the first huge pyramids in Egypt
proceeded only really by the xhosa

1301
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,340
pyramid at sakara.
That the construction of the great

1302
01:03:05,341 --> 01:03:09,660
pyramids is vastly superior to the
construction of the pyramids of the

1303
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:13,640
fifth and sixth dynasty that follow it.
And that's a little bit counterintuitive

1304
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,590
that we have this collapsed and skills
one would have expected it to get

1305
01:03:16,591 --> 01:03:18,930
better.
So it sounds like the work on the

1306
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:21,240
pyramid started already with a level of
knowledge.

1307
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:22,831
Yes,
but okay,

1308
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:23,700
so here's,
here's,

1309
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:27,510
I would think about that.
There's a lot of perhaps seeing and

1310
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:32,650
maybes because big as well,
so you have a bunch of egyptologists and

1311
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:36,840
archeologists who have been working on
this site for centuries.

1312
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:40,470
This is one of the most ancient
mysteries and so on and so say,

1313
01:03:40,471 --> 01:03:44,100
let's say there's like 20 lines of
evidence that point to built roughly

1314
01:03:44,101 --> 01:03:47,340
around this time period here and then
you come on and say,

1315
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:49,500
okay,
but there's this one anomaly of the rain

1316
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:52,380
thing that in the there was only rain at
this time.

1317
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,430
Now there's a huge gap.
You have one anomaly or line of evidence

1318
01:03:56,431 --> 01:03:59,270
here and like 20 here we're talking
about different structures,

1319
01:03:59,271 --> 01:04:01,710
so there's not a lot of evidence that
points to the sphinx being from a

1320
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:02,850
particular time period.
Well,

1321
01:04:02,851 --> 01:04:04,630
he's saying like 12,000,

1322
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,240
right?
I'm saying the rainfall evidence

1323
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:08,560
suggests that by other evidence that
alignment,

1324
01:04:08,561 --> 01:04:11,100
that is alignment with the constellation
of leo housing,

1325
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:11,930
the sun,
right?

1326
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:12,990
Dawn,
on the spring equinox,

1327
01:04:12,991 --> 01:04:14,040
it's an equinox.
Your market.

1328
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:16,560
Nobody would dispute that.
Nobody would dispute that.

1329
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,430
The age of digit.
Well,

1330
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:17,911
no.
I mean,

1331
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:19,830
if you make a monument pointing
perfectly joyous,

1332
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:23,010
I've stood on the back of the sphinx at
dawn on the spring equinox,

1333
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:25,290
and believe me,
I guess I could show a picture.

1334
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:28,110
It's head lines up perfectly with the
risinG sun,

1335
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:30,030
but no,
I don't think anybody even crop is

1336
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:31,270
disputing that.
it's an equinox.

1337
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:32,610
Your market.
Now here's the thing,

1338
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:35,120
you're an ancient egyptian.
You're building an equinox.

1339
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:39,000
Your market in 2,500 bc.
Do you know what constellation is?

1340
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:42,480
Housing the son in two thousAnd 500 bc.
I haven't run a little program.

1341
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,430
It's the constellation of taurus.
So.

1342
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,070
So logically,
if you're creating an equitable and the

1343
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:49,860
ancient egyptians Were not shy about
making images of balls,

1344
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:52,150
plenty of them.
If you're making an equinox,

1345
01:04:52,151 --> 01:04:56,520
your marker in 2,500 bc reshoot,
create it in the form of a bull,

1346
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:58,950
not in the form of a lion.
You know?

1347
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:01,110
That's the.
That's the puzzling issue.

1348
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:05,550
And yet we do have a time when a lion
constellation housed the sun at dawn on

1349
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:07,740
the spring equinox,
and that is the period of the younger

1350
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:08,650
dryas.
Okay.

1351
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:11,850
I'd say that's a pretty big leap.
I know you say that and your colleagues

1352
01:05:11,851 --> 01:05:12,680
also that too,
and

1353
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,910
so now and then we have a gap of about
five or 6,000 years where there's

1354
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,090
nothing.
There's no real.

1355
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,440
Yeah,
please do.

1356
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,020
I'm going to refer back to several
articles that were published in the

1357
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,090
eighties and nineties.
This one is from from nature,

1358
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,660
early eighties,
late quaternary history of denial and

1359
01:05:28,661 --> 01:05:33,000
what it's discussing is the evidence
that there was a major shift in the in

1360
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:38,010
the hydraulic regime of the nile river.
It says between 20,000 and 12,000 years

1361
01:05:38,711 --> 01:05:43,711
before present when timberline into
headwaters was lower vegetation cover

1362
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,620
more opened in today.
The nile was a highly seasonal,

1363
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:52,621
braided river which brought mixed course
and find sediments down to Egypt and

1364
01:05:52,691 --> 01:05:56,890
Sudan.
This cold dry interval had entered ended

1365
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,920
by 12,500 years before present when
overflow from lake victoria and higher

1366
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:08,490
rainfall in Ethiopia sent extraordinary
floods down the main aisle and those

1367
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:15,511
floods had been documented to have been
120 feet above the modern flood plain of

1368
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:19,060
denial.
Any civilization or whatever you want to

1369
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:22,810
call it,
living along denial river at that time

1370
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:27,550
would have had to abandoned whatever
they were doing there in the industry

1371
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:28,120
regime.

1372
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,090
This intensified hydraulic regime.
And it says,

1373
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:35,800
it goes on to say it marked a
revolutionary change to continuous flow

1374
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:39,220
with a superimposed flood peak.
So what happened is that there was a

1375
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:44,221
major environmental change that occurred
right there around 12,000 to 12,000,

1376
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:47,050
500 years.
The dating could be adjusted somewhat

1377
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:51,430
since the early eighties,
but the point is made is that because of

1378
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:55,810
a major hydrological change,
major vegetational cover change,

1379
01:06:55,811 --> 01:07:00,610
major environmental change,
this would've caused also in imposed

1380
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:04,570
changes upon whatever culture was
existing ehr or living there at the

1381
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:05,890
time.
Now,

1382
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:10,060
what we have is in the aftermath of that
event,

1383
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,910
we have basically the emergence of
desert,

1384
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:17,080
which now would require serious
adaptation.

1385
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:21,510
It's very likely to that these events,
uh,

1386
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:25,600
could have also decimated the population
at the time leaving,

1387
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:28,360
um,
basically no workforce.

1388
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:32,320
And then over a period of two or three
or 4,000 years,

1389
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:35,800
you find that,
that there is enough of a recovery that

1390
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:39,190
these kinds of monumental structures can
be renewed.

1391
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:41,800
Um,
but it's clear from this and a lot of

1392
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:45,390
other studies studies in the eastern
mediterranean showing that there are sap

1393
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:50,391
propel layers which is caused,
which is basically material that has

1394
01:07:50,711 --> 01:07:55,711
been washed in from the continental
surface that has not oxidized it.

1395
01:07:56,081 --> 01:08:00,910
HIs essentially become rotten and
carried in organic material,

1396
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:05,340
carried in off of the continents by this
enhanced regime of,

1397
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:10,350
of waterflow actually forcing so much
water that there was a freshwater lid on

1398
01:08:11,411 --> 01:08:14,060
the eastern mediterranean that,
uh,

1399
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:17,270
caused a cessation in the,
the,

1400
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,510
the,
the circulation between the upper waters

1401
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:24,440
and the lower waters,
reducing the amount of oxygen brought

1402
01:08:24,441 --> 01:08:26,120
down to the,
to the lower waters.

1403
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:29,540
And so you had these layers of mud that
formed on the bottom of the

1404
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:34,541
mediterranean that show this massive
influx of fresh water flowing off of,

1405
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,140
out of denial and off of the,
the egyptian continent at this same

1406
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:39,950
time.

1407
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:44,570
So clearly the evidence shows that there
were major climatic changes that

1408
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:49,571
occurred around this time.
It is not so speculative to,

1409
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,310
to imagine that whoever,
whatever,

1410
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:56,750
and we don't have to invoke any kind of
a super advanced civilization,

1411
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:01,040
but whatever cultures were there that
were perhaps capable of carving blocks

1412
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:05,780
of stone transporting blocks of stone as
they were at go back during this time

1413
01:09:05,781 --> 01:09:09,440
range would have been that their,
that their activity would have been

1414
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:13,730
interrupted to the extent that it
might've taken millennia to,

1415
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,470
to recover,
to get the,

1416
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,880
get the labor force necessary to
undertake major monumental programs on

1417
01:09:19,881 --> 01:09:22,010
the giza plateau.
So,

1418
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:25,970
so I think that if we assume this
gradual listic scenario,

1419
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,640
yeah,
that's a fair question to ask were what

1420
01:09:28,641 --> 01:09:32,570
happened in that interval.
But if there is a major climatic

1421
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:37,430
downturn and a major disruption of the
several patterns of whatever culture was

1422
01:09:37,431 --> 01:09:40,000
already there,
then you know,

1423
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,500
now we might have an explanation why
there would be a gap,

1424
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:46,410
especially if these events caused a,
uh,

1425
01:09:46,411 --> 01:09:49,250
a bottleneck in the population of the
area.

1426
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,870
of course,
this is all speculative,

1427
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:55,670
but it is not speculative to say that
there is multiple lines of evidence

1428
01:09:55,671 --> 01:10:00,671
suggesting these major even cataclysmic
changes that engulfed that part of the

1429
01:10:00,891 --> 01:10:03,620
world during that era,
so that could,

1430
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:06,440
that could provide an explanation of why
there is a gap there.

1431
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:10,130
Makes total sense.
Well,

1432
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:15,280
it does it because does it not only if
you have to have this thing in

1433
01:10:15,801 --> 01:10:18,830
conjunction with 12,000 years ago in the
lost civilization,

1434
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:23,390
if you just say that rain water erosion
on the sphinx,

1435
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:29,180
it is not an explanation for the age and
that the traditional accepted age is

1436
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,210
what we think it is.
Then there's no gap to fill.

1437
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:34,700
Yeah,
so really we're talking about is we

1438
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:35,300
have,
again,

1439
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,460
lots of evidence here.
One anomaly here.

1440
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,260
I really want the anomaly thing to
stick,

1441
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,650
so I got to explain the gap.
The gap is explained by environmental

1442
01:10:42,651 --> 01:10:43,410
changes.

1443
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:46,380
What is the.
What is the lots of evidence other than

1444
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:49,200
a lot of assumptions.
It's babies.

1445
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:52,440
It's actually,
can you cite me a single contemporary

1446
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:55,440
instruction from the date that the
sphinx is supposed to have been made?

1447
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:58,260
That refers to the swings.
I'm sorry.

1448
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,550
Can you cite a single contemporary
inscription,

1449
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:06,960
contemporary contemporary to the date
that egyptologists ascribed to the

1450
01:11:06,961 --> 01:11:08,780
sphinx in other ways during the reign of
[inaudible]?

1451
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:12,030
Can you cite me a single inscription
that talks about the sphinx being built?

1452
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:13,630
This is scott.
I don't.

1453
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,000
I don't study this area.
I don't know.

1454
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,050
Okay.
Well you can't because there is no such

1455
01:11:17,051 --> 01:11:18,120
inscription.
Okay.

1456
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,050
Well,
so what one would have thought they

1457
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:22,890
would.
Well maybe it's a giant project is 270

1458
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:24,420
feet long,
is 70 feet high.

1459
01:11:24,421 --> 01:11:26,550
It's carved out of solid rock.
Nothing,

1460
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:28,860
but you have no reference to toll in the
old kingdom.

1461
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,800
You actually have to come down to the
new kingdom to get references to the

1462
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:34,710
sphinx and inscriptions that.
But you've already said that the

1463
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:36,630
pyramids were built at the time we think
they were built,

1464
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,480
not thousands.
I would say that a great deal of work

1465
01:11:39,481 --> 01:11:42,100
was done on the pyramids at the time of
2,500 bc.

1466
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:45,180
I think the ground plan was laid out and
we have like the step pyramid,

1467
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:48,060
which is crude or not as well designed
as the other pyramids.

1468
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,980
That's,
that's a transitional stage at that time

1469
01:11:50,981 --> 01:11:53,760
often argued to be a transitional stage.
have you been to the step?

1470
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:55,590
I'm sure.
RigHt.

1471
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:57,510
And you've been to giza though?
No,

1472
01:11:57,511 --> 01:11:58,950
I've never been to giza.
Oh dear.

1473
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:00,840
Well,
will they do make a very different

1474
01:12:00,841 --> 01:12:01,651
impact?
I mean,

1475
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:03,450
I've climbed the great pyramid five
times.

1476
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:06,090
I mean,
you're dealing with something orders of

1477
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:08,760
magnitude different in terms of what's
required.

1478
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,760
I mean this thing weighs 6 million tons,
but it's 481 feet high.

1479
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:17,580
It consists of two and a half million
individual blocks of stone.

1480
01:12:17,581 --> 01:12:21,720
It's aligned to true north within three
60th of a single degree.

1481
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,440
I mean,
to compare that to zosyn,

1482
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,400
uh,
is really not a valid comparison at all.

1483
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:30,120
What's more interesting to me is the
radical decline that takes place in

1484
01:12:30,121 --> 01:12:32,550
pyramid building skills.
In the fifth and sixth titus,

1485
01:12:32,551 --> 01:12:35,370
he go to ou nasco,
the pepe go to tatiana sakara.

1486
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:38,340
These are a shambles.
You can hardly even recognize them as a

1487
01:12:38,341 --> 01:12:39,990
payment.
What happened to all that knowledge

1488
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,430
that's invested in the great pyramid?
Why does Egypt evolve so rapidly?

1489
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:45,420
Uh,
what,

1490
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,960
how do we explain this pristine,
amazing work that's done on the great

1491
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:50,730
period?
Unless there's a legacy of knowledge

1492
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:53,920
being attached to it.
So every archeologist,

1493
01:12:54,260 --> 01:12:57,060
Egypt,
egyptian archeologist and egyptian knows

1494
01:12:57,061 --> 01:13:00,390
everything you just said they didn't and
they don't accept any of the arguments.

1495
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,750
Why not?
That's why I'm needed because somebody's

1496
01:13:02,770 --> 01:13:05,610
got to counter this.
Is it just that they're closed minded

1497
01:13:05,611 --> 01:13:09,030
and they follow a lot of us and they
never think for themselves.

1498
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:11,680
You want to see a close mind,
I'll play you one and a half minute

1499
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:12,291
videos out here,
wash,

1500
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:14,880
refusing to debate with me,
but all of them,

1501
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:19,350
every one of the egyptologist and
archeologist over the last two centuries

1502
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:21,690
and so on,
they're all dogmatically,

1503
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:24,750
closed minded and they can't see the
arguments declares you or is it?

1504
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:28,080
They're not convinced by your argument.
They're not convinced by my argument.

1505
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:31,770
They genuinely an absolutely believed
that their argument is right.

1506
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,730
The notion that I'm proposing is
apparently so preposterous to them that

1507
01:13:35,731 --> 01:13:40,200
it isn't even worthy of consideration,
but it is worthy of insults and attacks

1508
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:43,260
on me,
on my integrity or my decency as a human

1509
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:44,730
being.
On my honesty.

1510
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,430
All of those things get attacked,
you know,

1511
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:49,980
because mainstream and that's fine.
I'm ready for that and that.

1512
01:13:49,981 --> 01:13:52,710
By the way,
I know that archaeologists academics

1513
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,630
constantly attack each other all the
time.

1514
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:57,540
I used to take this stuff personally,
but then when I see what they do to each

1515
01:13:57,541 --> 01:13:59,340
other,
the ravaging attack,

1516
01:13:59,341 --> 01:14:04,341
dogs are let loose on on any new idea.
I sometimes wish scientists would,

1517
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:08,040
would actually look for what's good in a
new idea rather than what's bad,

1518
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:11,740
but I get why they do it for that,
but in other integrated young graduate

1519
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:12,310
student

1520
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,870
working in that area could make a name
for himself by overturning a son was a

1521
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:20,320
young graduate student at the university
of cardiff studying egyptology.

1522
01:14:20,321 --> 01:14:23,770
He got marked down in his degree because
he proposed the possibility that the

1523
01:14:23,771 --> 01:14:27,160
pyramids and the sphinx might be or
might have older origins.

1524
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:30,760
He was impressed by my work.
It did him a lot of harm in his degree

1525
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:35,200
and and if all this was true,
then eventually I'm announcing my point,

1526
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:37,840
my point,
which is if you go against the

1527
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:40,220
mainstream view,
your career does not progress as an ego.

1528
01:14:40,990 --> 01:14:42,670
I disagree.
I mean how many an example,

1529
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:45,940
how is it that we know?
Anything that we know about each example

1530
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:48,700
from Egypt tology of somebody who's gone
against the mainstream view and being

1531
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:49,800
lauded for,
so doing well,

1532
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:53,790
we don't believe everything about it
that we believe two centuries ago and

1533
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:55,000
say napoleon's time.

1534
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,760
Right?
How did that knowledge come about?

1535
01:14:57,761 --> 01:15:01,180
How did all the change that science
identity begins with sean polygon and

1536
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:04,870
the deciphering of the rosetta stone?
How was he able to do that against the

1537
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:06,800
mainstream?
There was no mainstream.

1538
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:13,740
The mainstream has taken time to form
and it's a very solid now just all sing

1539
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:17,320
from the same hymn book.
You'll find very little disagreement in

1540
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,330
every field,
but somehow or another,

1541
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:23,320
einstein managed to make an impact
because he turned out to be right.

1542
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:25,420
Well,
I'm no einstein and I don't know if I'm

1543
01:15:25,421 --> 01:15:27,070
right,
but I'm going to continue to oppose that

1544
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,540
mainstream.
Somebody has to earth.

1545
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,020
That's a valid comparison.
Einstein and archeology take

1546
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:35,320
paleoanthropology.
I mean it's a completely different field

1547
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:37,300
now than a century ago.
How did that happen?

1548
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,060
If no one ever accepts new ideas?
They do.

1549
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:43,870
It happens all the time while they're
being forced to accept basically tempe

1550
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:46,020
and that's a new idea that like,
you know,

1551
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:49,240
what you were talking about things
taking a long time and what seems like a

1552
01:15:49,241 --> 01:15:52,480
long time to us is really a blink of the
eye and in terms of archeology,

1553
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:55,780
we're in the middle of that were
essentially in the middle of that with

1554
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:58,570
things like go beckley,
tappy with forbes publishing an article

1555
01:15:58,571 --> 01:16:03,070
about the younger dryas possibly being
impacted by comments and that being one

1556
01:16:03,071 --> 01:16:04,600
of the causes of mass extinction.

1557
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,540
Right?
And when these are all mainstream ideas

1558
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:11,470
and everyone alvarez proposed the impact
hypothesis for the demise of the

1559
01:16:11,471 --> 01:16:14,320
dinosaurs in 1980.
It was ridiculed and,

1560
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:17,080
but he turned out to be right.
And then that became the accepted.

1561
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,050
It takes time.
But what was the title?

1562
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,070
People are challenging.
Those are the key turning point,

1563
01:16:21,071 --> 01:16:22,630
the finding of the crater.
That's what,

1564
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:25,330
that's what made the difference so hard
to argue with it.

1565
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:26,650
So I get,
where's your creator?

1566
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,510
Well,
this is where perhaps we need to bring

1567
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:29,440
in our phone,
a friend,

1568
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,050
malcolm,
the comp,

1569
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:33,430
one of the,
one of the younger dryas impact impact

1570
01:16:33,431 --> 01:16:34,630
scientists.
I mean the,

1571
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:36,700
the point,
the point being made is the following,

1572
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:40,140
firstly that the primary impacts were on
ice there.

1573
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:42,970
That they may have been as many as four
impacts that they were on the north

1574
01:16:42,971 --> 01:16:45,820
american ice cap.
Some creators have been suggested,

1575
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:48,100
for example,
very deep holes in the great lakes,

1576
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,980
uh,
other creators have been and will be

1577
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,500
looked at by the team in the,
in the coming months,

1578
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:56,880
whether it includes the corozal created
that quebec,

1579
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:59,410
quebec terrain.
And so on and so forth.

1580
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,200
There are candidates that the creature
has not been found yet.

1581
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:06,520
But I would be surprised if a creator
was easy to find when,

1582
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,211
uh,
you know,

1583
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:09,550
the impact is on two mile deep bass,
you know,

1584
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,990
one of the biggest strewn fields in the
world,

1585
01:17:11,991 --> 01:17:14,430
which is the australian strewn tektites,
drew infield.

1586
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,660
THere's no greater associated with that,
but everybody accepts the impact

1587
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:18,920
proxies.
There's enough of them to,

1588
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:21,410
to justify that.
And that's what's going on around this

1589
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:22,910
impact hypothesis are related

1590
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:27,000
questionnaire is not the lost
civilizations and the demise of humans,

1591
01:17:27,001 --> 01:17:29,850
but the mega financial extinction of
north american mammals.

1592
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:35,240
So this has been long debated before the
impact hypothesis was proposed in the

1593
01:17:35,911 --> 01:17:40,250
competing hypotheses were over hunting.
Humans just haunted them to point where

1594
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,770
not every last one to the point where
the population numbers get too low and

1595
01:17:43,771 --> 01:17:48,300
these species can survive,
or climate change or both the climate

1596
01:17:48,301 --> 01:17:51,920
change week in the populations than the
humans came over and over a hunted him.

1597
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:53,333
Alright,
so,

1598
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:56,640
and then the impact hypothesis is
proposed.

1599
01:17:56,641 --> 01:17:59,400
Okay.
So this was debated and it didn't fare

1600
01:17:59,401 --> 01:18:03,750
that well because there were a lot of
mammals and other species that didn't go

1601
01:18:03,751 --> 01:18:06,390
extinct that you would expect from a
massive impact like that.

1602
01:18:06,570 --> 01:18:07,530
It would have wiped out.
Why?

1603
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:11,190
Why the selected species,
the kinds of species that humans would

1604
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:14,400
hunt are the ones that went extinct.
Whereas these others didn't.

1605
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:15,463
Well,
why

1606
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:19,680
the largest?
There is no evidence.

1607
01:18:19,681 --> 01:18:21,840
The human humans hunted.
The predators.

1608
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:24,540
There is evidence that they hunted
woolly mammoths,

1609
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:27,990
but it's a very sparse.
I mean you have no more than a dozen

1610
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:32,991
sites that show association between a
human hunting and mammoths and a lot of

1611
01:18:33,811 --> 01:18:36,330
those like the lubbock lake site is now
being questioned.

1612
01:18:36,331 --> 01:18:41,331
What was presumably we'd previously
interpreted as being butchering marks on

1613
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,220
on the mammoth remains.
There are now being reinterpreted as

1614
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:49,530
possibly natural marks on the,
on the mammoth bones,

1615
01:18:49,770 --> 01:18:52,470
but it's a big stretch to go from,
okay,

1616
01:18:52,471 --> 01:18:57,330
we've got a dozen sites where we have
mammoth remains and along with those

1617
01:18:57,331 --> 01:19:01,860
mammoth remains we find a few clovis
spearpoints in two or three cases we

1618
01:19:01,861 --> 01:19:06,430
actually flying or they have found spear
points embedded within the mammoth lake

1619
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:10,110
in the rib rib cage,
but it's a very large stretch to go from

1620
01:19:10,111 --> 01:19:14,220
there to say that 10 or $12,
million woolly mammoths or or four

1621
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:19,221
species of mamet's on four continents
were wiped out by paleo indian hunters.

1622
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:24,410
Probably in bands of no more than two or
three dozen we've ever been

1623
01:19:24,550 --> 01:19:28,030
to a head smashed in buffalo site.
Yes,

1624
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:28,660
but,
but,

1625
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:32,950
but that's a good example because
nowhere did that go anywhere close to

1626
01:19:32,951 --> 01:19:35,590
exterminating the species of american
bison.

1627
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,770
But at each site has its own particular
explanation.

1628
01:19:38,830 --> 01:19:40,870
Could be hunting,
could it be a massive flood,

1629
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,011
earthquake,
whatever.

1630
01:19:42,011 --> 01:19:43,420
They'll be a massive flood.
Yes,

1631
01:19:43,421 --> 01:19:45,280
exactly.
I think there you and I would be in

1632
01:19:45,281 --> 01:19:46,060
complete agreement.

1633
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:49,720
That doesn't mean by massive global
versus local cell.

1634
01:19:49,721 --> 01:19:52,450
For example,
there's 50 to mammalian generra went

1635
01:19:52,451 --> 01:19:55,030
extinct in south America.
Why would they go extinct in south

1636
01:19:55,031 --> 01:19:56,700
America at about the time that humans
were moving

1637
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:59,650
down there?
The younger dryas impact hypothesis

1638
01:19:59,651 --> 01:20:02,030
include south America,
indoor impacts there.

1639
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:02,941
It does.
And,

1640
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:04,570
and,
and again,

1641
01:20:04,571 --> 01:20:05,250
the dating of

1642
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:10,250
the migration of humans into America is
controversial at this point.

1643
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,430
Um,
you know,

1644
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,470
there is evidence that humans were there
long before,

1645
01:20:13,471 --> 01:20:15,270
you know,
paul martin's idea of,

1646
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:20,070
of blitzkrieg requires that the animals
be so stupid that they couldn't,

1647
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:25,080
like they had no adaptive capabilities
to the appearance of a new predatory

1648
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:25,950
species.
But well,

1649
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:29,910
what is being demonstrated from
examining the lifeways of,

1650
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:34,710
of the paleo indian peoples,
is that they had very diversified diets

1651
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:38,910
and they were hunter gatherers.
Now,

1652
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:44,180
why would they be choosing the largest,
most dangerous animals to hunt when they

1653
01:20:44,971 --> 01:20:47,370
had such a proliferation of other
smaller animals?

1654
01:20:47,371 --> 01:20:50,400
We know that they were foraging,
we know that they were eating seafood.

1655
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:52,690
There was an and fishing,
um,

1656
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,810
because all of this is being found in
the,

1657
01:20:54,811 --> 01:20:56,470
in the camps.
Um,

1658
01:20:56,790 --> 01:21:01,790
and then it certainly doesn't explain
the extermination of the cave bears.

1659
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:04,350
The short faced bears,
the camelot,

1660
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:08,040
the giant beavers,
the giant armadillos,

1661
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:10,140
the american place to seen lion,
the,

1662
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,013
the,
the,

1663
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:14,490
the ground slots that were the size of
giraffes,

1664
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:17,930
four species of,
of provosts,

1665
01:21:17,931 --> 01:21:21,870
indians,
meaning mammoths extinct on four

1666
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:24,390
continents.
And to me like,

1667
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:26,610
wait a second,
we don't,

1668
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:29,730
we cannot,
we cannot invoke a modern example to,

1669
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,840
to say,
well,

1670
01:21:30,841 --> 01:21:32,910
here is mallory.
Well,

1671
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:35,260
that's controversial also.
Um,

1672
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:38,610
and the nature of the albert's extinct

1673
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:41,380
past eagle,
that's an assumption

1674
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:47,770
that in people with adult adults killing
off all the saber tooth tigers.

1675
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,510
And here's another answer to one of your
questions.

1676
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:51,820
You were saying like why would some of
the animals be alive?

1677
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,120
Well,
we know that the,

1678
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:55,790
the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs
65 million years ago,

1679
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:56,850
it didn't kill everything,
right?

1680
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:00,370
That is a massive impact far bigger than
anything we're talking about.

1681
01:22:00,371 --> 01:22:02,110
And many,
many anImals survive that.

1682
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:04,930
So we don't know why things survive and
why they don't.

1683
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:08,260
It could be proximity to the impact.
It could be that their food source

1684
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:11,200
wasn't removed.
It could be that they're predators were

1685
01:22:11,201 --> 01:22:13,720
wiped out and they managed to survive.
I mean,

1686
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:16,750
there's a lot of animals that are still,
that are alive today in this continent.

1687
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:19,210
Like for instance,
the pronghorn antelope,

1688
01:22:19,450 --> 01:22:21,660
pronghorn antelope,
dan flores,

1689
01:22:21,661 --> 01:22:26,661
who's a wildlife historian,
wrote an amazing book on it and we were

1690
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,400
talking about the,
uh,

1691
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,440
american savannah during,
you know,

1692
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:32,590
like 15,000 plus years ago.

1693
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,030
There was all sorts of crazy animals
millions of years ago that were like

1694
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:40,480
cheetahs that were running down animals
at extreme speeds,

1695
01:22:40,481 --> 01:22:44,230
which is a reason why pronghorn
antelopes can run so much faster than

1696
01:22:44,231 --> 01:22:48,250
any of their current predators because
something much faster than them was

1697
01:22:48,251 --> 01:22:49,750
killing them.
And that was wIped out.

1698
01:22:49,870 --> 01:22:52,350
But they managed to make it.
One of the reasons why they probably

1699
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:54,700
manage to make it is because they're
predators were wiped out.

1700
01:22:56,010 --> 01:22:58,900
It's not an even point,
michael,

1701
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,170
if it's overkill,
it's,

1702
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:04,000
it's intriguing that the ova kill
occurs,

1703
01:23:04,001 --> 01:23:05,920
you know,
precisely the younger dryas window

1704
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:06,520
because

1705
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:10,540
I think you'd agree that now the whole
story of the peopling of the americas is

1706
01:23:10,541 --> 01:23:11,800
pretty much up for grabs.
I mean,

1707
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:16,450
clovis first was the dominant model for
a very long time and under that model

1708
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:20,470
were to envisage these clovis hunters
coming in across the bering land bridge,

1709
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,610
going down the ice free car door and
then in like 800 years with their

1710
01:23:24,611 --> 01:23:27,810
sophisticated fluted points,
they wipe out all the mammoths in in

1711
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,860
north America,
but now we know that humans have been

1712
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:34,780
coexisting and butchering mammas
coexisting with mammas for thousands of

1713
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:36,670
years before that,
possibly tens of thousands of years

1714
01:23:36,671 --> 01:23:38,650
before that.
Evidence in siberia.

1715
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,000
I don't only mean from evidence in
siberia I've.

1716
01:23:41,001 --> 01:23:43,180
I mean,
I can cite you from from nature magazine

1717
01:23:43,181 --> 01:23:44,080
just recently.
Huge,

1718
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:46,750
huge number.
I don't think the yukon is in siberia,

1719
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:49,630
is it?
No one's in north America.

1720
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:53,120
Jack sunk mars,
you know the excavator of thE bluefish

1721
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:57,200
caves in the yukon back in the 19
seventies were proposed,

1722
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:01,240
was proposing that human beings had been
in America is at least 24,000 years ago.

1723
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,960
His repuTation was utterly destroyed.
his research funding was withdrawn.

1724
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:08,680
He was given no access to grants.
He wasn't able to do his work.

1725
01:24:08,681 --> 01:24:11,560
He was heavily penalized and punished by
the community,

1726
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:14,080
and now just a few weeks ago,
we have the smithsonian coming out and

1727
01:24:14,081 --> 01:24:14,710
saying,
sorry,

1728
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:17,800
we got it wrong.
Jack myers was right all along and tom

1729
01:24:17,801 --> 01:24:18,431
dillehay,
you know,

1730
01:24:18,431 --> 01:24:22,510
with his work in monte verde,
the shit that he had to take a.

1731
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,030
I Think we're,
we're in a very interesting time.

1732
01:24:25,031 --> 01:24:29,890
The peopling of the americas is really a
paradigm that has absolutely been

1733
01:24:29,891 --> 01:24:31,300
overthrown.
The notion of,

1734
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,640
well,
you disagree with ms.one and then,

1735
01:24:33,641 --> 01:24:34,490
which is fine.
I'm

1736
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,270
no the mesa verde.
It's an isolated.

1737
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:38,190
Again,
it's an anomaly.

1738
01:24:38,191 --> 01:24:43,191
It's an isolated site where all the
sites between clovis and monteverdi was

1739
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:48,000
still first for thousands and thousands
of years.

1740
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:52,470
Come on my condition.
Where are all the people between clovis

1741
01:24:52,471 --> 01:24:55,300
and motto?
My problem iS your problem.

1742
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,530
It's your problem and bear in monte
veriday and they're there in north

1743
01:24:58,531 --> 01:25:00,800
America.
It's more likely that they'll figure out

1744
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:04,840
why there's a dentist in south american
indians and not in north America.

1745
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:08,460
It's like the nature paper.
I people cross the ocean that,

1746
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:09,361
uh,
that there were.

1747
01:25:09,361 --> 01:25:12,720
Neanderthals are humans in san diego
130,000 years ago.

1748
01:25:12,721 --> 01:25:13,980
Okay.
But when you look at that.

1749
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:15,930
Okay,
so they have mammoth bones.

1750
01:25:15,931 --> 01:25:19,950
It looks like they might have been
broken in the length and the tools,

1751
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:20,850
but they're not.
Okay.

1752
01:25:20,851 --> 01:25:22,650
The tool kind of changing subjects here
though.

1753
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:22,961
Well,
no,

1754
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:23,330
no,
no.

1755
01:25:23,330 --> 01:25:26,160
You're going to quibble the evidence of
human presence.

1756
01:25:26,161 --> 01:25:27,750
That's right.
You'll try to quibble it.

1757
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:30,360
We're not quibble.
Challenge it.

1758
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:33,290
You're quibbling.
Then you're going to rewrite this saying

1759
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:35,400
very specifically.
That's opposing what he just said.

1760
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:39,420
The reason archaeologists don't accept
earlier than clovis,

1761
01:25:39,421 --> 01:25:42,870
say earlier than about 13,000.
14,000 is massively,

1762
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:45,820
massively accepted.
Say mesa verde for example.

1763
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:48,510
Okay.
I have to bring up an image at mesa

1764
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:51,500
verde.
Do accept mason is accepted like.

1765
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:54,090
Well you sure about this as 24,000
years?

1766
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,570
Fifteen plus possibly.
Possibly.

1767
01:25:56,571 --> 01:25:57,440
Significantly.

1768
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:58,081
Yeah.
Okay,

1769
01:25:58,081 --> 01:26:02,280
so significantly 15 is kind of the
outside of the Window that humans came

1770
01:26:02,281 --> 01:26:04,160
across the bering strait.
That's possible.

1771
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,920
Not 24.
Clovis first,

1772
01:26:06,490 --> 01:26:08,630
not 100 and thIrty thousand years ago.
Now,

1773
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,490
if it turns out that that nature papers.
Right,

1774
01:26:10,491 --> 01:26:14,870
and that's confirmed that that does
overturn the mainstream theory for sure,

1775
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:17,300
but why would you.
This is not like your field of study.

1776
01:26:17,301 --> 01:26:19,150
Why would you argue against the nature
of liver?

1777
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:23,400
Okay,
I'll just give you ask professionals

1778
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:25,910
myths.
Number five today,

1779
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:29,690
decades later,
the clovis first model has collapsed.

1780
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:32,690
Okay?
Based on dozens of new studies,

1781
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:37,640
we now know that pre-clovis people's
slaughtered mastodons in Washington

1782
01:26:37,641 --> 01:26:41,900
state dined on desert parsley in Oregon
made all purpose stone tools that were

1783
01:26:41,901 --> 01:26:46,901
ice age version of the $13,000.
That's not no look at 24,000 years down

1784
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:49,490
at the bottom.
Michael,

1785
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:51,650
you know,
are you saying the smithsonian or wrong

1786
01:26:51,651 --> 01:26:52,280
on this?

1787
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:54,290
Michael,
you're jumping to conclusions before you

1788
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:56,930
even read that.
You want to be right so badly.

1789
01:26:56,931 --> 01:26:58,790
You didn't read the part and other
animals.

1790
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:03,740
They're on a second confIrming that
humans had butchered horses and other

1791
01:27:03,741 --> 01:27:06,260
animals.
They're 24,000 years ago.

1792
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:09,800
It says it right there and you are
arguing guested without even reading it,

1793
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,690
which means you want to be right.
No,

1794
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,460
no.
That's absolutely what's going on.

1795
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:17,840
So I have no dog in this fight.
We started pointing at you being

1796
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:20,510
published skeptic magazine and you have
no dog in the fight.

1797
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,450
You're asking me,
why don't mainstream archaeologists

1798
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:28,451
except you should be skeptical of hens
about color,

1799
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:30,900
whatever you want.
it goes back 1130.

1800
01:27:30,901 --> 01:27:33,770
What do you think about what that says
that there's evidence they butchered

1801
01:27:33,771 --> 01:27:35,540
horses 24,000 years ago.
Okay.

1802
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:37,910
I would have to check the site on it.
I haven't seen this article,

1803
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:40,520
but now that you have seen it,
not my problem.

1804
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,580
Okay.
Probably hear opposing this and you're

1805
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:47,640
saying there's no evidence you have any
fucking article.

1806
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:51,800
I'm not opposing anything.
I'm saying you certainly the reason why

1807
01:27:51,860 --> 01:27:55,040
scientists except these dates here
because there's lots and lots of

1808
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:59,050
evidenCe for that is scientists and
eleven thousand twelve thousand is that

1809
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:02,580
a scientist and you find one person that
says 24,000,

1810
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,360
another one like two weeks ago.
It's not one person.

1811
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,530
you're walking this without really doing
any research about it and then the

1812
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:16,340
article is titled what happens when an
archeologist challenges mainstream

1813
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:21,520
thinking and the smithsonian in the
month of march.

1814
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,840
Okay.
Jack sunk mas.

1815
01:28:23,841 --> 01:28:28,130
It was a brutal experience.
Something that sank mas once likened to

1816
01:28:28,131 --> 01:28:32,120
the spanish inquisition at conferences,
audiences paid little heat to his

1817
01:28:32,121 --> 01:28:34,040
presentation,
giving short shrift to the evidence,

1818
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:34,791
et cetera,
et cetera,

1819
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:36,650
et cetera.
So it was always the same when he

1820
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:38,960
proposed that bluefish quays was 24,000
years old.

1821
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:42,020
It was not accepted.
What the smithsonian are saying is now

1822
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,080
this is accepted.
You need to get up to speed with data.

1823
01:28:45,081 --> 01:28:46,370
Michael,
my,

1824
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:48,770
my archeology friends like jared
diamond,

1825
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:51,320
who I just checked with on this who's at
ucla,

1826
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:53,170
but he certainly has a dog in the fight.
And,

1827
01:28:53,230 --> 01:28:54,890
and uh,
well he just says,

1828
01:28:54,891 --> 01:28:57,170
here's the problem.
For 50 years,

1829
01:28:57,171 --> 01:29:02,171
people propose pre-clovis.
ExamPles recites or they never hold up.

1830
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,250
They always dating turned out to be
incorrect.

1831
01:29:05,260 --> 01:29:08,640
The carbon 14 was not calibrated right.
There was this,

1832
01:29:08,641 --> 01:29:10,260
there was that they never hold up.

1833
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:13,920
Essentially your friend for 50 years.
Well,

1834
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:17,710
you're quoting a friend who says the
evidence hasn't held up before.

1835
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,700
Instead of quoting these articles with
these scientists were talking about the

1836
01:29:21,701 --> 01:29:25,780
data that's showing the human beings
butchered horses 24,000 years ago.

1837
01:29:25,781 --> 01:29:27,940
You're disputing it just because you
talked to a friend.

1838
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:31,160
I'm saying that that has to be
confirmed.

1839
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:34,370
that particular argue against it.
I'm not arguing against.

1840
01:29:34,371 --> 01:29:35,270
Certainly were.
No,

1841
01:29:35,271 --> 01:29:39,410
I'm just saying that was my right.
I feel you were arguing against it and

1842
01:29:39,411 --> 01:29:42,140
saying that it's not the case and then
you seem to be,

1843
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:45,860
if I'm correct,
you seem to be a clovis first advocate,

1844
01:29:45,970 --> 01:29:47,720
but put you,
put you in reputation on the line and

1845
01:29:47,721 --> 01:29:50,030
say you're not going to put a label on
it.

1846
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:53,840
I'm going to say in the latest evidence
that that overwhelmingly shows humans

1847
01:29:53,841 --> 01:29:57,410
coming across the siberian straight into
north America,

1848
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,611
11,
12,

1849
01:29:58,611 --> 01:29:59,450
13,
14,

1850
01:29:59,451 --> 01:30:02,990
15,000 years and they definitely did.
Then they definiteLy did that.

1851
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:05,960
Did they before what could push it back?
Much earlier?

1852
01:30:05,961 --> 01:30:08,060
It would be if they came by boat.
Okay,

1853
01:30:08,061 --> 01:30:11,060
so like where I live in santa barbara,
there are sites on the channel.

1854
01:30:11,061 --> 01:30:16,010
Islands had to go back 11,
12,000 years ago and they came by boat.

1855
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:18,770
Now the problem is is if they lived on
the shores,

1856
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,630
which is where the good fishing and
eating is,

1857
01:30:21,470 --> 01:30:25,160
those are underwater and short of doing
good underwater archeology,

1858
01:30:25,161 --> 01:30:28,070
which is hard to do and expensive and
most of it's probably gone.

1859
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:30,950
We may never know.
One of my beefs with archeology actually

1860
01:30:30,951 --> 01:30:34,220
is that 10 million square miles of the
planet that were above water during the

1861
01:30:34,221 --> 01:30:37,600
ice age or underwater now and marine
archeology still mainly looking at ship

1862
01:30:37,601 --> 01:30:38,360
wrecks,
you know?

1863
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:39,193
Well,
okay.

1864
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:40,800
They do that because It's.
It's,

1865
01:30:41,820 --> 01:30:44,180
it's where the light is leaves the big
unanswered question.

1866
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,850
At any rate,
so for the record It can at least say

1867
01:30:46,851 --> 01:30:49,300
that you completely opposed the
smithsonian's position on this that

1868
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:51,260
there has been no paradigm shift will
look at this.

1869
01:30:51,261 --> 01:30:55,730
I haven't seen this besides anything I'm
not aware of the horse find from 24,000

1870
01:30:55,731 --> 01:30:56,120
years ago.

1871
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:59,220
I am aWare of the hundred 30,000 year
date from the nature paper.

1872
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,940
I have a slide on that too,
and if

1873
01:31:04,190 --> 01:31:06,410
tools,
they're nothing like clovis points.

1874
01:31:06,411 --> 01:31:09,680
It's just a big hand rock that might
have been used.

1875
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:11,840
It might've been random.
Sorry,

1876
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,530
a big hand rock is all there is before
13,000 years ago.

1877
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,690
No,
I'm talking about 130,000 year old site.

1878
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:20,090
One hundred and $30.
You're talking about the san diego is.

1879
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,780
We don't.
We don't need to talk about that.

1880
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:25,880
That raises interesting questions.
Was it neanderthals?

1881
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:29,420
Was it denisovans?
Was it anatomically modern humans?

1882
01:31:29,421 --> 01:31:32,180
One hundred and $30,000 raises
interesting questions.

1883
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:34,570
President misinterpreted site because
they aren't.

1884
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:39,140
I'm not pinning anything to that.
I'm just saying yes.

1885
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,480
That report was published in nature.

1886
01:31:41,980 --> 01:31:44,770
The stone tools.
It's about how the bones were shattered

1887
01:31:44,771 --> 01:31:46,000
and they believed the bones are
shattered.

1888
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:49,210
Deliberately indicating that someone was
trying to get at the marrow indicating

1889
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:53,260
more maybe or a tractor rolled over it a
couple of years ago.

1890
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:53,851
No,
no,

1891
01:31:53,851 --> 01:31:54,270
no,
no,

1892
01:31:54,270 --> 01:31:54,910
no,
no,

1893
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:55,370
no,
no,

1894
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:58,360
no one had known it is excavated.
That's just speculation.

1895
01:31:58,780 --> 01:31:59,920
Important.
This part,

1896
01:31:59,921 --> 01:32:00,100
this

1897
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:05,100
was one of the immediately defined,
has been quibbled by the archeological

1898
01:32:05,441 --> 01:32:07,450
mainstream.
Of course it's been published by the

1899
01:32:07,451 --> 01:32:09,880
archeological mainstream too and the
rest of the mainstream is quibbling

1900
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:12,220
with.
You said that can't happen.

1901
01:32:12,221 --> 01:32:14,170
We will say,
what can't happen that the mainstream

1902
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:17,830
won't allow a radical ideas to nature
and published it,

1903
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:20,790
and the article,
the idea is being quibbled and

1904
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:25,690
nature certainly would not have
published it if the evidence would not

1905
01:32:25,691 --> 01:32:27,580
strong.
I accept that nature is not in the

1906
01:32:27,581 --> 01:32:29,110
business of publishing,
you know,

1907
01:32:29,590 --> 01:32:30,970
fringey stuff.
It's a.

1908
01:32:30,980 --> 01:32:32,890
It is.
It is a radical proposal,

1909
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:35,560
but it's strong enough to justify
publication in nature.

1910
01:32:35,561 --> 01:32:38,790
what's interesting to me is that the
immediate reaction of the archaeological

1911
01:32:38,791 --> 01:32:39,700
community is not say,
well,

1912
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:41,410
what could this mean?
Let's,

1913
01:32:41,411 --> 01:32:42,730
let's look into the implications of
this.

1914
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:46,960
I mean if there were neanderthals or
denisovans in north America a hundred

1915
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:50,320
and 30,000 years ago,
we have a whole new scenario building

1916
01:32:50,321 --> 01:32:52,240
here that really should interest
everyone instead of.

1917
01:32:52,330 --> 01:32:55,960
Instead of the first reaction is let's
destroy this because it's really

1918
01:32:55,961 --> 01:32:57,040
annoying.
Let's get rid of it.

1919
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:59,590
Let's prove it's wrong.
Let's suggest tHat it was a fucking

1920
01:32:59,591 --> 01:33:01,570
bulldozer or something like that.
Maybe it was,

1921
01:33:01,571 --> 01:33:02,980
I don't know.
The work hasn't been.

1922
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:05,620
Hasn't been done yet,
but that instant sort of.

1923
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:08,920
It's almost like an immune response to
a.

1924
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:11,650
To an idea that doesn't fit into the
prevailing paradigm,

1925
01:33:11,651 --> 01:33:13,750
but the other work,
the work in south America,

1926
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,530
the bluefish quays work,
that's really not controversial anymore.

1927
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:21,310
It's very widely accepted.
Clovis first is a discredited and

1928
01:33:21,311 --> 01:33:25,870
abandoned position and I have something
else to asK you actually concerning

1929
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:28,750
genetics and dna.
I'm sure you're well up on that.

1930
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:32,350
I mean,
can you explain why we have a strong

1931
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:37,351
Signal of denisovan dna in certain
groups of south american indians and in

1932
01:33:37,811 --> 01:33:42,430
australian aborigines and melanesians,
but that denisovan dna doesn't crop up

1933
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:43,780
in north american indians.

1934
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:46,060
How would we explain that if they all
came through the bering strait?

1935
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,380
I have no idea.
Well,

1936
01:33:47,381 --> 01:33:49,540
it could be both,
but I mean this just happens to be

1937
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,100
something I don't know anything about.
Okay.

1938
01:33:51,130 --> 01:33:54,430
So part of the problem and if even doing
this is that was your idea.

1939
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,310
Well here we are talking.
This is good,

1940
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,790
but part of the risk is that you're
going to find something I don't happen

1941
01:34:00,791 --> 01:34:01,930
to know about.
And then it's like,

1942
01:34:01,990 --> 01:34:04,720
you see,
I made my point what point that.

1943
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:08,140
Okay,
so in like the history of the people of

1944
01:34:08,170 --> 01:34:09,520
America that,
that area,

1945
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:12,010
uh,
there's always somebody that comes in

1946
01:34:12,011 --> 01:34:13,780
with,
it's not clovis,

1947
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:14,710
it's this,
it's that.

1948
01:34:14,711 --> 01:34:19,300
And rarely do they last why the dates
were miscalibrated or whatever.

1949
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:21,520
It's not just thAt scientists are closed
minded,

1950
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:24,910
although they can be,
it's that the convergence of evidence

1951
01:34:24,911 --> 01:34:27,640
iSn't strong enough to overturn the
mainstream theory.

1952
01:34:28,090 --> 01:34:28,720
So,
but,

1953
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,280
but it does happen.
Uh,

1954
01:34:30,281 --> 01:34:32,410
you know,
maybe there are multiple migrations into

1955
01:34:32,411 --> 01:34:34,570
north America and we just don't have all
the sites,

1956
01:34:35,050 --> 01:34:38,140
but when somebody comes up with a site
like that's tens of thousands of years

1957
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:42,790
earlier than all the others that are
accepted here and it's over here where

1958
01:34:42,791 --> 01:34:45,100
all the sites in between.
Whereas it's like the gap,

1959
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:48,220
the 5,000 year gap with the egyptian
complex.

1960
01:34:48,490 --> 01:34:50,230
Where are the sites?
If it's true,

1961
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:54,580
we didn't fly it here so I had to get
there and there must be a trail,

1962
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:56,590
you know,
somewhere that we could find it unless

1963
01:34:56,591 --> 01:34:59,480
they came by boat.
And then that's evidence is done unless

1964
01:34:59,481 --> 01:35:02,870
you're dealing with 24,000 years ago and
there's not much evidence to find that

1965
01:35:02,871 --> 01:35:05,420
navy,
but if they came by boat and that

1966
01:35:05,421 --> 01:35:08,120
clearly implies the head navigational
skills,

1967
01:35:08,121 --> 01:35:12,190
they had the ability to build boats and,
and you know,

1968
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:13,800
find your way across the ocean.

1969
01:35:14,580 --> 01:35:17,270
You could do the coast that,
that's not quite as,

1970
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:20,090
you don't need a big ocean going,
but you know,

1971
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:23,740
you don't need an ocean going.
But hypothesis that you know,

1972
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,600
that's proposed is that they came across
by,

1973
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:28,430
uh,
by boat just following the shore.

1974
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,190
You just same area as the bering strait.
Yeah,

1975
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,480
you're just 100 feet off shore.
You go in and,

1976
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,221
and,
and,

1977
01:35:33,221 --> 01:35:34,880
uh,
most likely both.

1978
01:35:34,881 --> 01:35:37,610
Right?
And one of the issues of course was the

1979
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,020
short face bear was so formidable
according to dan flores,

1980
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:43,610
that it would have been a huge
impediment for people crossing on foot

1981
01:35:43,611 --> 01:35:47,990
anyway.
And short face bear went extinct right

1982
01:35:47,991 --> 01:35:50,900
around tHe time we see more evidence of
human beings entering in.

1983
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:53,420
But why did it go extinct?
That's the big question.

1984
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:55,050
Well,
you have to add that to the list of of

1985
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:58,460
predators that there would've been no
reason for humans to have been hunting.

1986
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,030
Yeah.
Well,

1987
01:35:59,030 --> 01:36:02,510
that's an enormous,
enormous animals to factors that go on

1988
01:36:02,511 --> 01:36:04,520
here.
There's positive evidence in favor of a

1989
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:07,310
hypothesis.
Then there's negative evidence against

1990
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,220
the mainstreams hypothesis and you
really need both,

1991
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:15,020
so it's not enough to just say,
I don't accept the evidence for here

1992
01:36:15,021 --> 01:36:15,441
that,
okay,

1993
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:16,940
that's fine.
So I just do that all the time.

1994
01:36:17,030 --> 01:36:17,940
What evidence?
What do you.

1995
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:20,120
Let's be,
let's be speak in specifics because you

1996
01:36:20,121 --> 01:36:21,560
keep doing this.
You keep saying,

1997
01:36:21,561 --> 01:36:22,940
well,
they find things and it turns out no,

1998
01:36:22,941 --> 01:36:25,190
that's not true.
When you're essentially proving your

1999
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:28,190
point of being a skeptic without having
any real cases.

2000
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:30,180
Well and just keep saying that all of
the cases,

2001
01:36:30,710 --> 01:36:32,420
but no,
you're not saying you can't say all the

2002
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:34,400
cases.
If you don't want to cite anything

2003
01:36:34,401 --> 01:36:36,740
specifically,
don't keep bringing up things that are

2004
01:36:36,741 --> 01:36:39,110
refuted because you don't have anything
that you're pointing to,

2005
01:36:39,260 --> 01:36:40,910
so you're just muddying the water.

2006
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:42,770
Okay.
You're essentially pissing in the pool.

2007
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,270
None of the clovis thing.
For example,

2008
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:47,810
go back to the pyramids.
All of these,

2009
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,090
what's been disproved?
Okay,

2010
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,650
I'm making a different slightly
different point.

2011
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:55,610
That's the problem that you're not
addressing the actual issues we're

2012
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:58,490
talking about.
You muddy the water by saying things

2013
01:36:58,491 --> 01:37:02,240
have been tossed out the window,
so we have to be careful here and tossed

2014
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:04,310
these things out the window as well that
toss out.

2015
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:08,090
Just contemplate them published in
nature for example,

2016
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,840
so let's watch what happens to the
hundred and 30,000 year old hypothesis

2017
01:37:11,870 --> 01:37:15,920
if it if it holds up and there's other
sites that are dated that way and so on

2018
01:37:15,921 --> 01:37:19,430
and so forth,
and that will be truly revolutionary and

2019
01:37:19,431 --> 01:37:20,420
scientists would accept it.

2020
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,780
You see,
the problem is that when you have a very

2021
01:37:22,781 --> 01:37:26,260
strong paradigm like clovis first,
which really dominates american

2022
01:37:26,261 --> 01:37:28,570
archeology,
prehistoric archeology for very long

2023
01:37:28,571 --> 01:37:30,940
period,
it's difficult.

2024
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,720
It's difficult from a career point of
view for archeologist to come up and

2025
01:37:34,721 --> 01:37:38,200
proposal attentive sites.
Those who did like tom dillehay let jack

2026
01:37:38,201 --> 01:37:41,350
sunk.
Mars paid a very heavy price for so

2027
01:37:41,351 --> 01:37:44,280
doing so.
The incentive to go looking for older

2028
01:37:44,281 --> 01:37:48,550
stuff than clovis is extremely low.
In the archaeological community as a

2029
01:37:48,551 --> 01:37:53,551
result of this ferocious reaction that
went on for 30 or 40 or even 50 years,

2030
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:57,240
you know,
I mean can also considered the vasa kilo

2031
01:37:58,420 --> 01:37:59,410
excavations in,
in,

2032
01:37:59,430 --> 01:38:00,740
in Mexico,
uh,

2033
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:03,210
where,
where the suggestion of some sort of

2034
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:06,630
human presence 230,000 years ago,
I mean that good archeology,

2035
01:38:06,631 --> 01:38:10,170
but it was utterly dismissed and the
archeologists involved where were ruined

2036
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,440
for getting involved in that.
It's hard to see how that's a profession

2037
01:38:13,441 --> 01:38:18,441
that encourages people to think outside
the box when careers get ruined and

2038
01:38:18,481 --> 01:38:22,440
research funding gets withdrawn for an
idea that doesn't fit the current

2039
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:23,274
mainstream.

2040
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:25,500
We don't like to think that,
that scientists do that.

2041
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,180
They do that.
Are you familiar with michael kramer's

2042
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:30,270
book for bitten archeology?
I know michael.

2043
01:38:30,271 --> 01:38:31,050
Yeah.
Okay.

2044
01:38:31,050 --> 01:38:36,050
So now he makes in my mind as compelling
a case as you do and for his humans were

2045
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:42,990
here tens of millions of years ago.
And his book is young,

2046
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:45,130
900 pages long,
tens of millions,

2047
01:38:45,140 --> 01:38:46,500
yet tens of millions.
Okay.

2048
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:49,300
And he's a hindu.
So his ideas,

2049
01:38:49,310 --> 01:38:52,080
you know,
this sort of long recycling and what

2050
01:38:52,081 --> 01:38:55,920
evidence is it based on for tens of
millions of years not here to defend

2051
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:58,740
michael kremer or to have a discussion
about michael kremer.

2052
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,280
That's not why I'm sitting at this
table,

2053
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,150
but my point is that michael primo is
not me.

2054
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:04,560
That's right.
So,

2055
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,510
but,
but there's lots of alternative

2056
01:39:06,511 --> 01:39:09,630
archeology was where I began.
There's lots of alternative archeology

2057
01:39:09,631 --> 01:39:12,810
books and what evidence is there to
support that?

2058
01:39:12,870 --> 01:39:15,030
None.
So why you bringing up that when there's

2059
01:39:15,031 --> 01:39:18,750
evidence that he's bringing up corrimos
evidence is similar to his.

2060
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:21,690
It's mostly negative evidence that I
don't accept the data.

2061
01:39:21,691 --> 01:39:25,290
This,
there is this peculiar sort of footprint

2062
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:26,124
looking thing.

2063
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:28,920
Kramer refers specifically to the
knowledge filter.

2064
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:33,060
The most useful thing about that book is
the publication of reports,

2065
01:39:33,061 --> 01:39:33,720
archeological surgical

2066
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:35,880
reports which are no longer available to
the public,

2067
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,770
which,
which do suggest an alternative.

2068
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:40,590
But I would say it's a very useful book
to read beyond that.

2069
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:41,690
I have nothing to say about.
Right.

2070
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:44,250
So,
but that's not necessarily true.

2071
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:48,180
You're saying his only evidence.
We mean he's pointing to like some

2072
01:39:48,181 --> 01:39:52,560
pretty significant evidence like this.
The sphinx thing is a geologist from

2073
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:56,640
boston university propose this because
of water erosion because of water

2074
01:39:56,641 --> 01:40:00,000
erosion that could have only been done
by thousands of years of rainfall in his

2075
01:40:00,001 --> 01:40:03,930
opinion as a,
as a qualified geologists and like

2076
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:05,850
that's not a lack of evidence.
I understand,

2077
01:40:05,851 --> 01:40:09,470
but why do no,
no other geologists archaeologists

2078
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:10,441
other.
No,

2079
01:40:10,441 --> 01:40:13,290
that's not true.
Actually they do and I've had multiple

2080
01:40:13,291 --> 01:40:17,680
conversations with robert where he is
cited the fact that he has gotten a

2081
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:20,280
considerable body of support from other
geologists,

2082
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:25,310
not from egyptologist,
but from geologists who do recognize the

2083
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:29,370
effects of severe water erosion on
limestone carbonate rocks,

2084
01:40:29,371 --> 01:40:32,250
and that's what we have there.
We have severe water erosion,

2085
01:40:32,251 --> 01:40:36,060
it appears and is preserved on the
quarry walls around the sphinx.

2086
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:37,770
The sphinx itself,
as graham said,

2087
01:40:37,771 --> 01:40:42,570
is difficult to ascertain because of all
of the reconstruction that has gone on,

2088
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,320
but the quarry walls,
which would have once had the very

2089
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:50,250
distinct stepped profile of a typical
quarry.

2090
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:53,980
I'm no longer have that.
I mean they have now they have a

2091
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:58,060
textbook profile,
a parabolic profile that would be

2092
01:40:58,061 --> 01:41:02,110
consistent with sheet flooding,
which would be both disillusioned

2093
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:07,140
because carbonate rocks dissolve in
acidic waters and what's called

2094
01:41:07,601 --> 01:41:12,460
courageous,
which was be the effects of water loaded

2095
01:41:12,461 --> 01:41:16,000
with sand sediment,
which would make it very rough,

2096
01:41:16,001 --> 01:41:20,920
so if you've got the sand sediment
flowing over the edge of what would have

2097
01:41:20,921 --> 01:41:23,830
been a quarry wall,
what you're going to end up with is a

2098
01:41:23,831 --> 01:41:28,831
smoothing off of the rough corners and
the final result would be a a very

2099
01:41:29,441 --> 01:41:33,820
rounded profile like you see there and
you would also see where the fissures in

2100
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:38,020
the rock would be selectively widened
and opened by the water penetrating

2101
01:41:38,021 --> 01:41:39,190
those fissures.
I mean it,

2102
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:44,220
it has all the earmarks of a very
textbook case of water erosion.

2103
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:47,670
Don't you think?
It's very diSingenuous comparing that to

2104
01:41:47,671 --> 01:41:50,880
someone who thinks that human beings
have been here for tens of millions of

2105
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,710
years with no evidence to support it
whatsoever.

2106
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:55,530
He doesn't say he.
Of course he doesn't say he has no

2107
01:41:55,531 --> 01:41:58,590
evidence.
He has a 900 page book full of evidence.

2108
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:02,250
It's the quality of the evidence.
What about the quality of that evidence?

2109
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:05,630
It's okay if it was that good.
You know,

2110
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:07,380
we're not geologist sitting here.
If it was that good,

2111
01:42:07,381 --> 01:42:08,610
why don't geologists look at it?
Go.

2112
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:11,700
He's right.
They do.

2113
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,593
They all do.

2114
01:42:12,740 --> 01:42:14,970
No.
Some geologists who,

2115
01:42:14,990 --> 01:42:18,240
some geologists who work with
egyptologists say that shock is right.

2116
01:42:18,490 --> 01:42:20,620
We have a geologist on the line.
Why don't we ask him,

2117
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,830
mark will.
We can have one guy's opinion.

2118
01:42:23,831 --> 01:42:25,390
We could also have other guys' opinions

2119
01:42:25,610 --> 01:42:28,220
and get this matter has been in what
domain?

2120
01:42:28,221 --> 01:42:31,880
Since 1992.
It hasn't gone away.

2121
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:35,810
Sharks argument that we are looking at
precipitation induced weathering on the

2122
01:42:35,811 --> 01:42:39,530
sphinx has not been debunked.
It has been opposed.

2123
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:42,860
It has been disagreed With,
but that is different from saying it's

2124
01:42:42,861 --> 01:42:46,640
deBunked and shock stays solid and
strong on that issue.

2125
01:42:46,641 --> 01:42:49,460
He is a credentialed geologist.
He is a professor of geology at the

2126
01:42:49,461 --> 01:42:52,580
university of boston.
He has a right to speak out about this,

2127
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:55,910
and he stated his view.
I happened to find this view very

2128
01:42:55,911 --> 01:42:59,660
interesting,
especially since it correlates with what

2129
01:42:59,661 --> 01:43:02,060
I regard as the interesting astronomy of
the site.

2130
01:43:02,061 --> 01:43:06,650
I think that site has origins that do go
back into the younger dryas.

2131
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:10,370
That's my opinion.
I've stayed at many times and I've

2132
01:43:10,371 --> 01:43:13,580
presented the evidence that I think
underwrites that opinion.

2133
01:43:13,581 --> 01:43:16,460
You and your colleagues are absolutely
at liberty to disagree and you do.

2134
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:19,400
You don't think it's disingenuous to
compare that to someone who says

2135
01:43:19,401 --> 01:43:22,960
something that defies our current
understanding of human beings and the

2136
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:23,360
the,
the,

2137
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:26,680
the actual evolution of humans.
But you're talking about someone who's

2138
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:29,090
saying that human beings,
how many millions of years old,

2139
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:30,860
tens of millions.
Tens of millions.

2140
01:43:30,861 --> 01:43:32,210
Well,
we know for a fact,

2141
01:43:32,211 --> 01:43:34,280
right?
As far if you pay attention evolution.

2142
01:43:34,281 --> 01:43:37,270
Right,
but that's what we weren't even humans a

2143
01:43:37,410 --> 01:43:38,540
million years ago.
Correct.

2144
01:43:38,541 --> 01:43:40,310
I meAn,
there are creationists who think,

2145
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:41,810
okay,
we're not talking about them.

2146
01:43:41,811 --> 01:43:43,260
We're talking about grandma.
I know,

2147
01:43:43,490 --> 01:43:46,370
but my point was that,
so here you have the mainstream

2148
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:48,370
scientists.
There's graham.

2149
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:51,560
He seemed so reasonable,
but there's 50 him

2150
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:54,290
and each of them thinks that they're
there.

2151
01:43:54,291 --> 01:43:55,124
Right?
They're not

2152
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:57,260
visual language.
he seems so reasonable.

2153
01:43:57,470 --> 01:43:58,320
Right?
So you're right there.

2154
01:43:58,350 --> 01:44:02,780
You're accusing me of dissimulation.
The subtext is that I'm not.

2155
01:44:02,781 --> 01:44:06,350
And then there's 50 patronized,
arrogant.

2156
01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:08,930
I don't mean deeply unpleasant and
personal approach.

2157
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:10,120
I'm sorry I didn't.

2158
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:11,740
I mean it to sound like that.
I really don't.

2159
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,511
Okay.
Okay.

2160
01:44:13,511 --> 01:44:18,511
I have a larger point that you accepted
that when you're faced with a bunch of

2161
01:44:19,661 --> 01:44:22,990
different alternative theories that are
coming in and it's not safe to take

2162
01:44:22,991 --> 01:44:25,210
physics.
I mean every physicist like you just had

2163
01:44:25,211 --> 01:44:28,090
lawrence krauss,
he gets these letters daily of people

2164
01:44:28,091 --> 01:44:30,340
saying,
I think I figured out why einstein was

2165
01:44:30,341 --> 01:44:33,210
wrong and he can't address them all.
And,

2166
01:44:33,211 --> 01:44:34,750
and,
and they're smart people.

2167
01:44:34,751 --> 01:44:36,610
They're thoughtful people.
They really believe it.

2168
01:44:37,150 --> 01:44:38,020
What do you do with that?

2169
01:44:39,270 --> 01:44:41,310
That's my point and I feel that's not my
problem.

2170
01:44:41,311 --> 01:44:44,130
And if there are alternative,
the other alternative theories,

2171
01:44:44,131 --> 01:44:46,400
that's not my problem either.
It's the problem for the mainstream to

2172
01:44:46,401 --> 01:44:48,390
sort it out and figure which to pay
attention to in which,

2173
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:51,420
well,
I'm suspicious of this whole idea of the

2174
01:44:51,421 --> 01:44:54,350
mainstream because even looking into
mainstream,

2175
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:57,330
you find so many divergent points of
view that I,

2176
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:00,030
you know,
I think that's basically a fiction that

2177
01:45:00,031 --> 01:45:04,320
there is this mainstream that has
arrived at this consensus and that there

2178
01:45:04,321 --> 01:45:09,321
are no alternative ulterior motives
there and that there are no dogmas that

2179
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:14,270
are being perpetuated there.
you know,

2180
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,620
I mean,
I look at the lot of the geological

2181
01:45:16,621 --> 01:45:21,090
stuff in and realize that there are many
different points of view when we talk

2182
01:45:21,091 --> 01:45:23,880
about the,
these floods at the end of the last ice

2183
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,620
age.
There are many divergent points of view.

2184
01:45:25,950 --> 01:45:30,950
There is what could be considered the
mainstream yet even that has multiple

2185
01:45:31,921 --> 01:45:33,030
interpretations.

2186
01:45:33,390 --> 01:45:36,300
And the same with this common idea.
Um,

2187
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:37,081
you know,
I mean,

2188
01:45:37,081 --> 01:45:40,050
I don't know what constitutes the
mainstream there because there had been

2189
01:45:40,051 --> 01:45:42,090
a group that has opposed it at every
turn,

2190
01:45:42,091 --> 01:45:45,090
but at the same time,
the group that accepts the comment

2191
01:45:45,091 --> 01:45:47,200
hypothesis has continued to grow.
In fact,

2192
01:45:47,201 --> 01:45:50,670
there's even a number of,
of individuals involved that set out

2193
01:45:50,671 --> 01:45:54,960
specifically to to disprove it or
discredited who are now basically on

2194
01:45:54,961 --> 01:45:59,040
board and it has grown from being a
small handful of scientists that are now

2195
01:45:59,041 --> 01:46:04,041
63 scientists from 55 different
institutions that are on board with the

2196
01:46:04,561 --> 01:46:08,670
idea that something remarkable happened
at the end of the last ice age.

2197
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,300
It was probably exogenic meaning
something from outside,

2198
01:46:13,470 --> 01:46:18,090
something from space.
There's no consensus as to exactly what

2199
01:46:18,091 --> 01:46:20,640
that was,
which would be normal because the,

2200
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:23,370
these discoveries are in their infancy
at this point,

2201
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:27,720
but there's been an attempt to discredit
the idea simply because that as the

2202
01:46:27,721 --> 01:46:30,090
evidence has come in over the last
decade,

2203
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:33,420
it has evolved in,
in new mysteries have been opened up.

2204
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:36,330
Uh,
as the evidence comes in and the claim

2205
01:46:36,331 --> 01:46:40,650
is being made well,
there's no consistent interpretation of

2206
01:46:40,651 --> 01:46:43,410
this evidence and therefore we've
debunked it.

2207
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:45,580
I mean,
an example is pinta is rec.

2208
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:50,010
When pinterest dalton directly am for
the younger impact

2209
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:50,843
hypothesis.
I mean,

2210
01:46:50,950 --> 01:46:53,670
publish a paper in pen air saying
requiem,

2211
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,340
suggesting that the impact hypothesis is
already dead.

2212
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:59,670
That was in 2011.
Every single one of pinch points have

2213
01:46:59,671 --> 01:47:02,610
been responded to.
Those who are critical of the younger

2214
01:47:02,611 --> 01:47:07,290
dryas impact hypothesis rarely site.
The fact that the so called refutations

2215
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:10,260
have themselves been refuted.
That new information is constantly

2216
01:47:10,261 --> 01:47:14,010
coming in.
I see a very one sided game being played

2217
01:47:14,011 --> 01:47:18,690
here with a group of academics who are
determined to demonstrate that there

2218
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:23,430
could have been no possibility of
anything like a comet impact 12,800

2219
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:27,270
years ago and that these 63 or 65
scientists who are proposing that I just

2220
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:31,320
completely wrong and when they refute
the reputations,

2221
01:47:31,321 --> 01:47:34,680
I very rarely see though that that refer
to our commented upon a tall.

2222
01:47:34,681 --> 01:47:35,514
Again,
your,

2223
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:39,540
your colleague,
the defense has dismissed the younger

2224
01:47:39,541 --> 01:47:44,160
dryas impact hypothesis without actually
going in detail into the debate that's

2225
01:47:44,161 --> 01:47:44,620
gone on.

2226
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:49,620
Has this graph in his paper showing all
these different dates for the.

2227
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:53,760
That's from one of the critical papers.
You know there's another side to this

2228
01:47:53,761 --> 01:47:54,810
argument,
so it needs to be.

2229
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:56,850
It needs to be listening to what the
other side would say.

2230
01:47:56,851 --> 01:47:58,230
Well,
that's the point where maybe we should

2231
01:47:58,231 --> 01:48:02,520
have mark come on and maybe we should
have malcolm lecan come on as well

2232
01:48:02,521 --> 01:48:05,220
because malcolm,
the comp is actually one of those 63

2233
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,310
younger dryas impact scientists.
What is explained to me,

2234
01:48:08,311 --> 01:48:08,440
people

2235
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:10,950
that are just listening to this,
what is this graph that you're showing?

2236
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:15,630
Well,
this is the carbon 14 date ranges from

2237
01:48:15,631 --> 01:48:18,390
samples taken from the younger dryas
boundary.

2238
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:22,380
So this is the boundary here.
And the point of this is that there's

2239
01:48:22,381 --> 01:48:25,890
not a single consistent series of dates
that would consistently show.

2240
01:48:25,891 --> 01:48:26,730
Yep,
absolutely.

2241
01:48:26,731 --> 01:48:28,170
For sure.
At every site it comes in,

2242
01:48:28,171 --> 01:48:30,570
right there is that they bounce around a
lot here.

2243
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,420
So now maybe mark,
this is his area.

2244
01:48:33,720 --> 01:48:37,020
He could come on and skype here and they
bounce around and what's,

2245
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:39,450
what's the point of this for the lay
person who's listening to this?

2246
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:40,591
Uh,
well.

2247
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:43,290
So if you take the ones that are above
the gray line,

2248
01:48:43,670 --> 01:48:46,020
then those were,
those are showing that something like an

2249
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:50,370
impact happened much earlier,
much later and the ones below it or that

2250
01:48:50,371 --> 01:48:54,600
it's much earlier.
So where's the consistency of a single

2251
01:48:54,601 --> 01:48:57,330
impact consistent across that middle of
that group?

2252
01:48:57,340 --> 01:48:59,910
I don't think there's any argument.
There was a single impact.

2253
01:48:59,911 --> 01:49:00,711
In fact,
there's a.

2254
01:49:00,711 --> 01:49:03,990
There's arguments that there was no,
there's more than one day.

2255
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:07,740
We're talking about a stretch of
thousands of years and multiple impacts

2256
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:09,630
dress runs when random,
200 years.

2257
01:49:09,660 --> 01:49:10,493
Randall,
please,

2258
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,330
please give me your,
your [inaudible].

2259
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,880
You're the expert of this.
Well,

2260
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:18,930
these are dates for the younger dryas.
There's a big spread obviously,

2261
01:49:18,990 --> 01:49:23,990
but there's also a lot of possibilities
for introducing inaccuracies into the

2262
01:49:25,441 --> 01:49:27,480
dating.
The what's called the old wood effect

2263
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:32,510
can sometimes make,
make it appear to be older than it is by

2264
01:49:32,611 --> 01:49:36,450
a millennium or to millenium.
But what we certainly do see here is a

2265
01:49:36,451 --> 01:49:38,940
clustering right around 13,000 years
ago.

2266
01:49:38,941 --> 01:49:43,380
That looks pretty evident to me and
everybody knows who does radio carbon

2267
01:49:43,381 --> 01:49:46,890
dating,
dating might have errors.

2268
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:47,724
And

2269
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:50,080
in it,
the one article I think that came out

2270
01:49:50,081 --> 01:49:55,081
last year by james kenneth and 25 others
was the by asian chronological analysis

2271
01:49:55,301 --> 01:50:00,301
consistent with synchronous age of
12,835 to 12,735 calibrated years before

2272
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:04,900
present for younger dryas boundary on
four continents.

2273
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:07,720
That's a refutation of precisely what it
is.

2274
01:50:07,721 --> 01:50:11,080
It's a representation of this does not
refer to that reputation.

2275
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:15,250
Jamie,
could you pull up a the age of leo?

2276
01:50:16,390 --> 01:50:21,390
I think I gave that to you.
And go to slide number

2277
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:25,960
one.
60 seven.

2278
01:50:26,430 --> 01:50:28,960
Wow.
One hundred and 67.

2279
01:50:30,310 --> 01:50:35,260
And that that refers to the go to slide
167.

2280
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:40,530
Jesus,
you're not fucking around 167 slides.

2281
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:45,323
Here we go.

2282
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:50,900
Here we go.
A cosmic impact event at 12,800

2283
01:50:50,901 --> 01:50:54,410
calibrated years before present form the
younger dryas boundary layer containing

2284
01:50:54,411 --> 01:50:57,650
peak abundances in multiple high
temperature impact related proxies

2285
01:50:57,651 --> 01:50:58,610
including spirits,
milk,

2286
01:50:58,611 --> 01:51:02,720
glass and nano diamonds.
Bayesian statistical analysis of 354

2287
01:51:02,721 --> 01:51:05,510
dates from 23 sedimentary sequences over
four continents.

2288
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:10,670
Established a model younger dryas
boundary age of 12,835 calibrated years

2289
01:51:10,671 --> 01:51:13,340
before present,
supporting a synchronicity of the

2290
01:51:13,341 --> 01:51:15,860
younger dryas boundary layer at high
probability,

2291
01:51:15,861 --> 01:51:18,620
95 percent.
This range overlaps that have a platinum

2292
01:51:18,621 --> 01:51:22,280
peak recorded in the greenland ice sheet
to end of the onset of the younger dryas

2293
01:51:22,281 --> 01:51:25,670
climate episode in six.
Key records suggesting a causal

2294
01:51:25,671 --> 01:51:29,600
connection between the impact of and
younger dryas due to its rarity and

2295
01:51:29,601 --> 01:51:32,220
distinctive characteristics.
The younger dryas boundary layers

2296
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:34,700
proposed as a widespread correlation
data.

2297
01:51:35,540 --> 01:51:37,430
And randall,
if I can remember what you said

2298
01:51:37,431 --> 01:51:39,800
correctly,
you believe that there was probably more

2299
01:51:39,801 --> 01:51:43,880
than one significant impact over a
period of several thousand years.

2300
01:51:44,480 --> 01:51:45,950
Let me,
let me pop in on that

2301
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:47,850
clean.
I don't mean to cut you off,

2302
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:49,403
but the,
the,

2303
01:51:49,500 --> 01:51:50,860
the.
Let's be clear.

2304
01:51:51,250 --> 01:51:54,130
The suggestion is that 12,000,
800 years ago,

2305
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:57,160
uh,
there was a comments breakup into

2306
01:51:57,161 --> 01:51:58,030
multiple parts.
I mean,

2307
01:51:58,031 --> 01:52:03,031
anybody who saw the shoemaker levy nine
nasa films back in 1994 is aware that

2308
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:06,190
that comment broke up into more than 20
fragments,

2309
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:10,390
all of which hit jupiter.
Sometimes creating explosions larger

2310
01:52:10,391 --> 01:52:12,100
than the earth itself.
All right,

2311
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:14,980
so I don't think it's controversial that
comments break up into fragments and

2312
01:52:14,981 --> 01:52:18,190
this is the suggestion of the younger
dryas impact hypothesis that we're

2313
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:23,170
dealing with a giant comet that broke up
into multiple fragments that orbits in

2314
01:52:23,171 --> 01:52:26,650
the tour at media stream and that four
of those fragments,

2315
01:52:26,651 --> 01:52:30,940
that's the the the suggestion for
largest fragments fell out of the taurid

2316
01:52:30,941 --> 01:52:35,380
meteor stream coming in on a trajectory
roughly northwest to southeast crossing

2317
01:52:35,381 --> 01:52:39,100
the north american ice cap.
And there there are up to four impact on

2318
01:52:39,101 --> 01:52:40,680
the north american ice cap.
The,

2319
01:52:40,681 --> 01:52:40,991
the,
the,

2320
01:52:40,991 --> 01:52:43,840
the,
the impact is then continue across the

2321
01:52:43,841 --> 01:52:46,220
atlantic ocean.
There's a suggestion of impacts

2322
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:51,180
in Belgium and indeed as far east as aba
herrera in Syria,

2323
01:52:51,181 --> 01:52:52,430
it's a,
it's a global event.

2324
01:52:52,431 --> 01:52:56,750
Fifty dollars million square kilometers
of the earth's surfaces is within the

2325
01:52:56,751 --> 01:52:59,600
younger dryas boundary field.
And so he really huge thing.

2326
01:52:59,601 --> 01:53:02,210
So the suggestion is that there were
multiple impacts at the beginning.

2327
01:53:02,211 --> 01:53:04,820
Now the next question is what happened
11,000,

2328
01:53:04,821 --> 01:53:09,821
600 years ago when the younger dryas
ends and global temperatures shoot up

2329
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:13,340
incredibly rapidly.
And the science on that is much less

2330
01:53:13,341 --> 01:53:16,010
advanced than the science on the
beginning of the younger dryas.

2331
01:53:16,011 --> 01:53:20,870
Fred hoyle back in the 19 eighties,
was puzzled by the sudden temperature

2332
01:53:20,871 --> 01:53:22,850
increase at the end of the younger
dryas.

2333
01:53:22,851 --> 01:53:25,850
And he suggested presciently I would say
that,

2334
01:53:25,851 --> 01:53:28,010
uh,
this may have been caused by a comet

2335
01:53:28,011 --> 01:53:31,490
impact in an ocean,
so maybe other bits of the taurid meteor

2336
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:34,640
stream impacted the earth.
other filaments within the stream

2337
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,670
impacted the earth 11,000,
600 years ago,

2338
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:39,080
or maybe something else caused it.
I mean,

2339
01:53:39,081 --> 01:53:43,430
robert schoch is in favor of
extraordinary solar activity.

2340
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:46,100
Being responsible for that warming,
we don't have to know,

2341
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:49,640
but that that's broadly the suggestion.
We're at the beginning and the end that

2342
01:53:49,641 --> 01:53:52,670
certainly impacts at the beginning,
possibly impacts or other things at the,

2343
01:53:52,790 --> 01:53:53,150
at the end

2344
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:58,150
or club in napier and others don't.
Can in other astronomers have speculated

2345
01:53:58,431 --> 01:54:03,431
that there could be impact arrows epochs
in which there's a,

2346
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:07,640
an enhanced possibility of the earth
being impacted.

2347
01:54:07,820 --> 01:54:11,270
Particularly if you have a large comet
that enters into the solar system,

2348
01:54:11,630 --> 01:54:15,620
begins to undergo a hierarchy of
disintegrations and basically litters

2349
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:17,840
the inner solar system with the
material.

2350
01:54:17,841 --> 01:54:21,710
And We do know that the earth crosses
the taurid meteor stream twice each

2351
01:54:21,710 --> 01:54:23,240
year,
once in late june,

2352
01:54:23,241 --> 01:54:26,420
and um,
once in late october,

2353
01:54:26,421 --> 01:54:30,230
early november.
And we know that the tongue cusco event

2354
01:54:30,231 --> 01:54:31,070
of 19 oh,
eight,

2355
01:54:31,071 --> 01:54:33,980
which is not speculative,
I mean that happened.

2356
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,790
It occurred on June 30th,
which would have been the peak of the

2357
01:54:38,110 --> 01:54:40,760
meteor shower.
it also came from the direction of the

2358
01:54:40,761 --> 01:54:41,730
sun,
its,

2359
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:44,990
um,
its position in space where we're

2360
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:47,200
emanate.
It's radiant point in space from which

2361
01:54:47,201 --> 01:54:52,201
it laminated at that time was totally
consistent with the taurid meteor stream

2362
01:54:52,371 --> 01:54:53,180
radiant.

2363
01:54:53,180 --> 01:54:56,660
So it's very possible that the,
that the tone cusco event of 19,

2364
01:54:56,661 --> 01:54:59,360
oh,
eight was a member of that family of

2365
01:54:59,361 --> 01:55:01,090
media rights.
Um,

2366
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:02,900
and so,
you know,

2367
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,400
that would be,
again,

2368
01:55:04,401 --> 01:55:05,270
we don't,
there's no,

2369
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:08,300
nothing definitive there,
but it would be a prime candidate for

2370
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:11,570
investigation that perhaps,
and again I mentioned earlier,

2371
01:55:11,571 --> 01:55:15,050
this goes back to the work of fred
whipple way back in the 19 forties who

2372
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:19,730
began to research the target media
stream and came to believe that it was

2373
01:55:19,731 --> 01:55:21,760
much,
much more active in,

2374
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:25,820
in the past than it is now.
That it's an old diffuse meteor stream

2375
01:55:26,090 --> 01:55:31,090
that at one time and like graham said,
it has a multiple objects still within

2376
01:55:31,821 --> 01:55:32,654
it.

2377
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:35,960
KeY is the best known moment.
That's a fragment.

2378
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:41,180
Original original giant comet that they
estimate might've been based upon the

2379
01:55:41,851 --> 01:55:42,770
amount of materials

2380
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:49,160
remnant in the zodiacal light cloud that
perhaps it was somewhere around 60 miles

2381
01:55:50,911 --> 01:55:53,100
or 100 kilometers in diameter.

2382
01:55:53,680 --> 01:55:58,320
And another thing that I'm,
that I'm taken to task for is that I

2383
01:55:58,321 --> 01:56:02,340
report the work of cuban napier and
their suggested that the taurid meteor

2384
01:56:02,341 --> 01:56:06,180
stream is actually fucking dangerous and
that we should be paying attention to

2385
01:56:06,181 --> 01:56:08,070
it.
That it has been a hidden hand in human

2386
01:56:08,071 --> 01:56:11,400
history in the past.
And that it can cause us trouble in the

2387
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:13,230
future.
Now this is not gloom and doom.

2388
01:56:13,560 --> 01:56:17,760
We have the technology to deal with the
large objects in the taurid meteor

2389
01:56:17,761 --> 01:56:19,660
stream.
If any filaments are on earth,

2390
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:23,400
an orbit that will result in impacts on
the earth at the very least.

2391
01:56:23,401 --> 01:56:25,580
It's extremely unwise of us not to pay
attention to.

2392
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:28,860
I'm accused of being sort of a do monger
and constantly predicting the end of the

2393
01:56:28,861 --> 01:56:31,530
world and this and that.
But actually I'm simply reporting

2394
01:56:31,531 --> 01:56:34,950
astronomers who are very concerned about
the tour with meteor stream and the

2395
01:56:34,951 --> 01:56:38,760
possibility that we may face further
impacts from it in the future.

2396
01:56:38,761 --> 01:56:41,310
That's not wool wool.
That is science,

2397
01:56:41,311 --> 01:56:41,620
you know?

2398
01:56:41,620 --> 01:56:43,460
Absolutely.
And I would agree with that and that.

2399
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:48,600
And that is a form of catastrophic ism
that scientists accept as a very real

2400
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:51,370
well lots.
I mean there's,

2401
01:56:51,371 --> 01:56:52,151
you know,
what,

2402
01:56:52,151 --> 01:56:54,220
if anything,
do you oppose about what they've just

2403
01:56:54,221 --> 01:56:55,054
said?
Nothing.

2404
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:57,160
Nothing.
Nothing about the younger dryas period

2405
01:56:57,161 --> 01:57:02,161
of just a technical question you had.
Your slide was 12,800 on there.

2406
01:57:02,831 --> 01:57:06,100
And so get directly.
Typically the end of the oldest c 14

2407
01:57:06,101 --> 01:57:11,101
dates or whatnot,
and 90 11,000 or 1200 year gap

2408
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:15,140
catastrophe.
No,

2409
01:57:15,210 --> 01:57:18,640
no.
Go back to the tend to be very clear

2410
01:57:18,670 --> 01:57:19,503
about

2411
01:57:19,780 --> 01:57:22,720
the younger dryas.
One of the puzzling things about it is

2412
01:57:22,721 --> 01:57:27,070
that you have cataclysm at the beginning
and this global temperature slump is

2413
01:57:27,100 --> 01:57:30,940
surely cataclysmic by any standards and
you have cataclysm at the end.

2414
01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:36,180
You have a massive spike,
a huge increase in global temperatures,

2415
01:57:36,940 --> 01:57:40,900
and you have meltwater pulse one b.
You have a lot of water going into the

2416
01:57:40,901 --> 01:57:43,540
ocean at that time.
So both ends of the younger dryas.

2417
01:57:43,541 --> 01:57:46,540
I cataclysmic and it's at the recent end
of the younger dryas,

2418
01:57:46,541 --> 01:57:50,320
11,600 years ago that we seek out
beckley tepi mysteriously

2419
01:57:50,320 --> 01:57:54,370
the popping up and I know you're a
staunch opponent of atlantis and that

2420
01:57:54,371 --> 01:57:57,580
you believe plato made atlantis up in
order to make a political point and you

2421
01:57:57,581 --> 01:58:00,310
may be right,
but the date that plato puts on the

2422
01:58:00,311 --> 01:58:02,980
submergence of atlantis is 11,600 years
ago,

2423
01:58:02,981 --> 01:58:06,550
9,000 years before the time of soul on
which happens to coincide with meltwater

2424
01:58:06,551 --> 01:58:08,830
pulse.
One b and the end of the younger dryas,

2425
01:58:08,831 --> 01:58:12,790
which I would have thought would cause
you to rethink your position on plato.

2426
01:58:12,791 --> 01:58:14,650
Just a Little.
Well,

2427
01:58:15,220 --> 01:58:17,710
it's interesting.
I'm open to the idea.

2428
01:58:17,950 --> 01:58:21,930
I tend to read myths in the same way
your guest Jordan Peterson does that,

2429
01:58:21,940 --> 01:58:24,400
you know,
it's a story to deliver some sort of

2430
01:58:24,401 --> 01:58:27,850
moral homily to is it's a commentary on
our own culture,

2431
01:58:27,860 --> 01:58:29,440
our society.
It's a way,

2432
01:58:29,441 --> 01:58:32,650
a literary way of delivering a message
to people.

2433
01:58:32,680 --> 01:58:35,410
That's how I tend to read.
Instead of reading them like let's see

2434
01:58:35,411 --> 01:58:37,330
if we can figure out what happened
historically,

2435
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:40,390
but those hard data,
hard data in plato's,

2436
01:58:40,870 --> 01:58:41,980
whatever you think it is and

2437
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:45,010
that hot data is data,
is that the submergence of atlanta's

2438
01:58:45,011 --> 01:58:50,011
happened 9,000 years before the time of
soul on that is a date that is 9,600 bc.

2439
01:58:50,201 --> 01:58:55,201
That is 11,600 years ago.
This to me is a strong reason why we

2440
01:58:55,331 --> 01:58:59,260
shouldn't just completely dismissed
plato's notion of a lost civilization of

2441
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:01,900
the idea.
I mean the idea that say the parting of

2442
01:59:01,901 --> 01:59:03,730
the red sea happened because of some
impact.

2443
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:05,680
That's not,
I'm not proposing that we don't go

2444
01:59:05,681 --> 01:59:07,120
there,
waste of time.

2445
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:07,730
Okay,
but,

2446
01:59:07,730 --> 01:59:11,650
but there are people that think that I
don't or or that the plagues in the

2447
01:59:11,651 --> 01:59:15,250
bible can be a waste of time,
but deal with plato.

2448
01:59:15,460 --> 01:59:16,180
Alright.
So,

2449
01:59:16,180 --> 01:59:19,680
but my point is that some of them may
have historical origins,

2450
01:59:19,681 --> 01:59:22,630
some of them may be completely made up
this mythic stories for some other

2451
01:59:22,631 --> 01:59:24,340
reason.
You have to take them one at a time,

2452
01:59:24,460 --> 01:59:25,630
in my opinion,
to plato.

2453
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:30,630
One is a commentary on his own culture
of athens and being too bellicose being

2454
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:34,780
too warlike and then this is not good
for where we're going.

2455
01:59:34,810 --> 01:59:38,230
That's my opinion.
and the fact that he picks a date that

2456
01:59:38,231 --> 01:59:42,880
coincides with the geologically
significant date of flooding is not

2457
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,710
really going to change your opinion.
I think.

2458
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:45,730
Well,
I think again,

2459
01:59:45,731 --> 01:59:48,670
that's pretty amazing coincidence is it?
I mean,

2460
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,040
we're finding that connection that
plato,

2461
01:59:51,970 --> 01:59:56,970
plato said that was an advanced
civilization with advanced agriculture,

2462
01:59:57,640 --> 02:00:01,570
advanced architecture,
advanced navigational abilities which

2463
02:00:01,571 --> 02:00:05,290
was submerged by the sea,
swept from the face of the earth so that

2464
02:00:05,291 --> 02:00:09,220
mankind had to begin again,
like children with no memory of what

2465
02:00:09,221 --> 02:00:10,810
went before.
And lo and behold,

2466
02:00:11,050 --> 02:00:14,500
he puts a Geologically significant data
on that date that we ourselves have only

2467
02:00:14,501 --> 02:00:16,690
known as significant in the last 20 or
30 years.

2468
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:20,650
So where is this place?

2469
02:00:20,710 --> 02:00:22,030
This atlantis?
I mean,

2470
02:00:22,031 --> 02:00:23,640
so as you know,
there's online problem,

2471
02:00:23,641 --> 02:00:25,210
there's a,
there's a long history of people

2472
02:00:25,211 --> 02:00:29,170
speculating.
If we found a site that would be a big

2473
02:00:29,171 --> 02:00:31,060
plus,
go do more marine archeology.

2474
02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:32,890
Well if we,
if we take it literally,

2475
02:00:32,891 --> 02:00:35,980
obviously then it's below the ocean.
But you know,

2476
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:38,680
I don't necessarily take plato's account
literally,

2477
02:00:38,681 --> 02:00:39,730
but I do say,
well,

2478
02:00:39,731 --> 02:00:43,990
it's rather coincidental that he,
his dating falls exactly on meltwater

2479
02:00:43,991 --> 02:00:47,710
pulse one b when we know there was this
huge influx of water into the ocean.

2480
02:00:47,770 --> 02:00:49,360
And also,
if we look at the,

2481
02:00:49,570 --> 02:00:50,830
his geography,
it,

2482
02:00:50,831 --> 02:00:54,250
it's interesting because he cites,
you know,

2483
02:00:54,251 --> 02:00:57,440
basically a landmass west of the pillars
of police,

2484
02:00:57,490 --> 02:01:00,520
which is pillars of hercules,
the straits of gibraltar,

2485
02:01:01,090 --> 02:01:04,290
and he places this in centrally
intermittent atlantic.

2486
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:06,040
Um,
I tHink it was cramped or one of the

2487
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:09,180
comp the,
the commentators on,

2488
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:12,550
on him that said it was something like
three or four days say a west.

2489
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:17,350
But if you look there,
there is a sunken landmass that sank at

2490
02:01:17,351 --> 02:01:20,590
the end of the last ice age because of
the rapidly rising sea level.

2491
02:01:20,591 --> 02:01:25,530
And this has been well established by
marine geology looking at evidence that,

2492
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:29,680
that the [inaudible] plateau underwent
an isostatic subsidence which would have

2493
02:01:29,681 --> 02:01:32,860
been resulting from the rapidly rising
sea level.

2494
02:01:32,861 --> 02:01:37,861
We know there's no doubt that the north
american continent has rebounded iso

2495
02:01:38,521 --> 02:01:40,130
statically after the removal of

2496
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:44,420
this tremendous mass of ice that,
that mantle north America up to anywhere

2497
02:01:44,421 --> 02:01:47,690
from a thousand to possibly 1500 feet.
Well,

2498
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:50,840
if you,
if you do a comparable isostatic

2499
02:01:50,841 --> 02:01:55,841
adjustment of the mid atlantic ridge,
you'll find that the asrs island complex

2500
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:57,260
are much,
much larger.

2501
02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:00,830
And it turns out that that might
actually be a nice place to develop a

2502
02:02:00,910 --> 02:02:04,340
least a maritime culture.
Something along the lines of the

2503
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:07,880
phoenicians are the minoans during the
period of the ice age.

2504
02:02:07,881 --> 02:02:11,660
Because during the period of the ash,
the climate of the world was so much

2505
02:02:11,661 --> 02:02:16,661
different than now know the great basin
area was filled with huge lakes

2506
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:20,090
vegetation,
forest,

2507
02:02:20,091 --> 02:02:23,030
savannah and grasslands,
like graham said,

2508
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:27,560
with the lowered sea level,
there were a much larger areas of the

2509
02:02:27,561 --> 02:02:29,850
coastline your were exposed.
Um,

2510
02:02:30,110 --> 02:02:32,480
and that's probably where most of
people,

2511
02:02:32,481 --> 02:02:35,180
what resided during the ice ages near
the coast lines,

2512
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:39,320
because that would have been the most
benevolent place with the rising of the

2513
02:02:39,321 --> 02:02:39,800
sea level.

2514
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:42,650
All of that's lost.
And there's nothing really fringed about

2515
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:43,071
saying,
well,

2516
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:46,460
people might have lived on islands in
the mid atlantic,

2517
02:02:46,461 --> 02:02:50,900
especially when we know that the,
that those islands most likely had a,

2518
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:54,780
a benevolent climate during the ice age.
So I,

2519
02:02:54,781 --> 02:02:59,300
I don't go into crystal technology and
flying machines or whatever,

2520
02:02:59,301 --> 02:03:02,210
all of this speculative stuff that has
created to it.

2521
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:05,030
But if we just keep it simple and say,
well,

2522
02:03:05,630 --> 02:03:09,370
is it possible that a culture along the
lines of the minoans or the finish

2523
02:03:09,390 --> 02:03:13,490
[inaudible] could have existed?
Could they have existed on an island

2524
02:03:13,491 --> 02:03:15,980
culture and admitted atlantic?
And there's nothing really

2525
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:21,050
extreme about that idea in my mind.

2526
02:03:21,180 --> 02:03:25,070
Even the idea that a more advanced,
sophisticated technological

2527
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:30,360
technological culture coexisted with
hunter gatherers isn't too strange.

2528
02:03:30,370 --> 02:03:34,020
I mean sanctuary do.
So today we coexist with hunter

2529
02:03:34,021 --> 02:03:37,080
gatherers in the amazon jungle who don't
even know we exist.

2530
02:03:37,081 --> 02:03:39,000
I mean,
so I don't see.

2531
02:03:39,001 --> 02:03:42,060
I don't see why a priority.
That's just an impossible idea to look

2532
02:03:42,130 --> 02:03:45,930
my misremembering that you in your book,
you mentioned Indonesia as a site for

2533
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:47,550
atlantis.
I mentioned,

2534
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:50,160
I mentioned gunung padang,
not as a site for atlantis.

2535
02:03:50,161 --> 02:03:53,610
That's danny hilman nutter with Georgia
who is a geologist,

2536
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:57,270
is indonesia's leading expert in
megathrust earthquakes.

2537
02:03:57,271 --> 02:04:00,480
As a matter of fact,
he has written a book proposing that

2538
02:04:00,481 --> 02:04:03,750
Indonesia was atlantis and the gunung
padang,

2539
02:04:03,751 --> 02:04:05,970
which he's been involved in
investigating a,

2540
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:09,690
is a site of fromm atlantean times danny
has done.

2541
02:04:09,691 --> 02:04:10,501
He has proposed that.
Now,

2542
02:04:10,501 --> 02:04:15,501
what's interesting about Indonesia is
that Indonesia sits upon the sunda shelf

2543
02:04:16,110 --> 02:04:20,010
and the sunda shelf was one of the parts
of the world that was most massively

2544
02:04:20,011 --> 02:04:22,320
flooded at the end of the ice age mean
if you go back to the end of the.

2545
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,690
I sAid you're not looking at the
malaysian peninsula,

2546
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:27,660
you're not looking at the indonesian
islands out going out towards the

2547
02:04:27,661 --> 02:04:29,790
Philippines.
You're looking at a giant continent

2548
02:04:29,791 --> 02:04:33,900
sized landmass,
all of which went a underwater at the

2549
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,340
end of the last ice age really rather
rapidly.

2550
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:36,340
So,
uh,

2551
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:38,130
I think he has a,
I think it's an interesting.

2552
02:04:38,131 --> 02:04:41,520
It's one of those areas in the world
where there was very large scale

2553
02:04:41,521 --> 02:04:44,070
flooding,
huge amounts of land were swallowed up.

2554
02:04:44,130 --> 02:04:47,100
Also,
the connection of Australia to new

2555
02:04:47,101 --> 02:04:49,440
Guinea during the ice age was also
washed away.

2556
02:04:49,441 --> 02:04:49,950
There's,
there's,

2557
02:04:49,950 --> 02:04:54,270
there's a whole range of issues
regarding sea level rise in that very

2558
02:04:54,271 --> 02:04:57,090
area which anybody with an interest in
these subjects should be paying

2559
02:04:57,091 --> 02:04:59,400
attention to.
so it's quite possible that,

2560
02:04:59,401 --> 02:05:00,710
like today,
many of them,

2561
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,500
van civilizations of today are on the
water,

2562
02:05:03,501 --> 02:05:06,800
whether it's New York or los angeles.
And that was probably the case back

2563
02:05:06,801 --> 02:05:09,470
then,
and so the idea of atlanta's might not

2564
02:05:09,471 --> 02:05:13,490
have been about one particular area,
but many advanced areas that were wiped

2565
02:05:13,491 --> 02:05:15,310
out along with their knowledge.
YeAh.

2566
02:05:15,630 --> 02:05:19,940
So the thesis of that book,
I mentioned noah's flood,

2567
02:05:19,941 --> 02:05:22,010
that the two geologIsts with the black
seat,

2568
02:05:22,011 --> 02:05:27,011
the theory that there were rimmed with
small villages and the massive flooding

2569
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:34,840
almost instantly wiped out and then that
gets passed down as the oral tradition

2570
02:05:35,241 --> 02:05:37,580
is these myths.
To me that's a totally reasonable,

2571
02:05:37,581 --> 02:05:38,910
totally reasonable.
Well,

2572
02:05:39,010 --> 02:05:42,630
when we get into more discussion about
the actual impact hypothesis and the

2573
02:05:42,640 --> 02:05:47,640
mega flooding so that we can get our
statement by gettIng them involved.

2574
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:49,660
What is your geologists?
You are geologists,

2575
02:05:49,740 --> 02:05:51,170
you're by yourself,
and there's two of them.

2576
02:05:51,980 --> 02:05:53,540
What is only fair,
right?

2577
02:05:53,810 --> 02:05:57,830
What is your geologists opposed to what
randall and grammar proposing?

2578
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:02,900
I think it's the On the impact
hypothesis versus the multiple glacial

2579
02:06:06,651 --> 02:06:10,700
dams that burst over periods of time
like that had that slide.

2580
02:06:11,750 --> 02:06:13,250
Okay.
Well let'S call him up and get him on

2581
02:06:13,251 --> 02:06:16,370
skype and we've never done tHis before,
so this might suck.

2582
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:18,500
Well,
hopefully it'll work.

2583
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:23,210
This slide here he is showing these are
each independent carbon,

2584
02:06:23,211 --> 02:06:28,211
14 dates of these different instant
floods in north America from each

2585
02:06:30,261 --> 02:06:33,140
individual ice dams.
And what separates these dates?

2586
02:06:33,800 --> 02:06:38,090
They're separated by,
it looks like from 20,000 to 12,000.

2587
02:06:38,091 --> 02:06:41,810
So all before the impact.
Well,

2588
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:45,680
12,800 wasn't that
marks on the line?

2589
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:48,290
What is this?
Mark would mark,

2590
02:06:48,360 --> 02:06:52,030
can you hear us
mark that mark defense.

2591
02:06:52,031 --> 02:06:55,250
Thank you very much for doing this.
We really appreciate you coming on here.

2592
02:06:55,950 --> 02:06:57,560
It's my pleasure.
Uh,

2593
02:06:57,561 --> 02:07:01,760
so you've had a chance to listen to
these guys talk.

2594
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:04,580
what is your thoughts just stepping into
this cold?

2595
02:07:05,640 --> 02:07:07,080
Well,
first of all,

2596
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:11,850
I did not mean to upset Mr. Hancock.
He seemed to be quite disturbed and I

2597
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:14,270
apologize it's not disturbed him.
No,

2598
02:07:14,280 --> 02:07:17,070
no you haven't.
You haven't disturbed me and I'm not,

2599
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:20,370
I'm not upset.
It's just simply that you're extremely

2600
02:07:20,371 --> 02:07:23,430
selective in what you present In your,
in your draft,

2601
02:07:23,431 --> 02:07:25,970
admittedly draft article that you've
chosen to put online.

2602
02:07:26,610 --> 02:07:27,990
Uh,
you don't represent.

2603
02:07:27,991 --> 02:07:31,950
You don't represent me accurately and
answer his question because I know we're

2604
02:07:31,951 --> 02:07:33,120
getting short on time.
Oh,

2605
02:07:33,121 --> 02:07:33,511
no,
no.

2606
02:07:33,511 --> 02:07:35,380
We're putting up plenty of time.
We have plenty of time.

2607
02:07:36,120 --> 02:07:37,300
Okay.
Well,

2608
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:38,740
first of all tonight,

2609
02:07:39,040 --> 02:07:41,890
would you allow me just to address a go
beckley,

2610
02:07:41,891 --> 02:07:42,730
tempe for a minute?

2611
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,610
Sure.
Would you like to address the article

2612
02:07:46,611 --> 02:07:49,190
first?
I think that probably would be the most

2613
02:07:49,191 --> 02:07:51,380
fair since we just brought that up.
Okay.

2614
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,500
I'm sorry,
what was the question then?

2615
02:07:53,980 --> 02:07:54,730
Graham?
Well,

2616
02:07:54,730 --> 02:07:55,440
the,
I,

2617
02:07:55,440 --> 02:08:00,440
I read that on their various passages in
your article where you misrepresent me.

2618
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:04,940
I'm sorry.
No,

2619
02:08:04,941 --> 02:08:07,610
I didn't rent misrepresenting.
You didn't misrepresent me.

2620
02:08:07,620 --> 02:08:08,453
okay.

2621
02:08:09,040 --> 02:08:10,600
You said that.
I did.

2622
02:08:10,630 --> 02:08:11,463
I said that,

2623
02:08:11,810 --> 02:08:12,910
uh,
uh,

2624
02:08:13,100 --> 02:08:16,910
that I was actually talking about
someone in Indonesia when I said you

2625
02:08:16,911 --> 02:08:19,520
didn't understand newton's physics.

2626
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:20,970
No,
I'm sorry.

2627
02:08:20,971 --> 02:08:23,010
I didn't say.
I didn't say you were talking about

2628
02:08:23,011 --> 02:08:25,140
someone in Indonesia.
I said you were talking about.

2629
02:08:25,141 --> 02:08:26,560
Hey susan.
Hey susan.

2630
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:29,310
Hey,
seuss gomorrah in,

2631
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:32,360
um,
in Peru is who I was talking about and

2632
02:08:32,361 --> 02:08:34,710
hey,
suze tamara does have very exotic views

2633
02:08:34,711 --> 02:08:37,380
on gravitation,
which I stayed seriously or not my

2634
02:08:37,381 --> 02:08:39,960
interest.
I do say he may be right,

2635
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:41,880
but I don't say he's right.
I say,

2636
02:08:41,881 --> 02:08:44,870
this is not my interest,
and I go onto say what my interest in

2637
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:46,820
his work.
You pick it back up.

2638
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:51,330
You're drowning me out here.
I was asked to explain whether or not I

2639
02:08:51,331 --> 02:08:55,230
thought I was misleading and I don't
think I was misleading.

2640
02:08:55,231 --> 02:09:00,231
You can clearly state in there that may
be gravity was due to the way we've

2641
02:09:00,601 --> 02:09:03,630
changed orbits around the sun.
Gravity is not due to that.

2642
02:09:03,631 --> 02:09:07,470
It's due to mass and the inverse

2643
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:09,940
of what?
What do you mean?

2644
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:11,110
I don't state that.
Hey,

2645
02:09:11,120 --> 02:09:14,290
sue states that and I say I disagree
with it.

2646
02:09:14,950 --> 02:09:16,060
Oh,
come on.

2647
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:20,410
I want to be respectful.
I can't really hear you when I'm

2648
02:09:20,411 --> 02:09:21,880
talking.
I apologize,

2649
02:09:22,420 --> 02:09:27,420
but I feel like you've.
You are selecting you selectively

2650
02:09:27,431 --> 02:09:29,560
changing the meaning of what I'm saying.

2651
02:09:30,150 --> 02:09:31,150
Well,
why don't you.

2652
02:09:31,151 --> 02:09:35,220
Why don't you quote me as these words
from my text what you say that I buy the

2653
02:09:35,221 --> 02:09:36,180
gravity thing of,
hey,

2654
02:09:36,181 --> 02:09:40,510
suze gomorrah,
why don't you quote me when I say the

2655
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:44,220
opposite of what I go on to say,
not quoted in the attack is the

2656
02:09:44,221 --> 02:09:45,720
following quote.
However,

2657
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:51,050
this isn't the part of his theory.
I'm interested in where I feel he is

2658
02:09:52,621 --> 02:09:57,240
solidly persuasive,
is in his observations of the anomalous

2659
02:09:57,241 --> 02:10:02,010
character of the monuments of the andes.
I am not putting anything on.

2660
02:10:02,011 --> 02:10:04,920
Hey,
suze gomorrah's gravitational ideas.

2661
02:10:05,220 --> 02:10:10,220
I am saying very clearly what it is in
his approach that I am interested in.

2662
02:10:10,651 --> 02:10:14,370
I'm not going to dismiss all of his
approach because he has an approach on

2663
02:10:14,371 --> 02:10:17,490
gravity that you don't like,
that's not even of interest to me,

2664
02:10:17,491 --> 02:10:19,980
and I say so in the book.
You don't report that.

2665
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:21,780
Therefore I suggest you misrepresented
me.

2666
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:27,730
Mr. Hancock.
What I brought up him for was simply

2667
02:10:27,880 --> 02:10:31,780
state that you didn't understand,
and I say it right there.

2668
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:33,920
Did you don't understand newton's
physics,

2669
02:10:33,950 --> 02:10:34,040
but

2670
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:37,730
I'm not even talking about.
I'm not talking about just if you don't

2671
02:10:37,731 --> 02:10:41,280
understand newton's physics,
not newt.

2672
02:10:41,570 --> 02:10:45,110
If I wished,
if I wished to make an argument about

2673
02:10:45,111 --> 02:10:47,570
gravity,
I wouldn't go saying that.

2674
02:10:47,571 --> 02:10:50,870
That isn't the part of hey suits,
gomorrah's theory that I'm interested

2675
02:10:50,871 --> 02:10:52,970
in.
I'm interested in the other aspect of

2676
02:10:52,971 --> 02:10:55,360
his work.
His observations through

2677
02:10:55,870 --> 02:10:58,380
feels that way.
My point was simply to point out that

2678
02:10:58,381 --> 02:11:00,140
you didn't understand the mechanics.

2679
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:03,570
Stop wasting time here

2680
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:06,920
for grant.
We the way the article is on a second.

2681
02:11:06,990 --> 02:11:08,320
Hold on,
let these guys talk about.

2682
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:09,980
We did misrepresent him.
We did.

2683
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:14,630
The way the sentence is structured,
it's clearly out of context.

2684
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:15,890
We're changing.
We're going to change.

2685
02:11:15,891 --> 02:11:18,500
That waS taken out of context and that's
what I'm objecting.

2686
02:11:18,790 --> 02:11:21,110
I'm not sure why he included in the book
in the first place,

2687
02:11:21,111 --> 02:11:24,020
but he's not arguing about the gravity
at all.

2688
02:11:24,350 --> 02:11:27,260
so we will fix that.
Maybe we can get straight to the

2689
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:28,260
flooding thing that,
uh,

2690
02:11:28,261 --> 02:11:31,460
that song talking about graham is fine
with that.

2691
02:11:31,461 --> 02:11:31,971
I mean,
graham,

2692
02:11:31,971 --> 02:11:32,804
I know there was something.

2693
02:11:33,620 --> 02:11:38,600
The other thing that I find to be
misrepresenting his statement yet

2694
02:11:38,810 --> 02:11:42,290
hancock makes the following stunning
claim quote,

2695
02:11:42,650 --> 02:11:45,920
our ancestors are being initiated into
the secrets of metals.

2696
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:49,820
And how to make swords and knives.
What marked the fat does not tell his

2697
02:11:49,821 --> 02:11:53,150
readers is that I make that claim.
I don't make that claim.

2698
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:56,480
I am actually reporting what is said in
the book of enoch.

2699
02:11:56,780 --> 02:11:59,630
That's not me who say we will the book
of enoch grand.

2700
02:11:59,631 --> 02:12:00,640
We'll fix it.
Okay.

2701
02:12:01,700 --> 02:12:02,870
Otherwise,
let's get.

2702
02:12:02,871 --> 02:12:05,210
Let's get back to the main narrative.
This for god's sake.

2703
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:08,090
okay.
Just give me the list of them

2704
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:12,290
things that will fix it becaUse that's
not the point of that.

2705
02:12:13,130 --> 02:12:14,270
Well,
mark,

2706
02:12:14,271 --> 02:12:19,130
you're obviously very critical of
graham's work and maybe erroneouSly.

2707
02:12:19,131 --> 02:12:20,510
So.
But let's,

2708
02:12:20,720 --> 02:12:24,560
let's get to what you think about what
you've heard so far.

2709
02:12:25,940 --> 02:12:26,970
Alright,
mr rogan.

2710
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:32,560
I don't want to come across as pompous
scientists.

2711
02:12:33,050 --> 02:12:38,050
What I want to do is I want to protect
people from these grandiose a

2712
02:12:40,281 --> 02:12:44,510
assumptions graham and his first Mr.
Hancock and his first book.

2713
02:12:44,600 --> 02:12:46,640
Please call me grandma.
Please call me.

2714
02:12:46,641 --> 02:12:48,130
Grab.
Okay.

2715
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:52,760
Graham and his first book in
fingerprints a suggested that that there

2716
02:12:52,761 --> 02:12:57,380
was a,
a continent where the civilization lived

2717
02:12:57,381 --> 02:13:01,880
and through some machinations,
this continent of went south and,

2718
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:04,430
and ended up destroying that
civilization.

2719
02:13:04,431 --> 02:13:09,431
Will as a geologist that that's just,
that's just nonsense and now he comes

2720
02:13:09,861 --> 02:13:13,820
back and he wants us to believe that he
was all wrong and then all of a sudden

2721
02:13:13,821 --> 02:13:17,230
it's okay now to believe in common
strikes to kill this.

2722
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:20,850
This famous civilization not supposed to
exist was duping.

2723
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:25,370
People not know if he means to do it.
He seems to be doofy mock.

2724
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:26,240
Oh my I work

2725
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:28,440
is in print and online.
I mean I see the.

2726
02:13:28,441 --> 02:13:31,530
I gather that you see your role as a
protector for the public.

2727
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:35,250
Obviously you feel that the public are
not intelligent enough to make

2728
02:13:35,251 --> 02:13:38,220
discerning decisions of their own in
this respect.

2729
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:40,770
However,
to address that the public doesn't

2730
02:13:40,771 --> 02:13:42,920
understand the science.
Okay,

2731
02:13:42,921 --> 02:13:45,600
so to the degree that you're
misrepresented,

2732
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:49,690
so they need the superior knowledge of
mock defense in order to understandable

2733
02:13:49,710 --> 02:13:51,570
finding.
They need the knowledge of sine.

2734
02:13:51,571 --> 02:13:52,370
Okay.
Well that's okay.

2735
02:13:52,370 --> 02:13:54,810
Knowledge that I have.
Let me come to your point,

2736
02:13:55,050 --> 02:13:58,080
which is you're saying that I proposed
one mechanism for cataclysm and

2737
02:13:58,081 --> 02:14:01,260
fingerprints of the gods and that I'm
proposing another mechanism for

2738
02:14:01,261 --> 02:14:04,320
cataclysm today.
What I proposed in fingerprints of the

2739
02:14:04,321 --> 02:14:09,321
gods was that there had been a gigantic
cataclysm in the ballpark of 12,500

2740
02:14:10,831 --> 02:14:13,740
years ago.
I looked at a number of possibilities of

2741
02:14:13,741 --> 02:14:16,830
which the most striking to me at the
time was earth crust,

2742
02:14:16,831 --> 02:14:18,240
displacement and earth crust.

2743
02:14:18,240 --> 02:14:20,880
Displacement is reported,
is the work of charles hapgood,

2744
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:23,730
not my work,
but I do report it in fingerprints of

2745
02:14:23,731 --> 02:14:27,990
the gods as an excellent theory,
which explains the information.

2746
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:31,440
Since I wrote fingerprints of the gods.
I've learned a lot.

2747
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:35,280
I've learned a lot and I wouldn't want
to defend that theory strongly today.

2748
02:14:35,281 --> 02:14:38,580
I don't know if you have bought the
latest edition of my book,

2749
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:41,010
the paperback edition of magicians of
the gods,

2750
02:14:41,280 --> 02:14:44,760
but it contains a chapter saying
whatever happened to earth crust

2751
02:14:44,761 --> 02:14:47,640
displacement.
I addressed the change of view in this

2752
02:14:47,641 --> 02:14:50,660
and I think I have a right to change my
view and I think it's.

2753
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:54,090
It's healthy that,
I mean why would I stick permanently to

2754
02:14:54,091 --> 02:14:57,630
a view that I hold in 1995?
If new evidence persuades me that it's

2755
02:14:57,631 --> 02:14:59,040
wrong.
I'm sure that's a good thing.

2756
02:14:59,041 --> 02:15:03,000
Not a bad thing,
and I'm fundamental proposition is we

2757
02:15:03,001 --> 02:15:06,600
had a massive global cataclysm in the
ballpark of 12,000,

2758
02:15:06,601 --> 02:15:09,060
500 years ago,
so naturally it's of great interest to

2759
02:15:09,061 --> 02:15:13,830
me when a large group of scientists,
more than 60 of them over a period of

2760
02:15:13,831 --> 02:15:18,180
more than 10 years now present evidence
of a massive cognitive impact event

2761
02:15:18,210 --> 02:15:19,680
12,000,
800 years ago.

2762
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:24,680
Exactly the way you are applying that.
There are a lot of people are to believe

2763
02:15:24,870 --> 02:15:26,040
in this.
There are,

2764
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:28,440
there are some people that believe in
it.

2765
02:15:28,441 --> 02:15:30,240
I agree,
but for the most part,

2766
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:31,230
I think,
uh,

2767
02:15:31,230 --> 02:15:34,710
taking an honest view,
the common hypothesis has gotten to vote

2768
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:36,060
well,
that's complete rubbish.

2769
02:15:36,660 --> 02:15:40,200
Complete rubbish would also point out
that in fingerprints you had people

2770
02:15:40,201 --> 02:15:43,170
believing that the end of the world was
coming in 2012.

2771
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:46,830
How am I supposed to take you seriously
when you say things like that and then

2772
02:15:46,831 --> 02:15:48,810
change your mind and we can all be done
by now.

2773
02:15:49,620 --> 02:15:53,100
I have absolutely changed my mind on the
mayan calendar.

2774
02:15:53,570 --> 02:15:55,860
Uh,
I regard the mayan calendar as an

2775
02:15:55,861 --> 02:16:00,360
interesting technological artifact with
a better estimate of the length of the

2776
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:02,950
solar year.
Then the estimate that we have with us

2777
02:16:03,030 --> 02:16:07,170
today,
the mayan calendar is based primarily on

2778
02:16:07,171 --> 02:16:10,980
the position of the sun amongst the
constellations at the winter solstice,

2779
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:16,220
and we are in an eight year window when
the sun sits astride the dark rift of

2780
02:16:16,741 --> 02:16:21,741
the milky way between the constellations
of sagittarius and scorpio on the winter

2781
02:16:21,811 --> 02:16:24,240
solstice.
That window is 80 years wide.

2782
02:16:24,241 --> 02:16:26,100
So the story of the mind calendar by the
way,

2783
02:16:26,130 --> 02:16:28,690
isn't actually quite over yet,
but I'm not.

2784
02:16:28,810 --> 02:16:29,643
I'm means

2785
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:32,470
yes,
I know exactly what precession means.

2786
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:33,071
Okay.
Well,

2787
02:16:33,071 --> 02:16:38,071
all of this stuff that you claim is on a
procession of procession is the,

2788
02:16:38,560 --> 02:16:41,110
is the,
the earth spinning like a top,

2789
02:16:41,111 --> 02:16:44,920
don't teach with running through comic
clouds.

2790
02:16:45,070 --> 02:16:49,600
and yet you're saying that somehow we're
on some sort of cycle where the comments

2791
02:16:49,601 --> 02:16:51,370
are going to come back and strike the
earth.

2792
02:16:51,660 --> 02:16:52,750
Uh,
right now,

2793
02:16:52,751 --> 02:16:55,810
sometime during the next 40 years.
That's what you said in magicians.

2794
02:16:55,830 --> 02:16:56,990
Now that's what,
that's what?

2795
02:16:57,610 --> 02:17:01,810
That's what [inaudible] club and bill
napier and emilio sporadic carto say I'm

2796
02:17:01,850 --> 02:17:04,720
new.
You're the one who said it in your book.

2797
02:17:04,721 --> 02:17:09,580
You just got all over.
Mr. Michael shermer for,

2798
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:11,890
for saying the same things about other
people.

2799
02:17:11,891 --> 02:17:14,650
I want to know what you think,
but mark told me what you think.

2800
02:17:14,710 --> 02:17:18,190
I am a reporter and I make it very clear
that

2801
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:22,630
you're talking to them about signs mark.

2802
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:24,440
We got to.
We can't talk over each other.

2803
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:29,880
I'm a reporter and it is my job to
report the work of other people and I

2804
02:17:30,551 --> 02:17:33,790
report the work of viktor club,
bill napier and emilio,

2805
02:17:33,800 --> 02:17:36,610
aesthetic carto,
all of whom draw attention to the taurid

2806
02:17:36,611 --> 02:17:40,480
meteor stream and who regarded as the
greatest collision hazard facing the

2807
02:17:40,481 --> 02:17:45,220
earth at this time and who specifically
indicate that we may run into a filament

2808
02:17:45,221 --> 02:17:47,410
of the taurid meteor stream in the next
30 years.

2809
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:49,870
That is going to be very bad for our
civilization.

2810
02:17:49,871 --> 02:17:52,350
It's not my thing to do with precision.
When,

2811
02:17:52,390 --> 02:17:54,600
when did I say it had anything to do
with procession?

2812
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:59,530
You have a whole session in magicians.
Indeed as a clock,

2813
02:17:59,531 --> 02:18:02,200
as a timer,
as a way of going back through the ages,

2814
02:18:02,201 --> 02:18:05,800
but I'm not saying precession is causing
this encounter with the taurid meteor

2815
02:18:05,801 --> 02:18:07,990
stream and go find the paragraph where I
say,

2816
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:08,621
no,
no,

2817
02:18:08,621 --> 02:18:09,160
no.

2818
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:11,380
What you're saying is that we're on a
cycle.

2819
02:18:11,640 --> 02:18:16,640
The 12,000 years ago this civilization
was destroyed and now you're saying,

2820
02:18:16,661 --> 02:18:19,330
oh,
that civilization was so smart that they

2821
02:18:19,331 --> 02:18:23,260
knew we were going to go through another
shower and we're all doomed in the next

2822
02:18:23,261 --> 02:18:26,170
40 years.
You didn't say doomed and in magicians

2823
02:18:26,171 --> 02:18:29,890
like you did in fingerprints,
but we must conclude that that's your

2824
02:18:29,891 --> 02:18:33,640
opinion because I don't know anybody
else that you referenced on that issue.

2825
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:35,800
Well,
it has nothing to do with that.

2826
02:18:35,810 --> 02:18:40,690
It's not even on that cycle.
I never saw a cycle of about 21,000

2827
02:18:40,691 --> 02:18:44,140
years.
Twenty five cycles per session.

2828
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:47,980
Twenty 5,920 years.
Actually,

2829
02:18:47,981 --> 02:18:52,120
it's not awful.
Precession one degree every 72 years.

2830
02:18:52,121 --> 02:18:54,650
Give or take a small margin.
That is the precession,

2831
02:18:54,880 --> 02:18:59,380
the teaching grandma to suck eggs here.
So anyway,

2832
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:02,920
I guess this has just been going on all
day.

2833
02:19:02,921 --> 02:19:07,300
You can't criticize michael for bringing
up other people and we're saying strange

2834
02:19:07,301 --> 02:19:09,190
things and compare and say,
oh no,

2835
02:19:09,191 --> 02:19:11,440
you can't say that because it's not
about me.

2836
02:19:11,441 --> 02:19:12,470
It's not true.
You're.

2837
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:15,610
You're doing the same thing.
You're reporting about other people and

2838
02:19:15,611 --> 02:19:16,444
saying,
nonsense.

2839
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:21,150
I'm reporting the work of viktor clue.
Bill napier and emilia,

2840
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:25,120
sped carto.
I also indicate that I strongly support

2841
02:19:25,360 --> 02:19:26,980
that work.
That's as far as I go.

2842
02:19:27,020 --> 02:19:27,980
Mark is if I could

2843
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,580
stop you here.
So you think that this comment wiping

2844
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:35,300
out all the ice age megafauna theory has
been debunked?

2845
02:19:35,301 --> 02:19:36,134
Is that what you're saying?

2846
02:19:36,850 --> 02:19:38,560
No sir.
I have not seen that.

2847
02:19:38,561 --> 02:19:40,930
Well,
I think that if you read the literature

2848
02:19:40,931 --> 02:19:43,870
carefully,
the majority of scientists right now,

2849
02:19:43,871 --> 02:19:47,390
and I know that this is still going,
you know what I like about the common

2850
02:19:47,391 --> 02:19:50,200
people,
is that they're doing it in the

2851
02:19:50,201 --> 02:19:53,830
scientifically right way.
They're getting people to review the

2852
02:19:53,831 --> 02:19:56,290
material.
They're getting people to go through

2853
02:19:56,291 --> 02:20:00,070
that gauntlet to where they get
criticized and they make sure that they

2854
02:20:00,071 --> 02:20:04,720
do things right and to get it out there.
Firestone did this in 2007.

2855
02:20:04,721 --> 02:20:06,550
He was crucified.
He's come back,

2856
02:20:06,720 --> 02:20:08,680
his,
his group has come back with a lot of

2857
02:20:08,681 --> 02:20:11,980
good stuff,
so I want to wait and see this play out.

2858
02:20:11,981 --> 02:20:15,430
I said I didn't like paper that we're
going to have to wait to get a

2859
02:20:15,431 --> 02:20:17,890
conclusion here.
So I'm not saying that they're wrong,

2860
02:20:17,891 --> 02:20:20,560
but right now if I read the literature
as a scientist,

2861
02:20:20,561 --> 02:20:23,010
I have to say that the comment guys are,
are,

2862
02:20:23,011 --> 02:20:23,980
are getting hit pretty hard.

2863
02:20:24,040 --> 02:20:26,350
What do you take?
What do you make of the latest platinum

2864
02:20:26,351 --> 02:20:28,210
paper in nature?
Scientific reports,

2865
02:20:28,211 --> 02:20:32,620
the platinum anomaly across north
America and it's coincidence in time

2866
02:20:32,621 --> 02:20:34,900
with the greenland ice cores and the
platinum anomaly there.

2867
02:20:34,901 --> 02:20:35,734
What do you say to that?

2868
02:20:36,200 --> 02:20:38,780
Well,
I say that and maybe we can bring him

2869
02:20:38,781 --> 02:20:41,260
on.
The problem with that is,

2870
02:20:41,320 --> 02:20:43,580
is that what does platinum have to do
with the common,

2871
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:45,950
you know,
platinums are high and asteroids,

2872
02:20:45,951 --> 02:20:48,770
but they're not high in comments.
Comments are icy bodies.

2873
02:20:48,771 --> 02:20:50,150
I saw the paper,
I read it.

2874
02:20:50,470 --> 02:20:52,100
Um,
I think it's interesting,

2875
02:20:52,101 --> 02:20:57,050
but I can't for the life of me figure
out how he's correlating it and he has

2876
02:20:57,270 --> 02:21:00,020
in,
in the different areas of the clovis,

2877
02:21:00,021 --> 02:21:02,710
he has platinum concentrations that are,
that,

2878
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:07,900
that are seemingly not matching up there
outside the younger dryas,

2879
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:10,880
other inside the younger dryas.
I'd like to,

2880
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:15,830
I'd like you to show them
to understand what he's trying to say.

2881
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:18,740
It doesn't refute the common hypothesis.

2882
02:21:18,830 --> 02:21:22,790
Let's bring malcolm on since he's one of
the coauthors of the platinum paper.

2883
02:21:23,780 --> 02:21:27,440
This is going to get super complicated,
but let's try it one color at a time.

2884
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:29,210
We could only do one color at a time
apparently,

2885
02:21:29,270 --> 02:21:31,040
but I think my malcolm,
you know,

2886
02:21:31,050 --> 02:21:31,670
should,
should,

2887
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:32,503
should have it.

2888
02:21:32,580 --> 02:21:34,820
I don't want to criticize him if he
can't be here.

2889
02:21:34,960 --> 02:21:38,060
That's okay.
You can talk a little bit if I may,

2890
02:21:38,330 --> 02:21:41,330
about a go go beckley,
tempe,

2891
02:21:41,331 --> 02:21:46,331
because I've read a schmidt.
I know that schmidt never ever found

2892
02:21:48,261 --> 02:21:51,580
anything to suggest that there were
anything in the early part of beckley,

2893
02:21:51,590 --> 02:21:54,260
tippy that,
that we're not hunter gatherers.

2894
02:21:54,261 --> 02:21:55,890
They all were hunter gatherers.
You know,

2895
02:21:56,010 --> 02:21:57,520
he found 20.
I think I,

2896
02:21:57,530 --> 02:22:01,460
I may be wrong on this,
but I think he found 22,000 stone tools

2897
02:22:01,461 --> 02:22:02,280
there.
Uh,

2898
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:06,170
when he dug that place up,
any domesticated animals,

2899
02:22:06,171 --> 02:22:08,990
he never found any domesticated grain.
The,

2900
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:14,080
he found tons of bones of animals.
So we know that about 100 to 200 people

2901
02:22:14,331 --> 02:22:18,590
were probably working on go back to the
top at one time and they were fed by

2902
02:22:18,591 --> 02:22:23,570
wild animals and grain.
So there's no reason to go out on a limb

2903
02:22:23,571 --> 02:22:26,520
here and say that some magical
civilization

2904
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:27,540
came in.
And by the way,

2905
02:22:27,541 --> 02:22:29,160
that's another thing that drives me
crazy.

2906
02:22:29,460 --> 02:22:31,620
You're saying that these guys were
magicians.

2907
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:33,660
You're saying that they had secret
knowledge.

2908
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:37,530
What possible secret knowledge that they
give to the people that go back to tibi.

2909
02:22:37,770 --> 02:22:42,390
How can you possibly not saying that the
word magicians of the gods comes from

2910
02:22:42,391 --> 02:22:47,391
the app kalu in ancient sumeria and they
were considered to have superior powers

2911
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:49,950
that they were considered to be
magicians have a salt.

2912
02:22:50,160 --> 02:22:51,540
Am I?
Should I not report that?

2913
02:22:51,541 --> 02:22:54,930
Because it's there in the sumerian text,
you should tell us what michael's been

2914
02:22:54,931 --> 02:22:57,420
asking all day is what were their super
powers.

2915
02:22:57,480 --> 02:23:00,660
I'm not saying that they had super
powers this the sumerians who said that

2916
02:23:00,661 --> 02:23:03,360
I simply report that you can regard that
as a cop out if you like,

2917
02:23:03,361 --> 02:23:06,840
but I am a fucking reporter book
magicians of the gods because that's the

2918
02:23:06,841 --> 02:23:08,970
direct implication of the blue.

2919
02:23:09,450 --> 02:23:12,450
They were the magicians of the calls.
Like you're saying they had magical

2920
02:23:12,451 --> 02:23:13,950
powers to me.
No,

2921
02:23:13,951 --> 02:23:16,870
I'm saying that they were the magicians
of the gods as they were called in an

2922
02:23:16,871 --> 02:23:18,330
ancient culture.
That's all.

2923
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:22,290
I just want your audience to know.
That schmidt who worked there for 20

2924
02:23:22,291 --> 02:23:26,790
years that had didn't go there for two
days and look around and take some notes

2925
02:23:26,791 --> 02:23:30,510
and leaving on a book on it.
He worked there for 20 years and he

2926
02:23:30,511 --> 02:23:34,530
found date with dates and everything.
He found that there were hunter

2927
02:23:34,531 --> 02:23:36,830
gatherers.
They're building those mega list just

2928
02:23:36,940 --> 02:23:39,200
like you went to.
If you went to easter island,

2929
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:42,930
can be found the ali and,
and you said,

2930
02:23:42,931 --> 02:23:45,360
oh my gosh,
there must have been some secret

2931
02:23:45,361 --> 02:23:49,260
civilization that made these milan
because stupid hunter gatherers couldn't

2932
02:23:49,261 --> 02:23:52,200
possibly make these will.
We know that there were no special

2933
02:23:52,201 --> 02:23:53,580
people on easter island.

2934
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:57,620
It had to be made by a hunter gathers.
Why would you poopoo uh,

2935
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:00,220
sorry.
Are you saying I have to call it.

2936
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:03,750
Are you serious?
Are you seriously saying that the

2937
02:24:03,751 --> 02:24:05,840
inhabitants of easter island were hunter
gatherers?

2938
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:07,590
Oh,
absolutely.

2939
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:11,490
And if fatter effect,
we saw that little island in the pacific

2940
02:24:11,491 --> 02:24:16,491
ocean,
the pacific ocean until about 1000 years

2941
02:24:16,501 --> 02:24:19,380
ago on hold on to until about 1000 years
ago.

2942
02:24:19,381 --> 02:24:24,060
What do you think they hold a big
civilization mark?

2943
02:24:24,061 --> 02:24:25,320
Please let them respond.
Go ahead.

2944
02:24:26,340 --> 02:24:27,120
Well,
first of all,

2945
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,680
have you met claire?
Did you meet klaus schmidt?

2946
02:24:29,100 --> 02:24:32,520
Do you know him personally?
You know that I haven't met him.

2947
02:24:32,521 --> 02:24:32,970
Okay,
well,

2948
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:34,920
I did meet him.
I do know him personally.

2949
02:24:34,940 --> 02:24:38,850
I did record.
I did record my interviews with him with

2950
02:24:38,851 --> 02:24:42,660
his agreement and and what he states
clearly I don't disagree with you that

2951
02:24:42,661 --> 02:24:46,020
the people around go back to tempe,
were hunter gatherers when go back to

2952
02:24:46,030 --> 02:24:47,040
tempe was started.

2953
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:50,790
What precisely intrigued klaus smith was
the possibility,

2954
02:24:50,791 --> 02:24:51,960
his praise,
not mine,

2955
02:24:52,170 --> 02:24:54,720
that got back.
Lee tappy was a center of innovation,

2956
02:24:54,990 --> 02:24:58,560
a place where new ideas were
deliberately seeded in spread out in the

2957
02:24:58,561 --> 02:25:01,320
population.
I have klaus schmidt on record saying

2958
02:25:01,321 --> 02:25:05,970
that I quote him saying that in my book
and that to me is a very interesting

2959
02:25:05,971 --> 02:25:10,320
proposition because it suggests that we
have a site here that is being used to

2960
02:25:10,321 --> 02:25:12,990
mobilize the population and to transfer
to theM,

2961
02:25:12,991 --> 02:25:17,991
but knowledge of agriculture which
suddenly appears around go back at the

2962
02:25:18,331 --> 02:25:20,730
time that go back to the tappc is
functioning.

2963
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,790
What do you mean by that?
What I mean by what I mean by suddenly

2964
02:25:24,791 --> 02:25:29,550
it's klaus schmidt bet stated very
clearly that these are the people that

2965
02:25:29,551 --> 02:25:33,130
very same people who made go back to
tempe and claw schmidt's view are the

2966
02:25:33,131 --> 02:25:35,950
people who quote unquote invented
agriculture.

2967
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:38,140
If you don't mind me interrupting here
for a second,

2968
02:25:38,170 --> 02:25:42,180
what about easter island?
Was easter island established by a

2969
02:25:42,181 --> 02:25:45,160
hunter gatherers or not?
You were saying no.

2970
02:25:45,570 --> 02:25:47,290
You say it was established by a hunter
gatherer.

2971
02:25:47,291 --> 02:25:47,981
As I say,
not.

2972
02:25:47,981 --> 02:25:49,930
I say easter harlem was an agricultural
society.

2973
02:25:49,931 --> 02:25:50,660
What's that?
What's that?

2974
02:25:50,660 --> 02:25:53,210
Hunt and gather on a tiny island.
Have you been to easter island?

2975
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:57,100
I have six times and you know,
you can walk across it in three hours.

2976
02:25:57,310 --> 02:25:58,930
What's that?
A hunt and gather on that.

2977
02:26:00,630 --> 02:26:02,800
Oh no,
you're misunderstanding my point.

2978
02:26:03,580 --> 02:26:05,560
These are not sophisticated people.
Okay.

2979
02:26:05,561 --> 02:26:08,600
But sorry,
you sat and go quickly tapping.

2980
02:26:09,490 --> 02:26:13,840
I think that you got it right.
In fact it's a unesco site.

2981
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:16,890
We all recognize how important it is,
but what,

2982
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,060
what,
what I think michael and I can

2983
02:26:19,061 --> 02:26:23,350
understand is how this ties into some,
some magnificent civilization.

2984
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:27,610
There's nothing there that indicates
that they were influenced by some other

2985
02:26:27,611 --> 02:26:31,840
civilization except that they started
out as hunter gatherers and then they

2986
02:26:31,841 --> 02:26:34,220
evolved into a,
um,

2987
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:37,620
an agricultural society.
And that's what makes it a great site.

2988
02:26:37,690 --> 02:26:39,990
Can I answer you?
You are seriously saying that there's

2989
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:41,230
nothing there.
I mean,

2990
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:45,640
the largest megalithic site on earth,
7,000 years older than stonehenge is

2991
02:26:45,860 --> 02:26:47,380
there.
There's no background to it.

2992
02:26:47,910 --> 02:26:51,940
No evidence of practice or the
megalithic site itself is the problem

2993
02:26:51,941 --> 02:26:52,774
for me.

2994
02:26:53,390 --> 02:26:55,100
Okay.
I honestly,

2995
02:26:55,101 --> 02:26:58,220
we've got mega list in quite a few sites
and by the way,

2996
02:26:58,221 --> 02:27:00,620
you're right,
there's a mega list just down the road

2997
02:27:00,621 --> 02:27:01,760
from go beckley,
tippy,

2998
02:27:01,880 --> 02:27:03,800
and they're probably so that several
other.

2999
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:07,820
I can see them on maps and we need to
get to the wonderful amount of work to

3000
02:27:07,821 --> 02:27:08,690
do there.
You bet.

3001
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:11,030
So I think grammar is good.
Agreement

3002
02:27:12,810 --> 02:27:14,890
is,
is that I don't think that there's any,

3003
02:27:15,260 --> 02:27:18,960
any need to call upon this great
civilization that you,

3004
02:27:18,961 --> 02:27:20,340
you say exist.
well,

3005
02:27:20,410 --> 02:27:23,800
to me the simplest explanation is a
transfer of knowledge transfer of

3006
02:27:23,801 --> 02:27:26,710
technology.
I've been writing about the possibility

3007
02:27:26,711 --> 02:27:29,350
of a lost civilization for more than
quarter of a century.

3008
02:27:29,351 --> 02:27:31,900
That's what I do.
I hope that it's a useful contribution

3009
02:27:31,901 --> 02:27:33,190
to the debate.
I mean,

3010
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:37,480
archeologists can choose not to listen
to anything I say to dismiss me as a

3011
02:27:37,481 --> 02:27:41,710
complete lunatic as they often do.
To accuse me as you do in writing of

3012
02:27:41,711 --> 02:27:43,330
duping,
the public of conning,

3013
02:27:43,331 --> 02:27:48,070
the public and so on and so forth.
When you did use the word conning,

3014
02:27:48,190 --> 02:27:51,670
actually it's in the very last paragraph
of your article because I got it right

3015
02:27:51,671 --> 02:27:53,350
here in front of me.
We will fix it.

3016
02:27:56,070 --> 02:27:59,500
This was the first thing I wrote.
I just put it up for my students.

3017
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:00,413
Well,
it's there.

3018
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:02,980
Well wait,
hold on.

3019
02:28:04,160 --> 02:28:07,620
I am.
I am left with what I'm left with.

3020
02:28:07,650 --> 02:28:11,580
Is that hancock?
Am I going to put my reading glasses on

3021
02:28:11,581 --> 02:28:14,370
so I can read this properly?
What I am left with is quoting you,

3022
02:28:14,371 --> 02:28:17,700
mark,
is that hancock has a real knack for

3023
02:28:17,970 --> 02:28:21,560
wanting a hellacious number of people
into buying his books mean that's a

3024
02:28:21,561 --> 02:28:22,070
direct

3025
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:24,290
ad hominem insults.
it's online.

3026
02:28:24,291 --> 02:28:27,050
In your article,
do you stand by it or not,

3027
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:30,770
but listen,
I apologize to you for the use of that

3028
02:28:30,771 --> 02:28:31,930
language.
Just don't want you to.

3029
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:32,810
Because I do,
but

3030
02:28:34,670 --> 02:28:37,760
you used it in the first place.
I think you're misleading your students.

3031
02:28:37,970 --> 02:28:40,520
Why would you say that?
You're just putting that online for your

3032
02:28:40,521 --> 02:28:43,940
students as if that's not a big deal.
You're putting it on the internet.

3033
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:48,030
It'S a salient just putting it online
for your students and you've been proven

3034
02:28:48,210 --> 02:28:50,310
incorrect.
And how many different times in this

3035
02:28:50,311 --> 02:28:51,520
article now?
Well,

3036
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:53,040
about seven,
correct.

3037
02:28:53,130 --> 02:28:55,090
I haven't been proven incorrect.
Well,

3038
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:56,970
you have,
you misquote,

3039
02:28:57,770 --> 02:28:59,370
you don't give the context.
The neva guy.

3040
02:28:59,620 --> 02:29:03,810
Even michael and even michael has said
that the skeptic article will not,

3041
02:29:04,050 --> 02:29:06,960
will not reflect these outer context
statements that you're making here.

3042
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:08,700
Right?
So the core is,

3043
02:29:08,970 --> 02:29:11,910
is the impact hypothesis likely to be
true or not?

3044
02:29:11,970 --> 02:29:16,920
And as an independent phenomenon,
is it connected to go directly to epi in

3045
02:29:16,921 --> 02:29:18,330
the younger dryas?
I mean,

3046
02:29:18,331 --> 02:29:21,320
that's kind of what we're getting at.
So then we can,

3047
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:26,750
maybe you can explain that graph that
shows all of the glacial dam bursts and

3048
02:29:27,541 --> 02:29:32,541
the dating of those as,
as thousands of years before the 12,800

3049
02:29:32,581 --> 02:29:33,414
year impact.

3050
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,120
Yeah.
We need To know that you guys get into

3051
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:39,280
what does that,
what does that mean?

3052
02:29:39,281 --> 02:29:43,700
Well,
which map is at which map on your,

3053
02:29:43,701 --> 02:29:46,450
um,
which map mark?

3054
02:29:47,190 --> 02:29:48,060
Uh,
I'm sorry,

3055
02:29:48,061 --> 02:29:52,560
it's the glacial map of western
Washington or Washington state.

3056
02:29:53,150 --> 02:29:54,820
Yeah.
Jamie,

3057
02:29:54,850 --> 02:29:55,683
I'll put it up.

3058
02:29:57,510 --> 02:29:59,030
This is,
by the way up.

3059
02:29:59,360 --> 02:30:02,000
I should to protect michael here.
I,

3060
02:30:02,180 --> 02:30:04,820
I submitted this.
Michael made immense amount of changes

3061
02:30:04,821 --> 02:30:07,640
on that paper.
I put it up because I wanted my students

3062
02:30:07,641 --> 02:30:09,830
to see it.
I had no idea that people would go

3063
02:30:09,831 --> 02:30:14,831
online and look at that like you and
unfortunately you've sent tens of

3064
02:30:15,080 --> 02:30:17,360
thousands of people.
Probably two of my letting them know

3065
02:30:17,361 --> 02:30:22,310
it's on here and I'm sorry for that.
Is it okay to just put that up online

3066
02:30:22,311 --> 02:30:25,070
for your students?
How come you don't have any problem with

3067
02:30:25,071 --> 02:30:27,470
that?
But you do have a problem with it as it

3068
02:30:27,471 --> 02:30:29,810
stands being released to the general
public?

3069
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:33,590
Um,
well,

3070
02:30:33,630 --> 02:30:35,930
you know,
maybe it was like a nice stand by

3071
02:30:35,931 --> 02:30:39,740
everything I said except for the
personal comment at the end.

3072
02:30:41,250 --> 02:30:42,083
Well,
we'll see.

3073
02:30:44,220 --> 02:30:45,053
Yeah,
let's,

3074
02:30:45,810 --> 02:30:46,860
let's put up this mess.
Good at.

3075
02:30:46,920 --> 02:30:47,753
Back to the map.

3076
02:30:49,090 --> 02:30:52,660
Okay.
The brown areas are now I have to

3077
02:30:52,661 --> 02:30:56,080
emphasize that,
that the scab lands is very famous.

3078
02:30:56,081 --> 02:31:00,760
People have been working on geologists
have been working on this for more than

3079
02:31:00,760 --> 02:31:04,660
a hundred years I bet,
and very intricate detailed mapping and

3080
02:31:04,661 --> 02:31:07,570
we now know what areas have been flooded
that's in the brown.

3081
02:31:07,990 --> 02:31:10,630
The green areas are the old glacial
lakes.

3082
02:31:10,780 --> 02:31:13,390
Uh,
one of them you can see is the columbia

3083
02:31:13,391 --> 02:31:17,110
lake and the other one on the far right
over in Montana.

3084
02:31:17,370 --> 02:31:22,370
That's lake missoula.
Now I guess my point here is,

3085
02:31:24,060 --> 02:31:29,060
is that you guys want to make the
flooding out here to be immense and I

3086
02:31:30,961 --> 02:31:35,640
think brits original idea was that there
was this one flooding,

3087
02:31:36,030 --> 02:31:40,260
but then brex came to,
to understand after looking at the data

3088
02:31:40,650 --> 02:31:45,060
and all of the geology geologic work,
that it wasn't just one flood,

3089
02:31:45,061 --> 02:31:47,640
that it's many floods.
And that was the point of all of those

3090
02:31:47,641 --> 02:31:52,641
dates that I show you that there were,
there had been at least 17 specific

3091
02:31:52,921 --> 02:31:53,754
floods dated.

3092
02:31:53,820 --> 02:31:57,990
There are probably as many as 40 to 50
floods out there and they're all

3093
02:31:57,991 --> 02:32:02,550
probably related to a glacier dams
breaking.

3094
02:32:03,060 --> 02:32:07,830
Now.
Where in the world would you ever say

3095
02:32:07,831 --> 02:32:11,820
that this small area relative to an
entire content,

3096
02:32:12,390 --> 02:32:15,680
why would you say that this is evidence
for a common strike?

3097
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:18,480
Common strike,
not even the comment guys are saying

3098
02:32:18,750 --> 02:32:23,750
that this flooding out here is related
to a con because there are a large

3099
02:32:24,091 --> 02:32:26,570
number of area,
a very small number of,

3100
02:32:26,630 --> 02:32:28,860
of area,
actual area that is flooded.

3101
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:33,120
If you take a look now at my dates or
not my dates but the dates.

3102
02:32:33,420 --> 02:32:35,550
Um,
do you have that michael?

3103
02:32:35,820 --> 02:32:36,653
The one with.

3104
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:38,030
We're going to bring that up.
But uh,

3105
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:40,820
let's let randall carlson address you
because he's,

3106
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:44,130
I mean he's,
he's got a point that if you just look

3107
02:32:44,131 --> 02:32:47,190
at if you can find your,
your examination to this area,

3108
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:52,310
but the point is you've got evidence of
mega flooding all around the eye sheet

3109
02:32:52,861 --> 02:32:57,861
margin from the atlantic to the pacific.
You've got the work of key kikuyu and

3110
02:32:59,071 --> 02:33:02,280
lord in the midwestern states,
South Dakota,

3111
02:33:02,281 --> 02:33:05,130
North Dakota,
eastern Montana.

3112
02:33:05,190 --> 02:33:09,030
You've got massive spillways out there
that discharged off the ice sheet.

3113
02:33:09,450 --> 02:33:14,450
You have glacial river warren.
That was undoubtedly a formed by most

3114
02:33:15,091 --> 02:33:20,091
likely glacial lake agassi,
and you've got the st croix river where

3115
02:33:21,451 --> 02:33:24,900
I took graham a couple of years ago that
had mega floods down.

3116
02:33:24,901 --> 02:33:27,150
If there were mega floods down the
Mississippi river,

3117
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:31,740
there was glacial lake Wisconsin that
discharge down to Wisconsin river,

3118
02:33:31,741 --> 02:33:36,120
left the wiSconsin dells.
There are the finger lakes in New York

3119
02:33:36,121 --> 02:33:41,121
that probably were created by a massive
floods emanating off of that scholar

3120
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:45,480
scoured exactly right.
They were scoured and they were probably

3121
02:33:45,481 --> 02:33:50,481
scoured by subglacial floods that were
coming under a high pressure because you

3122
02:33:50,641 --> 02:33:52,950
know,
you have the drumlin fields that are

3123
02:33:52,951 --> 02:33:56,970
just to the south of them and I,
you've probably seen the work of john

3124
02:33:56,971 --> 02:34:01,380
sean,
a fair beanie and bruce rainy and knows

3125
02:34:01,660 --> 02:34:05,030
Canada drones is crazy.

3126
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:07,930
Well,
why?

3127
02:34:07,960 --> 02:34:09,340
Why would that be?
Why would,

3128
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:11,920
how do you propose the gremliNs then
were formed?

3129
02:34:12,430 --> 02:34:13,360
Oh,
easily.

3130
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:16,870
Uh,
these glaciers came forward and tops top

3131
02:34:17,210 --> 02:34:18,043
the,
the,

3132
02:34:18,130 --> 02:34:22,480
the terminal moraine and spread to the
moraines out to,

3133
02:34:22,481 --> 02:34:23,440
into drones.

3134
02:34:24,170 --> 02:34:25,810
But how,
I mean,

3135
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:28,330
you've got,
you've got features that look like

3136
02:34:28,331 --> 02:34:31,000
they're totally fluvial he produced.
You have,

3137
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:34,900
they look like inverted motels.
You look at the internal stratification.

3138
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:38,260
How does glaciers create internal
stratification?

3139
02:34:38,770 --> 02:34:41,700
I've looked at,
I've looked at at numerous drum,

3140
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:46,330
I'm in Canada,
I've looked at drum in New York state.

3141
02:34:46,331 --> 02:34:51,160
I've looked at gremlins and probably a
dozen different places and where you can

3142
02:34:51,161 --> 02:34:55,800
see exposures you see stratification.
You don't see if,

3143
02:34:55,860 --> 02:35:00,370
if glaciers are grinding over a
deformable sub straight,

3144
02:35:00,400 --> 02:35:05,380
how is it that they produce anything
other than a chaotic jumble of glacial

3145
02:35:05,381 --> 02:35:09,580
till you can actually see layer and I've
seen it myself and we can pull up

3146
02:35:09,581 --> 02:35:11,380
pictures of it here in a minute and I'd
like for you

3147
02:35:11,460 --> 02:35:15,430
explain to me you do that because I'm
not disagreeing with you a drama and by

3148
02:35:15,431 --> 02:35:19,690
definition is made up of till I think
we're getting kind of technical for this

3149
02:35:19,691 --> 02:35:22,300
audience,
but you know an esker is something

3150
02:35:22,301 --> 02:35:24,100
that's stratified,
not adrenaline.

3151
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,310
You're missing.
You're missing identifying them as

3152
02:35:27,311 --> 02:35:27,960
drumline.

3153
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:30,480
No,
I am not misidentifying gremlins.

3154
02:35:30,481 --> 02:35:33,570
I know very clearly the difference
between an asker and a drama and I've

3155
02:35:33,571 --> 02:35:36,240
looked at many askers.
I've hiked on him.

3156
02:35:36,320 --> 02:35:40,170
I put sloan over him in the finger lakes
or gouged.

3157
02:35:40,470 --> 02:35:41,610
They are gouged.
Yes.

3158
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:46,650
Are they gagged by glaciers or are they
also gouged by subglacial mega floods?

3159
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:50,460
That's the question in that.
I think that's a fair question to ask

3160
02:35:50,461 --> 02:35:53,280
and if we look at some of the studies,
we find out that the,

3161
02:35:53,310 --> 02:35:56,700
that the depositional material in them
is massive.

3162
02:35:56,701 --> 02:35:58,560
It's not stratified.
It's massive,

3163
02:35:58,561 --> 02:36:02,070
is if it Was dumped in there over a very
short period of time.

3164
02:36:03,360 --> 02:36:04,880
Let me go back to the,
uh,

3165
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,510
to,
to the bigger picture,

3166
02:36:06,630 --> 02:36:10,050
but hold on a second,
but what's your point about that?

3167
02:36:12,090 --> 02:36:12,621
The,
I'm sorry.

3168
02:36:12,621 --> 02:36:14,600
Respond to that.
What he just said.

3169
02:36:15,470 --> 02:36:16,940
What am I responding to?
Oh,

3170
02:36:17,690 --> 02:36:19,280
look,
we're going to have to disagree.

3171
02:36:19,281 --> 02:36:20,750
I mean,
what am I supposed to argue?

3172
02:36:20,840 --> 02:36:22,490
I don't want to get into an argument
with him here.

3173
02:36:22,500 --> 02:36:26,420
Keith thinks that they're done by water.
I entered the traditionally the way most

3174
02:36:26,421 --> 02:36:30,770
geologists seed the grit the finger
lakes is there out there are parallel to

3175
02:36:30,771 --> 02:36:33,050
one another if,
if he thinks it's water.

3176
02:36:33,051 --> 02:36:34,160
Okay,
what can we do?

3177
02:36:34,161 --> 02:36:35,300
We can disagree.
I guess.

3178
02:36:35,960 --> 02:36:40,960
Let me go back up to the,
to the main glacier of the glacier,

3179
02:36:41,530 --> 02:36:45,230
while he broke her,
suggested in nine in the nineties,

3180
02:36:45,550 --> 02:36:46,580
uh,
that water,

3181
02:36:46,640 --> 02:36:47,840
uh,
potentially,

3182
02:36:48,040 --> 02:36:49,880
uh,
was changed from flowing down the

3183
02:36:49,881 --> 02:36:53,540
Mississippi valley into the atlantic or
the arctic.

3184
02:36:54,140 --> 02:36:57,320
No one has been able to find any
evidence of flooding towards the

3185
02:36:57,321 --> 02:37:00,860
atlantic or regarding.
So when you say there are all kinds of

3186
02:37:00,861 --> 02:37:05,750
evidence of flooding up there,
wally broecker backed off of his,

3187
02:37:05,930 --> 02:37:08,480
of his theory because we couldn't find
any flooding.

3188
02:37:08,710 --> 02:37:13,330
Why he backed off of was the idea that
the draining of glacial lake agassi

3189
02:37:13,331 --> 02:37:15,850
triggered the younger dryas because
they,

3190
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:18,260
the,
the dating of the draining of glacial

3191
02:37:18,261 --> 02:37:23,261
lake agassi was post younger dryas,
and so that's what he backed off of him

3192
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:25,850
necessarily because look,
we know that there were,

3193
02:37:25,870 --> 02:37:28,720
that,
there were somewhere and then carefully

3194
02:37:29,460 --> 02:37:34,270
dayton carefully math.
You can watch the old tide glacier move

3195
02:37:34,271 --> 02:37:38,230
back lorraine after lorraine,
and there are no holes in that moraine

3196
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:39,880
that,
that suggests flooding.

3197
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,940
There's no change in the lake levels of
lake agassi.

3198
02:37:43,080 --> 02:37:45,370
There's no evidence there.
Oh,

3199
02:37:45,371 --> 02:37:46,960
randall,
for flooding.

3200
02:37:46,990 --> 02:37:49,450
you've got it wrong.
If you look at the mapping that the

3201
02:37:49,480 --> 02:37:51,580
careful mapping that the geologists have
done,

3202
02:37:51,870 --> 02:37:54,990
you've just said that there was no
change in the level of lake agassi.

3203
02:37:55,230 --> 02:37:56,790
How is that possible?
I mean,

3204
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:01,410
as the ice receded,
the glacial lake agathy expanded and at

3205
02:38:01,411 --> 02:38:06,411
some point that finally breached right
there at my big stone lake in Minnesota

3206
02:38:07,051 --> 02:38:10,830
and basically carved out the Minnesota
river valley,

3207
02:38:11,130 --> 02:38:16,000
which geological studies have confirmed.
They call it a river warren,

3208
02:38:16,010 --> 02:38:18,930
and he confirmed it.
Essentially it was carrying it's pake.

3209
02:38:18,931 --> 02:38:23,310
Peak discharge was roughly 4,000 times
greater than the modern Minnesota river

3210
02:38:23,311 --> 02:38:27,510
that flows there
to the Mississippi.

3211
02:38:27,660 --> 02:38:31,770
The Mississippi then conveyed that water
into the gulf of Mexico and deposited

3212
02:38:31,771 --> 02:38:35,340
huge amounts of delta material that new
orleans is built on.

3213
02:38:35,341 --> 02:38:36,174
Now

3214
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:39,330
you know you're trying to make a flood
or a flood isn't.

3215
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:43,590
There's a difference between a glacier
melting which causes a lot of water and

3216
02:38:43,591 --> 02:38:48,000
a comment striking which cases creates
copious amounts of water.

3217
02:38:48,150 --> 02:38:51,030
I think you guys referred to it.
The last time is a tsunami.

3218
02:38:51,031 --> 02:38:53,790
There is no evidence of a tsunami in
north America.

3219
02:38:53,791 --> 02:38:54,930
Have you been?
Finally,

3220
02:38:54,931 --> 02:38:57,450
here's another question.
Why do you guys,

3221
02:38:57,630 --> 02:39:01,800
why aren't you guys talking about north
America when you're atlanta?

3222
02:39:01,801 --> 02:39:05,520
This is supposed to be in Egypt or are
you guys have run around?

3223
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:09,780
You found some evidence of flooding in
north America and somehow this relates

3224
02:39:09,781 --> 02:39:14,781
to a destruction of atlantis in some
lost civilization.

3225
02:39:17,850 --> 02:39:20,940
That's what I'm talking about now.
I'm not talking about that.

3226
02:39:20,941 --> 02:39:22,940
We know there was a fan of scan dni
sheet.

3227
02:39:22,950 --> 02:39:25,740
We know there was a core dni sheet.
We know there was a laurentide ice

3228
02:39:25,741 --> 02:39:27,240
sheet.
We know they all melted.

3229
02:39:27,241 --> 02:39:31,620
We know that there was somewhere around
6 million cubic miles oF ice wrapped up

3230
02:39:31,650 --> 02:39:36,650
in those,
in those ice sheets at the end of the

3231
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:38,070
late glacial maximum.
They're all gone now.

3232
02:39:38,250 --> 02:39:41,820
they had to melt.
That was an enormous amount of water and

3233
02:39:41,850 --> 02:39:44,430
I don't know if you have been out to the
scab lands.

3234
02:39:44,431 --> 02:39:48,090
I've been going back to the scab lands
and the area of glacial lake missoula

3235
02:39:48,091 --> 02:39:52,350
since 1970.
I've been across That thing 60,000 miles

3236
02:39:52,351 --> 02:39:55,590
back and forth.
I have over 10,000 photographs of the

3237
02:39:55,591 --> 02:40:00,390
material in the field and I can tell you
those floods were enormous.

3238
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:00,980
They were

3239
02:40:00,980 --> 02:40:03,080
beyond your cherry picking.
Look at the map.

3240
02:40:03,380 --> 02:40:06,410
You shown some pictures.
You know we can measure those current

3241
02:40:06,411 --> 02:40:10,410
ripple marks that you'd show.
We can measure how much water went over.

3242
02:40:10,670 --> 02:40:12,740
All you have to do is measure the
current ripples.

3243
02:40:12,741 --> 02:40:13,980
You can go into cameras

3244
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:17,520
prairie and you've got a current ripple
field there that is about seven miles

3245
02:40:17,521 --> 02:40:18,300
long.

3246
02:40:18,300 --> 02:40:19,860
I know it very well.

3247
02:40:19,960 --> 02:40:22,390
Okay.
And the high watermark and narrows at

3248
02:40:22,391 --> 02:40:24,700
4,000,
200 feet above sea level.

3249
02:40:24,850 --> 02:40:29,080
The floor of cameras,
prairie is just 1400 feet lower than

3250
02:40:29,081 --> 02:40:32,050
that.
So we know that there were 1400 feet of

3251
02:40:32,051 --> 02:40:35,010
water that pass through canvas prairie
and down into the

3252
02:40:35,090 --> 02:40:36,850
flathead river.
No,

3253
02:40:36,860 --> 02:40:39,250
we don't.
Because regarding.

3254
02:40:39,470 --> 02:40:41,210
Are you disregarding the high water
mark?

3255
02:40:41,211 --> 02:40:45,350
The bottom of the bottom of the canyon
to the top of the canyon is not what it

3256
02:40:45,351 --> 02:40:47,870
was when the water first started flowing
in that area.

3257
02:40:48,620 --> 02:40:50,570
You caN't take the bottom of the canyon
and say,

3258
02:40:50,571 --> 02:40:52,790
oh,
there must have been 4,000 feet of water

3259
02:40:52,791 --> 02:40:53,170
here.

3260
02:40:53,170 --> 02:40:55,600
I'm not talking about a canyon.
I'm talking about cameras.

3261
02:40:55,601 --> 02:40:57,490
Prairie basin,
which is not a canyon.

3262
02:40:57,491 --> 02:41:01,840
It's a base of road at one time.
Well most of the material in near was

3263
02:41:01,841 --> 02:41:04,360
washed in,
so I mean we don't know how much it

3264
02:41:04,361 --> 02:41:07,900
would have eroded until somebody does
some core samples to get down to

3265
02:41:08,380 --> 02:41:12,640
something that can be dated to earlier
delayed glacial maximum.

3266
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:17,880
But the floor of camus prairie is,
is thick layers of very coarse gravel

3267
02:41:18,910 --> 02:41:23,680
boulders and this is what composes the,
the current ripples that you see there.

3268
02:41:24,220 --> 02:41:24,651
I mean,
I,

3269
02:41:24,651 --> 02:41:28,030
I don't see how you can look at those
current ripples that are sometimes 40

3270
02:41:28,031 --> 02:41:32,920
and 50 feet in amplitude with two and
300 feet cord length and say that that

3271
02:41:32,921 --> 02:41:34,480
wasn't a catastrophic flow.

3272
02:41:34,700 --> 02:41:37,460
Maybe it wasn't.
It was a catastrophic flood,

3273
02:41:37,461 --> 02:41:40,980
but it wasn't like a tsunami.
Then how would you characterize your,

3274
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,570
and we can,
you know,

3275
02:41:42,590 --> 02:41:44,780
we can do,
we can play this game.

3276
02:41:44,840 --> 02:41:49,820
Are you saying there are every
geologists on the planet practically

3277
02:41:49,821 --> 02:41:53,780
says that there were about 40 different
floods until you came along

3278
02:41:58,160 --> 02:42:01,880
familiar with the workday and victor
baker or ruSsell bunker or a number of

3279
02:42:01,881 --> 02:42:05,390
others that have challenged the 40
floods hypothesis and.

3280
02:42:05,420 --> 02:42:08,720
And are you going to tell me that those
current ripples in cameras prairie are

3281
02:42:08,721 --> 02:42:09,350
created?
They're,

3282
02:42:09,350 --> 02:42:11,810
they're the product of 40 separate
floods.

3283
02:42:13,240 --> 02:42:14,230
Oh,
absolutely.

3284
02:42:14,380 --> 02:42:16,120
In fact,
when you show me your pictures,

3285
02:42:16,121 --> 02:42:18,940
I could see the flow changes in that.
Oh,

3286
02:42:18,941 --> 02:42:23,800
don't give me the year and credulous
stuff doesn't mean you're right.

3287
02:42:24,310 --> 02:42:26,230
You do the credit us all the time.
Mark.

3288
02:42:26,680 --> 02:42:29,560
Well,
so let's say some pretty incredible

3289
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:30,610
flood

3290
02:42:30,610 --> 02:42:32,050
is created.
The cameras prairie.

3291
02:42:32,051 --> 02:42:33,280
I want,
that's what you're saying.

3292
02:42:33,550 --> 02:42:35,650
That's,
that's the product of 40 separate

3293
02:42:35,651 --> 02:42:36,484
floods.

3294
02:42:37,030 --> 02:42:38,470
Correct.
So many floods in,

3295
02:42:38,471 --> 02:42:42,280
been in there.
I know that there are going their county

3296
02:42:42,580 --> 02:42:45,370
and,
and I last read something to the effect

3297
02:42:45,371 --> 02:42:46,204
of 40 somewhere.

3298
02:42:46,400 --> 02:42:48,030
Yeah.
That's based on the work of richard

3299
02:42:48,031 --> 02:42:52,020
weight goes back to the,
to the early eighties and I think he's

3300
02:42:52,021 --> 02:42:52,600
got.

3301
02:42:52,600 --> 02:42:53,170
No,
no,

3302
02:42:53,170 --> 02:42:53,960
go,
go to,

3303
02:42:53,960 --> 02:42:58,440
go to his graph and we go to his graph.
Who graph?

3304
02:42:58,441 --> 02:43:01,800
Which graph is this mark?
It's the one right below the map.

3305
02:43:02,060 --> 02:43:02,893
Yeah,
this one.

3306
02:43:04,630 --> 02:43:07,180
It's the dating floods.
Here we go.

3307
02:43:07,230 --> 02:43:08,350
We're,
we're at that right now.

3308
02:43:08,660 --> 02:43:11,170
I think I,
hopefully,

3309
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:13,830
hopefully we're disagreeing in,
uh,

3310
02:43:14,710 --> 02:43:19,710
as comrades here.
I'm just trying to give you some data

3311
02:43:20,351 --> 02:43:21,700
here.
Look at those.

3312
02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:24,280
Uh,
those missoula floods,

3313
02:43:24,520 --> 02:43:26,800
a lake,
lake missoula.

3314
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:30,130
He's gone dated.
You're seeing the dates.

3315
02:43:30,160 --> 02:43:33,520
He's got standard deviations.
One and two standard deviations on,

3316
02:43:33,550 --> 02:43:34,630
on,
on,

3317
02:43:34,690 --> 02:43:36,380
on the median there.
Uh,

3318
02:43:36,440 --> 02:43:39,850
so we've got these,
these things pinned by multiple carbon

3319
02:43:39,851 --> 02:43:42,850
dates.
The little bell curves there.

3320
02:43:42,851 --> 02:43:47,851
Show how many carbon dates he's got and
you can see that these are documented

3321
02:43:48,041 --> 02:43:49,210
very,
very well.

3322
02:43:49,480 --> 02:43:52,030
So I don't understand why you're,
you're,

3323
02:43:52,060 --> 02:43:55,990
you're so opposed to multiple floods.
In fact,

3324
02:43:55,991 --> 02:43:58,360
I've heard in the last time you guys
were on this show,

3325
02:43:58,660 --> 02:44:01,240
I heard you say that you thought there
were multiple floods.

3326
02:44:01,241 --> 02:44:03,130
Now you're trying to argue against that
idea.

3327
02:44:03,810 --> 02:44:04,890
I,
I still,

3328
02:44:04,950 --> 02:44:07,140
I still think there were multiple
floods.

3329
02:44:07,141 --> 02:44:10,650
I think we have to look at two distinct
regimes of floods though,

3330
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,320
and,
and,

3331
02:44:11,320 --> 02:44:15,150
and as far as the radio carbon dating,
the thing we have to be really careful

3332
02:44:15,151 --> 02:44:20,151
of is that floods will entrain older
sediment and in that older sediment

3333
02:44:21,271 --> 02:44:25,570
there could be radiocarbon dated
material that doesn't really date that

3334
02:44:25,610 --> 02:44:29,490
that time of the flood,
but was excavated by the flood in,

3335
02:44:29,491 --> 02:44:31,980
trained into flood waters and then
redeposited.

3336
02:44:31,981 --> 02:44:35,690
So
that's a major problem with radiocarbon

3337
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:37,650
dating anytime you're looking at flood
sediments.

3338
02:44:37,651 --> 02:44:39,420
And I do believe there were multiple
floods.

3339
02:44:39,421 --> 02:44:40,520
That's,
you know,

3340
02:44:40,590 --> 02:44:43,650
I think it's a misinterpretation.
I think that I only think that there was

3341
02:44:43,651 --> 02:44:45,600
one flood,
but there,

3342
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:49,860
the problem is here and I do,
I think we're colleagues and my approach

3343
02:44:49,861 --> 02:44:51,080
to this as just like,
you know,

3344
02:44:51,081 --> 02:44:53,130
in the ama ama,
when two guys get out there and try to

3345
02:44:53,131 --> 02:44:55,770
beat the crap out of each other,
and then at the end of it they gave each

3346
02:44:55,771 --> 02:44:57,750
other a hug.
That's kind of where I'm coming from.

3347
02:44:58,110 --> 02:44:59,010
So,
you know,

3348
02:44:59,030 --> 02:44:59,570
there's nothing

3349
02:44:59,570 --> 02:45:01,220
personal,
each other a hug,

3350
02:45:01,221 --> 02:45:03,200
but I feel the same way.
and by the way,

3351
02:45:03,201 --> 02:45:05,940
you guyS are very bright and,
and

3352
02:45:06,520 --> 02:45:08,710
very knowledgeable.
Well,

3353
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:09,281
you know,
I,

3354
02:45:09,281 --> 02:45:10,114
I,
I,

3355
02:45:10,300 --> 02:45:13,300
I really value this because I'm looking
for.

3356
02:45:13,690 --> 02:45:17,260
I'm looking for holes in this idea very
much so and,

3357
02:45:17,370 --> 02:45:21,970
and I have done some serious thinking
about this over many years and I have

3358
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:25,120
interviewed most of the geologists that
have worked on it.

3359
02:45:25,121 --> 02:45:27,990
I've been in half a dozen field trips
guided by the,

3360
02:45:28,030 --> 02:45:30,370
the,
the main geologists that have worked on

3361
02:45:30,371 --> 02:45:33,020
this and had a chance to dialogue with
them and,

3362
02:45:33,090 --> 02:45:35,530
and you know,
I'm convinced that,

3363
02:45:35,560 --> 02:45:37,390
you know,
there's still some,

3364
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:39,830
there's a lot to be learned about this
and,

3365
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:42,310
and I think we need to be looking at,
like you said,

3366
02:45:42,311 --> 02:45:47,050
the big picture and we could get back to
a discussion of the finger lakes and how

3367
02:45:47,051 --> 02:45:48,700
they formed.
I think that's important.

3368
02:45:48,701 --> 02:45:51,730
I think we could get back to a
discussion about drum lens and how they

3369
02:45:51,731 --> 02:45:54,730
formed.
You know there is studies on the valley

3370
02:45:54,731 --> 02:45:57,400
heads,
maureen at are at the south end of the

3371
02:45:57,401 --> 02:46:01,150
finger lakes that have,
I can't think of who did it right now.

3372
02:46:01,151 --> 02:46:04,870
I could pull it up but basically said
there it's water deposited,

3373
02:46:04,930 --> 02:46:07,750
but,
but there's a lot of unresolved issues

3374
02:46:07,751 --> 02:46:10,550
about what happened during this
transition,

3375
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:14,660
planetary transition out of the last ice
age and I think it's important that we

3376
02:46:14,661 --> 02:46:18,140
have these discussions that we have
these dialogues and we try to get to the

3377
02:46:18,141 --> 02:46:23,090
bottom of what actually happened without
imposing too many preconceptions upon

3378
02:46:23,091 --> 02:46:26,450
our models because I think we're looking
at something very unprecedented here.

3379
02:46:27,480 --> 02:46:29,060
Randall,
I couldn't have said that better.

3380
02:46:29,061 --> 02:46:33,050
It was very well articulated.
Let me go back to the big picture.

3381
02:46:33,051 --> 02:46:37,310
If I could just for a minute,
because I want to address something that

3382
02:46:37,311 --> 02:46:42,311
graham said earlier and that is the gram
seems to have this idea that,

3383
02:46:43,070 --> 02:46:46,340
that comments break up all the time,
but,

3384
02:46:46,550 --> 02:46:48,890
but people didn't understand.
Um,

3385
02:46:49,200 --> 02:46:53,270
I,
I think comets and meteorites understand

3386
02:46:53,271 --> 02:46:54,104
that the,
the,

3387
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:58,400
the comment schumer levy or whatever it
was that broke up,

3388
02:46:59,490 --> 02:47:03,200
it broke up because of the gravitation
of jupiter.

3389
02:47:03,830 --> 02:47:08,270
We would not expect these comments to
break up andrea and into the atmosphere

3390
02:47:08,271 --> 02:47:11,630
is one of the problems that the common
people have had.

3391
02:47:11,970 --> 02:47:16,970
A firestone once suggested a four
kilometer wide comets striking the.

3392
02:47:18,531 --> 02:47:21,200
Now they've broken it up into multiple
comments.

3393
02:47:21,410 --> 02:47:26,300
The problem is you can't get it
separated if a comment breaks up,

3394
02:47:26,480 --> 02:47:30,380
it's very hard to separate it so that it
hits in multiple places.

3395
02:47:30,650 --> 02:47:35,240
And so,
so this is a big picture kind of problem

3396
02:47:35,450 --> 02:47:38,540
that the common people are having with
the scientists.

3397
02:47:38,660 --> 02:47:42,110
So you may be able to get it to hit,
uh,

3398
02:47:42,140 --> 02:47:47,140
the north american ice sheet.
But I'm telling you that the studies are

3399
02:47:47,271 --> 02:47:52,130
showing that you're not going to be able
to do this without leaving some marks.

3400
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:54,830
And so far nobody's been able to find a
credit.

3401
02:47:54,831 --> 02:47:57,560
Do you know that,
that they're suggesting that a four

3402
02:47:57,561 --> 02:47:59,780
kilometer comment,
if it couldn't break up,

3403
02:47:59,990 --> 02:48:04,990
it would generate 1 million a crater.
Meteor craters.

3404
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:09,170
You know how big that was?
That was 49,000 years ago.

3405
02:48:09,171 --> 02:48:10,640
We,
we don't see that in the,

3406
02:48:10,700 --> 02:48:13,640
in the climate record.
Forty 9,000 years ago,

3407
02:48:13,641 --> 02:48:18,641
we should see we don't see it.
It's a barely a little thing that they

3408
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:23,060
have a huge comet strike.
Malcolm malcolm has been standing by for

3409
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:24,470
best part of three hours.
I

3410
02:48:24,580 --> 02:48:26,380
since he's a member of the common
research group.

3411
02:48:26,381 --> 02:48:27,670
Wouldn't it be a good time to bring it
up?

3412
02:48:27,760 --> 02:48:30,580
Yeah,
we can bring them on as long as mark has

3413
02:48:30,581 --> 02:48:33,250
satisfied that he said his piece,
but unfortunately mark,

3414
02:48:33,251 --> 02:48:36,040
we can have two people on the phone at
the same time.

3415
02:48:36,780 --> 02:48:37,613
Okay.
Do you.

3416
02:48:37,920 --> 02:48:39,260
I really appreciate you having me on.

3417
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:43,650
I appreciate you coming on to and I'm
glad you guys especially you in randal

3418
02:48:43,651 --> 02:48:46,470
seem to have ironed out a lot of your
ideas.

3419
02:48:46,850 --> 02:48:49,740
I think there was a great guy.
There's a lot to be learned here

3420
02:48:49,741 --> 02:48:51,780
obviously,
and there's a lot that already has been

3421
02:48:51,781 --> 02:48:56,490
learned and this is an unbelievably
fascinating subject and I think

3422
02:48:56,580 --> 02:48:59,010
oftentimes when these debates get
heated,

3423
02:48:59,280 --> 02:49:01,590
a lot gets lost and who's wrong or who's
right,

3424
02:49:01,591 --> 02:49:04,860
but I think what we can all agree on is
that what we're dealing with is an

3425
02:49:04,861 --> 02:49:08,070
unbelievable point in and the history

3426
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:12,960
of this planet and trying to figure out
what caused it and why is some really

3427
02:49:12,961 --> 02:49:14,310
fascinating stuff.
So mark,

3428
02:49:14,311 --> 02:49:16,880
I really appreciate your time and really
appreciate you,

3429
02:49:16,920 --> 02:49:19,110
uh,
you imparting your knowledge on us,

3430
02:49:19,730 --> 02:49:22,350
if at all possible.
I would love to kind of keep some of

3431
02:49:22,351 --> 02:49:27,180
this dialogue going because I really
would value your input and trying to

3432
02:49:27,181 --> 02:49:28,470
write you randall,
um,

3433
02:49:28,590 --> 02:49:31,890
and I couldn't get through.
I'm not sure why I'm not either because

3434
02:49:31,891 --> 02:49:34,320
if I were to see that,
I definitely would've responded.

3435
02:49:34,321 --> 02:49:36,710
So please send me.
I'd love to.

3436
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:41,400
I will definitely connect you guys after
this is over and thank you once again,

3437
02:49:41,401 --> 02:49:41,851
mark.
Really,

3438
02:49:41,851 --> 02:49:44,610
really appreciate you calling them.
If I can just say I do hope you'll

3439
02:49:44,611 --> 02:49:47,340
revisit your article and just have a
look at the context in which you

3440
02:49:47,341 --> 02:49:48,890
presented me.
They're absolutely.

3441
02:49:50,300 --> 02:49:51,180
thank you,
mark.

3442
02:49:52,140 --> 02:49:53,260
okay,
now

3443
02:49:55,290 --> 02:49:57,210
we're going to call her number two.

3444
02:49:59,610 --> 02:50:04,350
This is a fascinating podcast stuff.
And your friend who is waiting is

3445
02:50:04,380 --> 02:50:05,680
malcolm mccomb.
Mark,

3446
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:08,940
one of the common research group
scientists.

3447
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:13,500
This is a large and diverse body of
scientists who come at it,

3448
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:17,310
the material with different expertise in
different areas of knowledge.

3449
02:50:17,390 --> 02:50:20,340
Uh,
it happenS that malcolm is a co author

3450
02:50:20,430 --> 02:50:24,510
of the recent diary regarded highly
significant paper finding a platinum

3451
02:50:24,511 --> 02:50:29,511
anomaly across north America and I would
hope you might begin with addressing why

3452
02:50:31,560 --> 02:50:35,130
that might indicate a comet impact.
Right.

3453
02:50:35,730 --> 02:50:37,350
Is malcolm on you?
Shouldn't be malcolm.

3454
02:50:37,351 --> 02:50:40,190
Can you hear us?
I can hear your.

3455
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:41,160
Excellent.
How are you,

3456
02:50:41,161 --> 02:50:42,960
malcolm?
Thank you very much for joining us.

3457
02:50:44,540 --> 02:50:46,360
Have been here.
Uh,

3458
02:50:46,560 --> 02:50:49,710
so give us your thoughts on what graeme
just said,

3459
02:50:49,711 --> 02:50:52,020
if you would,
as to why,

3460
02:50:52,230 --> 02:50:55,950
uh,
why it makes sense that it was a comment

3461
02:50:55,980 --> 02:51:00,870
that hit and why there would be these
large deposits of these.

3462
02:51:01,220 --> 02:51:04,560
What was it exactly in that time in the
recent paper,

3463
02:51:04,561 --> 02:51:06,510
but,
but malcolm is also an expert in

3464
02:51:06,511 --> 02:51:09,830
magnetic microsphere yules and I think
he can address that issue as well.

3465
02:51:10,090 --> 02:51:13,560
The whole range of proxies of impact
proxies and malcolm,

3466
02:51:13,561 --> 02:51:15,960
please just give us your thoughts on
this entire phenomenon,

3467
02:51:15,961 --> 02:51:18,450
if you will.
I will.

3468
02:51:22,210 --> 02:51:24,450
Happy to be here.
Happy to have you.

3469
02:51:28,340 --> 02:51:29,570
Is he breaking up?
No,

3470
02:51:29,630 --> 02:51:30,950
go ahead.
Go ahead.

3471
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:33,590
Malcolm.
I think there's an issue.

3472
02:51:34,460 --> 02:51:35,810
Seems to be.
Can you go.

3473
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:38,630
I know what's going on.
I've got a feedback.

3474
02:51:38,631 --> 02:51:40,230
I forgot to turn off this.
Okay.

3475
02:51:40,260 --> 02:51:41,780
Oh yeah.
You got to meet that other video.

3476
02:51:42,630 --> 02:51:43,670
Oh,
okay.

3477
02:51:43,750 --> 02:51:45,590
Okay.
You were listening to us at the same

3478
02:51:45,591 --> 02:51:47,510
time as talking to us here.
You're going to get.

3479
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:49,850
You're,
you're getting us on like a 42nd delay

3480
02:51:49,851 --> 02:51:52,330
or something?
Yeah.

3481
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:53,633
Okay.
We call them out.

3482
02:51:54,320 --> 02:51:57,020
Actually,
I was very interested to hear mark's,

3483
02:51:57,260 --> 02:51:59,450
uh,
his initial statement kind of put me

3484
02:51:59,451 --> 02:52:00,284
off,
but his,

3485
02:52:00,290 --> 02:52:02,480
uh,
his subsequent statements I thought

3486
02:52:02,500 --> 02:52:03,333
were,
were,

3487
02:52:03,410 --> 02:52:05,980
were pretty accurate and there is,
there are

3488
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:08,170
many problems with the,
uh,

3489
02:52:08,740 --> 02:52:12,150
the hypothesis that there was an impact
and that's the way I consider it.

3490
02:52:12,160 --> 02:52:15,220
I don't really think in terms of a
common impact,

3491
02:52:15,221 --> 02:52:18,160
I think in terms of an extraterrestrial
impact because I don't think we've

3492
02:52:18,161 --> 02:52:20,260
proven a cognitive pack.
I don't think we've proven.

3493
02:52:20,540 --> 02:52:22,810
We don't think we know what kind of an
impacted was.

3494
02:52:22,840 --> 02:52:25,840
There's too many questions that have to
be answered.

3495
02:52:26,530 --> 02:52:30,670
Uh,
so I can't sign up to say that I'm

3496
02:52:30,671 --> 02:52:34,720
defending the comet impact hypothesis
because I don't frankly know what it

3497
02:52:34,721 --> 02:52:35,980
was.
A,

3498
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:39,220
we have a lot of evidence that appears
to be extra terrestrial in nature.

3499
02:52:39,520 --> 02:52:41,350
We have magnetic,
micro sterols.

3500
02:52:41,750 --> 02:52:45,520
Um,
I can give you the most frequent

3501
02:52:45,550 --> 02:52:48,970
criticism we get is that the,
the evidence has not been replicated.

3502
02:52:48,971 --> 02:52:51,400
And that's where I thought mark was
going when he,

3503
02:52:51,650 --> 02:52:55,420
his initial statement was that the
comment impact hypothesis has been

3504
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:56,373
debunked.

3505
02:52:56,830 --> 02:52:59,530
And I think what he meant was if I can
speak for him,

3506
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:03,100
um,
was that the fact that it was a comment

3507
02:53:03,190 --> 02:53:05,410
has been debunked.
I don't think that's necessarily true

3508
02:53:05,411 --> 02:53:07,730
yet.
It just isn't indicated that,

3509
02:53:07,731 --> 02:53:09,010
uh,
that it was a comment.

3510
02:53:09,011 --> 02:53:13,360
It's we have indications that it was
more of an asteroid hit than anything

3511
02:53:13,361 --> 02:53:16,240
else.
And I can conceive of a rubble pile that

3512
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:19,950
somehow became a,
this associated all of there be,

3513
02:53:20,260 --> 02:53:22,570
there have to be a mechanism or a model
for that.

3514
02:53:22,571 --> 02:53:24,040
And I don't think we have a model for
that.

3515
02:53:24,640 --> 02:53:28,270
Um,
asteroids come in many flavors and a

3516
02:53:28,330 --> 02:53:31,480
rubble piles or certainly one loose
loose aggregate,

3517
02:53:31,481 --> 02:53:34,030
some material that could become
separated possibly.

3518
02:53:34,630 --> 02:53:35,463
But,
uh,

3519
02:53:36,280 --> 02:53:38,650
I just don't know.
I just don't know at this stage.

3520
02:53:39,070 --> 02:53:40,040
Um,
I

3521
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:47,610
guess the biggest criticism that we
faced in terms of the impact hypothesis

3522
02:53:49,340 --> 02:53:54,340
is that the evidence has not been
replicable and we now have,

3523
02:53:55,580 --> 02:53:58,230
I guess for three or four,
uh,

3524
02:53:59,430 --> 02:54:04,430
evidence lines that had been replicated
By numerous independent groups.

3525
02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:08,420
Google's the nano diamonds,
whiCh may be the most controversial of a

3526
02:54:08,421 --> 02:54:13,421
bunch of the evidence lines that's been,
that's been replicated by four different

3527
02:54:14,241 --> 02:54:15,230
groups,
independent,

3528
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:17,570
uh,
five different studies.

3529
02:54:18,270 --> 02:54:21,110
The magnetIc microspheres which were
initially

3530
02:54:22,610 --> 02:54:25,640
treated very hostile late because they
didn't understand what we were talking

3531
02:54:25,641 --> 02:54:27,830
about.
And some of that was a self inflicted

3532
02:54:27,831 --> 02:54:30,560
wound on a part of the initial study,
uh,

3533
02:54:30,561 --> 02:54:34,640
which didn't show.
We were really refining and uh,

3534
02:54:34,641 --> 02:54:38,510
that's been corrected.
And there's the same objection or

3535
02:54:38,511 --> 02:54:43,511
criticism is being made.
Magnetic microsphere roles are typically

3536
02:54:44,300 --> 02:54:47,660
very well.
They're melted and then their quenched,

3537
02:54:48,200 --> 02:54:48,730
uh,
they,

3538
02:54:48,730 --> 02:54:51,800
they said that they're subjected to high
temperatures and then those temperatures

3539
02:54:51,801 --> 02:54:53,510
are,
are rapidly reduced,

3540
02:54:53,630 --> 02:54:56,750
which is sort of accepted to be
characteristics of an impact.

3541
02:54:57,290 --> 02:55:01,130
So we've got that evidence of an impact
and that's been replicated by 10

3542
02:55:01,131 --> 02:55:06,131
different independent groups and
including many of the same sites

3543
02:55:08,060 --> 02:55:09,290
that were originally disputed.

3544
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:14,150
So then the,
the disputation has been largely based

3545
02:55:14,151 --> 02:55:18,290
upon the failure to do the most basic
part of the protocol,

3546
02:55:18,560 --> 02:55:20,670
which is to,
uh,

3547
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:24,710
to do the scanning electron microscopic
analysis of the spheros.

3548
02:55:25,910 --> 02:55:26,590
Okay.
that,

3549
02:55:26,590 --> 02:55:29,490
that is the microsphere,
the,

3550
02:55:29,680 --> 02:55:34,280
and the nano diamonds.
The other is the discovery of platinum

3551
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:37,670
iridium osmium,
which are the platinum group elements

3552
02:55:37,880 --> 02:55:40,010
which are characteristic of an asteroid
impact.

3553
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:43,070
And we found some evidence of,
of,

3554
02:55:43,071 --> 02:55:44,060
uh,
of iridium,

3555
02:55:44,480 --> 02:55:45,650
not,
not a lot,

3556
02:55:45,710 --> 02:55:48,320
but there had been certain sites that
are rich and iridium at the.

3557
02:55:48,540 --> 02:55:50,930
And once again,
this is at the younger dryas boundary,

3558
02:55:51,140 --> 02:55:52,340
not above,
not below.

3559
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:57,470
It's there at that boundary so that they
seem to be pretty solid.

3560
02:55:57,850 --> 02:56:01,670
And iridium is indicative of an impact
of extraterrestrial origin,

3561
02:56:01,671 --> 02:56:03,290
correct?
That's correct.

3562
02:56:04,220 --> 02:56:06,670
The platinum is simply just another
more,

3563
02:56:06,750 --> 02:56:09,320
more plentiful,
a platinum group elements,

3564
02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:11,480
obviously that's why they're called the
platinum groups.

3565
02:56:11,740 --> 02:56:14,390
Uh,
osmium is one that is usually associated

3566
02:56:14,391 --> 02:56:18,320
with iridium.
There are now 11 studies by independent

3567
02:56:18,321 --> 02:56:20,760
groups that have confirmed the,
uh,

3568
02:56:20,920 --> 02:56:23,600
the occurrence of platinum osmium we're
already in,

3569
02:56:24,620 --> 02:56:29,300
so it looks to me like the evidence is
piling up on the most recent one,

3570
02:56:29,301 --> 02:56:34,301
of course is to platinum study by more.
That just came out a few months ago now.

3571
02:56:35,001 --> 02:56:35,834
Random girls.

3572
02:56:36,230 --> 02:56:38,990
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but randall carlson just had us pull up

3573
02:56:39,260 --> 02:56:41,450
some images that we're looking at.
RAndall,

3574
02:56:41,451 --> 02:56:43,160
please explain what this is.
Well,

3575
02:56:43,161 --> 02:56:48,161
this is from malcolm's 2012 independent
evaluation of conflicting microsphere

3576
02:56:49,381 --> 02:56:51,200
real results from different
investigations.

3577
02:56:51,710 --> 02:56:55,580
This is his supplementary information
figure for.

3578
02:56:55,880 --> 02:56:58,490
So it's just so that the people watching
this can,

3579
02:56:58,540 --> 02:57:03,140
can actually see what you're talking
about when you're discussing the rapid

3580
02:57:03,141 --> 02:57:05,930
quenching effect on the surface of the
microsphere oils.

3581
02:57:06,360 --> 02:57:10,940
So we've got up on the screen here,
supplementary information,

3582
02:57:10,941 --> 02:57:14,450
figure four where you've got the
microspheres from topher,

3583
02:57:14,540 --> 02:57:18,280
blackwater draw and papaw cove.
So just,

3584
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:21,140
just so people can see what that surface
texture looks like.

3585
02:57:21,141 --> 02:57:21,974
Like

3586
02:57:22,990 --> 02:57:23,441
a.
Yeah,

3587
02:57:23,441 --> 02:57:25,090
you see these,
they looked like leaf,

3588
02:57:25,091 --> 02:57:28,930
like structures across.
Some of them are harder to see,

3589
02:57:28,960 --> 02:57:31,070
but they're there.
If you see the original image,

3590
02:57:31,071 --> 02:57:34,060
it's large enough and clear enough to
actually see these,

3591
02:57:34,090 --> 02:57:38,840
what we call dendritic structures or,
or a almost like a carpet.

3592
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:42,400
We've,
those are essentially truncated

3593
02:57:42,401 --> 02:57:44,320
crystallization.
It's a,

3594
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:46,960
it's a crystallization process that's
clenched.

3595
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:50,080
I'm not a geologist,
had geologists try to explain it to me

3596
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:53,050
and uh,
that's what I'm trying to do here.

3597
02:57:53,470 --> 02:57:55,330
But uh,
yeah,

3598
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:56,050
the,
uh,

3599
02:57:56,050 --> 02:57:57,940
the fact that these are enhanced,
these,

3600
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:02,550
these things are quite enhanced at the
average rise and really depleted above

3601
02:58:02,551 --> 02:58:05,580
and below.
Now there are spheros throughout the

3602
02:58:05,581 --> 02:58:07,170
column,
one column of,

3603
02:58:07,250 --> 02:58:11,550
of soil.
When you go down vertically a deeper,

3604
02:58:12,030 --> 02:58:15,390
you find spheros.
Those spheros are typically what we call

3605
02:58:15,391 --> 02:58:17,400
orthogenic,
which means that are created by

3606
02:58:17,401 --> 02:58:21,210
terrestrial processes.
You need to do a scanning electron

3607
02:58:21,211 --> 02:58:25,260
microscope and
x ray,

3608
02:58:25,740 --> 02:58:30,740
a dispersive
spectroscopy to differentiate those from

3609
02:58:34,320 --> 02:58:34,860
the,
uh,

3610
02:58:34,860 --> 02:58:37,350
the terrestrial processes that are
producing these things.

3611
02:58:37,460 --> 02:58:40,640
Yeah.
Your figure five has a frand boydell

3612
02:58:40,641 --> 02:58:42,470
sphero,
which is probably what you're talking

3613
02:58:42,471 --> 02:58:44,870
about.
If you could go to slide 13,

3614
02:58:44,871 --> 02:58:46,020
jamie,
and,

3615
02:58:46,140 --> 02:58:47,480
and you'll be able to see.
Yeah,

3616
02:58:47,481 --> 02:58:49,610
there it is.
You can see very distinct difference.

3617
02:58:49,611 --> 02:58:51,800
So we've got your figure five up on the
screen now,

3618
02:58:51,801 --> 02:58:52,634
malcolm,

3619
02:58:54,160 --> 02:58:56,200
the
when,

3620
02:58:56,780 --> 02:59:00,320
when you look at optical microscope,
they look just like the are very much

3621
02:59:00,321 --> 02:59:01,270
like the,
uh,

3622
02:59:02,660 --> 02:59:05,030
the,
what we call impacts fuels are magnetic

3623
02:59:05,031 --> 02:59:08,780
microsphere rules and they occur much
more frequently.

3624
02:59:08,781 --> 02:59:09,270
I mean,
I've got,

3625
02:59:09,270 --> 02:59:12,590
I've got sites that have tens of
thoUsands of these things in every

3626
02:59:12,591 --> 02:59:17,591
couple of centimeters of sediment.
So you've got to separate the,

3627
02:59:17,931 --> 02:59:18,920
uh,
this,

3628
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:19,750
the,
the,

3629
02:59:19,750 --> 02:59:23,900
the impact spheros and the magnetic
microsphere oils from these things.

3630
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:27,230
But what you appear to be saying about
them is that there is an abundance of

3631
02:59:27,231 --> 02:59:31,340
impact proxy evidence,
which in your opinion adds up to a

3632
02:59:31,340 --> 02:59:34,130
cosmic impact of some sort,
not necessarily a comment you're

3633
02:59:34,131 --> 02:59:36,770
suggesting an asteroid.
It's a mysterious event in that sense.

3634
02:59:36,771 --> 02:59:39,650
But what it adds up to is an impact in
your view.

3635
02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:41,270
Is that a fair,
a fair?

3636
02:59:41,490 --> 02:59:43,300
These,
what we call proxies,

3637
02:59:43,301 --> 02:59:45,110
the,
the impacts spherules the,

3638
02:59:45,111 --> 02:59:47,420
a platinum group elements,
the,

3639
02:59:47,421 --> 02:59:49,160
uh,
the melt glass,

3640
02:59:49,161 --> 02:59:50,300
which I haven't discussed yet.

3641
02:59:50,750 --> 02:59:55,610
And the nano diamonds are enhanced and
the enhancement has been replicated on

3642
02:59:55,611 --> 02:59:58,460
numerous occasions for each of these,
these proxies.

3643
02:59:58,880 --> 03:00:02,420
So anyone who says that the work of you
and your team has been completely

3644
03:00:02,421 --> 03:00:04,910
debunked is,
is clearly not completely familiar with

3645
03:00:04,911 --> 03:00:08,900
the literature that that's,
that would seem to be the case that are,

3646
03:00:08,960 --> 03:00:13,280
we're a disingenuous in that regard.
So I would say that that,

3647
03:00:13,300 --> 03:00:15,920
uh,
because typically what we see is that

3648
03:00:16,410 --> 03:00:20,600
the,
the opposition literature does not cite

3649
03:00:20,780 --> 03:00:22,480
the studies that have come out.
Yeah.

3650
03:00:23,270 --> 03:00:28,270
We try and cite both the critical
studies and ours and give reasons why

3651
03:00:29,570 --> 03:00:34,400
our studies supplant.
There's habit I wish they would share.

3652
03:00:34,930 --> 03:00:35,780
But,
uh,

3653
03:00:36,080 --> 03:00:37,490
could you go into hasn't been the case

3654
03:00:37,580 --> 03:00:40,280
slide 82.
It would be nice if we could have had

3655
03:00:40,281 --> 03:00:43,100
you on with mark so you guys can
exchange information.

3656
03:00:43,101 --> 03:00:46,220
But unfortunately our capabilities that
we can only take one phone call at a

3657
03:00:46,221 --> 03:00:49,460
time,
we will definitely try to update that

3658
03:00:49,461 --> 03:00:51,890
for the new studio.
Although we never anticipated this was

3659
03:00:51,891 --> 03:00:54,400
going to happen in the first place.
But uh,

3660
03:00:54,670 --> 03:00:55,431
are awesome.
Oh,

3661
03:00:55,431 --> 03:00:56,900
there we go.
Up on the screen.

3662
03:00:57,110 --> 03:00:57,943
Malcolm,
we've got

3663
03:00:59,510 --> 03:01:04,510
from ted bunch at our 2012 very high
temperature impact melt products as

3664
03:01:04,931 --> 03:01:07,510
evidence for cosmic airburst sandy
impacts 12,000,

3665
03:01:07,511 --> 03:01:09,290
900 years ago.
Uh,

3666
03:01:09,340 --> 03:01:12,820
so we have figure a supplementary
information,

3667
03:01:13,180 --> 03:01:16,480
six,
the light photo micrographs of magnetic

3668
03:01:16,481 --> 03:01:19,180
and glassy spherules from melrose,
Pennsylvania,

3669
03:01:19,390 --> 03:01:22,240
and it shows the,
the wide variety of shapes,

3670
03:01:22,360 --> 03:01:25,420
which includes spheros ovals,
teardrops in dumbbells.

3671
03:01:26,410 --> 03:01:29,500
And I think so you can see pretty
distinctly what you're talking about

3672
03:01:29,501 --> 03:01:31,330
here with the,
with the glassy spheros.

3673
03:01:32,770 --> 03:01:35,840
And then like particularly,
I don't,

3674
03:01:35,970 --> 03:01:39,750
I'm not sure if you were co author of
this paper or not.

3675
03:01:41,140 --> 03:01:42,100
You were not.
Okay.

3676
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:44,110
Are you familiar with that paper?
Do you know?

3677
03:01:44,111 --> 03:01:45,520
The good.
Okay.

3678
03:01:45,880 --> 03:01:47,310
Yeah,
I chose some very interesting,

3679
03:01:47,311 --> 03:01:48,310
you know,
teardrop shapes,

3680
03:01:48,311 --> 03:01:52,770
dumbbell shapes and where you can
actually see that like dumbbell h up

3681
03:01:52,780 --> 03:01:55,780
there consists of two dissimilar
accretionary spheros,

3682
03:01:55,781 --> 03:02:00,610
one clear silicon rich and the other
opaque iron rich that have been fused

3683
03:02:00,611 --> 03:02:01,250
together.
And that's,

3684
03:02:01,250 --> 03:02:03,140
that's pretty convincing evidence of
the,

3685
03:02:03,270 --> 03:02:08,140
of the energy that's involved in these
phenomena that you actually have these

3686
03:02:08,141 --> 03:02:11,290
fused spheros like this.
And then jamie,

3687
03:02:11,291 --> 03:02:15,520
if you go down to the next image,
which is a scanning electron microscope

3688
03:02:15,521 --> 03:02:20,380
images comparing younger dryas boundary
spirits on the top row with known

3689
03:02:20,381 --> 03:02:23,890
impacts virals on the bottom row.
This is a very interesting comparison

3690
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:27,850
because you've probably seen this when
malcolm a.

3691
03:02:28,260 --> 03:02:30,400
There's,
there's three across the top three

3692
03:02:30,401 --> 03:02:35,401
across the bottom and a is actually a
from knutson's or knudsen farm and

3693
03:02:36,011 --> 03:02:39,010
candidates,
a young cretaceous tertiary boundary,

3694
03:02:39,190 --> 03:02:43,700
sphero and just below it is a younger
dryas spiro from lakewood,

3695
03:02:43,720 --> 03:02:47,080
ceo in Mexico,
and one can see the morphological

3696
03:02:47,081 --> 03:02:52,081
similarity of the two quite clearly.
Then c and d compares a c is a spiritual

3697
03:02:53,461 --> 03:02:58,461
from the tunguska air burst,
and then d is younger dryas boundary

3698
03:02:58,901 --> 03:03:00,070
from lindzen,
Germany,

3699
03:03:00,071 --> 03:03:03,040
which dates to 12,800 years before
present.

3700
03:03:03,310 --> 03:03:05,060
And here you can see very clearly the,
the,

3701
03:03:05,061 --> 03:03:07,060
the,
the rapid quench melt,

3702
03:03:07,240 --> 03:03:10,720
a texture on the surface between the two
comparison,

3703
03:03:10,750 --> 03:03:15,750
comparing togusa airburst with a younger
dryas boundary object.

3704
03:03:16,090 --> 03:03:20,770
And then finally enf,
we have an iron calcium silico sphero

3705
03:03:20,771 --> 03:03:25,771
from meteor crater compared with an iron
calcium silica younger dryas boundary

3706
03:03:27,220 --> 03:03:29,980
sphero from abou herea,
Syria.

3707
03:03:29,981 --> 03:03:31,960
And again,
in each of these cases you can see the

3708
03:03:31,961 --> 03:03:35,080
similarities between the different types
of objects.

3709
03:03:35,081 --> 03:03:39,610
So you have these three objects which
are come from that younger dryas

3710
03:03:39,611 --> 03:03:42,970
boundary layer,
all which have morphological similarity

3711
03:03:42,971 --> 03:03:47,971
to known impact proxies.
And this is very difficult to dismiss

3712
03:03:48,341 --> 03:03:51,880
this as being mere coincidence.
Yeah,

3713
03:03:51,881 --> 03:03:53,440
I would agree.
And uh,

3714
03:03:53,800 --> 03:03:54,970
those,
those are very,

3715
03:03:55,240 --> 03:03:57,230
especially the ac bed

3716
03:03:58,810 --> 03:04:01,280
pictures are very similar to the
material that I'm taking out of the

3717
03:04:01,281 --> 03:04:03,530
younger dryas boundary of the sites that
I've been looking at.

3718
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:05,740
Malcolm,
what evidence,

3719
03:04:05,741 --> 03:04:09,130
if any,
are you aware of about what is that

3720
03:04:09,131 --> 03:04:13,540
nuclear glass material called trying try
to the trinity.

3721
03:04:13,600 --> 03:04:15,320
That's how you say it.
What I,

3722
03:04:15,340 --> 03:04:17,020
I,
from what I understand,

3723
03:04:17,050 --> 03:04:21,610
there's quite a bit of that that also
appears in the same time period.

3724
03:04:21,611 --> 03:04:22,510
And the core samples,

3725
03:04:23,430 --> 03:04:26,130
there are some instances of it,
but I wouldn't say quite a bit.

3726
03:04:27,150 --> 03:04:29,820
Some of these are very site specific and
one of the,

3727
03:04:30,300 --> 03:04:33,450
one of the things I've been trying to do
is work my way closer and closer to

3728
03:04:33,451 --> 03:04:35,550
Canada to see if there's any truth to
the,

3729
03:04:35,750 --> 03:04:40,750
to this whole idea that the primary
impact site was Canada.

3730
03:04:41,700 --> 03:04:46,650
So I've been trying to look at sites
closer and closer and I've seen sites in

3731
03:04:46,651 --> 03:04:48,540
New Jersey,
this would be eastern Canada.

3732
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:52,890
I've seen sites in New Jersey,
New York and Pennsylvania that produce

3733
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:55,330
a,
what appears to be some form of trinet

3734
03:04:55,331 --> 03:04:59,730
tight or,
or melt glass or what a ted bunch a

3735
03:04:59,731 --> 03:05:03,830
would call scoria like objects.
And it seems to,

3736
03:05:03,920 --> 03:05:04,500
to,
uh,

3737
03:05:04,500 --> 03:05:06,210
to bear out that,
that,

3738
03:05:06,250 --> 03:05:07,860
uh,
at least that far,

3739
03:05:08,160 --> 03:05:10,350
uh,
we're getting richer material out of the

3740
03:05:10,351 --> 03:05:12,540
sediment out of the younger dryas
boundary settlement.

3741
03:05:12,750 --> 03:05:13,583
Is this trinity

3742
03:05:13,610 --> 03:05:16,770
tights material only produced in this
manner?

3743
03:05:16,960 --> 03:05:19,100
It's also produced their nuclear
explosion test.

3744
03:05:19,101 --> 03:05:20,870
Right?
But other than that,

3745
03:05:20,871 --> 03:05:22,790
is this the only way that it's produced
on earth?

3746
03:05:24,250 --> 03:05:25,480
Well,
an impact would do it.

3747
03:05:25,500 --> 03:05:28,470
A or a full garage could delay.
What is the right is,

3748
03:05:28,690 --> 03:05:33,690
is what's produced by a pipe like a
lightening strike can produce

3749
03:05:35,590 --> 03:05:38,260
a,
a spherules that could produce all the

3750
03:05:38,261 --> 03:05:41,230
high temperature products that you see
an impact,

3751
03:05:41,680 --> 03:05:43,450
um,
but in a very limited way,

3752
03:05:43,451 --> 03:05:46,420
you wouldn't expect to see it in a,
in a layer less than was some sort of

3753
03:05:46,421 --> 03:05:48,700
global lightening storm.
Um,

3754
03:05:49,390 --> 03:05:50,050
the,
uh,

3755
03:05:50,050 --> 03:05:51,920
what I was going to say about the,
uh,

3756
03:05:52,430 --> 03:05:56,920
the melt glass is that in the material
we're looking at,

3757
03:05:57,190 --> 03:05:59,350
you see evidence of,
of melted,

3758
03:05:59,380 --> 03:06:02,150
a zircons,
melted chrome,

3759
03:06:02,590 --> 03:06:04,630
all of which are very high temperature,
uh,

3760
03:06:04,930 --> 03:06:08,670
features high,
indicating a very high temperature that

3761
03:06:08,740 --> 03:06:10,870
was experienced by that particular
object.

3762
03:06:11,170 --> 03:06:13,120
Or are you seeing the image we have up
here?

3763
03:06:14,120 --> 03:06:14,970
Yes,
I agree.

3764
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:15,873
Okay,
good.

3765
03:06:16,820 --> 03:06:17,240
Okay.

3766
03:06:17,240 --> 03:06:19,560
Yeah,
there are a is for meteor crater and b

3767
03:06:19,561 --> 03:06:22,430
is from the trinity nuclear test.
So,

3768
03:06:22,431 --> 03:06:23,330
and then,
uh,

3769
03:06:23,450 --> 03:06:28,450
with the 22 kiloton yield and nancy is
from one of the soviet era nuclear

3770
03:06:28,761 --> 03:06:31,130
tests.
And d is again,

3771
03:06:31,131 --> 03:06:33,730
a scoria like object from apo hurriya.
Yeah.

3772
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:35,560
So yeah.
So,

3773
03:06:35,650 --> 03:06:37,240
and then if we go to,
uh,

3774
03:06:37,690 --> 03:06:39,760
let's see,
um,

3775
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:41,410
you gotta love that.
It says stalin,

3776
03:06:41,420 --> 03:06:42,430
I,
yeah,

3777
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:44,201
jamie.
Maria,

3778
03:06:44,201 --> 03:06:45,310
like objects,
the,

3779
03:06:45,311 --> 03:06:46,580
uh,
the milk glass screen.

3780
03:06:46,581 --> 03:06:49,930
I like objects has only been found in
about half a dozen sites at this point.

3781
03:06:50,800 --> 03:06:51,700
So we're still,
you know,

3782
03:06:51,701 --> 03:06:55,220
and I think it's a matter of how close
you are to an impact point and you're

3783
03:06:55,640 --> 03:06:58,890
very far apart.
That would lend credence to the idea of

3784
03:06:58,891 --> 03:07:03,510
multiple impacts if they seem to be
getting more and more plentiful as you

3785
03:07:03,511 --> 03:07:07,240
get further and further north and maybe
there's more moral legitimacy to a,

3786
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:10,140
to a primary impact site.
Right now.

3787
03:07:10,141 --> 03:07:11,260
We just don't know.
You know,

3788
03:07:11,270 --> 03:07:14,880
we're still,
we're still working that out.

3789
03:07:16,480 --> 03:07:18,350
All right.
We got another nice slide from,

3790
03:07:18,430 --> 03:07:21,290
from the bunch article here.
the slide.

3791
03:07:21,291 --> 03:07:24,530
Yeah.
Calcium oxide rich scoria like object

3792
03:07:24,531 --> 03:07:28,220
created by the melting of carbonate and
silica rich precursor rocks,

3793
03:07:28,680 --> 03:07:30,590
the yellow areas,
the calcium oxide,

3794
03:07:30,591 --> 03:07:32,570
the white areas,
le chateau earlier,

3795
03:07:32,571 --> 03:07:35,660
right.
And dark areas are iron oxide.

3796
03:07:35,960 --> 03:07:38,240
So that's a really nice.
Legit.

3797
03:07:39,170 --> 03:07:40,850
Yeah.
I had been struggling With getting that

3798
03:07:42,220 --> 03:07:43,520
down.
um,

3799
03:07:44,300 --> 03:07:46,460
and then jamie,
if you go to the next one,

3800
03:07:46,850 --> 03:07:51,320
we will see there is a scoria like
object for a meteor crater,

3801
03:07:51,321 --> 03:07:55,730
Arizona and you could toggle back and
forth between the two so that people can

3802
03:07:55,731 --> 03:07:57,530
kind of see the similarity between them.

3803
03:07:58,560 --> 03:08:01,650
And I see a lot in the sites that
produce milk glass.

3804
03:08:01,651 --> 03:08:03,030
that's what I'm seeing.
Yeah.

3805
03:08:03,750 --> 03:08:06,770
those two,
those two types of a particular 10,

3806
03:08:06,780 --> 03:08:09,210
how much of this material are you
finding in these sites?

3807
03:08:10,130 --> 03:08:11,400
Well,
you don't plan,

3808
03:08:11,910 --> 03:08:14,070
I have to say you don't find a lot of
this material.

3809
03:08:14,071 --> 03:08:15,600
It takes,
it's a struggle to get it,

3810
03:08:16,080 --> 03:08:18,510
but what you don't find is anything
above or below it,

3811
03:08:18,750 --> 03:08:21,290
that particular layer,
uh,

3812
03:08:21,291 --> 03:08:24,420
unless you know that there's been a very
dynamic environment which case it can be

3813
03:08:24,421 --> 03:08:26,040
spread out,
uh,

3814
03:08:26,100 --> 03:08:27,420
in the,
in the soil column.

3815
03:08:27,480 --> 03:08:29,850
And what's the implication of nothing
above it and below it.

3816
03:08:30,840 --> 03:08:31,740
Well that,
that,

3817
03:08:31,741 --> 03:08:33,720
uh,
you've got a specific date for a

3818
03:08:33,721 --> 03:08:35,320
specific date for it.
And,

3819
03:08:35,321 --> 03:08:36,330
uh,
the layer that we,

3820
03:08:36,810 --> 03:08:39,960
we typically try and just live at our
investigation to layers that have been

3821
03:08:39,961 --> 03:08:44,130
dated to the younger dryas boundary or
contained her dryas boundary layer.

3822
03:08:44,280 --> 03:08:46,710
Right?
But lIke I say,

3823
03:08:46,720 --> 03:08:49,410
if you have a very dynamic environment,
it can really screw things up.

3824
03:08:50,020 --> 03:08:52,950
Um,
you can be very difficult to interpret.

3825
03:08:53,310 --> 03:08:55,680
So this has been a lot of flooding,
repetitive flooding,

3826
03:08:55,710 --> 03:08:59,010
difficult science to do.
So again,

3827
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:01,530
this is difficult science to do.
Uh,

3828
03:09:01,531 --> 03:09:02,390
yeah.
And,

3829
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:03,090
and,
uh,

3830
03:09:03,090 --> 03:09:06,150
I should add there that proving an
impact is not easy.

3831
03:09:06,330 --> 03:09:10,200
It takes a while and,
and it just is proving an impact crater

3832
03:09:10,201 --> 03:09:12,920
is not easy,
as I'm sure mark would agree that you'd

3833
03:09:12,921 --> 03:09:15,390
find a crater.
There's no guarantee that's either an

3834
03:09:15,391 --> 03:09:20,391
impact impact a event or a or a volcanic
had been until you do the research and

3835
03:09:20,701 --> 03:09:24,000
spend the time to investigate it.
But if you could summarize for us what's

3836
03:09:24,001 --> 03:09:27,180
your opinion now on the balance of the
evidence?

3837
03:09:27,240 --> 03:09:29,940
Always bearing in mind that you may
change that opinion as more evidence

3838
03:09:29,941 --> 03:09:31,380
comes in.
Yeah,

3839
03:09:31,410 --> 03:09:35,640
I would say we were facing an
unprecedented type of event here that

3840
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:39,270
appears to have been a,
something approaching global.

3841
03:09:39,670 --> 03:09:41,850
I mean we've got evidence now in south
America.

3842
03:09:41,851 --> 03:09:43,680
We've got evidence,
uh,

3843
03:09:43,890 --> 03:09:45,730
and a lot of this stuff is unpublished.
I mean,

3844
03:09:45,731 --> 03:09:47,790
I,
there's a lot of things that I could

3845
03:09:47,791 --> 03:09:51,030
bring up that aren't published,
so that is kind of useless to refer to

3846
03:09:51,031 --> 03:09:53,680
them because there's no way of checking
what I'm saying,

3847
03:09:53,800 --> 03:09:58,000
but we're seeing stuff that goes very
far into south America

3848
03:10:00,450 --> 03:10:03,090
and we're seeing things in Syria.
We haven't looked elsewhere.

3849
03:10:03,091 --> 03:10:07,170
We've seen about the pacIfic ocean,
we've seen it in europe.

3850
03:10:07,171 --> 03:10:09,690
So I mean where does it end?
And it's all.

3851
03:10:09,691 --> 03:10:12,300
We haven't found it yet.
And it's all at the younger dryas

3852
03:10:12,301 --> 03:10:13,920
boundary.
That's correct,

3853
03:10:13,921 --> 03:10:15,930
yeah.
What have you found in the pacific

3854
03:10:15,931 --> 03:10:19,420
ocean?
A while sharma has found.

3855
03:10:19,440 --> 03:10:23,650
So it was a paper I can cite from this
is a need,

3856
03:10:23,800 --> 03:10:27,360
just a presentation a quarter.
He says,

3857
03:10:27,361 --> 03:10:31,530
we infer that the central pacific was a
sign of deposition of osmium resulting

3858
03:10:31,531 --> 03:10:35,550
from dusk,
from dust cloud falling immediate

3859
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:38,120
impacted 12,
$12,000.

3860
03:10:38,150 --> 03:10:42,120
Animals plus or minus $4,000,
so right in that,

3861
03:10:42,240 --> 03:10:45,820
right in that ballpark,
sharma says that,

3862
03:10:45,821 --> 03:10:49,060
uh,
he found osmium and I believe he's,

3863
03:10:49,110 --> 03:10:51,960
he's come up with microsphere met at
same core,

3864
03:10:52,320 --> 03:10:54,720
but uh,
so the central pacific is an idea that

3865
03:10:54,990 --> 03:10:57,900
gives you an idea of how extensive this,
this thing was.

3866
03:10:58,050 --> 03:11:00,510
Now malcolm,
this is obviously some controversial

3867
03:11:00,511 --> 03:11:01,980
material.
It's a,

3868
03:11:01,981 --> 03:11:04,500
it's,
it's fairly new in terms of the public

3869
03:11:04,501 --> 03:11:07,290
consciousness.
Have you had anybody debate you on this

3870
03:11:07,291 --> 03:11:11,370
or have you had anybody oppose you?
Yeah,

3871
03:11:12,210 --> 03:11:14,220
it goes with,
it goes with the territory.

3872
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:16,980
I wish the,
uh,

3873
03:11:17,010 --> 03:11:19,620
the oppositions in some respects in some
cases.

3874
03:11:19,621 --> 03:11:22,970
I wish the opposition was a bit higher
caliber then.

3875
03:11:23,040 --> 03:11:25,010
And what I've seen,
I think it's,

3876
03:11:25,020 --> 03:11:27,950
uh,
it's been a sad state at a.

3877
03:11:28,030 --> 03:11:30,590
The most virulent opposition has not.
I have,

3878
03:11:30,600 --> 03:11:33,030
I haven't regarded as particularly I,
I quality

3879
03:11:34,080 --> 03:11:35,310
malcolm.
Michael shermer here,

3880
03:11:35,311 --> 03:11:36,144
just,
uh,

3881
03:11:36,840 --> 03:11:38,900
do you have an opinion on,
uh,

3882
03:11:38,990 --> 03:11:41,610
the,
the association of thE impact with the

3883
03:11:41,611 --> 03:11:46,611
megafauna extinction.
And also then grams hypothesis about the

3884
03:11:47,010 --> 03:11:49,110
extinction of this lost civilization.

3885
03:11:51,550 --> 03:11:52,383
The,
uh,

3886
03:11:52,780 --> 03:11:55,370
I really comment on the lost
civilization aspects of this.

3887
03:11:55,430 --> 03:11:57,180
I have a hard enough time dealing with
the media,

3888
03:11:57,181 --> 03:11:58,410
right impact,
uh,

3889
03:11:58,540 --> 03:12:01,010
as far as the megafauna goes,
I think that,

3890
03:12:01,011 --> 03:12:03,920
uh,
I guess I would say all of the above.

3891
03:12:03,950 --> 03:12:06,620
I think that all these factors came into
play.

3892
03:12:06,621 --> 03:12:10,350
You've got a humans who are,
you know,

3893
03:12:10,430 --> 03:12:12,530
for that period of technologically
advanced with,

3894
03:12:13,000 --> 03:12:13,430
with,
uh,

3895
03:12:13,430 --> 03:12:14,960
the clovis point and the,
uh,

3896
03:12:14,990 --> 03:12:17,650
the atlatl in the spear,
um,

3897
03:12:17,930 --> 03:12:22,930
the uh,
replaceable spirit tip that must have

3898
03:12:24,260 --> 03:12:26,390
been devastating to the foreigner,
but the,

3899
03:12:26,490 --> 03:12:28,220
the idea of attacking a,
a,

3900
03:12:28,490 --> 03:12:30,980
a proper sending to me is almost
unthinkable.

3901
03:12:30,981 --> 03:12:32,460
I mean,
those things are today.

3902
03:12:32,461 --> 03:12:37,360
If you don't have a high powered rifle,
I just don't see how you,

3903
03:12:37,530 --> 03:12:40,850
you realistically go up against the bull
elephant.

3904
03:12:41,300 --> 03:12:44,720
I mean,
it just strikes me as far too dangerous

3905
03:12:44,810 --> 03:12:45,643
a gone.

3906
03:12:45,860 --> 03:12:46,401
But,
uh,

3907
03:12:46,401 --> 03:12:49,400
there are aspects of that question that
I think are going to be very,

3908
03:12:49,490 --> 03:12:53,690
very interestingly the next,
the next couple of years or so,

3909
03:12:53,691 --> 03:12:56,320
we have a book coming out that addresses
that directly.

3910
03:12:56,370 --> 03:12:58,760
One of thE sites I've been researching
that,

3911
03:12:58,761 --> 03:13:01,490
uh,
the whole extinction of the megafauna

3912
03:13:01,730 --> 03:13:04,790
may have been as much related to
religion is something else.

3913
03:13:04,820 --> 03:13:08,290
There may have been a relIgion built
around the extinction of the megafauna.

3914
03:13:09,060 --> 03:13:09,891
Um,
how,

3915
03:13:09,891 --> 03:13:14,891
so that's well that
you'd want the evidence for that and

3916
03:13:15,321 --> 03:13:16,820
that,
that evidence will be coming out in a

3917
03:13:16,821 --> 03:13:19,280
book and that's going to be published in
about a month or two.

3918
03:13:19,460 --> 03:13:21,920
Oh,
I could speak to the whole idea of

3919
03:13:22,090 --> 03:13:23,900
hunting bull elephants,
though unfortunately,

3920
03:13:23,901 --> 03:13:25,970
people have been hunting with bows and
arrows forever.

3921
03:13:26,340 --> 03:13:27,890
Uh,
it's not an adult battle.

3922
03:13:27,891 --> 03:13:30,260
Atlatl is less effective.
You get less range,

3923
03:13:30,261 --> 03:13:34,850
but people hunt with not just modern
compound bows,

3924
03:13:34,851 --> 03:13:36,270
which are very powerful.
The w,

3925
03:13:36,350 --> 03:13:38,990
which would allow you to shoot it from
100 yards away.

3926
03:13:38,991 --> 03:13:43,100
But with long bows,
they've been hunting elephants with bows

3927
03:13:43,101 --> 03:13:44,860
and arrows for a long time.
You know,

3928
03:13:45,350 --> 03:13:48,680
especially the thing with wooly mammoths
was that they would go after the

3929
03:13:48,681 --> 03:13:52,130
females,
apparently according to dan flores who

3930
03:13:52,131 --> 03:13:56,690
wrote american serengeti and that the
females would keep the young in their

3931
03:13:56,691 --> 03:13:58,760
body.
Their gestation period was very long.

3932
03:13:58,761 --> 03:14:00,140
Like,
I believe you said it was two years,

3933
03:14:00,141 --> 03:14:02,870
is that correct?
I think you said it was two years and so

3934
03:14:02,871 --> 03:14:05,510
it made them extremely vulnerable when
they were pregnant.

3935
03:14:05,511 --> 03:14:07,910
Obviously if you kill off thE females
that are pregnant,

3936
03:14:07,940 --> 03:14:11,300
you're killing off a substantial part of
the breeding population and the

3937
03:14:11,301 --> 03:14:14,660
population suffers tremendously.
So that was one.

3938
03:14:14,990 --> 03:14:18,550
But it also could have been that and you
know,

3939
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:23,800
that humans I'm sure had an impact on
virtually anything that we could eat

3940
03:14:23,961 --> 03:14:27,560
when we were starving.
But whether or not we wiped them out,

3941
03:14:27,561 --> 03:14:30,530
the blitzkrieg hypothesis,
there's a lot of holes in that theory.

3942
03:14:30,531 --> 03:14:31,410
According to,
uh,

3943
03:14:31,411 --> 03:14:32,900
a lot of people that have studied at.

3944
03:14:33,830 --> 03:14:34,860
Well I think,
you know,

3945
03:14:34,900 --> 03:14:39,900
if you have an environmental impact or a
degradation of the environment that

3946
03:14:39,961 --> 03:14:44,550
might follow a significant impact,
an extraterrestrial impact,

3947
03:14:45,060 --> 03:14:47,020
so you're,
you're reducing the population was

3948
03:14:47,021 --> 03:14:49,710
stressing the population of megafauna
that way.

3949
03:14:49,711 --> 03:14:53,040
And then you've got a population of
hunters in addition to that.

3950
03:14:53,041 --> 03:14:58,041
And especially if they're for some
reason or other focused on hunting a

3951
03:14:58,400 --> 03:14:59,310
sent ends.
And when the,

3952
03:14:59,370 --> 03:15:01,650
when the number gets limited,
they don't care whether it's a female or

3953
03:15:01,651 --> 03:15:04,320
a male and they go africa wherever they
can get,

3954
03:15:04,350 --> 03:15:07,050
then I think the population of
megaphones gonna suffer.

3955
03:15:07,230 --> 03:15:09,420
So I think it's a combination of
factors,

3956
03:15:09,421 --> 03:15:10,770
not necessarily just one.

3957
03:15:10,910 --> 03:15:12,260
Yeah,
I think that's very reasonable.

3958
03:15:12,860 --> 03:15:14,150
Malcolm,
is there anything else that you would

3959
03:15:14,151 --> 03:15:15,650
like to add before we let you go?

3960
03:15:17,170 --> 03:15:17,951
Uh,
no,

3961
03:15:17,951 --> 03:15:18,784
I,
I,

3962
03:15:18,820 --> 03:15:22,900
I guess one thing is the interest.
I found it interesting in the discussion

3963
03:15:22,901 --> 03:15:23,734
of,
uh,

3964
03:15:23,860 --> 03:15:25,510
the uh,
the scab lands and,

3965
03:15:26,200 --> 03:15:27,730
and uh,
that was really,

3966
03:15:28,030 --> 03:15:32,590
it was looking at the scab lands from,
from flying over them when I was a young

3967
03:15:32,591 --> 03:15:34,510
naval officer that,
uh,

3968
03:15:34,570 --> 03:15:37,300
got me interested in science and why I
pursued science.

3969
03:15:37,301 --> 03:15:40,840
It was looking at that,
the catastrophes that were etched in the

3970
03:15:40,841 --> 03:15:42,330
landscape there,
uh,

3971
03:15:42,360 --> 03:15:47,360
the catastrophic floods that really
caused me to pursue a career in science.

3972
03:15:47,951 --> 03:15:49,030
It's really a remarkable.

3973
03:15:50,990 --> 03:15:52,710
It just a personal observation.

3974
03:15:52,910 --> 03:15:54,530
Well,
we're very,

3975
03:15:54,531 --> 03:15:56,900
very thankful for your time and we
really,

3976
03:15:56,930 --> 03:15:59,690
really appreciate your input here and it
means a lot.

3977
03:15:59,691 --> 03:16:01,250
And,
and thank you for everything you've

3978
03:16:01,251 --> 03:16:02,960
done.
Thank you for everything that you

3979
03:16:02,961 --> 03:16:07,340
continue to do to highlight this.
It is such a fascinating subject and

3980
03:16:07,341 --> 03:16:12,320
it's so amazing and without someone like
you presenting hard data in science,

3981
03:16:12,560 --> 03:16:14,240
it would definitely be lost.
So thank you.

3982
03:16:14,241 --> 03:16:16,520
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

3983
03:16:16,820 --> 03:16:17,550
Thank you,
malcolm.

3984
03:16:17,550 --> 03:16:18,770
Yeah,
thank you malcolm.

3985
03:16:19,500 --> 03:16:20,271
All right,
malcolm,

3986
03:16:20,271 --> 03:16:22,350
we're going to let you go.
Okay.

3987
03:16:23,270 --> 03:16:25,160
Take it easy buddy.
Sat down.

3988
03:16:26,810 --> 03:16:28,070
Time for your nap.
Malcolm.

3989
03:16:28,850 --> 03:16:31,310
It's a lot of energy.
So these podcasts are long.

3990
03:16:31,340 --> 03:16:33,350
I mean four hours.
The guy was sitting there on standby.

3991
03:16:33,351 --> 03:16:34,520
Probably,
you know,

3992
03:16:35,510 --> 03:16:36,860
chomping at the bit.
I'm jamie.

3993
03:16:36,861 --> 03:16:39,200
Before we go,
I want to see some pictures of the scab

3994
03:16:39,201 --> 03:16:40,820
lands because that is pretty amazing
stuff.

3995
03:16:40,820 --> 03:16:42,950
And randall,
one more thing before we go.

3996
03:16:43,550 --> 03:16:46,970
One thing that you pointed out to me
during one of the episodes that was so

3997
03:16:46,971 --> 03:16:51,971
stunning was these woolly mammoths that
had been literally knocked over by an

3998
03:16:52,940 --> 03:16:56,180
impact with broken legs and that died on
the spot.

3999
03:16:56,480 --> 03:16:58,420
Do you have those images?
I do it.

4000
03:16:58,430 --> 03:17:00,620
That was actually a mastodon mastodon.
I'm sorry.

4001
03:17:01,180 --> 03:17:02,150
Yeah,
yeah.

4002
03:17:02,240 --> 03:17:03,890
I want to see those.
So let's go to the scab.

4003
03:17:03,891 --> 03:17:07,130
Lands first so we can show the audience
on youtube,

4004
03:17:07,400 --> 03:17:11,510
which is by the way,
only about 10 percent of the people that

4005
03:17:11,511 --> 03:17:14,210
watch this,
so if you're listening to this,

4006
03:17:14,211 --> 03:17:19,211
go check out the a scab lands on a on
google and you could see this.

4007
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:22,640
Describe it to us,
randall.

4008
03:17:22,910 --> 03:17:23,930
Well here where this is

4009
03:17:24,730 --> 03:17:26,530
textbook,
scab land right here.

4010
03:17:27,820 --> 03:17:31,930
Let's see what this is.
Probably rock lake or sprague lake into

4011
03:17:31,931 --> 03:17:32,790
cheney.
Paloose.

4012
03:17:32,800 --> 03:17:35,230
Scab lands.
Yeah,

4013
03:17:35,231 --> 03:17:38,620
you see the potholes there.
That's a sign of turbulence.

4014
03:17:38,621 --> 03:17:43,621
Extreme turbulence within the water.
Coking is is what the process is called,

4015
03:17:45,011 --> 03:17:48,920
where you get it's so turbulent than it
actually produces vortexes.

4016
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:51,430
High intensity vortex motion in the
water.

4017
03:17:51,431 --> 03:17:54,910
It'll pick up sediment and it can drill
its way right into the,

4018
03:17:54,970 --> 03:17:59,970
into the bedrock I'm going down there.
That's palouse falls,

4019
03:18:00,040 --> 03:18:05,040
which was say that's an under foot
waterfall because what you have to

4020
03:18:05,111 --> 03:18:07,600
realize is that at the peak of the
flooding,

4021
03:18:07,601 --> 03:18:12,160
this entire scene was submerged below
water and the cataract here is an

4022
03:18:12,161 --> 03:18:17,161
extinct feature and the flow over here
was thousands of times greater than the

4023
03:18:17,711 --> 03:18:20,980
present palouse river that you see right
there.

4024
03:18:23,170 --> 03:18:28,170
We've got a lot of great pictures up
unto geo cosmic rex website and some

4025
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:31,350
awesome video clips.
I'm just curious,

4026
03:18:31,360 --> 03:18:35,150
are these geo cosmic rex?
Rex.

4027
03:18:35,151 --> 03:18:35,980
Rex.
Okay.

4028
03:18:35,980 --> 03:18:38,050
And you were saying wreck like a car
wreck.

4029
03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:39,940
Well that's,
it's a play on words.

4030
03:18:41,550 --> 03:18:42,850
Um,
so yeah,

4031
03:18:42,851 --> 03:18:46,210
we are talking about that,
but yeah,

4032
03:18:46,211 --> 03:18:48,160
we got some great footage on

4033
03:18:48,160 --> 03:18:48,911
there.
I did.

4034
03:18:48,911 --> 03:18:52,370
We show that last time.
I believe we did the light of deadly.

4035
03:18:52,390 --> 03:18:55,810
Showed a bit of a chemist.
Prairie ripples.

4036
03:18:55,840 --> 03:19:00,500
Did we show potholes cataract?
Yeah.

4037
03:19:02,120 --> 03:19:07,120
This whole scab land thing is his
literally fascinated me since 1978 and

4038
03:19:09,190 --> 03:19:13,060
like malcolm and I think that summer of
1970 traveling out in some of these

4039
03:19:13,061 --> 03:19:14,140
landscapes.
Where you.

4040
03:19:15,240 --> 03:19:16,210
Yeah,
here we go.

4041
03:19:17,200 --> 03:19:19,960
Is the drone footage.
Wow.

4042
03:19:22,650 --> 03:19:24,430
Yeah.
And let's see,

4043
03:19:24,431 --> 03:19:27,300
be ready to pause you if we need to
hear.

4044
03:19:28,390 --> 03:19:30,460
Is this the beginning?
Because at the beginning we have a

4045
03:19:30,461 --> 03:19:32,890
google earth image.
She can get a sense of what we're

4046
03:19:32,891 --> 03:19:34,270
looking at here.
Go,

4047
03:19:34,500 --> 03:19:37,180
go back to the beginning,
right at the very beginning.

4048
03:19:37,330 --> 03:19:39,720
Let's see if it starts off with.
Oh,

4049
03:19:39,730 --> 03:19:41,470
it starts off with the drone.
Okay.

4050
03:19:41,560 --> 03:19:45,580
There should be another one that
actually.

4051
03:19:45,730 --> 03:19:47,080
That's okay.
This is pretty cool.

4052
03:19:47,110 --> 03:19:47,943
Yeah.
This is.

4053
03:19:48,400 --> 03:19:50,470
This is.
These are 400 foot cliffs.

4054
03:19:50,500 --> 03:19:54,520
This was a bomb recessional cataract.
Very similar to dry falls.

4055
03:19:55,030 --> 03:19:59,380
The water was pouring.
Coming from behind our view here.

4056
03:19:59,440 --> 03:20:02,050
Where's this specifically?
If anybody wanted to go watch this or

4057
03:20:02,051 --> 03:20:03,760
look at this area.
Oh,

4058
03:20:03,761 --> 03:20:06,190
the actual area.
This is an eastern Washington

4059
03:20:07,720 --> 03:20:10,510
eastern rim of quinty base and it's
called.

4060
03:20:10,511 --> 03:20:14,380
It's right along.
Just if you can see up there were those

4061
03:20:14,381 --> 03:20:18,220
cliffs are in the middle distance,
right below there is the columbia river.

4062
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:21,640
And this is just north of wenatchee,
Wisconsin,

4063
03:20:22,090 --> 03:20:23,290
Wisconsin,
Washington.

4064
03:20:24,520 --> 03:20:29,520
So basically what we had here was
plucking a quarrying as the water poured

4065
03:20:29,711 --> 03:20:32,620
over this ridge.
This is the babcock ridge and behind us

4066
03:20:32,621 --> 03:20:35,470
as the quincy basin,
which served as a temporary holding

4067
03:20:35,471 --> 03:20:38,320
pond.
And let's see,

4068
03:20:38,321 --> 03:20:39,550
is the,
is the

4069
03:20:41,350 --> 03:20:44,480
drone comes around?
I'm looking for the um,

4070
03:20:45,910 --> 03:20:47,640
for the team.
Oh,

4071
03:20:48,970 --> 03:20:51,550
keep going to zoom in a little bit more
there.

4072
03:20:51,551 --> 03:20:53,950
Jamie.
she can see you guys down there on the

4073
03:20:53,951 --> 03:20:54,700
ground,
right?

4074
03:20:54,700 --> 03:20:56,080
Yeah.
Were they in there somewhere?

4075
03:20:56,081 --> 03:20:57,640
Lost in the vastness of the.

4076
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:01,000
Yeah.
Now I remember we did show this.

4077
03:21:01,150 --> 03:21:03,240
Yeah.
What about those images of the

4078
03:21:03,310 --> 03:21:05,470
mastodons?
Let's look at tHose and then let's get

4079
03:21:05,471 --> 03:21:06,500
outta here.
Okay.

4080
03:21:07,180 --> 03:21:10,150
For that,
you have to go to the world of the

4081
03:21:10,270 --> 03:21:14,440
pleistocene,
which I just should have given you.

4082
03:21:14,500 --> 03:21:16,990
That sounds like a amusement park.
Yeah.

4083
03:21:17,380 --> 03:21:21,280
The world of the place is,
be some dudes with animal skins on them.

4084
03:21:21,281 --> 03:21:22,930
Well,
maybe if they stayed in,

4085
03:21:23,210 --> 03:21:27,100
you know,
cloning some of those frozen animals up

4086
03:21:27,110 --> 03:21:30,150
there.
Yeah.

4087
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:33,700
I don't know how plausible it is,
but that seems like a terrible idea.

4088
03:21:34,240 --> 03:21:38,350
The last world,
nothing is any diseases.

4089
03:21:38,490 --> 03:21:40,480
Well that's one of the big concerns
about climate change,

4090
03:21:40,481 --> 03:21:41,710
right?
They we're going to release some

4091
03:21:42,430 --> 03:21:44,440
diseases that we don't have an immune
system for.

4092
03:21:44,470 --> 03:21:46,310
Yep.
Go to slide

4093
03:21:46,310 --> 03:21:47,330
78.

4094
03:21:49,580 --> 03:21:51,500
This is a good example of,
by the way,

4095
03:21:51,501 --> 03:21:56,501
who is more thoroughly documented than
randall carlson and jesus christ.

4096
03:21:56,721 --> 03:22:01,721
Man,
go to slide 6,220 to 50 plus years of

4097
03:22:01,971 --> 03:22:04,400
walking the walk in the channels
kavalans.

4098
03:22:04,690 --> 03:22:05,121
Uh,
yeah.

4099
03:22:05,121 --> 03:22:06,680
This,
this is a bone deposit.

4100
03:22:06,740 --> 03:22:08,960
Um,
and what happens is that in a

4101
03:22:08,961 --> 03:22:10,820
particularly warm years,
when the,

4102
03:22:10,821 --> 03:22:13,580
um,
the permafrost around thE rivers

4103
03:22:13,581 --> 03:22:17,210
collapses,
it exposes these huge deposits of bones

4104
03:22:17,211 --> 03:22:21,350
which had been buried in the permafrost.
This is,

4105
03:22:21,860 --> 03:22:24,890
when I look at stuff like this,
this is why I say there had to be

4106
03:22:24,891 --> 03:22:29,780
another mechanisms of extinction besides
human hunting because this pile,

4107
03:22:30,470 --> 03:22:32,060
yeah,
because it possible that this,

4108
03:22:32,061 --> 03:22:34,220
I mean,
it's not necessarily at the bottom of a

4109
03:22:34,221 --> 03:22:34,791
cliff,
right?

4110
03:22:34,791 --> 03:22:38,470
Because you know that they pushed a lot
of them off cliffs and know this.

4111
03:22:38,480 --> 03:22:41,210
THis is stuff that when the river
floods,

4112
03:22:41,240 --> 03:22:44,710
it erodes the banks and then this stuff
falls out of the riverbanks.

4113
03:22:45,340 --> 03:22:48,110
So it's,
it's been locked into the permafrost for

4114
03:22:48,200 --> 03:22:52,220
however many thousands of years and it
seems like there's interestingly two

4115
03:22:52,430 --> 03:22:57,430
peaks of dates that one right around
13,000 and the other one around $36,000

4116
03:22:58,950 --> 03:22:59,870
that,
that the,

4117
03:23:00,760 --> 03:23:03,170
that the,
that the fossilized remains are dating

4118
03:23:03,171 --> 03:23:05,480
too,
which could point to a potentially that

4119
03:23:05,481 --> 03:23:08,540
there was some sort of an impact back
then as well or something else,

4120
03:23:08,541 --> 03:23:09,910
some sort of event.
I,

4121
03:23:09,911 --> 03:23:12,530
I don'T know.
I don't have an opinion on now by having

4122
03:23:12,531 --> 03:23:15,800
all these together.
I mean has it been theorize that perhaps

4123
03:23:15,801 --> 03:23:18,110
this was at the.
This is not all your cliff near this,

4124
03:23:18,111 --> 03:23:19,100
right?
Yeah.

4125
03:23:19,101 --> 03:23:20,720
Just off the,
to the right,

4126
03:23:20,830 --> 03:23:23,000
to their interest.
There is a cliff where at the bottom of

4127
03:23:23,001 --> 03:23:24,860
a cliff right here.
That is actually,

4128
03:23:24,861 --> 03:23:26,640
it's a riverbank.
So,

4129
03:23:26,840 --> 03:23:29,180
so just off,
you know that that was a hunting method.

4130
03:23:29,200 --> 03:23:32,240
They used to storm them off the side of
cliffs and they never,

4131
03:23:32,370 --> 03:23:35,640
they literally couldn't even eat all of
them like head smashed in buffalo heads

4132
03:23:35,641 --> 03:23:35,950
smashed.

4133
03:23:35,950 --> 03:23:38,150
They would do,
they would run so many them off cliffs

4134
03:23:38,170 --> 03:23:39,410
that.
But here's the thing,

4135
03:23:39,770 --> 03:23:41,180
here's the thing,
when you look at at,

4136
03:23:41,270 --> 03:23:45,080
at the more these mortality events of
modern animals,

4137
03:23:45,081 --> 03:23:48,080
even like looking at elephants that
perished during some of the severe

4138
03:23:48,081 --> 03:23:53,000
droughts in the eighties in africa,
taxonomic studies show that it doesn't

4139
03:23:53,001 --> 03:23:53,870
take three,
four,

4140
03:23:53,871 --> 03:23:58,790
five years before the remains have
completely disappeared.

4141
03:24:00,170 --> 03:24:03,680
In order to preserve a fossil,
it has to be rapidly removed from any

4142
03:24:03,681 --> 03:24:08,150
kind of forces,
oxidation or scavenger or anything that

4143
03:24:08,151 --> 03:24:09,230
would consume it.
See,

4144
03:24:09,710 --> 03:24:11,030
this stuff has been,
again,

4145
03:24:11,031 --> 03:24:14,840
it's been frozen in the permafrost for,
for however many years,

4146
03:24:14,841 --> 03:24:19,340
10 or 12 or 15,000 years.
So it was likely covered in an event.

4147
03:24:19,430 --> 03:24:20,900
Covered in an event.
Yes.

4148
03:24:21,020 --> 03:24:22,910
Now what?
There was one that I really wanteD you

4149
03:24:22,911 --> 03:24:27,500
to get to that was a mastodon that had
been literally knocked over and had

4150
03:24:27,501 --> 03:24:28,910
broken legs.
Yeah.

4151
03:24:28,970 --> 03:24:29,870
That would be.

4152
03:24:32,610 --> 03:24:37,610
We could look very quickly at slide 92.
This is one of the more interesting

4153
03:24:39,390 --> 03:24:41,070
anomalous events.
This was the,

4154
03:24:41,071 --> 03:24:44,280
um,
the flash woolly mammoth.

4155
03:24:46,260 --> 03:24:47,790
Go to the,
go to slide 93.

4156
03:24:47,791 --> 03:24:49,680
It's a much clearer.
Yeah.

4157
03:24:49,681 --> 03:24:52,440
This was a mammoth.
SIx ton mammoth.

4158
03:24:52,441 --> 03:24:55,080
That was again,
one of these river collapses.

4159
03:24:55,140 --> 03:25:00,140
the banks collapsed during a warm spring
and expose this remains of a woolly

4160
03:25:01,351 --> 03:25:04,740
mammoth with soft tissue preserved,
uh,

4161
03:25:05,250 --> 03:25:09,180
contents of the food in its stomach on
digested actually a mouthful of food.

4162
03:25:10,140 --> 03:25:14,040
The hips of the mammoth where we're both
broken as if he was thrown back on his

4163
03:25:14,041 --> 03:25:18,180
haunches very violently.
He had an erect penis,

4164
03:25:18,181 --> 03:25:21,870
which suggests to us that he was
suffocated,

4165
03:25:22,080 --> 03:25:24,640
which he was a freak where he was
freaked out.

4166
03:25:24,730 --> 03:25:27,840
He was getting.
Michael laughed at that.

4167
03:25:27,850 --> 03:25:32,280
That's
the wolves ate the flesh off the skull.

4168
03:25:32,281 --> 03:25:36,100
That's why it's buried like that.
You'll see the front left for liam

4169
03:25:36,240 --> 03:25:39,090
there.
You'll see the bottom there left right

4170
03:25:39,091 --> 03:25:41,310
at the center of the screen.
That's his back leg.

4171
03:25:41,680 --> 03:25:43,170
Oh wow.
Did you see right there?

4172
03:25:44,460 --> 03:25:47,100
The interesting thing about this is you
know,

4173
03:25:47,130 --> 03:25:47,530
the,
the,

4174
03:25:47,530 --> 03:25:51,900
the rapidity of climate change that's
implied by being able to freeze a six

4175
03:25:51,901 --> 03:25:54,480
ton mammoth because the contents of his
stomach,

4176
03:25:54,481 --> 03:25:57,330
according to the studies had not really
been purified yet,

4177
03:25:57,360 --> 03:26:01,440
which implies that the entire carcass
had been frozen through and through

4178
03:26:01,950 --> 03:26:04,020
probably in less than 10 hours.

4179
03:26:05,020 --> 03:26:06,430
Well,
like it see the ice man,

4180
03:26:06,490 --> 03:26:08,220
that's,
that's what happened to him.

4181
03:26:08,240 --> 03:26:09,980
That's exactly what happened to him.
Yes.

4182
03:26:10,550 --> 03:26:11,890
Interesting point.
In abu dhabi,

4183
03:26:11,891 --> 03:26:15,980
a subject that we should talk about,
it fell in between a crevice in a

4184
03:26:15,981 --> 03:26:16,910
glacier,
correct?

4185
03:26:16,911 --> 03:26:19,460
Yeah,
and probably got rapidly buried under

4186
03:26:19,461 --> 03:26:22,570
the under the snow and the ice and
that's how he ended up overnight

4187
03:26:22,640 --> 03:26:23,340
preserved.
Yeah,

4188
03:26:23,340 --> 03:26:24,560
overnIght.
Exactly.

4189
03:26:24,950 --> 03:26:27,740
The next slide actually shows her
reconstruction of the,

4190
03:26:27,870 --> 03:26:30,210
of the in,
in a,

4191
03:26:31,040 --> 03:26:35,270
in a museum in Russia,
showing what the mammoth,

4192
03:26:35,510 --> 03:26:37,460
the circumstances under which he was
found.

4193
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:39,710
If you go to

4194
03:26:40,500 --> 03:26:45,180
as a sidebar on annuity ad to show you
how science changes rather slowly.

4195
03:26:45,181 --> 03:26:48,870
Sometimes it was a decade before they
found out he was murdered because they

4196
03:26:48,871 --> 03:26:53,871
found arrow point in his scapula.
Here they can cut is about annie had a

4197
03:26:54,080 --> 03:26:57,420
defensive wounds on his hands and arms,
so he'd gotten into a fight and he had

4198
03:26:57,421 --> 03:27:02,250
other people's blood on his hands,
so he gave as good as he got and lost a

4199
03:27:02,251 --> 03:27:03,360
fight.
So he was murdered.

4200
03:27:03,510 --> 03:27:05,000
Wow.
And that,

4201
03:27:05,040 --> 03:27:08,760
that took it with all that careful
observation and laboratories that 10

4202
03:27:08,761 --> 03:27:13,761
years before that came out.
Sometimes this stuff has to just take a

4203
03:27:14,381 --> 03:27:16,740
while.
So if I can try to find some common

4204
03:27:16,741 --> 03:27:18,800
ground with before we sign off with
graeme,

4205
03:27:19,400 --> 03:27:20,490
um,
you know,

4206
03:27:20,491 --> 03:27:22,350
you're uh,
you know,

4207
03:27:22,460 --> 03:27:24,600
your book is,
you have this really great sentence that

4208
03:27:24,601 --> 03:27:27,510
I quote this,
it would mean at least that some yet

4209
03:27:27,511 --> 03:27:30,990
unknown and identify people somewhere in
the world had already mastered all the

4210
03:27:30,991 --> 03:27:34,500
arts and attributes of a high
civilization more than 12,000 years ago

4211
03:27:34,860 --> 03:27:36,570
and sent out emissaries around the
world.

4212
03:27:36,571 --> 03:27:38,760
Okay.
I think this is entirely possible

4213
03:27:38,761 --> 03:27:42,010
cognitively for sure.
And

4214
03:27:42,220 --> 03:27:45,610
it Will do it for me.
What the boats that they sent the

4215
03:27:45,611 --> 03:27:50,611
emissaries out on the wood,
carbon 14 dated in some specific

4216
03:27:50,621 --> 03:27:54,370
examples of high arts and attributes of
high civilization.

4217
03:27:54,690 --> 03:27:57,700
So if it's not metal and writing,
then you know,

4218
03:27:57,701 --> 03:27:59,920
whatever it is,
I would change my mind.

4219
03:28:00,780 --> 03:28:03,810
That's good to hear michael.
And I think as the,

4220
03:28:04,170 --> 03:28:07,860
as the research continues in this area
for the last few years,

4221
03:28:09,390 --> 03:28:14,390
having been very much an outsider,
I have felt that the evidence is moving

4222
03:28:14,851 --> 03:28:18,090
in a direction that is helpful to the
argument that I make.

4223
03:28:18,120 --> 03:28:20,790
I hope it'll continue to be that way.
I hope the evidence that you're looking

4224
03:28:20,791 --> 03:28:21,571
for will,
will,

4225
03:28:21,571 --> 03:28:24,030
will come out.
And I'm trying to,

4226
03:28:24,570 --> 03:28:25,920
like I say my,
my,

4227
03:28:25,950 --> 03:28:30,300
my role is a reporter and I'm trying to
be a reporter for the alternative sides

4228
03:28:30,301 --> 03:28:33,090
of things.
But to do so to do so in an effective.

4229
03:28:33,160 --> 03:28:34,230
And hopefully

4230
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:37,590
there's a good argument in the history
of science to be made for the role of

4231
03:28:37,591 --> 03:28:41,820
outsiders and mean complete outsiders to
come in and shake things up.

4232
03:28:41,821 --> 03:28:43,630
I mean freeman dyson as an example,
you know?

4233
03:28:43,670 --> 03:28:44,670
Yeah,
totally.

4234
03:28:44,671 --> 03:28:47,220
Self taught autodidact.
I called you an autodidact.

4235
03:28:47,250 --> 03:28:49,350
Absolutely.
And they can make.

4236
03:28:49,380 --> 03:28:53,700
And if nothing else,
they push people to really figure out

4237
03:28:53,701 --> 03:28:55,350
what it is they believe in.
Why?

4238
03:28:55,440 --> 03:28:57,120
Because otherwise no one's going to
challenge them.

4239
03:28:57,140 --> 03:28:59,880
So in births is a good example of that.
You know,

4240
03:29:00,050 --> 03:29:01,450
a high school teacher,
right?

4241
03:29:01,910 --> 03:29:04,110
However,
randall carlson is good example.

4242
03:29:06,840 --> 03:29:07,260
Well,
let's see.

4243
03:29:07,260 --> 03:29:08,700
You still want to look at this real
quick.

4244
03:29:08,701 --> 03:29:10,800
The mastodon I got right here.
Let's do it.

4245
03:29:11,190 --> 03:29:15,210
He could go for days about randall.
He never gets tired of this stuff.

4246
03:29:15,910 --> 03:29:18,510
If you could bottle your enthusiasm will
be an awesome pill.

4247
03:29:19,340 --> 03:29:24,000
Well,
maybe we can talk about the memory.

4248
03:29:24,001 --> 03:29:26,370
Focus there all.
Alright,

4249
03:29:26,371 --> 03:29:27,031
we're gonna.
We're gonna.

4250
03:29:27,031 --> 03:29:29,010
Look at this.
This mastered on here.

4251
03:29:29,760 --> 03:29:31,530
One 25.
One 25.

4252
03:29:31,531 --> 03:29:34,280
Yeah.
So this is a mastodon that was dug up in

4253
03:29:34,281 --> 03:29:35,970
a pit years ago.
Um,

4254
03:29:36,750 --> 03:29:40,500
excavation showed that the bones were
lying on an inner layer of limey clay or

4255
03:29:40,501 --> 03:29:42,390
marble,
about one foot and thickness,

4256
03:29:42,920 --> 03:29:45,480
um,
when the,

4257
03:29:45,840 --> 03:29:49,110
when it gets up there and it goes on to
say the skeleton proved to be badly

4258
03:29:49,111 --> 03:29:51,240
disturbed and the bones crushed and
broken.

4259
03:29:51,570 --> 03:29:53,760
As an example of the amount of
disturbance,

4260
03:29:53,790 --> 03:29:56,100
one of the ribs lay beneath one of the
tusks.

4261
03:29:56,670 --> 03:29:59,820
While another was thrust through an
aperture in the pelvis,

4262
03:30:00,120 --> 03:30:03,540
a shoulder blade rested to the right of
the skull and one of the large neck

4263
03:30:03,541 --> 03:30:07,830
vertebrae was found about 10 feet from
the skull near a portion of the pelvis

4264
03:30:08,160 --> 03:30:11,170
in spite of the wide dislocation of the
parts the.

4265
03:30:11,340 --> 03:30:13,020
Now this is where it really is
interesting.

4266
03:30:13,050 --> 03:30:18,050
The bones of one of the feet remained
intact and in place very possibly in the

4267
03:30:18,151 --> 03:30:21,120
spot where the animal last step.
So in other words,

4268
03:30:22,320 --> 03:30:24,990
the foot,
there was a foot still embedded in the

4269
03:30:24,991 --> 03:30:28,380
soft material where he was apparently
stepping at the time,

4270
03:30:29,250 --> 03:30:30,930
whatever happened to them.
Um,

4271
03:30:31,530 --> 03:30:33,720
and this is all the same time period as
the other mastodon.

4272
03:30:33,750 --> 03:30:36,150
We don't have data on this,
but it,

4273
03:30:36,170 --> 03:30:41,150
it likely was at the very end,
probably right in that younger dryas

4274
03:30:41,151 --> 03:30:43,940
window because of the amount of sediment
over it goes to the next slide,

4275
03:30:43,941 --> 03:30:44,330
jamie.

4276
03:30:44,330 --> 03:30:47,010
And we'll see 1:26.
We can get a better than this thing

4277
03:30:47,540 --> 03:30:49,850
theoretically,
at least was blown back.

4278
03:30:50,800 --> 03:30:53,180
Yeah,
go to.

4279
03:30:53,420 --> 03:30:57,290
There we go there you can see one of the
femurs that's been busted squarely

4280
03:30:57,291 --> 03:30:59,040
across.
Um,

4281
03:31:00,050 --> 03:31:04,220
they go on to say that even the largest
of the bone such as the thigh bones were

4282
03:31:04,221 --> 03:31:08,960
broken squarely across in places
indicating that some considerable force

4283
03:31:09,230 --> 03:31:13,520
had been exerted upon them.
Any conclusion as to an agency powerful

4284
03:31:13,521 --> 03:31:17,150
enough to cause such destruction must be
highly speculative.

4285
03:31:17,990 --> 03:31:22,990
So basically what you're seeing here is
a mastodon that got smashed into the

4286
03:31:24,050 --> 03:31:24,980
ground.
Wow.

4287
03:31:25,210 --> 03:31:27,470
The forest is,
there were strong,

4288
03:31:27,471 --> 03:31:31,490
powerful sheer forces that would have
literally separated his leg from the

4289
03:31:31,491 --> 03:31:34,640
foot.
It still in immersed into the,

4290
03:31:34,730 --> 03:31:36,920
into the ground.
So I mean,

4291
03:31:36,921 --> 03:31:40,970
there are many examples of this.
The last slide we're going to show,

4292
03:31:41,570 --> 03:31:45,890
if you go back this,
I promise to digging with jack horner,

4293
03:31:45,891 --> 03:31:48,340
that paleontologists,
that dinosaur digger and he,

4294
03:31:48,341 --> 03:31:53,341
he showed these debris flow pileups of
dinosaur bones that had been splintered

4295
03:31:55,001 --> 03:31:56,090
and broken.
Wow.

4296
03:31:56,210 --> 03:32:00,900
And these are huge just from the force
of the water and then piling up at the

4297
03:32:00,901 --> 03:32:04,910
edge of a wall and sl if you can do it
to a dinosaur.

4298
03:32:05,240 --> 03:32:07,520
Wow.
Eighty 85

4299
03:32:09,500 --> 03:32:14,500
85 is an interesting slide because what
it shows is the london ivory docs,

4300
03:32:15,050 --> 03:32:17,180
which over a period of about two
centuries,

4301
03:32:17,840 --> 03:32:22,190
this was.
This was a mammoth ivory that's being

4302
03:32:22,191 --> 03:32:25,490
dug out of the siberian permafrost.
That's just a drawing.

4303
03:32:25,700 --> 03:32:26,750
Oh,
that's just a drawing.

4304
03:32:29,200 --> 03:32:31,910
That's the problem with that.
Like that's what it looked like.

4305
03:32:34,920 --> 03:32:38,810
A 19th century scene showing the ivory
floor of the london docks covered by

4306
03:32:38,811 --> 03:32:43,550
thousands of mammoth tusks and this went
on year after year after year after year

4307
03:32:43,551 --> 03:32:47,420
for roughly two centuries.
There is so much of that mammoth ivory,

4308
03:32:47,421 --> 03:32:49,760
by the way that they use it to make
knife handles.

4309
03:32:49,761 --> 03:32:52,540
I actually have a knife handle that I.
Yeah,

4310
03:32:52,541 --> 03:32:55,940
that was made out of mammoth ivory and
still to this day,

4311
03:32:55,941 --> 03:33:00,260
not only is it legal,
but it's common to use mammoth ivory for

4312
03:33:00,350 --> 03:33:02,270
different kinds of things and there's so
much of it.

4313
03:33:02,300 --> 03:33:03,890
Well,
they're not endangered species because

4314
03:33:03,891 --> 03:33:07,610
there was kind of a loophole in this
case though.

4315
03:33:07,611 --> 03:33:11,390
What we have is tucks that are being
again dug out of the permafrost.

4316
03:33:12,260 --> 03:33:15,020
So how did they get there?
That becomes the questIon,

4317
03:33:15,470 --> 03:33:18,770
does it have anything to do with human
predation or was it a natural

4318
03:33:18,771 --> 03:33:23,630
catastrophe that somehow ended up
putting all these mammas down and

4319
03:33:23,631 --> 03:33:25,130
burying them into permafrost?

4320
03:33:25,460 --> 03:33:27,890
That's the question I want to raise.
Well,

4321
03:33:27,891 --> 03:33:31,880
I think we raised a lot of questions.
I think we got some pretty good answers.

4322
03:33:31,881 --> 03:33:34,910
I think We had some great dialogue and I
really appreciate your time.

4323
03:33:34,911 --> 03:33:39,270
All three of you guys and thank you to
malcolm and thank you mark and thank you

4324
03:33:39,271 --> 03:33:40,170
to young jamie.
Oh,

4325
03:33:40,171 --> 03:33:41,720
thanks for hosting.
My pleasure.

4326
03:33:42,200 --> 03:33:45,450
Treat.
can I do a quick shout out out?

4327
03:33:45,480 --> 03:33:47,670
I want to thank brad young,
cameron,

4328
03:33:47,671 --> 03:33:49,590
wiltshire,
my brother,

4329
03:33:49,600 --> 03:33:52,410
rowan,
my wife julie for helping make this

4330
03:33:52,411 --> 03:33:55,920
possible.
I also want to have people go to the geo

4331
03:33:55,921 --> 03:34:00,120
cosmic rick's website and the sacred
geometry international website for a lot

4332
03:34:00,121 --> 03:34:04,650
more of this kind of stuff.
Then I'm going to thank my beloved

4333
03:34:04,651 --> 03:34:07,740
partner and wife santha,
who's chaired every adventure with me

4334
03:34:07,741 --> 03:34:10,290
for the last quarter of a century.
We climbed the great pyramid together.

4335
03:34:10,300 --> 03:34:13,830
We'd been at the bottom of the ocean
together and I wouldn't be doing any of

4336
03:34:13,831 --> 03:34:16,320
this stuff if it weren't for that
wonderful woman behind me.

4337
03:34:16,890 --> 03:34:18,060
Michael shermer,
who you want to thank.

4338
03:34:18,090 --> 03:34:19,530
Oh,
thank my wife jennifer,

4339
03:34:19,531 --> 03:34:21,030
my little boy vinny.
And uh,

4340
03:34:21,150 --> 03:34:21,983
my agent,
my.

4341
03:34:22,060 --> 03:34:24,670
No,
no,

4342
03:34:24,690 --> 03:34:26,130
no,
but a skeptic.com.

4343
03:34:26,131 --> 03:34:28,980
And my partner pat,
who keeps the show running when I'm

4344
03:34:28,981 --> 03:34:30,860
running around doing things like this.
All right.

4345
03:34:30,940 --> 03:34:33,910
And joe rogan.
Joe.

4346
03:34:34,800 --> 03:34:39,090
I speak all over the world and whether
it's South Africa or whether it's Japan

4347
03:34:39,091 --> 03:34:42,540
or whether it's britain or whether it's
United States or whether it's Croatia.

4348
03:34:42,900 --> 03:34:45,260
People come up to me and they say,
Joe Robinson.

4349
03:34:45,500 --> 03:34:46,710
Yeah.
Well thank you.

4350
03:34:46,760 --> 03:34:48,870
I appreciate it.
I appreciate everybody's interesting

4351
03:34:48,871 --> 03:34:50,610
guests really.
Well.

4352
03:34:50,611 --> 03:34:52,260
You're one of them.
Do all you guys are.

4353
03:34:52,320 --> 03:34:53,400
Thank you so much.
All right.

4354
03:34:53,610 --> 03:34:54,750
We'll see you guys soon.
Thank you

4355
03:34:55,070 --> 03:34:55,520
so long.
