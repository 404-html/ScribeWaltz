1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,830
On ustream and that should be it.
I'm a fucking technology monkey.

2
00:00:11,191 --> 00:00:14,010
Sun Low.
Let's see.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,050
Second that'll go.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,760
welcome to a.
What week is it?

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,070
I don't know.
Fucking one of the uh,

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,130
ustream podcast and the itunes podcast,
which has taken over and popularity far 

7
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:33,701
more popular on the itunes than the 
Ustream for all those fine folks out 

8
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:38,591
there listening on your way to work or 
when you're supposed to be doing work or

9
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,120
when you're supposed to do on homework 
or whatever the fuck you doing.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,200
Thank you very much for tuning in.
This show is now officially sponsored by

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,390
fleshlight.
I don't know if you knew about that,

12
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:50,330
Tommy.
I'm here with my Buddy Tommy Segora,

13
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,900
Aka Tommy.
Tommy is here because,

14
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:54,500
uh,
his,

15
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:54,920
uh,
well,

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,110
first of all he's here because he's 
hilarious.

17
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:01,100
Standup comedian and a good buddy of 
mine and because his CD comes out today,

18
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:03,650
he's got a new CD called thrilled you 
got to where I do,

19
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:05,460
I do with folks.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,560
That's Tommy.
It looks like Michael Jackson,

21
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,050
but it's Tommy.
Yeah,

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,700
it's me.
Yes.

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,770
Very funny.
Tommy and I met when I was doing the,

24
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:20,771
uh,
I was doing this tour for a maximum and 

25
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,351
Bud light and uh,
me and Charlie Murphy and John Have 

26
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:24,590
Heffron and we would travel across the 
country.

27
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:26,930
We did like 20 different stops and we,
uh,

28
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:32,350
we use local guys like every,
every place we went to we had a local 

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,850
comic would go up and perform and Tommy 
was the funniest of all of them.

30
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,620
He,
he was really,

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,920
I was really shocked.
Like every now and then you see a 

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:41,920
comedian,
it's uncomfortable.

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,700
So that's why you right here.
But every now and then you see a 

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:45,700
comedian,
you know and you're like,

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,580
oh,
I didn't even know this guy was around.

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
How's he fucking so funny.
You know,

37
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:50,090
most of the time,
like when someone's funny,

38
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,410
like,
you know,

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,260
you know who they are,
you know what I'm saying here about them

40
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:54,530
already.

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,410
Yeah.
Oh totally.

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,400
Yeah.
I appreciate it.

43
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,470
You hear that Echo.
That's my other computer in the 

44
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:01,470
background.
But um,

45
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,360
yeah,
no,

46
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:02,730
I,
I,

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,010
when you travel and you see people and 
you're like,

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,270
hey,
where do you go up?

49
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,370
Because I've never seen you,
especially like when they live with,

50
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,380
but it's so rare when they're funny.
That's the thing.

51
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,640
It's like,
you know,

52
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,990
like most comics,
like if you say like comics that you 

53
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:18,790
don't know what percentage of them 
aren't,

54
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,630
don't make you laugh.

55
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,770
Percentage of companies don't make me 
laugh.

56
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,020
Oh well.
Up into like the 85th percentile.

57
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,870
It's a weird thing and I understand that
comedy is different and there's,

58
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,900
there's some things that some people 
like that I don't like or I liked that 

59
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:32,900
some people don't like.
You know,

60
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,350
there's a lot of infant tile,
ridiculous,

61
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:39,351
silly comedy.
He can't turn up the microphone all the 

62
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:40,590
way to.
I think it's on as loud as it can go.

63
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,970
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold on a second.

64
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,780
Maybe there's some sort of an input.
Is it really that low?

65
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,020
Is that any better?

66
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,970
I know I need to project

67
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,480
this.
I hope we're not.

68
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,150
We're not in some weird thing here.
It's on the blue snowball,

69
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:58,390
right?

70
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,610
Yes,
it's working.

71
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,220
Sorry.
Is it really that low?

72
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:10,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
turn the microphone up a bit.

73
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,930
I don't think I can.
I don't think there's anything I can do 

74
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,610
other than where it's at right now.
Some people say it sounds fine.

75
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,890
Some people says it's pretty quiet.
Well,

76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,370
do you have a volume on your 
motherfucking phone or whatever?

77
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,740
You're watching this on [inaudible] 
work.

78
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:26,610
That shit.
Yo,

79
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,380
what happened?
We have a little issue here.

80
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,370
Little technological issue.
Lost the screen.

81
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,950
Yeah.
On with the show.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,660
Indeed.
As this man said,

83
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,190
we were just too far.
All right.

84
00:03:46,191 --> 00:03:48,080
Well we're right up to it right now 
anyway.

85
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,880
Um,
the percentage of comics at suck,

86
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,590
I would have to say it's probably like 
80.

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,160
It's probably like 80.
Even that's just counting for district.

88
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,080
There's a lot of people that I know are 
good.

89
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,140
They're just not my style.
I totally accept that and appreciate 

90
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,530
that.
But like when you go on the road and you

91
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:08,531
see someone and you know,
you never heard about this guy before 

92
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:08,531
and you see them and they're hilarious.
You're like,

93
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:09,770
Whoa,
how fun is that?

94
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,870
It's fucking awesome.

95
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,990
It's the best thing.
Yeah.

96
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:16,190
Because even like sometimes you'll kind 
of like enjoy somebody.

97
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,290
You can go like,
uh Oh,

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,220
that was a well written joke.
That's good joke structure or something.

99
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,340
But like when you actually turn up,
like laughing,

100
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,880
like you're grabbing your gut and you're
just,

101
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,880
that's hilarious.
That's fun.

102
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,130
It's like you just found a gift,
you know,

103
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,070
it's because it's like,
especially as Comedians,

104
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:37,430
like you see everything comment or you 
see a lot of things come in rather.

105
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,070
And like when you run into someone who's
really funny,

106
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:45,071
like it's like,
oh here's another one that were out 

107
00:04:45,071 --> 00:04:47,981
there.
I know they're out there because you'll 

108
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:50,171
see so many guys that fucking suck and 
what they're talking about is just 

109
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,550
nonsense and it's just stupidity and you
know,

110
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,040
they're not even really thinking about 
what they're saying.

111
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:58,430
It's not anything that they've really 
liked come to some weird conclusion.

112
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:03,431
It's just a bunch of nonsense designed 
to make you laugh and that shit is hard 

113
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,310
to deal with over and over and over 
again.

114
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:09,311
It makes you lose faith in it.
And you wonder like for comics like 

115
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:09,560
shit,
like what is it?

116
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:10,150
Like,
like,

117
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,080
you know,
coming up [inaudible] this day,

118
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:13,370
you know,
but when I was coming up it was,

119
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,400
there was a lot more comedy clubs,
a lot more different comedians to like 

120
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,500
to look at it.
There was a lot of shit going on,

121
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:23,501
a lot of action.
It seems like there's way less action 

122
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:23,501
now.
Oh definitely.

123
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:27,221
Ms Dot way less good guys coming up or 
people coming up in general just seems 

124
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:27,860
to be a smaller community.

125
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,850
I think so,
yeah.

126
00:05:28,851 --> 00:05:30,170
I mean nationwide,
right?

127
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,920
I think so,
yeah.

128
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:35,921
There's like,
there's like a few places that are 

129
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:35,921
really like when you go to you're like,
oh,

130
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,130
this place has a good like comedy 
community.

131
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,300
Like within it,
you know,

132
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:43,580
like I kind of felt that way and like 
Austin,

133
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I was like,
they're really trying to like develop 

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,270
comics here,
but I don't really feel that way in most

135
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,730
places.
Most places it's just like a,

136
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,120
I don't know,
it's like,

137
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,540
it's like,
uh,

138
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,750
like the mall or you know,
it's

139
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,820
fucking hard to do.
It seems a lot easier than it really is.

140
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,340
It's like once you get good at it,
it kind of becomes easy.

141
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,270
You're just kinda like,
you know,

142
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,690
you know,
you understand what,

143
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,100
what it takes to write a joke and it's,
it's just a matter of putting in the 

144
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,100
time,
putting the effort.

145
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,640
But to get to a point where you're 
actually funny is it's such a long 

146
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,880
fucking process.
Like people don't realize.

147
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,400
I see a guy like,
you know,

148
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,630
anybody.
Joey Diaz.

149
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,840
Joey Diaz is a great example because 
Joey Diaz is fucking hilarious.

150
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,990
But when I met Joey Diaz,
Joey Diaz is not funny and that sounds 

151
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,461
crazy because he's one of the funniest 
people I've ever met in my life and he 

152
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:37,451
would say funny shit offstage,
but he could never be that funny on 

153
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:41,241
stage and he could never make it happen.
And somewhere along the line he just 

154
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,800
figured it out.
He figured out how to be himself,

155
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,530
who he is like in the parking lot at the
comedy store.

156
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,170
They figured out how to be that guy on 
stage and all of a sudden Bam.

157
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,250
It was just,
he nailed it,

158
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,660
knocked it out of the park.
But that's like the heart

159
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,350
seem to do,
right?

160
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,040
I mean that's,
that's super hard.

161
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,470
Like [inaudible] I made people now who 
I'm like,

162
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
you,
you talked to them and you're like,

163
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,140
oh you're really funny.
But then it's like they're there too 

164
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,980
forced and contrived on stage and you're
there.

165
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:08,510
You got to figure out how to make the 
guy who you are off stage just walk on.

166
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,810
There was a guy that was doing standup 
or I thought was really funny,

167
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,960
but he was doing this weird thing where 
he was talking so fast to do take this 

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,070
breath in between his essays and then 
the government if the government want to

169
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:24,071
do this Obama situation with gays in the
military and they and like he was going 

170
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,590
so fast,
like he kept taking this like in,

171
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,750
but it was like audible really loud like
a singer.

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,360
And especially if you're begged,
like you could focus on something like 

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,360
that.
Look for.

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,800
You could forget exactly what he's 
saying.

175
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,260
He's saying it down five,
four,

176
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,120
three,
two.

177
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,030
I would just focus on his crazy,
that little breath thing that he does.

178
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,000
You know,
it's just Joey Diaz.

179
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,980
When,
when I talked to him about it and I,

180
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:50,360
you know,
we've talked about it a bunch of times,

181
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:54,290
he says that what happened was he just 
realized how to not give a fuck.

182
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,530
He,
like he said he was too concerned with 

183
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,750
agents and managers and all that shit 
and he was too concerned with people 

184
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,070
giving them advice and he said it took,
you know,

185
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,220
like realizing somewhere along the line,
just realizing that these guys were all 

186
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,220
a bunch of dummies,
like seeing a bunch of them get fired,

187
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,490
seeing managers and agents fail 
miserably and fall by the wayside and 

188
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,600
executives get fired and the people that
hire people turn to drugs and become 

189
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,560
fucking chaos and mass.
And so he just had to realize like,

190
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,660
oh,
these aren't like intelligent.

191
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,450
This isn't like a,
a really like,

192
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:30,020
well set up artistic environment.
They don't know what they want.

193
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:32,510
They just want you to kill,
you know,

194
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,320
and they can tell you all day.
They want you to be squeaky clean,

195
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,030
you've got to do this.
But if you're dirty and you destroy,

196
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,420
they want,
you know,

197
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,540
so you've got like Katt Williams or you 
know,

198
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:46,541
of course Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock 
and all these different guys who have 

199
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:46,541
had,
you know,

200
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:50,540
Sam Kennison and dirty acts that,
but so hilarious that were,

201
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,650
they were undeniable.

202
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,490
So even in the era back then,
which was pre internet,

203
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:56,250
you know,
the Kennison days were all pre-internet,

204
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,860
which is way harder to be dirty because 
you only had hbo.

205
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,380
That was your only outlet for people to 
find out who the fuck you were.

206
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,580
Which is scary if you think about it.
Oh yeah.

207
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,280
The comparison to like what we have 
today,

208
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,110
you know.
But even then,

209
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,120
man,
all you have to do is be so good that 

210
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,120
they don't give a fuck so good that they
let it go.

211
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,350
And Joe,
he figured out how to do that,

212
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,030
you know.
But for the longest time,

213
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:16,020
man,
he couldn't do it.

214
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,400
It's,
it's hard to find a guy who gets it 

215
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,400
right.
It hard.

216
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,810
There was another guy,
Kurt Metzger,

217
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,370
I worked with him in Montreal this 
weekend.

218
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,920
Fucking hilarious.
Very funny.

219
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,300
He's very funny.
Super Funny,

220
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,310
really good.
There's just,

221
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:30,720
um,
there's just not enough.

222
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,750
There's not,
there's not enough good guys out there 

223
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,750
and he's another guy probably awake when
you saw and you're like,

224
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:35,890
who the fuck's this?
Well,

225
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,890
Ari had actually already told me he was 
funny.

226
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,000
He's really funny.
Yeah,

227
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,670
we were working this,
this little tiny club in Montreal.

228
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,330
I did,
um,

229
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,740
this theater called metropolis is like a
thousand seats or something like that.

230
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,970
And then the day before we did this 
local club called the comedy works,

231
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,580
which I used to do when I was living in 
Boston.

232
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,070
I was living in Boston,
one of my first road gigs.

233
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,760
I used to go up to the Scott.
Jimbo owns this club in Montreal.

234
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,470
It's the best club ever,
man.

235
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:06,471
It's fucking this tiny little room.
There's only like maybe 100 people can 

236
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:12,111
fit in.
They're all stuffed into this place and 

237
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,200
it's just old school man.
The microphone sucks.

238
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,370
The wall behind you.

239
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,420
Stupid fucking curtains over the windows
behind you.

240
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:21,270
And they have them covered with these 
old dusty fucked up curtains.

241
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,920
But it doesn't matter.
It's the best.

242
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:26,190
It's awesome.
It's just this little tight place and he

243
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:28,200
was a headline in there this week,
Kurt Metzger,

244
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,590
and he was really fucking funny and 
another one we hung out,

245
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,620
you know,
me and him and Ra went out and got 

246
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,620
something to eat and like I could tell 
right away.

247
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,100
Here's another comment.
He's,

248
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,760
he's a real comment.
Exactly.

249
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:39,770
Yeah.
There's just,

250
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,320
there's like a.
and it's cool like you really feel like,

251
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,000
like you want to,
when you meet guys like that,

252
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:50,001
are you still in touch with them?
You will be like soldiers on the 

253
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:50,001
battlefield,
you know,

254
00:10:50,001 --> 00:10:50,430
you run into each other like,
wow,

255
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,840
here we go.
We've got another one.

256
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,230
What people don't realize about 
comedians and it sounds,

257
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,660
screw that we're talking about this,
that and making a big deal out of it,

258
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,670
but there's not that many of them.

259
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,380
When you look at the world,
okay,

260
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:03,480
look at the United States.
Let's just look at our country.

261
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,550
Three hundred million people in the 
United States.

262
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,930
How many comedians there might be a 
thousand,

263
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,990
might be a thousand professional 
comedians at 300 million.

264
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,190
How many of them are actually funny?
It might be 300,

265
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,670
maybe 300 out of a thousand.
And that's being generous.

266
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,090
Yeah.
So there's 300 people at a $300 million.

267
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,060
That's one in a million.
Yeah,

268
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,730
that's bananas.
I said bananas again early.

269
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,710
I said bananas like Fifty Times last 
week.

270
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,800
And I said I wasn't gonna say it this 
way,

271
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,620
that's my latest thing,
man.

272
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,790
Whenever anything is crazy,
I go 19 sixties on myself.

273
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,730
I,
I go,

274
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,490
I repeat the shit out of,
uh,

275
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,740
out of control.
Say something's out of control.

276
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,820
And I say fired up.
Well,

277
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,160
the problem is when you do it in a two 
hour podcast once a week after a while,

278
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,870
people like to,
we shut the fuck up,

279
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,871
but the bananas are,
you're listening to a guy like say the 

280
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:56,871
same words.

281
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,810
It's like you realize when you do 
something like this,

282
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:01,440
how important it is to vary,
you know,

283
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,360
your speech and not get locked into 
patterns of behavior.

284
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,070
You know,
you ever heard like rappers,

285
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:06,800
who y'all.
I'm saying,

286
00:12:06,801 --> 00:12:08,980
you know what I'm saying?
I'm saying the Kimbo slice does.

287
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,270
You know what I'm saying?
Like every other word.

288
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,860
And I'm Sam,
he had to put these things on,

289
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,840
you know what I'm saying?
Like,

290
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,260
yeah,
yeah,

291
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,270
yeah.
Of course I've heard so many interviews 

292
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,071
with athletes would say that it's,
it's know what I'm saying after 

293
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:24,061
everything.
And what's hilarious is when you hear 

294
00:12:24,061 --> 00:12:24,670
comics used nigger like,
like a rapper will use nigger.

295
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,270
And this Nigga tried to tell me,
I'm like,

296
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,330
Nigga,
you better get the fuck out my face 

297
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,330
Nigga.
I know what the fuck's going on Nigga.

298
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,430
And like they'll,
they'll say it's so many times and 

299
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:34,430
they'll say it on stage.

300
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,770
The way guys will say it offstage,
you know,

301
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,340
there's something that gets lost when 
you do that,

302
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:43,590
you know,
you got to recognize that like free 

303
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,130
speech offstage is not good enough to be
bottled up and packaged.

304
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,660
You know,
you're going to sell it.

305
00:12:46,661 --> 00:12:51,661
You can't,
you got to have a better economy of 

306
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:53,821
words.
Like I'll catch myself sometimes saying 

307
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:56,071
fuck too much on stage because it's just
natural because you do it in real life 

308
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,490
like this fucking guy in his stupid 
fucking idea.

309
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,800
But you can't.
If you do that,

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,370
it,
it,

311
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,450
it fucks up the bits because you,
the lows,

312
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,670
any potential impact,
you know,

313
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:09,790
the concept.
You people get distracted by you saying,

314
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,250
even though this is just how you express
yourself in a natural,

315
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,360
people will get distracted if you use 
too many of the same words over and over

316
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:17,800
again,
like a swear like fuck,

317
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,090
you know,
if you use it over and over and over 

318
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:23,090
again,
like in like more than one sentence,

319
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:27,480
you could do it for one bit.
Like if you're just so ridiculously 

320
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:27,730
upset at something,
you know that you just.

321
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,160
And it's part of what you're doing,
but then you have to make sure that you,

322
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,220
there's a peak and a valley in your app.
You have to make sure that once you hit 

323
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,141
like all these extra fucks,
like there's no fucks coming for awhile 

324
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:40,141
after that.
Yeah.

325
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:40,141
Yeah.
Because

326
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:43,910
then like when you do it a lot also like
in one bit,

327
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:47,540
if you say fuck like 100 times,
you realize that you're essentially,

328
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:52,430
it's replacing other words that could 
make that bit funnier.

329
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,090
And it's more like an ah,
it's like a replacement for a,

330
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:58,330
like this a guy,
um ha.

331
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,470
So it's like you're just kind of 
admitting that you don't have a cohesive

332
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:03,010
idea.

333
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:08,210
The other one,
like I used to do this all the time and 

334
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,731
now I do it less,
but I still catch myself going into it 

335
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,520
is saying like one of your saying a bit 
then going right at the end of it and 

336
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,700
you don't realize you're,
you're saying it,

337
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,780
but you're going because you're trying 
to basically validate what you're 

338
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:19,780
saying.
So like,

339
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,540
like sort of subconsciously I would say 
a sentence and be like,

340
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:22,980
right?
And then I walked in,

341
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:24,090
right?
And the guy was like,

342
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,230
right?
And then I listen to it.

343
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,200
I'm like,
that sounds fucking like,

344
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,140
like an imposter

345
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,200
fucking idiot right now.
That's why it's so important to listen 

346
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,200
to your shit.
Oh yeah.

347
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,700
So important to watch your stuff and 
listen to your stuff.

348
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:39,390
And it's so painful.
Like people think that comedians like,

349
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:40,080
look,
me up there.

350
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm killing when,
when I watch my stuff,

351
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,090
even stuff that I did that I like,
I don't like watching it.

352
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:47,940
Like even talking monkey's in space,
which was like my best special.

353
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,530
I don't like watching that fucking 
thing.

354
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:51,710
It feels gross.
I hate watching man.

355
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,290
It's just a and,
and then you start judging your bits and

356
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:54,830
go,
Ooh,

357
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,020
I don't even have the new tagline when I
did this.

358
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,590
Like sometimes you'll do a bit and the 
right after you come up with his bed,

359
00:15:00,591 --> 00:15:01,690
it's like you know,
you,

360
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:06,691
you think you've got it nailed and you 
put it on a cd and then like a week 

361
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:07,790
later you have the best fucking tagline.

362
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,790
It changes the whole bit.
It makes it so much better.

363
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,160
You want to like go back in time.
You want to,

364
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,840
you want to rewind yourself and,
and,

365
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,790
and not release it.
I started,

366
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:21,791
I started on this.
I already have like a few things I to 

367
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:22,160
too and I'm like,
Oh man,

368
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,190
I know.
And people who don't do it don't 

369
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:27,620
understand how maddening that is.
That's why I like a lot of comics have a

370
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,330
hard time.
Once you do your set,

371
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,850
you just want to get out of there and 
move on with your life.

372
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:36,851
You don't want to like really objective.
We go over all the beats and trying to 

373
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,210
figure out what you did wrong and what 
you did right.

374
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,920
But if you don't do that,
man,

375
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:40,450
it's,
it's,

376
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,410
it's just not as.
It's not as good.

377
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,380
You have to make sure that.

378
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,470
Yeah,
you have to,

379
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,770
you have to look at your stuff,
man.

380
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,850
This is the hope.
Doesn't

381
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,930
volume meters or right.
Way Up towards the red is like on the 

382
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:55,930
Austrian producer.
That's how you get it.

383
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,850
As loud as we can.
People still complain about this shit.

384
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,020
I,
uh,

385
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,710
you know,
the,

386
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:05,711
the fact that I have brian that he 
records almost all my sets that's so 

387
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:05,900
huge for that.
It's helped me so much

388
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,310
that I'm super and also like there's 
little things that he does.

389
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,370
Like I'm just saying,
I guess it's just an all around 

390
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:14,370
appraiser Brian,
but like,

391
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,640
it's so cool.
I always dug like the posters that you'd

392
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:15,960
like,
just.

393
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,450
Yeah.
Yeah.

394
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:17,840
All those,
those are awesome.

395
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,260
That makes those,
did they really know?

396
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,410
And he captured a lot of cool shit 
offstage.

397
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,120
Yeah,
that's awesome man.

398
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,170
It's like one of the best things about 
the internet is being able to connect 

399
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:30,570
with people like that.
Just Weirdo fucking creative people,

400
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,170
you know.
And then in Brian's case he brought up 

401
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,170
working for me.

402
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,930
I think you're,
do you think like of all like the 

403
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,620
working like big name comics,
you're probably on top of it the most,

404
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:41,820
right?
Like media,

405
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,410
like Internet stuff,

406
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,250
cooks probably better at it than me.
The,

407
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,450
the whole like twitter shit.
Now the reason why I even got into that 

408
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:52,450
is because I saw what it was doing for 
him.

409
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,360
That's a fact for like I was feeling 
people compare,

410
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:58,790
like try to compare him to other 
comedians with shady,

411
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,890
uh,
reputations,

412
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,770
you know,
I say Dan has done a lot more for comedy

413
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:07,210
then like I was like by a long shot 
because he's,

414
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,910
he's like opened up people's eyes to 
what you could do yourself.

415
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,410
Sure.
Because before that,

416
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,430
the,
the reality is none of us are the type 

417
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:17,430
of guys that are going to be self 
promoters.

418
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,850
Like comics are not self promoters.
It's just not normal.

419
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,150
He's an aberration.
Dane Cook is an unnatural thing,

420
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:23,690
like,
well,

421
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:28,691
I don't know if it's an unnatural thing,
but it goes contrary to what I was 

422
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:28,691
talking about.

423
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:31,990
I was doing the sit Rosenthal show on 
the radio before I did this and we were 

424
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,651
talking about like he was saying,
rank yourself amongst comedians and 

425
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:39,280
comedians.
That's the last thing you ever want to 

426
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,280
think about is where do I stand?
You know,

427
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,580
is this guy better than me or that guy 
better than me?

428
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:43,940
You don't want to judge yourself.
You just want to just try to concentrate

429
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,970
all your energy on doing the best shit.
The last thing you want to concentrate 

430
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,550
on is pumping up your own ego and you 
know,

431
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,150
just or even judging yourself at all 
would judge the material.

432
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,400
Go over the material,
look at it,

433
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,920
try to make it better,
but always be focused on that.

434
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,430
Like the like putting out the best shit.
That's what you're focused on.

435
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,040
Not like where you fit in with everybody
else.

436
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,840
That's,
that's like an an enemy.

437
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,410
That's like the enemy of creativity is 
that kind of ego shit.

438
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,280
When you get involved.

439
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:11,980
Yeah.
Yeah.

440
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,020
And it's also like the one thing,
I mean I always feel like the one thing 

441
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,970
you can control like for sure is what 
you're writing and doing.

442
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,390
So it's like,
like you really can't control the other 

443
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:27,851
shit.
Like if somebody wanted to put you on 

444
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:27,851
the 10 best list of comics,

445
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:32,390
right?
Or like the tendons right before you 

446
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,390
that you hate,
that you hate,

447
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,290
like you think he sucks,
it's out of your control.

448
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,700
So I think it's absurd to even like I 
saw,

449
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:40,870
I just saw a list of the 10 comics to 
watch and it was like,

450
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,190
like I,
you know,

451
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,370
I mean it's all subjective but I'm like,
this is,

452
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,400
this is absolute.
Like some of it was cool and so it was 

453
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,400
like,
who is this?

454
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Why are they.
I know that one.

455
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Mercy.
No,

456
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,680
it's doing something like that.
Why don't they,

457
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,480
I mean there's always got to be a 
number,

458
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,690
you know,
the fucking seven comments you want to 

459
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,031
look out for.
How much does do something on someone 

460
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:01,031
you think is funny?
You know,

461
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:03,470
this whole like what's the best bands?
The bands that you like,

462
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,480
I'd probably think fucking suck,
you know,

463
00:19:05,481 --> 00:19:07,550
and there's a lot of shit that I liked 
that sucks.

464
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,960
A lot of people think it's sucks,
you know,

465
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,660
like you know,
that of the fray,

466
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,320
how to save a life is one of the gay 
songs of all time.

467
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,090
Alright.
But I fucking like it.

468
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,790
I like it.
I know people say it sucks.

469
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,950
I know that if I played it at a party 
with all my friends,

470
00:19:21,951 --> 00:19:23,060
they'd be live.
I prayed it loud.

471
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:24,800
They be like,
what the fuck are you doing?

472
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,820
But I,

473
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,640
I love it.
There's a lot of like,

474
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,470
like nineties R and B,
that

475
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,660
shit like swv once swd sisters with 
voice,

476
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,860
it's absurd and I will fucking crank 
that shit in my car and go like,

477
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:44,390
give me,
give me,

478
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,610
give you a sample of it.
There's,

479
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,060
should we find it yet?
There's supposedly some way that I can.

480
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,930
I can do some fucking screenshot here

481
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,180
and drag the stuff in,
but I fucked it all up so I don't know 

482
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,180
how to do that.
But we'll go to youtube.

483
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,370
The beautiful thing about youtube is you
could find pretty much anything but 

484
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,740
sisters with voices are your sisters' 
stipend.

485
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,640
SWV is be better that way.
Okay.

486
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,130
SWV.
Yeah.

487
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,950
You're gonna.
I mean it's gonna be ridiculous to you.

488
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,700
Okay.
There's one where right here.

489
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,780
Human Nature,
man.

490
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Here we go.
Ladies and gentlemen brought to you by 

491
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:24,920
the power of cable.

492
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,990
This is Michael Jackson.
They're using a loop from that.

493
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,220
They ripped off Michael Jackson and 
they're fishing the fishing and the 

494
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,940
matching brooks brothers gear on.
Oh Shit.

495
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,510
This isn't bad enough.

496
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,860
Sorry fellow.
That's not bad enough that you're gonna.

497
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,760
Show me something bad.
It's got to be really bad.

498
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,740
Not Good.
Not Good.

499
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,620
Not Good.
That atrocious.

500
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,330
Do you let you ever hear like what the 
fuck?

501
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,380
It's hard out here in the D.
There's a fucking rap song.

502
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,290
Hold on.

503
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,900
Oh,
and do you ever.

504
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:20,901
Do you ever do dig like a.
A lot of people on the Internet know 

505
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:20,901
what I'm talking.

506
00:21:20,901 --> 00:21:23,950
It's hard out here in the D is like one 
of the worst fucking rap songs ever.

507
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,690
Like,
it's so bad.

508
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,750
It's these.
Did these Detroit people.

509
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,250
Fuck.
Where is it?

510
00:21:31,251 --> 00:21:32,390
It's not.
That's not it.

511
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,900
You dig this though?
It's so bad.

512
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:36,950
It's awesome.
Yeah.

513
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,440
Do you like ever like,
like a techno song?

514
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,590
Sometimes.
Most of the time I find that stuff to be

515
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:44,340
logged.
Annoying.

516
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:44,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

517
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,930
But so every once in a while one will 
catch you.

518
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,410
Right.
You know,

519
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:49,370
it's different though.
If I'm hammered in matter club.

520
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:53,170
Oh yeah.
Then you'll just get interested in music

521
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:58,171
that you ordinarily wouldn't get 
interested in because it's so cold in 

522
00:21:58,171 --> 00:21:58,171
the day.
Is that it?

523
00:21:58,171 --> 00:21:58,510
Is it so cold in the day?
It might be.

524
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:58,920
Right sir.

525
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,450
This is another thing.
This so called in the day.

526
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,110
Is this something that you should have 
never found out about that?

527
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,350
Here it is.
This is it.

528
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,650
So cold and I'm no saint,
you know,

529
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,690
China to some dude trying to get people 
to watch them.

530
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,390
There's all these kids that have shows 
on the Internet.

531
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,980
It never known any.
Stumble on one.

532
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:29,050
Like this guy,
this guy,

533
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,340
he's got 300 fucking thousand views on 
one of these videos.

534
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,430
Here it is.
It's so cold in the date and this is so 

535
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:38,430
bad.
Dude,

536
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,200
I don't know why this is broadcast.
You mean

537
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,360
I didn't meet immediately.
A gentleman.

538
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:26,380
I don't know what I'm doing here.

539
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,990
You should have.
It's so cold and z.

540
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,180
that's for real.
Wow.

541
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,870
How'd you find those?
Dude?

542
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,960
Why don't we have to.

543
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,990
I have to figure out how to do this.
There's no way,

544
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,360
Brian,
when Brian not here,

545
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,420
Brian is off at some fucking crazy 
adventure and when Brian's not here,

546
00:23:53,421 --> 00:23:55,070
I have no idea how to work all this 
shit,

547
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,910
but I do have some fucking serious high 
tech MP3 type recorder shit now.

548
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,510
And these regular microphones,
if you guys have any complaints,

549
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,820
I love to hear them.
You know,

550
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,500
if you have a problem with a sound or,
or,

551
00:24:08,501 --> 00:24:11,070
or anything else,
like fucking keep it coming.

552
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,810
I like to try and make this thing as 
good as I can.

553
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,070
Anyway.
So what we're talking about comedians 

554
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,070
and uh,
I was telling you earlier.

555
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,310
Oh the fleshlight that was the thing I 
want to talk about.

556
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,130
Have you ever fucked one of those?
No House.

557
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:28,590
Can I ever fucked one of those?
You know,

558
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,890
is this really a sponsor of yours?

559
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,850
Yes.
Really?

560
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,420
Yes.
I'm sponsored now by much to the fucking

561
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,170
angst of my management company.
Wow.

562
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,400
This is Jennifer [inaudible] butthole.
Magenta is butthole.

563
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,460
Yeah.
I don't know.

564
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,630
It smells like someone's butt hole.
What?

565
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,210
Just rubber?
Just,

566
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,760
it doesn't smell.
It doesn't smell good.

567
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,340
Well,
you could always put some rosy side,

568
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,040
but um,
these fucking things.

569
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:00,310
My manager was.
This is the craziest thing that anyone 

570
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,610
has ever given me.
When they give me advice and I'm like,

571
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,170
it's,
it's a masturbation to it.

572
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,610
What's the big deal?
And he's like,

573
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:09,611
well,
it's pornographic because I guess it's 

574
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:09,611
like a rubber pussy.
And I go,

575
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:09,770
how's it pornographic?
I,

576
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,140
it's a masturbation tonight.
How's that pornographic?

577
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,060
It's a fake vagina.
He goes,

578
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,770
well,
you use it when you watch pornography.

579
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,390
That doesn't make sense.
Look terrible places that you use it 

580
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,420
while you watch pornography.
And then our,

581
00:25:24,421 --> 00:25:25,100
she feared goes.

582
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,130
So by that standard,
my sock is pornographic.

583
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,040
Just,
you know?

584
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,120
Yeah.
What the fuck?

585
00:25:32,121 --> 00:25:32,930
Bad.
Come on.

586
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,740
That's,
that's,

587
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,890
that's pornographic or rubber buddle.
Then my stomach is really pornographic.

588
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,890
The idea is that we're still living in 
this childish world.

589
00:25:42,891 --> 00:25:47,891
We're supposed to pretend that you don't
masturbate and if you're admitting the 

590
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:47,891
cms rate,
which we all should,

591
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:51,190
there's nothing fucking wrong with it.
This is way better than jerking off.

592
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,430
Can I see it?
Oh my goodness.

593
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,070
This is so good,
man.

594
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,220
It's way better.
You squirt some lube in there and you 

595
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,220
fuck the shit out.
Have you done it?

596
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Yeah,
I've done it.

597
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,220
That's awesome.
Not this one.

598
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,330
Not that I wouldn't do that to you.
Thanks man.

599
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,640
Oh Wow.
It's really soft.

600
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,760
Oh Dude.
It's the.

601
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,770
They have some sort of special patent on
what the vagina and butthole rubber is 

602
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:11,450
made out of.

603
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,930
It's like some special fucking thing.
That's great,

604
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:16,040
man.
It's outstanding.

605
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,620
It's 100 times better than beating off 
and I'm not joking.

606
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,340
Really.
I'm not.

607
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,290
I'm not being a sell out here.
Look,

608
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,350
don't buy if you don't want to buy it.
I'm not saying that should go out and 

609
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,350
buy it.
I mean,

610
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,051
there's a lot of other things.
I'm sure that you'd probably need your 

611
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,091
life more than you need a rubber vagina,
but if you're in the market from rubber 

612
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:32,690
vagina,
I fucking highly recommended.

613
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,750
If you're the type of dude who jerks off
and we all,

614
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:41,420
especially if you do it,
you didn't say like a daily thing to 

615
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:41,420
you.
That's way better.

616
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:41,420
It's,
I can't even,

617
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,840
without getting too graphic,
I can't even describe how much better it

618
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:48,210
is.
All I'm saying is lazy checks.

619
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:53,300
Okay.
You're going to have to pick up your 

620
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,300
game.

621
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:53,300
This is just the beginning.
Okay.

622
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:57,980
Once they figured out this,
what they figured out that the most 

623
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,921
difficult part,
they figured out a way to master an 

624
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:00,921
artificial vagina.
It's,

625
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,280
they mastered it.
It's really fantastic.

626
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,050
Fantastic.
I'm not bullshitting you.

627
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,220
It's not like some hard rubber thing.
It feels like a pleasant.

628
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,440
It's incredible.
I will sample one and we will get you 

629
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:12,480
one and we will,
uh,

630
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,570
we'll get him.
One will have a Chris from a fleshlight 

631
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,160
send one over to Tommy and Tommy will 
come back on the broadcast in the future

632
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:22,470
after he's fucked it up and it'll tell 
us all about it.

633
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,730
It's,
I mean,

634
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,020
I'm telling you,
man,

635
00:27:25,021 --> 00:27:26,820
for the longest time,
and this was Chris,

636
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:31,821
the guy who worked for the company was 
describing it to me for the longest 

637
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:35,301
time.
Women always have vibrators and dildos 

638
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:35,301
and this and that and rabbits and,
and the,

639
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:38,220
the fucking Sybian no one ever had 
anything like that for dudes.

640
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,120
It's kind of weird,
man.

641
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,900
Well,
not only that,

642
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:44,640
it's like you're some kind of a fucking 
loser if you go and buy any of that shit

643
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:49,641
anyway.
If you're one of those dudes who goes 

644
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:51,471
out and buys like,
like a rubber rubber pussy to fuck at 

645
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,740
some sex shop,
you know,

646
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:00,140
most guys are never gonna get past the 
embarrassment of walking through those 

647
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,460
beads in a sex shop.
It's horrifying.

648
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,850
And trying out all the different rubber 
pussies,

649
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,410
you know what I'm saying?
Even know which ones for you,

650
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,890
you know,
oh,

651
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:10,920
this one vibrates.
Do you really want your Dick to vibrate?

652
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:11,790
No,
probably not.

653
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:12,790
It's like,
it's like you're,

654
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,310
you know,
you're fucking a shaver.

655
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,680
Why?
Why?

656
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,320
Why would you want it to vibrate?
No.

657
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,460
So you'd have to like either that or 
you'd have to go get what?

658
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:23,070
A magazine that reviews,
hi,

659
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,400
my name is Harry and I fucked everything
because this is what I think,

660
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,840
you know,
it's fucking.

661
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,840
It was difficult.
But because of the Internet now all you 

662
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,360
have to do is you'd go to fleshlight.com
or whatever and you order it,

663
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:34,550
you know?
Yeah.

664
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,150
It makes total sense actually.
Is it,

665
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:38,910
is it easy to clean up to.
Yes.

666
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,940
It's very easy to clean up.
I think this thing is getting me off of 

667
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,250
here.
No,

668
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,040
no.
Okay.

669
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,590
I don't understand.
Yeah,

670
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,230
it's super easy to clean up.
You,

671
00:28:49,231 --> 00:28:50,520
uh,
you unscrewed the top,

672
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:53,070
you put it in the foss and cleans it 
out.

673
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,450
It's fucking,
it's nothing.

674
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,000
I mean it's kind of gross.
You feel like a total loser and once you

675
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:00,150
just shot a load and post you never feel
like a winner.

676
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,970
But that's but actually goes along with 
all masturbation.

677
00:29:02,971 --> 00:29:05,850
I always feel like a loser when my load 
shooting.

678
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,020
The whole joke about it,
a whole bit about no matter what,

679
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,170
like when it's over,
like relevance,

680
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,950
no matter who you are,
you're a loser.

681
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,950
You can be Michael Jordan when you're 
just sitting there with a load in your 

682
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,681
stomach,
you get that heavy breathing kind of 

683
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:21,681
comes to an end.
And you know,

684
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:26,100
I always say that I feel the same way 
after I jerk off as well as what I,

685
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:31,101
uh,
when I play xbox for like nine hours in 

686
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:31,101
a row,
that same feeling,

687
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:31,510
you just,
what am I doing versus loser,

688
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,570
you're a loser.
You got a bunch of shit you were 

689
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,271
supposed to do and now it's two in the 
morning and you have to go to bed and 

690
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:38,271
you didn't do shit.
You fucking loser.

691
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:39,260
I'm weak.
That's what I tell him.

692
00:29:39,261 --> 00:29:40,530
I said,
if you're a person,

693
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,110
do you,
uh,

694
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,670
do you struggle a lot of comics struggle
with self indulgence?

695
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:47,830
Do you struggle with that big time?
Yeah.

696
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,950
Well God,
that's definitely probably so hard when 

697
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:52,950
no one's telling you what time you have 
to get up.

698
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:57,181
It's so hard not to just get up at noon,
just beat off all over yourself and go 

699
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:57,181
right back.

700
00:29:57,181 --> 00:30:01,100
You're describing like the last few 
years of my life and I'm with that.

701
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm like that with everything.
Like I like to.

702
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,560
It's all about like sleeping in,
jerking off,

703
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,400
eating good food and anything that feels
good.

704
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,010
I'm surprised I don't have needles in my
arms sometimes.

705
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,260
We were,
you and I were on the road once and we 

706
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,040
decided to get krispy Kreme donuts at 
like 1:00

707
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,510
in the morning we went off.
Where the fuck was that man?

708
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,340
Was that Tampa?
Was it?

709
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,740
Wait,
no,

710
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:24,620
if it was.
Yeah.

711
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,270
Well it wasn't crispy cream though,
right?

712
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:28,880
Or was it Krispy Kreme?
I think it was or maybe it wasn't.

713
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,920
It was some,
some awesome donuts.

714
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,960
Whatever the fuck it was.
But dude,

715
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:36,740
we attack those bitches and we both knew
that we really shouldn't be doing it.

716
00:30:36,741 --> 00:30:37,880
And you had to slip like,
all right,

717
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:38,540
fuck it,
let's go.

718
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,570
It was just like as if I asked you to do
go do some crank with me.

719
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,700
I haven't been doing it,
but fuck it.

720
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:44,000
Let's go ahead,

721
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,130
but then I'm most like,
like if somebody gives me permission,

722
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:52,470
that's what it's like.
I'm kind of like going through life 

723
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,470
waiting for somebody to give me 
permission.

724
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,550
If somebody is like,
do you want to do this because I'm going

725
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:57,600
to do this,
then I go,

726
00:30:57,870 --> 00:30:58,620
I have no control.

727
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,010
Yeah.
What is that man?

728
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:03,100
What is that about?
Comedians that just like I'm looking for

729
00:31:03,101 --> 00:31:07,030
any excuse to do the wrong thing.
That's what feels good.

730
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,270
What feels good to do the wrong shit?
It's because what?

731
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:15,271
Because what makes you become a comedian
is you're resisting everything that 

732
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:17,440
everybody else wants you to do.
You're resisting resisting,

733
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:19,570
being polite because you're thinking 
route shit,

734
00:31:19,571 --> 00:31:22,690
which is why you're funny.
You're saying that roots shit to get the

735
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:24,430
laughs from people.
So you're disturbing.

736
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:26,260
Everybody know,
so you're,

737
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,580
you're,
you're resisting.

738
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Like the way to become good and it 
become funny is to be the guy that's 

739
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,001
willing to say that shit.
I mean that's why so many people say 

740
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:36,001
about comedians like,
like,

741
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:36,120
oh dude,
I can't.

742
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,980
You say shit that I think about all the 
time,

743
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,420
but I never have the guts to say.
I mean,

744
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:42,090
how many times do people say it's 
absolutely about,

745
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:45,070
especially if you nail some current 
events issue they do.

746
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,480
That's exactly what I thought,
but I didn't have the balls to say that,

747
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:52,270
that,
that willingness to say shit that's like

748
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:55,180
inappropriate or that other people would
think was offensive.

749
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
That's like what makes you a comic in 
the first place?

750
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,600
Sure.
You know,

751
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:03,601
so it's like,
it's all like a part of your whole 

752
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:03,601
system.
I go,

753
00:32:03,601 --> 00:32:07,010
you want to your,
it's almost like we're designed to like 

754
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:10,500
not fit in,
were designed to like just step away 

755
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,131
from all of it and poke fun at it.
So it makes it so hard to fucking get 

756
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:14,131
your shit together.
Yeah,

757
00:32:14,131 --> 00:32:16,570
it does man.
This is so hard to be disciplined and to

758
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,340
just show up for anything on time.

759
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,520
But like,
but you got to have like you have 

760
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,520
discipline though,
right?

761
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,520
I mean as a,

762
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:23,950
I have some,
I'm not the best at it.

763
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,970
I,
I forced myself to do certain things 

764
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:28,970
because I know that like,
like with my body,

765
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,470
I'm a naturally,
uh,

766
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,370
like I have a lot of energy,
you know,

767
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,870
and I have a lot of aggressive energy 
and I,

768
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,840
my whole life I've been doing martial 
arts since I was a child,

769
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,150
so it's like literally there's

770
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,620
been no time or I haven't done it that 
something,

771
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:45,010
whether it's kickboxing or Jujitsu or 
something,

772
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:50,020
there's that explosive,
like expenditure of energy has always 

773
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:53,561
been a part of my life.
So if I take time off and I don't do it 

774
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:54,020
for like three or four days or something
like that,

775
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,280
I started getting really antsy and I get
this buildup and I just fucking,

776
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:03,290
I just,
I just want to get it out and I get 

777
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:03,620
annoyed and traffic and I snap at people
when I shouldn't be snapping.

778
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,690
I get upset about things that I 
shouldn't get upset at,

779
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,090
you know,
but when I'm not doing that,

780
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,540
when I'm,
when I'm training all the time and I'm,

781
00:33:10,541 --> 00:33:13,160
I'm,
I'm even down just so mellow.

782
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:17,090
It's like I feel like I can be me now,
go enjoy life more.

783
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:22,091
I feel like there's less stress in my 
body so I can interpret the outside 

784
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:22,850
stress way better.

785
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,220
So it's almost like dictated by your,
by your,

786
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,890
the way you operate to be that way.
Well,

787
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:28,820
you know,
and it's also,

788
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:33,821
you know,
the way my mind developed to growing up 

789
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:36,701
I,
we moved a lot around a lot and I don't 

790
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:36,701
know,
my dad,

791
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:37,550
I haven't talked to him since I was six 
years old or seven.

792
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,630
I haven't seen him since I was six.
I haven't talked to him since I was 

793
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,831
seven.
So I was raised by my stepfather and we 

794
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:44,831
moved around a lot so I always had to 
like,

795
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:47,930
like fight against a lot of kids in 
different neighborhoods.

796
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,880
There's always a lot of bullshit that I 
had to fight against.

797
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:54,881
So my,
my instincts are always to resist all 

798
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:58,151
the shit that's going on because people 
are just going to say stupid shit and 

799
00:33:58,151 --> 00:33:58,151
get you in bad situations.
Like,

800
00:33:58,151 --> 00:33:59,090
so I grew up with that.

801
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,310
And then the physical thing,
like fighting thing.

802
00:34:01,311 --> 00:34:04,010
So it's all was resisting.
Everything's resisting,

803
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,390
which is,
you know,

804
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:10,010
terrible because then you resist your 
own direction and your own ideas and you

805
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:11,210
can have like a plan like,
Hey,

806
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:13,250
I'm going to take care of my body,
I'm going to,

807
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:18,251
you know,
eat certain foods because they're 

808
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:18,251
healthy,
they're going to work out,

809
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:21,971
you know,
in a certain time every day because 

810
00:34:21,971 --> 00:34:23,741
that's what I really need to get done.
I'm going to start writing material 

811
00:34:23,741 --> 00:34:25,400
every day even though it's for you and 
it's a good thing and you'll enjoy every

812
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:30,401
single moment of all of it.
You still resist doing it because it's 

813
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:33,881
some sort of a plan and anything that's 
a plan is like all the other stupid 

814
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:33,881
shit.

815
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:33,881
Yeah,
yeah,

816
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:34,230
exactly.
Yeah.

817
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:39,231
And that's Kinda like,
I think every comic has that resistance 

818
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:43,920
to for the most part,
like this is how this is the status quo,

819
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,170
a big part of it,
right?

820
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:46,290
Yeah.

821
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,940
That's kind of like why you're a standup
because you,

822
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,800
you,
you,

823
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:55,130
it's weird because like the resistance 
makes you a comic and at the same time 

824
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,370
to a degree,
if you're resistant to too much,

825
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,140
it will hold you back from doing well.

826
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,230
Yeah,
that comedy,

827
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:04,260
but you have to realize somewhere along 
the line that the reason why you got 

828
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,011
into comedy is probably a bad reason.
And for most of us it's like we want an 

829
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:10,500
unnecessary amount of adulation.
We want an,

830
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,620
an,
you know,

831
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,920
we want more attention than the other 
people do because we feel like we didn't

832
00:35:14,921 --> 00:35:16,070
get it when we were young.
Right?

833
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,960
Crazy buildup.
But then somewhere along the line your 

834
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,661
motivation has to switch.
You have to kind of understand what it 

835
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:24,661
really is.
You know,

836
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:28,650
the way that,
what I always say about it is like at a 

837
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,451
certain point in time there,
there's got to be a transition in your 

838
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:34,081
life as a comedian where you start doing
it for the work and for the art and for 

839
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:38,641
the creation of something that joy and 
making something that people enjoy 

840
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:38,641
instead of

841
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:43,610
doing it so that people will like you 
doing it so that you can get all this 

842
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,160
attention and adulation on stage,
you know,

843
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:45,750
because that's what,
when you won the beginning,

844
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,700
you just want to be the fucking man and 
just want to get out there,

845
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,460
kill you want,
do you want approval?

846
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:56,090
We want people to be like your great.
And then if you have a great set and 

847
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,720
people tell you stuff and you realize 
how validating it was,

848
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,970
then you,
then you realize how desperate you were.

849
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,430
You know what I mean?
Like when you feel so good,

850
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,070
like you're so valid,
so happy by that,

851
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,650
that great show early on,
you just like,

852
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,540
how bad did I need that rubbing that I 
fucking need people to be like,

853
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,450
oh,
you're the.

854
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,430
You're so amazing.

855
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,520
It's weird though because that's the 
only thing that really creates comedy 

856
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,361
though.
Otherwise you probably are not going to 

857
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:28,361
be motivated enough to go through the 
beginning.

858
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:28,940
Yeah,
yeah,

859
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:30,480
yeah.
Because how brutal the beginning.

860
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,440
It's awful.
It's awful,

861
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:37,450
man.
People don't know how painful it is to 

862
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,401
Obama on stage and how deserving it is.
Like you fucking deserved a bomb when 

863
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,820
you know you really do deserve it.
You know when you're bombing,

864
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:48,821
it's because you fucking really do suck 
and you're supposed to fill that shitty 

865
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:49,700
because you're not supposed to be 
demanding attention.

866
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,820
You're not supposed to be with a 
microphone with an amplified voice.

867
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,860
You're not hearing opinions.
Not that interesting.

868
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,610
And all these people hear that and it 
just drives me fucking nuts,

869
00:36:58,611 --> 00:37:00,360
man.
You're not well thought out you.

870
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,910
You haven't lived that much.
Probably if you started young enough,

871
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,700
you don't have that much experience.

872
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,110
You don't know what you're talking 
about.

873
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,110
Fucking 21 years old.
You think you're smart,

874
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:10,020
but you're not.
You know,

875
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,080
because like when you.
It's like being your age now.

876
00:37:12,081 --> 00:37:13,610
When you look back at yourself 10 years 
ago,

877
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:14,480
he's like,
I'm a fucking idiot.

878
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:19,540
Is there anything worse than 21 year old
kids that think they have the fucking 

879
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,740
political system?
Wired talk about politics on stage.

880
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,850
Oh,
it's the worst man.

881
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,790
It really tears you up.
It's so silly.

882
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:30,791
It's like it's one thing if they have a 
valid point or a silly point or 

883
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,631
something like that,
but when they start telling you what's 

884
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,020
wrong with Republicans and the Democrats
are trying to do this,

885
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:41,021
but the Republicans are trying to do 
that and they're stopping them and 

886
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:41,021
they're like,
what are you fucking what?

887
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,570
Yeah,
it's,

888
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,260
it's no.
It's almost like I'm at a loss for words

889
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:48,170
sometimes.
You asked me fucking old ass shit for me

890
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:50,010
to take you serious.
When it comes to politics,

891
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:55,030
you have to know that you've been paying
attention to this at least at least 

892
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,040
abstractly for fucking decades because 
you have to be old

893
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,910
in order to get to have even a somewhat 
objective,

894
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,960
like unemotional opinion about it.
Young people just go like,

895
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,160
this is fucked up,
man.

896
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,440
Like they're not looking at it for what 
it really is.

897
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,740
They're looking at it from their 
hardcore bias towards one side or the 

898
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,971
other.
They're not telling you what really is 

899
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:18,971
going on.
They're just like,

900
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:19,400
I really disagree with what the other 
people are doing.

901
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,510
Which is like,
that's your.

902
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,710
That's just your fucking opinion.

903
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,070
Do you guys hear that water?
Is that water annoying?

904
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,950
Mrs Rogan's running the fucking hose.
Essentially low red podcast situation.

905
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,260
Although let me tell her to stop taking.

906
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,900
Oh,
Tommy talked about your childhood.

907
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,610
My childhood,
it was really bad.

908
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,820
That was beaten and hit a lot and I did 
a lot of drugs.

909
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,530
Stick to the script.
Oh,

910
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,480
that's nice.
Oh Wow.

911
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:55,420
That was quick.
No,

912
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,070
no water.
They do

913
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,100
near the water.
There was water going on in the 

914
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,831
background.
This is from my days working on fear 

915
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,240
factor.
We always have to check for sound issues

916
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:11,241
in the background.
Like occasionally it'll be planes with 

917
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:13,290
flowers have to stop filming.
I hear that sound that it starts to 

918
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,340
distract the shit out of me,
but that's how I run my house folks when

919
00:39:14,341 --> 00:39:19,341
I'm fucking iron fist.
Right when I'm doing a podcast will be 

920
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:19,341
no watering the plants.
God dammit.

921
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,050
I'm,
so we're talking about needy,

922
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,380
being needy,
being a comedian.

923
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,560
The worst is when people don't recognize
that and they don't change and they keep

924
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:30,570
that goofy fucking ego,
like into their thirties and forties,

925
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,980
you know,
and they're still trying to be the 

926
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:35,980
fucking man.

927
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,320
What I really hate is the,
um,

928
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,450
like,
like what I call the Rah Rah comics.

929
00:39:39,451 --> 00:39:44,280
Like,
like they have like a fake enthusiasm.

930
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,080
Yeah.
Or,

931
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,660
or a fake.
What's the worst is fake and ray.

932
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,560
Oh,
I guess one dude specifically who drives

933
00:39:52,561 --> 00:39:54,590
me crazy and I'll tell you when I don't 
want to be.

934
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,220
I mean,
yeah,

935
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:56,120
I don't want anything.
I'll tell you,

936
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:57,680
I had a guy,
uh,

937
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,210
I will even tell you where.
But uh,

938
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,310
I'll tell you afterwards,
uh,

939
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,160
that opened for me that his whole thing 
was like,

940
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,170
fucked up.
This is man.

941
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,360
And like it was just like they,
there were these contracts contrive 

942
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,721
rants about like the man and how he was 
such a fucking rebel and like he got,

943
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:15,890
you know,
on the crowd is like,

944
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:16,620
Eh,
I'm like,

945
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:17,630
you're like,
dude,

946
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,760
what you did is you just gave a stump 
speech,

947
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:20,480
like,
you know,

948
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:25,481
you're running for office up there.
But in his mind he is a brilliant 

949
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:26,350
revolutionary comic,
you know,

950
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,800
that's for me.
Like the most pain

951
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,080
once in the dude actually said this to 
the audience,

952
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:34,540
he said something stupid,
something political.

953
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,100
And then he paused and he goes,
that usually gets an applause break.

954
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,920
He actually said that.
That's great.

955
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,950
Could you imagine,
could you imagine even thinking that 

956
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:49,411
way?
Like thinking like why are you not 

957
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:49,411
giving me my claps?
I deserved claps.

958
00:40:49,411 --> 00:40:50,830
This is that.
We have to agree on this point.

959
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,480
We should all agree on this.
Like,

960
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:54,020
you know,
a pause,

961
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:57,070
breaks have to come.
You can't expect them.

962
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,380
Oh my God,
you can't be the look and forum.

963
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,130
That's gross.
Honestly,

964
00:41:01,131 --> 00:41:01,390
if it

965
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,190
ones that like I have gotten,
are never ever like,

966
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:08,020
did you think they were going to happen?
They're like,

967
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:10,780
it's always like just a natural thing,
you know,

968
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,560
and you're like,
wow,

969
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:15,640
I can't believe that's the line.
Or that's the point of view that gets an

970
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:20,641
applause break.
It's so crazy that somebody like 

971
00:41:20,641 --> 00:41:21,160
crafting them that craft and applause.

972
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,130
A friend of mine when I was coming,
when I was covered up,

973
00:41:25,131 --> 00:41:27,920
he used to say when people start 
clapping,

974
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,750
you got to pause and just hold it and 
they'll keep clapping and a lot of times

975
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,070
you'll get an applause

976
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:36,710
break when you wouldn't have gotten one 
that's holding the fuck.

977
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,000
Is that better for them because they're 
all in there together.

978
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:42,140
That's ridiculous.

979
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,860
You'll see to the uh,
uh,

980
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,080
the mugging for like when the punchlines
not that good.

981
00:41:47,081 --> 00:41:52,081
And then some,
some comics will like say the punchline 

982
00:41:52,081 --> 00:41:55,920
and then the crowd is like kind of 
laughing and then they'll give them the 

983
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:55,920
like,
uh,

984
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,780
like their cause and a smile.
Like that's where it was and see if 

985
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,841
they'll come along for it.
Or the worst is like set is over and 

986
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:06,190
you'll see somebody kind of like force,
like I'm done.

987
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,290
Like let's force how much you're going 
to respond at the end of my set.

988
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,060
And those kinds of stand there.
So the crowdfunding.

989
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,070
Have you ever seen a guy asked for a 
standing ovation?

990
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,190
It was the funniest shit ever.
I can't.

991
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,080
That's so terrible.
I've seen guys like the stage to go.

992
00:42:23,081 --> 00:42:26,020
Ladies and gentlemen last night I had a 
show wasn't even as good as this.

993
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:28,620
I got a standing ovation so I don't even
know how.

994
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,980
What the fuck is this guy doing?
He was like one of those singing 

995
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,400
comedians.
He would go up and sing songs.

996
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,740
He would pretend he was like,
this guy.

997
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,360
I like.
It wasn't even like really funny.

998
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,310
I was just like,
he could sound like those guys.

999
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,970
Oh No.
Last night I was like a silly thing to 

1000
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,680
worry about.
You know?

1001
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,380
It sounds like.
It's like,

1002
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,150
why do you care about fake enthusiasm?
You know,

1003
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:58,230
why do you care about that?
The reason why you care about that is 

1004
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:00,461
because you realize that someone's 
operating on a level that only works 

1005
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:03,500
against someone who doesn't know that 
it's a trick,

1006
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:06,470
but to everybody else who does it 
doesn't work.

1007
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,950
The only time it gets us is someone who 
really,

1008
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,380
really knows.
The trick is it's got to be real.

1009
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,740
It's got to be a real genuine thought 
that this guy has.

1010
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:19,280
It's really funny and well put together 
and then it'll get us.

1011
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,370
So it's like when we see like an 
audience laugh at something that's not 

1012
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:24,920
funny to us.
Like it's almost like insulting.

1013
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:25,450
Yeah,
it is.

1014
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,160
It's exactly what it is.
It's like,

1015
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:28,910
you fuck you trying to get me to laugh 
with that.

1016
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:29,690
Yeah.
You know,

1017
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,630
you know that it's a trick.
Like if you can sense,

1018
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:35,510
you're like,
that's what he just did was he just,

1019
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:37,760
you know,
he just waves his hands like that,

1020
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,620
you know,
you know that it wasn't like genuine.

1021
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,310
That's the thing is that you can,
you,

1022
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:43,370
when you do it long enough and you see 
it long enough,

1023
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:48,670
you can tell when it's genuine,
when it's really like somebody's point 

1024
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:48,670
of view.

1025
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:48,670
No.
Uh,

1026
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,980
one of the weirdest things about Tommy 
is Tommy is actually married to a 

1027
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,821
comedian and she's fucking really funny.
And I saw her for the first time.

1028
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:58,630
Was it like last Thursday?
What's your wife's name again?

1029
00:43:58,631 --> 00:43:59,720
Christina [inaudible].
Jetski.

1030
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,960
Yeah.
She doesn't keep Tommy [inaudible] name.

1031
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,480
Notice that.
Who's wearing the pants in the house?

1032
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,860
Huh?
Let me know.

1033
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,740
She name her last name is ridiculous.
Last name is completely absurd to try 

1034
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,740
and keep that stupid shit.

1035
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,800
She's been doing standup for like,
you know,

1036
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,080
eight years or something like you don't 
want to lose that fucking giant.

1037
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,930
Maybe that's her fucking list of them.
It's so funny.

1038
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,340
Maybe that's what's been holding her 
back.

1039
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:26,930
Isn't that amazing?

1040
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:27,990
I know,
I know.

1041
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,510
I've been to and I took,
I had a really fucking hold her down,

1042
00:44:30,511 --> 00:44:32,040
like to check to get even

1043
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,040
like a,
the do the driver's license changed and 

1044
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,040
all this because she was just like,
it takes a lot of work.

1045
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:38,620
Yeah.
It was like

1046
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,220
fucking changed.

1047
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:42,440
I want to.
Oh,

1048
00:44:42,441 --> 00:44:45,620
you bitch and no hype.
None of that shit.

1049
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,970
That's just,
that's weak.

1050
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:52,090
I know a dude who was a comic in New 
York and he did the hyphen thing and he 

1051
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,870
took her name,
last ads,

1052
00:44:53,871 --> 00:44:56,180
fucking unforgivably.
He was a comic.

1053
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,030
That's not just a comic,
but unestablished comic.

1054
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,430
I mean this is a guy who had a good 
following.

1055
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:02,690
Really?
Yes.

1056
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:07,691
You had a good following.
He had done a bunch of TV shows he had 

1057
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:08,660
done like the evening at the Improv sort
of circuit.

1058
00:45:08,661 --> 00:45:10,820
He could headline,
he would headline and clubs around town.

1059
00:45:10,821 --> 00:45:15,821
So he had like,
he had like a real reputation of 

1060
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:16,760
following and this fucking guy took his 
wife's name last.

1061
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,000
It was ridiculous.
That's the death of him,

1062
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:21,060
right?
That's the.

1063
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:23,680
Eventually she wanted to break it up 
with them and that was the death.

1064
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,990
It was even weirder still because this 
guy used to get on stage and proclaimed 

1065
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,470
himself to be a feminist.

1066
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,400
That's great.
Which is ridiculous for women.

1067
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,570
Okay.
Just like,

1068
00:45:35,571 --> 00:45:40,160
it's just as ridiculous to like be like 
all into being an American,

1069
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,360
you know,
like in America for sure is the best 

1070
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,360
country.
But guess what?

1071
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,360
Douche bag,
you know,

1072
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,490
you were born here,
you know,

1073
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,680
you didn't do anything to make this 
country's awesome.

1074
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,530
Yeah.
Well,

1075
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,980
what'd you do?
What did you do to make this the best,

1076
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:52,780
you know?
Did you,

1077
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:54,710
were you a part of the declaration of 
independence?

1078
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:55,790
Did you,
you know,

1079
00:45:55,850 --> 00:46:00,850
come on man,
you're proud of being born a certain 

1080
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:00,850
patch of dirt that's so it makes no 
sense.

1081
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,730
You have respecting the ideals and 
respecting what it,

1082
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,550
what it is to you and,
and,

1083
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:08,990
and being proud to be a part of what's 
supposed to be the civilization that,

1084
00:46:08,991 --> 00:46:13,991
that set the cost of humanity.
That's what we're supposed to be where 

1085
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:13,991
the people that moved from everywhere 
else,

1086
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:16,610
what America's supposed to be as were 
the people came from everywhere else and

1087
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:20,080
came to this one spot.
So the ideal of it should be like,

1088
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:25,300
you should,
should have some some pride in the 

1089
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,911
ideal,
but I think that somehow or another 

1090
00:46:27,911 --> 00:46:29,321
you're better because you're from this 
dirt and you've got a problem with some 

1091
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:31,190
other dudes from that dirt,
like the fuck

1092
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,000
you have no credit or blame for where 
you're born ever.

1093
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,730
Like it's absurd to think that like it's
why you can go,

1094
00:46:36,731 --> 00:46:39,250
you know what?
Like people that are born in the Congo,

1095
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:40,810
you're like,
that fucking sucks man.

1096
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:43,930
That guy did nothing to deserve being 
born in a horrible place.

1097
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:49,290
But also like you didn't do anything 
amazing to be born in fucking New York.

1098
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,140
Great,
great

1099
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,400
to have a vagina.
You didn't,

1100
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:53,960
you,
you didn't ask to be a woman.

1101
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,980
It's all by chance to be a feminist,
like to only like being like feminine 

1102
00:46:59,961 --> 00:47:04,961
values and pushing forth.
I understand that you think that you're 

1103
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:04,961
fighting against something.
I totally understand that,

1104
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:08,120
but we should all be against oppression 
for everyone,

1105
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:11,090
not just oppression for women.
It's like to concentrate on that.

1106
00:47:11,091 --> 00:47:16,091
Just as a group,
like every feminist I've ever met to a 

1107
00:47:16,091 --> 00:47:18,040
woman and I've only met two,
have been really fucking annoying habit.

1108
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,050
Probably went more than two.
I know they were horrendous.

1109
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:26,330
I had an argument with the comedy store,
some crazy lady who started insulting 

1110
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,170
me.
I tried to be like super nice to her and

1111
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,220
she is a video of it online.
She's like a performance artist slash 

1112
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,480
feminist and she like,
she fucking turned on me.

1113
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:39,481
I tried to like just talk to her.
She was asking me questions and she 

1114
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:40,900
actually interrupted the conversation 
than I was having with somebody else and

1115
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:43,960
she started talking to me and then 
somewhere along the line she was telling

1116
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:46,380
me to look in her eyes when I was 
talking to her and I just got,

1117
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,510
I got annoyed and I just started with 
happier,

1118
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,570
which is what I tend to do.

1119
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,520
It's people or Douchey there.
I think that whole like,

1120
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,850
I mean just I'm totally for like,
like I said,

1121
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:02,851
nobody being discriminated against but 
like the people who really subscribed to

1122
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,170
like when it's a woman that really 
subscribed.

1123
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,710
So I got to be a champion of women,
I find for the most part,

1124
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,740
most of the time it's women that were 
not ever like pursued like guys didn't 

1125
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:19,501
really want them and they go like,
it's never a really attractive woman 

1126
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:22,970
that men like climbing all over.
Yeah,

1127
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,960
of course.
To get to her and if she is,

1128
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:26,950
she's fucking crazy.
It's out of her mind,

1129
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,400
her mind.
It's like I always feel about the same 

1130
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,570
way I was feeling about guys like Al 
Sharpton or guys like Jesse Jackson that

1131
00:48:33,571 --> 00:48:36,570
are only involved in black and white 
issues,

1132
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,720
only involved in black people issues I'm
like fucking really,

1133
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:45,410
really meant and they're only involved.
Their only motivation fit and their only

1134
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:51,210
motivation is they love being on camera.
Being on camera is the reason why we're 

1135
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,750
going to expensive suits and driving 
beautiful cars.

1136
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,350
They have become the voice of 
discrimination.

1137
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,990
That's fucking ridiculous to have one 
person or two people and one of them.

1138
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,160
How about Al Sharpton?
He starts his whole career,

1139
00:49:05,161 --> 00:49:09,360
started out over a false rape accusation
by some crazy chick that he got behind.

1140
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:11,550
They blamed it on white people.
That's Tawana Brawley case,

1141
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:16,730
if you don't know about this.
She smeared shit on her own body and 

1142
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:16,730
claimed that she got raped and another 
store.

1143
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,150
You got to look it up.
Google,

1144
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:20,160
Tawana Brawley,
Al Sharpton.

1145
00:49:20,161 --> 00:49:25,161
It's a hilarious story.
It's like she falsely accused people of 

1146
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:25,161
rape and he,
you know,

1147
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,460
made his career out of getting in the 
public eye and you know,

1148
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:32,850
and making a big deal out of this and 
turning into this gigantic rape issue

1149
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:38,250
that guy loves when,
when any black person has something like

1150
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,500
scandalous half he loves.
Can you get to come on and be like,

1151
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:45,770
this is a travesty and he gets to talk.
It's fucking bullshit,

1152
00:49:45,771 --> 00:49:47,390
man.
It's incredible.

1153
00:49:47,391 --> 00:49:48,400
The,
there's,

1154
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:53,570
there's two guys that are at the 
forefront of any like public issue that 

1155
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,030
has to do with race and let's do a black
and white people,

1156
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:01,180
but it does not race either because if 
there's some gigantic Vietnamese and 

1157
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,370
white person issue this,
I fucking doubt you're gonna.

1158
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,170
See Jesse Jackson on TV trying to 
support these Vietnamese people.

1159
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,180
Amen.
Is that like they asked Al Sharpton one 

1160
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:11,180
time,
hey you.

1161
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:11,360
Because he came to the rescue of like 
some,

1162
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:16,390
I dunno,
he can speak out because some kid I got 

1163
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,120
kicked out of school for fighting at the
school and as a black kid,

1164
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:22,121
of course I wouldn't care.
I wouldn't show up if it wasn't a black 

1165
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:24,260
person.
So they go words,

1166
00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:25,640
will you fucking would you do?

1167
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:28,940
Would you care?
Would you show if like if it was a white

1168
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:29,510
kid,
he was like,

1169
00:50:29,511 --> 00:50:31,550
absolutely.
If they were to reach out to me,

1170
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,170
I would.
That's complete bullshit.

1171
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,720
He will.
Maybe it's not sharpton.

1172
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,960
He's so horesh.
Then he might go on just for the 

1173
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,650
opportunity to show that he's not just 
about black,

1174
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:44,320
but it's never happened,
but nobody invites them.

1175
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,790
If a white kid gets in trouble,
nobody's gonna Invite,

1176
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:47,810
I'm going to call them.
I'm going to.

1177
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,560
Next time something happens,
I'm calling and I'm going to ask him.

1178
00:50:52,561 --> 00:50:54,860
The police show up,
how do we fix that?

1179
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:59,890
How do we fix this ridiculous idea that 
black people and white people and that 

1180
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,320
like,
you know,

1181
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:05,380
there's a group of them and they're 
against a group of us and men against 

1182
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,741
women against.
I always say there's three types of 

1183
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:08,741
people in the world,
morons,

1184
00:51:08,741 --> 00:51:13,030
assholes and people you can hang out 
with and that's reality and there might 

1185
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:14,450
be some people in those people that you 
can hang out that you truly love.

1186
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,210
There's a broad spectrum and other 
people that you can just tolerate.

1187
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,800
Sure,
but that's the group.

1188
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:23,801
It's morons,
assholes and people can hang out with 

1189
00:51:23,801 --> 00:51:24,160
and sometimes you can hang out with 
assholes if you know him well enough.

1190
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,170
He grew up with them and you can.
There's a bunch of people that I grew up

1191
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:32,171
with but I still keep in touch with that
I probably would never talk to if I 

1192
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:35,861
didn't grow up with them because I used 
to do martial arts with and stuff and 

1193
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:39,550
there's a bunch of dudes that I.
I'm happy to talk to them and I'm happy 

1194
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:39,550
to run my life.
But the reality is if I met him today,

1195
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:41,510
then we wouldn't be such close friends.
I know.

1196
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:42,490
Exactly.
Yeah,

1197
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:47,530
absolutely.
But the idea that we still do this in 

1198
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:48,020
2010,
like is that going to change ever?

1199
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:52,850
We ever kind of like melt together to be
one fucking big giant Mocha race,

1200
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:58,120
you know,
the like a combination of everybody and 

1201
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,080
just drop all the nutty diversity that 
causes problems.

1202
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,750
I think in this country it's going to 
come pretty fucking close.

1203
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,640
People's love,
diversity.

1204
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:04,840
You don't get me wrong.
Like a lot of people say,

1205
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:06,020
oh,
diversity doesn't cause problems.

1206
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:07,820
Racism comes problems.
You know?

1207
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:11,050
It's actually a challenge to look at 
people and judge them not by,

1208
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:12,590
you know,
as Martin Luther King said,

1209
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,810
by the color of their skin,
by the content of the character.

1210
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:20,080
You know,
that's a challenge and that's a good 

1211
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080
thing.
And that's,

1212
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080
and I agree.
Yeah,

1213
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,080
definitely.
For me it is.

1214
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,320
I like having a bunch of different 
people,

1215
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:26,321
but I don't know if like as a race,
if we can figure out a way as a human 

1216
00:52:26,321 --> 00:52:28,790
race to not differentiate because of the
way we look.

1217
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,240
I don't know if we can.
I think it's unknown it like people's 

1218
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,760
natural instinct is to like,
and I'm adjusting well it's the judge,

1219
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:39,370
but it's also to be drawn to people like
you.

1220
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:40,700
That's just.
And it's not even,

1221
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:41,340
uh,
not to,

1222
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:42,710
not totally true because white,
a white,

1223
00:52:42,711 --> 00:52:46,910
a black guys like the fuck so many white
girls sad about that.

1224
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:51,260
But they only go for the pigs.
They know the ones they can get.

1225
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,220
Well,
listen man,

1226
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:57,430
there's a lot of black dudes out there.
Fucking a lot of white girls don't get 

1227
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,430
crazy.
No.

1228
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:57,430
Yeah,
I,

1229
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,570
I agree.
But they actually athletes like you ever

1230
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:02,270
seen like Michael Jordan,
he's always with tents everywhere.

1231
00:53:02,271 --> 00:53:02,860
He goes.
Oh,

1232
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,410
but that's not Michael Jordan in his 
car,

1233
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,140
the 10.
Oh,

1234
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,530
you know what I'm saying?
But they're all white.

1235
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:11,560
He's got a bad ass.
Like I think she's a Cuban bitch right 

1236
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:11,560
now.
She's out.

1237
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:12,980
Look at tiger woods.
Oh,

1238
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,390
hot white chicks,
you know?

1239
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:14,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

1240
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:18,470
But tiger woods a amalgamation himself.
But when you,

1241
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:19,430
when you,
when you're out,

1242
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:22,100
you usually see the brothers with like a
chick.

1243
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,330
I mean,
you know,

1244
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:25,500
I'm,
I don't go to the really good places,

1245
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:26,530
so

1246
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,540
maybe it's running really good places,
but I,

1247
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:31,290
I usually see them with fluff and 
animals,

1248
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,470
like the.
Oh,

1249
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:37,910
oh yeah.
It'll be like a chick who is driving him

1250
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:43,370
and be like,
I just got to get some shoes and like a 

1251
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:43,370
bad deal.
Yeah.

1252
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,430
Look,
I think water seeks its own level and if

1253
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:49,431
that other chick and get a good looking 
black man of fuck the shit out of her 

1254
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:49,431
every week.
And so what if he robs her every now and

1255
00:53:49,431 --> 00:53:52,560
then,
but don't even deal with that.

1256
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:57,561
But why do you think though,
like if you were to walk into like a 

1257
00:53:57,561 --> 00:53:57,990
whatever,
a room somewhere and there and it was at

1258
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
worst there were segregated when you 
wouldn't be the inclination that you 

1259
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,670
would go towards the white people.
I wish I wouldn't,

1260
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:11,040
but it depends on where I am.
Even if it's a group of people,

1261
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:12,890
like if it's a group of comedians or 
something like that.

1262
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:13,790
No,
that's,

1263
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,390
it's like a group of comedians.
It's like it's all the same.

1264
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,360
Right?
Don't you feel like that you walk into a

1265
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,170
group,
but if you don't know them,

1266
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:23,820
if you don't know anything about 
anybody.

1267
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:25,500
Yeah.
You might go towards a white guy.

1268
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,800
Black guy would walk.
It depends on how the black guys are 

1269
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,691
dressed,
dressed in suits and ties and they 

1270
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:32,691
looked like a businessman and I might go
to them,

1271
00:54:32,691 --> 00:54:37,280
you know,
but what if they all had on blue or red 

1272
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,740
caps and Bandanas and then I will go to 
the white guy,

1273
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:43,280
I'll go the biggest,
fattest white guy that stabbed behind 

1274
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,940
him real close to the door.
I try to angle myself trying to light up

1275
00:54:46,291 --> 00:54:47,440
the room,
you know,

1276
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,770
but I think like if you go in somewhere,
I mean you'll see like,

1277
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:54,771
you know,
Asians will be with Asians and Latin 

1278
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:54,771
people and that's just like,
well,

1279
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:54,830
I don't think it's also,
uh,

1280
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,840
a part of our natural inclination from 
back when we were know tribes of monkey 

1281
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:03,951
people to,
to select a group and just stay with 

1282
00:55:03,951 --> 00:55:04,380
that group and to assume that all the 
other groups are against you.

1283
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:05,220
You know,
I mean,

1284
00:55:05,221 --> 00:55:08,940
that's what we do with sports teams.
That's what we do with state pride,

1285
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:13,970
you know,
that's what we do in the north versus 

1286
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:13,970
the south.
It's really all the same thing.

1287
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:14,370
It's like it's all team shit.
You know,

1288
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:15,390
there was a,
um,

1289
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,630
there's a theory that we talked about on
here,

1290
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:23,100
on the show before that this 
anthropologist came up with,

1291
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:26,520
it's called Dunbar's number and Dunbar's
number is,

1292
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,140
it's all about the,
uh,

1293
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:33,141
the number of people that you're capable
of remembering and having stable 

1294
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:36,180
relationships with and it's like 150 
people is the most.

1295
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,790
And that's the theory.
The theories.

1296
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:38,850
Oh,
that's right or not,

1297
00:55:38,851 --> 00:55:41,250
but it's pretty close in my opinion,
knowing a lot of people,

1298
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,960
50 people sounds about right.

1299
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,550
It's like you can't have that many more 
people in your life because if you do,

1300
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:50,400
it's just too confusing and you don't 
have the capacity to remember it.

1301
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,430
It's almost like our culture has evolved
so far that it's an operating system 

1302
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:56,400
that our,
our,

1303
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,270
our hard drive isn't capable of 
processing like,

1304
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,360
well we're,
what our operating system is,

1305
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:08,540
is our operating system in our memory 
and our hardware is set up for living,

1306
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,560
you know,
in fucking,

1307
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:11,790
you know,
10,000

1308
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:16,470
BC throwing sticks with rocks,
sharp rocks at the end of it.

1309
00:56:16,471 --> 00:56:21,471
As at moving animals aren't.
Our hardware has barely evolved past 

1310
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:22,650
that.
But our,

1311
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:28,410
our culture is just fucking light.
There's 300 million of us all in this 

1312
00:56:29,111 --> 00:56:34,111
one continent and all supposed to be on 
the same team and there's so much 

1313
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:35,110
disconnection that we try to get 
connections,

1314
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,100
like little small connections.
The tribe itself is too massive,

1315
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,280
I think like thousands and thousands of 
years ago.

1316
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,210
Like,
you know,

1317
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,710
when people had,
you know,

1318
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:49,780
we were tribes of hunters and gatherers 
and we're nomadic and everything like 

1319
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:53,131
that.
Like the bond between people in those 

1320
00:56:53,131 --> 00:56:55,090
tribes must've been so fucking intense,
really so much better and more,

1321
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:56,830
more,
more cooperation,

1322
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,770
more love for each other,
more community than we have today.

1323
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,950
I mean,
if you even fucking know your neighbors 

1324
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,950
mad,
you know.

1325
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:04,950
But I think partner not,
I do not actually.

1326
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,400
This guy who lives over here is a Douche
bag.

1327
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:10,210
I know that he lets his dogs go out and 
they bite other people's dogs and then,

1328
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,830
you know,
I got this guy up the street.

1329
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:16,831
It's kind of a pain in the ass and this 
lady's weird and always asked weird 

1330
00:57:16,831 --> 00:57:19,890
questions.
It's like I barely know these fucking 

1331
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:19,890
people.
I wave to a few of them.

1332
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,660
Some of them I like to see him,
but it's not like it used to be man.

1333
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,660
He used to live.
I lived two doors down from other than 

1334
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:27,660
department.
Yeah.

1335
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:27,660
Like I live like a Jew,
you know,

1336
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,420
the people next to another names.
That's crazy.

1337
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,280
You live in it like a hotel.
Yeah,

1338
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,200
I think it's,
you know,

1339
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:34,720
part of it is that I feel like today 
it's almost like,

1340
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,000
uh,
like we,

1341
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,930
we kind of almost in a weird way 
encourage people to be selfish.

1342
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:44,350
We tell people like,
don't waste your time with that,

1343
00:57:44,351 --> 00:57:47,170
don't do this and that for so and so.
Like it's like,

1344
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,170
look out for yourself.
Shit.

1345
00:57:49,171 --> 00:57:50,230
Yeah.
But it's kind of like,

1346
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,620
it's almost like that's because there's 
too many of us don't go out of your way 

1347
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:55,620
for somebody,
man,

1348
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:56,770
that's kind of the way it's.
Our culture has evolved,

1349
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:01,900
uh,
into this weird place to deal with the 

1350
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:01,900
fact that there's so many of us.
I mean,

1351
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:02,410
that's really what it is.

1352
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,440
There's just too fucking many human 
beings in this one place.

1353
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:06,560
You know,
for,

1354
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,590
for the way we're wired,
not too many beans.

1355
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,720
I mean,
obviously it's not sustainable if we 

1356
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:13,720
keep growing at this rate,
but the rate route,

1357
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,640
like right now we can,
we have enough food if we concentrate on

1358
00:58:15,641 --> 00:58:17,140
everything and do mean we're feeding 
people,

1359
00:58:17,141 --> 00:58:18,910
you know,
we are getting it done right now,

1360
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,230
you know,
but man,

1361
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,380
it's,
we're set up for much smaller groups.

1362
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,340
That shit will hypnotize me.
You can't look at the.

1363
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,640
Sorry,
I got distracted.

1364
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:31,680
Fuck with you.
Then you won't be able to have a 

1365
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,481
conversation in the chat.
Will will blind you with its 

1366
00:58:33,481 --> 00:58:33,481
retardation.

1367
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:37,720
There's some cool people in that trap.
But there's some monsters in.

1368
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:41,260
There are some fucking monkeys.
Um,

1369
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:46,320
so anyway,
what the way we got onto this subject 

1370
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,951
was feminism and the idea that uh,
this poor fuck who changed his name was 

1371
00:58:49,951 --> 00:58:52,010
actually a male feminist.
That,

1372
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,830
that's,
that.

1373
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,180
That's.
It's so depressing.

1374
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:57,250
Sad.
He catch a woman being a woman,

1375
00:58:57,251 --> 00:58:58,530
being a,
uh,

1376
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,160
a mail list.
Is that a,

1377
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,720
is that a word?
You know,

1378
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,570
could you imagine a woman who likes 
ticks up for men's rights?

1379
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:09,870
That would be just a whore.
That's all you would think about that 

1380
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:09,870
girl,
you know,

1381
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:10,360
maybe like a girl that survives on 
loads.

1382
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:14,830
If she doesn't have them,
she doesn't live here.

1383
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,500
She's like a load vampire.
Yeah.

1384
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:17,770
GimMe a Chug,
chug,

1385
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:22,771
chug.
You imagine what a ridiculous idea that 

1386
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:22,771
a woman would be a mail list.
You

1387
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:27,050
know,
and everybody would have such a 

1388
00:59:27,050 --> 00:59:27,200
definitive a masculine.
What?

1389
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:33,100
I don't think there is even a word 
feminist is such a common part of our 

1390
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,060
vocabulary.
But the male pro male.

1391
00:59:35,061 --> 00:59:35,810
Yeah.
And he's like,

1392
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,990
it was as close as we got.
But Eddie.

1393
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:43,190
Yeah.
Eddie woman.

1394
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:46,000
That would be only into men.
You would know.

1395
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,450
Chicks would trust that fucking bitch.
No,

1396
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,130
she's doing,
you know,

1397
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,250
like standing up for men's rights and 
chicken.

1398
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,790
No checks would trust her and guys would
would just like,

1399
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:58,250
they'd be all over it,
but they would also be something like,

1400
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,660
you would be like,
something's wrong with this bitch.

1401
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,600
They would think it's a gimmick to which
I thought with him,

1402
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:05,120
with this guy who would go on stage and 
talk about onstage,

1403
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:06,590
how he's a feminist and they'll just be 
like,

1404
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:09,740
oh my God.
And just cheering like,

1405
01:00:09,741 --> 01:00:11,840
yeah,
like the broken ones,

1406
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,690
the broken ones that like to see a man 
who's fucking,

1407
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,830
who was weak and wearing a bridle and 
his mouth with marks on his ass.

1408
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:19,460
Yeah,
that's,

1409
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:20,440
you know,
that's where it.

1410
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,250
Fuck this.
A sad guy,

1411
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,950
man.
The groups,

1412
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:26,410
men,
you know,

1413
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:31,420
it's very hard to be a female comedian 
and this is where we all got started 

1414
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,950
from your wouldn't,
your wife wouldn't change her name?

1415
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,750
Yeah.
So your,

1416
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:37,730
your wife,
even though she won't change her name.

1417
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,700
Still very funny.
And how long has she been doing comedy?

1418
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,760
Yeah,
about eight years.

1419
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,910
Eight years.
So you guys were like pretty similar 

1420
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,901
timelines.
How many years have you been doing 

1421
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:49,901
though?
A.

1422
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:50,300
Yep.
What'd you meet her?

1423
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:53,600
I met her in a room doing a show.
Yeah,

1424
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,570
fuck her.
That night she ended up,

1425
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:58,940
she had a different boyfriend at the 
time.

1426
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,270
Really stole that bitch.
Well now they,

1427
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,280
they broke up,
I mean they would have anything to do 

1428
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:06,280
with them breaking out now.
Nothing,

1429
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:06,280
nothing.
I always thought she was cool,

1430
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:07,610
you know,
I thought they were cool,

1431
01:01:07,611 --> 01:01:08,900
nice.
And like I just,

1432
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:10,470
I thought I liked her,
but I was like,

1433
01:01:10,471 --> 01:01:13,580
that's just not gonna happen.
Like they were together a while,

1434
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:14,570
man,
like few years,

1435
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:15,560
you know?
How did he fuck up?

1436
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,050
I don't know.
I don't know how he fucked up.

1437
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,530
I mean I know that she left Tommy bonds 
into the picture.

1438
01:01:20,531 --> 01:01:21,410
You just fucked up.

1439
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:27,920
She just decided I guess that she wasn't
going to marry that guy.

1440
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,980
So yeah,
I came in there and I just took that 

1441
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:32,980
shit.
You just grabbed it?

1442
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,380
Yeah,
just came in.

1443
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,770
Took when she was vulnerable.
She got her on the rebound.

1444
01:01:37,210 --> 01:01:38,100
Yeah,
totally.

1445
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,430
I totally get.
How many weeks after the breakup did you

1446
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:41,970
get her?
I think it was like,

1447
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:43,250
oh,
I think like a couple of months.

1448
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:45,830
Had past couple months.
I think so she's a good person.

1449
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:50,831
She's thinking chicks get mad.
So she gets so mad when you break up 

1450
01:01:50,831 --> 01:01:52,430
with a chick and you have a new one 
right away.

1451
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,660
They get angry.
Yeah.

1452
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:54,480
Yeah.
You know,

1453
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,930
a friend of ours is going through a 
situation like that right now.

1454
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,770
You can't really talk about it.
Yeah.

1455
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,190
But his is access angry at him.
Oh yeah.

1456
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,850
I've been.
It's really high end.

1457
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:06,130
Like a motherfucker.
Yeah.

1458
01:02:06,131 --> 01:02:06,670
Yeah,
yeah.

1459
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,270
Yeah.
She,

1460
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:12,530
um,
whenever that can't be good man.

1461
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:13,370
Yeah.
You know,

1462
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:18,371
this,
the attachment that people have to each 

1463
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:18,371
other so fucking intense that when they 
break,

1464
01:02:18,371 --> 01:02:20,130
when someone breaks up with you then 
starts dating someone else

1465
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:24,150
that you feel like they stole from you.
Like they stole your happiness.

1466
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:25,170
You know?
It's like,

1467
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:27,240
where's my fucking happiness and why am 
I.

1468
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,090
Why is my happiness been replaced with 
deep sorrow and sad,

1469
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,450
devastating feeling,
man.

1470
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:36,470
Crushing Man.
There's nothing actually like separate 

1471
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:37,230
from that that makes you feel that quite
that way.

1472
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,290
I can't think of anything.
No death.

1473
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:40,660
Yeah,
that's like death.

1474
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:43,470
It's like a death.
A dog dies more than a dog dies.

1475
01:02:43,471 --> 01:02:46,800
A friend die a friend.
It's a devastating thing for people,

1476
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:51,801
man.
It's because nature has its setup that 

1477
01:02:51,801 --> 01:02:54,771
we attach to each other and that we 
become addicted to each other and then 

1478
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,040
we literally having that person in your 
life.

1479
01:02:56,041 --> 01:03:01,041
It's like your whole formula.
You're your whole like balance is.

1480
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,570
It's,
it's.

1481
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,640
It requires having that person in the 
system.

1482
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:10,970
Did you have a whole system and that 
person you go to for your love and your 

1483
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:12,720
sex and your and they like a lock into 
your grid.

1484
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,900
Now when they're gone,
it's like you have this gaping hole 

1485
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,720
where that person used to be and most 
people just try to fill that bitch up 

1486
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:20,820
real quick.
What's the next one?

1487
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:21,570
Next one?
Yeah,

1488
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,540
we got a leak.
You know,

1489
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,570
plug it up.
It's weird man,

1490
01:03:24,571 --> 01:03:29,571
but it's all set up so that we breed.
It's all these weird little biological 

1491
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:29,571
tricks.
You know,

1492
01:03:29,571 --> 01:03:32,130
like the,
the irrationality of the breakup,

1493
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:37,250
depression.
It's so intense and you can tell people 

1494
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:37,250
all day.
It doesn't matter.

1495
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,600
There's other people out there you're 
going to do by doesn't matter.

1496
01:03:39,601 --> 01:03:42,460
You can say.
You can rationalize all day and,

1497
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:45,090
and there's gonna be times when people 
make phone calls.

1498
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:47,430
They should not fucking make,
you know,

1499
01:03:47,431 --> 01:03:48,720
it's over,
but you'll have to,

1500
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:49,860
if I just call her,
let me,

1501
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:52,920
maybe I never expressed myself.
Maybe I never did it the right way.

1502
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:58,010
And then you call it and then as that 
empty feeling where you're talking to 

1503
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,010
them and they really don't want to talk 
to you.

1504
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,170
And they're like,
listen,

1505
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,390
I think I need to be by myself.
Let's see.

1506
01:04:00,391 --> 01:04:02,190
Just give me a chance.
Just try.

1507
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:02,660
No,
I'm,

1508
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,560
I am with someone right now.
And you're like,

1509
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:06,210
what?
Then there what?

1510
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,200
Uh,
and then,

1511
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:12,370
uh,
and then you hang up and then you can't 

1512
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:12,370
sleep and you're devastated.
Like what a trick,

1513
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:17,570
what a terrible trick.
And if you look back on some of the 

1514
01:04:17,570 --> 01:04:19,110
Times you've had those situations and 
how fucking happy you are that they,

1515
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:21,170
you broke up with that person.
Sure man.

1516
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,400
How many times does that happen when you
look back on?

1517
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:28,401
Like,
like when I was 21 and my girlfriend 

1518
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:28,401
broke up with me,
I was so sad for like a week.

1519
01:04:28,401 --> 01:04:29,970
Like I couldn't believe,
I thought she was going to be the one,

1520
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,500
we're going to have babies together and 
shit.

1521
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,290
But now I think back on what if I got 
stuck with her.

1522
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,730
Oh yeah.
Alright.

1523
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,400
I think about just like times where like
a without even,

1524
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:43,430
you know,
when I was like wanting to pursue 

1525
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:44,680
somebody in like maybe went out with him
a few times and it didn't work out.

1526
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:46,680
It didn't evolve and how that was like,
like,

1527
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:47,690
you know,
it's like depressing.

1528
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:48,240
You're like,
Oh,

1529
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:53,510
you've met and then you get to like,
you sort of get to know the person from 

1530
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:55,500
a distance you're like you imagined.
But ended up like if it had worked out,

1531
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:58,170
I would be miserable today.
Have you ever had an angry girlfriend?

1532
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,460
Uh,
no.

1533
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:04,520
I've got a few angry ones.
I've had a few anger ones to angry ones 

1534
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,750
are so strange because you just tolerate
like this,

1535
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,810
this yelling and this craziness in your 
life.

1536
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:14,880
Tolerate people getting pissed.
You tolerate negativity and then you 

1537
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:15,420
realize one day like you break up with 
them and you go,

1538
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:18,520
okay,
the fucking has stopped them.

1539
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,270
I feel so much better.
Like I was dating a fucking crazy person

1540
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,530
shaking your core.
Yeah.

1541
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:27,640
I was dating some fucking,
some monster,

1542
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:29,380
some,
some deficit in my life,

1543
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:29,630
you know?

1544
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:30,180
Yeah.
I,

1545
01:05:30,181 --> 01:05:30,790
I,
uh,

1546
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:33,950
I lived with somebody.
No,

1547
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:34,470
no,
not,

1548
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,390
but not a girlfriend.
Had Roommates who in one of my roommates

1549
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,610
dated a fucking monster.
And uh,

1550
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,670
when they ended it,
it was like the whole,

1551
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:45,180
like the whole apartment complex,
calm down,

1552
01:05:45,181 --> 01:05:45,940
like,
you know what I mean?

1553
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:48,790
It was supposed to be this chill.
Yeah.

1554
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:53,791
You were saying you were bringing in 
fucking devastation to this place every 

1555
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:55,960
day.
Why did you invite an earthquake in here

1556
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:57,360
every single day like that?

1557
01:05:57,550 --> 01:05:59,740
She roommates.
Do she do any,

1558
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,520
anything?
Douchey in your life?

1559
01:06:01,521 --> 01:06:06,521
You gotta you gotTa.
Figure out a way to separate yourself 

1560
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:06,521
from that.
Like that's like number one,

1561
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,460
like any shit you have to deal with.
Like if you have a fuckup job and it's a

1562
01:06:10,461 --> 01:06:13,370
bad situation,
you gotta get the fuck man.

1563
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:14,510
Just go.
Yeah.

1564
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:19,540
You can't just swallow that.
There's a reason why so many guys go 

1565
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:19,540
postal.
You know,

1566
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,780
you hear that expression postal.
I mean,

1567
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:24,080
there's a reason why that expression 
exists is because that job sucks.

1568
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:25,970
Yep.
Job's boring as fuck.

1569
01:06:25,971 --> 01:06:29,150
And you work with a bunch of assholes 
and one day you go,

1570
01:06:29,151 --> 01:06:32,180
I'm going to get a fucking gun and I'm 
going to kill every last one of you.

1571
01:06:32,181 --> 01:06:36,260
Do douchebags because they have been the
source of your pain and frustration.

1572
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:38,840
Every god Damn Dang.
He show up at work.

1573
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:43,841
There's negative tiffany there.
And not saying that the guy who shoots 

1574
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:44,410
him isn't the fucking the cause of it.
I mean a lot of times,

1575
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:47,330
but it's like to them like there's,
you know,

1576
01:06:47,331 --> 01:06:48,890
they're hard wired wrong.
So whatever,

1577
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:53,891
whatever the reason they hate it,
they get there and it's just shit 

1578
01:06:53,891 --> 01:06:54,260
everyday.
It's shit.

1579
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:59,261
And with other,
there's so many people out there that 

1580
01:06:59,261 --> 01:07:01,301
just hate everyone they have to deal 
with everyday and they haven't bosses 

1581
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:01,301
that fuck with them and,

1582
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:04,570
and the.
And you realize to men like after,

1583
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,160
you know,
when you get like a little bit older,

1584
01:07:06,161 --> 01:07:08,850
you start to figure out that like you're
in control of,

1585
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:11,440
of like your own happiness and a lot of 
ways

1586
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,730
like if you are,
but you're not.

1587
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:17,731
When you get all locked up with debt,
the thing is you get a car and you get 

1588
01:07:17,731 --> 01:07:18,500
an apartment and you know,
you know,

1589
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:20,680
you have bills you have to pay every 
fucking month.

1590
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:23,260
That's when things get tricky because 
then,

1591
01:07:23,261 --> 01:07:25,000
especially in this economy,
like what do you do?

1592
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:27,640
Do you fucking just cast yourself off 
freed?

1593
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:29,560
You quit this without having another 
job.

1594
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:30,520
What do you do?

1595
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,480
I think,
well there's like borderline,

1596
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:34,480
like you don't be a fucking,
like A.

1597
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:39,510
I'm just gonna quit everything.
But like if you're really fucking 

1598
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:42,731
miserable either at your job or in a 
relationship or even like with like with

1599
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:47,450
like a friend or whatever it is,
you can fucking make that better.

1600
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:49,940
Like you can get.
You can leave somebody,

1601
01:07:50,150 --> 01:07:51,780
you can look for another job.
I know it's,

1602
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:52,180
I'm not saying.

1603
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,980
And you get your own shit together.
You can get your shit together,

1604
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:59,981
getting your own shit together.
The only way you're ever gonna really 

1605
01:07:59,981 --> 01:07:59,981
have a fun life and a fun relationship.
Now,

1606
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:02,270
if you deal with your own personal 
bullshit,

1607
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:04,700
like you can't have a good relationship.
You got a lot of personal.

1608
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:05,270
Absolutely.

1609
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:05,900
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1610
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:07,940
Yeah.
There's no such thing as somebody with a

1611
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,120
WHO's,
who's got a bunch of fucking to their 

1612
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:13,120
own issues and has great relationships.
You know,

1613
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:14,300
like it's just,
you have to straighten your shit up,

1614
01:08:14,301 --> 01:08:16,580
but I'm just saying you can make a 
decision

1615
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:21,700
to not be miserable.
How many times do you ever get that 

1616
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:21,950
speech where people ask you like,
hey,

1617
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:24,890
how do you.
How'd you get started in comedy?

1618
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,870
If I wanted to do comedy,
how would I get started?

1619
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:30,040
And they're like 35 or $36 a month.
Do it.

1620
01:08:30,041 --> 01:08:35,041
I don't even know what to tell you.
You're going to have to live like a 

1621
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:35,041
popper.
You wonder,

1622
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:37,690
are you ready to get that hot tub time 
machine going back?

1623
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:38,600
You can't start.
I mean,

1624
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:39,560
you can.
Robert Schimmel,

1625
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:42,610
did you know she started when he was 36?
Sure.

1626
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:44,690
Fucking crazy.
I'm pretty sure.

1627
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:49,750
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure he started fairly late 

1628
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:50,060
and I.
I believe you already had a family.

1629
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,060
He did,
which is a that's.

1630
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,400
That makes it even harder.
He's hilarious.

1631
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,280
It's very funny.
I love be sick right now.

1632
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:03,730
He took again,
have some sort of a liver transplant or 

1633
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:03,730
something like that.
Now.

1634
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,000
It's very sad.
He's a great guy.

1635
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,860
Very,
very,

1636
01:09:05,861 --> 01:09:08,960
very funny guy too.
Super Fun and Super Nice Guy Too.

1637
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,360
Yeah,
I love that he can he be like,

1638
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:14,960
when you watch them,
like you're watching somebody who's it?

1639
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:17,760
It seems like it's like effortless,
like there's,

1640
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:22,450
there's really like a controlled,
like lower amount of energy where you're

1641
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:22,770
like,
yeah,

1642
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:27,980
is it this guy?
Looks like he's ordering a sandwich or 

1643
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,450
something and it's hilarious and the 
room is just fucking floating.

1644
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,520
Yeah,
he's a really good writer and really 

1645
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,150
good at his pace and setting and he's 
got his own very particular style.

1646
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:37,860
Super.
Their unique style.

1647
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:40,780
He's fantastic and a lot of his stuff is
very juvenile,

1648
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:44,620
which I respect what I'm saying.
I mean he's,

1649
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:47,850
he's got a lot of like advanced Dick 
Jokes.

1650
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,030
They're like,
but they're really good and well written

1651
01:09:51,031 --> 01:09:52,110
shit,
you know,

1652
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:54,900
he so fucking fun started late in life,
man.

1653
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:58,230
That,
that the likelihood of somebody being 36

1654
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,620
and being as good as Robert Schimmel is,
got to be,

1655
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:04,530
I don't know,
like in the,

1656
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,090
it's in the billions,
right?

1657
01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:06,760
Like that.

1658
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,360
Most of it's supposed to happen usually 
once people started on their late 

1659
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:12,360
thirties,
they just,

1660
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,470
it's too late.
I started when I was 21.

1661
01:10:14,530 --> 01:10:17,350
I started just a few weeks after my 21st
birthday.

1662
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:22,900
I turned 21 August 11th,
1988.

1663
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:28,320
And uh,
August 27th was the first time I ever 

1664
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:28,320
went on stage.
Wow,

1665
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:28,780
man,
what about you?

1666
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,450
I went,
I started,

1667
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,870
uh,
when I was 20.

1668
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,080
I just turned 23.

1669
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:34,870
Yeah,
right.

1670
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,350
That's a good time,
right,

1671
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:37,430
because you're,
you're not,

1672
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:40,190
you're not locked into any sort of 
success.

1673
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:45,580
Not like you're moving up the corporate 
ladder and you're doing pretty good and 

1674
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,931
you know you don't wanna you don't want 
to fucking sidetrack that and try to do 

1675
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:50,810
stand up and then have the standup not 
work out and then you go,

1676
01:10:50,811 --> 01:10:52,370
well,
I could have been a success here.

1677
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:57,470
Yeah.
Now I know a couple of guys that did 

1678
01:10:57,470 --> 01:10:59,391
that.
I know a couple of guys that because 

1679
01:10:59,391 --> 01:10:59,910
that's hard to give up your lifestyle if
you got like you're making good money in

1680
01:10:59,911 --> 01:11:00,780
a regular job.

1681
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:05,790
It's one of the hardest things that,
that leap that untethering from the 

1682
01:11:05,790 --> 01:11:06,670
system try to make it into show 
business,

1683
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:11,700
quote unquote.
Especially something as volatile as 

1684
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,941
standup comedy.
Especially in the beginning when you 

1685
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:13,941
really don't know what the fuck you're 
doing.

1686
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:17,840
Oh yeah.
I was lucky I was 21 and I'd,

1687
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:22,850
you know,
I had a bunch of shit going on martial 

1688
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:22,850
arts wise.
I was teaching and stuff,

1689
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,960
but I didn't really have any money,
you know?

1690
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:29,990
I mean I had a little.
I had a car that I was making payments 

1691
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:29,990
on it.
Once I started doing comedy,

1692
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,470
I didn't have any money and I got my 
car,

1693
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:33,130
got repossessed.
I had to get a car.

1694
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:33,750
Yeah,
yeah,

1695
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,160
yeah.
I went broke,

1696
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,010
but there was no,
no other way around it.

1697
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:43,011
You know,
when I think about how many times I've 

1698
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:45,351
approached,
like basically devastation is near 

1699
01:11:45,351 --> 01:11:45,351
financial devastation.

1700
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:50,570
When you can see it without close the 
bank account and you go and here's the 

1701
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,980
calendar,
how am I going to make money happen?

1702
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,490
But then like,
it's weird.

1703
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:55,530
It's like,
it's like the universe provides,

1704
01:11:55,531 --> 01:11:56,760
right?
Like right when you're like,

1705
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:57,960
well,
I don't know what's going to happen.

1706
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,110
Something will happen.
As long as you keep working on it,

1707
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:03,720
as long as you don't sit around and wait
for it to provide.

1708
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,330
As long as you keep hustling and keep 
grinding,

1709
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:07,320
you know?
Yeah.

1710
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:11,040
The universe will provide no,
and ladies and gentlemen guarantee you,

1711
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,870
you will laugh if you do not laugh at 
this.

1712
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:15,090
You are a Douche bag.
It's thrilled.

1713
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,910
COMSA girl,
you can get it on itunes.

1714
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,650
Can you get it on Amazon?
Get on Amazon,

1715
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,960
Amazon.com.
You can get it.

1716
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,390
I want to.
Tommy's shows where you at next?

1717
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,660
I met Denver this week at comedy works 
downtown.

1718
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,650
Oh,
that's the best one.

1719
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,210
That's common warts.
Downtown's the shit.

1720
01:12:30,211 --> 01:12:35,211
I love that fucking place.
Thursday through Sunday and if you're 

1721
01:12:35,211 --> 01:12:36,080
lucky it stopped snowing there.
That's true.

1722
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:38,130
It snowed in Montreal.
Saturday.

1723
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,310
Didn't really.
When we were leaving,

1724
01:12:39,330 --> 01:12:41,040
it was snowing.
She seventh,

1725
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:44,340
May 7th,
May 7th or whatever the fuck it was.

1726
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:50,120
30 something degrees out and snow and 
all morning and I hope it's not that 

1727
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:50,430
fucking cold.
I'm not ready for that.

1728
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,900
No,
I'm not going to be that bad.

1729
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:52,900
It's already May.
It's gonna.

1730
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:56,670
Probably be like sixties.
It'd be nice to the Colorado's beautiful

1731
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:57,510
in the spring.
Spring,

1732
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:58,650
summer.
It's fucking awesome.

1733
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:00,020
It's got to be great.
Well,

1734
01:13:00,021 --> 01:13:04,170
you went up to my house up there.
You know that shit was fucking sick.

1735
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:09,710
That was ridiculous.
Too bad a mountain lion ate my God damn 

1736
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:09,710
dog did it.
Really?

1737
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:09,710
And Yeah,
too bad.

1738
01:13:09,710 --> 01:13:11,040
My check doesn't have to drive in the 
fucking snow.

1739
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,010
That's part of the problem.
She hit.

1740
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,550
She hit a wall,
a tree,

1741
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:20,070
and she hit the side of a mountain 
cheese as two separate accidents,

1742
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:25,500
snowy roads drive in the snow at all.
She grew up in Texas and like after the 

1743
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:28,590
second time it was like,
I go on the road too much.

1744
01:13:28,591 --> 01:13:29,610
I'm like,
I can't leave you here.

1745
01:13:29,611 --> 01:13:30,900
You don't have to fucking drive in the 
snow.

1746
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:32,160
So ridiculous.
When the mountains,

1747
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,900
she doesn't drive.
I grew up in Boston.

1748
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:36,300
Dude.
I not only did I grow up in Boston,

1749
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:41,480
I had a newspaper route for five years.
That means that for five fucking years 

1750
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:44,130
it didn't matter how much snow was out.
I was driving.

1751
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,440
I drove every God damn day throwing the 
pot.

1752
01:13:46,441 --> 01:13:51,441
I know how to hit that slide.
Counter that to stay calm and pump the 

1753
01:13:51,781 --> 01:13:56,781
brakes.
I don't panic when my car starts 

1754
01:13:56,781 --> 01:13:56,781
sliding,
you know,

1755
01:13:56,781 --> 01:13:58,680
cause yeah.
I had to throw papers out the window and

1756
01:13:58,850 --> 01:13:59,510
you know,
I,

1757
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:02,160
I got an a ton of accidents too.
Just growing up.

1758
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:07,161
Shit,
I must've been in 10 accidents by the 

1759
01:14:07,161 --> 01:14:08,160
time I was like 21 really from snow and 
ice and snow and ice.

1760
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:13,230
Just being retarded,
isn't it amazing here in la or 

1761
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:13,230
California even

1762
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:15,400
I guess how people react to rain,
they fucking panic,

1763
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:18,010
like really lose their minds.
No idea how to drive,

1764
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,960
no idea that well,
not only that,

1765
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:24,961
it gets slippery as fuck when the rain 
first starts and people don't realize 

1766
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,411
this,
especially if you have shitty tires and 

1767
01:14:28,411 --> 01:14:29,911
shitty breaks is because the oil in the 
ground is a from driving and people's,

1768
01:14:30,181 --> 01:14:31,480
uh,
engines leaking.

1769
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,060
It never gets rinsed off.
Like it doesn't enormous city.

1770
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:39,450
It just builds up because it doesn't,
it doesn't rain here for like fucking 

1771
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:42,650
months and months and months and months 
of millions and millions of cars every 

1772
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:43,360
day going over the same spot.
Drip,

1773
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:43,930
drip,
drip,

1774
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,900
drip oil gets everywhere and as soon as 
it rains,

1775
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:52,020
the first couple of hours is dangerous 
as fuck because that shit is just like 

1776
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:52,780
ice.
It's terrible.

1777
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:54,730
Panic.
People really truly panic.

1778
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:59,910
There's so many fucking people here.
That was the number one reason why I 

1779
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,910
wanted to get out of call or get out of 
California,

1780
01:14:59,910 --> 01:15:00,640
moved to Colorado.

1781
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,370
And the reason why I moved to such a 
remote place in the mountains,

1782
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:06,670
because I think that it's not healthy to
be around this many people.

1783
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:11,940
You know,
I've seen these studies that they did 

1784
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,891
with rat population density studies 
where they increase the amount of rats 

1785
01:15:13,891 --> 01:15:15,040
in an area and they get fucking crazy 
and start biting each other.

1786
01:15:15,050 --> 01:15:20,050
Like the reason why people don't like 
each other as much as like what we 

1787
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:20,680
talked about before.
We're supposed to be in groups,

1788
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,330
small groups where you know,
everybody,

1789
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:23,250
you know,
and,

1790
01:15:23,251 --> 01:15:28,251
and we're only wired for like 150.
You get a place like la where you're 

1791
01:15:28,251 --> 01:15:30,370
dealing with $20 million people plus 
Mexicans.

1792
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,710
Nobody knows how many people there 
really are.

1793
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:38,040
You know,
like they sent me the census and I'm 

1794
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,931
like,
get the fuck out of here with this says 

1795
01:15:39,931 --> 01:15:41,851
this is a joke.
You don't how any Mexicans I know that 

1796
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:41,851
are illegal.

1797
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:42,760
I know a ton of them.
I know a bunch of dudes.

1798
01:15:42,761 --> 01:15:45,800
I know dudes that I work out with.
I know I,

1799
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:48,790
I know dudes at certain stores that I go
to,

1800
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,070
dudes that you know,
run businesses,

1801
01:15:51,071 --> 01:15:56,071
they run their own businesses,
they're all Mexicans and they know a 

1802
01:15:56,071 --> 01:15:58,831
bunch of cooks.
Guys at work at this Mexican restaurant 

1803
01:15:58,831 --> 01:15:58,831
that I go to.
That's fucking awesome.

1804
01:15:58,831 --> 01:16:00,440
They're all the illegals and they're 
never going to answer that census.

1805
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,110
We're never gonna have the right number 
on it.

1806
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:04,000
Just shut up.
You don't know.

1807
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,170
You don't know.
You know,

1808
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:07,540
there's no way to tell.
There's no way to tell this.

1809
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:12,630
Well the only one that's going to tell,
but by the time they can tell we're 

1810
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:14,950
going to be so far fucked with our loss 
of privacy.

1811
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,060
I mean,
which is coming.

1812
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:21,090
I mean that's,
that's going to be the next stage is 

1813
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:22,861
going to be some sort of a drastic 
decrease in the amount of privacy that 

1814
01:16:22,861 --> 01:16:22,861
we have.

1815
01:16:22,861 --> 01:16:26,640
The point where either it's going to be.
Because technology brings this on 

1816
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:31,770
because it's just the technology that is
created is so immense and powerful that 

1817
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:36,490
you really do have like an instant 
access to where everyone is sort of like

1818
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,280
google for your life.
You know,

1819
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:43,320
like we have with Google now,
you have an instant access to any sort 

1820
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:47,200
of question you have on anything.
You can immediately find out at least an

1821
01:16:47,201 --> 01:16:52,201
idea of what the argument is,
pro and con and then start researching 

1822
01:16:52,201 --> 01:16:56,161
into it instantly will eventually we're 
going to have something along those 

1823
01:16:56,161 --> 01:16:57,730
lines where you're going to be able to 
know how many people are here,

1824
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:59,710
who the people are,
what you know,

1825
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:02,740
like you're going to be able to google 
not even google,

1826
01:17:02,770 --> 01:17:05,260
but like someone who's not even on 
Google,

1827
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:06,820
you know,
my next door neighbor,

1828
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,890
the carpenter or whatever the fuck he 
is,

1829
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,990
you know,
I don't know anything about that gun and

1830
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,890
there's nothing about him in the news.
He's not a bad guy.

1831
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:14,230
He's not a criminal or anything like 
that.

1832
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,880
You're going to be able to know 
everything about him.

1833
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:21,910
Sure.
You gotta be able to know his birth 

1834
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,910
date.
You're going to be able to know what his

1835
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,910
childhood was like.
You might be able to,

1836
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:22,580
you know,
who knows

1837
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:25,560
and you're going to know that people 
will know everything about you.

1838
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:30,640
Yeah.
It was just the really vulnerable 

1839
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:31,941
feeling like you're going to be.
You realize that like even now things 

1840
01:17:31,941 --> 01:17:32,570
you do get tracked,
you know,

1841
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:37,590
like your credit card purchases,
you're surfing can be humble when you 

1842
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:41,481
were,
you ever use like yahoo email or 

1843
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:41,481
something like that and you,
uh,

1844
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:41,490
you like,
you,

1845
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:45,360
you have like certain keywords and your 
email and it'll show you like ads on the

1846
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:48,260
right hand side you have to do with like
the email that somebody sent you.

1847
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:52,040
What the fuck and how much more is that 
going to see?

1848
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:55,590
How much better or more invasive is that
going to be?

1849
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,090
It's going to be much more.
Yeah.

1850
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:57,710
You know what I mean?

1851
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:00,550
About last week we talked about a smart 
dust.

1852
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:05,551
It's a new technology that they've 
created these little tiny things that 

1853
01:18:05,551 --> 01:18:08,581
are literally the size of a grain of 
sand and they will have the ability to 

1854
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:10,210
transmit and receive data and they will 
have their own power supply.

1855
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:15,610
Yeah.
And HP is working on a whole project 

1856
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:15,610
right now.
Just Google if you want to.

1857
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:16,540
We were not going to talk about it 
again,

1858
01:18:16,541 --> 01:18:19,210
but if you're interested in the idea and
what it's all about,

1859
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:24,330
just google smart dust.
It's fascinating in hps involved in it 

1860
01:18:24,330 --> 01:18:27,250
and this is where they're going to put 
trillions of sensors all over the world,

1861
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:30,790
trillions of these things.
So literally they'll be able to tell you

1862
01:18:30,791 --> 01:18:32,140
like,
where cars are parked,

1863
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,880
you know,
that this house is on fire,

1864
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:35,200
there'll be a grid.
Well,

1865
01:18:35,201 --> 01:18:40,201
people will have access to information 
far beyond the reach that we have now.

1866
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,310
I already fit,
feel like it's

1867
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:43,760
pretty,
uh,

1868
01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:45,830
like um,
I don't know.

1869
01:18:45,831 --> 01:18:47,470
It's like upsetting that.
I mean,

1870
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:49,880
I think it's necessary in a way,
but it's kind of like,

1871
01:18:49,881 --> 01:18:52,700
it makes me uncomfortable that so many 
places have cameras,

1872
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:52,980
you know?

1873
01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:55,140
Yeah.
But look at how that helped,

1874
01:18:55,141 --> 01:18:56,310
you know,
that's what I'm saying.

1875
01:18:56,311 --> 01:18:58,230
I know that it's an,
it's a necessary thing,

1876
01:18:58,231 --> 01:19:03,231
but it's like,
sorry to walk away from the microphone 

1877
01:19:03,231 --> 01:19:05,451
and get my notepad,
but look at how that worked in New York 

1878
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:05,750
with that guy that tried to blow up that
car and comscore and.

1879
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,380
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1880
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:08,400
But at the same time,
you go,

1881
01:19:08,401 --> 01:19:13,401
man,
like our cameras watching me everywhere 

1882
01:19:13,401 --> 01:19:13,401
I go,
right.

1883
01:19:13,401 --> 01:19:16,070
Well that's like.
And then there's the tin foil and put 

1884
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,070
that shit on.
You say,

1885
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,070
well,
hey man,

1886
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:17,520
that guy's dead car didn't even blow up 
match.

1887
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,920
What they did was,
that's all black ops do.

1888
01:19:19,950 --> 01:19:22,890
That's all fucking cow cointelpro.
What they do is,

1889
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,570
you know Alex Jones style.
Well they do,

1890
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:28,980
but the guy that is in that van is 
working for the federal government.

1891
01:19:28,981 --> 01:19:30,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have the papers,

1892
01:19:30,481 --> 01:19:32,760
we have the documents,
he works for the government.

1893
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:35,880
He sets up a faulty bomb.
It doesn't work.

1894
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:38,210
It's not scientific.
It,

1895
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,410
it lights on fire.
They arrest him,

1896
01:19:40,411 --> 01:19:45,411
they get him,
they tell you they got him because of 

1897
01:19:45,411 --> 01:19:48,420
covert video cameras and they need to 
protect you to protect us.

1898
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:49,860
They're going to put video cameras 
everywhere,

1899
01:19:49,890 --> 01:19:51,720
ladies and gentlemen.
It's a scam.

1900
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,000
It's a lot.
It's,

1901
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:58,030
it's the new world order.
Did he really say all that about this 

1902
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:59,000
made up?
That was what he was saying.

1903
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:00,500
Yeah,
that was really good.

1904
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:03,160
So I could see his one of you to.
Yeah,

1905
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,060
that he would say,
oh,

1906
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:07,170
it's bullshit,
and you think that's nonsense.

1907
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:09,480
You think that's.
But that's how the government thinks.

1908
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:11,130
I'm not saying that they did that with 
this.

1909
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,890
I'm saying they would do that though.
I think with this guy,

1910
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,430
it's pretty documented.
This guys will retard and you know,

1911
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:20,820
he was all upset at the world and went 
to Pakistan and met with the Taliban the

1912
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:23,580
whole deal.
This guys legitimately retarded and he's

1913
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:27,120
not some sort of a plant,
but it's very possible.

1914
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:29,790
There's a lot of people that believe 
that Oklahoma City,

1915
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:34,791
that the reason why Oklahoma City was 
blown up or was allowed to be blown up 

1916
01:20:34,791 --> 01:20:37,140
was so that they could pass new,
stricter anti terrorism laws.

1917
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:38,590
Yeah.
But here's,

1918
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:41,380
here's my only problem with like point 
of views like that.

1919
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:43,510
Right.
And I mean like with all of them,

1920
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:48,570
when it's like a really something that 
big is the magnitude of the conspiracy,

1921
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,780
if it were to be true.
Yeah.

1922
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:55,030
Is,
it's too big.

1923
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:57,400
You would have to have too many people 
keeping secrets.

1924
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:01,870
People are naturally reluctant to keep 
secrets for the most part.

1925
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:05,860
When you have people have like a 
compulsion to want to share,

1926
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:08,720
especially when it's something that 
they're not supposed to share.

1927
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:13,830
That is true.
So it's like if we're talking about 

1928
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:16,441
something that big,
you have to have literally there would 

1929
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:18,700
have to be hundreds of people.
Almost homeless setting.

1930
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:19,840
Yeah.
Oklahoma City.

1931
01:21:19,841 --> 01:21:20,880
Well you know,
but

1932
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,040
just to play devil's advocate,
do you know that the FBI removed several

1933
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:26,520
and detonated bombs outside of the 
building.

1934
01:21:26,521 --> 01:21:30,120
They pulled them out of the building 
after it happened and this is.

1935
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:35,200
This was reported on the news and 
Oklahoma and that the bomb itself that 

1936
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,110
they made at a fertilizer,
that they're literally like,

1937
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:38,670
if you look at the,
the evidence,

1938
01:21:38,671 --> 01:21:43,671
like how the building was blown up.
There's no way a fertilizer bomb did 

1939
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:43,671
that kind of damage.
Not only that,

1940
01:21:43,671 --> 01:21:47,130
the building blew outward,
it didn't blow from the center down.

1941
01:21:47,131 --> 01:21:49,320
There wasn't like a big crater 
underneath the truck.

1942
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:54,740
And the idea is that there were bombs 
inside the building and at this guy who 

1943
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:56,280
blew up this bomb,
you know,

1944
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:57,420
there's this truck bomb.
Yeah,

1945
01:21:57,421 --> 01:22:02,421
he blew up a truck bomb,
but that's not responsible for all that 

1946
01:22:02,421 --> 01:22:04,881
damage.
The idea is that the damage was done by 

1947
01:22:04,881 --> 01:22:07,461
a bunch of bombs that were inside the 
building and all of them didn't go off 

1948
01:22:07,461 --> 01:22:08,310
and that's the reason why the FBI pulled
them out of the building,

1949
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:13,610
pulled a,
an unexploded ones out of the building 

1950
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:13,610
and that could get.

1951
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,000
That doesn't necessarily mean the 
government was involved with it.

1952
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:15,920
Could have been,
was that the,

1953
01:22:15,921 --> 01:22:16,530
the,
you know,

1954
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,410
that he was working with other people 
and not only did he have this fertilizer

1955
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:24,411
bomb,
but he had these other bombs in the 

1956
01:22:24,411 --> 01:22:25,911
building and maybe his fertilizer bomb 
is supposed to detonate those other 

1957
01:22:25,911 --> 01:22:28,731
bombs and blow up the whole thing.
There's a bunch of different 

1958
01:22:28,731 --> 01:22:30,741
possibilities of it,
but it's very rarely talked about and 

1959
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:30,741
the,
the footage of,

1960
01:22:30,741 --> 01:22:35,090
you know,
of all these different people that were 

1961
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:37,461
involved at these different fucking 
Muslim guys that were supposed to be 

1962
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:37,461
there that had,
you know,

1963
01:22:37,461 --> 01:22:39,300
worked for a Saddam Hussein and Iraq and
all these different,

1964
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,760
you know,
various organizations.

1965
01:22:41,761 --> 01:22:42,440
You know,
it's all,

1966
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,040
it's,
it's a tricky little story.

1967
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,270
You know,
when you start looking into it,

1968
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:45,840
you say,
well,

1969
01:22:45,870 --> 01:22:48,200
that still doesn't mean that there's 
some sort of conspiracy.

1970
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,900
Absolutely it doesn't,
but they've done shit in the past.

1971
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:57,050
And when you look at the stuff that the 
government has done that would require 

1972
01:22:57,050 --> 01:22:57,060
hundreds of people to keep their mouth 
shut.

1973
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,830
Like,
do you know about the Gulf of Tonkin?

1974
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,720
Do you know about that?
Is that the,

1975
01:23:00,721 --> 01:23:03,330
uh,
the Viet a fake?

1976
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:09,270
That moon has been proven now and this 
is something that they did to get us 

1977
01:23:09,270 --> 01:23:13,711
into the Vietnam War.
So they did that and they got away with 

1978
01:23:13,711 --> 01:23:13,711
it.
I mean,

1979
01:23:13,711 --> 01:23:14,140
we went through with the Vietnam war 
operation.

1980
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:17,140
Northwoods is another one that we've 
talked about this on the podcast before,

1981
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:20,260
but for those people who haven't heard 
this google operation,

1982
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:22,330
northwoods would operation northwoods 
is,

1983
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:27,540
was a plan that was drafted by the Joint
Chiefs of staff in 1962 and vetoed by 

1984
01:23:28,091 --> 01:23:33,091
Kennedy.
It was signed by the Joint Chiefs of 

1985
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,921
Staff.
And the plan was to attack American 

1986
01:23:34,921 --> 01:23:34,921
civilians and blame it on the Cubans.

1987
01:23:34,921 --> 01:23:39,330
So we would go to war with Cuba.
That's they were going to blow up a jet 

1988
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:42,390
that was part of the idea.
They're going to blow up a jet and pull 

1989
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:45,121
the people out of the jet and fly the 
jet and move the people to another 

1990
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:45,190
plane.
But then they were going to blow the jet

1991
01:23:45,191 --> 01:23:47,200
up and you know,
say all these people died.

1992
01:23:47,380 --> 01:23:48,130
Really?
Yeah.

1993
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:53,160
This was in 1962.
This is a plot by the joint chiefs of 

1994
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:55,741
staff did.
Not only did they say that they were 

1995
01:23:55,741 --> 01:23:57,871
going to bomb Guantanamo Bay,
they were the lob mortars on Guantanamo 

1996
01:23:57,871 --> 01:24:00,190
Bay and assume civilian or military 
casualties.

1997
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:05,340
So they were going to kill American 
military to blame it on the Cubans so 

1998
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,451
that people would get all fired up.
So it's not like they haven't done shit 

1999
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:09,451
like that before.
Yeah,

2000
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:09,451
no.
Um,

2001
01:24:09,451 --> 01:24:11,140
you started talking to them about 
conspiracies.

2002
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:15,010
The real problem is when you get into 
him and you start researching them,

2003
01:24:15,011 --> 01:24:15,700
you go,
fuck,

2004
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:17,140
look at all the shit they have done.

2005
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:17,770
Yeah,
no,

2006
01:24:17,771 --> 01:24:18,340
you're right.
And,

2007
01:24:18,341 --> 01:24:18,820
and,
and I,

2008
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:20,740
and I don't say like that.
Uh,

2009
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:24,580
I don't believe that the government or 
anybody for that matter.

2010
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,470
It doesn't have the capacity to be that 
morally corrupt or evil.

2011
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,300
My,
my just,

2012
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:35,050
my natural inclination is to be like 
when,

2013
01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:37,960
when these things start to get,
like really massive is to go,

2014
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:42,961
like how can we,
how in this day and age especially can 

2015
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:43,210
that secret be kept?

2016
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,270
Right.
That's true.

2017
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:46,910
The one one way that it's kept.
If you fall,

2018
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:51,920
put your tinfoil hat on tight.
One way it's kept is by putting out 

2019
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:55,500
information that's correct and mixing it
with a bunch of stuff that's ridiculous.

2020
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,080
You know,
and that's,

2021
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,700
that's how they processed this 
information.

2022
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:04,701
What they do is they attach all these 
legitimate ideas to something that's so 

2023
01:25:05,071 --> 01:25:10,071
outrageous that it makes the legitimate 
idea seem ridiculous because they're 

2024
01:25:10,071 --> 01:25:11,850
connected to them.
But by relationship,

2025
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:13,060
you know,
and that's,

2026
01:25:13,090 --> 01:25:16,050
that's a strategy that is well 
documented.

2027
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:16,890
You know,
it's,

2028
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:18,250
you know,
if you look at the,

2029
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:23,270
in the 19 fifties,
the CIA wrote papers about this kind of 

2030
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:23,270
stuff,
you know,

2031
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:23,940
cointelpro and the idea that,
you know,

2032
01:25:23,941 --> 01:25:25,470
you have to,
you know,

2033
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:30,180
put out dumb stories that attach 
themselves to the real store.

2034
01:25:30,181 --> 01:25:31,590
So it makes it ridiculous.
I mean,

2035
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:36,591
people have,
have actually had jobs where they're 

2036
01:25:36,591 --> 01:25:39,480
disinflation agents and their prior to 
go on blogs and websites,

2037
01:25:39,481 --> 01:25:41,010
this is going on right now.

2038
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:44,610
This is real shit.
Or they're hired to argue certain points

2039
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,980
they're hired to,
you know,

2040
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:48,570
stand up for government ideas and offer,
you know,

2041
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,010
very well thought out.
Uh,

2042
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:50,610
you know,
uh,

2043
01:25:50,611 --> 01:25:55,611
arguments and they do it under these 
anonymous assumed names and sometimes 

2044
01:25:55,611 --> 01:25:59,031
it's several people.
These are real government jobs that 

2045
01:25:59,031 --> 01:25:59,310
actually exist and it's been proven.
It's been talked about.

2046
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:03,000
We find the shit that the government has
done and it makes you go,

2047
01:26:03,020 --> 01:26:08,020
fuck,
what have they done that I don't know 

2048
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:08,020
about,
you know,

2049
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:08,210
you gotta be pretty elaborate and be 
crazy.

2050
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:09,060
Yeah,
let's see.

2051
01:26:09,061 --> 01:26:12,680
So that's where the argument of 100 
people would have to be in,

2052
01:26:12,681 --> 01:26:14,900
on the secret.
That's where it doesn't work.

2053
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,000
The reason why it doesn't work,
it's because they have been,

2054
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:22,290
you know,
there's been a lot of secrets that you 

2055
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,801
know,
were processed that we didn't find out 

2056
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:24,801
about the operation.

2057
01:26:24,801 --> 01:26:25,220
Midnight.
Climax is another one.

2058
01:26:25,221 --> 01:26:28,370
We've talked on this show about before 
and it's a the 19 fifties,

2059
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:33,371
the government ran the CIA ran brothels 
in New York and in San Francisco and 

2060
01:26:34,071 --> 01:26:39,071
they dosed people with Lsd.
They had John's would come in and they 

2061
01:26:39,071 --> 01:26:40,600
would try to get lay these poor folks 
and they would,

2062
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,640
they would blast them with acid whether 
in there trying to get their free 

2063
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:45,640
content is so crazy.
That's so far.

2064
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:50,230
They did it because they wanted to test 
the effects of LSD and they couldn't 

2065
01:26:50,230 --> 01:26:50,510
find willing patients anymore or you 
know,

2066
01:26:50,511 --> 01:26:53,510
a few people did it and you know,
they fucking dose people,

2067
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:55,370
man.
They like a little bit.

2068
01:26:55,371 --> 01:26:57,410
They're giving you like mad doses to see
what happened

2069
01:26:57,450 --> 01:27:02,450
when they did the original,
the what's the famous one where they 

2070
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:04,140
were going to see if it could be like a 
truth serum where the CIA had.

2071
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:09,141
They killed people.
They accidentally killed one of their 

2072
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:09,141
own agents.

2073
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:13,470
Yeah.
They gave him too much and he fucking 

2074
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:13,470
like they because they didn't know what 
kind of dosages.

2075
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:16,690
There's just have another little tablet 
and he fucking.

2076
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:17,440
He lost it.
He,

2077
01:27:17,740 --> 01:27:18,760
he died.
Well,

2078
01:27:18,761 --> 01:27:23,761
it makes sense that they would,
that that would be possible because if 

2079
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:23,761
you think about like,
uh,

2080
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:24,310
experiments,
you know,

2081
01:27:24,311 --> 01:27:29,311
they didn't know I,
it's not like we had like a whole 

2082
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:30,850
database on an lsd experience,
you know,

2083
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:32,470
we could pull from like,
hey,

2084
01:27:32,471 --> 01:27:35,290
don't do more than this amount or you'll
fucking blow your,

2085
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,820
your own chemistry is also different 
from the next person.

2086
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:39,340
Yeah,
like alcoholics.

2087
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:41,620
Some dudes can't drink at all.
Other dudes can,

2088
01:27:41,621 --> 01:27:43,480
you just drank and somehow or another 
they don't even get drunk.

2089
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:44,510
It's weird.
Like an old,

2090
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:47,920
like some guys just pound it to all day 
and some dudes do that with an asset.

2091
01:27:47,950 --> 01:27:51,010
There's some dudes that gobble that shit
up and take like fucking five,

2092
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:55,150
six tabs and they're fine and they seem 
to like be better than other dudes.

2093
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:58,510
They get a high dose and they'll never,
they're never the same again.

2094
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:01,090
I know a guy like that.
I know a guy like that.

2095
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:02,230
Who Was it?
What's his name?

2096
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:04,150
Uh,
I can't say what happened,

2097
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:05,080
what happened to him.
He took,

2098
01:28:05,081 --> 01:28:06,550
he took a,
he took a dose.

2099
01:28:06,551 --> 01:28:06,950
This is like,

2100
01:28:07,190 --> 01:28:09,110
you know,
uh,

2101
01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:11,180
like 15,
no,

2102
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,290
13 years,

2103
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:13,530
years ago about.
Whoa.

2104
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:14,340
And that was it.
Huh?

2105
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:15,240
That was it,
dude.

2106
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:17,250
What happened?
He,

2107
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:17,910
um,
you know,

2108
01:28:17,911 --> 01:28:22,911
he was chilling.
He was in college and just partying is 

2109
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:22,980
like doing regular,
you know,

2110
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:24,390
drinking.
And what was the effect?

2111
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,350
Uh,
he,

2112
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:26,760
he,
I think he took it like,

2113
01:28:26,761 --> 01:28:28,470
let's say like on a Friday.
Yeah.

2114
01:28:28,610 --> 01:28:29,180
And

2115
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:34,980
everything,
it seemingly wore off like the way any 

2116
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:34,980
like,
you know,

2117
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:35,800
when you drink,
do drugs with wood

2118
01:28:36,130 --> 01:28:40,270
and then he was a,
he went like the next week,

2119
01:28:40,810 --> 01:28:45,810
went into like the,
like the school and walked through the 

2120
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:47,320
cafeteria and went into the kitchen and 
started like,

2121
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:52,330
like asking the,
asking the chef to like if he could swim

2122
01:28:52,331 --> 01:28:53,320
in the water supply,

2123
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:57,340
like from the sink,
like he was like,

2124
01:28:57,341 --> 01:29:00,220
can I go into the pipes?
And they were just like,

2125
01:29:00,221 --> 01:29:00,610
Huh,

2126
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,300
what are you doing back here?
Right.

2127
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:06,080
Then I go into the pipes and swim to the
water.

2128
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,940
And they were like,
so then it was like,

2129
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,860
we need to check this kid out and then 
they should've let them try.

2130
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:13,710
Maybe could.
To this day though,

2131
01:29:13,711 --> 01:29:14,610
he's,
you know,

2132
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:16,710
he's this,
he's like,

2133
01:29:16,711 --> 01:29:18,150
he's,
he's off,

2134
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,090
like he's,
he's able to work and do things,

2135
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:24,930
but he's not the same guy that he was.
Something happened,

2136
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,870
some shit was disconnected.
What was he like before and what does he

2137
01:29:27,871 --> 01:29:28,380
like?
No,

2138
01:29:28,890 --> 01:29:31,280
um,
before he was like,

2139
01:29:32,190 --> 01:29:35,240
uh,
like I would say thoughtful,

2140
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:36,900
you know,
pretty articulate,

2141
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:41,930
reserved and now he's like quirky and a 
little more like,

2142
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:44,700
like he's like artsy,
like a kind of an artsy guy.

2143
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:47,340
Um,
but like peculiar,

2144
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:52,341
like,
like when says things that like don't 

2145
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:52,341
make sense,
you know?

2146
01:29:52,341 --> 01:29:53,120
And he's like a percentage insane.

2147
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:54,030
Like what?
Yeah,

2148
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:54,540
yeah,
yeah.

2149
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:55,870
I would say now and,
and,

2150
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:57,290
and more inclined,
like you,

2151
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:02,300
you're like,
I could see something else happening 

2152
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:02,300
where you would go,
you know what I mean?

2153
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:03,690
Like you're watching something went 
wrong.

2154
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,710
You're on the edge right now.
Like you're about,

2155
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:06,370
you know,
you could see,

2156
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:09,180
I could see you falling in the tech.
Pretty pretty simple,

2157
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:12,370
crazy thing.
The crazy thing is before that,

2158
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:13,980
there was no evidence of that at all.
Zero,

2159
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:19,040
zero.
It was totally normal as far as I knew 

2160
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:19,770
and I knew him like I wasn't good,
good friends,

2161
01:30:19,771 --> 01:30:20,880
but I knew him fairly well.

2162
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:24,400
The radical change,
radical change.

2163
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:25,360
I believe it.
Dude,

2164
01:30:25,361 --> 01:30:30,361
I believe it just because of A.
I hadn't experienced one of the last 

2165
01:30:30,361 --> 01:30:33,400
times I did dmt the last time I did dmt 
where it was a a few years ago,

2166
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:38,610
where for like two weeks after I did it 
this way I was describing it was very 

2167
01:30:39,521 --> 01:30:44,521
difficult to describe,
but I say that reality got very 

2168
01:30:44,521 --> 01:30:46,060
slippery.
It's like reality just didn't seem.

2169
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:50,140
Didn't seem like A.
I could bang on it really anymore.

2170
01:30:50,170 --> 01:30:55,170
Yeah.
It seemed like it seemed like the dmt 

2171
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:59,191
experience is so powerful and so 
incredibly beautiful and overwhelming 

2172
01:30:59,861 --> 01:31:04,861
and shocking that when you're doing it,
it seems more real than reality itself.

2173
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:08,650
It seems like you're taking a look into 
a better,

2174
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:13,030
more pure,
efficient next stage reality.

2175
01:31:13,031 --> 01:31:16,930
It's like you feel like you're taking 
this look into what's next.

2176
01:31:16,990 --> 01:31:21,990
You know,
it's like an afterlife type of 

2177
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:21,990
experience,
but that's really what it feels like and

2178
01:31:21,990 --> 01:31:24,810
then I would,
I would come back or I did come back for

2179
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:27,100
him from it and then for a couple of 
weeks this,

2180
01:31:27,101 --> 01:31:30,910
this life just didn't seem like it was 
going to hold up.

2181
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:34,900
And so it felt like all this shit that 
I'm seeing everything around me.

2182
01:31:34,901 --> 01:31:37,630
It's like I'm assuming that this is 
real.

2183
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:40,900
I'm assuming that this is hard and this 
is reality and this is life.

2184
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:46,260
But after doing the dmt experience,
like that seems so much more real than 

2185
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:46,990
reality.
So what the fuck is this?

2186
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:48,310
You know?
And then I started.

2187
01:31:48,311 --> 01:31:49,040
Yeah,
yeah.

2188
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:54,080
I,
I started getting these weird ideas 

2189
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,080
about like the structure of,
of,

2190
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:55,880
of life and you know,
the pattern of,

2191
01:31:55,881 --> 01:32:00,881
of,
of human existence and of everything 

2192
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:03,121
that's going on on the planet the same 
time that it was really like much less 

2193
01:32:03,121 --> 01:32:05,230
tangible,
much less real than I thought it was.

2194
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:08,980
And that perhaps the sleeping time when 
your brain is producing dmt,

2195
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:10,750
you know,
like when you're in heavy rem sleep,

2196
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:14,410
that might be just a,
a much more intense version of life that

2197
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:16,000
we only get,
like in small doses.

2198
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,640
And that might be real life.
And this might be the crazy dream.

2199
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,730
Sounds Banana.
Oop,

2200
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,710
I almost said it sounds fucking crazy.
And um,

2201
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:24,910
and,
and rightly so,

2202
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:26,650
but what are the alternatives?
I mean,

2203
01:32:26,651 --> 01:32:29,160
the alternative is any,
anytime you start talking about what,

2204
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:33,670
what life could be or what drugs could 
be or what hallucinations really mean,

2205
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:36,070
you open yourself up to ridicule.
Rightly so,

2206
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:37,840
because most of the time when you talk 
about the subjects,

2207
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:40,480
that sounds ridiculous,
but what is the alternative?

2208
01:32:40,481 --> 01:32:45,481
Well,
the alternative is that we're just this 

2209
01:32:45,481 --> 01:32:46,540
biological,
fleshy thing that lives for 65 years.

2210
01:32:46,541 --> 01:32:49,090
Then you fucking die and you move on and
you breed while you're here.

2211
01:32:49,091 --> 01:32:54,091
And eventually there'll be too many of 
us will blow the world up because 

2212
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:54,091
there's too many of us.
That's the alternative,

2213
01:32:54,091 --> 01:32:54,520
you know,
and that this,

2214
01:32:54,521 --> 01:32:56,520
there's nothing means anything.
And you know,

2215
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:59,710
there is no purpose for any of this,
unlike everything else in nature.

2216
01:32:59,710 --> 01:33:01,810
I mean everything else in nature is 
building something,

2217
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:03,610
supplying to something,
you know,

2218
01:33:03,611 --> 01:33:08,611
a part of an ecosystem has a very vital,
vital part in the whole process,

2219
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:14,941
the natural process of life.
Everything that we see from volcanoes 

2220
01:33:14,941 --> 01:33:18,871
and fires and predators and prey all 
seems to fit into this entire system 

2221
01:33:18,871 --> 01:33:21,050
that except for human beings,
you know,

2222
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:25,330
except for how we view our life.
But I think we're just a really advanced

2223
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:27,720
form of all that shit and that what,
what we're,

2224
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,760
we're doing here and in this life is 
setting us up somehow or another for 

2225
01:33:32,861 --> 01:33:37,861
this next stage of existence.
That's why every single culture is had 

2226
01:33:37,861 --> 01:33:41,101
this idea of heaven.
Every single culture has had this idea 

2227
01:33:41,101 --> 01:33:43,741
of a better place that you're going to 
go to somewhere where it's going to be 

2228
01:33:43,741 --> 01:33:45,910
more pure or you know,
there it'd be all love or be.

2229
01:33:46,030 --> 01:33:48,040
There's all these different various 
versions of it.

2230
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:53,070
I think it's because there's a part of 
us instinctively that understands that 

2231
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:57,811
this is a stage and that like everything
else in the universe from the big bang 

2232
01:33:57,811 --> 01:34:02,431
to the formation of stars to the 
formation of planets to life forming on 

2233
01:34:02,431 --> 01:34:06,001
planets to life evolving and getting 
more advanced that are all keeps moving 

2234
01:34:06,001 --> 01:34:06,670
on towards some new,
better,

2235
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:08,230
more improved,
you know,

2236
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:11,770
more advanced thing and that that's 
what's going to happen to us too.

2237
01:34:12,650 --> 01:34:13,520
Wait,
but does your,

2238
01:34:13,521 --> 01:34:16,220
did your,
did that last dmt experience though?

2239
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,170
Like that was last time you did it?
That was last time I did it.

2240
01:34:18,171 --> 01:34:23,171
Did it,
does your experience afterwards also 

2241
01:34:23,171 --> 01:34:23,450
kind of make you go,
well maybe I should do

2242
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:24,460
or,
or.

2243
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:25,300
No,
no,

2244
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:26,380
I think,
you know,

2245
01:34:26,410 --> 01:34:31,410
the thing,
the reason why I haven't done it since 

2246
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:31,410
then,
it's because I still,

2247
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:32,950
I still think I'm still trying to 
exactly process,

2248
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:36,370
like honestly process what happened.
Like I could do it now again,

2249
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:38,410
I might be willing to do it now again if
I had some,

2250
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:43,740
but I think it's just as important to 
try to honestly process what happened in

2251
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:49,891
the last experience,
to try to learn as much from it as you 

2252
01:34:49,891 --> 01:34:49,891
can.
You know,

2253
01:34:49,891 --> 01:34:54,600
the,
the one of the things you do experience 

2254
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:55,870
when you have any like really extreme 
psychedelic experience,

2255
01:34:56,050 --> 01:34:58,550
you,
you this complete dissolving

2256
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,980
of your ego.
Everything like you've built yourself up

2257
01:35:00,981 --> 01:35:03,380
to be everything.
You're your language,

2258
01:35:03,381 --> 01:35:05,720
the way you talk,
you know your social structure,

2259
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:10,810
how you fit in with your friends and 
your family and your dog and all that 

2260
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:10,810
stuff.
Yourself.

2261
01:35:10,810 --> 01:35:14,600
Definition all dissolves.
Everything dissolved and your definition

2262
01:35:14,601 --> 01:35:17,000
of the world of earth,
of human beings.

2263
01:35:17,060 --> 01:35:22,060
All that dissolves too and you start to 
look at things in this almost like this 

2264
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:25,750
alien perspective.
It's like I always say that like when 

2265
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:25,750
you're taking mushrooms,
it feels like,

2266
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:29,510
and even damn it feels like you're 
looking at the universe through the eyes

2267
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:34,511
of an alien of like a super advanced 
organic light form.

2268
01:35:34,581 --> 01:35:35,720
That's far,
far,

2269
01:35:35,721 --> 01:35:40,721
far evolved from where we are at this 
point in time and you get to see the 

2270
01:35:40,721 --> 01:35:43,970
whole thing objectively and clearly 
without the context of any of the things

2271
01:35:43,971 --> 01:35:47,470
you already understand and know about it
like language and accents and you know,

2272
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:52,480
jobs and all that bullshit you start,
you see it all like in some weird sort 

2273
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:52,580
of way,
but when you do that,

2274
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:53,900
the problem is a fucking.

2275
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:57,050
Especially if you have a crazy dose,
you know,

2276
01:35:57,051 --> 01:36:02,051
a crazy dmt sort of trip,
but the real problem is reassembling 

2277
01:36:02,051 --> 01:36:06,491
back into the regular world,
the real problem as the like being 

2278
01:36:06,491 --> 01:36:10,601
around like regular people in mundane 
shit and try to take it all seriously 

2279
01:36:10,601 --> 01:36:11,750
and trying to focus on all the stuff 
that you do.

2280
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:13,220
You know,
you know,

2281
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:18,250
you do have to do as I always say,
psychedelic experiences are useless if 

2282
01:36:18,591 --> 01:36:23,591
you can't bring something back.
If you don't learn something that you 

2283
01:36:23,591 --> 01:36:26,381
can apply to this world because this is 
the world where you're spending most of 

2284
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:26,381
your time,
you know?

2285
01:36:26,381 --> 01:36:26,690
Yeah,
that's true.

2286
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:28,620
Yeah,
and you're,

2287
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:30,860
your.
Most of your time is spent in the waking

2288
01:36:30,861 --> 01:36:31,700
world.
You know,

2289
01:36:31,701 --> 01:36:36,701
so if you're having these psychedelic 
trips and that's what you really enjoy 

2290
01:36:36,701 --> 01:36:36,701
it a,
it's like it's all,

2291
01:36:36,701 --> 01:36:37,730
you're all enjoying,
you know,

2292
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:42,080
these experiences and you're not,
you're not enjoying the regular world at

2293
01:36:42,081 --> 01:36:43,070
all,
you know,

2294
01:36:43,071 --> 01:36:44,690
then you're not bringing anything back 
with you.

2295
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:49,690
You can,
you can go and have these experiences 

2296
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:52,301
and bring something back with you and 
change the world around you and make it 

2297
01:36:52,301 --> 01:36:56,351
better like that is possible.
Or You could take too much and go 

2298
01:36:56,351 --> 01:36:57,540
fucking bonkers and try,
try and swim in the pipe,

2299
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:02,060
the pipes to get to the water supply.
I've never fucked with acid.

2300
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:02,960
You know,
I don't,

2301
01:37:02,961 --> 01:37:06,620
I don't think that I'm not into doing 
anything that people create.

2302
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:09,440
You know,
I did a MDM a once.

2303
01:37:09,441 --> 01:37:14,441
I did ecstasy once and I got really 
fucked up and then the next day and my 

2304
01:37:14,441 --> 01:37:17,240
brain was just useless and I think I 
learned from that experience.

2305
01:37:17,241 --> 01:37:19,490
I enjoyed the experience of being on 
ecstasy,

2306
01:37:19,491 --> 01:37:22,160
but the come down was just way too 
brutal.

2307
01:37:22,161 --> 01:37:23,960
I was like,
this is not good for you.

2308
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:29,170
I think shit like chemicals that the 
manmade stuff that doesn't exist in 

2309
01:37:29,170 --> 01:37:32,711
nature,
that lsd sort of does in Hawaiian baby 

2310
01:37:32,711 --> 01:37:33,680
would drove seeds and some.
Some other things.

2311
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:37,180
You can actually track the GHB.
Know her.

2312
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:41,000
That's fucking.
I heard that shit is a really dangerous.

2313
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:42,830
I iod,
I was in a coma.

2314
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:43,590
Really?
Yeah.

2315
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:43,910
Yeah,
yeah.

2316
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:47,750
What happened?
I took calculus so it's so dumb.

2317
01:37:47,751 --> 01:37:49,160
When I did,
I took,

2318
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:53,120
I took ecstasy and then I was having 
some drinks,

2319
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:55,070
like I probably had like four or five 
drinks,

2320
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,820
which is,
you know,

2321
01:37:55,950 --> 01:37:56,190
like

2322
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,120
liquor and then I was like,
I don't feel this ecstasy at all.

2323
01:38:01,680 --> 01:38:04,590
This guy comes to you by the way.
I'm a freshman in college,

2324
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:06,520
so 18,
19.

2325
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:08,790
So then he's like,
I got,

2326
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:13,560
he's got a gallon of Ghb in the back now
you're supposed to take a,

2327
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:16,230
like if you take,
you take like a water cap.

2328
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:18,540
That's what we did.
We would take it like this.

2329
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,120
You'd pour it into that and just that's 
it.

2330
01:38:21,121 --> 01:38:22,440
And then that's it.
Well,

2331
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:25,800
he has a milk jug so he gives it to me 
and I'm like,

2332
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,340
he was like,
here,

2333
01:38:26,341 --> 01:38:29,760
just take a swig.
Well when I look back on it,

2334
01:38:29,761 --> 01:38:32,580
I realized what I did to.
It was just like out of like not wanting

2335
01:38:32,581 --> 01:38:36,960
to be rude basically like politeness 
almost killed me is that I opened it and

2336
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:37,740
I can't,
you couldn't.

2337
01:38:37,741 --> 01:38:39,420
It's too heavy to like,
you know,

2338
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:42,510
a milk jug just as like a thin little 
cap.

2339
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:43,950
Right.
You can't fill it.

2340
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:45,390
So you're trying to like,
well how much.

2341
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,960
So I realized I went like this and I 
realized there's too much of my mouth.

2342
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,960
There's,
there's six capitals in my mouth.

2343
01:38:52,040 --> 01:38:57,040
Oh No.
So I'm not going to spit it and what 

2344
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,420
he's going to sell if I spit it out,
it's like I'm spitting $50 on the 

2345
01:38:59,420 --> 01:38:59,420
ground,
just swallow it.

2346
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:02,580
Oh my God.
And I give it back to them.

2347
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:07,640
What kind of an asshole has a fucking 
milk jug of ghb around his house in.

2348
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:12,590
And then I fucking continued drinking.
And that's one thing about Ghb is you're

2349
01:39:12,650 --> 01:39:14,640
not supposed to have any alcohol with 
it.

2350
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:17,790
Like not even a drink.
So you black out,

2351
01:39:17,791 --> 01:39:19,140
you go into a coma?
Yeah.

2352
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:22,320
Who say what do you remember?
I fucking,

2353
01:39:22,380 --> 01:39:25,740
I remember all the way up until like 
moments before blacking out,

2354
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:27,210
like I was hanging out.

2355
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:32,210
I was,
I realized that I was like fucking 

2356
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:32,210
highest shit.
Like,

2357
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:32,210
like Perma Grin,
like,

2358
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:35,520
and just like wow,
like we should hang out man,

2359
01:39:35,521 --> 01:39:38,970
like buying drinks,
like just being a fucking asshole.

2360
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:44,240
And then I remember I sat down and uh,
and then I felt like that and my sister 

2361
01:39:44,461 --> 01:39:49,461
was at this bar,
we're all at a bar and my sister was 

2362
01:39:49,461 --> 01:39:49,461
like,
he,

2363
01:39:49,461 --> 01:39:53,390
like everyone was like,
just let him sleep it off and she's the 

2364
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:53,910
one that fucking cold.
The,

2365
01:39:53,911 --> 01:39:55,770
uh,
the ambulance,

2366
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:56,700
like they had to,
you know,

2367
01:39:56,701 --> 01:39:59,310
and then I woke up with tubes and all 
kinds of shit.

2368
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:00,420
Yeah,
it sucked.

2369
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,400
It was really suck.
Don't overdose on Ghb.

2370
01:40:02,401 --> 01:40:04,740
It's not fun.
Be Rude.

2371
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:07,680
Be Roots spending.
Put It on the ground,

2372
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:09,120
man.
Yeah.

2373
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:12,240
I've never fucked with that stuff.
I've never fought with cocaine.

2374
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:15,390
Heroin.
Here's the thing too about Ghb is that,

2375
01:40:15,850 --> 01:40:17,550
and it's real natural form.

2376
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:18,870
Like when,
what it really is,

2377
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:21,150
it's like,
you know,

2378
01:40:21,151 --> 01:40:23,650
it can be regulated,
it's used as an anesthetic in,

2379
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,380
in,
in parts of Europe,

2380
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,530
but when you buy it from like street 
level people,

2381
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:33,950
it's obviously,
it's fucked with like people will spike 

2382
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:34,700
it with anything.
Even if they didn't spike it,

2383
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,270
you drank so much of it.
Oh yeah,

2384
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:37,030
yeah,
I would have been fine,

2385
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:42,700
but still he used to sell that shit at 
Gnc for bodybuilder bodybuilder cover.

2386
01:40:43,300 --> 01:40:46,010
And that was kind of the thing.
Like when you,

2387
01:40:46,210 --> 01:40:48,840
when,
when we started like I used to sample it

2388
01:40:48,841 --> 01:40:52,080
and stuff you would use,
it was under the guise of like,

2389
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:53,100
well I'm lifting weights

2390
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,730
guy,
get fucking you fucked up.

2391
01:40:57,731 --> 01:40:59,200
I'm lifting weight,
lifting weights.

2392
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:00,340
Oh,
that's hilarious.

2393
01:41:01,130 --> 01:41:06,130
Um,
I wanted to talk about a couple of 

2394
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:06,130
things that I saw on the news today just
because there's some ridiculous shit.

2395
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:07,210
Um,
speaking of,

2396
01:41:07,211 --> 01:41:09,910
uh,
of lifting weights and the University of

2397
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:10,200
North Carolina,
they,

2398
01:41:10,201 --> 01:41:12,550
they're doing a study.
Somebody put this on the Rogan Board,

2399
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:17,580
my message board batch put it up there.
They're doing this study on shooting a 

2400
01:41:19,001 --> 01:41:22,150
ultrasound into people's balls.

2401
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:24,580
What

2402
01:41:25,050 --> 01:41:27,040
to act as a,
um,

2403
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,400
a birth control,
uh,

2404
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:34,530
have a reversible birth control for men.
They are to shoot a burst of ultrasound 

2405
01:41:34,530 --> 01:41:39,360
into your ball sack and blast on your 
sperm knees so that you're,

2406
01:41:39,361 --> 01:41:41,370
you're just shooting blanks for like six
months.

2407
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:42,960
Why would,
wait?

2408
01:41:42,961 --> 01:41:45,990
What is the point of this?
He didn't want to make babies,

2409
01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:49,470
but that sounds horrifying.
Then it sounds ridiculous that you would

2410
01:41:49,471 --> 01:41:50,940
trust them.
Like you're gonna you're gonna,

2411
01:41:50,941 --> 01:41:55,941
kill my loads,
but they'll come back in six months and 

2412
01:41:55,941 --> 01:41:55,941
then what happens after those six 
months?

2413
01:41:55,941 --> 01:41:58,860
I make fucking radioactive babies.
What kind of Shit is that?

2414
01:41:58,890 --> 01:42:00,540
What one of those babies going to look 
like?

2415
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:05,600
Could you imagine if I get five and a 
half months when your shit supposed to 

2416
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:05,850
be like,
not come back yet,

2417
01:42:05,851 --> 01:42:10,851
but you shoot around it,
some chick and you make some fucking 

2418
01:42:10,851 --> 01:42:10,851
nuclear baby.

2419
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:13,560
It's going to be like the six aren't 
babies.

2420
01:42:14,300 --> 01:42:15,810
Oh my,
that's going to be Shiva.

2421
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:20,460
Literally will come out on fucking fire 
with a crazy headdress and shit.

2422
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:21,790
And then doctors will be like,
oh,

2423
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,340
you didn't know that.
I mean,

2424
01:42:23,341 --> 01:42:28,341
come on.
Think about all the autistic kids that 

2425
01:42:28,341 --> 01:42:31,011
are being created today and all the 
thoughts of like where this is coming 

2426
01:42:31,011 --> 01:42:34,221
from,
whether it's environmental or chemicals 

2427
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:34,350
or just all sorts of theories,
vaccinations,

2428
01:42:34,351 --> 01:42:36,770
people being older and having the kids 
because they're older and their.

2429
01:42:36,771 --> 01:42:41,771
Their DNA is damaged.
How about the babies that were going to 

2430
01:42:41,771 --> 01:42:42,660
have when they are shooting ultrasound 
into your fun sand?

2431
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:45,050
You have like radio waves?
Yeah.

2432
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:50,810
No you shouldn't.
I would still just pull out before four 

2433
01:42:50,810 --> 01:42:51,540
allowed.
Well,

2434
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:53,100
you know,
that's how my first daughter was born.

2435
01:42:54,580 --> 01:42:56,170
The pull out method pull out.
Yeah,

2436
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:59,170
I did a bit about it on my last special.
Totally true.

2437
01:42:59,650 --> 01:43:00,470
Pulling out.
Don't worry,

2438
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:02,530
man.
Prayaj acculate is like.

2439
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:04,690
There's little swimmers.
I do remember that.

2440
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:06,550
Boys in there,
they'll fucking.

2441
01:43:06,551 --> 01:43:09,700
They'll get the job done.
The Green Moray loads at the greenbrier.

2442
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,640
That's real.
You can make.

2443
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:15,430
You can make a baby for sure without 
coming inside and check.

2444
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,970
It's actually kind of makes you go,
mmm.

2445
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:20,000
I can't believe it didn't happen so many
times.

2446
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:21,360
Definitely.
Well,

2447
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,890
don't think it's that common.
I think it's probably pretty hard to do,

2448
01:43:23,891 --> 01:43:27,230
but it's still possible to do.
It really is.

2449
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:28,420
Yeah.
Green Berets.

2450
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:33,790
They really like.
And how many times she like squeezing 

2451
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,881
that.
Were you hoping nuns coming out a 

2452
01:43:35,881 --> 01:43:35,881
little.
A few guys went up,

2453
01:43:35,881 --> 01:43:37,090
popped out.
That's like a tiny town.

2454
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:42,120
Oh yeah,
like a little like a flax when he goes 

2455
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:42,120
like,
I don't really just a little bit snug.

2456
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:47,100
Feel a little.
Just a twitch and you're trying to hold 

2457
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:47,100
it in there.
Yeah,

2458
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:47,100
yeah,
yeah.

2459
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,690
Well they're trying to come up with all 
sorts of different ways and you know 

2460
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:54,840
with women it's all they can either 
shoot you up with something that makes 

2461
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:58,751
your body think it's pregnant or they 
give you a pill that makes your body 

2462
01:43:58,751 --> 01:43:59,030
think it's pregnant or they put a 
catcher's Mitt in there,

2463
01:43:59,031 --> 01:44:04,031
like put an Iud that shit in your snatch
and it gets all infected and your loads 

2464
01:44:04,311 --> 01:44:07,420
are trying to show that.
It makes me barnacles on a fucking dark.

2465
01:44:08,240 --> 01:44:13,240
Yeah.
The thought of that one that makes me 

2466
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,851
uncomfortable.
If they pull it out and there's all 

2467
01:44:15,851 --> 01:44:17,651
these stalagmites from your old loads 
that have been trying to get into this 

2468
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:22,390
iud and they just hang out there,
it's all crusty with your old loads and 

2469
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:24,710
maybe your old loads die inside our box 
and that's why it starts to stink.

2470
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:26,660
You imagine like you didn't want to get 
her pregnant,

2471
01:44:26,661 --> 01:44:27,710
like maybe you should take that out,
honey,

2472
01:44:27,990 --> 01:44:32,990
I don't want to get pregnant as well.
You don't know how to get extra douche 

2473
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:36,870
up there to to kill your loads and score
them out because your body's not 

2474
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:37,410
absorbing them.
So she's just walking around matching.

2475
01:44:37,990 --> 01:44:40,240
I'm reading it now.
There's an.

2476
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:41,830
Oh,
speaking of like gross.

2477
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:44,440
Have you heard about that movie?
Which one?

2478
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:48,310
The one that's supposed to be like.
It's like a a guy.

2479
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:49,750
It's like the Senate,
the human centipede.

2480
01:44:49,751 --> 01:44:52,060
I think it's called.
I've heard about it online,

2481
01:44:52,061 --> 01:44:53,710
but I didn't look at it.
I haven't seen.

2482
01:44:53,770 --> 01:44:57,610
Obviously everybody's been talking about
the human centipede and I got a bunch of

2483
01:44:57,611 --> 01:44:58,720
twitter things like,
oh,

2484
01:44:58,721 --> 01:44:59,920
check this out.
Human Centipede.

2485
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:02,840
But I.
It looked so ridiculous.

2486
01:45:02,841 --> 01:45:04,160
I didn't even want to try it.
Really,

2487
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:05,210
really want to look at it.

2488
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,650
Did you see what just happened there?
Yeah.

2489
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:10,370
How far away is this image from our 
voice?

2490
01:45:10,640 --> 01:45:12,590
Like look how long it takes.
Yeah.

2491
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:14,810
It's like this is like a ten second 
delay.

2492
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:18,200
I think we're gonna have to try 
something else other than ustream.

2493
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:21,470
I'm going to have to try some other 
service people say live stream is really

2494
01:45:21,471 --> 01:45:23,780
good or that's not really live right 
there.

2495
01:45:23,781 --> 01:45:26,750
This is what we're projecting.
This is what we're saying.

2496
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:27,860
Like,
look how long it takes.

2497
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,950
Watch three.
Bam.

2498
01:45:31,270 --> 01:45:33,140
Let's get a count on this.
Alright.

2499
01:45:33,290 --> 01:45:33,950
Okay.
Ready?

2500
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,720
I'm going to point to the camera and 
then I'm gonna Count One,

2501
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:40,580
two,
three,

2502
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:45,820
four.
About five seconds is about a five or 

2503
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:46,310
six second.
Delay it.

2504
01:45:46,580 --> 01:45:51,580
Say they said it's fine for them.
Maybe it's just whack ass gay 

2505
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:55,211
connection.
Human or we love this and see what 

2506
01:45:55,211 --> 01:45:55,211
happens.
See if it works better.

2507
01:45:55,211 --> 01:45:56,150
I don't want to see the human centipede 
man.

2508
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:59,990
I hear and I'm sure it's fucked up.
I'm sure.

2509
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,900
I'm sure it's good and now we're like on
like a couple seconds.

2510
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:03,650
Wait,
why?

2511
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:05,460
Why,
why the why don't you want everything,

2512
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:07,010
man,
I've seen too much.

2513
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,250
I'm distracting myself.
I've seen it too much.

2514
01:46:10,251 --> 01:46:13,280
Somebody sent me some videos,
some Russian skinheads cutting.

2515
01:46:13,281 --> 01:46:14,360
This dude's head off.
Oh No,

2516
01:46:14,361 --> 01:46:15,350
I don't.
I don't like this shit,

2517
01:46:15,351 --> 01:46:20,351
man.
I started watching him for the first 

2518
01:46:20,351 --> 01:46:20,351
couple of seconds when I stopped it.
I said,

2519
01:46:20,351 --> 01:46:21,040
I do not need to see another dude 
getting his fucking head cut.

2520
01:46:21,090 --> 01:46:23,030
It doesn't need to be in your fucking 
reserves.

2521
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:25,010
It's a waste.
I know it's out there.

2522
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:30,070
I've already.
I've already applied that data to my 

2523
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:33,671
view of the world.
I don't have to see more and more 

2524
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:36,311
evidence of it.
I know that there are some extreme 

2525
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:39,581
examples of fucked up shit out there,
especially going online and just go 

2526
01:46:39,581 --> 01:46:41,600
online changes your whole fucking view 
of the world.

2527
01:46:41,650 --> 01:46:46,650
Yeah.
People who don't go online to imagine 

2528
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:48,881
how dumb are parents were much less.
They knew about the big picture about 

2529
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,520
what's possible.

2530
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,220
What's why.
If you.

2531
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:59,260
If you try to tell them like a lot of 
times it doesn't even have to be 

2532
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:02,140
something too outrageous.
Obama would.

2533
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:07,160
A Bama said he was talking about fucking
ipods and x boxes and IPADS and Xbox,

2534
01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:14,490
none of which I know how to use.
I hate all that.

2535
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:15,720
First of all,
I hate all that,

2536
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,550
none of which I know how to use what he 
was saying,

2537
01:47:17,551 --> 01:47:22,551
that these things provide information,
there's too much information and it's 

2538
01:47:22,551 --> 01:47:25,020
difficult to discern what's factual and 
what's not and that crazy ideas can gain

2539
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:30,021
traction and become problematic and he 
were saying that it's actually makes it 

2540
01:47:30,021 --> 01:47:31,350
hard on democracy,
which I thought was hilarious.

2541
01:47:31,550 --> 01:47:36,550
Makes it hard to run the country and 
it's bad for the country somehow or 

2542
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:39,281
another,
and that line just appeals to like a 

2543
01:47:39,281 --> 01:47:39,390
certain generation when they,
when none of which I know how to use.

2544
01:47:39,390 --> 01:47:40,620
This is what he says.
He says,

2545
01:47:40,621 --> 01:47:43,840
you know,
Ipos and xboxes and playstations,

2546
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,920
none of which I know how to use.
My fucking two year old daughter knows 

2547
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:49,110
how to use an ipod.
Dude,

2548
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,990
she knows how to find the song.
She likes to click on it.

2549
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:57,080
She knows how to go to the little apps 
and pick a little monkey game and play 

2550
01:47:57,080 --> 01:47:58,110
the monkey game.
Do you know how to use a fucking ipod?

2551
01:47:58,190 --> 01:47:59,310
You know,
don't be stupid.

2552
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:02,250
That's dumb.
And don't brag about about being stupid.

2553
01:48:03,450 --> 01:48:08,450
Goddamn Harvard graduate and you're the 
president of the fucking United States 

2554
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:12,140
of America.
Don't give us all that our shucks 

2555
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:12,140
bullshit.
No,

2556
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:15,020
there's going to be a bunch of retards 
that always don't like you or think 

2557
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:15,020
you're an elitist.
Alright,

2558
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:16,320
you gotta.
Accept that and just be yourself.

2559
01:48:16,321 --> 01:48:18,540
All right?
Don't fucking pretend you don't know how

2560
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,100
to work an Ipod,
man.

2561
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:21,380
Just stop.
I know.

2562
01:48:21,381 --> 01:48:22,980
It's stupid.
That's gross.

2563
01:48:23,070 --> 01:48:24,810
I agree.
It's fucking dumb,

2564
01:48:24,811 --> 01:48:25,630
man.
You know,

2565
01:48:25,631 --> 01:48:28,290
like the whole,
it's like he's putting on an act.

2566
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:30,870
It's like he's like a comic that we were
talking about earlier.

2567
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:32,970
We're talking about comics that are 
disingenuous.

2568
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,360
That's what he's doing.
It's a phone.

2569
01:48:34,361 --> 01:48:35,130
Anything.
Yeah.

2570
01:48:35,131 --> 01:48:36,280
So anyway,
he's,

2571
01:48:36,281 --> 01:48:39,180
he's trying to say that um,
that somehow or another,

2572
01:48:39,210 --> 01:48:41,400
all this access to information that 
people have.

2573
01:48:41,401 --> 01:48:46,401
Now the,
the problem is that these crazy ideas 

2574
01:48:46,401 --> 01:48:49,230
can gain traction and then it become a,
becomes more of a distraction than it is

2575
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:53,580
a useless a source of information.
But that's ridiculous.

2576
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:56,550
So who's the use,
who's the useful source of information?

2577
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:59,370
How come there's so much shit that's in 
the news that we don't hear about?

2578
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:04,450
How about how can we have to go online 
to find out what's happened in Liberia 

2579
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:06,960
to get real information about the 
fucking oil spill in the Gulf?

2580
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:12,020
You know,
you're not getting that shit from the 

2581
01:49:12,020 --> 01:49:13,401
network news.
You're not getting that shit from the 

2582
01:49:13,401 --> 01:49:15,201
newspapers.
You've got to really see the images and 

2583
01:49:15,201 --> 01:49:15,390
the videos online.
There's a video online right now.

2584
01:49:15,391 --> 01:49:19,950
This guy flew a plane over the Gulf oil 
spill and videotaped the whole thing and

2585
01:49:19,951 --> 01:49:22,410
put it up and showed how massive it is 
and how they're being.

2586
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,540
They're not being honest about what a 
catastrophe it is.

2587
01:49:24,930 --> 01:49:27,300
It's fucking shocking.
It's on my twitter.

2588
01:49:27,301 --> 01:49:31,230
Even go to my twitter feed,
go to Joe Rogan on twitter and just just

2589
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,250
my name.
It's not.net

2590
01:49:32,251 --> 01:49:33,060
anymore,
it's just my name.

2591
01:49:33,061 --> 01:49:35,310
I got that back.
So if you go to my twitter feed,

2592
01:49:35,311 --> 01:49:37,230
it's like one or two twitters ago.
I put it,

2593
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,160
watch that video and freak the fuck out 
because it's.

2594
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:46,161
It's horrifying looking at this gigantic
fucking thing of oil in the middle of 

2595
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:46,740
the ocean.

2596
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,940
You're not hearing about that from the 
news.

2597
01:49:48,941 --> 01:49:49,290
They,
they're,

2598
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:50,980
they're recognizing that it's a big 
deal,

2599
01:49:50,981 --> 01:49:55,981
but they're not showing you 10 minutes 
of footage so you can really get a good 

2600
01:49:55,981 --> 01:49:55,981
idea of it.
You got to look online.

2601
01:49:55,981 --> 01:49:56,760
Yeah,
you got.

2602
01:49:56,770 --> 01:50:01,770
I mean to to find out like shit,
like operation northwoods or any of 

2603
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:01,990
these other things I'm talking about.
This is,

2604
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:04,000
this isn't getting disgusted in the 
newspaper.

2605
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:09,150
This doesn't get discussed in the news.
People are hiding this kind of 

2606
01:50:09,150 --> 01:50:12,571
information.
Big gigantic corporations controlled 

2607
01:50:12,571 --> 01:50:13,270
network news.
They controlled the newspapers,

2608
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:18,420
they control g controls.
NBC and Fox News is owned by Rupert 

2609
01:50:18,610 --> 01:50:20,740
Murdoch and you know,
and they seize Disney and yeah,

2610
01:50:20,741 --> 01:50:22,930
I mean these are giant fucking 
corporations.

2611
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:28,080
They don't give you all the news.
You need the idea that these bloggers 

2612
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,380
and these people that are like,
they're,

2613
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:32,740
they're not less less informative.

2614
01:50:32,740 --> 01:50:35,080
They're not like,
like less reliable.

2615
01:50:35,081 --> 01:50:40,081
There are people that easily.
Could it be working for NBC or CBS or 

2616
01:50:40,081 --> 01:50:43,141
ABC to their fucking journalists.
They're just a new version of 

2617
01:50:43,141 --> 01:50:43,540
journalists that does shit online and 
yeah,

2618
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:44,980
there's some people that are 
irreparable,

2619
01:50:44,981 --> 01:50:47,410
but then the reputation is that they 
suck.

2620
01:50:47,590 --> 01:50:47,970
You know,
when,

2621
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:48,780
when someone,
uh,

2622
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:50,260
online,
you know,

2623
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,140
when it's been proven by a bunch of 
different websites and this guy puts out

2624
01:50:53,141 --> 01:50:55,780
bad information or then they become 
discredited.

2625
01:50:55,900 --> 01:51:00,900
I mean it's like a natural process for 
Obama and saying that that's not the 

2626
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:04,090
case and that there's something bad 
about all this new access to information

2627
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:05,860
that just shows me two things.
One,

2628
01:51:05,861 --> 01:51:10,861
he's full of Shit and two,
they're dealing with a lot of pressure 

2629
01:51:10,861 --> 01:51:13,550
there.
They're getting jacked left and right 

2630
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:15,241
about all sorts of things.
There's these like a video out right 

2631
01:51:15,241 --> 01:51:18,091
now,
have him on the campaign trail talking 

2632
01:51:18,091 --> 01:51:18,850
about no bid contracts for like 
Halliburton and shit like that.

2633
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:22,630
He just fucking gave Halliburton some 
giant $500,

2634
01:51:22,631 --> 01:51:24,470
million dollar,
no bid contracts.

2635
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:28,600
His whole fucking platform was that he 
was going to end no bid contracts.

2636
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,560
Yep.
And it just doesn't,

2637
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:30,790
does it?
I mean,

2638
01:51:30,791 --> 01:51:32,950
he's a,
he's no more lobbyists.

2639
01:51:32,951 --> 01:51:35,140
We only hires a bunch of them.
I mean,

2640
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:40,160
the,
the whole idea behind being a president 

2641
01:51:40,160 --> 01:51:44,490
is that you're supposed to be some sort 
of a leader and what you promise us is 

2642
01:51:44,490 --> 01:51:45,910
supposed supposed to be something that 
you're gonna,

2643
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:48,400
you're gonna when you get an office,
you're going to change shit.

2644
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:51,040
You're going to make it better,
but no one does.

2645
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:53,440
Nobody does.
It's the craziest hustle ever,

2646
01:51:53,470 --> 01:51:58,470
but the.
The thing that I think nobody ever 

2647
01:51:58,470 --> 01:51:58,470
admits is that neither side ever does 
ever like ever,

2648
01:51:58,470 --> 01:52:03,220
right?
The Republicans good get criticized by 

2649
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:03,220
the Democrats when they do certain 
things,

2650
01:52:03,220 --> 01:52:04,410
but once the Democrats get in office 
like the,

2651
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:09,220
there's not nearly as many people 
criticizing Obama for sending 30,000

2652
01:52:09,221 --> 01:52:12,100
troops over to Afghanistan after winning
the Nobel prize.

2653
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:14,620
Not nearly as many as were criticizing 
George Bush.

2654
01:52:14,650 --> 01:52:16,660
Of course not nailing,
you know,

2655
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:20,560
they're all just spokesperson because 
both sides are completely full of shit.

2656
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:26,160
Do you think that they're full of shit 
or do you think they say whatever the 

2657
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:29,431
fuck they have to say to get the job and
then once they get the job they realize 

2658
01:52:29,431 --> 01:52:30,400
that they don't have a.
They don't have a say.

2659
01:52:30,610 --> 01:52:35,610
They don't,
they're not the ones who get to dictate 

2660
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:35,610
policy.
Well,

2661
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:36,500
it's that and it's also that the game 
itself of,

2662
01:52:36,640 --> 01:52:39,520
of politics is so already dictated for 
you.

2663
01:52:39,521 --> 01:52:43,600
Like you,
we have this idea that like we can elect

2664
01:52:43,601 --> 01:52:45,250
somebody like,
especially like Obama,

2665
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:46,130
like it's going to change

2666
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:46,760
things.
It's gonna,

2667
01:52:47,030 --> 01:52:49,130
it's gonna actually the system will 
change,

2668
01:52:49,131 --> 01:52:53,270
like he's going to be a certain way and 
no more like spinning stuff,

2669
01:52:53,271 --> 01:52:55,670
but you realize that it's already laid 
out.

2670
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:58,430
There is,
there's a spin thing in effect job,

2671
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:01,430
it's a job and so it's like being a 
like.

2672
01:53:01,431 --> 01:53:04,550
It's really just like being a 
prospective professional spokesperson.

2673
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:09,640
It is and there's going to be 
distortions of truth and manipulations 

2674
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:11,460
and lies no matter who gets it.
It's,

2675
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:13,580
it's too big of a thing and there's 
just.

2676
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:18,740
There's too much.
Too many people that you would have to 

2677
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:18,740
try to please.
It'd be impossible.

2678
01:53:18,740 --> 01:53:20,120
So it's just,
it's the way it is.

2679
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:23,390
People are going to lie and no matter 
who is in the office,

2680
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,020
it doesn't matter

2681
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:25,610
who were the real problem is the 
corporate.

2682
01:53:25,611 --> 01:53:27,680
If you ever seen like movies on 
corporations,

2683
01:53:28,550 --> 01:53:31,730
especially the document,
the documentary of the corporation where

2684
01:53:31,731 --> 01:53:36,731
they talk about like a corporation as 
like associate sociopath or they don't 

2685
01:53:36,731 --> 01:53:40,091
worry at all about their.
It's really interesting because they 

2686
01:53:40,091 --> 01:53:42,880
basically concentrate on what the,
what sociopaths do is very similar to 

2687
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:45,170
what corporations do.
They don't worry about who their actions

2688
01:53:45,171 --> 01:53:50,171
hurt.
And that being in a corporation is sort 

2689
01:53:50,171 --> 01:53:52,871
of like,
there's a diffusion of responsibility 

2690
01:53:52,871 --> 01:53:52,871
because there's so many other people 
that are doing the same thing.

2691
01:53:52,871 --> 01:53:57,190
You know?
And I wonder like when when you get a 

2692
01:53:57,190 --> 01:53:59,381
guy like Obama,
I wonder if they start out with the 

2693
01:53:59,381 --> 01:54:02,771
right intentions and they start out 
really thinking that they're going to 

2694
01:54:02,771 --> 01:54:03,500
make a change,
but once they get an office,

2695
01:54:03,530 --> 01:54:08,530
you know,
once they get in there maybe then it's 

2696
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:08,530
like they realize like,
you know,

2697
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:09,290
like you don't,
you don't get to change shit,

2698
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:09,860
you know,
you don't,

2699
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:14,890
you really,
that's what they changed a few social 

2700
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:14,890
things.

2701
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:17,030
It changed like the gay marriage thing,
like they're getting rid of don't ask,

2702
01:54:17,031 --> 01:54:17,690
don't tell.
Right?

2703
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:22,691
So you're,
you're going to be able to say that 

2704
01:54:22,691 --> 01:54:22,691
you're gay,
you know,

2705
01:54:22,691 --> 01:54:22,910
and he's also like the medical marijuana
thing,

2706
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:24,620
they said that they're not going to go 
after,

2707
01:54:24,621 --> 01:54:29,621
they're only going to go after the dea 
will only go after medical marijuana 

2708
01:54:29,621 --> 01:54:31,340
dispensaries that violate both state and
federal law.

2709
01:54:31,610 --> 01:54:33,820
So the federal law is all marijuana is 
illegal,

2710
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:38,830
the state law is very clearly defined 
what you're allowed to do medically and 

2711
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:42,370
a lot of people don't operate within 
those parameters and they sell a bunch 

2712
01:54:42,370 --> 01:54:42,920
of shit to people that don't have 
licenses.

2713
01:54:43,160 --> 01:54:45,140
So the idea was they're going to go 
after those people,

2714
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:46,730
you know?
Yeah.

2715
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,530
There's a few things that do change,
right?

2716
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:49,270
But uh,
but it's,

2717
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:50,720
it's,
that's what they hang their hat on.

2718
01:54:50,900 --> 01:54:55,900
What are those things that do change?
Are they because they have to give 

2719
01:54:55,900 --> 01:54:58,870
something other than otherwise people 
will fucking just rage up,

2720
01:54:59,140 --> 01:55:04,140
you know,
do they like give you a little just to 

2721
01:55:04,140 --> 01:55:06,001
keep democracy in tact and just resist 
the change as much as possible resists 

2722
01:55:06,071 --> 01:55:08,560
giving the people what they want as much
as possible.

2723
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:10,180
Is it consciously thought out?

2724
01:55:11,070 --> 01:55:16,070
I think,
I think the way that the system is set 

2725
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:17,100
up is that this is what bothers me the 
most about politics,

2726
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:22,340
is for some reason you're not allowed to
admit fault in politics.

2727
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:26,730
You can't be like,
I did something.

2728
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:32,570
This didn't work out like that.
That's the system that set up and that 

2729
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:33,590
part,
that part is like,

2730
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:35,940
it is thought out.
Whatever decision you made,

2731
01:55:36,570 --> 01:55:39,000
we're going to make it look like it was 
the right decision.

2732
01:55:40,080 --> 01:55:43,640
That's the mistake.
That's the major flaw in,

2733
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:47,550
in like the political public system.
You can't admit to any floor,

2734
01:55:47,650 --> 01:55:48,570
never,
never.

2735
01:55:48,620 --> 01:55:53,620
If you do,
you're going to lose traction and you 

2736
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:53,620
and you become a flip flopper or 
whatever.

2737
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:57,880
So it's always like what I did was the 
right thing and that is meticulous.

2738
01:55:58,011 --> 01:55:59,510
Obviously.
It's methodical.

2739
01:55:59,511 --> 01:56:00,050
It's,
it's,

2740
01:56:00,110 --> 01:56:01,550
it's,
it's very well,

2741
01:56:01,580 --> 01:56:02,140
it's,
you know,

2742
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:04,010
it's,
it's outlined.

2743
01:56:04,011 --> 01:56:09,011
It's,
it's fucking the most depressing thing 

2744
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:09,011
about it.

2745
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:09,011
Oh,
it is.

2746
01:56:09,011 --> 01:56:11,070
The most depressing thing about politics
is that politics are real,

2747
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,270
you know,
and that you can,

2748
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:15,480
you could lose your fucking life paying 
attention to it.

2749
01:56:15,850 --> 01:56:20,850
You know,
if you start talking like there's some 

2750
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:20,850
new Supreme Court justice nominee that 
Obama likes,

2751
01:56:20,850 --> 01:56:25,671
it looks like a lesbian and everybody's 
all bummed out about it and there's all 

2752
01:56:25,671 --> 01:56:29,271
this debate and my God damn,
do I really have to fucking think about 

2753
01:56:29,271 --> 01:56:29,271
this?
Do I really have to?

2754
01:56:29,271 --> 01:56:30,810
When you do,
supposedly if you're a good citizen,

2755
01:56:30,850 --> 01:56:33,900
you're supposed to pay attention because
lives could change and you know,

2756
01:56:33,901 --> 01:56:37,440
you could be in a situation where one of
her rulings directly affects you.

2757
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:39,360
You know?
I Dunno man.

2758
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:41,820
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

2759
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:46,930
We're doing that.
Tommy was born to tell you about Brian 

2760
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:46,930
Jacques.

2761
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:46,930
Oh,
let's.

2762
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:50,800
Do you have a story you want to do that?
You went to high school or college?

2763
01:56:50,801 --> 01:56:51,140
College.

2764
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:54,050
I went to college with in one night,
like a Saturday night.

2765
01:56:54,440 --> 01:56:56,660
I went to A.
I was not in a fraternity,

2766
01:56:56,661 --> 01:56:59,240
but I went to a party than a fraternity.
Had A,

2767
01:56:59,241 --> 01:57:02,930
I think it was the Pi Kap fraternity,
and then as I left,

2768
01:57:03,260 --> 01:57:07,070
there is a,
another fraternity next door.

2769
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,690
They had like their fraternity house.
Right?

2770
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:11,780
And I'm walking back and this fucking 
guy,

2771
01:57:12,050 --> 01:57:17,050
Brian Jack was his name,
he beat up like physically pummeled 

2772
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:24,020
seven guys and like full fucking Ninja 
Rambo style,

2773
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:29,120
like where it wasn't even like he 
literally punched the guy and then did 

2774
01:57:29,751 --> 01:57:32,690
like a roundhouse kick and then rolled,
did like a fucking,

2775
01:57:32,691 --> 01:57:35,730
like a somersault and like rolled up and
punched another guy and,

2776
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:37,950
and just destroyed it were like,
it was like a video game.

2777
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:39,770
You're like,
oh my God,

2778
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:40,660
Oh my God.
Like,

2779
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:43,730
just freaking out watching this guy.
Just why did he get in a fight?

2780
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:44,810
What happened?
He was,

2781
01:57:44,811 --> 01:57:48,980
he's a total fucking,
like he was a very independent,

2782
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:54,040
like sort of a loner,
like a super athlete.

2783
01:57:54,770 --> 01:57:58,170
Like had that quality of like,
like the,

2784
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:03,210
like the best athletes do where it's 
like unbelievable work ethic when it 

2785
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:07,751
comes to like,
like his working out and training and 

2786
01:58:07,751 --> 01:58:11,150
like just kind of a very peculiar 
independent dude.

2787
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:12,800
And uh,
you know,

2788
01:58:13,890 --> 01:58:18,890
didn't,
I mean kind of kept to herself but also 

2789
01:58:18,890 --> 01:58:19,340
didn't like,
didn't take any shit from anybody.

2790
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:24,550
And he was walking,
I think through the yard of the 

2791
01:58:24,550 --> 01:58:27,140
fraternity guys who were dressed in 
their Sunday best,

2792
01:58:27,160 --> 01:58:32,160
like they had their,
their dockers on and their ties into 

2793
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:33,350
their dressed up and to the best that I 
can remember.

2794
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:37,340
Somebody said something to him that 
didn't fucking hit him the right way.

2795
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:38,870
Like,
like you know,

2796
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:42,100
about like maybe walking through lawn or

2797
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,530
like why he was at their house or 
something.

2798
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:47,500
And I don't remember exactly how it 
started,

2799
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:53,040
but I know how it fucking ended,
like Brian Jack fucking laid out 

2800
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:55,960
everyone who was basically in this 
fraternity like,

2801
01:58:55,961 --> 01:58:58,000
and it was like,
it was pretty fucking impressive.

2802
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:01,270
And I had a front fucking row.
What kind of an athlete was this guy?

2803
01:59:01,271 --> 01:59:03,460
What he,
he played football and he was.

2804
01:59:03,461 --> 01:59:04,760
So it was a big guy.
No,

2805
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:07,210
he was a not like super big,
like,

2806
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:10,420
like just a lean,
like,

2807
01:59:10,421 --> 01:59:12,340
uh,
I would say like six feet,

2808
01:59:12,450 --> 01:59:13,450
like two,
oh five.

2809
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:16,110
But like rock,
fucking solid and,

2810
01:59:16,160 --> 01:59:16,720
and,
and,

2811
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:18,820
and a little crazy.
And he actually,

2812
01:59:18,821 --> 01:59:23,821
I think played one of the season,
like he broke his neck and he kept 

2813
01:59:23,821 --> 01:59:25,330
playing.
And even played like Xfl like that,

2814
01:59:25,331 --> 01:59:30,331
that,
that league that came out that was just 

2815
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:30,331
like,
you know,

2816
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:30,331
there's not,
there aren't any rules.

2817
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:31,990
Like he played,
he played in that league I think.

2818
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:33,580
Anyways,
now he's a wrestler.

2819
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:38,930
Like I think he's trying to do wwf.
And I got a video sent to me.

2820
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:45,140
Uh,
he calls himself but wild is it on 

2821
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:45,140
youtube?
On Youtube?

2822
01:59:45,140 --> 01:59:45,820
Yeah.
Let's find this guy on youtube.

2823
01:59:46,650 --> 01:59:47,920
Yeah.
And I was like,

2824
01:59:47,921 --> 01:59:49,030
Holy Shit.
Bj.

2825
01:59:49,031 --> 01:59:50,650
The wrestlers,
what he calls himself

2826
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:58,980
Buck Wild Bj the wrestler.
That's Mickey work.

2827
02:00:00,360 --> 02:00:04,260
No buck wild as a band.
A lot of bad shit on here.

2828
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:07,650
Wow.
There's a,

2829
02:00:07,651 --> 02:00:09,230
I don't know,
we'll have to find it.

2830
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:16,400
There's some bucks.
Something as a fucking gay porn star 

2831
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:21,680
named Buck something or other.
And it used to be a woman and she took 

2832
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:21,680
a.
Oh my God,

2833
02:00:21,680 --> 02:00:24,750
I saw the hormones.
Male porn star.

2834
02:00:24,751 --> 02:00:27,930
But he has a vagina.
Hbo fucking Porn showed.

2835
02:00:27,931 --> 02:00:29,100
Yeah.
What is the name?

2836
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,340
Cornucopia was the name of the name of 
the guy.

2837
02:00:32,370 --> 02:00:33,930
I'm sure you fucking people

2838
02:00:34,250 --> 02:00:36,260
online know about it.
Yeah.

2839
02:00:38,130 --> 02:00:39,770
Um,
I dunno.

2840
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:42,110
Whatever.
That's not important.

2841
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:43,720
Your,
your,

2842
02:00:43,740 --> 02:00:45,330
your dude.
Beat the fuck out of that guy.

2843
02:00:45,331 --> 02:00:46,680
Buck Angel.
Thank you sir.

2844
02:00:46,740 --> 02:00:47,760
Thank you.
Angel.

2845
02:00:47,761 --> 02:00:49,230
Yeah,
wild will.

2846
02:00:49,231 --> 02:00:52,830
Dynamic Willie.
Dynamic people in your silly names.

2847
02:00:53,090 --> 02:00:55,260
This whatever.
Don't look at buck angel.

2848
02:00:55,470 --> 02:01:00,470
Just like,
I don't want to look at the human 

2849
02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:01,821
centipede and just like,
you don't want to look at Russian dudes 

2850
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:01,821
cutting people's heads off.
You don't need to see that.

2851
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:01,821
No,
no,

2852
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:06,451
no.
What's the worst thing you've ever seen 

2853
02:01:06,451 --> 02:01:06,451
online?
The worst thing I've seen online.

2854
02:01:06,451 --> 02:01:10,560
Probably some shit that you show me.
I remember I was uh,

2855
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:13,750
I take great pride in that.
I always say that when you send somebody

2856
02:01:13,751 --> 02:01:14,710
something fucked up,
it's like,

2857
02:01:14,770 --> 02:01:17,260
it's like a bomb.
You just wait for them to react.

2858
02:01:17,710 --> 02:01:22,710
You what's going to hit send and it just
goes to them and you know it's going to 

2859
02:01:22,710 --> 02:01:22,930
hit them.
The what the fuck.

2860
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:24,910
And then they type back and you'd get it
in your inbox.

2861
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:26,680
Like,
I mean,

2862
02:01:26,850 --> 02:01:29,950
you know,
the first time I saw two girls,

2863
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:34,120
one cup was very alarming,
but one guy,

2864
02:01:34,121 --> 02:01:37,390
one cup definitely was more like get the
fuck outta here.

2865
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:39,470
And then one guy,
one cup,

2866
02:01:39,471 --> 02:01:41,390
the most disturbing thing was the scars 
around his.

2867
02:01:42,290 --> 02:01:42,740
Well,
you know,

2868
02:01:42,741 --> 02:01:47,741
he's been doing this for awhile or his.
How about his basically non-reaction to 

2869
02:01:47,741 --> 02:01:52,360
what's happening.
Take the cream and how or even quiver 

2870
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:52,360
move,
right?

2871
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:52,870
Yeah.
He didn't even buckle.

2872
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:58,180
Homeboys got giant chunks of glass and 
blood coming out of his asshole and he's

2873
02:01:58,631 --> 02:02:00,640
just fine with it.
I mean if you haven't seen it,

2874
02:02:00,641 --> 02:02:02,020
you don't need to see it.
Don't,

2875
02:02:02,021 --> 02:02:03,550
don't go to one guy.
One Cup.

2876
02:02:03,551 --> 02:02:05,170
Don't go.
Don't check that out.

2877
02:02:05,470 --> 02:02:07,900
Mr Hanson and Mrs Hands were pretty 
crazy.

2878
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:10,150
This is Mrs Hamer,
Mrs Hamer.

2879
02:02:10,340 --> 02:02:12,270
Oh that's the girl gets fired.

2880
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,410
Oh my God.
And that's what they call her.

2881
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:16,190
Mrs Hanson.

2882
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:22,530
The things that I don't like the most,
the things that I can't react to or like

2883
02:02:22,531 --> 02:02:25,470
the ultra real violent shit.
That's the stuff I'm like,

2884
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:30,360
I fucking can't do this.
I'll do this crazy sexual or whatever.

2885
02:02:30,361 --> 02:02:32,940
But I'm with you.
Larry Berg,

2886
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:36,030
the title,
the decapitations and shit man.

2887
02:02:36,031 --> 02:02:38,610
You know the conspiracy theory behind 
the Nick Bird Shit?

2888
02:02:38,640 --> 02:02:39,080
No.

2889
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:42,490
Those guys are not Arabs that they're 
actually CIA and they're Americans.

2890
02:02:42,491 --> 02:02:45,730
Apparently their accents are off.
They're too big,

2891
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,830
like the,
they're not built like Arabs.

2892
02:02:47,831 --> 02:02:52,831
They're like big bulky fat fucking be 
feeding American psychos and really 

2893
02:02:52,831 --> 02:02:54,340
invested in the idea is that they,
uh,

2894
02:02:54,370 --> 02:02:58,150
they killed a guy to make people more 
excited.

2895
02:02:58,151 --> 02:03:03,151
They found some guy over there.
He's doing what he's not supposed to be 

2896
02:03:03,151 --> 02:03:03,151
doing,
going in a place where he's not supposed

2897
02:03:03,151 --> 02:03:04,150
to be going.
And so they jacked him,

2898
02:03:04,180 --> 02:03:09,180
arrested him and cut his fucking head 
off so that he could act as a deterrent 

2899
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:14,520
for people that want to go and 
investigate this and can get people 

2900
02:03:14,520 --> 02:03:15,940
enthusiastic about this war.
Like,

2901
02:03:15,941 --> 02:03:20,941
yeah,
we got to get these motherfuckers done 

2902
02:03:20,941 --> 02:03:21,130
that they're evil.
That's a big PR strategy man.

2903
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:22,930
For a guy like that,
you know,

2904
02:03:23,110 --> 02:03:25,480
you could take a guy and use him as a 
tool.

2905
02:03:25,480 --> 02:03:30,480
Like Samsung guy finds out some shit.
He's not supposed to find out or go 

2906
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:30,480
somewhere he's not supposed to go.
And then,

2907
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:35,270
you know,
if he can encourage other people to do 

2908
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:35,270
it,
they can have a real problem.

2909
02:03:35,270 --> 02:03:38,040
They just cut this guy's head off and 
make a video out of it and now not only 

2910
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:38,320
will,
that shit never happened again,

2911
02:03:38,321 --> 02:03:43,321
nobody wants to go over there.
Now they're cutting your fucking head 

2912
02:03:43,321 --> 02:03:45,421
off and putting it on a video and you 
see that guy gagging gurgle and make 

2913
02:03:45,421 --> 02:03:46,390
these horrible noises while he still 
alive in there,

2914
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:49,450
saw him through his fucking neck,
you know,

2915
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:51,760
and it gets people fired up about going 
to war,

2916
02:03:51,790 --> 02:03:53,770
you know,
an award that's not a very popular war

2917
02:03:53,860 --> 02:03:58,860
know you got to be a cold like I can,
I can under like I can see in certain 

2918
02:04:00,101 --> 02:04:01,750
circumstances,
you know,

2919
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:03,580
how somebody kills somebody.
Like,

2920
02:04:03,581 --> 02:04:05,080
you know,
I mean I understand that there's a level

2921
02:04:05,081 --> 02:04:07,470
that you cross that like,
you know,

2922
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:09,760
so somebody could do something where you
could kill somebody.

2923
02:04:09,820 --> 02:04:14,820
Yeah,
I understand that human biologically 

2924
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:17,380
you're going to react if somebody 
crosses a certain line where it happens.

2925
02:04:17,590 --> 02:04:20,160
But to cut someone's head off,
you'd have to be a savage mother.

2926
02:04:20,750 --> 02:04:25,750
Especially with a little knife.
You're not even losing a fucking going 

2927
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:27,380
Samurai song through it,
through it,

2928
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:28,910
you know?
I guess,

2929
02:04:28,911 --> 02:04:33,911
man,
there's certain amount of people that 

2930
02:04:33,911 --> 02:04:33,911
feel like,
you know,

2931
02:04:33,911 --> 02:04:36,260
you have a goal and you have a job and 
you do that job and your objective is to

2932
02:04:36,261 --> 02:04:38,040
fucking know,
do whatever you

2933
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:43,040
know,
do whatever the orders are and the 

2934
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:45,591
orders are to kill this guy because 
you're going to make a video and this 

2935
02:04:45,591 --> 02:04:48,561
guy's going to be a martyr and you know,
we're going to use him as a publicity 

2936
02:04:48,561 --> 02:04:49,170
tool.
You alright bitch,

2937
02:04:49,230 --> 02:04:50,880
guess you got to die.
You know,

2938
02:04:50,910 --> 02:04:52,650
I mean,
how many fucking people have been killed

2939
02:04:52,830 --> 02:04:54,660
in interrogations that were innocent?
I mean,

2940
02:04:54,661 --> 02:04:56,850
how many people are in Guantanamo Bay 
that are innocent?

2941
02:04:56,851 --> 02:05:01,350
How many people have been killed by 
accidental bombs and other hit apartment

2942
02:05:01,351 --> 02:05:04,150
buildings and shit at a certain number?
A certain.

2943
02:05:04,151 --> 02:05:05,910
Certainly you see a certain amount of 
casualties.

2944
02:05:05,911 --> 02:05:08,350
I think life starts to get real cheap.
You know,

2945
02:05:08,351 --> 02:05:12,180
we see it a certain amount of collateral
damage that happens.

2946
02:05:12,181 --> 02:05:15,180
It's just a part of the game.
I think for a lot of these guys,

2947
02:05:15,181 --> 02:05:17,190
life just starts to get started to get 
cheap.

2948
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:18,390
Yeah,
I think you're right.

2949
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,130
I think you're right.
Scary Shit,

2950
02:05:20,131 --> 02:05:21,030
man,
scary shit.

2951
02:05:21,031 --> 02:05:24,930
The idea that someone is willing to cut 
someone's head off for a video,

2952
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:27,930
but if you look at like operation 
northwoods,

2953
02:05:28,170 --> 02:05:33,170
if you look at that idea,
the idea of attacking Americans and 

2954
02:05:33,170 --> 02:05:34,050
blaming on Cubans so that we can go to 
war.

2955
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:38,280
It really fits into the whole like,
past scheme of things.

2956
02:05:38,710 --> 02:05:40,600
Yeah.
Yeah.

2957
02:05:40,630 --> 02:05:43,060
I mean they're definitely all about 
getting a,

2958
02:05:43,210 --> 02:05:45,730
you have to get the American people on 
your side for shit like this.

2959
02:05:45,731 --> 02:05:47,830
So that's why there's always a big push,
you know,

2960
02:05:48,190 --> 02:05:49,900
we got it.
You got to get people to go like,

2961
02:05:49,901 --> 02:05:50,670
yeah,
we got to get them.

2962
02:05:50,680 --> 02:05:51,340
We've got to get them.

2963
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:53,890
God Damn fucking horrible.
I'm gonna,

2964
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:55,460
uh,
take a few questions then we're going to

2965
02:05:55,461 --> 02:05:56,330
get out of here.
It's already five,

2966
02:05:56,331 --> 02:05:59,480
13.
You didn't watch the UFC this weekend,

2967
02:05:59,481 --> 02:06:03,110
did you know?
So I can't talk too much about the UFC.

2968
02:06:03,410 --> 02:06:08,410
I'm a pretty interesting because a Josh 
Koscheck beat up this dude.

2969
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:13,340
He fought,
he fought Paul Daley and was beating him

2970
02:06:13,341 --> 02:06:16,280
up,
took him down at will.

2971
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:17,060
And,
uh,

2972
02:06:17,061 --> 02:06:19,280
at one point in time in the fight,
um,

2973
02:06:19,550 --> 02:06:20,270
he,
uh,

2974
02:06:20,330 --> 02:06:24,680
he got kneed in the face in illegal knee
and it didn't look in the replay like it

2975
02:06:24,681 --> 02:06:25,640
hit him at all,
it looked like.

2976
02:06:26,380 --> 02:06:28,730
And he went down and it was like making 
it,

2977
02:06:28,731 --> 02:06:31,580
like he was really badly hurt.
I don't know if he was hurting.

2978
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,310
He says he was so,
but it didn't look real.

2979
02:06:34,840 --> 02:06:37,340
It was,
it might've been part of his strategy to

2980
02:06:37,341 --> 02:06:39,410
fuck with this dude because he was 
relentless.

2981
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:41,860
He taunting and tormenting them.
Like he would take them down.

2982
02:06:41,890 --> 02:06:44,840
He was talking shit to him while I was 
on top of him beating him up and the guy

2983
02:06:44,841 --> 02:06:47,630
just could not get up.
And every time he wanted to he took them

2984
02:06:47,631 --> 02:06:52,631
down in the last 30 seconds.
He's just talking shit to this dude 

2985
02:06:52,631 --> 02:06:56,290
while he's on top of him always trying 
to gouge his eyes when he's on the 

2986
02:06:56,290 --> 02:06:56,300
bottom.
It was crazy,

2987
02:06:56,301 --> 02:06:57,650
man.
And he was just like,

2988
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:02,680
I don't know what the fuck he said,
but whatever he said it was driving him 

2989
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:02,680
nuts.
So anyway,

2990
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:05,100
the bell ends to the round.
He gets off the students,

2991
02:07:05,110 --> 02:07:10,110
starts to walk away and Paul daily walks
up behind him like when like walks up 

2992
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:15,071
behind the referee,
walks up to him and sucker punches him 

2993
02:07:15,071 --> 02:07:15,140
after the fight was over.
Yeah,

2994
02:07:15,141 --> 02:07:18,330
it gets booted from the UFC for life,
which you know,

2995
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:20,360
can't do that,
you know that,

2996
02:07:20,361 --> 02:07:25,361
that you can't have a fight and then try
to sucker punch a guy because you didn't

2997
02:07:25,371 --> 02:07:30,371
get to hit them for 15 minutes because 
he was too good because it was taking 

2998
02:07:30,371 --> 02:07:31,550
you down and he was imposing his game 
plan on you and they sucker punch.

2999
02:07:31,550 --> 02:07:33,410
I'm daily as booted for life.
For Life.

3000
02:07:33,470 --> 02:07:35,350
Yeah.
He fucked up you and,

3001
02:07:35,351 --> 02:07:38,240
and Dana White got really Paris.
He asked him a question like,

3002
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:40,120
you asked him apparently after the fight
was over,

3003
02:07:40,420 --> 02:07:41,190
do you,
uh,

3004
02:07:41,230 --> 02:07:43,020
do you still want to fight in the UFC 
and you know,

3005
02:07:43,021 --> 02:07:48,021
like why are you doing shit like this is
like any like shrug his shoulders and 

3006
02:07:48,021 --> 02:07:48,021
walked away and Dana White was like,
good,

3007
02:07:48,021 --> 02:07:50,260
well now you want,
I'll make that decision for you and just

3008
02:07:50,261 --> 02:07:51,820
like,
you can't do shit like that if you do,

3009
02:07:52,350 --> 02:07:57,350
you've got to keep your composure.
Like you talk a lot of shit before the 

3010
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:57,350
fight.
And He,

3011
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:59,080
this guy talks mad shit.
Like that's his thing.

3012
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:04,320
And cost check talks mad shit too.
So Paul Dale and construct which is 

3013
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:06,370
going back and forth and back and forth.
And it generated an incredible amount of

3014
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,360
interest in the fight.

3015
02:08:07,630 --> 02:08:12,630
But it also put an incredible amount of 
pressure on him and when he was getting 

3016
02:08:12,630 --> 02:08:15,691
his ass kicked and,
and when it was over and it just got 

3017
02:08:15,691 --> 02:08:16,750
molested for fucking three rounds,
like an end of the knee,

3018
02:08:16,751 --> 02:08:18,520
which may or may not have hit cost 
check.

3019
02:08:18,521 --> 02:08:20,620
And you know,
it made it look like a big deal.

3020
02:08:20,621 --> 02:08:25,621
And Kasha Globe was lying on her stomach
and it was like making it look like he 

3021
02:08:25,621 --> 02:08:26,410
was out.
And then when the referee said to him,

3022
02:08:26,660 --> 02:08:28,090
referee said,
get up.

3023
02:08:28,091 --> 02:08:30,310
I saw the replay Denberg Eliade goes,
get up.

3024
02:08:30,311 --> 02:08:31,450
I saw the replay.
It didn't hit you.

3025
02:08:31,451 --> 02:08:31,960
He goes,
well,

3026
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:33,280
can you give us vaseline?
None of my eye.

3027
02:08:34,100 --> 02:08:37,510
And he gets the vaseline was,
it goes back to fighting like normal.

3028
02:08:37,511 --> 02:08:40,810
Like what happened if you were almost 
dead just a few seconds ago.

3029
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:46,100
So it was,
I think that was all part of his 

3030
02:08:46,100 --> 02:08:47,370
psychological strategy to just fuck that
dude's head up and it works.

3031
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:48,150
Hook,
line and sinker.

3032
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:50,010
I really did.
And then at the end of the fight,

3033
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:51,650
we're fucking Montreal.
Okay.

3034
02:08:51,660 --> 02:08:53,600
Montreal's in the middle of this huge 
playoff.

3035
02:08:53,670 --> 02:08:58,080
The Canadians against Pittsburgh.
So he goes and he grabs the microphone,

3036
02:08:58,170 --> 02:09:03,170
who's don't worry about it because 
picked going to kick your fucking ass 

3037
02:09:03,170 --> 02:09:03,170
shit.
And they go nuts.

3038
02:09:03,170 --> 02:09:08,151
I mean,
you never seen anybody like a sport or 

3039
02:09:08,151 --> 02:09:09,840
love hockey more than the Canadian.
Oh my God.

3040
02:09:10,080 --> 02:09:12,180
Do they go nuts?
And then he said Nafta,

3041
02:09:12,210 --> 02:09:15,390
that I'm going to beat GSP and you'll 
have to fucking losses.

3042
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:17,340
And they went nuts and they,
you know,

3043
02:09:17,341 --> 02:09:22,341
and he leaves.
But meanwhile the dude is a fucking 

3044
02:09:22,341 --> 02:09:22,790
master strategist when it comes to that 
shit.

3045
02:09:22,791 --> 02:09:23,310
Yeah.
I mean,

3046
02:09:23,311 --> 02:09:24,000
he's a,
he'll,

3047
02:09:24,001 --> 02:09:27,790
he's playing the heel and everyone will 
be so excited to see his friends.

3048
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:32,190
Of course there's fucking brilliant man 
generates so much more interest and made

3049
02:09:32,191 --> 02:09:33,480
himself a great villain.
Right?

3050
02:09:33,870 --> 02:09:36,450
He's a fucking these.
Where's the black hat and the business,

3051
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:37,460
you know.
So.

3052
02:09:37,550 --> 02:09:38,880
So he did that.
But dude,

3053
02:09:38,881 --> 02:09:42,150
the fucking disappointment in the 
Canadians when he goes,

3054
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:45,270
don't worry about it because is going to
kick your fucking ass next week.

3055
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:51,140
They were like,
it was like you said something about 

3056
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:53,030
their mother mad.
They were so fucking good.

3057
02:09:53,031 --> 02:09:53,080
I

3058
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:54,930
do.
They were so upset.

3059
02:09:54,931 --> 02:09:59,931
I've never seen a crowd more universally
excited about a sport and a team than 

3060
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:03,500
the Canadians are about their hockey 
dude.

3061
02:10:03,510 --> 02:10:05,700
When they won,
we got there Thursday night and they won

3062
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:09,330
and they won from behind.
It came from behind them one and when we

3063
02:10:09,331 --> 02:10:14,331
were driving right when we were driving 
the game got out and they want and the 

3064
02:10:14,331 --> 02:10:14,510
fucking cab drivers town us.
Oh,

3065
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:16,330
he's talking to us in France to,
you know,

3066
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:19,350
this franchise thing.
They want to fund the leader to the hood

3067
02:10:19,351 --> 02:10:20,790
and bag.
They could not hold him back.

3068
02:10:20,850 --> 02:10:21,670
He took the mic,
the go.

3069
02:10:21,671 --> 02:10:26,671
They tried to stop him.
He couldn't stop him and he's fucking 

3070
02:10:26,671 --> 02:10:29,091
crazy.
He's beeping his arm and everybody 

3071
02:10:29,091 --> 02:10:29,091
else's beeping alarm.
It was a fucking party down the street.

3072
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:33,090
Every car was honking their horn.
People were jumping on top of the hoods,

3073
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:34,160
cars and screaming

3074
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:39,160
and yelling and everyone in a big smile 
on their face like you've never seen so 

3075
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:43,241
many people,
united people that weren't at the game 

3076
02:10:43,241 --> 02:10:43,241
because people that were leaving the 
game,

3077
02:10:43,241 --> 02:10:44,660
they were fine up to everybody on the 
street.

3078
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:46,970
It's like family.
It's like your family.

3079
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,050
Yeah,
Dude.

3080
02:10:48,080 --> 02:10:52,070
It's a level of love for a sport and a 
team.

3081
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:55,160
They must take it hard though when those
guys lose.

3082
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:55,880
Oh God.
Yeah.

3083
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:59,450
That's devastating to them.
I've been in Vancouver when like,

3084
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:01,700
I think it wasn't even like the an NHL 
team.

3085
02:11:01,701 --> 02:11:04,520
I think it was like a,
like a club league team was playing,

3086
02:11:04,521 --> 02:11:07,640
like their club team was playing and 
businesses shut down.

3087
02:11:07,670 --> 02:11:09,760
People were on the streets for a game 
like there.

3088
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:11,360
Everything's going to be different 
tonight.

3089
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:12,620
That's crazy,
man.

3090
02:11:12,650 --> 02:11:14,540
That's crazy.
You don't see that in America,

3091
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:15,520
but not more.

3092
02:11:15,530 --> 02:11:18,090
At least when I was a kid,
the red sox,

3093
02:11:18,091 --> 02:11:20,810
when the red sox won the world series 
was the bill buckner when the,

3094
02:11:20,811 --> 02:11:23,420
when the ball went through his leg,
that was a big goddamn deal.

3095
02:11:23,421 --> 02:11:28,421
The whole,
the whole city was into that and people 

3096
02:11:28,421 --> 02:11:28,820
that,
that have been a very similar situation.

3097
02:11:28,850 --> 02:11:32,180
They had won the world series back then.
I think maybe it's still like that.

3098
02:11:32,181 --> 02:11:33,560
I don't,
I'm just not in Boston anymore,

3099
02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:38,770
but I don't think it is.
I don't remember it ever being the 

3100
02:11:38,770 --> 02:11:38,770
intensity level that it wasn't Canada 
and Canada.

3101
02:11:38,770 --> 02:11:40,160
Those motherfuckers,
they,

3102
02:11:40,161 --> 02:11:41,080
they,
they loved it.

3103
02:11:41,120 --> 02:11:42,800
Man.
You see this guy,

3104
02:11:43,530 --> 02:11:45,950
Laura's vilks,
he's the Swedish,

3105
02:11:47,210 --> 02:11:50,300
the Swedish.
I'm a cartoonist that drew the,

3106
02:11:50,301 --> 02:11:52,310
uh,
the image of Muhammad with his body,

3107
02:11:52,311 --> 02:11:54,680
a of Mohammed's head on the body of a 
dog.

3108
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:56,300
He's,
they're all trying to do,

3109
02:11:56,301 --> 02:11:59,210
but trying to kill him for like two 
years before I heard about him.

3110
02:11:59,620 --> 02:12:01,730
Like drawing it.
Is that actual footage of the attack?

3111
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:02,630
Yeah.
Look at this shit.

3112
02:12:02,631 --> 02:12:04,910
They did a,
I won't put the volume on,

3113
02:12:04,970 --> 02:12:07,580
it don't matter anyway because it's a,
it's all in,

3114
02:12:07,730 --> 02:12:10,230
in a,
I guess it's in Swedish,

3115
02:12:10,231 --> 02:12:12,200
the Swedish.
So that's him right there.

3116
02:12:12,220 --> 02:12:17,220
So he's showed us this video on religion
and uh,

3117
02:12:17,690 --> 02:12:19,610
during the middle of the video on 
religion,

3118
02:12:19,611 --> 02:12:21,770
all these Muslims apparently a super 
offended.

3119
02:12:21,771 --> 02:12:23,930
They run up and they tackle him and 
punch him in the head.

3120
02:12:24,160 --> 02:12:26,390
It's one dude punches him in the head,
that guy,

3121
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:30,290
and then they have to fucking tear gas 
people and they all start screaming.

3122
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:32,670
Allah Akbar.
Oh,

3123
02:12:32,710 --> 02:12:33,810
they're all,
all.

3124
02:12:33,811 --> 02:12:36,410
Yeah,
they're all there to go after this guy.

3125
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:39,560
They're all there to attack this guy.
It's crazy man.

3126
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:42,050
And they're all angry and they're young.
They're students.

3127
02:12:42,051 --> 02:12:44,600
They have fucking laptops and cameras 
and shit.

3128
02:12:44,780 --> 02:12:49,780
And they really truly believe that this 
guy's a piece of shit for drawing their 

3129
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:49,780
guy.

3130
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:51,260
Yeah man.
Scary shit man.

3131
02:12:51,390 --> 02:12:55,760
This kind of type of fundamentalism and 
retarded thinking is very frightened.

3132
02:12:55,761 --> 02:13:00,761
She,
that guy just hit that guy for no 

3133
02:13:00,761 --> 02:13:01,871
reason.
Look at a faggy way through that punch 

3134
02:13:01,871 --> 02:13:02,430
to indent the weak as shit.
They're fucking sad looking at.

3135
02:13:02,470 --> 02:13:03,800
Oh Man.
Yeah.

3136
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:05,750
Nuts man.
Look at him.

3137
02:13:05,990 --> 02:13:07,460
He got some weekends.
Cops there,

3138
02:13:07,461 --> 02:13:08,450
man.
I think that's a chick.

3139
02:13:08,680 --> 02:13:10,150
Oh,
isn't it?

3140
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:11,990
You can control.
She's got terrible.

3141
02:13:11,991 --> 02:13:13,710
So I control.
So that's tricky.

3142
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:15,590
Is that a trick?
I think she should break that arm.

3143
02:13:15,591 --> 02:13:17,150
She got it right there.
You just take that arm.

3144
02:13:17,350 --> 02:13:18,890
Um,
if you haven't seen the video,

3145
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:23,891
it's,
it's unremarkable other than the fact 

3146
02:13:23,891 --> 02:13:26,471
that it's just another group of retarded
fucking religious people screaming and 

3147
02:13:26,471 --> 02:13:29,861
yelling.
They're the most scary because 

3148
02:13:29,861 --> 02:13:29,861
Christians,
you know,

3149
02:13:29,861 --> 02:13:29,861
you're allowed to draw Jesus.
You know,

3150
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:32,000
Jesus.
This is

3151
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:37,460
so fucking crazy things rather guy to 
actually to like to validate that point 

3152
02:13:37,591 --> 02:13:39,270
of view.
It was ridiculous.

3153
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:40,780
Oh,
it's so scary though,

3154
02:13:40,781 --> 02:13:45,781
man.
It's so scary that this is still going 

3155
02:13:45,781 --> 02:13:48,241
on in 2010 and not only are these guys 
like these college students,

3156
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:50,650
but these guys are actually,
you know,

3157
02:13:51,070 --> 02:13:56,070
they have laptops,
they're in their hands while they're 

3158
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:56,070
there.
They have,

3159
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:56,070
you know,
they have cameras,

3160
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:57,910
digital cameras,
they have access to the Internet.

3161
02:13:58,150 --> 02:14:03,150
They even have like forums and message 
boards and shed where they go and you 

3162
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:03,720
know,
like the south park guys,

3163
02:14:03,730 --> 02:14:06,100
the ones who wanted to kill South Park 
and then somebody hacked them.

3164
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:06,910
Just see that.
No,

3165
02:14:06,911 --> 02:14:09,810
I didn't know it was awesome.
Somebody hacked him in the picture was a

3166
02:14:09,870 --> 02:14:14,870
Muslim guy kissing another guy and uh,
the whole background was like all like 

3167
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:21,100
Mohammed's head with a bomb in his 
turban and the left an email address for

3168
02:14:21,791 --> 02:14:26,791
these guys to um,
less than an email address for these 

3169
02:14:26,791 --> 02:14:30,140
guys to a um,
a two email them contact though.

3170
02:14:30,250 --> 02:14:30,960
That's hospital

3171
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:34,370
that but liquid.
Is it just me or this road and look like

3172
02:14:34,371 --> 02:14:36,710
he was talking to a future outta shape 
version.

3173
02:14:37,750 --> 02:14:39,350
That's hilarious.
Best guests.

3174
02:14:39,351 --> 02:14:39,860
Okay.
So far.

3175
02:14:39,860 --> 02:14:41,750
Says this guy,
Thomas you girl.

3176
02:14:41,900 --> 02:14:46,270
We're looking on our forums.
It's a forum,

3177
02:14:46,450 --> 02:14:48,920
[inaudible] dot Joe Rogan.net
and that is,

3178
02:14:48,921 --> 02:14:50,120
uh,
that's the,

3179
02:14:50,121 --> 02:14:52,100
uh,
the main forum for my website.

3180
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:55,670
It's pretty fucking crazy website.
It's all the podcasts.

3181
02:14:55,671 --> 02:14:57,740
Go on there.
I used to put a lot of,

3182
02:14:57,741 --> 02:15:02,741
um,
I used to put a lot of blogs up and I 

3183
02:15:02,741 --> 02:15:05,621
still will write some,
but right now I'm in the middle of 

3184
02:15:05,621 --> 02:15:05,621
writing a,
a,

3185
02:15:05,621 --> 02:15:05,621
a movie.
So,

3186
02:15:05,621 --> 02:15:05,621
or moving no,
a book.

3187
02:15:05,810 --> 02:15:08,420
And so I got an idea for a movie,
but I'm,

3188
02:15:08,690 --> 02:15:13,690
I'm writing a book and once I'm done 
with that then I'll be doing a lot more 

3189
02:15:13,690 --> 02:15:17,321
blogs again.
But I got a couple more months to write 

3190
02:15:17,321 --> 02:15:19,811
this book.
Mostly about standup comedy in my early 

3191
02:15:19,811 --> 02:15:19,811
days,
like crazy stories and shit.

3192
02:15:19,811 --> 02:15:24,510
Obama's a fucking liar.
During the campaign he was listening to 

3193
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:25,340
his ipod playlist.
That's true.

3194
02:15:26,050 --> 02:15:28,190
See he knows how to use a fucking ipod.
Yes.

3195
02:15:28,191 --> 02:15:29,690
Rivalries.
You are correct sir.

3196
02:15:29,691 --> 02:15:32,300
Obama is a fucking liar.
I am.

3197
02:15:32,450 --> 02:15:35,510
I don't know why that's annoying to me,
but that shit is very,

3198
02:15:35,511 --> 02:15:38,480
very annoying.
I hear wearing gold jewelry and one part

3199
02:15:38,481 --> 02:15:42,020
of the Nick Berg video.
You can see a military cap move in front

3200
02:15:42,021 --> 02:15:44,780
of the camera.
He was working on phone lines.

3201
02:15:44,781 --> 02:15:47,090
He was working on a tower over in Abu 
Ghraib.

3202
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:50,600
He took digital pictures of inside Abu 
Ghraib,

3203
02:15:50,601 --> 02:15:55,601
hence the kidnapping,
so that's why they killed that guy and 

3204
02:15:55,601 --> 02:15:57,020
that's obviously a conspiracy theory,
but my man rivalries.

3205
02:15:57,080 --> 02:15:59,480
But that would make sense if that guy 
had witnessed,

3206
02:15:59,510 --> 02:16:01,220
you know,
the Abu Ghraib,

3207
02:16:01,250 --> 02:16:05,590
a atrocities before we're talking about 
the guy who got his head cut off when he

3208
02:16:05,591 --> 02:16:09,140
said that he was actually,
his head was cut off by CIA guys.

3209
02:16:09,170 --> 02:16:10,470
It totally makes sense.
You know,

3210
02:16:10,790 --> 02:16:12,290
I think they'd be willing to do 
something like that.

3211
02:16:14,300 --> 02:16:15,330
What the fuck do I know?
Man?

3212
02:16:16,330 --> 02:16:19,010
I don't got no solutions folks.
I only got questions.

3213
02:16:19,070 --> 02:16:21,350
You got any solutions?
Tommy Vaughn answers to anything.

3214
02:16:21,351 --> 02:16:23,990
No,
that's the goddamn problem is that there

3215
02:16:23,991 --> 02:16:28,991
are no answers.
We need a radical restructuring of our 

3216
02:16:28,991 --> 02:16:30,250
entire fucking society,
our entire

3217
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:35,250
world,
and that's not going to happen anytime 

3218
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:35,250
in our lifetimes.
So what do we.

3219
02:16:35,250 --> 02:16:35,380
Did we put a patch on things?
No,

3220
02:16:35,650 --> 02:16:39,040
you try to control your micro world.
That's what you do,

3221
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:41,110
ladies and gentlemen,
this is my advice.

3222
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:46,170
You want some advice,
control all the people that are around 

3223
02:16:46,170 --> 02:16:46,170
you,
control what you do for a living,

3224
02:16:46,170 --> 02:16:48,490
control your body,
control your mind,

3225
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:53,491
control how you treat other people and 
what kind of treatment you'll accept 

3226
02:16:53,491 --> 02:16:54,880
from other people.
If you do that,

3227
02:16:55,060 --> 02:16:58,660
and if that shit spreads and if people 
learn by your example,

3228
02:16:58,661 --> 02:17:01,240
then you really can make a change and a 
difference right there.

3229
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:02,980
Absolutely.
Make a small change,

3230
02:17:02,981 --> 02:17:05,710
a small difference locally,
sort of like politics,

3231
02:17:05,940 --> 02:17:07,300
local politics,
work,

3232
02:17:07,540 --> 02:17:09,330
you know like you can,
if you're a,

3233
02:17:09,331 --> 02:17:11,770
a local town,
you can choose to,

3234
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:16,860
you know,
put up a stop sign in an area where the 

3235
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:16,860
people need to stop because there's some
accidents,

3236
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:20,960
you know,
you can vote on that and that shit will 

3237
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:20,960
actually happen and it'll actually 
become something.

3238
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:20,960
State,
state politics.

3239
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:22,500
There's state laws that can get changed.
You know,

3240
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:25,390
the medical marijuana law in California 
is a clear example of that.

3241
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:26,850
They voted like,
yeah,

3242
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:29,620
the medical marijuana is helpful for 
people.

3243
02:17:29,710 --> 02:17:31,690
Let's vote.
Let's make it a real announcer reality.

3244
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:33,040
But federally,
man,

3245
02:17:33,220 --> 02:17:34,960
you don't get to vote on Shit like that 
federally.

3246
02:17:34,961 --> 02:17:37,210
You don't get to vote on shit like that 
when it comes to the whole country

3247
02:17:37,690 --> 02:17:41,760
and you can make changes in your life 
and people's lives around you too.

3248
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:45,190
If you want to fucking like talking 
about you can,

3249
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:49,210
you can get away from shit that's not 
affecting you in a good way and get away

3250
02:17:49,211 --> 02:17:51,010
from the people that are not good for 
you.

3251
02:17:51,011 --> 02:17:51,910
And that's what you do

3252
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:52,490
can control.
You,

3253
02:17:52,491 --> 02:17:55,670
can control what you're directly affect 
the people in your life,

3254
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:57,680
the way you think,
the way you behave.

3255
02:17:57,860 --> 02:17:59,840
You can control all that.
You know,

3256
02:17:59,870 --> 02:18:04,870
the real problem with us is that we have
so much more access to human beings and 

3257
02:18:05,001 --> 02:18:07,190
to,
to connecting to each other than we ever

3258
02:18:07,191 --> 02:18:09,470
had in the past.
That's why people or they feel like they

3259
02:18:09,471 --> 02:18:13,550
can be so douchey on message boards 
because there's no social consequence.

3260
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:18,760
There's no consequence to emailing 
someone on my space and just saying 

3261
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:18,760
nasty,
fucked up shit to them.

3262
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:19,490
You know,
I make comics.

3263
02:18:19,491 --> 02:18:24,491
Have you talked to.
They get horrible fucking messages on 

3264
02:18:24,491 --> 02:18:24,491
facebook,
on twitter,

3265
02:18:24,491 --> 02:18:25,970
and dudes just say shit,
just to get attention.

3266
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:27,440
People.
Yeah,

3267
02:18:27,470 --> 02:18:28,980
there's no,
there's no consequences.

3268
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,450
No Accountant.

3269
02:18:29,730 --> 02:18:32,400
Why would they even want to reach out to
someone like that?

3270
02:18:32,430 --> 02:18:33,920
Why would they even want to do that?
Like what?

3271
02:18:33,921 --> 02:18:35,130
What,
what is that all about?

3272
02:18:35,160 --> 02:18:36,360
Well,
it's all about the same thing.

3273
02:18:36,361 --> 02:18:41,361
It's all about we've lost some sort of a
connection with each other because 

3274
02:18:41,361 --> 02:18:44,721
there's too fucking many of us.
That's why local shit is the only shit 

3275
02:18:44,721 --> 02:18:44,960
that works,
you know,

3276
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,570
small groups,
the people that you actually impact,

3277
02:18:47,571 --> 02:18:49,660
like the people that you impact in your 
personal life,

3278
02:18:49,661 --> 02:18:51,570
the people that you impact,
the local politics,

3279
02:18:51,610 --> 02:18:53,850
people,
the impact that your job and in,

3280
02:18:53,870 --> 02:18:58,870
in,
in whatever the fuck you do for your 

3281
02:18:58,870 --> 02:18:58,870
living,
you know,

3282
02:18:58,870 --> 02:18:58,950
how you impact those people don't.
That shit's all real.

3283
02:18:59,790 --> 02:19:04,790
It's just the matter is how do you get 
it to work like that with the whole big 

3284
02:19:04,790 --> 02:19:04,790
giant group?
Yeah.

3285
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:05,640
Yeah.
You don't,

3286
02:19:05,641 --> 02:19:06,870
man,
we're fucking rambling.

3287
02:19:06,871 --> 02:19:11,871
We're not saying shit anymore.
Two hours and a half later,

3288
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:16,140
that's usually the end of the podcast.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3289
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:19,410
we come to a point of no point.
Yeah,

3290
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:22,740
it's the Zen ending,
but no conclusion.

3291
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:25,260
A lot of good points were made before we
got to know point.

3292
02:19:25,290 --> 02:19:28,070
Yeah.
Your friend who's a fucking ass ass

3293
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:31,190
in slacks and tie.
Shit and fuck with him.

3294
02:19:31,220 --> 02:19:32,960
Don't fuck with that.
Made a point.

3295
02:19:32,990 --> 02:19:34,610
Brian job.
We made a point.

3296
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:38,480
Let's review everything we learned.
Don't drink a whole mouthful of Ghb.

3297
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:43,780
That's just terrible for you.
That's really bad and your parents will 

3298
02:19:43,780 --> 02:19:47,081
be disappointed.
You don't wait until you're 40 years 

3299
02:19:47,081 --> 02:19:50,471
old.
You decided you want to be a standup 

3300
02:19:50,471 --> 02:19:50,471
comedian.
Don't do that.

3301
02:19:50,471 --> 02:19:50,960
It's likely that you're not Robert 
Schimmel.

3302
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:52,040
Yes,
likely.

3303
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:56,000
And if you are a a funny person and you 
are funny,

3304
02:19:56,001 --> 02:20:01,001
standup comedian and you don't assume 
that you have to live your life the same

3305
02:20:01,041 --> 02:20:04,370
way that got you there with no 
discipline and no self control.

3306
02:20:04,550 --> 02:20:09,550
You can get your shit together.
Even though neither Tommy nor myself 

3307
02:20:09,550 --> 02:20:09,670
have our shit together.
Shit.

3308
02:20:10,670 --> 02:20:14,000
Go by Tommy's CD.
It's called thrilled.

3309
02:20:14,030 --> 02:20:16,070
He's fucking hilarious.
A bank on it.

3310
02:20:16,110 --> 02:20:17,630
He's worked with me many times.

3311
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:19,850
You might have seen him with me and we 
were in Sydney,

3312
02:20:19,851 --> 02:20:20,840
Australia.
Together.

3313
02:20:21,050 --> 02:20:22,430
We've done.
And what else did we do?

3314
02:20:22,440 --> 02:20:24,950
Did we do San Francisco together within 
San Francisco?

3315
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:26,690
San Jose,
San Jose.

3316
02:20:26,750 --> 02:20:28,850
We've done a bunch of gigs together.
Fucking hilarious.

3317
02:20:28,851 --> 02:20:30,710
Comedian Thomson.
[inaudible] DOT com.

3318
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:33,830
Yes.
S E G U R a.com.

3319
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:39,160
Please follow him on twitter.
It's Thompson Guerra just right and I 

3320
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:43,811
have links for my itunes and Amazon.
And now you are officially on the Joe 

3321
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:47,600
Rogan podcast promoting the Thompson 
thrilled CD.

3322
02:20:47,750 --> 02:20:50,000
It will now below the fuck up your 
twitter.

3323
02:20:50,001 --> 02:20:53,510
I guarantee you by the end of the day 
you will have 10 more twitter followers.

3324
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:56,090
Nice.
I can at least guaranteed 10.

3325
02:20:56,091 --> 02:20:59,810
I guaranteed to purchases of this cd 
because of this.

3326
02:20:59,811 --> 02:21:04,811
That would not have happened.
I fucking really appreciate that 

3327
02:21:04,811 --> 02:21:04,940
motherfucker.
We also learned by the way,

3328
02:21:05,210 --> 02:21:07,760
that you can masturbate in a whole new 
way.

3329
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:10,100
Yes.
Fuck this.

3330
02:21:10,130 --> 02:21:14,600
It's way better than your fist and yes,
I am sponsored by fleshlight,

3331
02:21:14,601 --> 02:21:19,601
but if it sucked,
I would quit the sponsorship and I will 

3332
02:21:19,601 --> 02:21:20,540
tell you I would not sell you anything,
but I don't think is real.

3333
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:25,600
I will guarantee you this.
I'm not saying that I'll never have 

3334
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:27,911
sponsors,
but what I am saying that I will never 

3335
02:21:27,911 --> 02:21:30,850
try to endorse something that I don't 
think is an awesome product and this is 

3336
02:21:30,850 --> 02:21:34,091
a goddamn awesome product and it's for 
beating off which I'm for 12 feeding 

3337
02:21:34,190 --> 02:21:35,300
off.
Ladies and gentlemen,

3338
02:21:35,301 --> 02:21:37,160
thank you very much for tuning into the 
podcast.

3339
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:40,070
We will see you next week.
Next Tuesday,

3340
02:21:40,130 --> 02:21:42,410
same bat time,
same bat channel 3:00

3341
02:21:42,410 --> 02:21:44,510
PM Pacific and last Mrs.
Rogan.

3342
02:21:44,511 --> 02:21:46,850
Bus out the baby because she was ready 
to do it any day.

3343
02:21:46,851 --> 02:21:48,110
Now.
That might fuck up my schedule,

3344
02:21:48,111 --> 02:21:50,420
but either way the weekly podcast will 
continue.

3345
02:21:50,421 --> 02:21:52,730
I will keep you informed on twitter.
Thank you everybody.

3346
02:21:52,850 --> 02:21:54,860
Thank you very much for tuning in.
I love you bitches.

3347
02:21:54,920 --> 02:21:55,970
I'll see you soon.
Thank you.
