00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,020
And we're back,
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience

2
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:12,021
podcast is brought to you by legal zoom
to start the new year correctly.

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:14,760
Ladies and gentlemen,
I believe it's a perfect time to get

4
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:16,440
your life organized,
organized,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
organized.
How do you say Bryant?

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Legal Zoom can help.
Legal Zoom is a way of dealing with very

7
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:28,290
common and standard legal issues that
you would ordinarily have to go to a

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,680
lawyer and make an appointment and spend
a lot of money.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,780
You can get things done online for like
you can incorporate and form an llc

10
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:40,710
starting at $99.
You can protect your family with a last

11
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:44,820
will for $69 or get a living trust power
of attorney.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,190
And the beautiful thing about legal zoom
is if you panic,

13
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:48,330
if you're in the middle of it and you're
like,

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,223
oh,
this is,

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,820
this can't be illegal,
this is fucked.

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,570
Legal Zoom will connect you with an
independent attorney and you.

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,170
The whole process can be easily sorted
out.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,710
It can be.
They can help you with online support.

19
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:04,020
Their online process could not be much
easier.

20
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,140
They take care of you from start to
finish and now you get a special

21

discount from listening to the podcast.

23
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,060

firm,

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,250
but they could connect you with a third
party attorney and provide you with self

25
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:24,251
help services.
The self help services is easy to do.

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,080

It is how Brian Form Desk squad.

that was really,

28
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,310
really difficult to do in the past.
You had to know what the fuck you're

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,570
doing,
but now it's done for you.

send down and having them weigh and

52

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,060
Ladies and gentlemen.
Brian Denny.

76
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,350
Thank you sir.
Thanks for coming on.

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,990
The one of the cool things about the
internet is that you can get connected

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,680
to all these weird and unusual folks and
you can also exchange a lot of

79
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:06,140
information back and forth and find out
a lot of things about each other.

80
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,393
And,
uh,

81
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,290
I,
I read about,

82
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,030
you know,
nothing's coming.

83
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:13,870
This is fun friendly.
I read about you and uh,

84
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,710
I read some of the things that I didn't
know,

85
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:17,750
uh,
when you had contacted me that you had

86
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:20,660
included me in your.
How many celebrities were there?

87
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,220
Eight or 10.
It was a top 10.

88
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:25,750
Most wanted celebrities promoting
harmful pseudo science.

89
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,380
And in that I read about myself and I
was shocked to learn that I believe that

90
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,420
nine slash 11 was created by the
government.

91
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,570
I did not know.
I didn't know that.

92
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,790
I believe that.
I don't think you've ever said that.

93
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,310
I've never said that.
We can talk about the whole genesis of

94
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,780
how this list came to be.
Well,

95
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,030
that's a.
But that one is poorly researched.

96
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,330
I've absolutely never said that.
I think that the government engineered

97
00:04:47,331 --> 00:04:48,320
nine slash 11.
Well,

98
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,480
this was an episode I did in 2008,
which was five,

99
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:56,750
six years ago now,
and so before coming here today,

100
00:04:56,751 --> 00:04:59,630
I wanted to make sure and get all my
sources for all of these and

101
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:04,070
unfortunately back in 2008,
I was not yet keeping very good records

102
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,040
and saving my notes.
So for the things that I have listed

103
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,720
here,
unfortunately I can't give you the

104
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:11,900
source for any one of them,
but any one of them you want to tell him

105
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:13,930
he is not true.
I will happily retract it.

106
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,110
Well,
first of all,

107
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:16,580
the nine slash 11 one,
100 percent.

108
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,640
In fact,
I was on the phone with Alex Jones the

109
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:24,550
night that nine slash 11 happened.
The government engineer this documents,

110
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,710
they've been planning this since
operation northwoods.

111
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,140
I'm sure it didn't take him until that
night to figure it out.

112
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,720
He would probably.
Well I think he,

113
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,220
he actually might have even predicted
it,

114
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:36,200
but when you say that,
like people go,

115
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:37,880
Whoa,
is he a psychic?

116
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,580
He predicted a billion things that never
happened.

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,050
You know,
every day camps they've gotten coffins,

118
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:46,070
plastic,
coffins.

119
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,640
That doesn't mean that uh,
he was a clairvoyant.

120
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,230
It means he's,
he's a tightly,

121
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,600
tightly strong,
tightly wound up fella.

122
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,453
Oh,
do you think.

123
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,430
But uh,
I,

124
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,070
we debated it online on the air,

125
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,230
like,
you know,

126
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,170
I was like,
how do you,

127
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,470
you can't say that there's no evidence
that shows that the government did it

128
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,600
like you just because you suspect them
of doing it,

129
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,930
you can't say it.
There's also crazy shit that happens in

130
00:06:08,931 --> 00:06:11,480
planes flying into buildings.
And I have a doctor,

131
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,390
not a real good doctor,
but he's a pot doctors.

132
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,310
Dr Hans you out a medical marijuana
prescriptions,

133
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,610
but I guess he went to medical school.
I go to them the other day and he hands

134
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,600
me this book and he's like,
uh,

135
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:23,810
this is very important information.
And I go,

136
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,120
okay.
So I start reading it and it's about

137
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:30,090
tesla technology that they use to make
the twin towers disappeared.

138
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,000
I got that.
The twin towers,

139
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,970
the reason why they turned into dust and
they just didn't fall apart into big

140
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:36,610
chunks is cars.
Tesla Tech.

141
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,020
I thought he was,
I thought it was like having like a,

142
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,070
like a mental issue.
Like I thought something had blown a

143
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,740
fuse or something.
I was so confused by the conversation.

144
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,850
I didn't know what he was saying.
Like you're saying they used unknown

145
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:52,100
technology to make the buildings
disappear.

146
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:54,320
How did you know them?
He's got a thick book.

147
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,580
You see the whole thing.
Tesla mythology is a whole other area

148
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,960
of,
of BS,

149
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,460
which is,
which is amazing.

150
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,640
So many of the things that Tesla is
known for never happened.

151
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,200
Um,
he was,

152
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,380
he was certainly a,
a very brilliant man.

153
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,780
Certainly a,
an innovative engineer,

154
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,410
but he didn't invent AC.
He didn't invent electric motors.

155
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,530
These are all things that already
existed that he continued working on.

156
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:21,380
He never invented a death ray.
He was completely nuts by the time of

157
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:22,820
his life.
He said he had a death ray.

158
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,480
He and Edison did have the competition
or the competing ideas about alternating

159
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,380
current and direct current.
And he was an advocate of alternating or

160
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,540
alternating current where Edison in fact
did tests to show or did displays or

161
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,130
other demonstrations to show that
dangers of this.

162
00:07:38,131 --> 00:07:40,080
And one of the things they did is they
fried an elephant.

163
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,790
Yeah,
it's really fucked,

164
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:42,690
man.
If you watch it.

165
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:44,550
And he called it westing housing,
he called it.

166
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,770
We're going to westinghouse,
this elephant now.

167
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,720
He was hoping that that word would catch
on.

168
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,190
That's hilarious.
So,

169
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:51,750
um,
I don't know where you got the nine

170
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,960
slash 11 thing from a.
But if I had listened to me talk about

171
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:57,300
the moon landing,
I'd probably assume that I was also a

172
00:07:57,301 --> 00:08:00,420
nonbeliever in nine slash 11.
So no,

173
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,580
never said that.
And it never believed that.

174
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,880
The only thing I've ever said that's
controversial at all is that tower

175
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:07,050
seven.
When you watch it fall,

176
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,900
it looks like in controlled demolition.
And I don't think that's controversial

177
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:11,340
because it looks like a controlled
demolition.

178
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,660
Yeah.
When you look at just the top half of

179
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:13,200
it,
it does.

180
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,180
When you look at the whole thing,
the way the way the structure,

181
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:15,470
correct.

182
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,360
There's no video,
the whole thing,

183
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,800
you can only see the video of the top.
Really the top quarter of it as it

184
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,750
disappears behind the building and I
agree it does look exactly like a

185
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:24,650
controlled demolition.

186
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,670
Oh,
I believe it's more than the top

187
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,680
quarter.
Pull the pull the video up of tower

188
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:31,080
seven dropping.
There's some pretty mean.

189
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:33,420
There's at least 30 floors.
You're seeing.

190
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,040
You're seeing a lot of it.
It's not really.

191
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,440
I wouldn't say it's the top quarter is a
48 for building.

192
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,840
I don't know.
I'm not gonna argue the fraction,

193
00:08:39,841 --> 00:08:42,020
but you don't see the bottom of it was
true,

194
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,980
but it is very unusual how it falls into
its base instead of the falls over,

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,460
didn't

196
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,500
it felt it started to fall down
straight,

197
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:52,440
but then it almost destroyed two other
buildings that it fell against.

198
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,440
It didn't fall into its own foot.
Right.

199
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:57,830
Which any building that they were
demolishing would probably do as well if

200
00:08:57,831 --> 00:09:00,090
they were that close to each other and
that went wrong.

201
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:00,860
Right.
Yeah.

202
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,940
We'll watch it again here.
Look at that.

203
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,010
Yeah.
That's way more than a tough quarter.

204
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,933
Okay.
It's not.

205
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,940
That's almost the entire building was
not.

206
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,893
Okay.
Let's see.

207
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,970
We'll see it again because we caught
that in the middle.

208
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:14,400
Let's see it again.
Let's see it from the top.

209
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,640
This is not the best angle of a bunch of
different angles.

210
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,840
Okay.
Let's say it again.

211
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Pull that one back.
I mean it disappears into the smoke

212
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,750
before you can see,
but I think it's a bit disingenuous to

213
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,430
say that the thing doesn't fall into its
base.

214
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,600
Look at that.
It doesn't.

215
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:32,670
I mean it's already going at an angle.
Look at that.

216
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,370
Look at the k,
but it all fell to the bottom.

217
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,720
I mean,
let's look at that one.

218
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,130
Get her to fall to the top.
Okay,

219
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:41,160
but keep being kind of silly.
That thing collapsed into its space.

220
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,870
Look at that watch.
Here it goes.

221
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,130
That is most of the building vanishes
out of sight.

222
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:51,510
Who knows what happens from then on and
for sure it ran into other buildings.

223
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,390
The point is this,
it never happened before and it looks

224
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,260
like a controlled demolition.
I'm not saying,

225
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,830
but let me be clarified because this is
important.

226
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,330
I'm not saying it's a controlled
demolition.

227
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,150
I know I have no idea,
but that's what it looks like to say.

228
00:10:03,151 --> 00:10:04,500
It doesn't look like that.
It's kind of silly.

229
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,200
No,
I agree,

230
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,540
but if you want to see how it fell into
its own base,

231
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,030
quote unquote,
just look at the aerial photographs that

232
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:13,600
were taken the next day when all the
smoke had cleared and you can see that

233
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:16,690
didn't remotely fall into its own base.
It fell down the street and just

234
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,300
practically destroyed two other
buildings so

235
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:21,850
well.
That's a matter of all that material has

236
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:24,100
to go somewhere.
You had 48 floors of material and all

237
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:26,050
comes down and collapsed.
It's going to fly.

238
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,450
I'm not saying it didn't fly to the
side.

239
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:29,920
It fell over.
It doesn't.

240
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:33,520
It didn't fall down and then out tube in
all directions like it splattered.

241
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:36,460
It fell over.
It started going down and then it went

242
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,900
to an angle and fell off to the side.

243
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,380
This is a really.
This is an interesting thing because

244
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:45,760
this is a thing that a lot of people
want the world to be very black and

245
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:50,320
white and they want things like this to
be really simple to categorize.

246
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,500
I don't think it is and I don't agree
with you that that didn't fall into its

247
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,580
base.
Sure.

248
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:57,280
A lot of other shit happened and
probably big chunks of it landed on

249
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,100
buildings nearby,
but that thing collapsed into its base.

250
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,060
Did it collapse into its base because of
a gigantic diesel fire that it consumed

251
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:06,580
the innards of the building and weaken
the structure considerably?

252
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,930
Fuck,
for sure.

253
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:10,300
That's possible.
I don't know a Goddamn thing about my

254
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:11,900
dad's an architect.
You know,

255
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,510
I asked him about it and he said,
well,

256
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:15,160
it's unusual,
but you don't know what the hell is

257
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,110
going on inside of it.
You don't know what kind of damage

258
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,830
sustained from having a building fall
out it.

259
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:21,160
You don't know what that diesel fuel
burning,

260
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,420
what it does.
This structure.

261
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,920
You don't know how they built the inside
of it.

262
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:25,300
Who knows?
It's weird,

263
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,520
but weird things happen when things
break.

264
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,020
That was his take on it,
but you can't say that that doesn't look

265
00:11:32,021 --> 00:11:33,640
like a controlled demolition and I
didn't.

266
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:35,390
I said it does look like a controlled
demolition.

267
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:38,410
The bodies that you can see,
the most controversial thing I've ever

268
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:41,710
said about nine slash 11.
I've never said once that I think that

269
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,020
the government engineered it or that it
was.

270
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,640
I think it's very possible that big
events happen and then people capitalize

271
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:51,970
on those events and then things happen.
Like the invasion of Iraq.

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,730
They were probably looking for an excuse
do it anyway,

273
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,160
but the idea that it was all one big
grand scheme to me seems ridiculously

274
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:00,450
unlikely.

275
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,770
Okay.
Let me this,

276
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:06,480
this was actually a good segue into um,
what we started to talk about,

277
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:09,480
which was this,
this inclusion that I have your back in

278
00:12:09,481 --> 00:12:13,350
this rise list of top celebrities
promoting pseudoscience.

279
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,850
Because what?
It's.

280
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,120
If someone had just listened to our last
five minutes here of the exchange,

281
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,630
it sounded like you were trying to
convince me that nine slash 11 was a

282
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,920
hoax to who were there.
Who would say that?

283
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,880
I think anyone who listens to that five
minutes,

284
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,560
it would sound like you were trying to
convince me.

285
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:30,180
Building seven was a demolition.
No,

286
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:31,014
it wouldn't.
Okay.

287
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,500
I was very specific that I don't think
it's grayer.

288
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,990
I don't think it's a black and white
issue.

289
00:12:35,991 --> 00:12:39,530
I think it's a very gray area.
I think that that building looked like

290
00:12:39,531 --> 00:12:40,990
it was demolished.
Was it demolished?

291
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,070
I absolutely don't know.
I'm too dumb.

292
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,240
I have zero education when it comes to
structural engineering zero education

293
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:51,380
when it comes to the damage that a fire
can do to a structure and caused it to

294
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,420
collapse and big chunks of buildings
hitting it.

295
00:12:53,421 --> 00:12:54,710
What that can do,
I don't know,

296
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,930
but when I look at it,
it looks like a controlled demolition.

297
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,230
That does not sound like I'm trying to
convince you that nine slash 11 was a

298
00:13:00,231 --> 00:13:03,770
hoax because I said very specifically
that I don't think it is,

299
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:07,760
and then I think that it's ridiculous to
assume that someone could be so

300
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,440
organized that they could talk these
guys into flying planes into buildings

301
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,990
and that they can make it,
that these buildings are rigged with

302
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:19,991
explosives secretly and some clandestine
operation with the banks and the NSA and

303
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,300
the dea and the CIA.
Everyone coordinating together so that

304
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,330
we could invade Iraq.
It sounds ridiculous

305
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,760
if you're a betting man.
If you had to bet yes or no.

306
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,040
Was nine slash 11 orchestrated by the
government?

307
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,630
If you had to bet,
would you bet on?

308
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:34,130
No,
not 100 percent,

309
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,410
but I will present that on them 100
percent,

310
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:37,244
but I know,
but

311
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,230
I wouldn't be surprised if two,
two additional possibilities.

312
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,740
One,
it was something that they knew possibly

313
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,830
could happen.
It didn't prevent against because either

314
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:51,850
of a and competence or b,
you have to look at things like

315
00:13:51,851 --> 00:13:54,670
operation northwoods.
You have to look at the Gulf of Tonkin.

316
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:56,740
You have to look at real events that
took place,

317
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,610
meal plans,
that were questions.

318
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,940
Those are separate questions I would
say.

319
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:05,000
I would say there's always the
possibility that there was some

320
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,890
knowledge of it before,
but that.

321
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,190
But that's a separate question also.
Then they orchestrated it and caused it

322
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:12,050
to happen.
I do not have enough faith that the

323
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,440
government is so competent that they
could pull off this amazingly intricate

324
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,090
attack.
So if you're 100 percent,

325
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,710
if you're 100 percent betting,
no question.

326
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,480
So that means I might bet no,
but it doesn't mind that I'm asking for

327
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:26,090
your personal level of confidence,
your opinion and your personal.

328
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,380
If you're forcing me to bet,
then I would bet no,

329
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,800
I never say I know one way or the other.
So if I asked you what is your bet on

330
00:14:33,801 --> 00:14:36,350
whether building seven was a controlled
demolition,

331
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,120
are you still 100 percent?
No,

332
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,300
I certainly wouldn't bet.
I certainly wouldn't bet because I don't

333
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:43,310
know enough.
But if I looked at it the way,

334
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,230
the way,
uh,

335
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,040
a person who's objective,
a person who understands what they know

336
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:52,010
and what they don't know in this life,
I would to say it

337
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,160
would be pretty fucking difficult to rig
a building with explosives and not have

338
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,740
anybody know about it.
It was pretty fucking difficult to make

339
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,340
that building implode and have it be
some sort of a secret that people kept.

340
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,330
It seems highly unlikely.
It seems more likely to me that there's

341
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,600
some sort of a catastrophic structural
failure.

342
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,100
But I would fucking sue the shit out of
those people that built that movie,

343
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,510
that,
that building rather.

344
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,360
If I was Larry,
what's his name that had a lateral

345
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:20,060
Silverstein,
I would sue the fuck out of the people

346
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:21,230
that built that building.
I was like,

347
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,750
look at this building.
Just fall down when it gets on fire like

348
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:25,880
you assholes.
I guess he got paid though from

349
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:26,481
insurance,
right?

350
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:28,750
He didn't need to do that.
If you didn't get that.

351
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,950
Part of the conspiracy is that money was
made off.

352
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,060
The conspiracy,
the words,

353
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:32,990
the wording,
pull it,

354
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,800
pull it out.
The fact that you said pull it,

355
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:40,010
it's my my take that anytime there's a
any sort of a catastrophic event,

356
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,830
whether it's a murder or an accident or
anything,

357
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,850
there's a bunch of people that look for
patterns in the chaos.

358
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,880
There's a bunch of people that look for
a following plot line and look for some

359
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:56,390
sort of nefarious connections between
people that would profit off this event

360
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:00,320
and just the randomness of of chaotic,
of being attacked,

361
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,760
of of death and about destruction.
I think it's more likely that it's more

362
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:08,960
likely that people are looking at this
and trying to make some sense out of it,

363
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,810
but this crazy chaotic event where
there's a bunch of suicide bombers,

364
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,880
flew planes into a building.

365
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,310
Things you know when?
When Neil Tyson was here.

366
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,350
How long ago was that?
Three,

367
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,500
four months ago.
Something like that.

368
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,970
It's about a year ago.
Okay.

369
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,050
He was.
He was.

370
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,150
He was making the point about how he
tries very much to give people the tools

371
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,360
to.
You can't teach everyone all the facts,

372
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:32,360
but you can give people the tools so
that they can probably figure out what's

373
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:33,890
true,
what's not true,

374
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:36,830
and he made some points about why that's
a valuable thing to have,

375
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:40,700
why it's good to have to be able to make
good decisions about the way the world

376
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,860
works and to understand the way things
really happen.

377
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,200
And it sounded to me like you've pretty
generally agreed with him.

378
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,940
Yes.
And I would too.

379
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Um,
so in the case of this nine slash 11 as

380
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:54,141
a,
as an example,

381
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:56,210
I mean we've got 100 different
conspiracy theories here,

382
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:56,930
et Cetera,
et cetera.

383
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,410
And not even conspiracy theories,
but just playing up pseudosciences it

384
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:04,850
makes just,
it makes sense to help people to come to

385
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,650
the right conclusion to come to a
conclusion.

386
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,800
That's probably true because that's
symptomatic of all the other areas in

387
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:13,310
their life where they're going to have
to consider issues and make up a good

388
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,400
informed opinion.
That's probably more likely to be true.

389
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,170
Wouldn't you agree with that?
I mean,

390
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,910
that's really the same thing he's
saying.

391
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:25,210
So if it then makes sense for you to to
to promote the idea that nine slash 11

392
00:17:27,621 --> 00:17:30,470
was probably not a government
conspiracy,

393
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,280
then why would you spend five minutes
showing me this video and bringing it to

394
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:34,570
the,
to,

395
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:35,990
to,
to the attention of everyone on your

396
00:17:35,991 --> 00:17:36,711
show saying,
hey,

397
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:38,570
look at this.
Look how it was probably a controlled

398
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:41,120
demolition look.
I'm sorry.

399
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,000
Look how much it looked like a
controlled demolition because it does.

400
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,830
Because it's interesting.
Yeah,

401
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,070
but unless you're framing that within
the context of look

402
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,520
how easy it is to be mistaken,
which is not what you said,

403
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,591
but why?
Why?

404
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:56,820
Why do I have to do that?
And to just observe something that's

405
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:59,400
fascinating.
You don't have to do it,

406
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,940
but what Neil was Tyson was trying to
sell you on was the value of doing it.

407
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,130
Help.
Giving people the tools to understand

408
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,530
the way the world probably actually
work.

409
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,070
How does that relate to you?
Listening to me go on about how it looks

410
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,610
like a controlled demolition.
You agree that it looks like a

411
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,750
controlled demolition and just because
I'm expressing that,

412
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,610
you're saying that if someone listened
to that,

413
00:18:17,611 --> 00:18:20,850
they think they would think rather than,
I'm trying to convince you that nine

414
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,430
slash 11 was a hoax.
I think that's a giant stretch.

415
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,090
It I,
I think that's what it sounded like.

416
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,500
I think sound like that.
To me,

417
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,990
the most rational objective people
listening,

418
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:33,510
they would have heard all the caveats
that I threw in there all the times that

419
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,850
I said,
now I don't believe this.

420
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:38,840
I don't,
but looking at that and watching it

421
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:40,920
collapse like that,
it looks like a controlled demolition.

422
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:45,030
I think you'd be a fool to disagree.
It looks exactly like that.

423
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,040
Is it one?
That's not what I'm saying.

424
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,080
I don't know.
I've said very clearly.

425
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,660
I know nothing about architecture
architecture.

426
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,600
I know nothing about engineering.
I know nothing about the impact of

427
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,450
diesel fire on concrete and steel.
I don't know.

428
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,763
Okay.
Well,

429
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,490
let me go back again to how this is a
good segue to what I wrote back in 2000,

430
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,450
which hopefully the end result of me
being here today will be.

431
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,910
I will get back to all my listeners and
say,

432
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,630
I'm retracting your appearance on this
list.

433
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,560
Okay,
so just a paragraph.

434
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:14,971
You know.
Okay.

435
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:18,180
If I read this short,
so I think you were a number eight on my

436
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:21,990
list of top 10 celebrities who promote
harmful pseudoscience,

437
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,930
and here's the paragraph that I wrote on
you.

438
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,040
Number eight,
Joe Rogan,

439
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,690
comedian Joe Rogan does what he can to
promote virtually any conspiracy theory

440
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:34,600
that he stumbles onto apparently
accepting them all uncritically where

441
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,780
they wholesale embrace.
Now,

442
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:38,100
I know you would disagree with that.
Now,

443
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,970
of course it would and I want to give
you that chance so I'm me.

444
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,530
Continue.
He believes the Apollo astronauts did

445
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:46,590
not land on the moon.
He believes the US government was behind

446
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:50,190
the nine slash 11 terrorist attacks.
He believes the Oliver Stone version of

447
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,910
the Kennedy assassination.
He believes aliens crashed at Roswell in

448
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,610
1947 and the government is covering it
up.

449
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,500
He thinks men and black from project
blue book stole his friend's camera even

450
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,840
though project blue book ended over 38
years ago.

451
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,050
My friend was tanny 60,
by the way.

452
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,120
I didn't steal his Canada,
what to hear that story,

453
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:10,920
but they took it when he was a little
boy.

454
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,530
He took a photo of something.
Who knows what it was.

455
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,480
I never said it was project blue book
guys,

456
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,130
are they?
I told you what?

457
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:21,240
My friend who was a flight surgeon told
me I wish to hell I had that.

458
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,430
I had the reference for that,
but let me just fits.

459
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,870
Okay,
well that's part of the call Steve and

460
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:26,010
get them on the phone.
Steve Graham.

461
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,970
That'd be fun.
Actually,

462
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,570
the worst part is that he promotes these
ideas to the public at every interview

463
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:33,300
opportunity,
but gives himself the intellectual get

464
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:38,301
out of jail free card of not needing any
evidence by hiding behind the childish

465
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:40,440
debate technique of saying,
Hey,

466
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm just the guy asking questions.
God,

467
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:45,150
this makes me sound like an asshole.
Well,

468
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,830
it's just factually inaccurate on so
many different levels.

469
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:47,980
I don't

470
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,460
understand why you wrote it like that,
like there's things that you said that I

471
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,830
believe that I don't,
that I've never said that I do.

472
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,290
What I'm willing to do is look stupid
and by talking about things and saying

473
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,650
that looks like a controlled demolition.
I know that puts you in the the nutter

474
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:04,600
camp,
but I'm not saying it's a controlled

475
00:21:04,601 --> 00:21:07,660
demolition,
but I say that not being willing to

476
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:10,930
debate it and being insecure to discuss
it rather not debate it,

477
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,530
but to discuss the reality of what
you're viewing is silly.

478
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,500
It's preposterous.
It doesn't mean I'm promoting the idea

479
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:20,740
that nine slash 11 was an inside job or
that it was a plot by the government.

480
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,690
I don't think that.
I've never thought that,

481
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,390
but I do think that building looks like
a controlled demolition.

482
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,150
That's all.
I don't think there's anything wrong

483
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:28,984
with saying that.

484
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,210
I think.
I think at the time that I did this,

485
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,910
I think you had.
It was shortly after when you went on

486
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,300
Penn Jillette's radio show and talked
with Phil plait about the moon.

487
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,410
Remember that?
Sure.

488
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,570
And you kicked his butt.
Well,

489
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,920
unfortunately,
look,

490
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,860
I would not have handled that the way I
handle it then today,

491
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,850
but there's two unfortunates.
One was that I really wanted him when we

492
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,851
first went on to give me a reason to not
believe what this Fox documentary showed

493
00:21:57,341 --> 00:21:59,320
me,
but the more I talked to him,

494
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:03,340
the more I realized that he was almost
like talking in in a religious sense in

495
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:06,990
that he wasn't willing to criticize any
aspect of,

496
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,870
of NASA or any aspect of what was going
on during that time,

497
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,740
including the point where he was trying
to deny the fact that Werner Herzog or

498
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:18,700
Wernher von Braun rather,
and many other scientists were actually

499
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:22,070
Nazis that would come over and operation
paperclip and he's like,

500
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,710
you know,
he's trying to deny that there were

501
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:24,160
Nazis.

502
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,470
I'm like,
well,

503
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,980
this is crazy.
Like you're trying to deny historical

504
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,190
fat because you think that historical
fact shades NASA in a bad way,

505
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:33,840
and I don't think it does.
I think the NASA of 1969 or [inaudible]

506
00:22:33,841 --> 00:22:38,670
63 when Kennedy was in office is not the
NASA of 2013 or 14.

507
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,360
These.
These people are long dead and gone,

508
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,720
and to deny that there was a bunch of
Nazis involved.

509
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:47,140
Seems to me that's not healthy.
It seems to me like it's fucking with

510
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:49,510
the facts and it doesn't support your
argument.

511
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:51,040
In fact,
it makes me question all the other

512
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,810
stuff,
so then I started getting aggressive

513
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:53,531
with them because I'm like,
well,

514
00:22:53,531 --> 00:22:55,780
you're being silly because this isn't.
You're not.

515
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,210
You're not being honest about the Nazis.
You're not being honest about this

516
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,090
connection.
Okay,

517
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:01,630
well I got to throw that back at you.
What the hell does,

518
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:04,750
whether they're not twos or not have
anything to do with whether we went to

519
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,260
the moon?

520
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,070
Well,
it doesn't,

521
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,060
but denying the fact that there were
Nazis has something to do with what kind

522
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:13,450
of information I'm getting from him.
I'm not getting unbiased information.

523
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:13,991
Well,
I don't remember.

524
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:15,340
I don't remember that part of the
conversation,

525
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:18,600
but I remember that Wernher von Braun
had gone to Antarctica to pick,

526
00:23:18,601 --> 00:23:23,601
to collect rocks to collect meteors and
you brought that up and I think you said

527
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,740
words to the effect of why the heck
would he have done that?

528
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:30,520
Unless it was part of some grander
scheme to fake bringing rocks back from

529
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:31,660
the mood.
Am I correct about that?

530
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,650
I said,
well,

531
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,110
I said Wernher von Braun did go to
Antarctica.

532
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,150
You did.
When they were preparing for the moon

533
00:23:37,151 --> 00:23:38,620
landing,
and Phil Phil had no idea.

534
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:40,410
In fact,
I think he said he had never even heard

535
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,170
that fact when I was a lot of photos
online of Wernher von Braun and this big

536
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:44,650
crew.

537
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,850
There was one of the few places where
they could go.

538
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,310
They could study meteors that were
definitely from the moon.

539
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,600
Right,
and fill it,

540
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,400
fill.
It,

541
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,490
fills an astronomer.
He's not a space historian.

542
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,510
I understand.
He would have no reason to know that,

543
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,920
but why?
Why were you bringing that up?

544
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:59,240
What does that have to do with the
question?

545
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,670
Well,
the big conspiracy was of course that he

546
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:05,360
had brought these rocks back from there,
and then somehow or another,

547
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,430
those were the ones that they forged for
the moon rocks.

548
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,190
When they talked about where'd they get
these rocks from the moon?

549
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:11,960
Well,
there's absolutely meteors that came

550
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:14,150
from the moon that are in Antarctica.
You can find them,

551
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,630
they can retrieve them.
They've documented that so that the idea

552
00:24:17,631 --> 00:24:19,280
is that you have a chunk of the moon.
Here's,

553
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,930
here's the rocks we brought back from
the moon.

554
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,050
We want to know what to look for.
We want to know what their,

555
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,490
what kind of mass they've got,
things like that to how to,

556
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,010
how to make room for them in the
spaceship.

557
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,390
Yeah.
What they're made out of,

558
00:24:29,391 --> 00:24:32,450
what their contents are,
and as an alternative that could be seen

559
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:35,420
as being consistent with the moon
landing was exactly,

560
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,790
exactly.
What would you call it?

561
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:40,160
Evidence or would you call it consistent
with.

562
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,510
Or would you say those are the same
thing?

563
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:43,670
I wouldn't say it's evidence.
I mean,

564
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:44,504
look,
all you.

565
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,850
Let's say that they could land on the
moon.

566
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,750
Okay.
Let's say,

567
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:50,240
which by the way,
I believe now and let's say that,

568
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,580
uh,
they took spaceships and they went there

569
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:56,150
and they brought back moon rocks.
I think if you knew for sure that there

570
00:24:56,151 --> 00:25:00,140
were some moon rocks in Antarctica,
you would absolutely go there and study

571
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:00,650
them.

572
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,920
I don't think it's a bad thing,
but I do think that if you're a guy

573
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:08,780
looking for something that confirms your
suspicions of a of a conspiracy,

574
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:10,400
which I was,
I would say,

575
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:12,680
well look,
they went to get moon rocks and that's

576
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,640
[inaudible].
That's the big thing.

577
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:16,970
They always say they brought back x
kilograms of moon rocks where they get

578
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:18,380
those.
They went to Antarctica,

579
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,900
they got them from the Antarctica.
And look,

580
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,390
here's a photo of Warner von Braun in
Antarctica collecting moon rocks with a

581
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,160
fucking cast on his arm for some strange
reason.

582
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,420
How'd he break his arm?
Do you know?

583
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,370
I,
I didn't know that he had some old

584
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:31,850
school cast to mad.
Some fucking funky cartoon casts with

585
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,030
like a bar between them.
He must've really jacked his arm,

586
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,430
but they probably broke his arm to get
him to lie about going to the moon.

587
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,770
See,
I've got it all locked up.

588
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,440
Yeah.
Look,

589
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,171
I,
like I said,

590
00:25:42,171 --> 00:25:44,180
I wouldn't have,
I wasn't podcasting then.

591
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,390
And uh,
I certainly wasn't watching as many

592
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:48,920
documentaries and reading these many
books.

593
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,200
I wasn't.
I was in the middle of doing fear factor

594
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:54,410
in working for the UFC and I'd watched
this documentary on the Fox,

595
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,770
the Fox documentary on a conspiracy
theory.

596
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,010
Did we really go to the moon and it was
incredibly compelling,

597
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,430
especially if you're a retard like me
and you're watching Brian O'leary,

598
00:26:04,431 --> 00:26:07,790
who was an astronaut saying that he
could see that they could fake it and

599
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:10,980
you're watching bill casing.
It was the guy who worked at Rocketdyne

600
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,790
and he said that the engineers all agree
that no one could do this,

601
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,910
and then you look at the different
backgrounds that they showed in

602
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:20,420
different trips and they were basically
the same background,

603
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:21,560
but they were nowhere near each other.

604
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,320
They had done it.
They've done a really good job of

605
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:28,280
piecing together all this weirdness and
then do it with a narrator and spell it

606
00:26:28,281 --> 00:26:29,780
out for you and I bought it.
Hook,

607
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:30,830
line,
and sinker for sure.

608
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,190
The the real issue.
There's a bunch of real issues with

609
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:35,420
faking the moon lane.
Of course,

610
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,490
the numbers of people that would be
involved,

611
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:42,500
the amount of technology that you would
have to discount where people could

612
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:47,501
track lunar module as it went in the
lineage of creating the Saturn five and

613
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:51,450
how they see the stages of detached and
all the different mathematical

614
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:55,380
calculations they did create them,
but if you break it down to an hour

615
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,730
documentary for a dummy and you put some
spooky music in it and you keep cutting

616
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:01,980
back and forth to commercials,
you're going to believe that we didn't

617
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:02,760
go to the moon.

618
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,710
Yeah,
it's the easiest ID in the world to

619
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:09,360
sell.
Conspiracy theories are so just people

620
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,970
want to believe them.
They satisfy so much.

621
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,400
They're fun to fund.
It makes you feel like you've got some

622
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,830
secret insider information,
but there's also.

623
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:17,664
There was evidence that

624
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:22,490
NASA did fake some publicity shots.
They did from the Gemini Program,

625
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,640
Michael Collins,
they used a photo of him where he was in

626
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,700
a simulator and they used it and they
blacked it out and had the exact same

627
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:35,480
image and released it as a press photo.
So what is this deception?

628
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,580
Does that mean that there was deception
across the board?

629
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:40,700
No,
but I did this Saifai show and in the

630
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,870
middle of the Scifi show,
someone who is an editor took some

631
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:49,820
footage and spliced in some sound and
faked something and said that a user

632
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:54,560
centered in not to my knowledge and I
found out about it and freaked out and I

633
00:27:54,561 --> 00:27:55,071
said,
well,

634
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:56,570
when you fake one thing,
like we,

635
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,200
we spent this entire show trying to
figure out the truth about something and

636
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:02,900
you guys for dramatic effect faked one
thing,

637
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,040
you fucked up the whole show because
what you did is you cast doubt on

638
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,740
everything else this show is ever going
to say ever.

639
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,780
Like literally hast almost die right
here because you're the ethic of

640
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:18,080
creating a completely honest show has
already been gone.

641
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,880
It's already been washed away.
And when you watch something like the

642
00:28:22,881 --> 00:28:25,610
moon landing and you know,
you look at the,

643
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,290
these guys hopping around on the moon,
you kind of almost want it to be

644
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,420
bullshit.
Kind of like what they fuck.

645
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,830
They got to.
Come on man.

646
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:35,690
How the fuck you look up at the moon?
Have Fuck,

647
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:38,300
are they getting up there and then you
find shit like this where they show

648
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,430
these images of,
you know,

649
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,760
Michael Collins in the simulator and
then the exact image all blacked out

650
00:28:43,761 --> 00:28:46,030
background saying that he's actually in
space like,

651
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,980
oh,
he's in Spain.

652
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,760
Who's taken this picture of him in space
like this?

653
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,630
He's not in space.
This is the same image.

654
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,510
Like you guys lied.
So because of that,

655
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,220
NASA is,
they're not perfect.

656
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,210
They weren't perfect in the fact that
they hired a bunch of Nazis and brought

657
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:00,740
them over from,
from Germany.

658
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,230
They weren't perfect in the fact that,
you know,

659
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:07,670
I'm sure some people in the publicity
department told some tall tales and spun

660
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:11,360
some yarns and you know,
they had a makeup for Gus Grisham dying

661
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:14,090
in that simulator.
There's a lot of like horrible

662
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:16,820
publicity,
snafoos terrible things that went wrong

663
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:19,640
that eroded people's confidence in,
in NASA.

664
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:24,850
I could easily see a fake here or there
a photograph that was that was

665
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,770
staged here or there that they said
happened on the moon or that they said

666
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:34,430
happened in space.
I don't think that that means

667
00:29:34,431 --> 00:29:37,790
necessarily that the moon landing was
faked though then I did.

668
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,890
Yeah.
I mean it's,

669
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,030
it's,
it's pretty common piece of feedback

670
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,010
that I'll get when

671
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,010
I do an episode on any,
any given conspiracy theory and let's

672
00:29:45,011 --> 00:29:47,710
say it's one like this that involves the
government.

673
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,530
The,
the feedback that I'll get is so you

674
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:53,260
believe the government loves us and is
perfect and everything they do,

675
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,363
it's like,
oh,

676
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,990
it's not necessary for NASA to be
perfect for us to have gone to the moon.

677
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:02,380
It's not necessary for the government to
be perfect for nine slash 11,

678
00:30:02,381 --> 00:30:04,660
not to have been an incense.
The classic Straw man.

679
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,000
Black and white argument.
Yeah.

680
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:06,340
No,
it's.

681
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,640
You're either and that's exactly what I
said about the building collapsing.

682
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,300
It's basically the same thing.
It's not.

683
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:14,860
It doesn't mean that the government is
beautiful and perfect in every way

684
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:17,350
because they managed to go to the bone.
Agreed.

685
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,420
Yeah.
So should we go through this checklist

686
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:21,280
here?
Which of these I can take off?

687
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:21,940
Yeah.
What was,

688
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,660
what was the other one?

689
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,720
You had another one that I.
let's start with a violently disagreed

690
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:28,150
with it.
Was was the first one.

691
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh,
fascination.

692
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,670
Okay.
He believes the Apollo astronauts didn't

693
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,590
land on the moon.
That's gone.

694
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,400
Yeah.
Okay.

695
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,360
Yeah.
Okay.

696
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,560
That's good.
I'm checking it off.

697
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,470
I would love it if it was a hoax style.
If I found out that it was a hoax,

698
00:30:38,471 --> 00:30:40,910
I got to tell you right now.
I would love it almost more than I love

699
00:30:40,911 --> 00:30:43,540
the fact that people went to the moon.
I would love it if it was a hoax.

700
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:45,280
Capricorn won.
Best movie ever.

701
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,990
No,
it wasn't.

702
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,530
It wasn't even close.
It was a good movie,

703
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,260
but alien was the best movie.
Alien one,

704
00:30:50,261 --> 00:30:52,030
the first one in my opinion,
and it had,

705
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,750
it had the evil corporate government
conspiracy behind it.

706
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,280
Um,
I do not believe in knowledge over

707
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,480
stones,
in fact,

708
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,250
have criticized that film on this
podcast many times because Oliver stone

709
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:05,890
created in the Donald Sutherland
character.

710
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,640
They can use this vehicle for this
general that's giving him this

711
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:14,560
information in order to spell it all out
to the Kevin Costner character.

712
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:16,060
I've never said that.
You know what I've said.

713
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,500
I said,
if you look at that bullet,

714
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,850
it doesn't look like went through
people.

715
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,620
That's what I've said,
because if you look at the single

716
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:22,510
bullet,
it does not look like it penetrated

717
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:24,090
bone.
See that bones are.

718
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,300
You see that Scott?
I'm a hunter.

719
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,210
I'm an actual bonafide hunter.
I know what it looks like when bullets

720
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:32,140
hit meet and that that bullet does not
look like it went through to people.

721
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,070
Did you beat the fuck out of that thing?
Nice to save any.

722
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,830
I have some.
I'll get you some you like.

723
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:39,940
Do you like venison?
I love it.

724
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,140
I just got one in Wisconsin last month.
Relatives in Oregon.

725
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,260
They're sending us stuff all the time.

726
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,330
The best meat.
It's so delicious and so healthy and I

727
00:31:47,331 --> 00:31:50,080
like the fact that it's wild.
It's running around wild and then you

728
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:54,670
take it out of the mix,
but I've never said that Oliver Stone

729
00:31:54,671 --> 00:31:55,570
was right.
In fact,

730
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,880
I've said there was A.
I liked the movie,

731
00:31:57,881 --> 00:32:00,190
I think Kevin Costner and knocked it out
of the park.

732
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:03,610
I think it was an interesting movie,
but what I've like about it is that it

733
00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:07,240
opens up this idea where people start to
question what happened.

734
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:07,991
Okay.
I,

735
00:32:07,991 --> 00:32:11,650
I think what I,
what I meant by that statement was you.

736
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,070
You don't believe that Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone.

737
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,020
I do not believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted
alone.

738
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,880
No,
I think there's ample evidence that

739
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:21,850
there was other people involved,
but that doesn't mean that Lee Harvey

740
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,280
Oswald wasn't involved.
There's another black or white thing.

741
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:28,000
Everybody wants an either or.
I think it's very possible that Lee

742
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,380
Harvey Oswald was in cahoots with that
murder.

743
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,720
First of all,
Lee Harvey Oswald was on the scene.

744
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:35,590
Second of all,
Lee Harvey Oswald was known to be in bed

745
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:38,560
with all these fucking Weirdo characters
he had brought.

746
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,040
He had gone Russia and

747
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,390
brought back a woman and was allowed to
reenter the United States.

748
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,810
The fact that Jack Ruby got to Lee
Harvey Oswald and the really high

749
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:54,170
pressure situation,
she shot the fucking president and you

750
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:57,440
just have them wandering through with
this gangster can run up to them and put

751
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,600
a bullet in him.
It plays out like a movie,

752
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:02,240
so in fact,
so you've got a lot of anomalies that

753
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:07,241
are consistent with any conspiracy,
conspiracy and but my take on it is not

754
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,330
that I know or that I believe in Oliver
Stone.

755
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,970
My take on it is what a colossal strange
event,

756
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:19,210
a changing of us history,
a changing of the way we look at the

757
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,330
power of being a president,
a changing of the way we look at what

758
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:27,650
can happen to someone in this lifetime.
When someone who is so beloved as John F

759
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,560
Kennedy disappears off the face of the
earth and the world instantaneously

760
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:31,340
changes.

761
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,880
I think it's a fascinating story and I
also think it's fascinating how many

762
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:37,880
enemies he had.
You can't discount when you're talking

763
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:42,170
about people who were involved with
people who have created wars,

764
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,030
people who have absolutely been
responsible for the death of untold

765
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:49,730
thousands of people.
You can't discount the idea that they

766
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:51,980
would organize a coup.
I don't know if they did,

767
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,750
but I do know that that thing was one
colossal clusterfuck,

768
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,850
a crazy thing,
and that the fact that the film was held

769
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:03,851
back until her Waldo Rivera of all
people put it on television with Dick

770
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,000
Gregory who bought a lot of people,
don't even realize is a great comedian,

771
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:10,550
was a great comedian and an activist at
the time.

772
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,050
And it was way into the seventies that
Dick Gregory played this on Geraldo

773
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,820
Rivera show.
And you get to see Kennedy's head

774
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,410
snapped back.
And this router film.

775
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,680
I don't think that that means that
someone else did it.

776
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,860
I think it means there's probably more
than one person involved.

777
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,250
And when you look at the Warren
Commission report and you look at the

778
00:34:28,251 --> 00:34:30,680
inconsistency is in it.
There's a great book about it called the

779
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,100
best evidence by David Lifton,
who was,

780
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:35,450
um,
he was actually an accountant and was

781
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,980
hired to go over the Warren Commission
report and found inconsistency after

782
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:43,220
inconsistency over and over again,
and detailed these in great order.

783
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:47,960
But the difference in the inconsistency
of the autopsies and consistencies of

784
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,380
the various reports of what went down in
consistencies in the Warren Commission

785
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,600
of their findings that would cancel out
each other's findings.

786
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,320
He was one of the few guys were the
first guys to go through the entire 900

787
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:58,820
volumes.
Fascinating.

788
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:02,660
Fascinating book that I read when I was
living in New Jersey.

789
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:07,520
I was living in New York rather,
and it was doing a Gig on the road and I

790
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:10,040
read it and fucking bombed that night.

791
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,830
Oh my God.
It was in my hotel room all day reading

792
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:16,520
is freaky conspiracy books.
Shit in my pants and I was like 23 years

793
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:18,830
old.
And then I went on stage that night and

794
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,330
just had terrible and I learned a very
valuable lesson from that book.

795
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,830
Don't read or watch depressing shit
right before you go onstage or break

796
00:35:27,831 --> 00:35:30,600
into big conspiracy mongering in the
middle of your set that you just know.

797
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,530
Nobody came to conspiracy freak for sure
for sure.

798
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,320
That book best evidence was what threw
me over the top.

799
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:36,591
Well,
you know,

800
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:37,840
I did an episode on,
on,

801
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,070
on

802
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,750
the JFK assassination a about a month or
two ago and I'd been putting it off for

803
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:47,751
years because there is so much,
so much bs and so much real information

804
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,310
on that.
Then I found this is,

805
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,000
this is impossible.
How am I going to distill this into a 12

806
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:56,070
minute show because my son was 12
minutes,

807
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,040
12 minutes long every week.
That's insane.

808
00:35:59,041 --> 00:35:59,920
You need to spread out.
Yeah.

809
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,860
So what,
what,

810
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,320
um,
what I decided to do is not to address

811
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,030
any of the conspiracy theories,
but just talk about why in general,

812
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,390
the conspiracy theories
individual and myriad as they are,

813
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,590
why they don't stand up to,
you know,

814
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,570
what's,
what we,

815
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,770
what we,
um,

816
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,350
unfortunately called the official story
quote unquote,

817
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,420
kind of a weasel word.
Um,

818
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,210
and it really,
the thing is that what all conspiracy

819
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:32,211
theories have in common is that they are
united only in that they dispute the

820
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:33,930
official story.

821
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,610
For example,
you can say the,

822
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,290
the Cubans Killed Kennedy,
or you can say the Russians killed

823
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,510
Kennedy.
Or you can say the mob killed Kennedy.

824
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,510
Or you can say the secret service men
running alongside,

825
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:47,460
accidentally shot him,
whatever.

826
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,440
And all the people who promote those
conspiracies,

827
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,150
they,
they consider themselves united as a

828
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:58,980
group even though their theories are
absolutely factually exclusive of one

829
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:00,690
another.
Almost like competing religions.

830
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,140
They.
Yeah,

831
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,811
exactly.
They,

832
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:05,880
they cannot possibly be,
be brought together.

833
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,910
The only thing they have in common is
that they simply say the government's

834
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:11,250
lying.
And as long as you say the government's

835
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:12,120
lying than hey,
you're,

836
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,230
you're okay.
You're in the club.

837
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,100
Your theories.
All right?

838
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:17,130
Your theory is more likely that that's
the government to find out.

839
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:19,020
We're talking about this.
It's,

840
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,550
it's happened.
It's happened.

841
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,890
You right?
You know Vince Bugliosi his book.

842
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,470
I didn't like it.
What was it called?

843
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:31,370
Case closed case or whatever.
Okay.

844
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,660
Was called case closed.
He talked about,

845
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,960
I can't remember what it was called,
so I'll accept that in us.

846
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,250
We don't have to accept anything.
This is google.

847
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:43,200
He talked about one.
One person that he interviewed who

848
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,060
believed posner too.
Sterile pose.

849
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,470
Nurse case closed.
Okay.

850
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,690
He believes one person he interviewed,
um,

851
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,960
believed that Kennedy was still alive
and likely and that he had committed

852
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:56,280
suicide.
Uh,

853
00:37:56,281 --> 00:37:57,390
yes.
I heard the,

854
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,720
the secret service man shot him.
I heard A.

855
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:03,060
I heard like you could see him shoot him
on the,

856
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:04,410
on the video for that.
Okay.

857
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,770
The driver shot him.
Yeah.

858
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:07,040
Yeah.
The driver turned around.

859
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,770
So even,
even having,

860
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:15,270
even even one person having their own
belief that is self contradictory seems

861
00:38:15,271 --> 00:38:20,271
more likely than believing what the
government says and the government

862
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,660
obviously is not perfect,
but you can't.

863
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:28,080
You cannot say that just because the
government agrees with one particular

864
00:38:28,081 --> 00:38:30,960
version of events that that event is
therefore wrong.

865
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,580
You're right.
And that's a huge,

866
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,860
hugely popular argument that I get
reclaiming history.

867
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,110
Fascinating.
I didn't read this.

868
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:40,780
I read the other one.
You're right.

869
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,270
However,
it doesn't disclude the possibility that

870
00:38:43,271 --> 00:38:45,310
there was in fact some sort of a
conspiracy.

871
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,450
No,
it certainly doesn't,

872
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,630
but the fact that the,
that the government found one version of

873
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:53,530
the events more compelling and wrote
their official version on that doesn't

874
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,970
make that version of wrong.
You're right.

875
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,520
And that's the hardest.
That's the hardest point to communicate

876
00:38:57,521 --> 00:38:59,440
to the people who believe that it
certainly doesn't.

877
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:03,040
The inconsistencies that are troubling
in the Warren commissions are part are.

878
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,680
There's several,
but one of the big ones is the single

879
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:07,630
bullet theory or the need for the single
bullet theory.

880
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,930
The reason why they needed to formulate
the single bullet theory is because they

881
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:14,050
had an account for three shots.
They had a new bullet that it hit

882
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,310
ricocheted against the curbs,
term kerbstone on under the overpass,

883
00:39:18,311 --> 00:39:20,080
and a guy had gotten hit by the
ricochet,

884
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,590
so he was in the hospital and they had
seen the mark on the curb stone,

885
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:24,880
so they attributed that to a bullet.

886
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:25,901
So they say,
okay,

887
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:29,350
well we know for sure someone was
shooting from the direction the school

888
00:39:29,351 --> 00:39:30,700
book depository.
That's one thing.

889
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,990
Then that confirmed actually supporting
the idea that Oswaldo did it or that

890
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:37,990
someone in Oswald's position did it.
So bullet did come from there,

891
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,170
but now they had to account for all
these wounds and so how did they do

892
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:41,671
that?
Well,

893
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,461
instead of saying,
well,

894
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:45,550
maybe there was more than one bullet,
maybe there was more than three shots.

895
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:47,620
Maybe there was more than two people
shooting.

896
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,700
They had to come up with some sort of a
reason why one bullet could do all this

897
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:55,570
damage.
That to me seems a much less likely

898
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:57,850
scenario.
Then there's more than one shooter.

899
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,190
The more than one shooter.
If you're going to kill the fucking

900
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:03,910
president and if there is a conspiracy
and we haven't proven that there's not

901
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:06,400
more that there is,
but if there's going to be a conspiracy,

902
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:10,000
I would doubt you would give it to one
guy named Lee Harvey Oswald,

903
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,720
one guy and give them a rifle that's not
even that fucking good and put them in a

904
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:17,200
window and given this crazy shot that
most people are not going to make.

905
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,660
That's not a good shot.
If you've ever shot at something.

906
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,110
Moving targets are incredibly difficult
and moving targets.

907
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:25,780
When you're.
You have this shitty bolt action rifle

908
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,690
and you got to reload it.
It's a long time to do that.

909
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:31,180
You can get it off if you.
I mean,

910
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:34,360
I've seen the people that have pulled it
off in a test where they've said try to

911
00:40:34,361 --> 00:40:38,410
reproduce it and they can do it.
You can get those shots off and you can

912
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:39,850
do,
but you're not going to be accurate.

913
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:41,650
You need a couple of seconds to be
accurate.

914
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:43,630
You need your fucking shooting the
president.

915
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:47,470
This is not some low pressure situation.
This is the first person you've ever

916
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:51,970
assassinated with a rifle.
My position is that it's more likely

917
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:56,170
that they had a predetermined outcome
that they were trying to reach that

918
00:40:56,171 --> 00:41:01,171
outcome is that they wanted to tie up
everything with Lee Harvey Oswald and

919
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:02,650
one of the best ways to do that.

920
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,600
It's an attribute all these different
wounds to one bullet.

921
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,990
Does it mean that all those wounds were
not created by one bullet?

922
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,850
No,
because it's one of the weird things

923
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:13,540
that happens when you shoot things.
Things hit bone and they ricochet and

924
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:17,260
they go weird directions and strange
anomalies happen to bullets where a

925
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:19,060
bullet will kill someone and you'll look
at it.

926
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,190
It looks like it's virtually
undisturbed.

927
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:26,200
Every now and then shit gets weird,
but for the most part when a bullet goes

928
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:28,480
through to people and shatters bone and
both of them,

929
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:31,210
especially the risk of connolly on the,
on the end of it,

930
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:36,140
and then winds up in the Gurney in this
pristine form like the single bullet

931
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:39,080
theory did when they found that bullet.
That's unlikely.

932
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,080
I've got A.
I've got a 50 caliber round that that we

933
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:46,980
found in death valley leftover from the
days when they would do fighter planes

934
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,830
just shooting their machine guns over
from China Lake and what what it.

935
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,410
What it is is I'm a completely
flattened,

936
00:41:55,411 --> 00:42:00,060
smudged,
irreconcilable piece of copper and

937
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:05,180
protruding out from the center of it is
this absolutely pristine tungsten

938
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,920
missile that looks like it's fresh from
the factory,

939
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,200
absolutely sharp,
completely undamaged,

940
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,720
and it's inside this copper jacket that
is.

941
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,660
That's been peeled what?
Peeled away from it and completely

942
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,510
smashed out to to unrecognizable.
It's real effect.

943
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,730
When I found it,
we're looking at going,

944
00:42:23,731 --> 00:42:26,730
what the heck is this?
Is this a bullet that somebody shot into

945
00:42:26,731 --> 00:42:28,240
something and it's still hanging on?
Yeah,

946
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,620
so I understand what a really,
really weird stuff can go on with

947
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:33,420
bullets.
Weird stuff can go on with bullets.

948
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:35,220
One of my favorite paper,
so I have to talk about it.

949
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:36,201
Yeah,
I'm a,

950
00:42:36,201 --> 00:42:38,660
I'm a,
I'm really getting into ballistics

951
00:42:38,661 --> 00:42:40,160
lately.
I've been doing a lot of target shooting

952
00:42:40,161 --> 00:42:42,500
and talking to a.
I have a very good friend,

953
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:46,820
my friend Justin who is a,
a complete gun nut and if I have any

954
00:42:46,821 --> 00:42:49,280
questions about ballistics and,
and things,

955
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,300
I will talk to him about it.
And uh,

956
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,420
you know,
he'll tell you like weird shit happens

957
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,180
sometimes you shoot a person and the
bullet will come back at you through

958
00:42:56,181 --> 00:42:57,170
there.
I like,

959
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:59,390
that's happened to guys like guys and
special forces.

960
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,770
They've assassinated somebody or killed
somebody and the bullet hits bone and

961
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:05,930
somehow or another figures out a way to
pop out of their eye,

962
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,720
like slides around the inside of the.

963
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,050
Somebody's trying other somehow or
another ricochets in.

964
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,920
Well there's,
you know,

965
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,920
there's random weird shit that can
happen when you shoot people.

966
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,430
So is it possible that a bullet went to
Kennedy and then went into connolly?

967
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,620
Yeah.
One hundred percent weird shit happens,

968
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,780
but does it look like that bullet did
that?

969
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,100
Not at all.
No.

970
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,440
It looks like that bullet.
They fired into a tank of water.

971
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,980
That bullet doesn't look like it hit
anything because it's a lead bullet

972
00:43:30,981 --> 00:43:33,490
that's jacketed and the jacket isn't
bent.

973
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,260
It's not disturbed.
And to my knowledge,

974
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,410
people have tried to recreate that.
I know Penn and teller tried to do it.

975
00:43:39,411 --> 00:43:42,110
I think miss mythbusters tried to do it.
They weren't able to do it.

976
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,520
When they hit bone,
they were only able to do.

977
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:46,730
If they pass just through the flesh,
you can pass through flash and leave a

978
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:50,150
bullet relatively undisturbed,
but if you hit bone and you shatter that

979
00:43:50,151 --> 00:43:52,010
bone,
most likely you're making a mess out of

980
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:52,520
that bullet.

981
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,800
Didn't they find pieces in the body
also?

982
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,830
Absolutely.
In pieces in Connolly's wrist that did

983
00:43:57,831 --> 00:43:59,600
not match what was missing from the
bullet.

984
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,310
There was more pieces in connally's
body.

985
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:03,890
Then we're missing from the bullet.
Does that mean that he didn't get hit

986
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,724
with some,
you know,

987
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,390
random shrapnel and bullets are fucking
flying and weird shit happens and you

988
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:09,860
know,
there's a lot of weird shit that goes on

989
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:12,170
when you're in a gunfight,
but I think you would probably have to

990
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:13,640
attribute that to more than three
bullets.

991
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,720
Aliens in Roswell never said that.
In fact,

992
00:44:17,721 --> 00:44:22,721
have a joke goofing on it on my,
on my comedy special from 1999 where I

993
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,100
say that,
uh,

994
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,110
that people say the government actually
printed in the paper.

995
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:34,320
They have recovered a crashed Ufo and
alien bodies and the next day they made

996
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:35,240
a mistake up.
Sorry.

997
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,090
It was just a weather balloon.

998
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:36,631
Like,
well,

999
00:44:36,631 --> 00:44:38,640
what about the aliens?
Those are Mexicans.

1000
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,890
Apparently they were on the balloon.
They were drinking,

1001
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:43,380
some shenanigans took place.
They mistook the balloon for opinion.

1002
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,390
It's very tragic.
You know,

1003
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:48,660
I never said that.
I think that what I did say that is

1004
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,380
absolutely fascinating and fun thing to
think about.

1005
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,310
The fact that they could have found some
crashed ufo from another planet and

1006
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:00,270
hushed everybody up and hit these bodies
and little child's coffins run away with

1007
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:02,790
them,
but everybody that I've talked to that

1008
00:45:02,791 --> 00:45:07,410
has ever told me a story about being
abducted by Ufos are taken aboard a

1009
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:12,411
craft or any of their fucking crazy.
That's the one thing they all share.

1010
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,830
They all share this nutty disconnect
with reality.

1011
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,280
I've talked to people that have told me
some weird things about animals.

1012
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:23,070
I talked to a woman that was very
convincing that told me she had a

1013
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,110
bigfoot sighting,
very convincing,

1014
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,130
less shroud.

1015
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:30,090
Who's the survivor man told me some
animal was by beetles running through

1016
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:33,360
the woods and that,
but as far as you iphones,

1017
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,340
I'm still waiting for the one guy who
tells me anything that makes sense.

1018
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,960
I got in a hundred arguments with people
when I was filming the Scifi show that

1019
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,240
were believers.
When I was asking them for evidence.

1020
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:45,661
I was like,
well,

1021
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:48,270
where's the evidence?
Like we have sworn affidavits.

1022
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:49,770
I go,
that's not evidence.

1023
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,521
I go,
he goes,

1024
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:52,050
that is evidence.
That's evidence in a court of law.

1025
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:53,970
You can convict people for murder unless
I go,

1026
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:55,280
that's not scientific evidence like,
Oh,

1027
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,570
you have a story.
That's all you have is a story.

1028
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,240
Nobody wants there to be aliens more
than me,

1029
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,800
but all I see when I go looking for
aliens is a bunch of unfuckable white

1030
00:46:04,801 --> 00:46:09,801
dudes with stories about spaceships and
flying saucers and all sorts of things

1031
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,300
that make their regular,
mundane,

1032
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:17,040
boring life seem insignificant because
of this greater threat,

1033
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,620
greater mystery,
greater enigma,

1034
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:22,440
this huge thing that's going on where we
being observed by aliens.

1035
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,340
It adds this excitement to an otherwise
mundane life.

1036
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,960
And does that mean that there are no
aliens?

1037
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:30,000
Absolutely not.
Does it mean that aliens aren't

1038
00:46:30,001 --> 00:46:31,950
observing us?
Absolutely not,

1039
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,270
but it does mean is that the consistency
that I've found in talking to people

1040
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:39,750
that claimed to vet alien experiences
make me think that the aliens are so

1041
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:42,030
intelligent that they only picked
dummies.

1042
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,780
They're so intelligent that they pick
people that were easily discounted.

1043
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,060
So you listened to their stories and go,
go ahead.

1044
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,890
Tell somebody who the fuck is going to
believe you.

1045
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,110
You're crazy.
So they find people that have a problem

1046
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:54,460
with the truth and then abduct them.
That's,

1047
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,530
that's the only thing that makes sense.
How would you call your.

1048
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,370
Would you describe yourself as a science
advocate?

1049
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,170
One hundred percent?
Yes.

1050
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,200
I'm a huge fan of science.
It's one of the things that I forgot to

1051
00:47:04,201 --> 00:47:06,750
argue with Stefan Molyneux when he was
on the podcast recently.

1052
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,110
Not argued,
but he argues against funding,

1053
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,080
scientific research and space
exploration.

1054
00:47:12,081 --> 00:47:15,870
And to me it is,
it fuels my day if I get up in the

1055
00:47:15,871 --> 00:47:18,570
morning and I read about some new thing
that they're doing where,

1056
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,380
I mean even I've been following this
idea of putting a man mission on Mars

1057
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,870
and these people that are going to have
to go there on is one way trip and my

1058
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,890
fucking hands sweat just thinking about
it.

1059
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,070
Those things fuel my day.
I'm by science,

1060
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,960
absolutely fascinated by science.

1061
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,580
I the,
the thing that I love,

1062
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,870
um,
uh,

1063
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,820
doing,
doing the scaphoid episodes,

1064
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:43,821
my favorite part of it is solving the
mysteries that people usually leave

1065
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:48,870
unsolved because they stop at the
paranormal explanation.

1066
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,770
For example,
the whole Williamson Roswell,

1067
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,800
take that as an example.
If you take the national enquirer

1068
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:59,010
version of events,
it's sensational and it's fun.

1069
00:47:59,011 --> 00:48:00,690
Aliens are here,
aliens or visiting us,

1070
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:02,490
the government's coming here,
but it's got all of that,

1071
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:05,070
all the compelling qualities of a story
that we love,

1072
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:08,760
but the fact is that those people
haven't solved the mystery and what I

1073
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:13,040
enjoy most is completing the process,
going all the way through it actually,

1074
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,780
you know,
actually finding the pot of gold at the

1075
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,520
end of the rainbow.
Actually finding the solution to what

1076
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:18,080
happened

1077
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,390
whenever possible,
well isn't what makes it exciting to

1078
00:48:20,391 --> 00:48:23,090
these people that you never really can
do that unless you can get a time

1079
00:48:23,091 --> 00:48:25,640
machine and go back to Roswell,
New Mexico in 1940.

1080
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:26,390
What is it?
Seven?

1081
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:27,223
Was it seven,
nine,

1082
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,080
47 years?
I have the actual front page of the

1083
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:33,170
Roswell daily record on my home framed.
Oh,

1084
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:34,400
do you?
Very cool.

1085
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,740
It's fascinating.
What's also fascinating historically,

1086
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:38,930
just to look at all the other things
that were in the news that were stories

1087
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:41,240
and try to picture yourself living at
this time,

1088
00:48:41,241 --> 00:48:43,880
and I'll 70 years ago.
It's weird 77 years ago,

1089
00:48:43,881 --> 00:48:48,881
but the other thing that's weird about
it is that you can't go back so you

1090
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:51,290
can't know.
You got a bunch of different people and

1091
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:55,370
some of them tell you they saw aliens.
Someone tell you to say bodies and Max

1092
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,150
Roswell's,
Maxwell,

1093
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,530
Brazel,
whatever the fuck his name was,

1094
00:48:57,531 --> 00:49:00,380
swingers and all these different people.
And then you'd see the press conference

1095
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:02,180
where they have this to look.
It's just this stuff,

1096
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,450
you know,
it's so delicious to think in terms of

1097
00:49:05,451 --> 00:49:09,860
conspiracy to think in terms that the
government has this unbelievable magical

1098
00:49:09,861 --> 00:49:12,590
information that they're not sharing
with us because they don't think that we

1099
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:17,591
can handle it and it becomes this thing
that makes every average everyday life

1100
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:18,554
more exciting.

1101
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,960
And in on that same vein in the question
of going all the way back to building

1102
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:26,820
seven,
for example.

1103
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,220
Um,
to me,

1104
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,920
let's say,
let's say,

1105
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:34,650
I don't think it is an open question,
but let's say the open question of

1106
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:36,110
whether it was a,
a,

1107
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,390
a government conspiracy or not,
let's say we're just going to leave that

1108
00:49:39,391 --> 00:49:40,224
unsettled.
Okay.

1109
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,153
We don't know,
maybe,

1110
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,210
maybe it was,
maybe it wasn't,

1111
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:46,980
but to me what's really interesting
about that is the underlying science is

1112
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:51,330
how would a building made of steel and
covered with concrete or whatever it was

1113
00:49:51,331 --> 00:49:53,250
made of,
how would that melt,

1114
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:57,900
why would it collapse and understanding
the actual scientists to me,

1115
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,300
far more interesting than simply doing
this anomaly hunting that,

1116
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,390
that is so much more popular and trying
to point fingers and turn it into a

1117
00:50:06,391 --> 00:50:08,040
whole political,
ideological thing.

1118
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,660
Absolutely.
What is your background?

1119
00:50:09,661 --> 00:50:10,950
What is your education?
And uh,

1120
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,670
my,
my back,

1121
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,710
my background is in computer science
and,

1122
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:14,261
but uh,
I,

1123
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,230
I never,
I never really worked in the field.

1124
00:50:16,231 --> 00:50:17,890
I was um,
um,

1125
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,740
I did software consulting basically for
most of my career until I became a

1126
00:50:22,741 --> 00:50:25,050
science writer about the six,
seven years ago.

1127
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:29,150
How would you feel if someone with no
software knowledge whatsoever started

1128
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,760
criticizing software development that
you were involved with?

1129
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:33,080
If they were,
say like an architect?

1130
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,580
Since I was always really bad at it.
I

1131
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:44,120
know I would say just as you expect,
I'd say,

1132
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,760
well,
I probably know better than you do right

1133
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,890
now.
When you see architects and engineers

1134
00:50:48,891 --> 00:50:51,410
for nine slash 11 truth.
When you see this group of people,

1135
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,110
how many architects are involved?
Brian Google that shit.

1136
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,850
Architects and engineers from nine slash
seven.

1137
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,440
Truth.
There's a substantial number of people,

1138
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:01,400
but unfortunately it's something of the
people who actually are in that field

1139
00:51:01,401 --> 00:51:03,110
and most of them are not.
Um,

1140
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,010
it's a tiny fraction of a percentage of
all the people who work in that period

1141
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:07,844
overall.
Right?

1142
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,850
So if you're trying to look at what most
architects and engineers say,

1143
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:13,520
overwhelmingly,
they have no problem with quote unquote

1144
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,870
theater,
honestly,

1145
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,570
that it's been studied by most

1146
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:18,250
architects and engineers.
And again,

1147
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,410
just for the record,
again,

1148
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,690
I'm not,
I don't believe in a conspiracy to for

1149
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:24,040
nine slash 11.
I never have.

1150
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:25,590
But I'm saying that,
you know,

1151
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,930
this is kind of throws in the face of
what you said,

1152
00:51:27,931 --> 00:51:30,460
like these are educated people,
they were trained as architects and

1153
00:51:30,461 --> 00:51:32,200
engineers and they have this,

1154
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:37,200
this issue with building 72,000,
134 architects and engineers.

1155
00:51:37,391 --> 00:51:39,160
That's kind of a lot.
I will say this,

1156
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:44,220
the people who have spent the most time
on the question are overwhelmingly

1157
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:49,530
believers in the conspiracy of course,
but whereas the causal relationship

1158
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:53,110
there,
it's not that they spent most time

1159
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,740
learned the most information and then
made a rational decision based on what

1160
00:51:56,741 --> 00:51:58,390
they learned.
It's the other way around.

1161
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,530
They spend time obsessing with it
because they were ideologically married

1162
00:52:02,531 --> 00:52:03,730
to the idea from the very beginning.

1163
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:07,830
If you say that that dismisses them and
that's a good thing to say if you try to

1164
00:52:07,831 --> 00:52:09,940
dismiss them,
but I don't think you know them and I

1165
00:52:09,941 --> 00:52:13,480
don't think you've really examine why
they came to these conclusions or why

1166
00:52:13,481 --> 00:52:16,780
they were interested in interested in
investigating it in the first place.

1167
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,530
Well,
this is what I do for a living is I talk

1168
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:20,050
to the stand.
I understand that,

1169
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:23,320
but what I'm saying is I know you didn't
interview 2000 people.

1170
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,290
He didn't ask all those different guys,
so the say that in a blanket general

1171
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:30,040
statement that this is the reason why
they came to this conspiracy is a little

1172
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:30,480
disengaged.

1173
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,170
He was absolutely.
Generalizations are always wrong.

1174
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:38,760
I think that's a real issue and I think
that's what we're dealing with here.

1175
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:42,420
Where you had this reluctance to accept
the fact that I wasn't saying that nine

1176
00:52:42,421 --> 00:52:45,330
slash 11 was an inside job just because
I was saying tower seven looks like a

1177
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:46,470
demolition.
It's the same thing.

1178
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,650
Like if I listened to this,
I would think that you're trying to

1179
00:52:49,651 --> 00:52:50,490
convince it.
No,

1180
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,780
no,
it's not.

1181
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,720
It's not a black and white issue.
There's a lot of weirdness.

1182
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,600
There's a lot of weirdness in the world
and there's a lot of weirdness and

1183
00:52:57,601 --> 00:52:59,940
perception.
There's a lot of weirdness in people

1184
00:52:59,941 --> 00:53:02,040
that are educated but are also
incorrect.

1185
00:53:02,041 --> 00:53:04,380
It's a common thing.
It happens all the time and you're

1186
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:09,381
absolutely correct at 2000 people out of
what number of vast number of architects

1187
00:53:09,781 --> 00:53:13,140
and engineers there exists in the world,
but the real question is how many of

1188
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:16,050
those other people that exist have
examined this as thoroughly as these

1189
00:53:16,051 --> 00:53:18,270
people and you're right,
the ones that would examine it,

1190
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:20,520
the ones who are looking to find some
sort of conspiracy,

1191
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,010
does that mean they're wrong?
Well,

1192
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,410
in this case,
you and I both believe that they're

1193
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:27,360
wrong,
but that doesn't mean they're wrong.

1194
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:28,070
Well,
there's.

1195
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,940
There's not a lot of people
realistically who work in the field of

1196
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:34,330
failure analysis for building structure,
but those who do,

1197
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,710
my guess is,
and people can call in and tell me I'm

1198
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:39,940
wrong.
Shouldn't no one can call in.

1199
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:41,630
We shouldn't.
That's not good.

1200
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,380
That's my,
my.

1201
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:47,350
My supposition is that is that the
people who work in building analysis,

1202
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,230
failure analysis of buildings had no
problem with what they saw happening on

1203
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,720
telly.
I wouldn't guess that that's going to go

1204
00:53:52,721 --> 00:53:54,550
on Jesus.
They didn't need to.

1205
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:55,770
Well,
because I mean it's,

1206
00:53:55,850 --> 00:53:59,380
it's clear if you just watch any
documentary on the,

1207
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,720
on how the structure collapsed.
Well,

1208
00:54:01,721 --> 00:54:02,660
if those people that

1209
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:06,280
believe in the engineers and architects
for nine slash 11 truth created a

1210
00:54:06,281 --> 00:54:09,040
documentary,
maybe it would be convincing in the

1211
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:10,260
other way.
You know what I mean?

1212
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,010
It really depends on what perspective
you're coming from when you were

1213
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:18,490
uneducated about the subject as you are.
I were kind of crazy and making a

1214
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:19,630
conclusion one way or another.

1215
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,370
Okay.
That's true.

1216
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:25,540
But I mean there's a certain amount of
information that's widely available

1217
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,570
about how the building was constructed
according to those guys,

1218
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:31,150
according to the people who make it
widely available.

1219
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,650
Who knows?
Who really built the building.

1220
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,900
They built those buildings in New York.
That's a part of the problem.

1221
00:54:34,901 --> 00:54:38,170
They're skimping on the concrete and
fucking Joey,

1222
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,410
what's up with this old rebar?
The thing's going to fall down during a

1223
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:44,550
generalization about New Yorkers here,
but my people come.

1224
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,630
The dirt.
She stay down.

1225
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,343
No,
I

1226
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,820
what my issue with all this is is that
you,

1227
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,220
you,
you came to this,

1228
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:58,660
this instant conclusion that I probably
would have reached as well about me

1229
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,370
about certain subjects.
Well,

1230
00:55:00,371 --> 00:55:02,740
if he believes as he probably believes
that if he's discussed this,

1231
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,600
then he believes that if he's discussed
that,

1232
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,270
then he believes that he's promoting
dangerous pseudoscience,

1233
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,570
but I'm not.
I mean I certainly have promoted a

1234
00:55:10,571 --> 00:55:13,420
nonsensical idea in that we never went
to the moon,

1235
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,050
but it was based on a lot of really
fascinating,

1236
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:20,050
weird pieces of evidence that are really
amazing.

1237
00:55:20,051 --> 00:55:23,980
Once you start going down that rabbit
hole and following them and watching

1238
00:55:23,981 --> 00:55:27,970
the,
the Neil Armstrong speech that he gives

1239
00:55:27,971 --> 00:55:31,150
the 25 year anniversary speech where he
talks about removing truths,

1240
00:55:31,151 --> 00:55:36,070
hidden layers and all this weird cryptic
shit that he did and then all the shit.

1241
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:39,400
When you're looking at the videos of
them bouncing around where it looks like

1242
00:55:39,401 --> 00:55:40,390
they're on trampolines.

1243
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,750
If you're inclined to be conspiratorial,
it's all there for you.

1244
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:47,710
The speech from President Clinton's book
where he talks about when he was working

1245
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,930
with a carpenter,
when the first moon landings took place

1246
00:55:49,931 --> 00:55:51,340
in the carpenter,
told them that he didn't believe

1247
00:55:51,341 --> 00:55:53,710
anything.
Those TV fellers said that they could

1248
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:55,450
show they could fake anything and put it
on TV,

1249
00:55:55,451 --> 00:55:56,950
and he said,
back then I thought that guy was a

1250
00:55:56,951 --> 00:55:59,710
quack,
but during all my years in the White

1251
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,240
House,
I started to think maybe he was just

1252
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:02,530
ahead of his time.
That's,

1253
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:04,390
that's Bill Clinton in his book said
that.

1254
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,600
So if you conspiratorially minded,
you start looking,

1255
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,770
you know,
confirmation bias.

1256
00:56:08,771 --> 00:56:10,720
You start looking for things to confirm
your idea.

1257
00:56:10,721 --> 00:56:12,340
Look at these intersecting shadows,
man.

1258
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,400
You know,
look at this picture.

1259
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:15,370
Pictures fake.
Even if that picture is fake,

1260
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,204
it still doesn't mean

1261
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,770
go to the moon and consequently,
if you're inclined to think that nine

1262
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:23,590
slash 11 was a government conspiracy,
you're going to be of the people who

1263
00:56:23,591 --> 00:56:23,980
spends the

1264
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,050
most time,
quote unquote studying it,

1265
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,390
which really makes means reading the
same stuff that confirms your belief on

1266
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,240
the Internet.
Most likely.

1267
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:35,050
Or you could be someone who's absolutely
obsessed with proving that nine slash 11

1268
00:56:35,051 --> 00:56:37,030
was not an inside job,
and you could,

1269
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:42,100
you can chase that down and look at the
conspiracy of confirmation bias that

1270
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,310
resulted in all these crazy books and
documentaries and all these different

1271
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,920
things where people came to these
erroneous conclusions.

1272
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:50,440
Who spends the most time looking at
pictures of Ufo

1273
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:54,750
pilots,
astronomers or asleep checks.

1274
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,250
Get a couple more of these.
Um,

1275
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,253
yeah.
Um,

1276
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,320
I would imagine it's people that are
obsessed and I would imagine that a lot

1277
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:07,660
of those people were obsessed.
They are entertaining unhealthy ideas.

1278
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:09,550
Okay.
Now that's what I said though,

1279
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,820
a minute ago when we were talking about
architects and engineers on nine slash

1280
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:14,950
11,
and you kind of jumped on my logic,

1281
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:15,580
but that's not the.

1282
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,380
But that's different.
We're talking about people that are

1283
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,570
observing it,
not people who are trained in that

1284
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:21,850
field.
When you get 2000 plus 2000,

1285
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:23,620
100 people that are trained in that
field.

1286
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,100
Me personally as a non architect and
non-engineer,

1287
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,050
I have to look at it a little bit
differently.

1288
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,270
There's,
there's nobody more trained in Ufo log

1289
00:57:31,271 --> 00:57:32,300
than you.
Apologists.

1290
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:32,481
No,
no,

1291
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:32,740
no,
no.

1292
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,020
Me.
I am the most trained in,

1293
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,940
in euphology.
You don't even know.

1294
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:39,100
I'm the guy.
If you have any questions to use this

1295
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:41,440
because I just got it.
Do you need a go to guy?

1296
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,610
I will give those guys ecstasy and
strippers and will,

1297
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:48,010
will cure all this.
Search in the skies.

1298
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,250
Bunch of unfuckable white dudes.
That's what we're dealing with,

1299
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,140
Brian.
That's the real issue.

1300
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,200
But you're right.
In some ways you're right in some ways

1301
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:59,950
and we agree in some ways and,
and I absolutely agree with you that

1302
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:04,000
I've been 100 percent irrational in the
past about certain things and also I get

1303
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:07,340
caught up when I get into a discussion
with something about like,

1304
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:09,010
like Phil plait with the Moon landings.

1305
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:12,280
I'll get caught up in trying to be
correct or I'll get caught up,

1306
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:15,420
caught up and trying to counter his
moves and treat it like it's a Jujitsu

1307
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:17,460
match.
You know what I mean?

1308
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:20,080
Why didn't you just make it a Jujitsu
match that weren't even in the room

1309
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:21,220
together?
We were in the room together.

1310
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:24,340
It probably would've worked out better.
He was on the phone and I was on the

1311
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:26,110
phone once.
I was in studio once.

1312
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,820
He was in studio once and we were on the
phone once.

1313
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:28,360
Okay,
look,

1314
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,670
let me ask you this question.
Are we on time,

1315
00:58:30,671 --> 00:58:31,501
by the way?
I have no idea.

1316
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:33,360
I know we can go as long as we wanted.
Um,

1317
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,510
we don't have a boss.
One of,

1318
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,770
one of the things that,
um,

1319
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,360
that I,
that I put in my,

1320
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,960
in my paragraph about you,
which I hope to,

1321
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:45,220
would love to completely redirect,
was a criticism of what you say so

1322
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:45,550
often.

1323
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,410
It's just that I'm just the guy asking
him questions.

1324
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,930
Shouldn't we be looking at this?
Shouldn't we be asking these questions?

1325
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:52,720
Am I saying that you.
Am I saying that right now?

1326
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:56,770
I have said that asking questions,
Joe Rogan questions everything.

1327
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,090
Oh yeah.
So,

1328
00:58:58,230 --> 00:58:59,350
right.
But when I'm.

1329
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,280
Well,
if you go,

1330
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:03,310
that's not a good example because if you
go over that,

1331
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:06,160
it's me destroying pseudoscience.
If you go over that show,

1332
00:59:06,161 --> 00:59:08,740
it's like I got attacked by more people
that fucking believe in chem trails

1333
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:11,650
because of that show,
explaining the actual science behind

1334
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:13,590
this.
The thing that I sent you with Rosanne

1335
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,250
where I explained the science behind jet
engines.

1336
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:19,480
Great job by the way.
I thought you did a wonderful job going

1337
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:21,570
and talking to Roseanne.
The chemistry.

1338
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:24,380
Well that's all credit to request from a
metal bunk.

1339
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,920
He was a software engineer and a
brilliant guy.

1340
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,520
Software engineering or business.
What was the Tony Hawk did?

1341
00:59:31,521 --> 00:59:35,990
Tony Hawk
epic games and you know,

1342
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:40,910
he sold his share in that and just
decided to debunk conspiracies and he's

1343
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:45,740
brilliant at you know,
and he breaks it down so eloquently on

1344
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:47,870
the show.
We brought them on the show to sort of

1345
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,500
establish the science behind contracts
and chem trails.

1346
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:52,710
So,
so my,

1347
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,840
my,
my point with the whole asking

1348
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,790
questions,
things and,

1349
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:58,440
and,
and the validity of saying that it goes

1350
00:59:58,441 --> 01:00:01,560
a lot toward the,
the idea of visit.

1351
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,680
Is it smart to debate questions of
pseudoscience?

1352
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,830
I guess right now what's happening is
Bill Nye is A.

1353
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:11,850
I'm not sure if it happened yet already,
but bill Nye is going to the creation

1354
01:00:11,851 --> 01:00:14,370
museum to debate creationists.
I know.

1355
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,180
I heard about that.
Yeah.

1356
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:19,080
Now there's that that triggers a lot of
pro and con thought in the,

1357
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,710
in the science communication business
because many of us,

1358
01:00:22,711 --> 01:00:25,470
myself included,
think that it does more harm than good

1359
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:29,070
because you're suggesting to anyone who
might be on the fence,

1360
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,940
you're suggesting to them that there is
a debatable question here.

1361
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:38,870
When you have something that is clearly
an established fact backed up by all

1362
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:43,920
available evidence and something that's
crazy and has no possible evidence for

1363
01:00:43,921 --> 01:00:44,754
it.

1364
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,400
We don't hold scientific debates about
that.

1365
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:50,520
Um,
we move forward with our lives and when

1366
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:53,790
you go out and you hold a debate,
when you agree to have a debate,

1367
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,950
you're going to convince anyone who's on
the fence.

1368
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,270
Oh,
maybe there is a question here that

1369
01:00:57,271 --> 01:00:59,970
needs to be looked at.
And in fact,

1370
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:00,863
uh,
I,

1371
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,270
I,
I think it's arguable that you do more

1372
01:01:03,271 --> 01:01:05,820
harm than good.
And so by the same token,

1373
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,850
I say that it's really possible when you
say,

1374
01:01:08,851 --> 01:01:10,830
Hey,
I'm just the guy asking questions about

1375
01:01:10,831 --> 01:01:12,630
building seven or whatever the subject
is,

1376
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:17,400
that you're potentially doing more harm
than good by suggesting that there is a

1377
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:19,710
questionable subject here.
Roswell,

1378
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:20,760
let's take for example.
Hey,

1379
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:22,170
I'm just thinking.
I asked him questions.

1380
01:01:22,171 --> 01:01:24,930
Isn't it strange that there were three
small bodies that needed coffins?

1381
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,720
Well,
let's start with the,

1382
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,010
the one one example.

1383
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:33,630
Um,
you think that potentially addressing a

1384
01:01:33,631 --> 01:01:36,570
reality,
a reality in the way something looks,

1385
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,410
that that could be dangerous,
that in somehow people could miss

1386
01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:43,080
through that,
misconstrue that for being support for a

1387
01:01:43,081 --> 01:01:45,690
conspiracy theory.
I think that when you take,

1388
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:50,430
when you ask questions and you make an
argument that says,

1389
01:01:50,431 --> 01:01:52,350
hey,
shouldn't we ask questions about this?

1390
01:01:52,351 --> 01:01:56,790
Which is the answer is usually yes.
But when it's on a matter of basically

1391
01:01:56,791 --> 01:01:59,700
settled science,
I think you're doing more harm than good

1392
01:01:59,701 --> 01:02:00,990
by suggesting,
hey,

1393
01:02:00,991 --> 01:02:03,900
shouldn't we question whether two plus
two equals four?

1394
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,990
Isn't it okay to ask,
does two plus two equals five?

1395
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,520
Well,
you know that there's massive

1396
01:02:08,521 --> 01:02:12,480
inconsistencies in the studies that were
done about nine slash 11 that a disputed

1397
01:02:12,481 --> 01:02:16,050
about like the free fall speed.
I know there's a lot of anomalies that

1398
01:02:16,051 --> 01:02:17,970
people will picked out,
but I wouldn't say that there's any

1399
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,250
inconsistencies.
The evidence

1400
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:23,970
when we talking about technic testable
evidence that you can hold in your hand.

1401
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,070
Well,
what I would mean by inconsistencies is

1402
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:30,290
things that anomalies is a better word.
Things that you don't usually find like

1403
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:33,000
buildings falling at free,
fall speed and then saying that is one

1404
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:36,220
second less than free fall speed.
All these things fuel the,

1405
01:02:36,221 --> 01:02:37,320
the,
the debate,

1406
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:39,270
all these things.
Get people excited about it,

1407
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:44,010
but to deny that these things exist,
I think is silly because then you fueled

1408
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,950
the conspiracy theories even more
because you're denying something that

1409
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:48,800
seems obvious to the eye.
The eye,

1410
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,700
the average person that looks at that
building says yes,

1411
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:52,350
that does look like a controlled
demolition.

1412
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:53,970
Does that mean it is?
No,

1413
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,100
it doesn't,
but to pretend that it doesn't look like

1414
01:02:56,101 --> 01:02:59,670
that is ridiculous to about 10,
that is not odd that it falls at free.

1415
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:02,640
Fall speed.
I'm not sure anyone is denying that.

1416
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:06,180
It looks like a.
The part of it you can see in the video,

1417
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,530
it does.
It looks exactly like a control.

1418
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:11,760
You criticized me for what you agree
with that it looks like a controlled

1419
01:03:11,761 --> 01:03:13,830
demolition discussing.
You know,

1420
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,110
that's not what.
That's not what I'm criticizing you for.

1421
01:03:16,111 --> 01:03:17,760
I agree that it looks like a controlled
demolition.

1422
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:20,460
That's not the question.
The question is whether it should be

1423
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,780
brought up now.
Well,

1424
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:22,780
I mean you're,
you're,

1425
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:24,730
we're sticking on this one example of
building seven.

1426
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,930
We haven't resolved it yet.
It's a good example because it's an

1427
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:31,770
example that you use as an example of
you thinking that if you listen to me

1428
01:03:31,771 --> 01:03:35,910
just describe what I see with my eyes
that it sounds to me like I'm supporting

1429
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:39,120
some sort of a conspiracy theory when
I'm 100 percent not.

1430
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,890
Okay.
Would you.

1431
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,610
It seems like you have topics that are
off limits and that like this discuss

1432
01:03:48,611 --> 01:03:51,580
something like that.
Even did it to look at the reality of

1433
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:55,210
the speed that it fell to Steven.
Bring it up is off limits.

1434
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:58,810
Even if you say,
I don't believe in the conspiracy,

1435
01:03:58,811 --> 01:04:02,060
but isn't it crazy that building looks
like a controlled.

1436
01:04:02,070 --> 01:04:05,260
The only reason that this is a difficult
example to talk about is because it's

1437
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:10,261
one that so ideologically charged,
right as his bill Nye talking about

1438
01:04:11,621 --> 01:04:12,920
creationism.
There's,

1439
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:16,060
there's really,
there's really nobody who's on the fence

1440
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:19,180
about that.
You're either a creation story or not.

1441
01:04:19,181 --> 01:04:20,920
I mean,
there might be some people who are on

1442
01:04:20,921 --> 01:04:22,540
the fence,
but there's a lot on me.

1443
01:04:22,541 --> 01:04:23,710
I don't quite buy it.
Well,

1444
01:04:23,711 --> 01:04:25,540
let's look at the numbers.
The Gallup poll,

1445
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:30,160
the most recent Gallup poll on the age
of the earth was more than 46 percent.

1446
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,100
Tell me more than 46 percent.
Think the earth is less than 10,000

1447
01:04:33,101 --> 01:04:33,934
years old.
I don't want to know.

1448
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,430
It's shocking.
Well,

1449
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,240
it's.
We know exactly where it comes from.

1450
01:04:37,270 --> 01:04:39,220
First of all,
how many of those people have been

1451
01:04:39,221 --> 01:04:41,860
exposed to actual science,
actual research,

1452
01:04:41,861 --> 01:04:44,140
actual data?
Someone who's really cosmetic,

1453
01:04:44,141 --> 01:04:47,740
like a neil degrasse Tyson,
who could break down the what we know

1454
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:49,120
about science,
what we've done,

1455
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:54,121
what great work has been shown that we
can carbon date things we know about the

1456
01:04:55,061 --> 01:04:59,100
date of stars.
We can follow the radio waves in this,

1457
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,190
in that we can measure in space and
prove that there was a big bang 14

1458
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:06,090
billion years ago.
All that stuff is so exciting that if

1459
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,200
it's done correctly by a guy like Neil
Tyson,

1460
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,350
it can be unbelievably culturally,
culturally valuable,

1461
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:15,160
but those 46 percent of the people that
believed that the earth is 10,000 years

1462
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:18,010
old,
I can almost guarantee that they

1463
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,340
haven't had that in their life.
They just haven't been exposed to a

1464
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:25,570
charismatic scientist or a documentary
that was unbelievably compelling.

1465
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:29,050
That jived with their Christian ideology
so much they could absorb it.

1466
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:30,760
You know,
there had been brainwashed.

1467
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:32,740
They've been fucked over by their own
culture.

1468
01:05:32,741 --> 01:05:34,360
They've been fucked over by their
community.

1469
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:37,690
They've been fucked over by these
dummies that raised them and taught them

1470
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:42,691
this silly idea that so easily disproven
that it makes them a joke to anybody.

1471
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:45,430
That's had any sort of formal education
whatsoever,

1472
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:48,040
and it's almost half the population.

1473
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:52,880
Let let me point out something that it
kind of a surprising similarity between

1474
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,920
belief in creation as an belief in the
Kennedy,

1475
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,500
the Kennedy assassination,
there are,

1476
01:06:00,501 --> 01:06:03,800
like we talked about,
there are a dozen law.

1477
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,760
Well,
there's hundreds,

1478
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:08,750
but let's say that there's a dozen
different kennedy conspiracies that are

1479
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:10,730
mutually exclusive.
Just for sake of argument,

1480
01:06:10,731 --> 01:06:12,120
let's pretend it's a dozen.
Okay.

1481
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:15,950
You've got about just as many theories
of creation.

1482
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:18,860
Sure.
That are completely incompatible,

1483
01:06:18,890 --> 01:06:21,920
which is nothing existed until 6,000
years ago.

1484
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:26,210
Everything poof appeared with exactly
the appearance of age you've got.

1485
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:30,830
The earth is actually old,
but life is is a recent creation.

1486
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:34,760
You've got all the other animals are old
and evolution happened in everything

1487
01:06:34,761 --> 01:06:37,280
except humans,
which were a special creation event.

1488
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:41,930
You've got humans didn't evolve the way
science tells us,

1489
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:47,080
but then suddenly we were given souls on
the Adam and eve day or you've got all

1490
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:51,860
of these holidays now that we found a
columbus is an asshole.

1491
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,130
Now you can eat.
You can come up with science and and lot

1492
01:06:55,131 --> 01:06:57,200
of people have they've.
They've come up with quote unquote

1493
01:06:57,201 --> 01:06:59,660
science to support each one of these
different theories.

1494
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,100
Not really.
No,

1495
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:01,840
no,
no.

1496
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,130
What is in there?
What qualifies in their mind as

1497
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:05,370
scientific support for.
Okay,

1498
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:10,720
so exactly like the people who support
all these different versions of the

1499
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:14,990
Kennedy conspiracy,
even though all of their theories are

1500
01:07:14,991 --> 01:07:19,880
mutually in mutually exclusive,
completely incompatible.

1501
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,120
They all agree with.
They all consider themselves to be on

1502
01:07:23,121 --> 01:07:27,190
the same page in that they reject the
quote unquote official.

1503
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,040
I find that to be a disingenuous
argument because the argument for the

1504
01:07:31,041 --> 01:07:34,340
earth being billions of years old,
the universe being billions of years old

1505
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:39,341
is unbelievably unfathomably.
An overwhelming genius after genius has

1506
01:07:41,121 --> 01:07:46,121
broken down all the various particles of
the fucking universe and the dark matter

1507
01:07:46,221 --> 01:07:51,020
in the skies and the fact that inside
every black hole may ultimately be

1508
01:07:51,021 --> 01:07:54,020
another universe with hundreds of
billions of galaxies inside of it,

1509
01:07:54,021 --> 01:07:58,220
with black holes in each one of them
that the number of people that have

1510
01:07:58,221 --> 01:08:03,221
worked on provable conclusions about the
age of things using carbon dating or

1511
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:06,860
what does the other way,
radiocarbon dating and what's the new

1512
01:08:06,861 --> 01:08:07,540
one that they're doing?
Well,

1513
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:11,150
there's all sorts of,
but the sheer overwhelming numbers to

1514
01:08:11,151 --> 01:08:16,151
ignore that because you read some stupid
old book I think is way ridiculous than

1515
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:21,220
to look at a guy who was murdered and
know that someone shot him and that it

1516
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:24,590
might've been this guy that this other
gangster came and shot and killed,

1517
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:28,190
but we'll never know because he's dead.
But so many other pieces.

1518
01:08:28,191 --> 01:08:31,850
Vince Bugliosi could sit here and make
exactly the same argument in reverse,

1519
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:34,010
but he's chasing ghosts.
You're chasing ghosts.

1520
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:37,910
You can't go back to 1963.
You know how you gonna prove what

1521
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:38,773
happened

1522
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:42,660
back to 6,000 years ago.
And so you were were you there and you

1523
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,720
see dinosaurs running around a billion
years ago.

1524
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,700
That's not.
That's not compatible because you could

1525
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:48,680
take,
you could take a piece of wood and you

1526
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:50,990
can carbon date that piece of wood and
you find out what this word is,

1527
01:08:50,991 --> 01:08:52,910
5,000 years old.
You can do that.

1528
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:55,340
That's done.
That's a real thing when you're dealing

1529
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:57,080
with the Kennedy assassination is,
yeah,

1530
01:08:57,081 --> 01:09:00,170
you've got some stories and yeah,
you've got some facts and yeah,

1531
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:04,730
you've got some circumstances,
but putting it all together is a very

1532
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:08,240
complicated series of events that took
place in order to kill that guy and take

1533
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:12,320
his body and fly it to Bethesda,
Maryland and who gotten how to Jack

1534
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,210
Ruby.
Get in there and who benefited from all

1535
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:16,620
this.
There's a lot of variables and you are

1536
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:18,770
also exist,
but hold on,

1537
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:20,750
but variables that don't exist when
you're examining,

1538
01:09:21,020 --> 01:09:24,320
say like the core of the earth when
you're examining the birth and death of

1539
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:25,310
stars,
hyper,

1540
01:09:25,311 --> 01:09:27,260
Novas,
all these things that we can absolutely

1541
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:29,810
prove are a part of our natural world

1542
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,621
we live in.
Okay,

1543
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:32,700
but again,
you're talking down to you're,

1544
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:33,563
you're,
you're,

1545
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:37,400
you're,
you're ignoring the question of what

1546
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:41,750
constitutes evidence because there are
people who will make a compelling speech

1547
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:44,780
about why carbon dating is invalid.
Sure.

1548
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,790
Maybe the Lord has changed the route,
the,

1549
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,350
the,
the,

1550
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:48,790
the,
the,

1551
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,950
the speed at which a elements decay over
over the,

1552
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,620
over the centuries.
Now that's something you can't argue

1553
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:57,020
with because it's,
it's what we call a special pleading.

1554
01:09:57,021 --> 01:09:58,010
It's,
it's this,

1555
01:09:58,011 --> 01:10:00,320
as in humans,
we small humans are not able to

1556
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,830
understand this and that's an argument
that can be used to defend just about

1557
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,590
any pseudoscience or just about any
pseudo history.

1558
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:11,060
So I mean you can apply exactly the same
thing.

1559
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:16,610
Alternate versions of the Kennedy
history are always going to be just as

1560
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:21,440
valid as alternate versions of the age
of the earth and devolution and it's,

1561
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:23,860
it's,
they're made invalid in there.

1562
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:28,370
They are presented as being valid using
evidence that cannot be argued against

1563
01:10:28,371 --> 01:10:33,371
because it's theoretical sort of here.
Here's the problem with the government.

1564
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:37,040
The government has been proven time and
time again to be full of shit.

1565
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:40,820
So when you look at official government
stories and you say,

1566
01:10:40,821 --> 01:10:45,080
well let's take this as our conclusion
and now let's work backward from here

1567
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,060
and find out what,
what took place.

1568
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,280
Well,
we know that Lee Harvey Oswald acted

1569
01:10:49,281 --> 01:10:52,040
alone because the government says,
we know that Jack Ruby was a bad guy and

1570
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:55,130
he was very patriotic and he was really
sad and so that's why he did what he did

1571
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:56,660
and case closed.
Wrap it up,

1572
01:10:56,661 --> 01:10:58,880
tie boom.
When you

1573
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,540
and you look at all that,
it doesn't stand up to scrutiny.

1574
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,650
It does,
doesn't.

1575
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,030
It doesn't.
If you're dealing with a liar,

1576
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:06,400
a liar told you this crazy story.
Damn man.

1577
01:11:06,401 --> 01:11:07,840
I was on your way over to your house,
man.

1578
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:10,570
But a fucking asteroid came down and
knocked my tire off and I need another

1579
01:11:10,571 --> 01:11:12,940
tire side to wait in line and do what?
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1580
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:14,160
You're like,
that guy's a liar.

1581
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:16,140
He lies all the time.
He probably lied about this too.

1582
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,240
Well,
if you're dealing with something like

1583
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,360
the United States government that's
shown itself over and over and over

1584
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,490
again to be full of shit,
it'd be very convenient to tell the

1585
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:26,550
people what they want the people to
think rather than what is actually the

1586
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:29,520
truth,
and then he start citing instance after

1587
01:11:29,521 --> 01:11:32,040
instance.
It's not just a blind accusations,

1588
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:35,940
but instance after instance,
no longer do I think that it is not

1589
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:38,730
likely,
nor is it logical to assume that the,

1590
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,250
let's go official store,
which is a douchey term.

1591
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,130
It's a very loaded term.
The official story makes it question,

1592
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,170
but you to assume that the story that we
had been told in the mainstream media

1593
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,180
and the news is correct.
It doesn't make sense.

1594
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,760
Why would you assume it was correct,
but you're talking to a liar.

1595
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:57,840
But scientists have told us that carbon,
that carbon dating works,

1596
01:11:57,870 --> 01:11:58,550
you know,
uh,

1597
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,270
but we're talking about it's a matter of
faith in it.

1598
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:04,180
We have to have faith in the scientists
to accept carbon.

1599
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:05,351
Oh,
certainly not.

1600
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:07,510
You read the science on it.
You read how they come up with the

1601
01:12:07,511 --> 01:12:08,680
conclusions.
I'm an idiot,

1602
01:12:08,681 --> 01:12:11,830
but I read about carbon dating when I
was trying to figure out why they could

1603
01:12:11,831 --> 01:12:14,320
figure out that dinosaurs existed 65
million years ago.

1604
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:18,610
I'm unbelievably terrified and
fascinated by asteroidal impacts and

1605
01:12:18,611 --> 01:12:22,710
it's one of my main obsessions when it
comes to like late night freakouts

1606
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,870
watching the discovery channel and you
know,

1607
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,860
watching,
you know,

1608
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,400
the,
the,

1609
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:32,290
just the idea that one day we could get
hit by one of these 800 plus thousand

1610
01:12:32,291 --> 01:12:36,310
near Earth objects that are fucking
gigantic stones flying through the

1611
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:37,690
earth.
I'm fascinated by that shit.

1612
01:12:37,810 --> 01:12:42,280
So I got pretty deep into the whole idea
of carbon dating and the whole idea,

1613
01:12:42,281 --> 01:12:44,710
like how they figured it out and I've
read a bunch of articles on it and I

1614
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:48,010
watched documentaries on it.
It's pretty easy to figure out from an

1615
01:12:48,011 --> 01:12:49,960
idiot's point of view,
like how they're doing it.

1616
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:51,580
Like I don't understand the science
behind it.

1617
01:12:51,581 --> 01:12:54,850
I can't really replicate it,
but I listened to them describe it and

1618
01:12:54,851 --> 01:12:56,230
it clicks with me and it makes sense.

1619
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:57,760
Okay.
But I mean,

1620
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:00,880
so my argument is that

1621
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,890
disagreeing with carbon,
dating,

1622
01:13:05,891 --> 01:13:10,891
disagreeing with the scientific view of
the earth is very similar to disagreeing

1623
01:13:12,851 --> 01:13:15,130
with kind of the standard model of
history,

1624
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:17,920
standard monitor of the JFK
assassination.

1625
01:13:17,921 --> 01:13:21,910
As told I the US government.
I hate to use the term official story

1626
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,190
because I don't care.
I've never read called the ls.

1627
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:29,020
I've never read the Warren Commission
report.

1628
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:32,740
I've never read the nine slash 11
commission report to be honest.

1629
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,880
I don't know what's in them,
but I can tell you what happened to

1630
01:13:36,881 --> 01:13:39,880
Kennedy and I can tell you what happened
to what happened on nine slash 11

1631
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:43,060
according to what I would call our
standard model of history,

1632
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:47,800
which probably agrees and most respect
with the quote unquote official story.

1633
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:51,010
The issue with the standard model of the
history of those is disseminated by the

1634
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:53,920
US government.
People find easy to distrust.

1635
01:13:53,950 --> 01:13:54,783
No,
it's not.

1636
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,080
It's not.
No.

1637
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:59,830
When you were watching it on that
morning when you had your tv on,

1638
01:13:59,831 --> 01:14:01,720
you're watching the towers fall and
you're.

1639
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,610
You've got broadcasters with the
microphone.

1640
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,710
They were not being influenced by the
government.

1641
01:14:05,711 --> 01:14:08,350
They didn't have an earpiece in with
someone from the CIA telling them what

1642
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:10,900
to say next.
You were pretty much watching it happen

1643
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,430
through no government

1644
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:14,650
filter.
Oh right,

1645
01:14:14,651 --> 01:14:16,480
but wait a minute,
but when you're talking about the

1646
01:14:16,481 --> 01:14:20,080
official story of it,
it's not the news being told as the

1647
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:22,900
event goes down,
it's the explanation of why the event

1648
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:25,210
took place after the fact that people
disagree with.

1649
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,880
They don't.
No one disagrees that the towers fell

1650
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:28,810
with that.
Planes hit them.

1651
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,060
Sure they do.
There's people who think the planes were

1652
01:14:31,061 --> 01:14:32,380
holographs.
Okay.

1653
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,520
You getting really crazy though.
Hey,

1654
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:38,050
I mean there's.
There's all of these different theories

1655
01:14:38,051 --> 01:14:39,760
and while there's people that believe
the earth is hollow,

1656
01:14:39,761 --> 01:14:40,780
there's people that believe that life
is,

1657
01:14:40,781 --> 01:14:42,850
but a dream.
Merrily,

1658
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:43,631
merrily,
merrily,

1659
01:14:43,631 --> 01:14:45,450
merrily,
hollow,

1660
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,140
earth stories are awesome.
They're awesome.

1661
01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,220
They're all awesome.
I've,

1662
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,260
I've talked to those people.
They were fucking crazy.

1663
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:51,161
Well,
look,

1664
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:52,720
people are nuts.
You know there there's people that

1665
01:14:52,721 --> 01:14:54,310
walked down the street and talk to
people that aren't there.

1666
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:57,580
That doesn't mean that the government is
correct about Kennedy.

1667
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:00,100
Doesn't mean that Lee Harvey Oswald
acted alone.

1668
01:15:00,101 --> 01:15:05,101
It doesn't mean that there's no nothing
other than the reason to conclude that a

1669
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:10,210
single bullet in info inflicted all that
damage is nothing other than their need

1670
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:13,210
to tie up the fact that they'd committed
to the idea of three bullets,

1671
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:16,090
that that would be the only thing that
would be logical that this guy could get

1672
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:16,421
off.
They.

1673
01:15:16,421 --> 01:15:18,100
Nobody thought he could get off four
bullets.

1674
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,170
That was just like,
there's two crazy three.

1675
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,540
Maybe he could fucking boom,
boom,

1676
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,430
boom,
and get all three bullets in five

1677
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:27,660
seconds with a milk road car Canto
Chicago.

1678
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:31,420
When we were talking about that before I
was desperately on my ipad here.

1679
01:15:31,421 --> 01:15:34,240
I was trying to look up because at the
beginning of my episode I did a

1680
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:39,220
recreation of the time of the Pouch
Pouch.

1681
01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:43,240
And then it's a long hell,
a long pause until the final shot pouch

1682
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:45,880
shows it's something like nine seconds
or something.

1683
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,740
And that's a long time.
I believe that they're a little less

1684
01:15:47,741 --> 01:15:48,350
than that.
But,

1685
01:15:48,350 --> 01:15:50,020
um,
I thought it was five.

1686
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,720
But yeah,
that's the space between the last two

1687
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:56,320
shots that the number of seconds that
you're usually told is the space between

1688
01:15:56,321 --> 01:15:57,400
the last one.
Also,

1689
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:01,000
something against the conspiracy that I
would like to point out that people keep

1690
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:03,760
pointing out was that the scope and that
rifle was off.

1691
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:06,250
That was one of the things that people
kept saying that the scope and that

1692
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:07,360
rife,
it was a bad scope.

1693
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:12,910
As a someone who's fucked up their scope
before you could just put a rifle down

1694
01:16:12,911 --> 01:16:15,490
hard,
you drop it and it falls in the scope,

1695
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:18,940
bounce off the ground that scopes off.
So the chain of evidence between Lee

1696
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,270
Harvey on the idea that they found this
scope and it was impossible for them to

1697
01:16:22,271 --> 01:16:25,300
fight with his gun because the scope is
off is preposterous because anybody

1698
01:16:25,301 --> 01:16:28,570
could have dropped that gun after Oswald
left it there and fucked up that scope.

1699
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:31,930
So the fact that who knows how many days
or hours or whatever,

1700
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:35,620
later they went to check that scope to
see if it was cited in that stupid

1701
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,110
hunters have to cite their scopes and
after every trip,

1702
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:43,060
every time you put your stuff in luggage
packed in with all this like cushioning

1703
01:16:43,061 --> 01:16:46,030
and everything that makes sure in hard
cases you still have to recite your

1704
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:49,030
scope and you get to a range.
You have to because to be ethical,

1705
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:52,150
to make sure that you hit the animal
where you want to hit it because they go

1706
01:16:52,151 --> 01:16:53,500
off,
they bounce around,

1707
01:16:53,501 --> 01:16:55,640
they move.
Same issue with telescopes.

1708
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:00,310
The sites on those are very similar.
So I mean that doesn't mean though that

1709
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:03,190
you know,
the whole ball of wax,

1710
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,490
the whole government story is exactly
what happened.

1711
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:08,710
We're chasing ghosts.
Were talking about some shit from the

1712
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:12,740
sixties and trying to piece it together
and say case closed I think is

1713
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:13,550
preposterous.

1714
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:16,580
I think it's ridiculous.
I do think it's fascinating and I do

1715
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:20,390
think that people can lose their mind
and in and chasing it down and

1716
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:23,450
investigating it.
And I certainly did myself back in

1717
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,390
Pennsylvania when I was working at that
fucking club,

1718
01:17:26,660 --> 01:17:29,960
reading that stupid book all day and
then going on stage that night and just

1719
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,300
bombing.
I mean I had two shows that night in the

1720
01:17:32,301 --> 01:17:34,670
first show.
I just ate a plate of shit.

1721
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,190
And then the second show I pulled it
together and got back.

1722
01:17:37,191 --> 01:17:38,900
But I was depressed.
Why?

1723
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:39,560
I mean,
what were you?

1724
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,330
Were you were your child or getting your
material are always.

1725
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:42,981
Oh No,
no,

1726
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:43,970
no.
It's my mindset.

1727
01:17:43,971 --> 01:17:47,930
I've had to really distinctive times
where the things that I saw before I

1728
01:17:47,931 --> 01:17:50,960
went on stage fucked me up.
That was a big one.

1729
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:53,750
That was probably the first one.
Might have been the second one.

1730
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,250
It was all the same time.
It was a slow learner.

1731
01:17:55,640 --> 01:18:00,500
But the other one was I went with
this guy named jb smooth,

1732
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:03,470
you know jb smoove funny.
He's hilarious.

1733
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:08,030
And Jb and I were doing a college
together in New Jersey and jb was,

1734
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:10,530
it was really hard to find.
And Jb was,

1735
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:13,850
he was running late,
so they had me go on first and I wasn't

1736
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:18,380
prepared because I was sitting in the
little rec room with a TV on and the TV

1737
01:18:18,381 --> 01:18:20,810
was showing this documentary on the
Malibu fires.

1738
01:18:21,810 --> 01:18:24,560
Uh,
it was so fucking depressing.

1739
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:28,400
It was the early nineties and these
people lost everything and this guy was

1740
01:18:28,401 --> 01:18:31,400
crying.
He was a fireman and he was crying and

1741
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:32,810
weeping.
His house was still there,

1742
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:36,620
but it's neighbors had lost their houses
and he was just crying and weeping.

1743
01:18:36,621 --> 01:18:38,780
This girl was looking for her dog and
they're like,

1744
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:41,990
all right Joe,
I'm jb is still late.

1745
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:44,960
So what we're gonna do is we're going to
put you on and you do your sat and then

1746
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:46,670
he'll go on after you.
I was like,

1747
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,640
oh no.
So I went on stage thinking about this

1748
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,730
guy crying,
not even for his own loss but for his

1749
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:54,980
neighbors.
Last and that girl looking for a dog.

1750
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:59,981
And I just got so sad and I went on
stage at a shit that just title,

1751
01:19:00,790 --> 01:19:03,560
even Japan really messed me up for a few
days.

1752
01:19:03,710 --> 01:19:06,890
I was.
So I'd been to Japan just a few years

1753
01:19:06,890 --> 01:19:10,430
before and man just seeing,
seeing all that destruction and you just

1754
01:19:10,431 --> 01:19:11,440
know,
you know,

1755
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:13,430
watching those rivers,
Washington on the streets and

1756
01:19:13,431 --> 01:19:14,061
everything,
you know,

1757
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:16,050
it's full of people.
And it was a,

1758
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:18,200
I was messed up for days.
Yeah,

1759
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:21,620
it's horrible.
So those comedy required.

1760
01:19:21,621 --> 01:19:22,011
I mean,
you know,

1761
01:19:22,011 --> 01:19:25,940
people are paying to see you take them
out of this reality and have them escape

1762
01:19:25,941 --> 01:19:26,990
into some fun world.

1763
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:29,620
I wasn't good at it,
you know,

1764
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,460
it was only.
I was only 20,

1765
01:19:31,461 --> 01:19:34,580
maybe 23 or something at the time I just
was clumsy.

1766
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:38,240
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing
and the idea of reading this conspiracy

1767
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:41,770
book all day and freaking out.
I also was bad at perspective.

1768
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,120
Putting things in portfolio.
Listen,

1769
01:19:43,121 --> 01:19:44,600
this,
this took place in [inaudible] 63.

1770
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:46,640
Here we are and you know,
1990.

1771
01:19:46,641 --> 01:19:48,050
Why am I thinking about this?
You know,

1772
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,200
I didn't have that ability to switch
gears.

1773
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:53,210
So interesting.
Well I stand up.

1774
01:19:53,211 --> 01:19:55,820
Comedy is,
is one of the careers that I have the

1775
01:19:55,821 --> 01:20:00,821
most respect for because you can't not
be smart and get away with it.

1776
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:03,280
You've obviously never seen Brian
onstage.

1777
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:07,300
He kills and he's not smart.
You've got it.

1778
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:07,980
You've got to

1779
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:10,620
be a great speaker.
You've got to be good on your feet.

1780
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,120
I mean,
I,

1781
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,440
I'm just impressed.
It's not a good speaker.

1782
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:14,710
I barely can talk,
talk.

1783
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:16,120
So he's got worms in his mouth.
Okay.

1784
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,910
My,
my theory is disproven.

1785
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:18,391
Well,
he,

1786
01:20:18,391 --> 01:20:19,710
um,
he also has a cheat code.

1787
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:23,610
He's got the,
the God code became famous and then he

1788
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:27,600
started doing comedy again.
It's your prop comedy without a proper

1789
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:33,000
profit is his personality.
Well,

1790
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:33,630
thank you.
I mean,

1791
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,540
that's very nice of you to say.
Um,

1792
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:36,374
it's a.

1793
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:40,040
my friend Joey Diaz says it best.
He says it's the hardest,

1794
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:42,680
easiest thing you'll ever do.
When you're good at it and you get good

1795
01:20:42,681 --> 01:20:44,930
at it and you stay at it and you develop
momentum,

1796
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:47,150
then it's easy.
But to get to that point,

1797
01:20:47,151 --> 01:20:48,780
it's very hard.
And that,

1798
01:20:48,860 --> 01:20:52,400
that was my,
my birth or my.

1799
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:56,720
I'm entering into the world of
conspiracies and the fascination with

1800
01:20:56,721 --> 01:20:59,180
them came from that,
from that one book,

1801
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,940
100 percent,
no doubt about it.

1802
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:05,530
That I can trace it back to that one
book that made me start questioning

1803
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:08,630
reality of what I'd been taught.
Are there other roads you've gone down

1804
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:09,320
that,
uh,

1805
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,200
that you've since turned away from the
Moon landings?

1806
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:14,240
Most drastic,
like again,

1807
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,440
I say for,
you know,

1808
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:20,500
just as a caveat,
I always wish the moon landing was fake

1809
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:23,930
and I would be much more happy if it
turned out it was a giant hoax then if

1810
01:21:23,931 --> 01:21:25,610
people went to the moon,
why?

1811
01:21:25,940 --> 01:21:29,270
Because I'm a silly bitch and because I
like silly things and I love,

1812
01:21:29,271 --> 01:21:32,420
I think it'd be a greater accomplishment
for people to fake that we went to the

1813
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,340
moon.
They would almost even be to go to the

1814
01:21:34,341 --> 01:21:36,230
moon.
I mean,

1815
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,490
that was what Neil said.
Yeah.

1816
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:39,370
Yeah.
Well that's also with the,

1817
01:21:39,371 --> 01:21:40,360
you know,
I mean,

1818
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:43,310
a lot of people that have argued against
it have said,

1819
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:45,550
yeah,
science even scientifically that it

1820
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,400
would be more impressive.

1821
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,370
It would.
And I think,

1822
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:48,860
uh,
the,

1823
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:49,990
the,
the point that,

1824
01:21:49,991 --> 01:21:51,850
uh,
the number of people who would be

1825
01:21:51,851 --> 01:21:54,800
expected to keep a secret as well.
Okay.

1826
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:56,080
This is something that,
um,

1827
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:59,380
we have a road.
We went down with the flight was flight

1828
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:03,580
93 or flight 77 flight 93 was the one
that got shot down over Pennsylvania 93.

1829
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:08,440
So I've got a friend who does not
believe in any of the nine slash 11

1830
01:22:08,441 --> 01:22:11,620
conspiracies,
except he believes that we did

1831
01:22:11,621 --> 01:22:13,300
successfully shoot down that plane.

1832
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,760
Well,
I will tell you this without saying

1833
01:22:16,761 --> 01:22:21,260
anyone's name or speaking any further
that I know people that are in the

1834
01:22:21,261 --> 01:22:26,060
military and I asked them,
is it possible that in a situation where

1835
01:22:26,061 --> 01:22:28,940
a plane was going to be flown into the
Pentagon,

1836
01:22:28,941 --> 01:22:31,460
that they would have fighter jets it out
of Scott?

1837
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,640
Do you think that would be possible?
And they said 100 percent.

1838
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:36,080
Yeah.
One hundred percent possible.

1839
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,890
Oh,
we would do it.

1840
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,140
We had to.
We had plans on the way to do it.

1841
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,940
Yeah.
They didn't get there in time.

1842
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:43,700
Allegedly.
I,

1843
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:44,331
I,
I,

1844
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:46,410
I have,
I have no problem with the fact that

1845
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:48,240
they were on the way to get it,
but,

1846
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:51,270
but the thing is that that's another
case where you got to look at the number

1847
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:53,760
of people involved because if a missile
gets shot,

1848
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:58,380
a missile getting shot is a big deal
because you've got all kinds of

1849
01:22:58,381 --> 01:23:00,310
accounting that has to happen for that.
Not,

1850
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,670
not only do you have the ground crew and
everyone's supposed to spend this long

1851
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:05,350
just shakes it off.
You've got civilian oversight for all

1852
01:23:05,351 --> 01:23:07,570
the supplies that happen.
Again,

1853
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:10,000
for a plane to shoot a missile that
nobody knows about,

1854
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,070
that's again going to involve,
you know,

1855
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,950
a pyramid of people,
you know,

1856
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:17,530
100 people at the base may be at a
minimum,

1857
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:21,580
a thousand people in the civilian
oversight contractors.

1858
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:25,560
It just goes on and on and on.
The number of people that would have

1859
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,870
wished that I could agree with that I,

1860
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:31,690
but I can't because of the fact that
they have black funded projects because

1861
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:36,160
of the fact that they develop things in
total complete secrecy in area 51 that

1862
01:23:36,161 --> 01:23:37,930
involve billions and billions of
dollars.

1863
01:23:37,931 --> 01:23:42,010
That's where the technology came from.
That's where you know many different

1864
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:45,280
advanced technologies have come from
without any knowledge whatsoever by the

1865
01:23:45,281 --> 01:23:48,460
American people.
So to say that it would be hard to hide

1866
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:51,010
a missile,
it would certainly be an issue.

1867
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,920
We'd certainly be an issue,
but I don't think that a government that

1868
01:23:53,921 --> 01:23:56,740
could make a fucking stealth bomber
would have a hard time hiding a missile.

1869
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:58,850
Well okay.
But these planes did not come from area

1870
01:23:58,851 --> 01:24:01,880
51.
They can totally open basis trail walk

1871
01:24:01,881 --> 01:24:02,990
on and off of it day.

1872
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:04,110
That's true.
But if you can.

1873
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,720
Well people walk on and off of the area,
51 everyday too.

1874
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:10,080
They just come in by buses.
They just come in on planes and buses

1875
01:24:10,081 --> 01:24:11,250
from,
from Vegas.

1876
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:14,450
But that doesn't necessarily mean that
that's,

1877
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:16,290
that's what happened.
But it does.

1878
01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:19,560
The idea of saying this could never
happen because you would have too many

1879
01:24:19,561 --> 01:24:23,340
people not really think about all the
shit that they have designed that no one

1880
01:24:23,341 --> 01:24:27,150
knew they had until they had this.
There's a lot of secrecy still in

1881
01:24:27,151 --> 01:24:29,310
government when they do it right and
they're really good at it.

1882
01:24:29,430 --> 01:24:31,790
When it comes to national security,
they can keep things take,

1883
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:33,460
but.
But also those things weren't all that

1884
01:24:33,461 --> 01:24:34,960
remarkable.
There was nothing.

1885
01:24:35,230 --> 01:24:38,470
Nothing that ever happened at area 51
turned out to really be all that

1886
01:24:38,471 --> 01:24:39,460
interesting.
Blackbird.

1887
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:40,300
Yeah.

1888
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:43,690
You don't think that that's remarkable.
These unbelievable jets.

1889
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:45,730
You don't think that stealth technology
is remarkable.

1890
01:24:45,731 --> 01:24:48,910
The fact that they look like Ufo and
they can hide from radar.

1891
01:24:49,310 --> 01:24:50,360
God Damn.
You're hard.

1892
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,060
No,
I go to google.

1893
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:56,520
Com.
Google came from really area 51.

1894
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:57,750
Oh,
you're joking.

1895
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:58,380
No,
I mean there's.

1896
01:24:58,380 --> 01:24:59,850
There's being.
Well,

1897
01:24:59,851 --> 01:25:03,030
I'm buying it and anyone can get
started.

1898
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:06,660
I'm a big aerospace nut and I follow a
lot of the aerospace reporting and

1899
01:25:06,661 --> 01:25:10,110
anyone,
anyone in that industry knows what goes

1900
01:25:10,111 --> 01:25:13,130
on at area 51 because it's basically
the.

1901
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:15,660
It's the national test facility is what
it's actually called.

1902
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:17,610
They simply,
that's where they're testing the next

1903
01:25:17,611 --> 01:25:21,210
generation planes.
I wouldn't be surprised to see what

1904
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:22,230
they're testing.
They're now,

1905
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,540
uh,
because we pretty much have a pretty

1906
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,480
good idea of what it looks like.
And that's the,

1907
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,790
that was the case in the 19 sixties was
the case in the 19 seventies.

1908
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:34,040
You've obviously never seen the
interviews with Robert Lasar know our

1909
01:25:34,050 --> 01:25:35,970
favorite guy.
Oh my God.

1910
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:36,960
Yeah.
You have.

1911
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:38,120
Oh,
I know all about Bob.

1912
01:25:38,130 --> 01:25:38,600
Hello?
Sorry.

1913
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:39,170
Yeah,
I,

1914
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:40,700
I,
I did a whole episode on,

1915
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:43,940
on his thing as well.
He's a fascinating cat because he seems

1916
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:44,850
so smart.
And then you finally,

1917
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:46,610
he lied about his college education
know.

1918
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,840
Oh,
I think you might be crazy.

1919
01:25:49,370 --> 01:25:49,910
Yeah.
That,

1920
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:50,721
that,
that was a,

1921
01:25:50,721 --> 01:25:53,840
that was really quite a wonder.
But anyone who is in the note was

1922
01:25:53,841 --> 01:25:55,250
laughing at him from the beginning.
Oh,

1923
01:25:55,251 --> 01:25:57,650
really?
Only fooled people in the Ufo community.

1924
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,580
Well,
that sounds like an ad hominem attack,

1925
01:25:59,581 --> 01:26:02,120
sir.
And that doesn't do very much to support

1926
01:26:02,121 --> 01:26:04,280
your arguments.
So

1927
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,990
was terrible debating skill you have
here,

1928
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:09,320
Brian Dunning.
He was wrong because of who he is to the

1929
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:10,550
end.
Um,

1930
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:14,270
nobody wants us to be real more than me,
like nobody wants to dig for it to be

1931
01:26:14,271 --> 01:26:16,190
real more than me.
Now I'm silly.

1932
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:17,810
I'm a silly person.
I'm a comedian,

1933
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,030
you know,
I don't have any vested interest in

1934
01:26:20,031 --> 01:26:24,320
keeping the status quo and standard
operational procedure in place.

1935
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:27,920
I like it all falling apart.
I would love it if a Ufo flood flow over

1936
01:26:27,921 --> 01:26:31,220
the city and people started shitting
their pants and throwing bed pans out

1937
01:26:31,221 --> 01:26:32,360
the windows.
I would love it.

1938
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,850
I told you what,
when I first got here to the studio,

1939
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:39,851
I told you that bigfoot is something
that I believed in until five years ago.

1940
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:42,170
Fairly recent.
Well,

1941
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,690
not just that.
You said you believe the Patterson

1942
01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:46,250
Gimlin footage.
Oh yeah.

1943
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:46,910
No,
I,

1944
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,880
I always believed that the Patterson
Gimlin footage,

1945
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:53,050
um,
do I just call it pattern and Kim

1946
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:53,953
leadership.

1947
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:58,390
I always believed that that looked
incredibly good and I still do now.

1948
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,430
The people who say that's the worst fake
I've ever seen.

1949
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,810
I think they're being disingenuous
because I think it's a brilliant face.

1950
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:08,810
I think it looks great.
You're hilarious.

1951
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:10,790
I know the whole history of the film and
everything.

1952
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:13,720
Um,
and Bob.

1953
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:14,990
Yeah.
The whole thing with,

1954
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:16,370
you know,
when was the film where,

1955
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:18,350
when was the film purchase?
Was it developed?

1956
01:27:18,351 --> 01:27:21,920
How did it get from A to b?
And we know that pretty much everything

1957
01:27:21,921 --> 01:27:26,240
he said about it was a lie and we pretty
much have a good picture of the film's

1958
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:29,930
history and we know that it was faked.
We also know that he was arrested for

1959
01:27:29,931 --> 01:27:32,090
larceny,
for writing a bad check.

1960
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:36,980
He was very camera that he used to film
and he had been paid.

1961
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:40,250
He was on a hunt to make a big foot
documentary for God's sake.

1962
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:43,590
Don't bring this up to bobcat.
Goldthwait crazy.

1963
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:46,700
Crazy.
We had on my show.

1964
01:27:46,701 --> 01:27:48,040
I had um,
uh,

1965
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:48,650
well,
here's,

1966
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:50,570
here's the video.
Let's watch the video real quick just so

1967
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:53,330
we can show how silly you are that you
think that this looks real.

1968
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,820
The stabilized version,
because this one's horrible because this

1969
01:27:58,821 --> 01:28:02,780
is how it was first released.
It was first released in this sort of

1970
01:28:02,781 --> 01:28:03,890
like weird,
shaky,

1971
01:28:03,891 --> 01:28:05,550
shaky version.
Um,

1972
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:08,210
this is actually probably stabilized
because it,

1973
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:10,810
I mean,
I think that looks so stupid and fake.

1974
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:14,870
How can you say it looks fake because
it's so bad quality.

1975
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,540
Exactly.
If there was anything in there that gave

1976
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:18,650
it away,
like a Zipper,

1977
01:28:18,651 --> 01:28:21,500
it wouldn't be visible because of the
low graininess the way he walks.

1978
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:23,210
He walks like a person.
I mean,

1979
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:24,980
it doesn't mean that it's not a big
giant person,

1980
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:28,730
but he walks like a person and I don't
think when you watch an elephant walk,

1981
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:30,740
there's,
there's a reality to the weight that

1982
01:28:30,741 --> 01:28:34,400
they carry around and that thing is not
walking with the reality of the weight

1983
01:28:34,401 --> 01:28:36,980
of an 800 pound,
1000 pound animal.

1984
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:38,930
That thing is walking.
Maybe he's,

1985
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:40,760
maybe he's five,
six.

1986
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:44,270
Well,
they decided they were going to measure

1987
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:47,400
off all the different trees in that area
and figure out how tall he was.

1988
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,690
I didn't say I thought it looked like he
was over six feet tall.

1989
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:52,220
I said it looked like a real animal to
me.

1990
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:53,061
Well,
it doesn't.

1991
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:54,710
To me it looks like a guy in a monkey
suit.

1992
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:58,300
It looks stupid.
I'm what I'm doing is I'm,

1993
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,770
I,
I'm admitting where I have had,

1994
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,190
where susceptible

1995
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:03,330
to,
you know,

1996
01:29:03,331 --> 01:29:04,710
I wanted big foot to be real.

1997
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:05,860
I understand.
And in,

1998
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:08,680
in finding yourself that you were indeed
a silly bitch.

1999
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:11,710
Now what you're doing is you're bouncing
the other way and going was,

2000
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,060
I'm sorry,
excuse me at the time,

2001
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:15,700
and now you're,
you're bouncing completely the other way

2002
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:19,360
and hardcore skeptic,
a skeptic by,

2003
01:29:19,450 --> 01:29:20,950
by,
not by choice,

2004
01:29:20,951 --> 01:29:22,900
but by default,
instantly,

2005
01:29:22,901 --> 01:29:26,020
automatically lean towards the skeptic.
Shouldn't we all be?

2006
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:28,450
I think we should be very objective for
sure,

2007
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:30,550
and I think it can be very confusing if
you're not,

2008
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:32,740
you know,
if you do go looking around for

2009
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:33,880
conspiracies,
the,

2010
01:29:33,881 --> 01:29:37,540
the better alternative is most certainly
to be skeptical by default,

2011
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:40,330
but I also think that you,
you miss a lot of shit.

2012
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:41,433
Like,
okay,

2013
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:43,270
here's a perfect example and I use this
one all the time.

2014
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:45,100
Unfortunately for people listening to
podcasts.

2015
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:47,620
Do you believe that nine slash 11
happened?

2016
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:50,470
Do you believe that planes flew into
buildings?

2017
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:51,700
Do you believe that happens?
Yes.

2018
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Then you believe in conspiracies?
Yes.

2019
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:55,871
Yes,
yes.

2020
01:29:55,871 --> 01:29:57,730
They conspired to do that and they
pulled it off.

2021
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,720
A bunch of people hijack planes
simultaneously in different spots in the

2022
01:30:01,721 --> 01:30:03,820
country.
They got control of the planes,

2023
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,580
flew those planes into buildings.
Causal buildings collapse.

2024
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:08,470
Thousands people died.
It was a conspiracy.

2025
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:12,520
It was a successfully executed
conspiracy and only one of many that we

2026
01:30:12,521 --> 01:30:16,450
know of all throughout history.
So if you automatically take the skeptic

2027
01:30:16,451 --> 01:30:19,690
point of view,
you miss out on the possibility of

2028
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:23,710
exposing something that is a true
conspiracy because they do exist.

2029
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,300
Well,
when you say the skeptic point of view,

2030
01:30:25,301 --> 01:30:28,120
what do you mean how I would say the
null hypothesis,

2031
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,510
the null hypothesis is that Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone.

2032
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,460
The null hypothesis is that probably
nothing remarkable happened.

2033
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:38,890
Well,
why would you say that?

2034
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:39,851
Well,
okay.

2035
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,410
Remarkable things happen all the time
though.

2036
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,030
Why would.
Why would that be a fault?

2037
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:43,890
Okay,
you're what?

2038
01:30:43,890 --> 01:30:44,290
What?
What?

2039
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:48,760
What I mean in that case is take the.
Take the guy for a different example of

2040
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:50,440
a shooting.
Take the guy who shot all the people at

2041
01:30:50,441 --> 01:30:53,800
the movie theater.
The null hypothesis is that a guy shot

2042
01:30:53,801 --> 01:30:57,940
all the movie people in the movie
theater as was reported by everyone who

2043
01:30:57,941 --> 01:30:58,790
was there,
right?

2044
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:03,580
The null hypothesis and the Kennedy
situation would be that Lee Harvey

2045
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:08,200
Oswald acted alone as discovered by the
cops who chased him down and tackled him

2046
01:31:08,201 --> 01:31:12,820
and arrested him in the movie theater.
The null hypothesis for nine slash 11

2047
01:31:12,821 --> 01:31:17,350
would be that what happened generally as
well as we saw it on television and was

2048
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:19,360
reported by the people where there is
what happened.

2049
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:23,200
That's that would be the null hypothesis
and anything remarkable would be

2050
01:31:23,201 --> 01:31:26,980
something that goes against what appears
to have happened on that day.

2051
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:32,830
So I would say that the null hypothesis
is going to generally be right most of

2052
01:31:32,831 --> 01:31:36,220
the time until we've got some remarkable
evidence to prove it wrong.

2053
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:36,680
How do

2054
01:31:36,680 --> 01:31:41,450
you factor in contradictory evidence
from reputable online news sources?

2055
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,400
Like,
like for example,

2056
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:44,410
like let's,
uh,

2057
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:48,350
the NSA.
It's perfect example before it was

2058
01:31:48,351 --> 01:31:52,130
revealed by Edward Snowden that the NSA
was indeed spying on all these different

2059
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:55,580
Americans and detailing records of your
phone calls.

2060
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:58,370
And who was surprised by that?
Very few people were,

2061
01:31:58,371 --> 01:32:00,220
but the people were had argued

2062
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,760
against it via millie and they had said,
there's no way there would be such a

2063
01:32:03,761 --> 01:32:06,580
huge conspiracy.
You'd have to hide that from so many

2064
01:32:06,581 --> 01:32:08,830
people.
So many people would be in the know.

2065
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:10,600
There's no way that that could be
possibly true.

2066
01:32:10,601 --> 01:32:11,800
I heard that.
I.

2067
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:16,960
I witnessed Alex Jones having that
discussion with a person where Alex

2068
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,990
Jones,
who predicted this shit a long time ago,

2069
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:22,510
almost a decade before it actually
happened,

2070
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:26,320
I believe it was 2003 or four.
Alex Jones was saying,

2071
01:32:26,321 --> 01:32:29,710
if you don't think they're keeping
detailed records of every phone call,

2072
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,710
you make everything you do,
every email you send.

2073
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,970
He was on it way before and I thought it
was crazy nutty conspiracy talk.

2074
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:38,163
Meanwhile,
he was right.

2075
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:39,490
They really were.
They really,

2076
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:42,790
really figured out how to do it.
They developed this technology.

2077
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:45,520
They created this storage facility that
they're in the middle of the building

2078
01:32:45,521 --> 01:32:46,840
right now in Utah.

2079
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,960
That's going to be this massive
warehouse of data and information.

2080
01:32:49,961 --> 01:32:51,970
That's a real conspiracy.
That turned out to be true.

2081
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:54,160
I don't think that there was.
Well,

2082
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:55,610
I can't say that Alex,
you,

2083
01:32:55,611 --> 01:32:57,430
I don't give him credit for predicting.
How dare you.

2084
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:01,540
There's nothing.
There's nothing that snowden revealed

2085
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:04,960
that I don't think was pretty much
generally suspected.

2086
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:07,180
Anyway.
We know that cell phone companies have

2087
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:10,180
always had all your cell phone records.
Therefore the government has them.

2088
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:12,000
That's not surprising to me.
Well,

2089
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:14,530
they could access that.
Surprising that someone would be

2090
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:16,330
surprised by that.
Really.

2091
01:33:16,331 --> 01:33:20,320
That's funny because I thought it was a
pretty big revelation cause for alarm.

2092
01:33:20,321 --> 01:33:22,060
A lot of people were up in arms about
it.

2093
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:24,800
It was a pretty big deal.
I don't think they have.

2094
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,830
I think people have always been up in
arms about it.

2095
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,930
There's been a lot of people saying,
Hey,

2096
01:33:28,931 --> 01:33:32,290
the self privacy,
the cell phone company shouldn't have

2097
01:33:32,291 --> 01:33:34,380
any way to track my calls or or to do.

2098
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:38,170
But they can and they own their cell
phone company so they can do whatever

2099
01:33:38,171 --> 01:33:40,870
the heck they want and as long as those
records exist,

2100
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:43,420
it's pretty naive to believe that nobody
has access to them.

2101
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:44,293
Well,
sure.

2102
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:46,870
That is not the issue.
The issue is that they're doing it for

2103
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:50,560
every single American all the time.
They constantly following you and

2104
01:33:50,561 --> 01:33:54,040
constantly watching your emails and
constantly that it's not a matter of

2105
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:56,620
looking at suspicious,
suspicious people or people that have

2106
01:33:56,621 --> 01:33:58,780
been accused of crimes.
It's a matter of people that are just

2107
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:01,450
law abiding citizens that are taxpayers
and doing nothing wrong,

2108
01:34:01,451 --> 01:34:05,980
but yet they're being almost like held
because they're checking all their

2109
01:34:05,981 --> 01:34:08,320
information.
It's like this thing that they hold over

2110
01:34:08,321 --> 01:34:11,800
your head and the idea that this could
be used to intimidate political

2111
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:15,580
opponents so this could be used to
intimidate business rivals.

2112
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:18,070
You know,
that that was a huge conspiracy and I

2113
01:34:18,071 --> 01:34:20,650
think to,
to deny that that was pretty shocking to

2114
01:34:20,651 --> 01:34:24,490
the American people when we found out
that they not only did indeed have this

2115
01:34:24,491 --> 01:34:27,610
power and capability,
but they had been utilizing it for a

2116
01:34:27,611 --> 01:34:30,790
long time.
Some things only shocking if you didn't

2117
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:34,390
have enough information to be aware of
that that was going on.

2118
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:36,430
Um,
and I,

2119
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:40,960
I mean I come from the Silicon Valley
background and

2120
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,740
with the formation of all the big,
the big search engines and things like

2121
01:34:47,741 --> 01:34:51,250
that,
having worked at enormous ridiculously

2122
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:54,970
huge data centers and everything and
having a general idea of how the

2123
01:34:54,971 --> 01:34:56,800
technology works.
I mean it's,

2124
01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:00,530
it's,
it's to me it's nothing,

2125
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:02,540
nothing in that is surprising that,
that,

2126
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:06,320
that data is being collected on that
large of a scale or that anyone would

2127
01:35:06,321 --> 01:35:08,600
have access to it.
Nothing.

2128
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:12,350
Nothing I've heard coming from snowden
surprised me in any way and wouldn't

2129
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:15,080
surprise most of the people from a
similar background as me I think.

2130
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:17,540
I think for a lot of people is quite
shocking.

2131
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:19,250
I'm sure it was.
But,

2132
01:35:19,251 --> 01:35:21,170
um,
but I think if you,

2133
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:23,700
if you know anything about the way the
technology works and about that,

2134
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:26,270
the whole data storage and collection
industry,

2135
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,750
you know,
the null hypothesis has got to be that

2136
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:32,300
hey,
anyone who wants access to it has access

2137
01:35:32,301 --> 01:35:37,301
to but in wasn't the no hypothesis when
Obama gave that speech and said that

2138
01:35:37,671 --> 01:35:39,740
we're not doing it and this is just
metadata.

2139
01:35:39,741 --> 01:35:43,220
And when didn't believe people believe
that it wasn't that essentially what

2140
01:35:43,221 --> 01:35:45,320
everyone was reporting in the news and
everyone was saying,

2141
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:47,450
listen,
this is much ado about nothing.

2142
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:48,740
This is just metadata.
Don't worry.

2143
01:35:48,741 --> 01:35:50,660
And then it turned out that that wasn't
the case at all.

2144
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:53,180
Well,
the null hypothesis also,

2145
01:35:53,210 --> 01:35:57,350
I think that the government,
the government maybe,

2146
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:58,130
maybe,
uh,

2147
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:03,100
maybe a presidential press releases are
not always exactly accurate to a federal

2148
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:03,830
truth.

2149
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:06,260
How do we apply that to everything else?
How do we apply that to the Kennedy

2150
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:08,930
assassination?
And how mean the nutters hear this and

2151
01:36:08,931 --> 01:36:10,340
they're going to apply it.
Sorry for calling.

2152
01:36:10,341 --> 01:36:12,280
You notice folks,
but the nine slash 11 truther,

2153
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:14,510
how about that?
There they apply that to nine slash 11.

2154
01:36:14,511 --> 01:36:17,030
Truth there say this is you're
contradicting yourself.

2155
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,200
The whole idea that what they're saying
is,

2156
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:27,320
is not the null hypothesis or what do
you mean will you said that the

2157
01:36:27,321 --> 01:36:30,170
government tends to be a liar when it
comes to press conferences.

2158
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:30,741
Oh,
okay.

2159
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:31,574
Okay.
I got you.

2160
01:36:31,610 --> 01:36:36,500
And an official story.
The official story is is a lie because

2161
01:36:36,501 --> 01:36:39,920
it's the official story because it's
coming from the government compared to

2162
01:36:39,980 --> 01:36:43,550
the null hypothesis being that the
government always lies about everything

2163
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:46,640
or a frequently is not completely
truthful.

2164
01:36:46,790 --> 01:36:47,061
Well,
no,

2165
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:51,230
it wasn't a no hypothesis that the story
that's being produced in the media is

2166
01:36:51,231 --> 01:36:53,420
the actual story that whatever the,
the,

2167
01:36:53,421 --> 01:36:58,010
the conclusions that mainstream is
accepted about Osama bin Ladin and these

2168
01:36:58,011 --> 01:37:01,640
hijackers from Saudi Arabia and all
these different things that factor into

2169
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:05,930
the events of nine slash 11 are in fact
exactly how it went down when you in

2170
01:37:05,931 --> 01:37:09,380
fact just said that when it comes to
like the NSA and the Obama

2171
01:37:09,381 --> 01:37:13,670
administration not being correct or
being truthful about metadata and what

2172
01:37:13,671 --> 01:37:16,550
was being collected that well,
the United States government tends to

2173
01:37:16,551 --> 01:37:17,030
lie well.

2174
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:19,520
If they tend to lie,
they tend to lie and if they tend to

2175
01:37:19,521 --> 01:37:20,990
lie,
why would you assume that there are

2176
01:37:20,991 --> 01:37:24,170
other explanations for all the different
things that have taken place for true at

2177
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,670
all?
It wouldn't be the happy.

2178
01:37:25,690 --> 01:37:29,150
It's just fascinating subject and
obviously very complicated,

2179
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:32,240
but that's my point.
That's the point.

2180
01:37:32,241 --> 01:37:32,780
Yes,
but,

2181
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:35,900
but also when you say the official
story,

2182
01:37:35,901 --> 01:37:38,060
when you're talking about what the
government says,

2183
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:43,640
that's not necessarily the source of
information that people are relying on.

2184
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:46,580
Nobody has read the nine slash 11
report.

2185
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,680
Nobody has read the Warren Commission
report.

2186
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:50,750
You and I,
we don't even know what the government's

2187
01:37:50,751 --> 01:37:52,760
position is on those.
We assume we do.

2188
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:54,980
We assume that it's whatever's in those
reports,

2189
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:56,130
what people generally

2190
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:58,140
believe about it,
but that's not our source of

2191
01:37:58,141 --> 01:38:00,090
information.
We didn't go to the government for our

2192
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:01,770
information.
I've.

2193
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:06,840
I don't think I've ever had a question
about nine slash 11 that I've gone and

2194
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:09,300
googled a government website to find out
what the,

2195
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:11,370
what,
what should have happened,

2196
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:12,060
what I'm supposed to be

2197
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:12,930
belief is.
I don't think anything.

2198
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:14,760
There are government websites and spell
out history.

2199
01:38:15,380 --> 01:38:17,160
Is there a government website?
It's history.

2200
01:38:17,161 --> 01:38:18,660
I don't think that exists.
I have no.

2201
01:38:18,661 --> 01:38:19,950
It fucking crushed that thing.

2202
01:38:20,270 --> 01:38:23,900
The thing is you,
you can't conflate the government's

2203
01:38:23,930 --> 01:38:26,930
version of events with.
That's why I like to use the term,

2204
01:38:26,940 --> 01:38:29,120
the standard model.
The standard model is what,

2205
01:38:29,510 --> 01:38:31,730
you know,
probably most historians,

2206
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,080
p,
whatever,

2207
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:35,330
whatever the field is,
whatever the scientists are,

2208
01:38:35,331 --> 01:38:37,700
whatever the historians are,
if it's a historical weather,

2209
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,200
what,
what most lawyers think,

2210
01:38:39,201 --> 01:38:40,330
if it's a legal question,
I don't,

2211
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:43,340
I would call it the standard model.
I would not use the term of the official

2212
01:38:43,341 --> 01:38:45,920
story because that suggests government
involvement,

2213
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:49,670
which is not not an authoritative
source.

2214
01:38:50,210 --> 01:38:51,410
The government,
quote unquote,

2215
01:38:51,411 --> 01:38:53,840
is not an authoritative source on
anything.

2216
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:56,630
It's not where people get their nine
slash 11 information.

2217
01:38:56,631 --> 01:38:59,540
We get that from basically from
historians,

2218
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:00,400
you know,
for,

2219
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:04,490
from modern history.
It's not the official source on how many

2220
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:06,500
neutrons are in a boron,
Adam,

2221
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:07,510
you know,
that's,

2222
01:39:07,530 --> 01:39:09,590
we get that from the standard model of
science.

2223
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:11,440
So,
um,

2224
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:14,420
I,
I don't think it's too much of a,

2225
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:19,370
I don't think it's hypocritical for me
to say that I'm a boy.

2226
01:39:19,371 --> 01:39:22,760
I'm twisting myself into knots here.
I don't think it's hypocritical for me

2227
01:39:22,761 --> 01:39:26,690
to say that when Obama says something
that we shouldn't accept as the truth,

2228
01:39:27,530 --> 01:39:29,060
um,
that,

2229
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:34,061
that conflicts with the government's
official position on nine slash 11 or

2230
01:39:34,341 --> 01:39:36,500
snowden or what the end of the Kennedy
assassination.

2231
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:39,260
I think what I'm saying makes sense.

2232
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:39,750
Well,
the,

2233
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:42,170
the issue with that is,
of course the news outlets,

2234
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:45,080
especially in the Kennedy assassination,
got all their information from the

2235
01:39:45,081 --> 01:39:47,810
government.
They got all the reports from

2236
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:53,140
spokespersons that were assigned this
position to give this press conference

2237
01:39:53,241 --> 01:39:56,200
and explained what the details are where
the president was found.

2238
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:57,110
Bethesda,
Maryland.

2239
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:59,030
What do you think?
That guy got his talking points as he

2240
01:39:59,031 --> 01:39:59,950
winging it,
you know,

2241
01:39:59,951 --> 01:40:02,240
they're not winging it.
Those guys were told what to say and

2242
01:40:02,241 --> 01:40:04,220
when to say it,
and they were put on television because

2243
01:40:04,221 --> 01:40:06,330
it was an easily controlled thing back
then there.

2244
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,510
The reporters on the site.
Sure.

2245
01:40:08,511 --> 01:40:10,970
But what do they know whether they know,
they know the president was dead and

2246
01:40:10,971 --> 01:40:12,150
then they took the president's body
away.

2247
01:40:12,151 --> 01:40:14,120
Everything else is information from the
government.

2248
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:15,191
Well,
I mean,

2249
01:40:15,191 --> 01:40:17,770
what does that mean?
Were they handed a press release that

2250
01:40:17,771 --> 01:40:20,830
says White House at the top and Said
told report this?

2251
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:22,090
Well,
it depends on where were they getting

2252
01:40:22,091 --> 01:40:22,920
their information.

2253
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:24,510
Depends on.
I mean there's many,

2254
01:40:24,511 --> 01:40:25,111
many,
many,

2255
01:40:25,111 --> 01:40:26,080
many outlets.
There's,

2256
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:27,480
there's different.
You know,

2257
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,670
doctors had talked about it.
There's different people who were on the

2258
01:40:29,671 --> 01:40:32,730
news.
There's Tom who is the guy who explained

2259
01:40:32,731 --> 01:40:35,850
it on television for the first time,
that classic speech that the president

2260
01:40:35,851 --> 01:40:38,300
has been shot.
Goddammit.

2261
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:41,580
Who was it that famous Daniel Grant?
I don't believe it was Dan Rather.

2262
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:43,350
I think.
I believe it was before his time.

2263
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,440
I want to say it doesn't.
I don't know.

2264
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:48,240
It's pointless.
The point is that where are they getting

2265
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:49,074
that information?

2266
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,560
I'm asking.
I don't see how the government fits in

2267
01:40:51,561 --> 01:40:53,860
that loop.
Will the government had body and they

2268
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:54,220
released

2269
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,630
a press statement.
That's fact.

2270
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:57,700
I mean they tell people that the
president has been shot.

2271
01:40:57,701 --> 01:41:00,300
The president's dead.
This is what's going on and you know

2272
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:03,490
when the news outlets,
whether it's local or national,

2273
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:04,690
ABC,
NBC,

2274
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:07,330
whatever it is,
they need to get the information from

2275
01:41:07,331 --> 01:41:09,430
the official source.
The official source would be someone

2276
01:41:09,431 --> 01:41:12,610
who's in the government that has a press
conference that explains the events as

2277
01:41:12,611 --> 01:41:13,444
they took place.

2278
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:15,033
Okay.
So

2279
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:18,090
what kind of spinning around in circles
here that might be annoying for people?

2280
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,220
I was,
yeah.

2281
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:22,430
I was basically going to circle where I
would say the same thing.

2282
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:27,270
We agree on more than we disagree on and
I think that what I'm trying to say is

2283
01:41:27,271 --> 01:41:31,620
that there's weirdness to the world and
that to automatically take the skeptical

2284
01:41:31,621 --> 01:41:35,700
position is oftentimes just as silly as
automatically taking the conspiratorial

2285
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:36,571
position.
Okay.

2286
01:41:36,571 --> 01:41:37,100
What do you mean

2287
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:39,410
by the skeptical position?
What do you mean when you say,

2288
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,040
uh,
from,

2289
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:42,290
from,
from you that I'm,

2290
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:45,440
I'm,
I'm getting the message that you think I

2291
01:41:45,441 --> 01:41:46,850
tend to take a silly position.

2292
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:47,680
No,
no,

2293
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,430
no.
Skeptical that it is silly to take this.

2294
01:41:51,431 --> 01:41:54,460
I don't want to be fooled.
Position just as foolish as it is

2295
01:41:54,461 --> 01:41:59,461
sometimes to take this blue double
double that either when Phil crazy,

2296
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:02,470
just as silly as it is to automatically
knee jerk,

2297
01:42:02,471 --> 01:42:05,590
take the conspiratorial position when we
know for a fact that certain

2298
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:07,990
conspiracies have not just been planned
out,

2299
01:42:07,991 --> 01:42:10,090
but had been executed,
whether it's the Gulf of Tonkin that led

2300
01:42:10,091 --> 01:42:12,220
us into Vietnam,
whether it's operation northwoods,

2301
01:42:12,221 --> 01:42:16,870
which was a planned attack on American
civilians and American military that was

2302
01:42:16,871 --> 01:42:21,070
signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
They were going to make a jetliner

2303
01:42:21,071 --> 01:42:23,410
explode.
They were going to arm Cuban friendlies

2304
01:42:23,411 --> 01:42:28,411
and have them attack Guantanamo Bay.
All of this to blame on the Cubans so

2305
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:31,210
that we could go to war with Cuba when
you know that that kind of information

2306
01:42:31,211 --> 01:42:34,720
exists and was real and it's provable
and it's in the freedom of Information

2307
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,610
Act releases when you know about all
that,

2308
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:38,830
that has to be factored into the,
uh,

2309
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:40,710
the spectrum of possibilities.
Okay?

2310
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,800
But you can't,
you can't

2311
01:42:41,910 --> 01:42:45,840
use the fact that there have been real
conspiracies and history.

2312
01:42:46,050 --> 01:42:51,050
You can't use that to defend conspiracy
theories because conspiracy theories as

2313
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:54,450
defined by the way you and I are
discussing them,

2314
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:59,190
our future predictions,
that conspiracy theory about nine slash

2315
01:42:59,191 --> 01:43:01,470
11 and having been an inside job,
for example,

2316
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:05,640
predict that one day it will be
discovered that the government

2317
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:07,590
orchestrated nine slash 11.
It's A.

2318
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:12,420
It's a prediction of evidence that will
someday have exist in the future and

2319
01:43:12,421 --> 01:43:14,880
future predictions really have never
come true.

2320
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:15,720
I,
I,

2321
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:18,540
I say that there.
I've said this in print many times,

2322
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:23,280
that there are no conspiracy theories
that have ever come true.

2323
01:43:24,200 --> 01:43:29,070
A conspiracy theory being something that
has existed as a theory among conspiracy

2324
01:43:29,071 --> 01:43:31,620
theorists unknown to the general public
unknown.

2325
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:32,910
I'll dispute that right away.

2326
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:35,430
That one.
What about the LSD experiments that they

2327
01:43:35,431 --> 01:43:36,264
did on civilians?

2328
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,970
That was,
that did not exist as a conspiracy

2329
01:43:38,971 --> 01:43:40,320
theory until it was discovered.

2330
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:41,380
Well,
most certainly did it.

2331
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:45,860
It just existed in my high school.
We talked about them doing lsd

2332
01:43:45,861 --> 01:43:48,050
experiments on soldiers.
It was an urban legend.

2333
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,870
It was a myth that they gave soldiers
lsd and they,

2334
01:43:50,871 --> 01:43:51,980
they,
they drag

2335
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,950
people to find out what the asset would
do to them and it rotted their brain

2336
01:43:54,951 --> 01:43:56,150
out.
We'd hear all these stories.

2337
01:43:56,520 --> 01:43:58,490
You could hear about it from people that
were in the military.

2338
01:43:58,491 --> 01:44:01,010
You're talking about Mk ultra.
I'm not talking about Mk ultra.

2339
01:44:01,011 --> 01:44:06,011
I'm talking about operation midnight
climax where the CIA drugged up people

2340
01:44:06,351 --> 01:44:10,340
that were in brothels in New York and
San Francisco so that they can study the

2341
01:44:10,341 --> 01:44:14,210
effects of Lsd on innocent civilians.
I'm talking about here.

2342
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:16,970
We're talking about.
So I think that was part of Mk ultra

2343
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,100
mean.
There was,

2344
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,550
there was a lot of programs related to
him.

2345
01:44:20,330 --> 01:44:22,010
Basically the same operation,
midnight,

2346
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:23,750
19 fifties,
forties,

2347
01:44:25,140 --> 01:44:26,030
fifties.
That's pretty early.

2348
01:44:26,090 --> 01:44:27,220
Well,
it was also the,

2349
01:44:27,221 --> 01:44:29,270
the various things that they did to
soldiers.

2350
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:33,050
Many of them documented to this day.
There were all legends at one point in

2351
01:44:33,051 --> 01:44:33,910
time.
Those were all the,

2352
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:37,090
the mind control experiments that they
did to Timothy.

2353
01:44:37,110 --> 01:44:38,360
Uh,
what's his name?

2354
01:44:38,361 --> 01:44:39,470
The unibomber.
What's his name?

2355
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:42,290
Tim [inaudible].
Ted Kaczynski.

2356
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,760
Ted Kaczynski.
He was a part of the,

2357
01:44:44,761 --> 01:44:45,594
uh,
the,

2358
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,240
the,
the Harvard Lsd Studies,

2359
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:49,880
Ted Kaczynski.
They fucking does that guy have with

2360
01:44:49,890 --> 01:44:51,320
acid.
I didn't know that as.

2361
01:44:51,330 --> 01:44:53,870
He was very cool.
There was a documentary on it,

2362
01:44:54,670 --> 01:44:59,390
I think it was called the net and it was
all about tracing back the roots of his

2363
01:44:59,391 --> 01:45:03,170
insanity to these,
these lsd experiments and that he may

2364
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,500
very well have signed up for something
that fried is fucking brain.

2365
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:06,970
Okay.
Let me,

2366
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:08,390
let me,
let me ask her something right now.

2367
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:11,000
Ask.
I'd like to ask your listeners of whom

2368
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:15,880
you have,
how many don't know what we're talking

2369
01:45:15,890 --> 01:45:20,360
about more than it definitely.
I'd like to ask for all of all of Joe's

2370
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:23,480
listeners out there,
if you have an example of a conspiracy

2371
01:45:23,481 --> 01:45:28,481
theory that existed as a theory among
conspiracy theorist before it became

2372
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:32,150
generally known by law enforcement,
media,

2373
01:45:32,180 --> 01:45:32,721
general,
public,

2374
01:45:32,721 --> 01:45:33,554
whatever.

2375
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,250
Please let me know.
Email me,

2376
01:45:35,251 --> 01:45:39,830
Brian at [inaudible] dot com because I
still maintain that there are none and I

2377
01:45:39,831 --> 01:45:43,040
would love to be proven wrong about this
and what the what Alex Jones said,

2378
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:45,230
isn't that a conspiracy theory that
turned out to be true that the

2379
01:45:45,231 --> 01:45:47,930
government is spying on your emails and
listening to all your phone.

2380
01:45:47,990 --> 01:45:50,900
That wasn't something that was known
only to conspiracy theorists.

2381
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:52,640
That was something that's.
I mean that's.

2382
01:45:52,970 --> 01:45:54,230
That wasn't surprising.
I,

2383
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:57,620
I can tell you because you were in the
number of the people who were in that

2384
01:45:57,621 --> 01:45:58,820
industry.
That doesn't surprise me,

2385
01:45:58,850 --> 01:46:02,510
but from someone like me,
it was very surprising and for people

2386
01:46:02,511 --> 01:46:04,820
that were listening to the official
government story,

2387
01:46:04,821 --> 01:46:06,270
it was absolutely contradicting.
Okay,

2388
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:09,380
and the first time you learned about
teen conspiracy theories,

2389
01:46:09,381 --> 01:46:10,550
that turned out to be true.
Let's read.

2390
01:46:10,670 --> 01:46:11,503
Okay.
Yeah.

2391
01:46:11,920 --> 01:46:15,320
You're funny.
I hear your voice is not objective,

2392
01:46:15,321 --> 01:46:16,154
sir.

2393
01:46:16,730 --> 01:46:21,680
Cancer viruses into other vaccines.
Atm Machines will someday use facial

2394
01:46:21,681 --> 01:46:23,750
recognition technology.
Yeah,

2395
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:26,030
but those are silly.
Those are not conspiracy theories.

2396
01:46:26,031 --> 01:46:29,030
That's just prognosticating.
This is just crazy.

2397
01:46:29,031 --> 01:46:29,751
And projecting.
Well,

2398
01:46:29,751 --> 01:46:32,300
there must be something in there.
The US government and Monsanto are

2399
01:46:32,301 --> 01:46:35,630
teaming up against opponents of agenda,
kinetically modified food.

2400
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:41,110
It's not a conspiracy theory.
It's not know kind of is that the US

2401
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:45,260
government and Monsanto are teaming up
to make money pro wrestling's fake.

2402
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:46,730
Whoa.
That's not real.

2403
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,560
Shut the fuck up,
dude.

2404
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:50,460
Do.
Don't break my break.

2405
01:46:50,461 --> 01:46:54,720
My word world in half a scientists all
over the world are creating extremely

2406
01:46:54,721 --> 01:46:57,060
bizarre human animal hybrids.
Okay.

2407
01:46:57,061 --> 01:46:58,070
Is this true?
Not long ago,

2408
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:02,460
Chinese scientists embedded genes for
human milk proteins into a mouse genome

2409
01:47:02,461 --> 01:47:05,670
and have since created herds of
humanized milk producing.

2410
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,750
Well,
that's just ignorance.

2411
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:08,280
They don't understand what what's going
on there.

2412
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,290
They.
They're not making human hybrids.

2413
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:14,010
They're just utilizing genes for certain
specific actions.

2414
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:16,770
Using a cell phone could cause cancer.
Yeah.

2415
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:19,250
That's not been proven unless you talked
to Sheryl Crow.

2416
01:47:20,410 --> 01:47:23,460
Crow thinks she got a brain tumor from
listening to the cell phone all the

2417
01:47:23,461 --> 01:47:25,560
time.
Fluoride is harmful for your teeth.

2418
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:26,880
Okay.
Is that true?

2419
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:30,060
Department of Health and Human Services
and environmental protection agency are

2420
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:33,750
proposing the change because of an
increase in fluorosis,

2421
01:47:33,751 --> 01:47:37,380
a condition that causes spotting and
streaking of children's teeth.

2422
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:40,750
These are not conspiracy theories.
This is a bad promotions of anti

2423
01:47:40,751 --> 01:47:43,210
science.
This is stupid prescription drugs kill

2424
01:47:43,211 --> 01:47:45,120
large numbers of Americans to the
fucking.

2425
01:47:45,121 --> 01:47:46,770
Everything kills people,
but if somebody,

2426
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:50,400
if someone out there does have a
conspiracy theory that turned out to be

2427
01:47:50,401 --> 01:47:53,160
true,
please email me at [inaudible] dot com.

2428
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:55,290
I would.
I would love to be able to report on it.

2429
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,780
One of those,
one of the most,

2430
01:47:57,510 --> 01:48:01,770
one of those common episode requests I
get is for conspiracy theories that

2431
01:48:01,771 --> 01:48:05,010
turned out to be true and I always
answered that email with the same thing.

2432
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:05,610
I said,
great.

2433
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:07,620
Give me a suggestion.
I've been looking for him.

2434
01:48:07,730 --> 01:48:12,540
A lot of the times they confuse
incompetence with conspiracy as well.

2435
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:15,270
Like here's one.
The Federal Reserve is a perpetual debt

2436
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:16,990
machine that is designed to create
inflation.

2437
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:20,550
Then it goes onto to show the US
national debt has gotten more than 5,000

2438
01:48:20,551 --> 01:48:23,850
times larger than the value of the US
dollar has fallen by more than 96

2439
01:48:23,851 --> 01:48:25,230
percent.
I think that's more of an example of

2440
01:48:25,231 --> 01:48:28,800
greed and incompetence and just fucking
fools running things than it is a

2441
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:32,250
massive conspiracy to diminish the
wealth of the United States.

2442
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:34,350
Just people are stealing from the
system.

2443
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:37,170
That's all it is.
They put cancer viruses in our vaccines

2444
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:39,840
because you know this Brian Denny,
I know that they've got all kinds of

2445
01:48:39,841 --> 01:48:42,390
different things in vaccines for
different purposes and a lot of the

2446
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:47,391
times what the things that people report
like there are a boarded fetal tissue in

2447
01:48:47,431 --> 01:48:52,431
vaccines that's not completely untrue.

2448
01:48:52,830 --> 01:48:57,830
There are a certain certain certain
lines that can only be grown in human

2449
01:48:58,201 --> 01:49:02,640
tissue and so there's two particular
lines of fetal tissue that have existed

2450
01:49:02,641 --> 01:49:06,360
for boy,
I think they're 40 or so years old now.

2451
01:49:06,361 --> 01:49:11,130
These two particular lines and we grow
the cultures in those in those tissues

2452
01:49:11,131 --> 01:49:14,640
have a human tissue and then the.
The.

2453
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:17,700
The cultures are removed from the tissue
once in a while.

2454
01:49:17,701 --> 01:49:20,940
Have spare cell or something will get
stuck in and be included with the

2455
01:49:20,941 --> 01:49:24,120
vaccine,
but it's not harmful in any way and it's

2456
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:26,580
kind of misrepresents the white happens
to say that,

2457
01:49:26,581 --> 01:49:29,790
uh,
we include human fetal tissue in

2458
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:33,150
vaccines.
Someone sent me one that's legit.

2459
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:34,950
The Gulf of Tonkin incident never
happened.

2460
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:37,170
That was a conspiracy theory long before
it was ever proven.

2461
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:39,180
True.
That's true.

2462
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:44,190
I haven't done an episode on that.
That's been a frequent request.

2463
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:45,840
I'll put that.
I'll put that,

2464
01:49:45,900 --> 01:49:48,130
bump that to the top of my.
That's a real one,

2465
01:49:48,310 --> 01:49:50,620
but I have a feeling that you're going
to somehow or another shaded so that

2466
01:49:50,621 --> 01:49:54,910
everything's gonna be okay.
You're going to dance around it and make

2467
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:55,790
it seem like,
listen,

2468
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:59,830
don't worry about me.
What about the Gulf of Tonkin was known

2469
01:49:59,831 --> 01:50:03,880
only to conspiracy theorists before law
enforcement slash media slash whoever

2470
01:50:03,881 --> 01:50:05,320
got ahold of it.
That's a good question.

2471
01:50:05,610 --> 01:50:06,300
Uh,
well,

2472
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:07,640
that's,
that's what we're looking for.

2473
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:09,490
How about the fact that it happened at
all?

2474
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,470
That they,
they actually did fake this incident

2475
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:16,360
that is established historical facts.
But that's saying that a conspiracy

2476
01:50:16,361 --> 01:50:17,140
happened.
Sure.

2477
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:19,870
But that's not the same thing as a
conspiracy theory happened,

2478
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:22,350
but no,
it was serious theorist who were,

2479
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:25,690
who were shouting about it on the street
corners before it was discovered by the

2480
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:27,550
general public or by law enforcement.

2481
01:50:27,850 --> 01:50:30,610
Really.
Sure that that was something that people

2482
01:50:30,611 --> 01:50:32,290
had talked about.
I don't know.

2483
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:36,040
I mean obviously I'm too young to know,
but the Gulf of Tonkin conspiracy.

2484
01:50:36,041 --> 01:50:38,470
But I mean that's,
that's the information I'm looking for.

2485
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,050
Yeah.
I wouldn't have conspiracy theorists

2486
01:50:41,500 --> 01:50:42,340
who,
you know,

2487
01:50:42,370 --> 01:50:46,720
from their New York apartment basements
or wherever they were figured out these

2488
01:50:46,721 --> 01:50:48,330
things.
Yeah.

2489
01:50:48,450 --> 01:50:50,830
I don't,
I can't say before with people who

2490
01:50:50,831 --> 01:50:52,330
should have known about them,
found out about them.

2491
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,250
What about Watergate?
Well,

2492
01:50:54,251 --> 01:50:56,340
that's not really a conspiracy theory.
What that is,

2493
01:50:56,341 --> 01:50:58,960
is just standard operational procedure
amongst crux.

2494
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:01,780
And then one guy got busted.
There was,

2495
01:51:01,810 --> 01:51:05,380
there was nobody knew that was Alex
Jones was not on his radio shows

2496
01:51:05,381 --> 01:51:07,480
screaming about what happened about
Watergate.

2497
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:10,000
Well,
he was a baby Bernstein and Woodward

2498
01:51:10,001 --> 01:51:11,200
report.
It wasn't even a baby.

2499
01:51:11,201 --> 01:51:12,310
He wasn't even born then.
Alex,

2500
01:51:12,311 --> 01:51:14,230
he's younger than me.
He looks like he's 60,

2501
01:51:14,350 --> 01:51:15,940
but he's like,
I think it's 40.

2502
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:16,751
Really?
Yeah.

2503
01:51:16,751 --> 01:51:18,010
He's a young guy.
When I first met him,

2504
01:51:18,011 --> 01:51:20,230
I believe he was 28 is actually younger
than me.

2505
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:22,060
Correctly.
That's depressing.

2506
01:51:22,061 --> 01:51:23,290
Yeah,
he does look pretty bad.

2507
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:25,240
Doesn't he?
Fucking burns at both ends.

2508
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:26,950
Alex.
I'm sorry if you're listening.

2509
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:27,760
He says,
sweetie,

2510
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,170
Jesus,
he's a sweetie.

2511
01:51:29,171 --> 01:51:30,580
But yeah,
he's fucking.

2512
01:51:30,581 --> 01:51:31,181
Look,
if you,

2513
01:51:31,181 --> 01:51:33,370
your whole day was doing gloom and new
world order,

2514
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,590
he'd be shitting your pants too.
Um,

2515
01:51:35,710 --> 01:51:37,930
I don't know if we got anywhere with any
of this talk,

2516
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:39,970
but we still have plenty of time.
So,

2517
01:51:39,971 --> 01:51:40,870
um,
let's,

2518
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:42,010
let's,
let's continue.

2519
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:46,920
I think I could shed light on a faulty
thinking that I have had myself please.

2520
01:51:47,050 --> 01:51:48,330
And I think,
um,

2521
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:53,500
I think that confirmation bias and that
you can go online and find French sites

2522
01:51:54,701 --> 01:51:58,240
and all these different things that
support your ideas and then not

2523
01:51:58,241 --> 01:52:00,510
objectively look at it like completely
objective.

2524
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:03,820
We all get attached.
We get our egos attached to statements

2525
01:52:03,821 --> 01:52:06,070
and we get our egos attached to
positions that we've taken.

2526
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,110
And I think that those,
those,

2527
01:52:08,260 --> 01:52:12,100
those egos and those statements and
positions that we've taken oftentimes

2528
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:17,101
can be the enemy of objectivity.
And I agree with you that there are

2529
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:20,170
most.
I wouldn't say most things,

2530
01:52:20,350 --> 01:52:23,350
but when you're looking at information
online,

2531
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:26,830
what you should do is look at all the
different arguments,

2532
01:52:26,831 --> 01:52:29,700
pro and con,
and then look where the intelligence is

2533
01:52:29,710 --> 01:52:31,630
liquid.
Look where the smart people are leaning.

2534
01:52:31,631 --> 01:52:33,430
Look where the educated people are
leaning liquid.

2535
01:52:33,431 --> 01:52:36,310
The experts are leaning and try to
figure it out and also know that no

2536
01:52:36,311 --> 01:52:41,220
matter what there is in this world,
if you haven't been there and you know

2537
01:52:41,230 --> 01:52:43,270
you're,
you're reading someone's take on it,

2538
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:46,190
there's going to be a bunch of different
opposing

2539
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:49,580
opinions that make no fucking sense.
There's going to be some that are close.

2540
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:53,930
There's going to be the full range from
from fucking whack a doodle.

2541
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:57,740
The planes were holograms.
There was explosions that were looking

2542
01:52:57,741 --> 01:52:59,300
at.
This is not a civilian plane.

2543
01:52:59,540 --> 01:52:59,961
You know,
they,

2544
01:52:59,961 --> 01:53:00,241
they,
they,

2545
01:53:00,241 --> 01:53:03,860
they took the people to the moon.
There's this wackadoodle shit on,

2546
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:06,530
on every subject,
everything that exists.

2547
01:53:06,531 --> 01:53:08,320
And some of it you have to wonder,
you know,

2548
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:12,590
we know that there's techniques and
tactics of disinformation while they'll

2549
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:14,510
take a bunch of things that are
absolutely true.

2550
01:53:14,511 --> 01:53:17,180
Then attachment to one thing that's
blatantly ridiculous,

2551
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:20,510
and that one thing sort of diminishes
all the other things.

2552
01:53:21,410 --> 01:53:25,640
One thing that I always tell people and
I always get criticized for it is if you

2553
01:53:25,641 --> 01:53:30,641
have a question on any given matter,
go to the experts in that,

2554
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:32,660
in that subject,
if you want to know,

2555
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:37,190
you know how old the earth is,
go to the people who actually work in

2556
01:53:37,191 --> 01:53:39,320
that field.
You're not always going to be right,

2557
01:53:39,321 --> 01:53:41,630
but you're going to be right far more
often than you're wrong.

2558
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:45,140
So no matter what the question is,
what the pseudo sciences,

2559
01:53:45,141 --> 01:53:46,610
for example,
you know,

2560
01:53:46,630 --> 01:53:49,160
a cancer bullshit,
cancer remedies.

2561
01:53:49,460 --> 01:53:54,460
If you want to know whether this works,
go to go to the experts in cancer,

2562
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:58,030
go to the American cancer society,
et Cetera,

2563
01:53:58,031 --> 01:53:59,870
et cetera.
You won't always be right,

2564
01:53:59,871 --> 01:54:01,270
but you'll be right far more often

2565
01:54:01,400 --> 01:54:03,460
then you're wrong.
We had a real problem with that on our

2566
01:54:03,461 --> 01:54:05,890
show with um,
Peter Duesberg.

2567
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:09,640
Peter Duesberg,
who's a professor of biology at the

2568
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:10,473
University of California,
Berkeley,

2569
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:14,050
uh,
esteemed scholar who also believes that

2570
01:54:14,051 --> 01:54:18,610
HIV doesn't cause aids and we had him on
the podcast and it was unbelievably

2571
01:54:18,611 --> 01:54:21,940
baffling and my statement was,
it's very frustrating when you're too

2572
01:54:21,941 --> 01:54:25,210
dumb to know who stupid,
but it was listening to him and

2573
01:54:25,211 --> 01:54:29,050
listening to the absolute outrage of all
the actual scientists that work in the

2574
01:54:29,051 --> 01:54:33,460
field of HIV research and how angry
people were about it.

2575
01:54:33,461 --> 01:54:37,870
And unfortunately I couldn't get anybody
to debate him and I think that much like

2576
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:42,250
people are criticizing Bill Nye of
visiting the creation museum is almost

2577
01:54:42,251 --> 01:54:44,830
like people don't want to debate
holocaust deniers.

2578
01:54:44,860 --> 01:54:48,670
They did not want to debate this guy
because somehow or another it gives his

2579
01:54:48,671 --> 01:54:49,504
ideas.

2580
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,730
Yeah.
And I agree with that.

2581
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:56,440
I would say just let them hang out in
the wind for anyone with any credibility

2582
01:54:56,441 --> 01:54:58,510
to spend time on that.
You're just,

2583
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:01,210
you're communicating to the general
public that there's a question here that

2584
01:55:01,211 --> 01:55:03,310
needs to be looked at and that's not
right.

2585
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:04,280
Yeah.

2586
01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:06,620
It's baffling though.
It's really confusing when you have this

2587
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:08,870
guy.
It was just an incredibly intelligent

2588
01:55:08,871 --> 01:55:13,160
man who's very well respected in
educated and has done some amazing work

2589
01:55:13,161 --> 01:55:15,290
on cancer research as well.
So even since then,

2590
01:55:15,291 --> 01:55:16,124
so it's,
it's,

2591
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:17,533
it's baffling.

2592
01:55:17,610 --> 01:55:18,000
Okay.
Let me,

2593
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,880
let me ask you something else.
I want to kind of call you out a little

2594
01:55:20,881 --> 01:55:22,690
bit on something else.
Um,

2595
01:55:23,490 --> 01:55:25,980
it's call you out of some new shit that
people are doing in the last 10 years.

2596
01:55:25,990 --> 01:55:27,010
No sense.
Right on.

2597
01:55:27,011 --> 01:55:27,440
It was.
No,

2598
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,590
that's good.
Before that,

2599
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:33,960
nobody ever did any conspiracy theorists
believed that there would calling them.

2600
01:55:34,410 --> 01:55:34,921
So.
Okay.

2601
01:55:34,921 --> 01:55:37,410
You had a guy on your show a couple of
weeks ago.

2602
01:55:37,411 --> 01:55:38,580
I tried to listen when I come on the
show,

2603
01:55:38,581 --> 01:55:41,890
I try to listen to some recent episodes.
You had a guy on who was a doctor Dr

2604
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:44,460
something or rather Gordon.
Mark.

2605
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,640
Mark Gordon Martin.
Okay.

2606
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:48,990
I,
I listened to that episode.

2607
01:55:48,991 --> 01:55:51,510
I,
I turned it off in a rage at nine

2608
01:55:51,511 --> 01:55:53,440
minutes because I couldn't take anymore.
Okay.

2609
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:57,060
He came on and I believe you said you'd
had them on several times before.

2610
01:55:57,061 --> 01:55:57,691
Is that right?
No,

2611
01:55:57,691 --> 01:55:58,524
he's my friend.
Okay.

2612
01:55:58,540 --> 01:56:01,080
You know,
the guy he came on and he starts

2613
01:56:01,081 --> 01:56:05,550
promoting his miracle supplement that
you take and you can drink as much

2614
01:56:05,551 --> 01:56:07,140
alcohol as you want,
not to get drunk.

2615
01:56:07,200 --> 01:56:08,340
Well,
he's talking about glutathione.

2616
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:09,680
It wasn't,
wasn't saying it was me.

2617
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:13,170
He was selling a product that you can
take it and you know he doesn't sell.

2618
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:16,470
It doesn't sell gludethyon.
I might.

2619
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:18,400
He might beg to differ.
That was the.

2620
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:20,600
That was the central thrust of the first
nine minutes.

2621
01:56:20,620 --> 01:56:22,520
The episode I listened,
but what I want,

2622
01:56:22,610 --> 01:56:24,670
what I want,
I might be correct or incorrect.

2623
01:56:24,750 --> 01:56:26,760
What I want to discuss with you is
something you said to him,

2624
01:56:26,761 --> 01:56:29,790
you said,
you said that sounds too good to be

2625
01:56:29,791 --> 01:56:30,700
true.
[inaudible].

2626
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,420
I wish I knew enough to call you out on
your bullshit.

2627
01:56:33,750 --> 01:56:34,583
Right.

2628
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:39,030
You should have.
You should have known enough to call

2629
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:40,290
them out on your bullshit.
I didn't know he was gonna.

2630
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:41,790
Bring that up if you're going to.
Well,

2631
01:56:41,791 --> 01:56:42,271
I mean,
okay.

2632
01:56:42,271 --> 01:56:43,270
What?
It wasn't like this.

2633
01:56:43,310 --> 01:56:46,200
The topic of conversation,
like when when I have some on the show,

2634
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:49,530
the the idea of having people in the
show is just a conversation just with

2635
01:56:49,531 --> 01:56:50,310
you.
There's no.

2636
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:51,500
We didn't discuss much.
We said,

2637
01:56:51,510 --> 01:56:52,860
let's just have fun.
Let's just talk.

2638
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,100
The same thing with mark.
Mark is a friend of mine and he's an

2639
01:56:56,110 --> 01:56:58,920
interesting guy and he can ramble on
forever and relay all sorts of

2640
01:56:58,921 --> 01:57:01,110
information.
He's also an expert in traumatic brain

2641
01:57:01,111 --> 01:57:02,520
injury,
has helped a lot of soldiers,

2642
01:57:02,521 --> 01:57:05,040
helped a lot of athletes,
have a lot of football players,

2643
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:07,140
mixed martial arts fighters,
boxers.

2644
01:57:07,330 --> 01:57:09,420
He's.
He's helped a lot of people understand

2645
01:57:09,421 --> 01:57:12,660
the delicate balance of the of the human
mind and here's the thing,

2646
01:57:12,661 --> 01:57:12,990
is he.

2647
01:57:12,990 --> 01:57:15,660
He went on,
he came on your show and told people

2648
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:18,930
that here's a supplement they can take
and drink all they want and not get

2649
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:20,460
drunk.
That gets people killed.

2650
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:23,760
People said that and and use,
right though.

2651
01:57:24,180 --> 01:57:25,200
No,
he's not right.

2652
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:26,940
What happens when you take Gludethyon if
you drunk?

2653
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:29,970
Does it have any effect?
The body is a lot more complicated than

2654
01:57:29,971 --> 01:57:32,520
that.
It's a great example that I like to give

2655
01:57:32,521 --> 01:57:36,270
of this is the idea of oxidation and
antioxidants.

2656
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:39,050
Oxidation causes aging.
It causes bad thing,

2657
01:57:39,051 --> 01:57:42,420
so take an antioxidant and that sounds
really simple,

2658
01:57:42,421 --> 01:57:46,080
but it's far more complex than that and
in fact it's so complicated.

2659
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:47,610
That statement doesn't even mean
anything.

2660
01:57:47,611 --> 01:57:49,200
It's one of these things.
It's so wrong.

2661
01:57:49,201 --> 01:57:50,910
It's not even wrong.
As the saying goes,

2662
01:57:51,180 --> 01:57:55,890
you can't just take something that's
produced in your liver and counter

2663
01:57:55,950 --> 01:57:58,800
effect counteract the effects of
drinking alcohol.

2664
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:04,280
There is no direct line from anything
you eat to any part of your body.

2665
01:58:04,950 --> 01:58:06,840
If you take,
if you're working out,

2666
01:58:06,841 --> 01:58:10,770
if you're trying to get buff and you
take a protein supplement,

2667
01:58:10,830 --> 01:58:11,551
you thinking,
hey,

2668
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:13,920
protein coming in,
that's going to go to my muscles and

2669
01:58:13,921 --> 01:58:16,800
help them get strong.
That's something that is

2670
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:23,320
incredibly wrong because it,
but it sounds so simplistically true.

2671
01:58:24,010 --> 01:58:26,530
It's not correct.
That's not the way the body works.

2672
01:58:26,531 --> 01:58:28,480
That's not the way the digestion system
works.

2673
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:32,920
You cannot take something orally and
have it go as a direct line to any given

2674
01:58:32,921 --> 01:58:35,410
part of your body.
That's not the way our digestive system

2675
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:39,790
and our blood works and when you say
that there's a supplement that can

2676
01:58:39,791 --> 01:58:41,290
prevent you from getting drunk,
your,

2677
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:43,180
I'm sorry,
your,

2678
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:47,290
your against all reasonably established
science and you're trying to.

2679
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:50,770
You're trying to make a buck off of
people potentially getting killed and I

2680
01:58:50,771 --> 01:58:53,380
had a huge problem with that to the
point that I had to turn the show off.

2681
01:58:54,010 --> 01:58:56,900
I was just getting mad driving in my car
and.

2682
01:58:57,460 --> 01:58:58,121
Okay,
keep going.

2683
01:58:58,121 --> 01:59:01,720
Sorry.
I think that that as someone with a huge

2684
01:59:01,721 --> 01:59:04,660
audience as you have,
I think you have more of a

2685
01:59:04,661 --> 01:59:08,830
responsibility to make sure that people
like that are called out on it.

2686
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:10,210
If you can.
If you don't,

2687
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:13,090
if he surprises you with it,
then say,

2688
01:59:13,150 --> 01:59:15,580
okay,
then I've got to get someone on next

2689
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:16,420
week.
I got to go and get,

2690
01:59:16,450 --> 01:59:16,960
you know,
uh,

2691
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:21,340
Steven Novella or someone like that.
Someone who is a promoter of science

2692
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:25,240
based medicine to counteract that
because I think you could have left some

2693
01:59:25,241 --> 01:59:27,160
of your listeners with the impression
that hey,

2694
01:59:27,161 --> 01:59:31,180
they can now buy something and drink all
they want and then drive home safely.

2695
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:32,530
Um,
okay.

2696
01:59:32,530 --> 01:59:34,810
I'm,
I'm looking online and immediately I

2697
01:59:34,811 --> 01:59:37,450
find articles that discussed glutathione
and it's,

2698
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:40,160
it's role,
vital role in alcohol,

2699
01:59:40,161 --> 01:59:43,850
detoxification in the liver.
It binds to the toxin,

2700
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,870
a civilized which s s,
w a subtle d high,

2701
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:49,340
I don't know what else to tell to hide
as.

2702
01:59:49,341 --> 01:59:51,680
Thank you,
which is a byproduct is a product of

2703
01:59:51,681 --> 01:59:54,920
alcohol and is 10 to 30 times more toxic
than the alcohol itself.

2704
01:59:55,130 --> 01:59:58,820
Gludethyon then transfer.
Say it again after what asked to tell,

2705
01:59:58,821 --> 02:00:02,420
to hide,
to hide into compounds that can be

2706
02:00:02,421 --> 02:00:05,270
excreted.
Alcohol therefore depletes our store of

2707
02:00:05,271 --> 02:00:09,020
glutathione when depleted by excessive
alcohol consumption,

2708
02:00:09,021 --> 02:00:13,730
gludethyon becomes unavailable for
normal and natural antioxidant effects

2709
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:17,660
leading to a host of health problems,
and this article is actually saying that

2710
02:00:17,661 --> 02:00:19,370
you should take glutathione when you
drink.

2711
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:20,090
What you're talking about

2712
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:22,730
about is reducing the effects of a
hangover,

2713
02:00:22,731 --> 02:00:26,210
getting over the hangover quickly.
It does not underscored,

2714
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:30,300
does not prevent you from getting drunk
or in any way mitigate the,

2715
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:31,213
the,
the

2716
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:34,200
intox alcohol effects of the also it
doesn't diminish it or shrink it.

2717
02:00:34,201 --> 02:00:36,960
Like as if he said he does,
that's a believable one of his

2718
02:00:36,961 --> 02:00:38,490
statements were,
is that when you were drunk you could

2719
02:00:38,491 --> 02:00:39,690
take this stuff and it would,
uh,

2720
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,550
it would bring you back to baseline
rather quick.

2721
02:00:41,680 --> 02:00:43,780
That is not true.
You can reduce the effects of a

2722
02:00:43,781 --> 02:00:46,510
hangover,
but you cannot prevent yourself from

2723
02:00:46,511 --> 02:00:46,970
getting.

2724
02:00:46,970 --> 02:00:49,130
Have you ever tried this?
Do you know this for a fact?

2725
02:00:49,700 --> 02:00:51,190
I've never tried his product.
No,

2726
02:00:51,210 --> 02:00:51,520
no,
no.

2727
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:53,900
I mean it's not as product.
Luda is available pretty much

2728
02:00:53,901 --> 02:00:55,430
everywhere.
I mean you could buy it in health food

2729
02:00:55,431 --> 02:00:56,510
stores.
You can buy it online.

2730
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:00,280
I have never tried anyone's product that
was intended as a

2731
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:04,330
miracle drunk cure.
But I mean it would make sense though

2732
02:01:04,331 --> 02:01:07,090
that if alcohol and alcohol consumption
and the,

2733
02:01:07,120 --> 02:01:09,160
the,
the reaction that has in the body,

2734
02:01:09,161 --> 02:01:12,670
it's a chemical reaction that there
could be possibly something that could

2735
02:01:12,671 --> 02:01:14,770
counterbalance it or swing it in one way
or another.

2736
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:17,770
Just like many other chemical reactions
and symbiotic reactions that we have to

2737
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:20,680
things inside the body.
Now when you read something about this,

2738
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:24,970
it seems like what you're,
your dispute is that he said that it

2739
02:01:24,971 --> 02:01:28,270
could diminish the effects of alcohol,
like while you're drunk and you're

2740
02:01:28,271 --> 02:01:31,000
saying that's not true.
It just helps with the hangover.

2741
02:01:31,001 --> 02:01:33,190
Yes.
If it helps with a hangover,

2742
02:01:33,191 --> 02:01:34,870
it's still really potent and pretty
interesting.

2743
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,330
Um,
I would like to do a test on it.

2744
02:01:37,331 --> 02:01:40,310
I would like to see two people's blood
alcohol levels measured.

2745
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:41,990
I think if you don't do that test.
Yeah,

2746
02:01:42,020 --> 02:01:43,880
you're,
you fucking saying something kind of

2747
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:45,320
irresponsible.
Which he did.

2748
02:01:45,500 --> 02:01:47,000
I don't know if that test has been done
though.

2749
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:48,583
Do you?

2750
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:53,690
I have not searched the literature for
what if it has been done and he's right

2751
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:57,230
then that would have.
That would have been all over the

2752
02:01:57,231 --> 02:01:59,570
literature.
What is someone who feels follows the

2753
02:01:59,571 --> 02:02:02,330
literature fairly closely?
I can tell you that it has not been all

2754
02:02:02,331 --> 02:02:05,270
over the literature that you can now
drink and not get drunk.

2755
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,760
Well,
I mean maybe he was exaggerating.

2756
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:10,490
I think he was exaggerating because he
was selling a product.

2757
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:11,980
That's what it was

2758
02:02:11,990 --> 02:02:13,970
because he doesn't have a store.
He doesn't have anything.

2759
02:02:13,971 --> 02:02:14,804
I,
he's not.

2760
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:17,120
When you say selling a product,
whereas he selling out of.

2761
02:02:17,570 --> 02:02:18,440
He doesn't have a store.

2762
02:02:18,490 --> 02:02:20,760
I don't really look,
this was the nine minutes of his

2763
02:02:20,770 --> 02:02:22,570
episode.
He was talking about what he sells.

2764
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:25,780
If I'm wrong about that,
then I'm damn wrong about it.

2765
02:02:25,781 --> 02:02:29,800
And I'm surprised.
This is another thing is that is a thing

2766
02:02:29,801 --> 02:02:33,670
that's talking about a saving you from
being too drunk because of taking

2767
02:02:33,671 --> 02:02:36,220
glutathione before you drink.
Where are you seeing it?

2768
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:39,110
Uh,
some fucking journal.

2769
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:40,280
There's,
there's a,

2770
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:43,220
there's a long look.
It's impossible to have a conversation

2771
02:02:43,221 --> 02:02:44,840
and Google things.
That's true.

2772
02:02:45,590 --> 02:02:46,550
But,
uh,

2773
02:02:46,730 --> 02:02:48,080
it's also one,
uh,

2774
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:50,810
there's a,
a scientific article on reddit about

2775
02:02:50,811 --> 02:02:53,240
large amounts of glutathione,
uh,

2776
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:58,241
have the potential to sober people up in
a very short time that we're researching

2777
02:02:58,401 --> 02:02:59,570
a chemical drug.
This is.

2778
02:02:59,630 --> 02:03:00,321
Listen,
man,

2779
02:03:00,321 --> 02:03:02,120
there's not,
he's not the only one that's talking

2780
02:03:02,121 --> 02:03:04,820
about this.
This is being discussed in many

2781
02:03:04,821 --> 02:03:07,250
different forms.
I don't know if he's right or wrong,

2782
02:03:07,251 --> 02:03:11,150
but I don't think you do either.
I would like to have him on with someone

2783
02:03:11,151 --> 02:03:13,910
who disputes it and find out,
but that's what I would recommend.

2784
02:03:13,911 --> 02:03:18,911
He's a very smart guy and he wasn't
saying that many outlandish things where

2785
02:03:19,011 --> 02:03:22,370
I'd have to pull them down like the
towers were destroyed by Tesla

2786
02:03:22,371 --> 02:03:24,290
technology.
That's not the same doctor.

2787
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,210
Yeah,
he's a pretty reasonable guy.

2788
02:03:26,211 --> 02:03:27,470
He's a little bit out there.
You know?

2789
02:03:27,471 --> 02:03:29,470
He's kind of Wacky,
but literacy out there.

2790
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:31,190
Oh,
he's out there on.

2791
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:34,750
A
good thing to say is out there.

2792
02:03:35,530 --> 02:03:37,820
I don't know.
I'd have to listen to her to go over.

2793
02:03:37,821 --> 02:03:41,110
I liked the guy a lot.
I'm very biased when it comes to him.

2794
02:03:41,120 --> 02:03:42,920
He's a fun guy and he's very,
very smart,

2795
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:47,900
but I'm looking at more than one thing
that's showing that you could advance

2796
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:50,870
your sobriety,
but you could sober up quicker by taking

2797
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:54,050
glutathione.
I don't know if they're right or he's

2798
02:03:54,051 --> 02:03:55,820
right or you're right,
but I don't know.

2799
02:03:55,821 --> 02:03:57,170
I don't know that you should be saying
that.

2800
02:03:57,171 --> 02:03:59,060
If you're not a doctor,
what if it turns out?

2801
02:03:59,061 --> 02:03:59,894
That is true.

2802
02:03:59,910 --> 02:04:00,940
I'm,
I'm not a doctor,

2803
02:04:00,941 --> 02:04:02,530
but I'm,
I'm a science writer and I,

2804
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:04,540
I do google.
I do follow this stuff.

2805
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:07,090
I've written on Google.
I did an episode.

2806
02:04:07,091 --> 02:04:08,380
Uh Oh,
probably three,

2807
02:04:08,381 --> 02:04:13,381
four months ago on a hangover.
What exactly is the cause of a hangover?

2808
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,210
What's,
what's the nature of the toxicity?

2809
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:20,410
He could use that information when it's
a really complicated subject.

2810
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:23,590
It's an immunosuppressant.
The dehydration.

2811
02:04:23,591 --> 02:04:24,610
There's a lot of factors,
right?

2812
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:27,520
Yeah.
And it basically comes down to a,

2813
02:04:28,530 --> 02:04:30,460
it's a depletion of glutathione in your
body.

2814
02:04:30,461 --> 02:04:33,640
Can't keep up with it.
Sounds like Dr Gordon's,

2815
02:04:33,641 --> 02:04:34,330
right?
No,

2816
02:04:34,330 --> 02:04:37,290
it's not as simple as that.
That's the thing is it's easy to sell

2817
02:04:37,291 --> 02:04:38,220
products by giving

2818
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,590
an oversimplified description.
I'm telling you though,

2819
02:04:40,591 --> 02:04:41,011
you like,
you're,

2820
02:04:41,011 --> 02:04:43,290
you're pinning it on this guy.
He doesn't have a store.

2821
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:45,090
Like you're saying,
he's selling products.

2822
02:04:45,091 --> 02:04:46,560
He's not,
he's not selling anything.

2823
02:04:47,090 --> 02:04:49,950
He,
he was certainly talking about a product

2824
02:04:49,951 --> 02:04:51,320
that's available.
Not his,

2825
02:04:51,900 --> 02:04:53,640
but he was,
he was talking to me about it even

2826
02:04:53,641 --> 02:04:56,080
before the podcast that he takes it.
Um,

2827
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:57,180
I know,
uh,

2828
02:04:57,210 --> 02:05:01,500
Dave asprey from bulletproof exec.
He takes a glutathione but he never

2829
02:05:01,501 --> 02:05:03,880
brought up anything about it doing
anything for,

2830
02:05:03,881 --> 02:05:05,250
uh,
for alcohol.

2831
02:05:05,251 --> 02:05:05,560
Okay.
Well,

2832
02:05:05,560 --> 02:05:07,380
I,
I would just like to leave you with,

2833
02:05:07,410 --> 02:05:11,700
with the,
my opinion that sense listeners got the

2834
02:05:11,701 --> 02:05:14,040
impression that here's something that
they can take and drink.

2835
02:05:14,041 --> 02:05:17,610
All they want,
not get drunk is potentially lethal

2836
02:05:17,611 --> 02:05:18,390
advice.
Yes.

2837
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:21,090
Who else got that information?
Who me.

2838
02:05:21,690 --> 02:05:26,250
I don't know if it's right either me and
the listeners got fed some information

2839
02:05:26,251 --> 02:05:26,970
that we don't know what's right.

2840
02:05:26,970 --> 02:05:29,400
I don't have any obligation other than
to talk to people.

2841
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:32,190
My obligation is to ask questions if I'm
curious,

2842
02:05:32,191 --> 02:05:34,870
but in broadcasting this things,
I make the,

2843
02:05:34,910 --> 02:05:37,200
the,
the very clear distinction that I'm not

2844
02:05:37,201 --> 02:05:38,730
an expert.
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking

2845
02:05:38,731 --> 02:05:42,030
about when I'm talking about things like
health and medicine and,

2846
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:45,060
but I'm fascinating.
So if I'm talking to someone and they're

2847
02:05:45,061 --> 02:05:47,600
an expert and they bring up something
that I didn't prepare for,

2848
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,410
I'm going to ask him questions about it.
And you know,

2849
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,920
I will say I wish I knew if you're full
of shit,

2850
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:56,790
but that's about as good as I could do.
The reason I had the reason I initially

2851
02:05:56,791 --> 02:05:59,610
did this episode,
excuse me five years ago,

2852
02:05:59,611 --> 02:06:04,611
about celebrities who promote harmful
pseudoscience is because when you have a

2853
02:06:05,521 --> 02:06:08,250
large audience,
I believe you do have an obligation to

2854
02:06:08,251 --> 02:06:09,990
not give harmful information.

2855
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:13,080
But I'm not giving it.
I don't think for a minute that you've

2856
02:06:13,081 --> 02:06:15,750
ever knowingly given any harmful
information.

2857
02:06:15,751 --> 02:06:19,380
I'm not accusing you of anything at all.
But if it has been given by one of your

2858
02:06:19,381 --> 02:06:22,020
guests and you are in the position of
having to say,

2859
02:06:22,950 --> 02:06:24,990
that sounds too good to be true.
I wish I was.

2860
02:06:25,110 --> 02:06:27,570
I wish I knew enough to call you out on
your bullshit.

2861
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,770
Um,
it seems to me like a reasonable step to

2862
02:06:31,771 --> 02:06:34,920
follow that up with would have been to
find out with

2863
02:06:36,510 --> 02:06:38,400
get somebody on who can,
who can,

2864
02:06:38,401 --> 02:06:40,140
uh,
who can address the other side of that

2865
02:06:40,141 --> 02:06:43,170
question.
Perhaps I can turn this around on you

2866
02:06:43,171 --> 02:06:47,100
and say it would be so easy for.
You have to research all those different

2867
02:06:47,101 --> 02:06:49,410
things on that list that you accused me
of many of them,

2868
02:06:49,411 --> 02:06:51,750
which are not true at all and never have
been true,

2869
02:06:51,751 --> 02:06:52,830
but yet you printed them.

2870
02:06:52,890 --> 02:06:54,270
I did.
So why did you do that?

2871
02:06:54,271 --> 02:06:57,630
If you're a man of science information,
would you possibly have had?

2872
02:06:57,631 --> 02:07:00,890
Because I was using the Internet in 2008
and I look,

2873
02:07:01,230 --> 02:07:02,250
look every,
every,

2874
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:03,830
every,
probably three,

2875
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:06,090
four months or so.
I do an episode that is nothing but

2876
02:07:06,091 --> 02:07:08,640
corrections,
corrections of things I've been wrong

2877
02:07:08,641 --> 02:07:11,640
about in the past.
I think that's a great plan.

2878
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:14,520
I think it's great that I do that.
I want to continue doing it.

2879
02:07:14,670 --> 02:07:16,740
I will need more things to be wrong
about so I can produce.

2880
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:19,620
Those episodes were often,
but what you vote is very specific and

2881
02:07:19,621 --> 02:07:23,850
what I want and what I came here today
to do was to find out which of those are

2882
02:07:23,851 --> 02:07:26,800
wrong and so that I will correct them.
Yeah,

2883
02:07:26,801 --> 02:07:29,580
but even this one thing you just said he
wasn't selling it,

2884
02:07:29,730 --> 02:07:31,890
but you got that wrong,
but you're saying that he was selling.

2885
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,440
That wasn't on my show.
I was listening to this show it wrong

2886
02:07:35,441 --> 02:07:36,130
and you're saying it's

2887
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:40,360
true and so now you're sending it out to
the road that this guy sells a product.

2888
02:07:40,361 --> 02:07:42,340
He doesn't.
You're doing the exact same thing that

2889
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:46,240
you're blaming joe for.
No,

2890
02:07:46,241 --> 02:07:46,790
I'm not.
I,

2891
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:49,300
I.
You are though.

2892
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:51,450
You're saying this guy sells something
when he doesn't.

2893
02:07:51,690 --> 02:07:54,790
Yeah.
You said that's hardly the salient

2894
02:07:54,791 --> 02:07:56,620
point.
The salient point is that information is

2895
02:07:56,621 --> 02:07:58,270
being given that could potentially kill
people.

2896
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:00,670
Right,
but your information

2897
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:03,820
as a medical expert,
which he is under the guise of selling a

2898
02:08:03,821 --> 02:08:05,500
product which is erroneous.

2899
02:08:05,540 --> 02:08:06,111
Okay,
but I've.

2900
02:08:06,111 --> 02:08:08,540
I've also said that I don't know whether
it's his store,

2901
02:08:08,541 --> 02:08:10,790
someone else's store,
but it's a product that he's talking

2902
02:08:10,791 --> 02:08:13,910
about that's the salient point.
Whether it's his store,

2903
02:08:13,911 --> 02:08:16,850
someone else's store doesn't really make
a lick of difference compared to the

2904
02:08:16,851 --> 02:08:17,930
fact that it's potentially

2905
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:22,330
saying that he doesn't believe in it or
that if he believes in it he's wrong and

2906
02:08:22,331 --> 02:08:24,820
when he's saying is that he uses it,
he doesn't sell it.

2907
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,550
And you're saying that he's saying that
because he sells it.

2908
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:30,760
That was very specific.
You had taken this very cynical approach

2909
02:08:30,761 --> 02:08:32,270
to why he's disseminating this
information.

2910
02:08:32,271 --> 02:08:33,071
Fair enough,
and,

2911
02:08:33,071 --> 02:08:35,710
and I'm,
I'm right now if I said that I was wrong

2912
02:08:35,711 --> 02:08:36,550
on this,
sweetie,

2913
02:08:36,551 --> 02:08:37,384
you,

2914
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:39,430
and that's to say that these aren't dumb
people.

2915
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:41,830
They can't realize that they're drunk
and they're taking a pill and they're

2916
02:08:41,831 --> 02:08:42,341
going to go,
well,

2917
02:08:42,341 --> 02:08:44,580
I said,
I said to him why I was.

2918
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:46,900
That sounds like horse shit.
You did.

2919
02:08:47,110 --> 02:08:48,310
You did,
but I don't know.

2920
02:08:48,311 --> 02:08:49,840
I mean,
he's a fucking smart guy.

2921
02:08:49,870 --> 02:08:52,060
Like I,
I know for a fact that that guy has

2922
02:08:52,061 --> 02:08:54,280
helped a lot of people with traumatic
brain injury.

2923
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:57,070
That's a different subject,
but he's a doctor.

2924
02:08:57,071 --> 02:09:00,910
He's a legit scientist and a doctor.
I mean he's a really brilliant guy.

2925
02:09:01,030 --> 02:09:05,420
So when he talks to me about the issues
with a pituitary gland and impacts and

2926
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:09,910
his expertise on the human mind,
that relates to me that he has a very

2927
02:09:09,911 --> 02:09:11,830
vast understanding of the human body
itself.

2928
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:14,200
When he tells me something like this and
then I started reading that,

2929
02:09:14,201 --> 02:09:17,590
there's more than one different article
that sort of confirms what he's saying.

2930
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:21,160
I don't know if you're right.
You might've gotten harsh on my friend

2931
02:09:21,161 --> 02:09:24,060
Dr Gordon for no reason,
I think.

2932
02:09:24,070 --> 02:09:25,330
I think it's a very good reason.

2933
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:27,460
I.
If if he's giving,

2934
02:09:27,790 --> 02:09:30,550
he's giving advice that's potentially
killing people.

2935
02:09:30,850 --> 02:09:35,290
I think that's a very good reason to err
on the side of this information should

2936
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:36,370
be.
Should be checked.

2937
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:39,580
That's true,
but if you're so dumb that you're just

2938
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,790
just pound in alcohol and trusting the
glutathione is going to do it,

2939
02:09:42,791 --> 02:09:44,890
it's going to kill you.
That's a Darwin award winner.

2940
02:09:45,550 --> 02:09:50,550
If you're using spotify on to fucking
know he's not saying drink all you want

2941
02:09:51,731 --> 02:09:52,750
and you're going to be fine.
I mean,

2942
02:09:52,751 --> 02:09:55,020
he never said that.
He never said there's no risk involved.

2943
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:57,910
What he was saying is it can help you
get sober quicker.

2944
02:09:57,911 --> 02:10:00,160
I don't know if he's right,
but I don't think you do either.

2945
02:10:00,760 --> 02:10:02,690
That's not what I heard.
What you.

2946
02:10:02,730 --> 02:10:05,260
What did you hear?
I heard him say you can drink and not

2947
02:10:05,261 --> 02:10:08,020
get drunk.
We can listen to it on the Internet.

2948
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:10,040
See if you could pull it up.
So you give pull.

2949
02:10:10,080 --> 02:10:13,360
If there's a very small sample that we
could find.

2950
02:10:13,590 --> 02:10:15,400
Yeah,
I think we're kind of splitting hairs

2951
02:10:15,401 --> 02:10:19,120
here.
I could see why you'd be upset and I

2952
02:10:19,121 --> 02:10:22,840
could see why you would think that I
have the responsibility to call someone

2953
02:10:22,841 --> 02:10:25,090
out.
I would have to be the expert on a

2954
02:10:25,090 --> 02:10:27,230
million different things and then I
would have to have people on and have

2955
02:10:27,231 --> 02:10:31,780
people counteract them and have people
go back and forth and debates and that's

2956
02:10:31,781 --> 02:10:36,110
all well and good in the real world.
If you can organize those debates and if

2957
02:10:36,111 --> 02:10:39,380
you get those people together,
but for the most part I'm lucky to get

2958
02:10:39,381 --> 02:10:42,500
someone to sit down once.
I'm lucky to get someone who can fit

2959
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:45,470
into a times that I have and have them
on the show and I just want to have a

2960
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:46,370
conversation with them.

2961
02:10:46,580 --> 02:10:48,890
I didn't have any idea that God was
going to bring up glutathione.

2962
02:10:49,110 --> 02:10:51,650
In fact,
we wanted to highlight his work on

2963
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:55,490
traumatic brain injury because there's a
big issue with mixed martial arts these

2964
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:59,090
days and the big issue is there's
twofold.

2965
02:10:59,330 --> 02:11:03,560
One traumatic brain injury and to the
depletion of testosterone because of

2966
02:11:03,561 --> 02:11:06,770
traumatic brain injury.
It's been shown in people that have come

2967
02:11:06,771 --> 02:11:11,420
back from war and suffered a head
injuries and it's been shown from boxers

2968
02:11:11,421 --> 02:11:16,310
and people that have sustained long term
even subconcussive impacts to the head

2969
02:11:16,311 --> 02:11:21,311
that the pituitary gland gets fucked up
and he's trying to sort of spread this

2970
02:11:21,651 --> 02:11:26,120
information and keep fighters from
taking testosterone to counteract that

2971
02:11:26,121 --> 02:11:28,730
and then competing to and continuing to
compete,

2972
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:33,470
continuing to damage the brain.
And it's an issue in mixed martial arts

2973
02:11:33,471 --> 02:11:36,230
and it's one of the reasons why I had
him on because he's a,

2974
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:37,160
he's a brilliant guy.

2975
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:40,430
And um,
he is very troubled by this idea that

2976
02:11:40,431 --> 02:11:43,910
we're going to put a bandaid on
traumatic brain injury by giving these

2977
02:11:43,911 --> 02:11:46,850
guys testosterone use exemptions.
He thinks it's wrong.

2978
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:51,680
He thinks if your body is producing less
testosterone because of impacts,

2979
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:54,950
you shouldn't give it testosterone and
continue receiving impacts.

2980
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,380
That was the whole premise for him
coming on the show in the first place.

2981
02:11:57,381 --> 02:11:59,690
So for me,
I felt like I,

2982
02:11:59,691 --> 02:12:02,390
um,
he's the smartest person I know in

2983
02:12:02,391 --> 02:12:06,470
regards to this particular subject.
So I felt it was kind of important to

2984
02:12:06,471 --> 02:12:08,840
discuss it with them.
I have no idea that's glutathione shit

2985
02:12:08,841 --> 02:12:10,190
was going to come up with,
but here's what he said.

2986
02:12:10,191 --> 02:12:12,140
We're going to pick up after you drink
and you take them.

2987
02:12:12,720 --> 02:12:14,100
What is the,
what is it?

2988
02:12:14,220 --> 02:12:17,850
Unbelievable gludethyon pull that thing
closer to your face so people hear you

2989
02:12:17,851 --> 02:12:19,230
better.
Glutathione,

2990
02:12:19,231 --> 02:12:23,190
glutathione and that.
That helps your liver when you drink

2991
02:12:23,191 --> 02:12:24,030
alcohol.
Well,

2992
02:12:24,060 --> 02:12:28,260
it helps you with just about anything
that delivers responsible for I'm

2993
02:12:29,070 --> 02:12:34,070
digesting or metabolizing.
As you metabolize certain drugs,

2994
02:12:35,041 --> 02:12:38,670
chemicals and so forth.
The liver uses up its ability to

2995
02:12:39,270 --> 02:12:42,580
continue the process so it spills over
into the blood and that's how you get a,

2996
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:45,330
you know,
drunk because your liver can only deal

2997
02:12:45,331 --> 02:12:47,970
with a certain amount,
so if you replenish or replace the

2998
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,240
glutathione in the liver,
you get an incredible benefits of it.

2999
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:55,590
Not only does it help with metabolism,
but it's an incredible antioxidant for

3000
02:12:55,591 --> 02:12:57,450
the brain and for the eyes and for the
heart.

3001
02:12:57,930 --> 02:13:00,660
What is it made out of a.
it's three amino acids that are

3002
02:13:00,661 --> 02:13:02,010
together.
It's in our body,

3003
02:13:02,011 --> 02:13:06,790
but we don't have enough of it to really
generate the metabolism that we needed

3004
02:13:06,810 --> 02:13:08,850
for drinking and where do they get that?

3005
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:11,340
Where do they get glutathione,
because I know Dave asprey's really into

3006
02:13:11,341 --> 02:13:14,190
that stuff too.
Version of it's manufactured,

3007
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:17,190
but how do they make it?
What is a three amino acids that they

3008
02:13:17,191 --> 02:13:22,110
put together and the products that we
interact with?

3009
02:13:22,140 --> 02:13:24,720
Our HRA,
it's a delivery technology.

3010
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:29,900
We're wrap the vitamins or you wrap the
supplement in a what's called a,

3011
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:36,380
which is like a cell wall,
so from lecithin is from soy and it

3012
02:13:36,511 --> 02:13:38,790
protects whatever it is that you're
ingesting.

3013
02:13:39,150 --> 02:13:41,760
A lot of the things that you take,
like I think I shared with you,

3014
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:44,940
if you take a thousand milligrams of
vitamin C by mouth,

3015
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:48,390
you only absorb 19 percent.
The rest of it is destroyed by the acid

3016
02:13:48,570 --> 02:13:51,360
in the stomach,
but if you wrap it in this protection

3017
02:13:51,361 --> 02:13:55,470
called the light bulbs home,
you'll be able to absorb 93 percent.

3018
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:59,450
So taking something like Glutathione,
which normally when you take it in in

3019
02:13:59,460 --> 02:14:02,010
its natural form,
it's destroyed.

3020
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:03,790
Most of it is destroyed and then
absorbed,

3021
02:14:03,830 --> 02:14:07,830
then remanufactured in the blood,
but if you wrap it in this protective

3022
02:14:07,831 --> 02:14:09,150
outer coating,
a Lyposomal,

3023
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:12,900
you can absorb it more readily and their
effects are unbelievably positive.

3024
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:17,280
For instance,
a gentleman who went out drinking three

3025
02:14:17,281 --> 02:14:21,150
high balls and five shots of Tequila
went home and subsequently was very

3026
02:14:21,151 --> 02:14:22,170
dizzy,
nauseous.

3027
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:27,480
He forgot that I gave them a sample of a
this glutathione and he's used four

3028
02:14:27,481 --> 02:14:30,360
puffs under the tongue,
held it for 30 seconds,

3029
02:14:30,361 --> 02:14:33,330
and then 30 minutes later,
clear Isabelle woke up the next day,

3030
02:14:33,331 --> 02:14:35,010
went out partying again.
Couldn't get drunk.

3031
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:38,610
Wow.
That sounds like nonsense.

3032
02:14:38,870 --> 02:14:39,630
It isn't.

3033
02:14:39,630 --> 02:14:41,370
So I was smart enough to call you on
your bullshit.

3034
02:14:42,350 --> 02:14:44,010
Talk to my office,
Aaron.

3035
02:14:44,020 --> 02:14:46,230
Okay.
Everything sounds crazy.

3036
02:14:46,231 --> 02:14:47,520
Maybe that guy will cut her off right
there.

3037
02:14:47,521 --> 02:14:49,500
Maybe when I was actually at the
beginning of the podcast,

3038
02:14:49,510 --> 02:14:51,780
I remember that was about where I got
mad and that was right in.

3039
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,580
Um,
I don't buy the.

3040
02:14:53,581 --> 02:14:55,020
He says he couldn't get drunk the next
day.

3041
02:14:55,021 --> 02:14:57,750
That's very anecdotal though.
And what he was saying was just hard

3042
02:14:57,751 --> 02:15:00,570
science.
What a good doctor is not going to go

3043
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:04,290
and tell people anecdotes like you can
take this product and not get drunk.

3044
02:15:04,440 --> 02:15:06,330
I agree,
and maybe he was nervous being on a

3045
02:15:06,331 --> 02:15:07,680
podcast.
You probably shouldn't have said it.

3046
02:15:07,681 --> 02:15:08,700
No Man,
a million people.

3047
02:15:08,701 --> 02:15:10,560
Plus they're going to listen to it.
However,

3048
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:14,400
what he said was all hard science.
What he said was,

3049
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:18,570
okay,
here are the things he said that led me

3050
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:22,460
to believe that it was his product at
least obviously here where you would

3051
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:22,740
watch it.

3052
02:15:22,740 --> 02:15:23,670
Again,
it wasn't as product.

3053
02:15:23,671 --> 02:15:24,600
He wasn't selling.
He said,

3054
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:26,430
he said,
I gave him the supplement and you said,

3055
02:15:26,431 --> 02:15:28,290
here's the delivery thing that we're
working on,

3056
02:15:28,291 --> 02:15:30,660
so maybe I misinterpreted that.
Let me tell you something about this

3057
02:15:30,661 --> 02:15:32,310
guy.
He's a very generous guy and he gives

3058
02:15:32,311 --> 02:15:33,690
people the vitamins all the time.
He's like,

3059
02:15:33,691 --> 02:15:34,650
here,
try this out.

3060
02:15:34,890 --> 02:15:37,900
This has been taken.
This is an incredible amino acid.

3061
02:15:37,901 --> 02:15:40,740
It's Baba Baba grapeseed and he's just
a.

3062
02:15:41,370 --> 02:15:42,900
He gives things out to people.
Okay,

3063
02:15:43,050 --> 02:15:44,280
here's the he,
he.

3064
02:15:44,310 --> 02:15:47,130
He said,
it has all of these amazing effects in

3065
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:48,480
your heart,
your brain,

3066
02:15:48,481 --> 02:15:50,070
your eyes,
antioxidants,

3067
02:15:50,100 --> 02:15:54,660
and he's using language like
extraordinary and amazing and in my

3068
02:15:54,661 --> 02:15:56,820
experience,
in my experience,

3069
02:15:56,821 --> 02:16:00,930
dealing with many quacks of many
different duck species.

3070
02:16:01,410 --> 02:16:04,860
If it looks on quacks like when it's
usually a quack and he was using very

3071
02:16:04,861 --> 02:16:07,700
quack like language and making very
quick points.

3072
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:11,010
I don't know anybody accused,
you could accuse him of hyperbole,

3073
02:16:11,011 --> 02:16:14,340
but what he's saying is essentially hard
science about the Lyposomal,

3074
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:19,580
the digesting of nutrients using the
lyposomal method as opposed to just

3075
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:21,720
normally being broken down by stomach
acids.

3076
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:23,730
All the things he's saying.
It's not that ridiculous.

3077
02:16:23,731 --> 02:16:24,001
Yeah,
I mean,

3078
02:16:24,001 --> 02:16:26,160
when you.
If you usually take something,

3079
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:28,560
if I.
If you take some kind of an enzyme or

3080
02:16:28,561 --> 02:16:29,650
something in your mouth,

3081
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,950
your saliva is going to start breaking
it down into their constituent amino

3082
02:16:32,951 --> 02:16:36,490
acids right away and you're right.
It's what he said was right.

3083
02:16:36,491 --> 02:16:39,790
It's not going to get used as
glutathione in your body.

3084
02:16:39,850 --> 02:16:42,760
Those amino acids are going to go their
separate ways and become used for

3085
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:45,100
whatever else your body actually is
looking for.

3086
02:16:45,101 --> 02:16:47,860
At the time,
I don't know about his particular

3087
02:16:47,861 --> 02:16:50,790
delivery method that he's talking about,
but when he says it's not his

3088
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:53,290
guaranteed,
I don't know about this stuff,

3089
02:16:53,320 --> 02:16:55,540
the particular delivery method he's
talking about,

3090
02:16:55,541 --> 02:16:58,210
but when he says,
you can take a thousand milligrams of

3091
02:16:58,211 --> 02:17:00,880
vitamin C and your body's going to
absorb 93 percent of it,

3092
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:06,240
that's in my experience medically
nonsensical and your body doesn't need

3093
02:17:06,460 --> 02:17:09,370
that much.
Will your body doesn't use that 93

3094
02:17:09,371 --> 02:17:11,830
percent of what though?
What are the vitamin C you took in your

3095
02:17:12,020 --> 02:17:14,710
thousand,
but what if it's a small amount?

3096
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:17,430
If he's saying that your body absorbs 93
percent of vitamin C's,

3097
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:20,170
not saying that you need a thousand
milligrams in your body absorbs 93

3098
02:17:20,171 --> 02:17:22,330
percent.
What he's saying that if you deliver it

3099
02:17:22,331 --> 02:17:26,380
in a lyposomal form,
you get a 93 percent bioavailability.

3100
02:17:26,560 --> 02:17:29,260
He's not giving a specific number that
you should take.

3101
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:31,570
He was saying that if you take vitamin
C,

3102
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:35,160
most of it gets destroyed unless you use
it Lyposomal,

3103
02:17:35,310 --> 02:17:38,920
which I think is correct,
but your body doesn't have any use for

3104
02:17:38,921 --> 02:17:41,270
93 percent of a thousand milligrams of
vitamin C.

3105
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:44,950
He didn't say that.
He didn't say you need a thousand

3106
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:46,690
milligrams and then 93 percent of it is
absorbed.

3107
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:48,700
What he said is if you take it light but
Somali,

3108
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:52,600
it's a higher rate of vial availability
and it's up to 93 percent.

3109
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:54,790
He didn't say you have to take 100
milligrams.

3110
02:17:55,170 --> 02:17:57,950
Do you think she was implying that it's
better to have a dosage?

3111
02:17:57,950 --> 02:18:00,880
She was trying to say that it's better
to have lyposomal vitamin C because it's

3112
02:18:00,881 --> 02:18:02,980
more bioavailable.
That's all hard sciences.

3113
02:18:02,981 --> 02:18:05,380
I was a better.
If it's going to give you more than you

3114
02:18:05,381 --> 02:18:06,430
can use,
how is it better?

3115
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:07,780
No,
you're adding that.

3116
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:10,300
He didn't say that you have to have a
thousand milligrams.

3117
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:13,780
What he said is that if you take it,
19 percent is going to get absorbed.

3118
02:18:13,781 --> 02:18:15,070
You'd take it through the traditional
method.

3119
02:18:15,071 --> 02:18:16,390
If you take it light,
so molly,

3120
02:18:16,630 --> 02:18:19,610
then you get 93 percent absorption.
He didn't give you a dose it.

3121
02:18:19,630 --> 02:18:23,320
He wasn't saying he wasn't suggesting or
implying that that's them to be wrong.

3122
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:24,330
Siren.
This is not.

3123
02:18:24,331 --> 02:18:25,360
This is not cool.
Look,

3124
02:18:25,361 --> 02:18:27,700
I'm just.
I'm just saying it looks and quacks like

3125
02:18:27,701 --> 02:18:29,800
a duck generous,
which you're saying is disingenuous

3126
02:18:29,801 --> 02:18:32,260
because that's not what he's saying.
What what he's saying there was that the

3127
02:18:32,290 --> 02:18:36,370
bioavailability of lipel symbol
nutrients is better and that's true.

3128
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:39,180
You're saying that he's saying a
thousand milligrams in Europe.

3129
02:18:39,181 --> 02:18:41,080
Point of contention is you don't need a
thousand milligrams.

3130
02:18:41,200 --> 02:18:44,680
He never said you need a thousand
milligrams of Lyposomal vitamin C.

3131
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:48,000
all he said was that when you take
vitamin C,

3132
02:18:48,030 --> 02:18:50,050
lipel stumbling.
Your body absorbs it better.

3133
02:18:50,500 --> 02:18:52,780
Whether it says what it's really 93
percent.

3134
02:18:53,200 --> 02:18:53,861
Okay.
Yeah,

3135
02:18:53,861 --> 02:18:54,700
it is.
Look at this.

3136
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:59,910
Fuck they're saying on a live and labs
lyposomal science.

3137
02:19:00,720 --> 02:19:05,650
I'm saying a bioavailability,
a vial of bioavailability of 98 percent.

3138
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:08,500
There's another one that says over 90
percent.

3139
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:12,010
So what he's saying is true.
What he's saying is fact,

3140
02:19:12,070 --> 02:19:13,630
and you're.
You're shitting on it because you don't

3141
02:19:13,631 --> 02:19:17,050
want them to be right about what I think
you're correct about is this,

3142
02:19:17,051 --> 02:19:19,900
this idea,
this anecdotal story of a guy,

3143
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:21,250
you know,
taking this stuff,

3144
02:19:21,251 --> 02:19:23,920
feeling better 30 minutes later and then
the next day couldn't get drunk.

3145
02:19:23,950 --> 02:19:27,070
That sounds like bullshit to me too,
but all that other stuff that he said,

3146
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:28,610
that's all science.

3147
02:19:29,500 --> 02:19:33,400
I'm shitting on anyone who is selling
snake oil.

3148
02:19:33,430 --> 02:19:37,780
Basically come on pitching snake oil to
be bought or suggesting that that buying

3149
02:19:37,781 --> 02:19:41,650
supplements and things that you don't
need is a good way to spend your money.

3150
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:44,160
But wait a minute.
If someone likes to drink isn't a smart

3151
02:19:44,161 --> 02:19:47,370
thing to take glutathione after you
drank to to shorten your hangover.

3152
02:19:47,520 --> 02:19:48,360
Isn't that effective?

3153
02:19:49,360 --> 02:19:51,810
I would have to look at the research
before I would tell you

3154
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:54,160
you said it.
You said it before you said that it.

3155
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:57,790
It aids in reducing hangover.
Okay.

3156
02:19:57,791 --> 02:19:58,624
Yeah.
So it.

3157
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:02,230
So why wouldn't you take that?
You're saying that he's selling

3158
02:20:02,231 --> 02:20:05,650
something that you don't need.
It's not as simple as that,

3159
02:20:05,770 --> 02:20:06,371
but wait a minute.
Wait.

3160
02:20:06,371 --> 02:20:09,370
None of these issues are as simple as
saying it is,

3161
02:20:09,371 --> 02:20:09,811
but uh,
you're,

3162
02:20:09,811 --> 02:20:14,350
you're saying that you take glutathione
when you're hung over and it reduces the

3163
02:20:14,351 --> 02:20:16,270
length of your hangover.
He saying,

3164
02:20:16,330 --> 02:20:19,560
take glutathione.
You're saying saying to take glutathione

3165
02:20:19,570 --> 02:20:21,910
is unnecessarily.
You're saying that you don't need it

3166
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:23,440
when needed.
You don't need nutrients.

3167
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:26,620
You could live on cheeseburgers and get
to be fucking 60 years old.

3168
02:20:26,621 --> 02:20:30,160
Just eating shitty food.
That doesn't mean it doesn't mean your

3169
02:20:30,161 --> 02:20:33,850
life isn't enhanced by raw vegetables
and nutrients and having a balanced

3170
02:20:33,851 --> 02:20:34,780
diet.
You,

3171
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:38,140
you saying that you don't need
glutathione is pretty ridiculous.

3172
02:20:38,230 --> 02:20:40,870
If you can get glutathione into your
liver,

3173
02:20:40,871 --> 02:20:43,540
you will,
your hangover will be reduced.

3174
02:20:43,541 --> 02:20:47,680
So why don't you either.
This method of taking a supplement will

3175
02:20:47,681 --> 02:20:50,980
get glutathione into your liver is
something that I don't know and I would

3176
02:20:50,981 --> 02:20:53,300
have to look at the research before I
would tell you that you're already in.

3177
02:20:53,301 --> 02:20:55,710
I will tell you being wrong,
I'm,

3178
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:59,830
I'm accusing him being wrong,
that you can take a product and not get

3179
02:20:59,831 --> 02:21:03,640
drunk after trying,
trying to get drunk and not able to get

3180
02:21:03,641 --> 02:21:05,560
drunk.
I'm saying that that's wrong and it

3181
02:21:05,561 --> 02:21:08,430
borders on being really,
really unethical.

3182
02:21:08,431 --> 02:21:08,810
He wrong.

3183
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:11,420
We agree on that,
but you've set up all sorts of Straw man

3184
02:21:11,421 --> 02:21:15,050
arguments for why he did it and what
he's doing and what he's saying and the

3185
02:21:15,260 --> 02:21:18,590
bioavailability of vitamin C in those
all fall under the fall apart under

3186
02:21:18,591 --> 02:21:20,390
scrutiny,
so let's have him come on and correct it

3187
02:21:20,400 --> 02:21:23,940
this time to come on and debate you.
He doesn't know you wouldn't get it.

3188
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:26,130
I'd get I'd get someone who knows the
business.

3189
02:21:26,430 --> 02:21:26,900
He said,
look,

3190
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:30,440
he's a silly guy and sometimes he might
speak in hyperbole,

3191
02:21:30,441 --> 02:21:35,441
but what he's saying that you corrected
your wrong about about bio availability.

3192
02:21:35,780 --> 02:21:39,590
You attributed him to this erroneous
number of a thousand milligrams.

3193
02:21:39,591 --> 02:21:40,970
He didn't say that.
He did not.

3194
02:21:40,971 --> 02:21:42,680
Did you want to play?
Let's play it again.

3195
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:43,940
Let's play again.
The light bulbs,

3196
02:21:43,990 --> 02:21:45,460
Samo,
we don't need to play.

3197
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:49,670
If you take a thousand milligrams of
vitamin C and ut and a and you take it

3198
02:21:49,671 --> 02:21:51,350
Lyposomal,
you'll absorb 93

3199
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:54,320
and it's not what he said.
What he said was,

3200
02:21:54,321 --> 02:21:56,300
if you take a thousand milligrams of
vitamin C,

3201
02:21:56,301 --> 02:21:59,000
your body only absorbs 19 percent,
and he said,

3202
02:21:59,001 --> 02:22:00,980
if you take vitamin C,
Lipids Soumala,

3203
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:05,390
your body absorbs a giant amount of it.
He said 19 percent and 93 percent.

3204
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:06,830
That's what he said.
He didn't say,

3205
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:10,310
you know,
you're saying you don't need that much

3206
02:22:10,311 --> 02:22:13,520
vitamin C and that's why he's wrong,
but high levels of vitamin C,

3207
02:22:13,521 --> 02:22:16,790
that's debatable as well because high
levels of vitamin C have been shown to

3208
02:22:16,791 --> 02:22:19,640
be potent antioxidants that could
prevent against certain types of

3209
02:22:19,641 --> 02:22:21,620
diseases.
A lot of people think it boosts your

3210
02:22:21,621 --> 02:22:24,680
immune system.
It helps fight off various pathogens.

3211
02:22:24,681 --> 02:22:28,650
There's a lot of research hard data that
shows that high levels of vitamin C is

3212
02:22:28,651 --> 02:22:29,760
probably pretty good for you.

3213
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:31,750
In my research,
all of that has turned out to be

3214
02:22:31,751 --> 02:22:34,660
nonsense.
Your research on vitamin C is extensive?

3215
02:22:34,780 --> 02:22:36,880
Yes.
What's your research on vitamin C?

3216
02:22:36,910 --> 02:22:38,770
God,
I can look up my episode for you.

3217
02:22:38,771 --> 02:22:40,090
I mean,
it was a few years ago.

3218
02:22:40,150 --> 02:22:43,510
We talked mostly about it.
It was invented by a course linus

3219
02:22:43,511 --> 02:22:46,300
pauling,
who by this time in his career was

3220
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:51,220
something of a crank and came up with
this notion that vitamin,

3221
02:22:51,221 --> 02:22:55,480
Mega dosing would cure cancer,
and he wrote the book called

3222
02:22:58,810 --> 02:23:01,750
can't remember the name of his book,
but that's essentially what started off

3223
02:23:01,751 --> 02:23:05,050
the whole vitamin and supplement
movement that still exists very strongly

3224
02:23:05,051 --> 02:23:09,310
to this day.
And what we have found by testing is

3225
02:23:09,311 --> 02:23:12,550
that vitamin C does not significantly
affect cancer.

3226
02:23:12,551 --> 02:23:14,590
The length or duration or severity of a
cold,

3227
02:23:14,620 --> 02:23:17,020
etc. Etc.
All of thEse things that we take it for,

3228
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:23,230
this caused a great rift between him and
science and he spent most of the rest of

3229
02:23:23,231 --> 02:23:25,810
his career,
which was fairly short because he was

3230
02:23:25,811 --> 02:23:27,770
quite elderly by that time.
Uh,

3231
02:23:27,820 --> 02:23:30,460
basically widening that rift and
debating with,

3232
02:23:30,461 --> 02:23:32,410
uh,
with the medical profession and trying

3233
02:23:32,411 --> 02:23:37,150
to defend his vitamin mega dosing idea.
And what you'll find now,

3234
02:23:37,151 --> 02:23:40,780
I mean this is pretty much everywhere in
recent scientific literature,

3235
02:23:40,781 --> 02:23:45,070
is the idea that vitamins really don't
do anything for you because very few

3236
02:23:45,071 --> 02:23:48,160
people have vitamin deficiencies and you
still have health

3237
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:50,430
list evidence demonstrating that vitamin
c's,

3238
02:23:50,431 --> 02:23:54,660
anticancer properties that high levels
of vitamin c kills cancer.

3239
02:23:54,930 --> 02:23:56,640
This is the national institute of health

3240
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:59,530
and read the whole thing.
I bet you anything that's talked about

3241
02:23:59,531 --> 02:24:03,290
in vitro,
in vitro or ivy you mean?

3242
02:24:03,450 --> 02:24:07,060
You mean in vitro means if you put
something in a petri dish and you put

3243
02:24:07,061 --> 02:24:10,000
some cells in there and you pour
something in it and it kills the cells

3244
02:24:10,220 --> 02:24:12,910
that's in vitro.
It's got very little to do with

3245
02:24:13,240 --> 02:24:16,180
institute,
which has means actually doing some

3246
02:24:16,181 --> 02:24:17,470
tests in your body.
So

3247
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:19,600
the ivc,
is that what they would call it?

3248
02:24:20,140 --> 02:24:22,150
High dose ivc.
Is that in vitro?

3249
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,780
No,
it would just be written out in vitro.

3250
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:26,910
No,
it's not saying that saying high dose

3251
02:24:26,911 --> 02:24:30,120
ivc,
a nontoxic chemotherapeutic agent that

3252
02:24:30,121 --> 02:24:33,720
can be given in conjunction with
conventional cancer treatments based on

3253
02:24:33,721 --> 02:24:37,230
the work of several vitamin c pioneers.
Before Dr. Jordan was able to prove that

3254
02:24:37,231 --> 02:24:39,630
vitamin c was selectively toxic to
cancer cells,

3255
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:44,190
if given intravenously.
This research has recently reproduced

3256
02:24:44,191 --> 02:24:48,360
and published by Dr. Mark Levine at the
national institute of health.

3257
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:52,980
So meaning that it's the bioavailability
is at its highest because it's

3258
02:24:52,981 --> 02:24:56,700
intravenously introduced,
meaning that what he was saying about

3259
02:24:56,701 --> 02:24:59,850
the bioavailability,
bioavailability because of lyposomal

3260
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,790
science,
that would also be a higher absorption

3261
02:25:02,791 --> 02:25:06,840
rate than eating it normally.
So what he's saying is that what this

3262
02:25:06,930 --> 02:25:09,600
article is saying is that there's
benefit to taking high level of vitamin

3263
02:25:09,601 --> 02:25:10,434
c.

3264
02:25:11,330 --> 02:25:13,050
I look,
I don't have that article in front of

3265
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:14,700
me,
but I will tell you in my experience

3266
02:25:14,701 --> 02:25:18,540
that you can find an article making any
point you want to very easily because

3267
02:25:18,550 --> 02:25:21,150
about anything and,
but does having,

3268
02:25:21,180 --> 02:25:24,460
having researched this extensively and
being very familiar

3269
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:25,480
with,
um,

3270
02:25:25,870 --> 02:25:29,680
with science writers and science
journalist in virtually every field,

3271
02:25:29,681 --> 02:25:34,681
I can tell you that the current thinking
is not that vitamin c has any beneficial

3272
02:25:38,171 --> 02:25:41,140
effect on cancer.
So you are no idea what this article is

3273
02:25:41,141 --> 02:25:43,510
that you're looking at.
I think it's complicated,

3274
02:25:43,511 --> 02:25:44,680
man.
You know,

3275
02:25:44,681 --> 02:25:47,530
I think there's a,
there's a lot of work being done that

3276
02:25:47,531 --> 02:25:49,780
shows that there are benefits to taking
in nutrients.

3277
02:25:49,781 --> 02:25:52,140
There's a,
there was a study transfer,

3278
02:25:52,970 --> 02:25:57,550
the different various vitamins
supplementing various vitamins.

3279
02:25:57,880 --> 02:25:58,990
Um,
there was uh,

3280
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:03,370
an interesting one that I'm looking at
right now that we're talking about the,

3281
02:26:03,371 --> 02:26:06,730
um,
the prevention of shit.

3282
02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:09,580
I'll try to find it,
but I didn't see know those,

3283
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:11,010
um,
here's one,

3284
02:26:11,010 --> 02:26:13,450
uh,
infectious illness prevention and this

3285
02:26:13,451 --> 02:26:15,940
is a,
a ncbi website.

3286
02:26:15,941 --> 02:26:18,160
It's a national health institute,
national institute for health,

3287
02:26:18,700 --> 02:26:23,140
mood and stress cognition,
and they've shown that it's actually

3288
02:26:23,141 --> 02:26:27,430
that you could take high level that
vitamin c and different antioxidants and

3289
02:26:27,431 --> 02:26:30,850
multivitamins had been shown to decrease
juvenile delinquency.

3290
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:33,280
Like I said,
you can find an article.

3291
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:34,930
what did you search for it,
by the way?

3292
02:26:34,931 --> 02:26:36,490
What was your search term?
I don't remember.

3293
02:26:36,550 --> 02:26:41,530
Benefits of vitamin c suck dick vitamins
through that all together.

3294
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:42,910
you know,
man,

3295
02:26:42,910 --> 02:26:44,770
I,
I see where you're going with all this

3296
02:26:44,771 --> 02:26:48,020
and I see your point of view.
You're a no nonsense guy and I,

3297
02:26:48,021 --> 02:26:50,410
I agree with you for the most part.
And I think that,

3298
02:26:50,411 --> 02:26:51,420
uh,
you know,

3299
02:26:51,460 --> 02:26:55,840
in the case of Dr. Gordon and his
description was probably rather

3300
02:26:55,841 --> 02:27:00,280
unfortunate that he decided to give that
anecdotal story along with this very

3301
02:27:00,281 --> 02:27:04,330
interesting aspect of researching
nutrition fair assessment.

3302
02:27:04,331 --> 02:27:04,740
I'll,
I'll,

3303
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:05,900
I'll,
I'll agree with that.

3304
02:27:05,901 --> 02:27:08,110
It's not a,
it would never make me angry enough to

3305
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:12,550
shut it off and yell at them and your
descriptions of even what he said and

3306
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:14,050
the event is off,
you know,

3307
02:27:14,051 --> 02:27:17,020
and I think that's from this hard
stance,

3308
02:27:17,021 --> 02:27:18,370
no nonsense approach you have.

3309
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:21,100
And I don't blame you if you look in the
world that we live in,

3310
02:27:21,101 --> 02:27:24,700
it's filled with bullshit and a no
nonsense guy gets fucking tired of

3311
02:27:24,701 --> 02:27:28,780
dealing with bullshit at a,
on a regular basis all day long.

3312
02:27:29,080 --> 02:27:32,400
And I think you're a bit knee jerk and
your reactions,

3313
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:33,290
their fellow.
Okay,

3314
02:27:33,630 --> 02:27:36,320
they,
you're certainly not the only person to

3315
02:27:36,321 --> 02:27:37,870
have said that.
Well,

3316
02:27:37,890 --> 02:27:40,630
you used to believe that big foot five
years ago may lighten up.

3317
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:45,720
Here's the thing with the thing,
the best definition of skepticism is the

3318
02:27:45,971 --> 02:27:49,450
intersection of science education and
consumer protection.

3319
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:52,420
If people are have better science
literacy,

3320
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:57,640
they are less likely to take advantage
of products that are worthless.

3321
02:27:57,670 --> 02:28:00,160
Okay.
That is a way of looking at it that it

3322
02:28:00,161 --> 02:28:02,980
aids in consumer protection.
That is my motivation.

3323
02:28:02,981 --> 02:28:06,730
I believe that information,
it aids in consumer protection,

3324
02:28:06,770 --> 02:28:08,860
all the information,
the eventually.

3325
02:28:09,190 --> 02:28:11,800
Right now we're dealing with this
rudimentary sort of a way of

3326
02:28:12,110 --> 02:28:17,110
assimilating it and distributing it and
I think ultimately all the bullshit that

3327
02:28:17,531 --> 02:28:20,410
we're dealing with in this world will
stop to to be valid.

3328
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:24,310
I think what we're dealing with right
now is like we google things when they.

3329
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:27,740
When we have an answer about something
and then one day we're going to have an

3330
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:32,800
unstoppable like base of knowledge and I
think that it's probably sooner than

3331
02:28:33,921 --> 02:28:37,340
later,
but right now when we do have this,

3332
02:28:37,370 --> 02:28:40,550
these discrepancies and these,
these issues,

3333
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:44,840
any gray area,
anywhere that you're wrong and you take

3334
02:28:44,841 --> 02:28:47,420
this hard stance,
this hard no nonsense stance,

3335
02:28:47,660 --> 02:28:51,980
it actually does more harm than it does
good because if we could show that

3336
02:28:51,981 --> 02:28:55,730
you're wrong than even though it's not,
your message is correct.

3337
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,430
I agree with your message has set it at
the time and he's my friend.

3338
02:28:58,430 --> 02:28:59,810
I wish I could call you out on your
bullshit.

3339
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:02,990
I wished I could because I know him and
he's kind of crazy,

3340
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:08,410
but you saying all those things
diminishes your initial point because

3341
02:29:08,961 --> 02:29:12,560
your initial point was very valid.
He was being irresponsible in saying

3342
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:15,140
that you could take this stuff and not
get drunk.

3343
02:29:15,141 --> 02:29:18,430
It seems ridiculous.
He shouldn't have told that anecdote

3344
02:29:18,431 --> 02:29:20,870
story,
but you shouldn't have insisted that he

3345
02:29:20,871 --> 02:29:24,950
had said a thousand milligrams and that
is 93 percent bioavailability and then

3346
02:29:24,951 --> 02:29:26,810
you're trying to find some way that he's
wrong.

3347
02:29:26,811 --> 02:29:27,441
So you're going,
well,

3348
02:29:27,441 --> 02:29:29,690
why do you need that much?
And he didn't say that.

3349
02:29:29,691 --> 02:29:30,680
Well,
he's trying to sell this stuff.

3350
02:29:30,681 --> 02:29:32,540
He's not selling shit.
He doesn't have a store.

3351
02:29:32,541 --> 02:29:34,190
He's not selling a god damn thing.
Okay,

3352
02:29:34,430 --> 02:29:37,010
we'll agree to disagree on whether he
said that,

3353
02:29:37,150 --> 02:29:37,983
oh,
we played,

3354
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,870
we played it,
we played it back and I heard.

3355
02:29:39,871 --> 02:29:41,320
But then again,
you hear it again,

3356
02:29:41,500 --> 02:29:46,430
his thousand milligrams and you've given
me some great advice as far as a health

3357
02:29:46,431 --> 02:29:48,580
and fitness and exercise and all sorts
of kudos.

3358
02:29:48,610 --> 02:29:49,670
Gouda.
Had a couple of minutes.

3359
02:29:50,570 --> 02:29:52,200
The whole thing.
Every conversation though.

3360
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:54,510
I know I forgot something.
I know it's good ahead.

3361
02:29:54,520 --> 02:29:57,600
Tell them about him and shit helps your
liver after you drank and you this good

3362
02:29:57,630 --> 02:29:58,463
head.
What is this?

3363
02:29:58,760 --> 02:29:59,960
What is it?
Unbelievable.

3364
02:29:59,990 --> 02:30:02,830
Gludethyon no,
but he goes go a little bit of nuance

3365
02:30:02,920 --> 02:30:03,770
specifically

3366
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:09,300
gludethyon and that would.
And the products that we interact with

3367
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:12,760
our,
a delivery technology,

3368
02:30:12,850 --> 02:30:16,660
we're um,
you wrap the vitamins or you wrap the

3369
02:30:16,661 --> 02:30:19,420
supplement in a what's called a
liposome,

3370
02:30:19,421 --> 02:30:24,421
which is like a cell wall.
So from lecithin is from soy and it

3371
02:30:24,551 --> 02:30:26,810
protects whatever it is that you're
ingesting.

3372
02:30:27,150 --> 02:30:29,800
A lot of the things that you take,
like I think I shared with you,

3373
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:32,980
if you take a thousand milligrams of
vitamin c by mouth,

3374
02:30:33,010 --> 02:30:36,400
you only absorb 19 percent.
The rest of it is destroyed by the acid

3375
02:30:36,401 --> 02:30:39,370
that's in the stomach.
But if you wrap it in this protection

3376
02:30:39,371 --> 02:30:43,480
called the lyposomal,
you'll be able to absorb 93 percent.

3377
02:30:43,810 --> 02:30:46,140
So taking something like glutathione,
which

3378
02:30:46,380 --> 02:30:49,230
exactly he didn't say,
you take a thousand milligrams of

3379
02:30:49,231 --> 02:30:51,630
vitamin c.
He said if you do,

3380
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:53,880
you absorb 93 percent.
If you take.

3381
02:30:53,900 --> 02:30:57,030
He's just giving numbers.
I'm saying if you take a thousand

3382
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:58,980
milligrams of vitamin c,
he's not recommending that as a dose.

3383
02:30:59,190 --> 02:31:01,500
He's saying if you do,
your body absorbs 19 percent.

3384
02:31:01,501 --> 02:31:03,780
That's true.
He's saying if you wrap it in a

3385
02:31:03,781 --> 02:31:06,420
lyposomal structure,
your body absorbs 93 percent.

3386
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:09,330
I'm kind of stunned on what you're
saying.

3387
02:31:09,331 --> 02:31:12,630
I got wrong.
I said he said a thousand milligrams of

3388
02:31:12,631 --> 02:31:17,631
vitamin c and you'll absorb 93 percent
of what you said wrong in was he's

3389
02:31:17,701 --> 02:31:20,850
telling you to take a thousand.
He wasn't telling you to take anything.

3390
02:31:21,870 --> 02:31:25,800
What he's saying is if you take a
thousand milligrams of vitamin c,

3391
02:31:25,801 --> 02:31:30,450
your body will only absorb 19 percent.
If you wrap it in this lyposomal

3392
02:31:30,451 --> 02:31:32,550
structure,
your body will absorb 93 percent.

3393
02:31:32,551 --> 02:31:35,430
I know he's not recommending that as a
daily allowance.

3394
02:31:35,431 --> 02:31:38,430
He's not telling you to take it.
You're trying to find a way to be right

3395
02:31:38,431 --> 02:31:39,264
here.

3396
02:31:39,740 --> 02:31:42,500
I think I'm repeating exactly what you
just said.

3397
02:31:42,501 --> 02:31:45,680
I'm just kind of stunned at that.
You're pointing out what I said was

3398
02:31:45,681 --> 02:31:46,760
wrong.
I said,

3399
02:31:49,190 --> 02:31:50,023
I mean this,
this is.

3400
02:31:50,050 --> 02:31:53,570
This is kind of deteriorating and it's
not entertainment quality here.

3401
02:31:53,571 --> 02:31:54,404
No,
no.

3402
02:31:54,670 --> 02:31:58,600
Explaining where you air in the way you
cast judgment and that you're.

3403
02:31:58,610 --> 02:32:00,640
You're incorrect about what he was
saying,

3404
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:03,880
but you were your main point.
Where he's wrong is why do you need that

3405
02:32:03,881 --> 02:32:05,560
much vitamin c in the first place?
What's the big deal,

3406
02:32:05,561 --> 02:32:07,770
but this lyposomal thing,
you were trying to diminish him.

3407
02:32:07,780 --> 02:32:09,610
You're trying to find ways to diminish
his point,

3408
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:11,460
but he's correct.
All he gave me,

3409
02:32:11,461 --> 02:32:14,650
he gave you a number.
If he didn't give you a number of a

3410
02:32:14,650 --> 02:32:16,090
thousand milligrams would have.
He said 100 milligrams.

3411
02:32:16,091 --> 02:32:17,230
What have you said?
Five hundred milligrams.

3412
02:32:17,231 --> 02:32:20,560
this point was your body.
He came up with a number for a point of

3413
02:32:20,561 --> 02:32:22,000
reference,
but his point was,

3414
02:32:22,001 --> 02:32:26,090
your body only absorbs 19 percent.
He said then if yoU take it lyposomal,

3415
02:32:26,120 --> 02:32:30,880
your body absorbs 93 percent.
He didn't mean that you have to take a

3416
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:33,070
thousand milligrams.
He doesn't tell you to take a thousand

3417
02:32:33,070 --> 02:32:35,500
milligrams.
He just gave you a point of reference

3418
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:40,390
for explaining the bioavailability of
lipos somo products as opposed to the

3419
02:32:40,391 --> 02:32:41,340
standard form of

3420
02:32:41,580 --> 02:32:42,290
desk.
Justin,

3421
02:32:42,290 --> 02:32:47,290
can I just summarize my position and we
can move on just in two points.

3422
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:52,580
Point number one is he used very quack
like language throughout the nine

3423
02:32:52,581 --> 02:32:54,470
minutes that I listened to saying it's
amazing,

3424
02:32:54,471 --> 02:32:55,520
and I became.
Yeah,

3425
02:32:55,580 --> 02:32:56,540
sweetie.
Yes.

3426
02:32:56,670 --> 02:32:59,960
Say which?
Which made me very skeptical of his

3427
02:33:00,290 --> 02:33:02,540
motivations and of the quality of his
information.

3428
02:33:03,350 --> 02:33:05,180
Um,
number two,

3429
02:33:06,830 --> 02:33:09,740
you do not need to take a thousand
milligrams of vitamin c.

3430
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:13,430
He didn't say you do this.
This is not a strong man.

3431
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:15,410
This is right.
This is summarizing my point.

3432
02:33:15,500 --> 02:33:17,000
My point right now,
his point,

3433
02:33:17,001 --> 02:33:22,001
my point is that you do not need to take
doses of any doses of vitamins or other

3434
02:33:22,581 --> 02:33:25,580
supplements unless you're one of the
rare people who for some reason it has a

3435
02:33:25,581 --> 02:33:26,900
vitamin deficiency,
which is,

3436
02:33:27,540 --> 02:33:29,720
you know,
you need to be pretty sick or have some

3437
02:33:29,721 --> 02:33:32,720
problem to have any need for any that
you were criticizing him for saying that

3438
02:33:32,721 --> 02:33:34,850
you need a thousand milligrams,
which is in fact not what he said.

3439
02:33:34,940 --> 02:33:35,773
I don't.
I.

3440
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:38,090
Okay.
I don't think he would have said that

3441
02:33:38,091 --> 02:33:42,230
unless he was trying to imply or suggest
that he's going to take vitamin c.

3442
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:44,330
I'm sure he thinks it's a good thing to
take.

3443
02:33:44,331 --> 02:33:46,520
Vitamin c is a matter of fact.
That's the reason why people don't get

3444
02:33:46,521 --> 02:33:47,180
scurvy.
Right?

3445
02:33:47,180 --> 02:33:49,520
Take vitamin c is good for you.
It keeps that from happening.

3446
02:33:49,521 --> 02:33:52,040
If you go on a long boat trip with a
bunch of assholes who were eating dried

3447
02:33:52,041 --> 02:33:53,450
meat,
take your vitamins.

3448
02:33:53,451 --> 02:33:54,111
Say,
look,

3449
02:33:54,111 --> 02:33:57,440
there's nothing wrong with vitamin c,
but what he's saying is he gave a point

3450
02:33:57,441 --> 02:33:59,420
of reference.
He started with a thousand milligrams.

3451
02:33:59,421 --> 02:34:00,770
If you take that,
he.

3452
02:34:00,771 --> 02:34:03,880
It's a figure of speech.
You will absorb 19 percent if you take

3453
02:34:03,881 --> 02:34:04,671
it liable.
So emily,

3454
02:34:04,671 --> 02:34:06,560
you absorb 93 percent.
We're beating a dead horse.

3455
02:34:06,680 --> 02:34:07,513
You're wrong.
Here

3456
02:34:08,900 --> 02:34:12,190
I,
I am flabbergasted that you're saying

3457
02:34:12,191 --> 02:34:14,170
I'm wrong,
but let's just move on.

3458
02:34:14,171 --> 02:34:15,550
I mean this is just going around in
circles.

3459
02:34:15,551 --> 02:34:17,400
This is silly,
but it's,

3460
02:34:17,460 --> 02:34:18,190
it's,
it's,

3461
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:22,000
it's highlighting the way you think and
the way one of the things about the way

3462
02:34:22,001 --> 02:34:26,620
you think is this desire to be right and
you have a very strong desire to win.

3463
02:34:26,621 --> 02:34:30,070
You're criticizing him to be right and I
think you're wrong and I think you're

3464
02:34:30,071 --> 02:34:32,710
wrong about a couple of things.
You're wrong about your initial

3465
02:34:32,711 --> 02:34:36,370
description of the way he described
things as wrong and you don't like the

3466
02:34:36,371 --> 02:34:40,030
way he used adjectives or hyperbole and
you said that's what I'm talking about.

3467
02:34:40,120 --> 02:34:41,540
Okay,
that's not exactly what you're talking

3468
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:46,640
type of language was what was what I was
real good point is that he said that you

3469
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:50,500
could not get drunk or that his friend
wasn't drunk,

3470
02:34:50,501 --> 02:34:53,350
but that's a really good point.
That sounds like nonsense to me still

3471
02:34:53,351 --> 02:34:55,300
sounds like nonsense.
I think that's a,

3472
02:34:55,450 --> 02:34:58,900
I think he exaggerated or I think he
told an anecdotal story of someone who's

3473
02:34:58,901 --> 02:34:59,734
bullshitting him.

3474
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:02,290
Unfortunately,
those nights where you drink and drink

3475
02:35:02,291 --> 02:35:06,750
and drink and you just can't get drunk,
you've had this experience fucked up.

3476
02:35:07,030 --> 02:35:07,841
What I'm saying is,
man,

3477
02:35:07,841 --> 02:35:09,940
you're a hard line dude.
You don't smoke any weed at all.

3478
02:35:09,941 --> 02:35:11,380
Do you know?
There you go.

3479
02:35:11,770 --> 02:35:14,680
That's what you need.
You need a little cooky and a massage.

3480
02:35:14,890 --> 02:35:17,680
Here we get a thai massage.
Pull your arms back to walk in your

3481
02:35:17,681 --> 02:35:19,120
back.
Relax,

3482
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:19,840
man.
You.

3483
02:35:19,840 --> 02:35:20,673
There's,
there's,

3484
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:24,160
there's,
there's a lot of merit in what you're

3485
02:35:24,161 --> 02:35:26,050
doing and there's a lot of merit and
what you're saying.

3486
02:35:27,140 --> 02:35:30,700
I understand your arguments for this
hard stance.

3487
02:35:30,701 --> 02:35:33,570
I totally understand it,
but I also think that sometimes

3488
02:35:33,590 --> 02:35:37,060
diminishes your actual point,
which can many times be very valid.

3489
02:35:38,470 --> 02:35:39,310
Such as,
well,

3490
02:35:39,311 --> 02:35:40,270
this,
this whole shit.

3491
02:35:40,271 --> 02:35:44,140
We're doing this dance about vitamin c.
Why do you think he brought it up?

3492
02:35:44,141 --> 02:35:44,650
Why do you think?

3493
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:46,510
You talked about wanting to talk about
glutathione.

3494
02:35:46,690 --> 02:35:49,060
He wanted to talk about,
if you listen to the whole podcast,

3495
02:35:49,061 --> 02:35:52,990
he talks about a variety of different
ways that we can improve our health and

3496
02:35:52,991 --> 02:35:55,720
things to avoid,
especially head impacts and he,

3497
02:35:55,721 --> 02:35:56,770
you know,
it goes into depth.

3498
02:35:57,130 --> 02:36:02,130
He's a very,
he's a very interesting and very

3499
02:36:02,231 --> 02:36:04,360
charitable guy.
You're not a bad guy at all.

3500
02:36:04,450 --> 02:36:09,450
So I was confused as to I could see how
you would get upset that statement,

3501
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:12,370
absolutely.
But All that other stuff leading up to

3502
02:36:12,371 --> 02:36:15,370
the statement that sort of flavor the
statement and make it even worse and

3503
02:36:15,371 --> 02:36:16,930
grander turned out to not be true

3504
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:21,090
anytime.
Anytime you're suggesting selling,

3505
02:36:21,091 --> 02:36:26,091
promoting miraculously easy solutions to
complicated problems that should raise a

3506
02:36:26,581 --> 02:36:30,690
huge red flag.
And all of the language he was using

3507
02:36:30,691 --> 02:36:35,691
suggested a miraculously easy solution.
Words like the words he was using,

3508
02:36:35,970 --> 02:36:37,860
the uh,
being.

3509
02:36:37,861 --> 02:36:39,390
Um,
I think he actually,

3510
02:36:39,391 --> 02:36:42,270
in his defense,
he used a lot of those words just to

3511
02:36:42,271 --> 02:36:46,740
describe it's a fax as an antioxidant,
which is pretty much universally

3512
02:36:46,741 --> 02:36:48,230
accepted online.
Um,

3513
02:36:48,570 --> 02:36:51,660
well.
But what effects is an antioxidant?

3514
02:36:51,690 --> 02:36:53,310
It's a strong antioxidant.
what has,

3515
02:36:53,311 --> 02:36:57,390
what has been what the current state of
antIoxidant research is that

3516
02:36:57,391 --> 02:37:00,750
supplementation has no benefit.
The antioxidants that you get from your

3517
02:37:00,751 --> 02:37:03,390
normal diet are more than enough that
your body can,

3518
02:37:03,391 --> 02:37:06,750
will need to use supplementation,
has no benefit.

3519
02:37:06,830 --> 02:37:09,250
Oh,
how did they can lighten me?

3520
02:37:09,490 --> 02:37:13,870
How do they test to see the benefit of
antioxidants and antioxidants?

3521
02:37:13,871 --> 02:37:14,550
A couple minutes.

3522
02:37:14,550 --> 02:37:15,640
This goes to the whole

3523
02:37:16,340 --> 02:37:18,950
question of oxidation versus
antioxidant.

3524
02:37:19,040 --> 02:37:20,780
Sounds like it's a really simple
question.

3525
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:25,810
Good versus bad.
Oxidation is part of so many different

3526
02:37:25,971 --> 02:37:29,990
parts of your metabolism.
Converting the energy and sell to

3527
02:37:30,590 --> 02:37:32,990
converting your chemical energy and sell
to Connecticut injured.

3528
02:37:33,070 --> 02:37:34,430
That's.
That's oxidation.

3529
02:37:34,990 --> 02:37:39,260
You can't just simply say antioxidants,
good oxidation,

3530
02:37:39,261 --> 02:37:40,880
bad.
It's not as simple as that.

3531
02:37:40,910 --> 02:37:42,980
Okay,
but no one's saying what you're saying

3532
02:37:42,981 --> 02:37:46,580
is that what you're saying is
antioxidants have no benefit.

3533
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:49,760
If you take them as a supplement,
supplementation of antioxidants has been

3534
02:37:49,761 --> 02:37:52,190
found to have no benefit.
Where is that?

3535
02:37:52,550 --> 02:37:53,600
Is that published somewhere?

3536
02:37:55,820 --> 02:37:59,270
If you google that sentence,
I'm sure you'll find it supplementation

3537
02:37:59,271 --> 02:38:01,970
of antioxidants,
but how do they know the difference

3538
02:38:01,971 --> 02:38:05,030
between taking it with the.
The benefits of taking it with food and

3539
02:38:05,031 --> 02:38:06,890
the benefits of taking it as a
supplement.

3540
02:38:07,130 --> 02:38:09,020
Well,
because we can chemically measure what's

3541
02:38:09,021 --> 02:38:11,090
in the food,
we can chemically measure what's in a

3542
02:38:11,091 --> 02:38:14,210
supplement.
We know how much your body uses and

3543
02:38:16,580 --> 02:38:19,880
the number of tests that have been done
are all going to use different

3544
02:38:19,881 --> 02:38:22,520
methodologies and I'm sorry I did not
memorize.

3545
02:38:23,210 --> 02:38:24,530
I'm honestly,
I can't tell you.

3546
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:27,650
I'm honestly curious.
What I do as a science writer is

3547
02:38:27,651 --> 02:38:31,570
summarize the available research,
so what?

3548
02:38:31,610 --> 02:38:36,020
This is what I'm confused about you.
if you are taking it in food,

3549
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:39,410
there's a benefit from it.
The amount of oxidation that you get

3550
02:38:39,411 --> 02:38:40,670
into normal diet.
Yes.

3551
02:38:40,910 --> 02:38:45,910
If you don't eat a normal diet,
then I presume that if you were going on

3552
02:38:46,521 --> 02:38:49,910
a starvation diet or something,
then I suppose you'd probably want to

3553
02:38:49,911 --> 02:38:50,870
take a multivitamin.

3554
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:53,820
You at least get your vitamins.
You wouldn't be getting anything else

3555
02:38:53,821 --> 02:38:55,610
that you'd need,
but you'd be getting vitamins.

3556
02:38:56,420 --> 02:39:00,440
I suppose the same is true of just about
any supplement if you're going to starve

3557
02:39:00,441 --> 02:39:01,340
yourself,
but the best,

3558
02:39:01,430 --> 02:39:06,430
the best advice of all is to simply eat
a normal healthy diet because those

3559
02:39:06,681 --> 02:39:07,590
things,
those,

3560
02:39:07,630 --> 02:39:11,480
those aspects of nutrition or available
in that normal healthy diet and their

3561
02:39:11,481 --> 02:39:13,040
bio available,
there's,

3562
02:39:13,220 --> 02:39:16,130
you know,
there's six basic things that you get in

3563
02:39:16,131 --> 02:39:18,620
food.
Number one is water.

3564
02:39:18,860 --> 02:39:23,860
Number two is amino acids.
A number three is carbohydrates,

3565
02:39:24,290 --> 02:39:25,370
sugar,
um,

3566
02:39:25,690 --> 02:39:29,750
number four is fats and five.
Number six,

3567
02:39:29,751 --> 02:39:30,810
what am I missing here?
Oh,

3568
02:39:30,811 --> 02:39:33,530
fives,
vitamins and minerals.

3569
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:37,340
So these are all the different classes
of things that you need and any normal

3570
02:39:37,341 --> 02:39:40,790
healthy diet has all of those that your
body is going to use because actually

3571
02:39:40,791 --> 02:39:43,850
you need quite tiny amounts of all of
those things.

3572
02:39:43,851 --> 02:39:45,800
Your body actually uses very tiny
amounts.

3573
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:48,830
Any normal diet,
the reason you poop and pee is because

3574
02:39:48,831 --> 02:39:53,450
you ate more than you needed.
Supplementation is trying to pour water

3575
02:39:53,451 --> 02:39:55,640
on a bucket that's already overflowing.
Wait a minute,

3576
02:39:55,641 --> 02:39:56,300
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

3577
02:39:56,300 --> 02:39:58,250
The reason you poop ps,
not because he ate,

3578
02:39:58,640 --> 02:40:01,820
drank more than you needed,
you're going to poop and pee if you just

3579
02:40:01,821 --> 02:40:04,490
drink the exact right amount too.
You can poop and pee all the way to

3580
02:40:04,491 --> 02:40:05,324
starvation.

3581
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:07,730
No,
you can't.

3582
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:12,110
You'll stop pooping if you stop eating.
If you keep drinking water when the

3583
02:40:12,111 --> 02:40:15,000
water passes through your body,
it's not because you drank too much

3584
02:40:15,001 --> 02:40:19,080
water.
You drink.

3585
02:40:19,110 --> 02:40:21,380
If you drink a glass of water,
okay,

3586
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:25,290
and that water goes through is exactly
what your body needed in a few hours,

3587
02:40:25,291 --> 02:40:27,240
you're gonna need it as a waste
eliminator.

3588
02:40:27,270 --> 02:40:30,960
Your kidneys are going to continue
producing urine until there is till you

3589
02:40:30,961 --> 02:40:34,350
dehydrate until you're dehydrated,
but there's not a balancing act where

3590
02:40:34,351 --> 02:40:38,130
you can hit the certain sweet spot where
you eat exactly what you need or drink

3591
02:40:38,131 --> 02:40:39,420
exactly what you need.
Look,

3592
02:40:39,490 --> 02:40:41,400
I'm not talking about finding a sweet
spot.

3593
02:40:41,401 --> 02:40:44,430
What I'm saying,
pooping and peeing is because you ate

3594
02:40:44,431 --> 02:40:45,450
too much,
drank too much.

3595
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:48,030
That's not true.
You're taking my words to literally.

3596
02:40:48,031 --> 02:40:49,650
I will.
That's a very literal statement,

3597
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:51,113
isn't it?

3598
02:40:53,130 --> 02:40:53,611
I mean,
come on.

3599
02:40:53,611 --> 02:40:54,900
That's ridiculous.
Medical statement.

3600
02:40:54,901 --> 02:40:58,560
A doctor would listen to that
medical statement.

3601
02:40:58,770 --> 02:41:03,150
What are you saying that what I'm saying
is supplementation of any of these

3602
02:41:03,151 --> 02:41:06,300
things is pouring water on a bucket
that's already over full.

3603
02:41:06,660 --> 02:41:10,080
You don't need more sugar than your body
is going to use.

3604
02:41:10,140 --> 02:41:12,930
You don't need more minerals than your
body is going to use.

3605
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:16,230
You don't need more vitamins than your
body's going to use.

3606
02:41:17,070 --> 02:41:20,280
Anything that you eat of those that is
more than you're gonna use is going to

3607
02:41:20,290 --> 02:41:22,140
be treated from your body somehow or
other,

3608
02:41:22,141 --> 02:41:24,810
sooner or later.
That makes sense.

3609
02:41:24,900 --> 02:41:26,280
That's what I'm saying.
Okay.

3610
02:41:27,350 --> 02:41:28,183
I'm,
uh,

3611
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:30,360
I would,
I would love to know what studies they

3612
02:41:30,361 --> 02:41:34,140
did on antioxidants and what they know,
the benefits of.

3613
02:41:34,141 --> 02:41:35,340
I mean,
they absolutely have measured the

3614
02:41:35,341 --> 02:41:38,080
benefits of it from food,
the individual nutrients and

3615
02:41:38,081 --> 02:41:40,350
antioxidants and what sort of effect
they have on the human body.

3616
02:41:40,490 --> 02:41:43,620
Um,
and what I'd really be curious to find

3617
02:41:43,621 --> 02:41:45,870
out what studies disproved that or prove
that.

3618
02:41:45,871 --> 02:41:46,620
Okay.
Here,

3619
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:48,810
if you're on google right now,
google scup,

3620
02:41:48,820 --> 02:41:51,810
toyed antioxidant.
Not going to read your stuff.

3621
02:41:51,811 --> 02:41:52,960
Silly.
I'm going to,

3622
02:41:52,970 --> 02:41:55,440
if I'm going to google stuff,
I'm going to google people that disagree

3623
02:41:55,441 --> 02:41:57,390
with you,
but if there's a lot of people that do

3624
02:41:57,391 --> 02:41:58,950
agree with you,
in all fairness online,

3625
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:00,300
if if you.
If you.

3626
02:42:00,301 --> 02:42:03,090
If you want to find out if you want to
ask what my sources were,

3627
02:42:03,091 --> 02:42:04,980
where I got the information,
and that's where you'll find it,

3628
02:42:05,190 --> 02:42:06,780
the references at the bottom of the
episode.

3629
02:42:06,990 --> 02:42:09,900
I just wonder what the motivation of
these studies were,

3630
02:42:09,901 --> 02:42:11,460
what,
what the protocol was,

3631
02:42:11,461 --> 02:42:14,910
and there's a lot of variables like this
new study that came out that said case

3632
02:42:14,911 --> 02:42:18,090
closed multivitamin.
Researchers came out and said that

3633
02:42:18,091 --> 02:42:21,090
multivitamins don't work well if you
know what the study was,

3634
02:42:21,091 --> 02:42:22,820
that they actually studied the,
the,

3635
02:42:23,050 --> 02:42:26,310
the protocol that they used and what
they actually tried to do.

3636
02:42:26,320 --> 02:42:30,930
It's kind of irresponsible statement to
say vitamins don't work.

3637
02:42:30,931 --> 02:42:33,510
case closed.
What they did was they gave

3638
02:42:33,630 --> 02:42:38,630
multivitamins these hard multivitamins
to physicians over age 65 and they

3639
02:42:38,881 --> 02:42:41,580
showed no improvement in cognitive
decline,

3640
02:42:41,820 --> 02:42:43,530
so they took people that were already
declining.

3641
02:42:43,710 --> 02:42:47,400
They gave him vitamins that were these
hard fucking synthetic vitamins and they

3642
02:42:47,401 --> 02:42:49,950
showed no,
no decline,

3643
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:52,860
no,
no ceasing in the climbing of their

3644
02:42:52,861 --> 02:42:54,570
cognitive function.
another one,

3645
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:58,560
high dose multivitamins had no effect on
the progression of heart disease and

3646
02:42:58,561 --> 02:43:01,220
heart attack survivors.
So these people are already fucked.

3647
02:43:01,221 --> 02:43:03,990
they already had a heart attack.
They give them high levels of these.

3648
02:43:03,991 --> 02:43:06,210
Again,
synthetic multivitamins,

3649
02:43:06,211 --> 02:43:08,110
these compressed pill form,
you know,

3650
02:43:08,310 --> 02:43:10,920
centrum one a day,
jammies that nobody digests,

3651
02:43:11,170 --> 02:43:13,450
and then another one,
the third study,

3652
02:43:13,451 --> 02:43:17,290
which actually is fairly positive
concludes that limited evidence supports

3653
02:43:17,291 --> 02:43:20,830
any benefit from vitamin and mineral
supplementation for the prevention of

3654
02:43:20,831 --> 02:43:22,690
cancer or cardiovascular disease.

3655
02:43:22,810 --> 02:43:26,850
two trials found a small borderline
significant benefit from multivitamins,

3656
02:43:26,851 --> 02:43:31,851
supplements on cancer in men only and no
effect on cardiovascular disease.

3657
02:43:32,291 --> 02:43:36,070
So that's a small barely measurable
effect from these shitty synthetic

3658
02:43:36,071 --> 02:43:40,270
vitamins on people who are fuCked.
People who are already sick,

3659
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:42,430
people,
their bodies are already dying.

3660
02:43:42,560 --> 02:43:47,520
Like to say that vitamins don't work
based on those three components is a

3661
02:43:47,521 --> 02:43:48,550
ridiculous.
Well,

3662
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:52,150
you know,
a really unfortunate aspect of the world

3663
02:43:52,151 --> 02:43:55,630
of science reporting.
Something that I've come to learn over

3664
02:43:55,631 --> 02:43:57,120
and over and over again,
and it's,

3665
02:43:57,140 --> 02:44:02,140
it's pretty depressing is how news makes
it from the lab into,

3666
02:44:03,030 --> 02:44:06,370
onto people's computers or gotcha aspect
of the title,

3667
02:44:06,371 --> 02:44:07,204
right?
Yeah.

3668
02:44:07,920 --> 02:44:11,530
The fact is that universities were so
much research has done,

3669
02:44:11,860 --> 02:44:16,860
they have pr departments and they are
responsible for keeping attention on

3670
02:44:17,351 --> 02:44:18,610
this university,
keeping,

3671
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:22,960
keeping the money flowing,
and the pr department at a university is

3672
02:44:22,961 --> 02:44:27,760
going to spin what they see as the most
reportable aspect of the research being

3673
02:44:27,761 --> 02:44:28,360
done.

3674
02:44:28,360 --> 02:44:32,230
They send out the press release and then
the press does exactly the same thing.

3675
02:44:32,470 --> 02:44:35,710
They look at it and look for the most
reportable aspect of this and it's

3676
02:44:35,711 --> 02:44:36,800
often,
um,

3677
02:44:37,450 --> 02:44:41,380
often it's completely wrong by the time
it gets to the presses because they'll

3678
02:44:41,381 --> 02:44:45,520
report the sensational aspect of it.
And what you'll often see,

3679
02:44:46,480 --> 02:44:48,790
I follow a lot of science writers who do
this a lot,

3680
02:44:49,120 --> 02:44:52,180
is they,
they kind of reverse engineer these

3681
02:44:52,181 --> 02:44:55,150
headlines that have become so prominent.
And it's always.

3682
02:44:55,151 --> 02:44:57,640
Some scientists find that this will kill
you.

3683
02:44:57,670 --> 02:44:59,860
Scientists find that this is a miracle
cure.

3684
02:45:00,130 --> 02:45:03,100
And when you reverse engineer those
headlines and go back and look at the

3685
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:06,550
original research that was done,
you'll find often it said exactly the

3686
02:45:06,551 --> 02:45:10,690
opposite of what the headline says.
It's really difficult to come up with,

3687
02:45:11,160 --> 02:45:14,170
um,
kind of a journeyman's interpretation of

3688
02:45:14,171 --> 02:45:16,540
sCience news by reading,
by reading mass media.

3689
02:45:17,250 --> 02:45:19,570
Yeah.
They did publish the study though.

3690
02:45:19,690 --> 02:45:22,090
The title of this study is enough,
is enough,

3691
02:45:22,091 --> 02:45:25,210
stop wasting money on vitamin and
mineral supplements.

3692
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:27,910
And this is the title of the article
that was released.

3693
02:45:27,911 --> 02:45:32,490
I think they took an inflammatory
position that I don't think it's

3694
02:45:32,491 --> 02:45:35,050
supported by the evidence and the
research that they presented.

3695
02:45:35,080 --> 02:45:37,030
And it's very short sighted.
There's many,

3696
02:45:37,031 --> 02:45:41,410
many aspects to a to health.
And when you're dealing with someone who

3697
02:45:41,411 --> 02:45:45,640
is already really fucking sick,
which is all three of the people that

3698
02:45:45,641 --> 02:45:48,810
they described that they tested these
things on all groups of people,

3699
02:45:49,120 --> 02:45:49,541
you know,
you're,

3700
02:45:49,541 --> 02:45:54,541
you're dealing with a mean to try to
like the rate of decline in people that

3701
02:45:55,121 --> 02:45:58,540
have alzheimer's and the rate of decline
of people with cognitive decline.

3702
02:45:59,220 --> 02:46:00,760
We don'T have anything that's going to
stop that.

3703
02:46:00,790 --> 02:46:02,790
Like what makes you thiNk the vitamins
are going to stop it because the

3704
02:46:02,791 --> 02:46:06,070
vitamins don't stop it.
Be things that would be benefIcial for

3705
02:46:06,071 --> 02:46:10,070
health are not stopping something that
we've never been able to stop.

3706
02:46:10,250 --> 02:46:15,230
That seems preposterous to say vitamins
don't work based on that evidence.

3707
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:19,760
It seems to me like this is something
that was a predetermined conclusion or

3708
02:46:19,761 --> 02:46:22,670
the most inflammatory response,
wHich we're talking about it.

3709
02:46:22,671 --> 02:46:24,500
So it's effective in that sense.
Sure.

3710
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:26,420
Yeah.
So 10 minutes.

3711
02:46:26,660 --> 02:46:28,400
We're almost out.
We turn into a pumpkin at three hours

3712
02:46:28,401 --> 02:46:29,120
in,

3713
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:29,953
um,
well,

3714
02:46:30,920 --> 02:46:34,240
there,
there is a really unfortunate word and

3715
02:46:34,241 --> 02:46:39,241
it's consensus and the word consensus.
I describe it as unfortunate because it

3716
02:46:39,641 --> 02:46:44,641
has a very different meaning in popular
usage than it has in scientific fields.

3717
02:46:45,400 --> 02:46:50,400
In scientific fields.
we describe a consensus as something not

3718
02:46:50,591 --> 02:46:52,660
merely that most scientists generally
agree on,

3719
02:46:52,661 --> 02:46:56,650
although that's often true.
What scientific consensus really means

3720
02:46:56,680 --> 02:47:01,540
is that this is research that has been
repeated in other labs and the results

3721
02:47:01,541 --> 02:47:04,600
have been confirmed.
The results have been scrutinized.

3722
02:47:04,840 --> 02:47:07,540
People have tried to disprove them.
People tried to find alternate

3723
02:47:07,541 --> 02:47:11,440
explanations and it has truly past a
certain level of scientific rigor.

3724
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:15,250
Then we say we have a scIentific
consensus in science circles.

3725
02:47:15,280 --> 02:47:20,050
Consensus means a lot more than it does
in popular usage and you will find that

3726
02:47:20,051 --> 02:47:25,051
the consensus is that supplementation
has no benefit among healthy people who

3727
02:47:26,171 --> 02:47:30,010
don't have a deficiency due to some
strange cars,

3728
02:47:30,011 --> 02:47:33,860
whatever that might be.
I think you will always find articles to

3729
02:47:33,910 --> 02:47:38,910
the contrary or articles like this that
sensationalize that into something that

3730
02:47:39,071 --> 02:47:39,610
it's not

3731
02:47:39,610 --> 02:47:41,650
sensationalize the the negative aspects
of it.

3732
02:47:41,830 --> 02:47:46,830
I don't think there's really a consensus
about a supplementation because in order

3733
02:47:46,931 --> 02:47:50,830
to really totally,
completely monitor like the variations

3734
02:47:50,831 --> 02:47:53,110
between two human beings,
you'd have to have two people that were

3735
02:47:53,111 --> 02:47:56,470
exactly the same genetically exactly the
same as far as their life experiences,

3736
02:47:56,471 --> 02:47:59,860
their life stress,
all the different factors that add up to

3737
02:47:59,861 --> 02:48:03,550
health.
There is a massive range of factors that

3738
02:48:03,551 --> 02:48:05,470
come into play when you're dealing with
a person's health.

3739
02:48:05,890 --> 02:48:09,070
If you measure a bunch of people with
very good diets,

3740
02:48:09,071 --> 02:48:12,730
rich in green leafy vegetables and live
foods and all these different healthy

3741
02:48:12,731 --> 02:48:15,850
things and no bullshit and processed
foods,

3742
02:48:16,120 --> 02:48:20,200
and then you measure people who have the
typical american fast food dine,

3743
02:48:20,201 --> 02:48:22,780
I think you're going to see that these
nutrients is certainly beneficial to the

3744
02:48:22,781 --> 02:48:25,780
people that eat healthy food are
certainly going to have a,

3745
02:48:25,940 --> 02:48:28,530
a greater instance of,
uh,

3746
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:33,340
of being healthy but to,
to to really break it down and figure

3747
02:48:33,341 --> 02:48:38,341
out how much of an effect a nutritional
supplement would have based on based on

3748
02:48:39,071 --> 02:48:41,860
that would be like you'd have to take
the exact same people live in the exact

3749
02:48:41,861 --> 02:48:45,000
same lives and one of them would take a
supplement and one of them wouldn't me

3750
02:48:45,030 --> 02:48:47,640
be really hard to figure out and then
you'd have to say,

3751
02:48:47,810 --> 02:48:49,360
well,
if you eat healthy,

3752
02:48:49,361 --> 02:48:50,200
it's the best way.

3753
02:48:50,290 --> 02:48:52,660
Everybody agrees on that.
I don't think I've heard a single person

3754
02:48:52,661 --> 02:48:56,050
who knows about health and nutrition
that says that you could eat shitty food

3755
02:48:56,051 --> 02:48:57,460
and just take vitamins.
It's impossible.

3756
02:48:57,461 --> 02:48:58,840
It doesn't work that way.
You.

3757
02:48:58,930 --> 02:49:02,230
There's certain aspects of food that's
just missing in pill form.

3758
02:49:02,231 --> 02:49:05,440
You're always better off getting fresh
leafy vegetables that are right out of

3759
02:49:05,441 --> 02:49:10,441
the ground,
but taking supplements as well with a

3760
02:49:10,711 --> 02:49:13,290
very diet,
especially if your diet doesn't balance

3761
02:49:13,291 --> 02:49:15,130
out as long as we're aware of the
bioavailability,

3762
02:49:15,390 --> 02:49:18,420
those supplements,
and then we're also aware that your body

3763
02:49:18,421 --> 02:49:21,720
can absorb some of those supplements.
It seems to me like you're hedging your

3764
02:49:21,721 --> 02:49:24,000
bets.
It seems like it's a good idea to take a

3765
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:26,550
good,
strong natural food based.

3766
02:49:26,730 --> 02:49:30,240
I'm a supplementation program.
Uh,

3767
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:32,310
I think generally there's no harm in
them,

3768
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:34,910
no harm and no,
I can say except for the wallet right

3769
02:49:34,990 --> 02:49:36,030
there,
just unnecessary.

3770
02:49:36,030 --> 02:49:38,490
I don't know if they're unnecessary.
If your diet is not totally balanced.

3771
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:41,460
Well makeup,
but I think it maybe they'll make up

3772
02:49:41,461 --> 02:49:44,820
some slack and if it can make up some
slack than I think that is a,

3773
02:49:44,830 --> 02:49:47,820
that the beneficial.
I think if you have a healthy diet,

3774
02:49:47,821 --> 02:49:48,810
you're right,
you don't need it,

3775
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:52,570
but there's a lot of shit that you get
from from vitamin supplementation like

3776
02:49:53,300 --> 02:49:58,020
like there's certain like five htp,
like five htp which produces serotonin.

3777
02:49:58,290 --> 02:50:00,900
If you're,
if you're trying to get that from food,

3778
02:50:01,140 --> 02:50:04,650
you gotta eat like a fucking garbage bag
full of grass,

3779
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:05,440
you know,
you're,

3780
02:50:05,440 --> 02:50:07,980
you're not going to the amount that you
can take in a couple of pills.

3781
02:50:07,981 --> 02:50:09,910
The extracted form of the,
the,

3782
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:12,780
the active nutrients like fuck.
You'd have to eat a lot of stuff to get

3783
02:50:12,781 --> 02:50:16,680
that and I think that that science,
these people have figured out how to

3784
02:50:16,681 --> 02:50:17,580
extract these things.

3785
02:50:17,580 --> 02:50:20,070
They're not just guessing.
They're not just guessing what the

3786
02:50:20,071 --> 02:50:24,430
effects are on the body or guessing how
to get this stuff out of food or what.

3787
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:25,830
What contains it.
They know,

3788
02:50:25,831 --> 02:50:28,920
and that is science as well.
It always amazes me how the human race

3789
02:50:28,921 --> 02:50:32,170
managed to survive until this decade
before all these things were invented.

3790
02:50:32,210 --> 02:50:34,110
We survived,
but that's not the idea.

3791
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:35,130
The idea is,
are we,

3792
02:50:35,190 --> 02:50:37,740
are we optimized?
And manY times,

3793
02:50:37,741 --> 02:50:39,720
no,
many times we're not optimized.

3794
02:50:40,220 --> 02:50:43,080
We're optimized when we add supplements,
sometimes you know,

3795
02:50:43,081 --> 02:50:46,500
sometimes supplements can if you were in
a situation where you're not getting all

3796
02:50:46,501 --> 02:50:50,010
the beneficial nutrients,
but you add them and then try to balance

3797
02:50:50,011 --> 02:50:51,270
out your diet as well.
I think it can.

3798
02:50:51,330 --> 02:50:53,370
It can aid you.
I don't think it's an either or.

3799
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:58,320
I think undeniably healthy food is the
number one thing for for health healthy

3800
02:50:58,321 --> 02:50:58,500
food.

3801
02:50:58,500 --> 02:51:01,680
Your body is what I was talking to these
hunters yesterday and they were talking

3802
02:51:01,681 --> 02:51:04,650
about how bears that eat certain foods
are not good to eat.

3803
02:51:04,980 --> 02:51:07,050
Like if bears eat rotten fish and eat
them,

3804
02:51:07,051 --> 02:51:08,730
like you literally taste the rotten
fish,

3805
02:51:08,940 --> 02:51:12,720
but if bears eat blueberries,
they're delicious and they're there.

3806
02:51:12,770 --> 02:51:16,140
They actually had a hunting episode
about catching a bears,

3807
02:51:16,350 --> 02:51:20,070
blueberry bears that come out of the
dens and just feast on these huge hills

3808
02:51:20,071 --> 02:51:23,400
of blueberries and they get fat with.
With blueberry fat.

3809
02:51:23,401 --> 02:51:25,770
It's amazing because as they're cutting
this fat off,

3810
02:51:25,771 --> 02:51:29,070
it's like a bluish fat,
like the dye from the blueberry actually

3811
02:51:29,071 --> 02:51:31,560
makes it into their cells.
Unbelievable.

3812
02:51:31,561 --> 02:51:36,561
But it stands to reason that we are also
what we eat and if we eat a ton of

3813
02:51:37,021 --> 02:51:40,770
healthy foods that our flesh is enriched
with nutrients are,

3814
02:51:40,940 --> 02:51:45,060
our tissue is enriched with this,
this purified water and these healthy

3815
02:51:45,061 --> 02:51:49,470
vegetables and good lean proteins and
all these different things that are good

3816
02:51:49,471 --> 02:51:50,304
for us.

3817
02:51:50,850 --> 02:51:52,890
If you could take that,
a little bit of that in pill form as

3818
02:51:52,891 --> 02:51:55,140
well.
I don't think it's a bad thing for you.

3819
02:51:55,280 --> 02:51:56,310
Like I say,
I agree.

3820
02:51:56,311 --> 02:51:57,930
It's not a bad thing for you.
It's just,

3821
02:51:57,931 --> 02:52:01,380
it's just almost always unnecessary.
And so if you want to lead a super

3822
02:52:01,381 --> 02:52:03,990
balanced diet,
I think if you have any kind of,

3823
02:52:03,991 --> 02:52:05,950
uh,
any kind of a diet and if you don't live

3824
02:52:05,951 --> 02:52:06,784
in,
you know,

3825
02:52:06,820 --> 02:52:09,380
chat or Somalia,
you're getting your,

3826
02:52:09,390 --> 02:52:12,940
you're doing pretty well.
So you think that it's not worth it.

3827
02:52:12,941 --> 02:52:15,590
Your call is that it's not worth it.
Like the amount of money spent on

3828
02:52:15,591 --> 02:52:18,250
providing men's is pretty expensive.
Huge.

3829
02:52:18,251 --> 02:52:19,510
Yeah.
If tremendous.

3830
02:52:19,520 --> 02:52:21,190
And multivitamins,
if you're going to buy the.

3831
02:52:21,191 --> 02:52:24,360
I buy these packs,
these men pure packs,

3832
02:52:24,361 --> 02:52:27,520
these athlete pure packs because it's
easy for me to do and I think they're

3833
02:52:27,521 --> 02:52:28,630
called,
I forget what it costs.

3834
02:52:29,100 --> 02:52:31,180
It's probably like a dollar,
a pill pack or something like that.

3835
02:52:31,181 --> 02:52:33,100
Maybe maybe a little bit more and over
time.

3836
02:52:33,640 --> 02:52:34,241
yeah,
that could,

3837
02:52:34,241 --> 02:52:35,110
uh,
that could add up.

3838
02:52:35,111 --> 02:52:37,900
But for me,
I think of it as a hedging my bet.

3839
02:52:38,050 --> 02:52:41,020
I want to make sure I get as much
nutrients in my body as I can.

3840
02:52:41,870 --> 02:52:42,580
You know,
there's a lot,

3841
02:52:42,580 --> 02:52:45,130
there's a lot more substantial things to
worry about in life.

3842
02:52:45,160 --> 02:52:48,190
There's also things though that the
average person doesn't need that

3843
02:52:48,191 --> 02:52:50,240
athletes do.
And I think that that's a,

3844
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:52,900
that's another issue when it comes to
supplementation.

3845
02:52:53,140 --> 02:52:55,540
Athletes,
a lot of benefit in food and

3846
02:52:55,541 --> 02:52:58,630
supplementation now can't always have
more fluid depending on what you're in.

3847
02:52:58,631 --> 02:52:59,140
You know,
some,

3848
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:02,830
some athletes have to watch their weight
gotta wash the girlish figure,

3849
02:53:03,410 --> 02:53:06,970
so they just need to make sure they get
some exercise to brian,

3850
02:53:07,510 --> 02:53:09,950
you and I agree on more than we disagree
or not.

3851
02:53:09,960 --> 02:53:10,793
I,
I,

3852
02:53:10,810 --> 02:53:13,510
I'm sorry if I was rough with you about
certain things like defending my friend

3853
02:53:13,511 --> 02:53:14,920
mark,
but if I didn't you would've fucking

3854
02:53:14,921 --> 02:53:18,030
killed me next time I saw him and I
would have to deal with glutosiome and

3855
02:53:18,031 --> 02:53:20,770
talk for an hour and a half.
I just want to review the tweets and how

3856
02:53:20,771 --> 02:53:22,990
many people have called me an asshole
over the.

3857
02:53:23,020 --> 02:53:25,420
Oh,
he can't listen if anybody's calling

3858
02:53:25,570 --> 02:53:27,280
brian and asshole.
He's not an asshole.

3859
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:30,790
And I think that your ideas essentially
the,

3860
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:32,920
the hard stance that you take is
because,

3861
02:53:32,921 --> 02:53:34,780
you know,
there's so much bullshit out there and I

3862
02:53:34,781 --> 02:53:37,060
think it's a good stance.
I think it's the right stance most of

3863
02:53:37,061 --> 02:53:38,440
the time.
And I think that,

3864
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:39,520
you know,
by,

3865
02:53:39,580 --> 02:53:44,110
by being this hard edge,
no nonsense guide though it does

3866
02:53:45,310 --> 02:53:48,400
eliminate some of the flexibility of
this world.

3867
02:53:48,430 --> 02:53:51,100
The,
the real conspiracies are automatically

3868
02:53:51,101 --> 02:53:53,140
dismissed for the standard,
you know,

3869
02:53:54,490 --> 02:53:55,330
official report.

3870
02:53:55,720 --> 02:53:58,060
No,
I think that's not always good either,

3871
02:53:58,390 --> 02:53:58,991
you know?
Yeah.

3872
02:53:58,991 --> 02:54:03,280
I mean the old saying extraordinary
claims need extraordinary evidence.

3873
02:54:03,430 --> 02:54:05,200
Sure.
If you go around and questioning,

3874
02:54:05,201 --> 02:54:07,750
you know whether this table is real or
whether it's an illusion,

3875
02:54:07,751 --> 02:54:10,630
obviously that's silly,
but you got to draw the line somewhere.

3876
02:54:10,750 --> 02:54:11,990
I don't know.
I had dr mikhal,

3877
02:54:12,050 --> 02:54:15,100
swami theoretical physicist,
and he made me question everything.

3878
02:54:15,640 --> 02:54:20,640
I started talking about string theory
and the fucking particles in the state

3879
02:54:21,011 --> 02:54:24,490
of superposition where they're moving
and still at the same time they appear

3880
02:54:24,491 --> 02:54:26,230
and denny's a swami.
Well,

3881
02:54:26,231 --> 02:54:28,830
his name is dr.
goswami.

3882
02:54:28,870 --> 02:54:29,681
Oh,
I'm sorry.

3883
02:54:29,681 --> 02:54:32,610
I don't get on racist dude.
Happens to be indian.

3884
02:54:32,620 --> 02:54:34,720
They'll come down on you hard son.
There's a billion of them.

3885
02:54:36,070 --> 02:54:39,610
I want to thank you for coming on the
podcast first fall and I want to thank

3886
02:54:39,611 --> 02:54:42,250
you for just discussing all this stuff.

3887
02:54:42,350 --> 02:54:43,183
Maybe it's,
it's.

3888
02:54:43,190 --> 02:54:46,420
It's fascinating and like I said,
I think we agree more than we disagree

3889
02:54:46,421 --> 02:54:50,260
and I'm glad we cleared up.
Hopefully some of the misconceptions

3890
02:54:50,440 --> 02:54:53,920
about how I approach things because I
certainly am easy to criticize and I'm

3891
02:54:53,921 --> 02:54:58,180
certainly easy to categorize as well.
It's a lot of my ridiculous comments,

3892
02:54:58,181 --> 02:55:01,210
aren't we all on various things have
suggested.

3893
02:55:01,300 --> 02:55:03,170
Well,
I will certainly be following this up on

3894
02:55:03,171 --> 02:55:05,120
[inaudible] dot com.
What does that mean?

3895
02:55:05,840 --> 02:55:09,170
The battle continues.
That's sounds like a warning man.

3896
02:55:09,200 --> 02:55:11,300
Battle commodities is a little bit of a
battle.

3897
02:55:12,300 --> 02:55:14,690
Thank you very much and people can find
you on twitter.

3898
02:55:14,990 --> 02:55:19,990
It's brian dunning on twitter.

inflammation.
Tinder.

3905
02:55:32,660 --> 02:55:34,160
What do you want to say before we wrap
this pitch up?

3906
02:55:34,220 --> 02:55:36,920
I'm on facebook,
but it's very unfortunate.

3907
02:55:36,921 --> 02:55:41,710
Page name is tom dunning fan page.
The fan page humiliates the hell out of

3908
02:55:41,711 --> 02:55:43,160
it.
Did you enjoy this conversation or was

3909
02:55:43,161 --> 02:55:44,420
it frustrated?
I had a great time.

3910
02:55:44,421 --> 02:55:45,051
Okay,
good.

3911
02:55:45,051 --> 02:55:46,880
Thank you.
I feel it makes me feel much better.

3912
02:55:47,030 --> 02:55:48,440
I hate when people leave here in the
men.

3913
02:55:49,050 --> 02:55:50,390
Don't want anybody mad.
I think,

3914
02:55:50,391 --> 02:55:51,560
uh,
I would love to do this again.

3915
02:55:51,561 --> 02:55:54,650
We'll talk again and maybe we can
address some of the things that people

3916
02:55:54,651 --> 02:55:57,140
said online and the main things are
going to call you and me.

3917
02:55:58,340 --> 02:55:59,210
We're gonna.
Have some fun.

3918
02:55:59,240 --> 02:56:00,290
All right.
Thank you everybody.

3919
02:56:00,291 --> 02:56:03,710
Thanks for tuning into the podcast.
We'll be back friday with the one and

3921
02:56:05,740 --> 02:56:06,351

3923
02:56:09,141 --> 02:56:11,210
sir.
I can't wait.

3924
02:56:11,211 --> 02:56:12,420
I'm very excited.
Um,

3925
02:56:12,710 --> 02:56:15,420
and uh,
as far as dates to morrow,

3926
02:56:15,820 --> 02:56:18,860
uh,

3927
02:56:18,861 --> 02:56:21,270
I'm going to be in dallas,
