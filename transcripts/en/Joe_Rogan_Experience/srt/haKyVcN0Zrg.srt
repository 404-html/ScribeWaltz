00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,770
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,290
Like one of the things that is driving
me crazy about a lot of this tweeting and

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:07,831
craziness.

4
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:12,831
Like I was in a New York City for the
fights and me and my friend Cam Haines who

5
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,960
went to the gym and young
Jamie was there too.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,880
But you weren't with us
when we were stuck in the,

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,580
in the swarm of humans
with just me and cam.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,290
We've got to the gym no problem.

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,640
But on our way back,

10
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,020
the protest had marched through the
area that we walked through and all of a

11
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,220
sudden we couldn't go anywhere.

12
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:30,840
It was just jammed with people.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,750
So you're literally shoulder
to shoulder with people.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,670
Like just everybody's touching everybody.

15
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:36,001
There's just,

16
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,020
you had to deal with it.

17
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:37,980
There was nothing to do with,

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,530
which is one of the reasons why a
fanny pack is so important folks.

19
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,760
Cause you keep your money in your front.

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:42,241
Okay.

21
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,310
Nobody's pickpocket and
I can think zipped up,

22
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,260
my shirt goes over that I'm
going to know and to get there,

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,360
it's going to take some work
cause pickpockets do go to
those things you need to

24
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,470
be aware of.

25
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,060
You're one of those super lefties.

26
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,610
It likes to go and castrate you Shit Jack.

27
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,270
So while we're walking this one guy
with this perfectly manicured beard,

28
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:02,851
I'll never forget,

29
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:05,400
he had a really nice like wool jacket on.

30
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,120
He was,

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,590
he was obviously like a wealthy liberal
character and he's screaming out.

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,440
I mean screaming in my fucking ear.

33
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,610
He's right here.

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:14,941
He's real.

35
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,840
He's touching me,

36
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:16,641
he's touching me.

37
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:18,620
The shoulders know Donald Trump.

38
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,101
K,

39
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:19,431
k.

40
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:20,810
K.

41
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:20,811
Racist,

42
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:21,644
sexist.

43
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,410
But he wouldn't stop.

44
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:25,430
He wouldn't stop.

45
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,050
And part of me wanting to go,

46
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:27,471
hey man,

47
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:28,304
could you just like,

48
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,990
if you want to go in the protest,

49
00:01:29,991 --> 00:01:31,310
the protest is in the street.

50
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,140
Like you're on the sidewalk.

51
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,610
This isn't the protest.

52
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:34,791
Yeah,

53
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:35,780
this is the salon.

54
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,230
This is some noncommittal
shit you're doing here.

55
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,860
Like if you want to be out in,

56
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:40,760
he'll be all in.

57
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:41,211
But he's like,

58
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:42,380
he's doing drive bys.

59
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,750
He's like a walk by screaming protests.

60
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,370
But does it really do anything?

61
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,690
He saw a black guy and a distance.

62
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,030
I swear to God he starts going shut up.

63
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,120
Black lives matter.

64
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,120
Black lives matter.

65
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,013
Hell No.

66
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:52,963
Oh hell.

67
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,280
He's just trying to get everybody to
join him with my friend Michael Shermer

68
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:59,290
likes to call virtue signaling.

69
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,101
That's what it is.

70
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:03,030
He's peacocking his
virtue and just trying,

71
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,950
just trying to get everybody to jump on.

72
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,890
There was a woman with a sign
that said Rape Millennia,

73
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,563
Cisa,

74
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,350
and apparently that's about
writing that thing out.

75
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,040
Crazy.

76
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,571
Here we go.

77
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,840
It's a Hashtag on Twitter.

78
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,674
Now

79
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,420
look as a,

80
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,020
as a Brit observing what's been
happening in America as an outsider,

81
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:28,470
I'm enormously encouraged by the
legalization of cannabis movement that is,

82
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,160
that is taking place here and and,

83
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,790
and what it and what it all means.

84
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,691
Sure.

85
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:33,650
I liked to smoke a joint,

86
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:35,120
but this is not about getting high.

87
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,200
It's not about recreation.

88
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:40,910
What this is about is recognizing the
sovereignty of adults to make decisions

89
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,110
over their own bodies,

90
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,830
their own health and their
own consciousness while
doing no harm to others.

91
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,760
That's what it's about,

92
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:49,250
and that's a really
fucking important issue.

93
00:02:49,251 --> 00:02:50,150
That is for me,

94
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:53,510
that is the most important issue because
if we live in a society that is not

95
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:57,050
prepared to recognize adults
sovereignty over one's own body,

96
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,220
in one's own consciousness,

97
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,540
then that cannot be a free
society in any meaningful way.

98
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,830
And so I applaud the people of America
in those states who have voted for full

99
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,700
legalization.

100
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,090
That's a brilliant thing to do and
that's going to have an impact around the

101
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:11,470
world because the war on drugs,

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,420
all the ideology and lies about cannabis
are all going to be proved wrong.

103
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,180
We're going to know that the
emperor wears no clothes,

104
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:23,170
that you can legalize
cannabis and civilization does
not fall apart as the war

105
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:25,300
on drugs lobby had been
telling us for ages.

106
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,403
It's going to,

107
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,670
it's going to change everything.

108
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,980
And it's a beautiful thing
because it's the American people.

109
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:34,981
Whereas the American state America as a
governmental state presence on the world

110
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:39,040
stage has been the dark force
behind the war on drugs.

111
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,083
So it's,

112
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,010
it's uh,

113
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,380
for me a beautiful thing that is the
American people's state by state who are

114
00:03:44,381 --> 00:03:45,760
winding that back and saying,

115
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,950
we will not put up with this shit anymore.

116
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,851
I'm not sure.

117
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:50,020
I think we need to under,

118
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,261
I mean,

119
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:54,460
the more we figure out about like
way a language golf in language,

120
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,010
right?

121
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,390
Um,

122
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,021
there's really,

123
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:56,351
Jimmy,

124
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:56,980
if you look,

125
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,300
you might be able to dig it up.

126
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:58,691
There's a,

127
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,480
there's a guy I want to say is that
northern Arizona University who worked on

128
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,860
prairie dog language,

129
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,050
if you have you heard about this,

130
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:05,320
this is crazy research.

131
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,550
So one of the reasons we've never been
able to study animal communication,

132
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,660
and I could screw this up,

133
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,920
but we'll try it,

134
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,560
is we couldn't talk back,

135
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:14,771
right?

136
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,910
We couldn't talk to them.

137
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,140
So what he did is he recorded it,

138
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,280
ton of prairie dog communication and
then started sort of decoding what little

139
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,010
things mean and but use the
computer to play it back to them.

140
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,740
So what he discovered is prairie dogs,

141
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:31,750
which you don't think of it
as particularly intelligent.

142
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,610
When they'd started
decoding their language,

143
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:34,450
they started to realize it.

144
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,060
Prairie dogs were teeny say things like,

145
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:37,930
Hey,

146
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,860
be careful of that right path over there
cause there's a fat guy in a purple

147
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,630
sweater coming this way.

148
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,930
That detailed like in the
beginning of the [inaudible].

149
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:46,121
Yeah.

150
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:50,020
They used to think animals only sort of
communicated in like nouns and verbs.

151
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,210
Present tense nouns and verbs,

152
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,930
right.

153
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,960
Snake of the,

154
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:54,491
you know,

155
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,780
there are some certain calls
that are monkeys two days,

156
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,340
right?

157
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,120
The three calls now they're starting
to realize they've got adjectives,

158
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,470
they've got tenses.

159
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,304
They can think in the,

160
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,680
for a while they thought
animals lived in a perpetual,

161
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,190
pleasant,

162
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,671
present,

163
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,220
right?

164
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,140
Like the argument was all animals
are always in flow bright,

165
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:12,370
which is the every focused,

166
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:14,590
everything in the now it turns
out that's not the case at all.

167
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:15,311
They have passed,

168
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,240
they have futures.

169
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,110
We asked this question a lot running
an animal sanctuary because if we,

170
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,850
if we're caring for a dog,

171
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:23,590
it's not just older special needs.

172
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,660
It's compromise.

173
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,120
Shelter was on death row is probably if
it's ended up with us because we work

174
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,380
with the worst of the worst of the worst.

175
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,400
It's been very,

176
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,570
very badly abused,

177
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:31,891
et Cetera,

178
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:32,201
et cetera.

179
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:36,190
And the question my wife and I always
used to talk about was do they know,

180
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,090
do they like,

181
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,740
do they feel grateful to us?

182
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:39,250
Do they,

183
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,040
can they remember their
past enough to know that,

184
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,700
you know,

185
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,470
the present is different and we were,

186
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:44,801
we were,

187
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,341
what was different?

188
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:46,600
Like those kinds of questions.

189
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,370
And after,

190
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:47,620
you know,

191
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,420
10 12 years of doing this work,

192
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:49,901
hard core,

193
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:51,700
I think they really know and I think,

194
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,151
you know,

195
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:52,780
they live in a,

196
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,570
in a timescale that's a lot broader
than we've given them credit for.

197
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,680
When you do see

198
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,480
all this stuff on TV,

199
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,800
one thing that you can't deny,

200
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,930
it might not affect you
and it might not affect me,

201
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,800
but there are certain people that fall
the tone of the leaders of this country.

202
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,100
And when you have a guy who's the
president who you know is going to say

203
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:12,981
insulting,

204
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:16,680
should call John Stewart a pussy and
an in a tweet at one 30 in the morning,

205
00:06:16,681 --> 00:06:20,540
like that sets the tone for the country
and it's going to make some people very

206
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:21,200
happy.

207
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,050
There's some people that love to talk
shit they loved and salt people on the

208
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,231
like,

209
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,064
fuck yeah,

210
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,120
open season.

211
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,171
The way I described it,

212
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:30,830
I said political correctness
took a missile to the dick
cause that's what it was

213
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:31,021
like.

214
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:31,520
He's like,

215
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,180
this is the,

216
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,450
this is the guy at the top
of the totem pole and we,

217
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:38,350
we can relax our standards now and all
the things that have been annoying you,

218
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:42,010
but people nitpicking about
behaviors and insults and you know,

219
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,230
safe words and safe spaces and
all that stuff's Kinda gone.

220
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,610
Oh yeah.

221
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,121
I mean,

222
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:47,450
yeah.

223
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,380
So it does affect the way people
think and behave right there.

224
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,580
There's almost nobody who won't
use the word Pussy in public there.

225
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,510
Do you remember so many months
ago when that just wasn't a thing?

226
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,650
That's so true.

227
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,640
You couldn't say that.

228
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,840
That's so drew.

229
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,440
It became like a constant
like dinner table talk.

230
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,600
Like people sit around and
talk at saint grabbed the busy.

231
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,140
Yeah.

232
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,060
It's got to be from women.

233
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,580
That's how it got even better.

234
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,240
My girlfriend said it's true.

235
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,230
It's so true.

236
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,670
That is so true.

237
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,960
That's interesting.

238
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,500
Yeah.

239
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,333
Well,

240
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,880
you know,

241
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,780
I think that we go one way and we go to
the other and I think that people get

242
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,280
tired of too much left and they want some.

243
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:25,580
Right.

244
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,340
And I think that's why we
went from Carter to Reagan.

245
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,140
That's why we went from Bush to Clinton.

246
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,640
I just think that's what we do,

247
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,130
I think is what we've always done.

248
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:42,560
Okay.
