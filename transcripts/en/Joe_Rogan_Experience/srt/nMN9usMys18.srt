1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,890
The joe rogan experience.
I,

2
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:04,380
uh,
I came just behind you guys and one of

3
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:07,620
my big regrets is that I never got to
perform with the Ding Ho cause it was so

4
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:08,540
legendary.
Yeah.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,810
Well it's because the,
the,

6
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,280
the,
the comics were in charge basically,

7
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:13,850
you know,
booking and the,

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,060
all that stuff.
So it was,

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,171
it was,
yeah,

10
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,720
it was crazy.
Well that's sort of how the comedy store

11
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:20,820
used to be except for the booking aspect
of it.

12
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,710
You know,
the comics will never in charge of,

13
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,370
but there was still,
but there's no real crowd control.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,290
There was no,
all comics work in the booth.

15
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,700
Comics would work.
The door,

16
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,280
the comedy store was like,
it's all comics working.

17
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:33,020
Well this was,

18
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:33,831
this was,
yeah,

19
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:38,480
this was pretty even much may ham and
eggs guy a shun Lee.

20
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:42,530
He ran the Ding Ho and a talked to me
maybe twice.

21
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,290
One night I go out on stage and I'm
doing my character and I,

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,690
you know,
I'm full bore,

23
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,151
right.
And then,

24
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:51,590
um,
I stop and I say,

25
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:52,010
you know,
hi,

26
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,890
this is my real voice.
I'd like to gut and clean some fish

27
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,560
tonight.
Does anyone have any fish?

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,520
You know,
really straight.

29
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:01,130
I'm saying this in,
my roommate raises his hand and he pulls

30
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:03,770
out this big fish.
Now the fish have been in the trunk of

31
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:05,540
his car,
so it's rancid.

32
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh No,
I just got the fish and gut and trails

33
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,160
and trails all over the stage.
And this woman just contact vomit as

34
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:14,030
soon as she smelled it.
Just,

35
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,300
Oh,
so I'm a professional.

36
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:21,040
I put the mic right down to her from he
or retching over the PA

37
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:26,570
chicks,
shooken up this fish gut vomit all over

38
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:28,900
the front of this days.
And then I go,

39
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:29,820
well thank you.
Good night.

40
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,163
[inaudible]

41
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,600
she was bill Campbell around when
you're,

42
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:35,480
oh,
this guy,

43
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,610
really sweet guy.
But his act as you know,

44
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:38,690
talking about,
you know,

45
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:39,830
relationships,
you know,

46
00:01:39,831 --> 00:01:40,790
men go to me,
you know?

47
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,890
Yeah.
It's just guts and fishing.

48
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,023
And he goes,
uh,

49
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,770
you know,
so he,

50
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:49,520
his act is destroyed because overbook,
this kind of stuff.

51
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,450
So yeah,
very nice,

52
00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:53,450
wholesome kind of heck.
And then I did this and then Sean Lee,

53
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:54,970
there's only time,
first time he talked to me,

54
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,350
he goes,
he pulls me over to talk to him.

55
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:01,220
He goes by you weird.
He said,

56
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,360
fuck,
are you weird?

57
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,310
Wow.
What a great boss.

58
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,031
Yeah,
yeah.

59
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:05,601
That was,
yeah.

60
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,250
It was like,
I still did this,

61
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,300
you know,
second show,

62
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,370
don't do the fish.
You know,

63
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,180
it's hilarious.
No,

64
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:17,020
the true shamonic tradition is,
it was explained to me,

65
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,490
um,
by uh,

66
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,990
this Guy Jack hair and he said that the
idea is that you,

67
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,330
you eat the,
the drug,

68
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,630
the plant Mush chaminade a miscarriage
has a very different,

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,150
it's not so Simon,
it's some other type of,

70
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,340
what you're shooting for is a Jessica
Mall.

71
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,650
You're should,
the active compound is musket ball and

72
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:37,840
what its Axon a very different mechanism
actually.

73
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,660
Yeah.
So the mechanism of action of m Anita

74
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,970
Miscarry,
it actually acts as a Gaba agonist.

75
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,120
So it's going to give you more of the
neurotransmitter Gaba.

76
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,020
Whereas siliciden the mechanism of
action that there recently finding,

77
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:52,060
which I learned a lot about it,
the maps conferences,

78
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,830
mechanism of action of silicide been is
it's actually restricting blood flow to

79
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,990
your default mode network,
part of your brain,

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,320
which is your top down control mechanism
in your brain so that you're basically

81
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:08,120
your mental cerebral filter that allows
you to focus on the day to day mundane

82
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:11,510
tasks starts to go to sleep and that
happens to be the center that controls

83
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:15,200
depression and a bunch of other things,
which is why the clinical application is

84
00:03:15,201 --> 00:03:18,590
proving so important and impressive and
all these people,

85
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,170
but that's a totally different mechanism
of action.

86
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,890
Then the Amanita miscarried,
which is basically flooding your brain

87
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,160
with more Gaba from what I understand,
but the musk,

88
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:30,200
Amal,
is a tricky beast and it doesn't

89
00:03:30,201 --> 00:03:33,020
necessarily come out through your gut.
However,

90
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,960
once it gets processed through your
kidneys and you piss it,

91
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,090
it can be passed up to five times.
They say through different people.

92
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,230
So like I could Piss,

93
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,490
oh sure,
you could drink it,

94
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,960
you could piss,
give it to Brian,

95
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,600
he can take it.
And then Brian could give it to two

96
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,760
other people and everybody will be high
as fuck.

97
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,030
Wow.
What they say?

98
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,950
How'd they know?
How would they know?

99
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:58,410
Why would they find out?
What are we doing with our lives?

100
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:00,460
We're sitting around and drinking each
other's pissed to get high.

101
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,180
What are you seeing in fairies?
Cock sucker.

102
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,790
They love drinking,
watching Pluto.

103
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,440
The sure fire way if you really want to
commit is to eat it and then drink.

104
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,420
You're pissed and then you can,
you know,

105
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,030
you feel so stupid.
If it didn't work,

106
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,820
that's true.
Sitting there with piss mouth and not

107
00:04:17,821 --> 00:04:19,980
high and just taking what kind of a
loser ham.

108
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,990
I should just become a republican.
Okay.

109
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:26,130
I should just go the other way and get
single malt scotch and sneaking some

110
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:29,690
Cuban cigars and just become an asphalt
or renting a movie while I'm,

111
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,000
but if it works,
eating mushrooms and drinking piss the

112
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:37,650
fuck am I doing with my life?

113
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,460
You got a dirty garage like I was going
to get to that,

114
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:44,310
but I had to eat mushrooms and drink my
own piss first.

115
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,870
I'm going to fucking real winter over
here.

116
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,940
I'm going to film it for,
for all the savages.

117
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,380
See what's up because it is perfectly
legal in the US.

118
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,400
I've never met anybody who's had a good
one.

119
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,930
Is it a good a amnesia,
miscarry experience?

120
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,160
Not that I remember anybody telling me
about one.

121
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,140
They've always said like,
oh,

122
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:01,410
it didn't work for me.
Yeah,

123
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,310
I met somebody who had a weird one and a
not so good one.

124
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,500
Hmm.
I drink tea bro.

125
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,780
Weird and not so good,
but there is pissed drinking so come on.

126
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,320
There's such a tradition around it
though,

127
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,760
you know?
I don't mean that we can all check each

128
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:19,970
other's pissed by.
Come on,

129
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,510
hop.
He's got it all figured out.

130
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,930
You just got to get a fresh I.
This is in to you and then you pissing

131
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,471
him.
No,

132
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:25,981
no,
no.

133
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:29,040
See that's not how it's done.
I forgot to bring cups.

134
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,760
We all thought how it works.
I just pissing your mouth straight from

135
00:05:32,761 --> 00:05:35,580
the spout kind of potty.
We doing here the freshest way to get

136
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,290
his ass in your mouth.
We're going to work this out.

137
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,380
We're going to get high as fuck.

138
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,650
It's exactly what
he's trying to trick us.

139
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,250
Stumble upon this fucking party.
Open up the tent door.

140
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,350
What the fuck?
Piss all over the place.

141
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:56,400
Bunch of guys,
the Cox,

142
00:05:56,401 --> 00:05:58,430
Nan's.
We're just trying to get enlightenment.

143
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,970
But imagine if it does work and you get
someone really high and they love it and

144
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:04,060
then you could trick them constantly.
The Yo,

145
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,500
I just cause my pitch.
