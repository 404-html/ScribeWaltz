1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,080
That reminds me of the
first time I bought drugs.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,790
The first time I ever bought drugs.

4
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:06,640
Tell me what you remember.

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,780
Do remember the first time you ever
[inaudible] told me that you had a story?

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,370
I met the first time about drugs.

7
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:16,371
I was in high school and I went to a
small high school so I was trying to be

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,620
like not make a thing to
ask about it at first.

9
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,160
You know,

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,950
cause you don't want it to get
around and like be a cause.

11
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:24,330
So you were curious.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:24,601
Yeah,

13
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,690
I wanted to try stuff but I didn't know
who to ask because if you ask like at a

14
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:29,790
small school you're like
it could blow up real fast.

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,260
That's how guys would traveled.

16
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,330
So my friend Steve had just transferred
from like the big high school,

17
00:00:36,331 --> 00:00:38,580
like from a high school
with like 5,000 kids.

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,200
And so it was like a weekend.

19
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,531
I was like,

20
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:41,311
let's get a sack.

21
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:44,730
And I think we had just seen
menace to society and we were like,

22
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:45,270
it was up,

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,000
but we were trying to totally
be like hardcore guys.

24
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,900
I'm like pulling the hat
to the side and be like,

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,480
did you wear your hat to the side?

26
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:51,931
No,

27
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:52,411
but I think,

28
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:52,700
uh,

29
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,040
you know a lot of like throwing
swag into shit and being like,

30
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,070
hey,

31
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,903
it was good a sac.

32
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,250
You get your blackness on.

33
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,360
Definitely feel it.

34
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,520
14 like what's up dude?

35
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,000
This shit.

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,950
I got your back making shit up.

37
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:05,521
Little too white,

38
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:05,780
right?

39
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,210
Yeah.

40
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,890
And so comfortable with your existence.

41
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,490
Totally.

42
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,270
And then,

43
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,103
uh,

44
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,600
he's like,

45
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,101
I'll hook,

46
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:11,934
I know the guy.

47
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,490
So this is like a Saturday night.

48
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,440
This like long green,

49
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,810
like old school seventies
Cadillac pulls up and,

50
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,131
and like,

51
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:20,401
he's like,

52
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:22,920
that's the dude and this
guy rolls the window down.

53
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,161
He's like,

54
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:23,371
Yo,

55
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:24,180
get in the back.

56
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,660
And I was like,

57
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:24,901
all right,

58
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:25,290
cool.

59
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,570
We get in the back if the thinking
like that's where it goes down.

60
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,090
And uh,

61
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,971
Steve is like,

62
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,061
Yo,

63
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:30,894
this is white Pete.

64
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:31,531
And I was like,

65
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:32,790
what's up White Pete?

66
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Like he was called White Pete cause they
needed to give him a distinction for

67
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,130
his name because he was the only
white guy that ran with his crew.

68
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,820
Right.

69
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,780
And he was like,

70
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,000
we didn't have driver's licenses.

71
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,770
So he was like,

72
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:50,220
exactly what we at that moment when
we want it to be in a couple of years.

73
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:51,990
Like he had like the whole unit,

74
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:54,420
like the oversized white tea and like,

75
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:54,840
you know,

76
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,710
gold chain.

77
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,351
Yeah.

78
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:57,210
And fucking like fate.

79
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:57,631
And he was like,

80
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:58,021
what's up?

81
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:58,561
I'm white people.

82
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,090
He talked like snoop Dogg almost.

83
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,990
Oh right.

84
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,790
And so we were like,

85
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,590
all right,

86
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,300
I thought he was like,

87
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,410
so we're going to go get it now.

88
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:04,771
I was like,

89
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:05,540
go get what?

90
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,900
Like I thought we were
just doing this in the car.

91
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,550
I wouldn't go get that sac man.

92
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,030
I'm like,

93
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,391
oh,

94
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:10,224
okay.

95
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,951
So we start driving,

96
00:02:10,951 --> 00:02:13,020
we go 30 minutes in a car,

97
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,400
we go to the next town over,

98
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,450
which is Fort Pierce,

99
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,510
which is definitely a shittier place,

100
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,261
right.

101
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:24,000
So we're driving through Fort Pierce and
we go from a main street to like single

102
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:24,691
lane highways.

103
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:24,891
You know,

104
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:25,710
in Florida there's like,

105
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,060
oh yeah.

106
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,260
I said,

107
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,851
we're on a busy,

108
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:29,370
and then we go to a single lane
that has like canals on each side.

109
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,090
Ooh.

110
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:30,450
Yeah.

111
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:30,900
And we're driving.

112
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,100
And then we go from that to a dirt road
and then the dirt road off of that dirt

113
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:37,310
road that we're driving down with.

114
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,940
Like this is some forensic files.

115
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:39,300
Shit.

116
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,350
Like we're going to end up on,

117
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,370
there's a lot of woods.

118
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:41,960
Yeah,

119
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,793
a lot of brush,

120
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,230
uh,

121
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:43,831
groves,

122
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,550
that kind of shit.

123
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:44,911
I was like,

124
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:45,744
fuck man.

125
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,561
And at this point,

126
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:50,240
like I'm thinking about like
menace to society and they're like,

127
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,420
I want to be in that right now.

128
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,260
But in feeling like,

129
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:52,740
ah,

130
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,580
feeling really white,

131
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,430
my like really scared and so,

132
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,610
and now it's night and it,

133
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,140
you know,

134
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:58,471
it's like,

135
00:02:58,471 --> 00:02:58,761
because we,

136
00:02:58,761 --> 00:02:58,990
it,

137
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,340
he came over in the evening already,

138
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,090
so it was pitch black outside and we're
on a dirt road off of a dirt road.

139
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,590
Like you can scream,

140
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,060
there's nobody gonna hear Shit.

141
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,300
And on the dirt road gravel path,

142
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:13,240
I see a light and the
light is from a trailer.

143
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,560
So we pull up to the trailer
and we get out and it's me,

144
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,700
Steve and white Pete.

145
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,990
And we knock on the door,

146
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,340
that trailer and this dude opens the door
and he has his black guy that has like

147
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:25,930
six dreadlocks,

148
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,320
like you know,

149
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,130
each dreadlock is like a size of like a
king size snicker bar and he's got six

150
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:33,200
snicker bars coming out
of his hair and wipe.

151
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:33,431
He's like,

152
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,270
what's up Pat Pat?

153
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:34,601
And he's like,

154
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:35,470
what's up White Pete?

155
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,551
And they give each other,

156
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:36,850
how can,

157
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,211
I was like,

158
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:37,781
oh fuck.

159
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:38,141
Like no,

160
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:40,540
this really is like totally
menace to society shit.

161
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,374
Right?

162
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,480
But I'm told try.

163
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,800
So trying to be cool about it.

164
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,311
Like,

165
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,540
so trying to be cool about it.

166
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,800
And then uh,

167
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,870
he's like these white boys
looking for a sack and he's like,

168
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:50,021
yeah,

169
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,854
we could do that.

170
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,401
So we go on.

171
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:51,881
So the mind you,

172
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:54,250
we're looking for $20 and we like,

173
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,800
we drove.

174
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,643
And how long has it taken?

175
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,060
This is from his point.

176
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,700
It's like we're already 30
miles southwest of the city.

177
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:01,121
We started,

178
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,490
would you just say like
never mind after 10 miles

179
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,300
white peach of solid to you,

180
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,280
why does he have to take you
on the trip to the guy's house?

181
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,610
I would,

182
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,840
these are all questions I have,

183
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,040
but don't have the balls to ask.

184
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,671
Like I,

185
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:13,451
I'm in my mind,

186
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:13,780
I'm like,

187
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,140
ah,

188
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,040
like I'm 14,

189
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:17,140
15 and I'm not saying shit to this dude.

190
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,370
I'm cool.

191
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,090
What's up?

192
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,820
He's get a sack full time.

193
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,660
So we go into his trailer and he's like,

194
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,320
all right,

195
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,430
we're going to get to do that sec.

196
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,743
Uh,

197
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
we back in 10 minutes.

198
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,641
I was like,

199
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:32,020
who would be back in 10 minutes?

200
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,381
He's like,

201
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:35,380
we will be you stay
here and watch my place.

202
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,891
And I was like,

203
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,724
what?

204
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,061
Like,

205
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,680
what the fuck are you talking about?

206
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,000
Is what I'm thinking?

207
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,081
But then I just go like,

208
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:41,440
yeah,

209
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,130
cool.

210
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,910
Totally.

211
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,810
You're in his trailer.

212
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,561
And he's like,

213
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:45,394
watch it for me.

214
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,480
And I'm like,

215
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,500
oh no.

216
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,030
Like I'm feeling like that,

217
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,470
like real fear.

218
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,490
But I go,

219
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,120
yeah,

220
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,953
no problem man.

221
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,780
I watched people's houses all the time,

222
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,900
like it totally fucking terrified.

223
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,690
And then he goes like the,

224
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,780
you walk in the trailer,

225
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,700
you're in the living room because
that's the way it trained leaders.

226
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:03,881
Right.

227
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,714
You walk into it,

228
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,920
it was a bedroom to the right.

229
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,560
He's like waiting here on the bed.

230
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:08,830
He's like,

231
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,590
it was a 45 and a 12 gauge and he goes,

232
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,850
anybody comes into my,

233
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,684
in my house,

234
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,670
you shoot him.

235
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,340
And I was like,

236
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,060
right.

237
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,680
And then he was like a for my Mama,

238
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,610
my mama comes home,

239
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,320
don't shoot her.

240
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:19,900
And I was like,

241
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,460
got it and accept.

242
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,990
I kept trying to be cool about it.

243
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:23,824
I was like,

244
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,101
yeah,

245
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:24,934
like that's what's up.

246
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:25,361
I know,

247
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:25,961
I know what you're saying,

248
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:26,794
man.

249
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,423
Go get that sac.

250
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,210
Totally like trying to be like,

251
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:31,680
he was like,

252
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,350
all right.

253
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,161
They walk out,

254
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:38,161
they leave me in his trailer with two
guns and a fucking message to not to shoot

255
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:42,820
everybody but his mother and I just
sit there and watch the MTV video music

256
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:44,530
awards and the whole time,

257
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:45,340
like every show that comes,

258
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,581
I just,

259
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:46,414
I'm rocking.

260
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,820
I'm actually hoping that it's an intruder
versus his mom because I feel like if

261
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:52,654
it's his mom,

262
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,040
she accidentally shoot her or I or how
is she going to react to my explanation.

263
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,510
Pep had just told me to wait here.

264
00:05:59,570 --> 00:05:59,641
Oh,

265
00:05:59,641 --> 00:06:01,040
he's getting some weed for me,

266
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:01,371
but I'm,

267
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:02,480
that's what I'm supposed
to shoot everybody,

268
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,314
but you

269
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,390
are you cool with that?

270
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,291
And she's like,

271
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:06,691
Oh yeah,

272
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:08,630
it happens all it like how are
you going to react to this?

273
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,350
So I fuck,

274
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,080
I mean I'm having a panic attack.

275
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,890
We finally,

276
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,723
they come back,

277
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,690
we get back in with a white Pete.

278
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,540
He drives us back and I'm sitting there,

279
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,180
I'm like,

280
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,260
what the fuck dude,

281
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,370
that was the worst shit ever.

282
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,730
Like I'm fucking terrified.

283
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,051
He was like,

284
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,380
yeah,

285
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:24,951
him and Pat,

286
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,784
Pat,

287
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,080
pat became like best friends.

288
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,000
So they became like super close.

289
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,890
Like that was like his guy
would go to and I'd be like,

290
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,520
no dude,

291
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,560
I don't want to hang
out with half ad at all.

292
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,740
And like six months later
when Steve got his license,

293
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,030
we went and he was like,

294
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:38,870
you want to get some weed today?

295
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:39,201
I was like,

296
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:39,560
yeah,

297
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,771
yeah,

298
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:39,981
yeah.

299
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,150
So where we go,

300
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,110
we go to Fort Pierce,

301
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,760
pull it to pat Pat's and I'm like,

302
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,480
God damn it.

303
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,280
And like she remembered how to get there.

304
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:46,701
He did.

305
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,260
Steve had started going
there all the time.

306
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,310
Oh my God.

307
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,640
We pulled up to his trailer this time
he gets out now this time I'm like,

308
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:53,460
well they're friends.

309
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,700
This is probably gonna
be a much quicker thing.

310
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,301
He comes out,

311
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,560
he jumps in the back and he's like,

312
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:57,981
all right,

313
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:58,461
let's roll.

314
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:58,940
And I was like,

315
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,420
ah,

316
00:06:59,420 --> 00:06:59,990
no,

317
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,290
like fucking look for a sack again.

318
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,760
Like I thought you just have this.

319
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,090
So this time we went to this,

320
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:10,790
but these are things [inaudible] scared
the shit out of me the first time.

321
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,260
But that second time he saved our life
actually because we went from his trailer

322
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:17,150
the second time where
he jumped in the back,

323
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,380
went to Avenue d,

324
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,590
which is the fucking shitty
street in Fort Pierce.

325
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,960
Like if you're going to like every city,

326
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:24,794
you know you have like,

327
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,430
I dunno,

328
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,740
whatever city you're in
there like that's ever seen.

329
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,580
If you've been to the street where you
see open drug dealing where there's not

330
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:33,500
even some type of facade Angeles,

331
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:33,771
right,

332
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,690
but you've been down a
street where there's like,

333
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:36,920
there's no pretense about it.

334
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,570
There's just like Los Angeles.

335
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:39,320
What's,

336
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,150
which part of the film and fear factor?

337
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:44,660
We were actually filming the playboy
playmate addition of fear factor downtown

338
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:45,180
area.

339
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:45,430
Yeah.

340
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,970
We were watching people sell drugs,

341
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,260
smoked crack right there.

342
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,850
We were in a crane and we're like,

343
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,421
I go look,

344
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,260
they're smoking crack.

345
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,980
And the girl's like,

346
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,401
oh my God,

347
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:54,620
they are smoking crack and
like this is ridiculous.

348
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,080
No one's protecting us.

349
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,990
We're up here on a crane.

350
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,020
That was exactly like this where we pulled
up in in Steve's car and the windows

351
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,160
come down and we just get surrounded.

352
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,860
Like the car got surrounded by six guys
and they reached in their jackets and

353
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:11,770
they go at this one guy who was,

354
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,270
y'all look familiar and
this other guy goes,

355
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:14,421
yeah,

356
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:15,470
y'all are real familiar.

357
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,940
Y'All ever been here before?

358
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,660
And that when you,

359
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,760
when somebody says that you look familiar,

360
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:20,594
have you been here before?

361
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,763
How would you answer that?

362
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,060
I just say,

363
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,450
nope.

364
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,990
Nope.

365
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:24,490
All right.

366
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,940
And exactly at that moment I go,

367
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,570
no.

368
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,010
And Steve at the exact same it goes,

369
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,883
Yup.

370
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,113
Yeah

371
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,731
man.

372
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,361
And then they're like,

373
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:32,541
see,

374
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,380
I told you man,

375
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,341
y'all look like them.

376
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:34,851
White Boys.

377
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:36,440
They've been snatching bags around here.

378
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,030
I was like,

379
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,110
Oh fuck.

380
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,800
Like you look like the white boys
that haven't taken bags from guys.

381
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:43,821
I'm like,

382
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:44,151
no,

383
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:44,600
dude,

384
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,500
that's not us.

385
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:45,891
It seems like,

386
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:46,730
but we have been here before.

387
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:46,941
I'm like,

388
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:49,280
will you shut the fuck up?

389
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:49,820
Pat?

390
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,960
Pat is in the back of like,

391
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:51,450
hold on.

392
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:53,400
He gets out and like walks up,

393
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,470
talks to all of them.

394
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:54,681
Like,

395
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,350
uh,

396
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,740
you know,

397
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,060
like he's the ambassador,

398
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:57,391
right?

399
00:08:57,391 --> 00:08:57,661
And like,

400
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:58,530
I don't know what the fuck you're like,

401
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,860
I own these guys there with me.

402
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:00,181
He's like,

403
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:00,930
fucking,

404
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,010
and they totally let us go.

405
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,540
Yeah.

406
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,330
But if without,

407
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,350
without him we would've been fucked.

408
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:05,460
What's that noise?

409
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,620
What is that noise?

410
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,990
That's not mine.

411
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,823
That's me.

412
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:11,791
Pat,

413
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,210
Pat,

414
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:12,481
Pat,

415
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:12,930
pat.

416
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,201
Pat.

417
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:13,760
Pat is still,

418
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
I don't know where it happened to pat.

419
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,090
Pat.

420
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:15,721
And why Pete,

421
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,530
who knows what happened?

422
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,340
Good things.

423
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,240
Probably not good things,

424
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:18,660
man.

425
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,351
You said Facebook,

426
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,184
um,

427
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,590
can you fix book pap Pap Pap?

428
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,430
That would be the next person that
makes up a fake Twitter account.

429
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:26,264
That's a real fee.

430
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:26,851
That was,

431
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,780
I had real fear.

432
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,530
Oh yeah.

433
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,070
You're like,

434
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,090
for good fucking reason.

435
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:30,291
Oh.

436
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,830
Like when you feel your
stomach drop and you're like,

437
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,450
what's going to happen right now?

438
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,560
Oh my God.

439
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,010
Yeah.

440
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,880
That's terrible shit,

441
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:36,714
man.

442
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,070
Okay.
