1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,890
Just talk.
We're good.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,450
All right.
We're live sort of sorta.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,570
We're,
we're rolling.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,650
We're rolling.
We're rolling.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,670
We're rolling.
Dog.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,020
So,
uh,

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,110
so we were talking about the game we 
stopped because we figured it's probably

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,270
be good for the podcast.
So Ari finally paid off the bat.

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,880
I paid it off in a big way,
man,

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,680
in a big way.
Um,

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,470
so if you remember when we were doing 
the weight loss challenge,

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,900
it was like whoever wins decides the 
sporting event,

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,730
we're all sports fans basically,
you know,

14
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:38,400
and,
and I said at the time I was like,

15
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:41,520
let's go see Barcelona.
I think I wanted to say Barcelona,

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,480
play Paris in the,
you know,

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,700
some tournament cups,
some channel,

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,620
a tournament that they were playing in.
And I was like,

19
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:51,540
you know,
two of the premier teams and it'd be fun

20
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:53,400
to go to Europe and make already pay for
it,

21
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,234
you know,
so.

22
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,570
So I told him that and he was like,
I'm going to like fucking Malaysia.

23
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,080
And he just left.
So I never heard from him again.

24
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:03,060
Then four months later,
you know how it all,

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,280
it all played out.
So when he got back,

26
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,114
he was getting fucking slammed by people
because he was supposed to pay up this 

27
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,394
bet,
you know,

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,590
and people were destroying him,
you know,

29
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:14,490
that I mean,
online,

30
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,311
they were just like,
well true,

31
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:17,550
you're a piece of shit.
Probably worse than that.

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,103
But,
um,

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,760
anyways,
once we got,

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,060
we got to like hanging out.
Once we did the sober October thing,

35
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,880
um,
he was just like,

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,100
right before that actually,
I think he was like,

37
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,453
well,
go.

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,040
Which means like,
what do you want to do?

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,091
Right?
And I go,

40
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:36,210
well,
how about I go,

41
00:01:36,211 --> 00:01:37,110
uh,
he was like,

42
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,090
you know,
you pick the event.

43
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,930
I go,
I'm a big college football fan.

44
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,280
Let's go to the national championship 
game.

45
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,950
I remember,
uh,

46
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,203
in 20,
at the end of 2013 season 2014 Fsu and 

47
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:52,980
Auburn played in the rosebowl out here 
and Burton Fsu alum.

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,840
I'm a big FSU fan.
I was like,

49
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:57,330
let's go to the game.
And I remember that we met,

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,253
uh,
it was like we kind of somebody who had 

51
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,880
student because they both always win the
national championship.

52
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:07,350
They allow students to go to the game 
for pretty expensive,

53
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,150
much less than the general public can go
for.

54
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,143
In other words,
because you want students have the 

55
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:17,151
ability to go to see their school play.
So we got like student tickets for,

56
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,624
I think they were three slash 50 each 
and that's pretty expensive especially 

57
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,210
for a student.
But I remember burt treated me.

58
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,044
He,
he bought the ticket for me and we went 

59
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,504
to that,
to that game and he left that fucking 

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,850
halftime of the national championship 
game.

61
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,020
Why'd he leave?
He was,

62
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,120
I'm tired.
I got to see the kids had been drinking.

63
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,173
He left.
There was one of the best players left 

64
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,740
you there yet?
We were sitting in separate sections,

65
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,750
but I was like,
are you fucking.

66
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,140
I was like texting him.
He was like,

67
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,030
so you were by yourself and he was by 
himself?

68
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,720
Yeah,
yeah.

69
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,553
When he knew more people at the game 
because a lot of his friends that he 

70
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,600
went to school with were at the game 
too,

71
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,860
but I'm like,
you're gone.

72
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,390
Did you see the kickoff return that just
the lead just like swung.

73
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,040
He was like,
I'm at home.

74
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,030
I was like,
alright,

75
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,040
so alright psycho.
So weird.

76
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,030
I,
I gave him shit for it.

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
I still give them shit for it,
but it ended up being just this amazing 

78
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:06,760
finish.
So anyways,

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,880
when I tell red I want to go to this,
I'm kinda thinking that's the ballpark.

80
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,440
Like because that's the only experience 
I have.

81
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,880
So the games in Atlanta,
he buys tickets and I'm like,

82
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,140
I go,
you're not flying me coach,

83
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:20,830
you know that.
He's like,

84
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,200
no,
you go first bird rookies,

85
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,630
coach,
you don't work as coach.

86
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,880
And I'll give them a seat bill 
extension.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,240
Oh cool.
But burden ended up going from somewhere

88
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:31,841
else.
So anyways,

89
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,030
he bought the ticket,
he got an Airbnb,

90
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,790
a really nice house,
you know,

91
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,150
for a few days in Atlanta.
And then it's a,

92
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,890
you know,
the big thing is game day.

93
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,753
I'm thinking like,
oh that's cool that you got these 

94
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,520
tickets and you got,
you know,

95
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,440
but I think it's reasonable.
And then we get to the stadium.

96
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,080
It was a total fucking disaster to get 
in because trump went to the game.

97
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,363
So it was raining.
It was wet secret service everywhere to 

98
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:01,330
our lines to get into the venue and I 
paid a guy,

99
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:05,320
a security guy 100 bucks to walk us 
through the line,

100
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,154
which is,
which was almost impossible because it 

101
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,240
was so packed,
but I dunno,

102
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,860
he just started walking us through the 
line,

103
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,850
like in front of people.

104
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,710
People were yelling at the security guy,
which was like so uncomfortable.

105
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:20,890
He's like a young black kid and like old
white people,

106
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:22,630
where the fuck are you doing?
He's like,

107
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,590
I'm security,
and they're like,

108
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,430
you're not security you piece of shit 
like right to is right in front of us.

109
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,660
And I was like,
God damn,

110
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,793
like,
I just have never seen someone flip out 

111
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,550
like that.
What we were doing was highly unethical.

112
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:34,384
We shouldn't have done it,
but like we just weren't going to wait 

113
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,600
in that line.
And then burt,

114
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,160
of course,
bird in a crowd like that,

115
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:40,510
he's like,
it's okay.

116
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,433
I'm famous.
Were famous guys like yelling that to 

117
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:44,530
people,
which is like,

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,610
no,
you didn't.

119
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,780
Oh absolutely.
He's like,

120
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:47,890
he's like,
we're everywhere we went.

121
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,050
If we went to a restaurant,
they would come up and be like,

122
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,730
Hey,
can I get you guys something to drink?

123
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,380
And he'd be like,
do you recognize this?

124
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,120
We were like,
they were like,

125
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:58,990
what was he serious?
I think it's part of his like,

126
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,270
you know,
whatever style.

127
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,440
And then.
And they were like,

128
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,303
I'm sorry,
so part of a joke or part of kind of a 

129
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,810
joy.
He's joking but I'm not.

130
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,180
He's like halfway in the middle because 
one time,

131
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,043
one time he was like,
we were famous comedians and the lady 

132
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:13,601
was like,
Oh,

133
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,830
I know who you are.
And he was like,

134
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,450
isn't it ultimately the famous guys shut
up and he was serious.

135
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,150
I mean he's like half serious.
He's like,

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,370
but it's like you see him in his 
element.

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,400
It's like him in with crowds is really 
like,

138
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,590
you realize that he really enjoys it.
Like he really enjoys the large groups.

139
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,614
He enjoys being recognized.
He fucking like sometimes we were 

140
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:40,330
walking and people were like,
Hey,

141
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,940
you're the guy,
I've seen you on facebook.

142
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,810
He's like,
you want a picture?

143
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,100
And they're like,
okay.

144
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,300
Yeah,
he loves it.

145
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,660
He loves it and then we were talking 
about how like people would say,

146
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,290
like,
Tom and I were like,

147
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,124
yeah,
and they're like,

148
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,600
hey,
and then they would walk away,

149
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,150
they wouldn't come over to me.
They were like hi.

150
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,430
And then they'd walk in another way.
But with birth they're like,

151
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,430
hug you to take their shirt off.
They love,

152
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,490
they love it and he's like in his glory 
with it is perfect.

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,953
So anyways,
we get through this horrific line into 

154
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:15,764
this unbelievable.
One point $6,000,000,000 stadium that 

155
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,590
they built in Atlanta.
I mean,

156
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,480
it looks fucking amazing.
It's such a beautiful.

157
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,820
Just standalone stadium,
you know,

158
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,850
is so state of the art.
It's incredible.

159
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,410
We get in there are,
he got us 50 yard line,

160
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,380
so right in the middle,
like 20 rows back and I'm like,

161
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,550
these are fucking amazing.
Like you couldn't ask for better seats.

162
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,700
It has like some club access for like 
free booze,

163
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,920
free food,
catered food,

164
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,270
prime rib.
I'm like,

165
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,290
Jesus.
I'm like,

166
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,370
how much did you pay for these tickets?
And he's like,

167
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:56,170
Oh yeah,
I want to know $3,500 each.

168
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,040
Whoa.
I was like,

169
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,230
are you fucking shit?
And he was like,

170
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,320
Oh,
do it,

171
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,153
do it.

172
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,390
But he spent over 10 grand on tickets 
for us.

173
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,630
Wow.
Yeah.

174
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:10,820
Wow.
Unreal,

175
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,260
man.
That's amazing.

176
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,550
I mean those are,
those are great seats to like,

177
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,450
those are absolutely amazing seats.
You know,

178
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:20,660
when the Mcgregor Mayweather fight was 
going on.

179
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,533
Yeah,
I was hearing that people were buying 

180
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:25,490
tickets for a quarter million dollars.
That's fucking retarded.

181
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,743
That's so dumb to pay that much money.
But you're balling pretty hard right 

182
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,680
now.
I mean,

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,780
back in the day he thought about some of
the shit that you're.

184
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,220
Oh,
you can do now.

185
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,090
Yeah,
that's true.

186
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,470
I would be like,
that's impossible.

187
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,230
So we were talking about Jeff Bezos 
before the show,

188
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,270
who's now the richest man in human 
history.

189
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,700
It's like,
it's inconceivable amount of money.

190
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,820
He's worth $105,000,000,000.
Right?

191
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,230
Which is just like,
what the fuck?

192
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,080
He's like the eighth biggest landowner 
in the United States.

193
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,370
Do you know that?
He just buys.

194
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,040
It's crazy.

195
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
Yeah.
And I'm not certain though.

196
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,050
No,
of course not.

197
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,540
She goes 300,000 acres of Texas.
Whoa.

198
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,350
That's a lot.
That's a lot.

199
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,760
Yeah.
That's a big slab.

200
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,850
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure it's just balling out of

201
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:07,684
control.
I'm pretty sure his DC home was either 

202
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:12,080
a.
I feel he was either a museum or a hotel

203
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:12,681
before.
He was like,

204
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:17,050
make that shit my house now.
It was a museum there,

205
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,490
like it's your house.
I wonder what he's like to hang out with

206
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,680
because there's a photo of him.
See if he could find this.

207
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:22,514
Photo of Jamie is a photo of Jeff Bezos 
from 1993 and he's got like a vinyl 

208
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,364
banner above his desk that says 
Amazon.com and it's just him and this 

209
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:34,874
Janky little fucking Ikea desk,
like bad kind of Chubby typing away and 

210
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,433
she got some muscle and he's jacked and 
Tan and probably got a supermodel for 

211
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,060
girlfriend.

212
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,240
Does he know he's got a wife for 
curricular?

213
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,290
Yeah.
Normal.

214
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,160
Yeah.
Really?

215
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,640
She's an author.
How long?

216
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,183
I know I'll have.
He doesn't schedule morning meetings so 

217
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,190
you can hang out with the kids.
Really?

218
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,330
Yeah.
Wow.

219
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,870
I read all this stuff.
I wonder why he's going so hard.

220
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,090
Hm.
You know,

221
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,790
when you hit 105 boop,
boop,

222
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:07,981
boop,
boop,

223
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,200
boop billion.
Yeah.

224
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,700
You would think you'd go,
Eh,

225
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,713
we're good.
I now I think you just start really 

226
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,650
collecting because you're like.
Because you know,

227
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,420
when he bought the Washington Post,
you know,

228
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:21,030
it's not like he's like,
I love journalism.

229
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:24,120
He be cool to own a newspaper.
You know what I mean?

230
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:26,580
Like what do you at that level,
you're just like,

231
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,490
I like waterfalls.
Are there any for sale or something?

232
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,353
You know,
he's got Washington Post is one of the 

233
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:36,240
weird ones where you get a link some,
they'll send you a link and you click on

234
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,460
it and it's a Washington Post article 
and it says,

235
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,380
you obviously love great journalists.

236
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,940
Right?
Sign up like fuck off.

237
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,730
They don't even give you the free reads.
I feel that New York Times will give you

238
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,520
10 free.
I signed up after I,

239
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,780
you know,
I kept clicking those.

240
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,590
I was like,
I didn't sign up Washington Post.

241
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,420
I feel like click number one.
They're like,

242
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,070
do you want to read this?
You have to pay or not?

243
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,920
Yeah,
I'm not,

244
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm not paying.
Yeah,

245
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:57,234
I mean I,
I,

246
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,113
I support paying for journalism,
but I feel like I should give us a 

247
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,090
taste.
You know,

248
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,003
we could get a little taste.
It's tough to trust journalism these 

249
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,743
days.
It's tough to trust like how fucking 

250
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,130
weird or your article's going to be.
That's true.

251
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,540
It's true.
Journalism was tough.

252
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,510
Watching news has become,
man.

253
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,890
I remember when it started to skew to 
personality and taste.

254
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,100
Now it's like off the rails.
It is off the rails.

255
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,450
That's where the money is.
I know,

256
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,600
but it's like you were totally just 
going with who?

257
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,493
Like you're going to watch,
you can select what do I feel like 

258
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,900
leaning towards.
Then you watch that.

259
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,700
Tucker Carlson.
Yeah.

260
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,410
Or you know.
Yeah.

261
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:39,690
Yeah.
Rachel maddow theory is.

262
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,240
That's that picture.
Oh my God.

263
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,160
Isn't that crazy?
Yes.

264
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,970
He looks nothing like that.
Now it's what 105 billion will do.

265
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,820
He's just sitting there with that 
Amazon.com banner.

266
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,680
I hope that's still hanging somewhere in
his house.

267
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,050
Yeah,
he probably shoots loads on that.

268
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,690
What do you.
Oh my God.

269
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,020
Yeah,
crazy that he started out.

270
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:05,630
I remember Amazon being a book thing.
Yeah.

271
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,473
I remember being a place to buy books 
and I remember thinking how weird like 

272
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:10,104
an online bookstore,
why wouldn't you just go to the 

273
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:13,530
bookstore store where you could see the 
book,

274
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,393
right?
Like,

275
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,340
and all those bookstores shut.
She like,

276
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,230
they closed.
So there's only a few left.

277
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,213
Well,
I know a guy who got a deal with 

278
00:11:23,401 --> 00:11:24,234
Amazon.com to publish a book,
like when Amazon started publishing 

279
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:32,070
books and they blackballed him because 
of this,

280
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:36,900
because he had had a traditional outlet 
deals before and you know,

281
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:39,120
his books would be front and center in 
Barnes,

282
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,840
noble and all those other different 
places.

283
00:11:40,841 --> 00:11:44,080
He's a pretty popular author,
but as soon as you went to Amazon.com,

284
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,590
they're like fuck you.
And they just shut them out.

285
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,470
They shut him out of all those stores.
Yeah.

286
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,510
And I was like,
whoa.

287
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,580
Like there's like a weird book war going
on that I didn't know about.

288
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,850
They're both probably try mean

289
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
those book.
People were trying to keep their 

290
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,270
business model going and thriving,
you know?

291
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:00,640
And he wasn't doing it by threats is 
never the way to go.

292
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,600
Probably not.
No.

293
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,493
I mean the best way to go is when Amazon
publishes a book that people actually 

294
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:08,260
want to buy in your store.
You dumb fuck shirt and your store.

295
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,050
You know what I hate about these?
A super rich guys.

296
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,720
They'll never,
they never in their interviews have like

297
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,100
the only one who will talk like what 
it's like to ball at that level and make

298
00:12:18,101 --> 00:12:18,934
it sound fun.
And like the things you want to ask is 

299
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:22,930
Mark Cuban.
I've seen him in interviews be like,

300
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,033
I got last shit and like knows that.
Like that's a genuine curiosity for 

301
00:12:28,961 --> 00:12:30,250
people.
Like how fun is that?

302
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,410
You have to 7:47.
He's like,

303
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,580
yeah man,
that's pretty cool.

304
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,200
Right?
And he talks about it,

305
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,680
but I saw this interview with gates and 
this guy was asking all those questions.

306
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,513
He was like,
you have to worry about like when 

307
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:42,760
somebody asks you to,
like,

308
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,594
when you ask for something that 
someone's gonna try to ask for more 

309
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,520
because of your known wealth.
He's like,

310
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,580
you know,
my charity really is like,

311
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,670
just like dodging all those questions of
like the fun ship that everyone wants.

312
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,600
He just kept going back to his charity 
and we're like,

313
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,763
we know you're a fucking charitable guy.
Tell us what it's like to own six 

314
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,301
planes,
bro.

315
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:07,930
Like what kind of Shit do you have?
Like Zana do house.

316
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:11,260
It's like 70,000 square feet or 
something.

317
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:12,340
Well,
he's got a house.

318
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:15,690
I think it's on puget sound.
Um,

319
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,640
it's somewhere in the Seattle area.
Medina,

320
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,070
Medina or Medina says that what it is,
I think is what it's called.

321
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,830
It's so freaky.
Look at that.

322
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,650
Looks like using an ad blocker.
What'd he pulled up?

323
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,290
Which pull up 19 crazy facts about his 
house.

324
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:29,830
Oh,
okay.

325
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,663
One hundred $23,000,000.
Disable your ad blocker so we can read 

326
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:35,170
it.
So we,

327
00:13:35,171 --> 00:13:36,004
um,
we were in Seattle and there's this 

328
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,350
thing that's near a bridge,
um,

329
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,513
where you,
you go under this bridge and they have 

330
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,370
this,
uh,

331
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,690
these clear walls where you can see the 
salmon swimming up the salmon ladders,

332
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,740
like they have everything set up with 
these clear like glass walls.

333
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:55,390
So you can watch it.
It's really pretty bad ass.

334
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,620
But the guy who was there who was the,
uh,

335
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,800
you know,
the guide of this thing,

336
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:03,030
who's explaining us how this works in 
which kind of salmon you're looking at,

337
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,000
the whole deal.
He was like,

338
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:06,760
you know,
my uncle worked on the bill.

339
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:07,594
Gurtz almost starts talking about Bill 
Gates' house where Bill Gates House and 

340
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,370
where he lives.
And I remember thinking like,

341
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,413
how weird must've be if you're so rich 
that all everybody wants to do is talk 

342
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:17,831
about like,
Hey,

343
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:20,820
my friend worked on your who's Huh?

344
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,551
And I was like,
well,

345
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:22,384
what's it like?
And he just starts describing skill as 

346
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,114
well.
He has some sort of a submarine access 

347
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,370
and Casey's getting kidnapped.
Like someone's trying to jack them.

348
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,400
They can get in a submarine shoot out 
into the river and I'm like,

349
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,460
what?
Yeah,

350
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:38,320
I don't know how much of that is even 
true because this guy seemed like he was

351
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:43,321
missing a little piece of his brain 
start really adding stuff to it.

352
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,210
I was like,
how much of this is urban myth?

353
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,880
I know that they were reporting even 
like,

354
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,560
I don't know when that house was built 
10,

355
00:14:50,561 --> 00:14:52,070
15 or whatever years ago

356
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,630
that even back then there was shit in 
his house because it was super high tech

357
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,160
of like if you walk in a room,
music would play as you left the room.

358
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:05,160
Music would die down and pick up in the 
next room so that you know,

359
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,090
it had,
which I think you could probably regular

360
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:09,680
person could probably do something like 
that now,

361
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,813
but that was unheard of.
I think you wore a pin him pin on and 

362
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,690
that pen as you walked into different 
rooms,

363
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:22,691
recognize that you were the person so 
you had specific colors that you liked,

364
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,290
so they'd be like backlighting.
That was his kids.

365
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,483
He's big on.
He's the one that started that giving 

366
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:32,144
pledge.
Which is for billionaires to give the 

367
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,593
overwhelming majority of their wealth to
charity so that you don't pass on 

368
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,530
billions to your children.
Right.

369
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,110
You like,
so his thing is like,

370
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm going to leave my kids money but not
like crazy that money.

371
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,281
Which you're like,
yeah,

372
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:49,821
that's,
you know,

373
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:54,821
I totally get the idea behind that.
But also like if you grew up with his,

374
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:58,100
you know,
you're his kid and you're like,

375
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,410
oh there's,
we got lions this year.

376
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,320
And then you're like,
you know,

377
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:06,350
you grow up and you're like,
I'm a photographer now.

378
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,323
Uh,
my dad left me $5,000,000 but like 

379
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,750
$5,000,000 is great.
It's great.

380
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:12,584
But my thing is like,
it's such a step down from what they're 

381
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:16,394
used to.
I feel even remotely bad for some 

382
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,513
fucking kid who gets $5,
million dollars from ms dot don't feel 

383
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:22,544
bad.
What I'm saying is that that adjustment 

384
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,850
has to kick you in the balls.
I mean,

385
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,760
the exposure that they've had,
the lifestyle is like,

386
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,890
it's not,
it's unfathomable to us.

387
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,960
Like we can't even,
it's beyond.

388
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,870
They're just like a.
it's like being the prince,

389
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,210
you know,
it's like your dad's assaulting a Brunei

390
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,610
and then he's like,
well go fuck him.

391
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,630
I mean,
they're probably,

392
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:43,190
well just that.
I don't know why I assumed that,

393
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:44,690
but I think that like,
uh,

394
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,583
he and his wife seem like such 
reasonable people that I bet they've 

395
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,930
prepared them for,
for,

396
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,230
for what's coming while they've got to 
figure out a way to make it on their own

397
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:56,750
and how do you get a kid to do that?
That's tough,

398
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:57,620
right?
You know,

399
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,390
how do you get a kid to do that?
Who's,

400
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,570
who's grown up like that?
Yeah.

401
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,643
I don't think about that with your kid.
Like as you're starting to ball out of 

402
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,960
control.
Yeah,

403
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,610
I think about it for sure.
Like,

404
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:08,444
um,
how do you,

405
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,090
and then like had to not,
you know,

406
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,390
you want to prepare your kid for that 
and then how does,

407
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:15,980
how will a boy,
I don't know,

408
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:20,690
maybe especially a boy's aligned with 
their dads usually in a certain way,

409
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,583
you know,
like kid compares himself to you and 

410
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:26,720
your success,
but you don't want them to feel like,

411
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,610
uh,
you know,

412
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,280
he's less than in your shadow.
Sure.

413
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,260
Especially like,
what if he goes into comedy.

414
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,710
Oh my God.
Have you thought about if your daughters

415
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:39,860
were to go with my seven year old's 
hilarious.

416
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,220
She's really funny.
Does she ever like,

417
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,320
uh,
I'm sure she like,

418
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,250
does she know what the fuck comedy is?
No,

419
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,650
she just knows how to be silly and she's
seen me on TV doing it.

420
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,400
Not

421
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,220
really,
no.

422
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,000
She flipped through Netflix and makes 
fun of me.

423
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,780
Really?
She's,

424
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,940
yeah.
Yeah.

425
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,680
Nice jeans.
Dad starts mocking me.

426
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,870
Really?
Yeah.

427
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,200
She's just ruthlessly funny.
She goes after a seven year old.

428
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,370
Is the younger.
Yeah,

429
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,000
she goes after it all the time,
going after jokes.

430
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,240
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

431
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,000
She's just,
she's really funny.

432
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,390
But I see her becoming like a youtube 
character or something.

433
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,303
Well,
how do you,

434
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,520
what do you think about as far as like 
them not feeling,

435
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,020
you know,
overwhelmed by your success or status?

436
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,100
Do you ever think about that?

437
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,110
I think it's less likely because they're
girls,

438
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,620
you know,
but um,

439
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,700
I was actually having a conversation 
with Neil Brennan about this last night.

440
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:33,380
We were talking about another famous 
guy,

441
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,020
I don't know him that well,
so I won't use his name,

442
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:41,021
but he has a Tucson's and uh,
at least one daughter.

443
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,000
The daughter is highly motivated.
He's not worried about it at all.

444
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:45,680
She kicks ass in school.
She's awesome.

445
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,843
The sons are fucking insanely lazy and 
they just sit around and they know that 

446
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:50,594
when they turn 26,
they get a giant check and they're 25 

447
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:59,060
now and boy they don't do shit.
And he's civil super worried about it.

448
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,800
I wouldn't be able to do,

449
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:01,870
you know,
that's a,

450
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:04,480
that's a,
that's like a nightmare man.

451
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,220
Well,
it's like,

452
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,810
it's so hard to actually do something if
you don't have to.

453
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,590
It's so hard to,
to make something happen in your life,

454
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,930
right?
To start a business,

455
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,320
to enter into a career and become 
successful at it,

456
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,163
to really focus and try to get good to 
the point where you're successful at 

457
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,100
something.
You have to have a fire inside of you.

458
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:26,934
You have to have a need to achieve.
And if you already have a Ferrari and 

459
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:31,074
you're already living in a mansion,
you already have $10,000,000 in the 

460
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,900
bank.
You already have all your bills paid.

461
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:37,734
You don't have to get up in the morning 
if you don't want to get the idea of 

462
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,963
just becoming this discipline machine 
out there to try to kick ass in this 

463
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:48,720
life and be self actualized.
So hard,

464
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,310
so hard to pull off.

465
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,810
You got to like dial back to on the 
spoiling.

466
00:19:53,811 --> 00:19:58,811
I think I went to high school with a 
grand son of a billionaire and they were

467
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:02,960
very present in the area,
you know,

468
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,880
and uh,
you know,

469
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:06,680
they drove,
used cars,

470
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,993
the grandkids I'm saying and had 
obviously they could have gotten way 

471
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,910
more,
but it was like instilling this.

472
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,270
You're not just going to coast through 
everything and they got jobs and uh,

473
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,260
as far as I know about now,
what he's doing now is like,

474
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,340
he's working,
he's really working,

475
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,400
even though he's gonna inherit like just
crazy amounts of money,

476
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,690
you know,
but I mean,

477
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:32,900
part of it too is just the nature of 
that person.

478
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,470
I think you can try to not go crazy with
um,

479
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,053
you know,
taking care of them gifts and all that 

480
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:40,094
stuff.
But some of that drive has to come from 

481
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:45,170
within no matter what your socioeconomic
level is.

482
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,290
Yeah,
I would imagine some of it.

483
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,340
I think there's people that are grow up 
rich that it doesn't matter.

484
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:52,600
It doesn't matter.
They're just,

485
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,550
they're going to succeed.
They love it.

486
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,310
They like succeeding.
They like working hard.

487
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:58,144
They like getting things done within.
There's like what causes a kid to be a 

488
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:03,490
lazy fuck,
you know,

489
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:04,324
like you come home,
the kids on the couch just with their 

490
00:21:05,591 --> 00:21:08,590
feet up and they don't do what I asked 
you to do.

491
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,800
I was gonna yeah.
But something happened.

492
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,783
Mike called and fucking.
I know people like cars and gas and I 

493
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:17,770
think there's something wrong with just,
I mean,

494
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:21,340
I know people like that who you want to 
shake the fuck is wrong with you,

495
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:23,500
but they,
I think a lot of times they just,

496
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,510
it's almost like they fear doing the 
thing.

497
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,790
They're scared,
they're scared.

498
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,500
What if I do something and I suck at it,
you know,

499
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,480
that kind of thing.
There's definitely that.

500
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,940
There's,
will you see that in a lot of,

501
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,060
um,
like

502
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,050
amateur comics that are sort of starting
to make it into comedy?

503
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,340
Yeah.
You see like a lot of like sabotage.

504
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,203
Do you know that stress of you're just 
doing open mic nights and then all of a 

505
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:49,194
sudden you starting to get paid and then
some people start moving forward and 

506
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:54,080
other people get left behind.
I remember,

507
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,610
remember those days,
of course I remember thinking like,

508
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,061
man,
boy,

509
00:21:57,061 --> 00:21:59,610
there's a lot of people here that are 
sabotaging themselves.

510
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,473
Oh yeah.
See the stress of [inaudible] stand up 

511
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:04,584
in particular,
so open ended like you could make of it 

512
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:09,060
what you want.
You put in as much as you want.

513
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,830
You either can be successful or not 
depending upon how much you focus on it,

514
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,693
how much talent you have,
how much drive and discipline you have 

515
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,160
in a couple of breaks,
a couple breaks.

516
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,003
There's a bunch,
bunch of factors and sometimes those 

517
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:22,794
factors are just too overwhelming to 
some people and see them just start 

518
00:22:25,741 --> 00:22:26,574
tanking it.
They're drinking at the store every 

519
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:28,081
night.
Yeah,

520
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:28,630
yeah,

521
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,920
yeah.
Because it's scary.

522
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,780
The truth is that it's scary.
Yeah.

523
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,730
I remember when people handle it 
different ways.

524
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:35,080
Like I remember the people who'd be 
like,

525
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,980
they would just say like,
this is a,

526
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,680
you know,
this isn't going to work out.

527
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,890
Like I don't know why we're doing this.
Oh yeah.

528
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:44,080
Those people.
And I always was always like,

529
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,780
dude,
don't talk to me anymore.

530
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,730
You don't want to hear.
Yeah,

531
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:49,603
you're fucking so negative.
But they do in that just to sort of 

532
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:55,530
eliminate that pain of failing.
Yeah.

533
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,590
You know,
just trying to like,

534
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,240
just address it now.
Eh,

535
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,850
come on,
we're just normal guys.

536
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,090
Never going to happen.
Never going to.

537
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,120
And I will just get a fucking regular 
job,

538
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,600
will be working for Amazon or something.
And you're like,

539
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:09,220
what are you talking about,
man?

540
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,570
Yeah.
There's people who are like,

541
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:11,404
yeah,
this doesn't know he can't make any 

542
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:13,270
money doing this.

543
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,430
I remember that a lot too.
It's like you can't make any money doing

544
00:23:15,431 --> 00:23:16,630
this.
I was like,

545
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,310
Whoa,
you can't make any money right now.

546
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,840
It doesn't mean you're not going to make
money later.

547
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,450
And they're like,
how are you going to get to later?

548
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,800
Because there's no money now.
I'm like,

549
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,510
you know,
it's almost this weird.

550
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,150
Do you remember the development deal 
years?

551
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:30,790
Were you around during the development 
deal in detail?

552
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:32,740
And I was at the where they were like,
they were like,

553
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,603
ah,
two years ago you would make $600,000 

554
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:35,914
for that same Jesus Christ.
I was there for the development deal 

555
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:43,630
years,
but I kind of was working during.

556
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,464
Most of it was during most of it.
I was doing news radio when it got 

557
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,013
really hot,
I was doing news news radio and I 

558
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:53,270
remember that there were comics that 
would go to Montreal.

559
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,313
They would do the comedy festival,
they would have these sets and they 

560
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:01,130
would come back and they had half a 
million dollar deals and they were,

561
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:01,964
there was sitcoms and they were 
convinced that it was all fucking 

562
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:05,504
happening for them and I remember I had 
quite more than one conversation with 

563
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:10,424
one of these people that we're trying to
put me on their show comics that have 

564
00:24:13,101 --> 00:24:17,770
never worked since,
like do not hear from them bro.

565
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,440
My shows guaranteed is what's going to 
happen.

566
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,020
It's guaranteed go to air.
It doesn't go there.

567
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:23,923
There's a million dollar backup deal.
Like they had all this stuff that they 

568
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,654
were telling you about,
like they went the opposite way instead 

569
00:24:28,971 --> 00:24:32,920
of like being like terrified of the 
future to the point where they were just

570
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,973
letting themselves off the hook.
They were super confident in this weird 

571
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:40,250
delusional.
It's definitely happened for me thing.

572
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,660
Odd Man.
Yeah.

573
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,280
It's odd to subscribe.
I see.

574
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,290
That would always scare me because I'm 
more.

575
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:46,423
My,
my just more life perspective is like 

576
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,120
you don't,
you don't react until the check clears.

577
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,980
Yeah.
Right.

578
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,610
And every.
Yeah.

579
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,320
I don't go like that's definitely 
happening.

580
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,370
No,
it's always like wait and see.

581
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:01,340
Well those people that.
It was interesting because they.

582
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,260
None of them made it.
Yeah.

583
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,660
None of them and they were all 
convinced,

584
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,950
but it was a weird convinced.
It was like if you what?

585
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,540
You're not even that good.
That's what I wanted to tell him.

586
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,190
Like you got lucky man.
You had a pretty.

587
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:17,024
You're Kinda cute.
He had a pretty decent set in front of 

588
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:20,654
a,
a very willing crowd and someone took a 

589
00:25:23,091 --> 00:25:26,930
chance on you because people are.
There was a nutty time.

590
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:27,764
I guess we should describe it to people.
There was a nutty time where they were 

591
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,364
just chucking around development deals 
like a regular person who probably had 

592
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:35,390
no business being on stage.

593
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,090
You get $100,000 development deal.
Yeah,

594
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,680
we,
I literally just missed that.

595
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:44,180
I think they said that the last big one 
that they talked about was like,

596
00:25:44,181 --> 00:25:45,440
oh five.
They're like,

597
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:49,310
that was one of the last big six figure 
development deals,

598
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:52,550
which is basically you go to Montreal,
which is the just for laughs.

599
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,620
Big Festival.
All the executives go,

600
00:25:54,621 --> 00:25:56,780
they all basically party for a week.
Yeah.

601
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:00,080
It was like an excuse to do work and 
then,

602
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,173
you know,
they were signing people up with those 

603
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:02,864
checks and we literally,
I went in the o seven new faces class 

604
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,880
and they're like,
uh,

605
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,743
two years ago someone got,
I got $850,000 for his 15 minutes at 

606
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,343
850.
One of the big last big ones that 

607
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,440
failed.
They had a record.

608
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,950
There was like a tallying of like this 
person,

609
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:22,761
this person,
this person,

610
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:25,340
this person all got them and nothing 
came of it.

611
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,383
And then went all in and Oh,
five on a couple of other people and 

612
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:31,100
then that didn't pan out some.
So they're like,

613
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,470
fuck these development deals man.
Now it's done.

614
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,371
No,
never.

615
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:35,750
It never happens.
Now you know,

616
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,040
you never hear about them.
No.

617
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,830
I got one in 93.
I got a development deal.

618
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,980
Ninety three.
Wow.

619
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,213
Yeah.

620
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,040
One of the first ones are just just for 
the festival.

621
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,210
Wow.
Yeah.

622
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:51,210
I went to the festival with a deal.
That's crazy.

623
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,800
Yeah.
I had a deal with Disney.

624
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,240
Yeah.
Now they,

625
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,093
that shit never happens.
It was the weirdest thing in the world 

626
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,840
because it was,
I went from being fucking broke,

627
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,180
like,
oh,

628
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,840
I'm making $300 this weekend if I go to 
this place and do a set on Friday night.

629
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,160
Yeah.
And then,

630
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:09,000
uh,
you know,

631
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,650
you got six figures.
Yeah.

632
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,940
Did you think,
were you like,

633
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:12,803
this is crazy right now?
I got 100 the first time and then there 

634
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:19,500
was a second part of it where I got 50.
It was just like,

635
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,870
what?
I was eating lobster every night.

636
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,570
Then you say that your accountant 
manager,

637
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,590
he thought I had a gambling problem.
So funny.

638
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,390
It's like,
nope,

639
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,980
just kidding.
Yeah.

640
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,010
And he was like,
what?

641
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,990
How are you spending so much money?
I was like,

642
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,790
I'm just spending money.
Like,

643
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,200
this is how I'm going to live from now 
on.

644
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,041
Yeah.
He's like,

645
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,050
that is the stupidest fucking thing I've
ever heard in my life.

646
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,810
Why I was right.
Yeah,

647
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,190
because I was right.
Yeah,

648
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,560
you're right.
It just took a chance.

649
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:47,760
Yeah.
That's so cool.

650
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,530
It could have turned out terribly wrong,
but the,

651
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,513
the thing that was weird about it,
that was the most incredible thing was 

652
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:57,840
that once I started working and wants 
the money,

653
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,703
the check came in and um,
I didn't have to think about my bills 

654
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:06,210
anymore.
There was a physical feeling of relief,

655
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,530
like a physical feeling of relief.
Yeah.

656
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,313
To go from being broke and have no idea 
how you're going to pay your bills and 

657
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:14,754
just trying to hustle up $100 sad or a 
$75 set somewhere to go from that to 

658
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,140
just not having to worry about money.

659
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,230
Yeah.
Instantaneously instantaneously,

660
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,700
you know,
after taxes,

661
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:27,534
having x amount of dollars in the bank 
and just go on and what that's in the 

662
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,120
bank.
Yeah,

663
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,610
that's crazy.
I know.

664
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,210
But then the feeling like a lightness of
being like,

665
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,660
like I felt physically lighter,
like it's so much of your life,

666
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:44,370
it consumes you for so much of your life
is like.

667
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,170
And there's this bill and then there's 
that bill.

668
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:47,580
It's like it's on your mind all the 
time.

669
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,610
Yeah.
You know,

670
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,970
like shit.
And I got no,

671
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:51,804
I got these weeks of work lined up,
but then that other thing is going to 

672
00:28:54,351 --> 00:28:55,184
come up so I better not,
I need to call it because it's all you 

673
00:28:57,091 --> 00:28:59,310
think about,
but I think it goes the other way too.

674
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,670
I think that when you get to like this 
Jeff Bezos level,

675
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,923
I think then all of a sudden it's a 
burden because I feel like there isn't 

676
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:07,740
the lightness.

677
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,880
The lightness is like Brian Cowen had a 
saying once and I've repeated it a bunch

678
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:12,714
of time because I think he nailed it.
He said you want to get rich enough so 

679
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:16,164
that you don't have to worry about your 
bills and you don't have to worry about 

680
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:20,670
how much things cost when you go to eat 
at a restaurant.

681
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,530
Yeah,
that's great.

682
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,190
It was everything else after that is 
bullshit.

683
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,870
That's true.
That's true.

684
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

685
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,540
All that other stuff like acquiring 
stuff and jewelry and shit like that,

686
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,390
like dealing with all that.
No,

687
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:34,290
you're right.
And it's like,

688
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,363
um,
there's that thing too when like when 

689
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,830
you have enough money to go to 
restaurants and sometimes you'll go to a

690
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:41,980
and they'll like and the

691
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,813
special is a this cut of meat and 
there's a lobster on the side and it's 

692
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,370
69,
95 and you're like,

693
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,483
not a problem.
I always feel like it's weird when I 

694
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:55,150
tell you the price,
I know you're like,

695
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,310
what the fuck is going to embarrass me 
here at the table?

696
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,790
I'm good.
But instead it's an odd thing.

697
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,410
Like sometimes they tell you the price 
and sometimes they don't.

698
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,340
Sometimes they just tell you the special
we have a rack of lamb.

699
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,310
That sounds good.
Nice restaurants.

700
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,840
A lot of times there's multiple items.
It just says market price.

701
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,010
Yeah,
that's a weird one.

702
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,330
And you can just be like,
I want that.

703
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,590
And they're like,
you said.

704
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:19,210
So they just bring it to you.
Like that's $400.

705
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,440
Like what?
Yeah,

706
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:22,420
what kind of market is this?
This is crazy,

707
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,200
but don't you think that if you get to 
the point where you're worth $105,

708
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:29,620
billion dollars just to focus on you 
alone,

709
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,430
it's a lot.

710
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,690
Yeah.
It must be overwhelming.

711
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,653
It must be overwhelming.
And also to the Bill Gates thing is 

712
00:30:35,351 --> 00:30:36,184
like,
it is the thing that everybody probably 

713
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:42,970
wants to ask you talk about.
Oh yeah.

714
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,630
It's like everyone knows you have a 15 
inch Dick and then let me see,

715
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,733
just let me see it.
Can I touch it tastes like a regular 

716
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:53,930
Dick.
Like his limp and shifting and just.

717
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,500
It's crazy.
It's like knowing that about someone.

718
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,030
It's all everyone.
So yeah,

719
00:30:58,031 --> 00:30:58,864
I think that energy,
you feel that everyone's like you're 

720
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,910
super rich because we're all fascinated,
especially in this country with,

721
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,470
you know,
accumulating wealth.

722
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,910
It's like,
I feel like it's.

723
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,280
I feel like it's heightened here.
Yeah,

724
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:10,600
for sure.
Well,

725
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,420
I mean think about how much of the 
culture is about balling.

726
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,290
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

727
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,123
It's all about young entertainment.
Culture is all about diamonds and 

728
00:31:19,721 --> 00:31:20,660
stepping out of role.

729
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
I saw this dude,
I don't know his name.

730
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:28,320
They showed him getting a jewelry that 
he bought and you saw that and it has an

731
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:29,403
emblem with the 69 and it spins and he's
got like diamond teeth and then he had 

732
00:31:33,941 --> 00:31:36,340
like,
he had like 200 grand in his waistband.

733
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,300
He just took it out and was like,
ah,

734
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,640
stacking the money.
It's just like,

735
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,560
it's a fascination with like,
look how much shit I have,

736
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,753
all this shit I can buy.
Like that's part of the culture now and 

737
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,510
going on for a long time.
It has been coming up from poverty.

738
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:51,160
That's what it is.
It's the,

739
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,180
the idea is that these guys were all 
like super poor and then they made it in

740
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,220
here.
This is what happens when you make it.

741
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,130
It's kind of,
you know what it's kind of also,

742
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:01,810
uh,
we see that in like hip hop a lot here,

743
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,140
but it's also what you saw with a major 
drug traffickers.

744
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,230
They all come from extreme poverty.
All of them.

745
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,760
Uh,
El Chapo,

746
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,380
Pablo Escobar,
super,

747
00:32:11,381 --> 00:32:12,610
super,
super poor.

748
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,610
And they accumulate in crazy amounts of 
wealth.

749
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,380
And then they're like,
look at all my shit.

750
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,440
You know,
it's like you see this,

751
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,280
like the parallel.
It's the same thing.

752
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,530
Yeah.
Like when Pablo Escobar,

753
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,200
oh my God,
when he had the hippos and shit.

754
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,080
Fucking zoo.
Yeah,

755
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:34,380
he had when he built his prison time,
but I'm building it and there was soccer

756
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:38,680
fields and then he would fly in national
players like play soccer with me today.

757
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,891
And they're like,
okay.

758
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,300
And even after all that,
he was like,

759
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:42,610
Nah,
I don't want to speak anymore.

760
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,810
I'm going to get out of here.
And we'll even.

761
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,280
Yeah,
somebody else built his own prison.

762
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,220
Columbia,
they had parties.

763
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,880
Joey Diaz got me on this show because I 
watched narcos,

764
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:54,380
which is a great netflix series.

765
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,740
And then there's another series called 
surviving Escobar.

766
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,963
And it's,
it,

767
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,480
it follows a escobar had a right hand 
man,

768
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,490
uh,
his right hand.

769
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Hitman killed like 300 people for him 
named John Heidel of Alaska is baskets.

770
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,013
And if follows him from like the day 
they got Escobar and this guy turned 

771
00:33:17,601 --> 00:33:18,434
himself in and it shows him in prison 
and how he just ended up starting 

772
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,420
another cartel from basic,
from within prison.

773
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,670
And it's a fascinating series.
Yeah,

774
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,100
that's it.
And this is a new netflix pressure.

775
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,650
I think what happened was that I feel 
like it was a.

776
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,000
seems like it was a Colombian series 
that they acquired,

777
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:39,050
is what it seems like.
I'm not sure,

778
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,850
but it's really good.
I mean,

779
00:33:40,851 --> 00:33:42,170
it's,
it's all in Spanish,

780
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,580
uh,
with subtitles.

781
00:33:43,581 --> 00:33:45,360
But it's,
that's the real guy on,

782
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,690
in that picture right there.
Is that guy still alive?

783
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,220
Yeah.
His nickname is popeye.

784
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,320
And uh,
he,

785
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:51,830
yeah,
he,

786
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:52,663
he fucking murdered so many people and 
they had such a dedication to their 

787
00:33:57,531 --> 00:33:58,364
bosses.
That's one of the things they followed 

788
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:00,950
them,
like religious leaders,

789
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,630
you know,
like if he's in an interview Popeye,

790
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,473
this guy saying,
if Pablo Escobar had told me to kill my 

791
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:09,890
dad,
I would have done it.

792
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,393
What?
Like I wouldn't have hesitated either 

793
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:17,840
that they have such devotion to the boss
really was a dick.

794
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,940
Maybe it was like,
yeah,

795
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,590
my dad was a big asphalt.
So yeah,

796
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,510
of course I killed.
There's that movie that's coming out now

797
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,040
about,
um,

798
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,900
the,
the uh,

799
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:30,763
the lady from cocaine cowboys.
The fuckers are now resell to Blanca 

800
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,761
cell.
Done.

801
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,560
Yeah.
We have Jennifer Lopez.

802
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,830
No,
it's Catherine Zeta Jones.

803
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:38,664
Oh,
that's right.

804
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,790
And she actually made her like,
not as hot.

805
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,771
Really?
Yeah.

806
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,430
I mean she,
she's like 80 now.

807
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,890
That's just 150 years old.
She weighs 6:50.

808
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:50,080
Like Bert.
Yeah,

809
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,220
we took pictures a picture before we 
went to the game together.

810
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,760
[inaudible] posed together.
Right.

811
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,703
I have a tee shirt on.
Bert has like a Hoodie like this with 

812
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:07,580
pockets and then a jersey over it.
So it just looks so much everybody.

813
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,533
Everybody was like,
Jesus Christ Bergs you put on 400 that 

814
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,380
picture because he,
he has like six layers on photo.

815
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:18,170
It was all.
They were all pretty slim there though.

816
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,290
Are we got fat for awhile?
He.

817
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:21,881
Yeah.
Yeah.

818
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:24,470
I already got into a serious.
A candy.

819
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,570
A addiction.
Oh quite a bit.

820
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,240
Uhm,
which is fucking terrible for you.

821
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:33,200
That sugar fat.
Just getting fat from nothing but sugar.

822
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,780
But he just decided to cut it out as the
weight.

823
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:36,610
Yeah.
I look good.

824
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,550
We look.
That was a long time ago though,

825
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,170
but the way he did it was pretty 
interesting.

826
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,033
Just said,
ah,

827
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,290
I don't want to be fat anymore.
That's a good way to do it.

828
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,750
Didn't join weight watchers,
didn't do anything.

829
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,870
Here's a body that responds to that 
pretty well too though.

830
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,670
You know,
like I feel like there's different.

831
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,643
There's definitely different body types 
and he's the kind that could probably 

832
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,390
make a slight adjustment and see things 
sway.

833
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,030
Well,
I guarantee with burdens,

834
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:02,160
booze,
if burt just cut off the booze,

835
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,070
I mean he would lose a massive amount of
weight.

836
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,770
He goes so hard.
He goes so hard.

837
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,060
It's,
it's bizarre.

838
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,010
Yeah.
Now he goes hard,

839
00:36:11,011 --> 00:36:11,844
man.
To the point where I was really stunned 

840
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,980
that he made it through sober October.
I was stunned.

841
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,590
I think he really responds to challenges
he likes.

842
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:22,610
He likes,
he likes to challenge because he,

843
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,040
you know,
he,

844
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,890
we always joke how he speaks in 
hyperbole and he's always just like,

845
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,753
yeah,
like if you go like I bet you can do 

846
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,850
like definitely could to do that.
It's always immediate.

847
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,310
Yes.
Without consideration of it.

848
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,660
He's like,
I can definitely do that.

849
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,573
Yeah.
Now already said when we were hanging 

850
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:36,504
this weekend because I was like,
I'm definitely doing definitely doing 

851
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:43,000
the La Marathon and I think it's in 
April and he's like,

852
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,780
if you do that I will show up in roller 
skates.

853
00:36:45,781 --> 00:36:47,100
I will fucking kill you.

854
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,630
And like there's no way.
There's just no way.

855
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:53,280
And we were like,
what are you talking about?

856
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,720
Like you can casually rollerskate a five
minute mile casually.

857
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,210
Not even close.
No sweating.

858
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,220
No.
And he's like after,

859
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,600
after when your feet hurt.
So it just push through it.

860
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,493
Like why,
why do you think you can push through 

861
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:12,600
something and somebody else can't.
We'll just fucking push through.

862
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:14,490
It will beat you.
I was like,

863
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,960
I'll go take a nap and get back and then
still be cute.

864
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,620
Was like,
no,

865
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:22,140
definitely definitely be used.
Well he ran a half marathon.

866
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,450
He did and he did surprisingly well.
I didn't think he would do that.

867
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:25,960
How long did it take them to run a half 
marathon?

868
00:37:25,961 --> 00:37:29,550
One to say it was like the 2:40,
something like that.

869
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,413
Right?
Something like that.

870
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,900
Maybe to 35 to 45,
something that.

871
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,790
Is that a clean split like can you say,
oh,

872
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,590
that means that you would do a five hour
marathon?

873
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,590
I don't necessarily lower.
You'd be slower.

874
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,650
You get tired.
Yeah.

875
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,663
That second half and everyone that I've 
talked to said especially that last 

876
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,930
stretch,
like the last five miles are supposed to

877
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:51,360
be the most taxing,
you know?

878
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,051
Yeah.
I mean,

879
00:37:52,051 --> 00:37:52,884
mom,
my friend campaigns is running a 

880
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:54,740
marathon.
It's really,

881
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,800
really crazy.
Really crazy psychopath.

882
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,100
I know.
And you watch him,

883
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,380
you know,
I pull up his instagram and I'm like,

884
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,410
just fucking positive man.
Just do it.

885
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,840
He's getting up every morning before 
work has a regular job.

886
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:09,480
Is running fucking miles and miles at 
six in the morning.

887
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,213
And I heard her say the only thing that 
made him seem human was him talking 

888
00:38:14,881 --> 00:38:17,970
about there was a time when he said it 
was hard to run a mile or something.

889
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,841
He was like,
yeah,

890
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,120
I remember when it was hard to run a 
mile.

891
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,680
I'm like,
seriously?

892
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,540
You had trouble running a mile?
Yeah.

893
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,030
When he first started running like 
everybody else,

894
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,500
running is a weird thing,
man.

895
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,520
They been doing it a lot more.
Yeah,

896
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,150
but when I do it now too,
it's a.

897
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:35,890
I'm kind of amazed.
I think back at like where it used to be

898
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:36,490
difficult

899
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,440
and it's not difficult there anymore.
I'm like,

900
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,274
well,
how come it's not?

901
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,710
It's almost like your brain's like,
well what happened?

902
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:42,610
Like,
what changed?

903
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,803
How come I can just run up this section 
now and hustled through here and push 

904
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,123
through around this corner and get up to
that Ridge and go over the top and then 

905
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:52,240
to the top and that's where I stopped 
now.

906
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,380
Why did I get so much further?
Yeah,

907
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,860
you brought your.
Your body does.

908
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,933
It's almost like your brain doesn't want
to believe that your body can get in 

909
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,360
better shape.
Like you know,

910
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:02,590
you can,
you know,

911
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:03,424
like when I work out and have worked out
for a long time and I'm fit and I'll do 

912
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:08,620
like rounds in the bag or something like
that.

913
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:11,080
I'll know I'm not getting as tired as 
they used to be,

914
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:12,110
but I don't want to believe it.

915
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,740
That is weird why your body is your 
brain is.

916
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,100
It's like trying to keep you from 
progressing in a way.

917
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,920
I don't know.
It's like your brain has memories of the

918
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,813
Times where you were getting tired doing
stuff that you're not getting tired 

919
00:39:24,681 --> 00:39:26,020
anymore.
Confused.

920
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,590
Like what's happening here?
I've been doing,

921
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:32,600
I hired a trainer and a part of our 
workouts has been bike sprints,

922
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,020
like stationary bike sprints.
Fuck men.

923
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:39,410
Do you get an airdyne sprint or do you 
do just like a regular bike sprint?

924
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,600
Um,
I mean it's a stationary bike,

925
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,360
right?
So I don't know what type of bike it is,

926
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,493
but it's like,
it'll be like a max out 32nd sprint and 

927
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:49,184
recovery.
I've never felt as close to dying 

928
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,030
really.
How it's like,

929
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,980
I mean,
especially on like the third sprint,

930
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,210
it's like,
you know,

931
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,320
lungs,
heart,

932
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,550
quads are just like,
I,

933
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,403
I,
I have a whole new respect just for 

934
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:06,500
cyclists,
just doing those fucking stupid sprints.

935
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,460
I do.
It's just,

936
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,050
it's so taxing.
You know,

937
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,340
it just.
Where'd you get this guy?

938
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,570
I found him just searching and I met him
and then uh,

939
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,480
started doing where he's just been given
me like a one on one and I've been doing

940
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,483
is just mixing it up so like we'll have 
like strength phase where it's like 

941
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,630
power days,
you know,

942
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,473
like higher weight,
lower reps and then he'll throw in core 

943
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:31,970
stuff and then we'll do high rep days.
I like the mixing it up.

944
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,380
I guess I get bored,
you know,

945
00:40:33,381 --> 00:40:34,214
and of course it's been fun to like work
out with somebody who mean he knows his 

946
00:40:38,781 --> 00:40:41,030
shit and has been like super 
challenging.

947
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,890
What's his name?
You want to know his name?

948
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:44,490
Just give me his first name.
Uh,

949
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,510
there's two dudes.
Two different guys do different guys.

950
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,560
You go to two different guys.

951
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,360
You have two trainers.
I got three extra.

952
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:52,580
Hashtag Paulin.
I guess what I'm talking about again,

953
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,330
how your kids can relate to you.
Man.

954
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:56,710
The Guy had three trainers,
dad's on tinkers.

955
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,110
Daddy's got a six pack.
I got,

956
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,290
I got a trainer,
I got Micah,

957
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,360
Shawn and Kelly.
So how do you mix it up?

958
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:04,120
Why do you go to three different people?
Um,

959
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,490
as you can?
Yeah.

960
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:07,120
Just to make it challenging.
Different.

961
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,080
Yeah.
Just to do different shit.

962
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:10,243
Really.
This the truth.

963
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,273
Real.
Yeah.

964
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,553
Just to do different shit because I know
that I'm going to get something 

965
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:15,074
different out of them on different days.
And how many times a week you work it 

966
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:18,734
out.
Now if you've got three different 

967
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:20,900
trainers,
you must be hitting them at least once a

968
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:21,734
week.
Each guy I'm doing like three or four 

969
00:41:22,821 --> 00:41:24,250
days a week.
Yeah.

970
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,800
Tommy bonds can shape [inaudible] I'm 
super strong,

971
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:28,521
man.
Yeah.

972
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:29,354
I don't know why,
but it just happened because your 

973
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:31,424
family's.
Yeah.

974
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,910
Recognize me.
Here's one picture.

975
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,200
He was a real pleasure to her shirts on.
Girl Goes,

976
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:45,930
oh my friend that works here at this bar
is a big fan of yours to burt.

977
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,290
We used sign the back of this to her.
He was like,

978
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,090
how about a video?
And,

979
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,450
and then she goes,
okay,

980
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,340
take shirt off in a black cigar bar in 
Atlanta.

981
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,260
Okay.
And like everybody.

982
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:05,050
Yes.
And then he takes the camera and he goes

983
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:06,280
like up his stomach.

984
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,740
Fuck.
But of course she was like,

985
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,560
that's fucking awesome.
Of course she lost her mother.

986
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,220
Of course him and I saw this,
like,

987
00:42:20,221 --> 00:42:21,900
what happened here?
Dude?

988
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:24,210
He just,
he's a.

989
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,560
we're buying booze and nobody was 
dancing.

990
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,130
Oh yeah.
Just him.

991
00:42:32,131 --> 00:42:33,540
He got the vibe going,
man,

992
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,580
I'm telling you,
this is natural element.

993
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:40,581
He's also about 19 drinks in 19 boy.
He looks hammered.

994
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,320
I mean that whole,
that whole store was dancing with him.

995
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,210
People walked in and knew him or he's 
drunk to look at art dancing.

996
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,940
He dances like the widest phish fan 
ever.

997
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,803
That's so true.
It's like jumping up and down with his 

998
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:02,520
legs together.
These guys knew him.

999
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,160
Yeah,
it was.

1000
00:43:05,161 --> 00:43:06,570
He was in.
He was in heaven,

1001
00:43:06,571 --> 00:43:07,840
man.
Boy.

1002
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,693
What a.
What a weird life that Bert Kreischer 

1003
00:43:10,741 --> 00:43:12,690
lives.
So he's really as the party guy.

1004
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,160
Oh yeah.
Just the machine.

1005
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,720
I think for awhile I was like,
that's your act like I'm your friend,

1006
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,410
but that's your act.
And then I hung up hanging out.

1007
00:43:22,411 --> 00:43:23,550
You're like,
that's really who you are,

1008
00:43:23,551 --> 00:43:25,170
man.
You really the party guy.

1009
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,270
He enjoys it.
Yeah.

1010
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,320
But it's so rough on your body.
I don't know,

1011
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,450
he pushes through man.
It's amazing.

1012
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:36,030
He gets up the next day and was like,
he'll be like,

1013
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,170
I'm really feeling it.
But you're like,

1014
00:43:37,171 --> 00:43:39,230
you don't notice,
you know,

1015
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,910
you know what I did when we went out to 
breakfast on,

1016
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:43,740
um,
what was it Monday?

1017
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,480
I think it was Monday.
Yeah,

1018
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,110
we went to breakfast the day of the game
and uh,

1019
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,890
my friend Justin lives in Atlanta,
it comes over,

1020
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,010
picks us up and he's like,
oh,

1021
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,740
first feeling more than we sit down at 
this breakfast place,

1022
00:43:59,130 --> 00:43:59,963
coffees,
and we ordered breakfast and he orders 

1023
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:05,070
eggs and toast and bacon or something.

1024
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,630
And then he's like,
all right.

1025
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,700
And then as the waitress walks go,
oh,

1026
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,050
could you send them a waffle also?
Um,

1027
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,300
like in front of him,
you know,

1028
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:13,350
and he's like,
what?

1029
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,080
And I go,
you like waffles?

1030
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:15,781
And he's like,
yeah,

1031
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:19,970
that's true.
So she's like this massive,

1032
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,090
awful.
He was like,

1033
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:25,860
this was a really good decision.
It's totally tearing it up.

1034
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,210
Scarfing.
Yeah.

1035
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,140
I know he wants to do another challenge.
He was talking about doing something.

1036
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:35,610
He keeps bringing things up and makes 
these videos already threw one at us.

1037
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,630
Yeah,
yeah.

1038
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:39,780
Which I think actually would probably,
again,

1039
00:44:39,781 --> 00:44:42,360
it's something that would benefit him 
the most,

1040
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:44,130
but other people will get benefits from 
it too.

1041
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,240
Was the go phone free social media free 
for a month?

1042
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,380
Oh,
that's Ari.

1043
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,900
Ari does that all the time.
All the time.

1044
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,510
That's like me asking you guys to do 
Jujitsu.

1045
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,320
Yeah.
No,

1046
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,153
but I think like I,
I respected the challenge in terms of 

1047
00:44:59,341 --> 00:44:59,671
like,
yeah,

1048
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:02,020
I do look at that shit too much.
I do it,

1049
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,330
you know,
it takes,

1050
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,990
it takes too much of your focus away,
which like already talked about.

1051
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:08,310
And then of course where it was like 
easy,

1052
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,900
like it's not easy for you.
You're on it.

1053
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,210
He brings his charger with him when we 
go.

1054
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,650
When we went out I was like,
why?

1055
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:14,484
He's like curious.
My battery runs out like you have 70 

1056
00:45:16,591 --> 00:45:17,740
percent,
how are we going to run out?

1057
00:45:17,741 --> 00:45:19,620
And you've used it a lot.
He's always on it.

1058
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,900
So I was like,
that's actually a good challenge for you

1059
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,710
because you are consumed with it.
But he was like,

1060
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,570
I don't know,
he was pretty hesitant to accept that.

1061
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,480
The problem with that is it's a,
it's a tool for work.

1062
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,820
That's the point.
But his thing was like,

1063
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:34,620
well,
you can have your assistant,

1064
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:38,070
the guy that helps produce your podcast.
You could send him things and be like,

1065
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:39,720
Hey,
you got to post these things.

1066
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,690
You could post these promotions for my 
shows and Blah,

1067
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:44,340
blah blah.
But you can't be on.

1068
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:48,270
They're consumed by likes and consumed 
by comments and and that whole thing.

1069
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,350
I Dunno,
it was just,

1070
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,350
it was just definitely an idea.
It's not a bad idea.

1071
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:54,720
It's not a bad challenge.
Good luck with it.

1072
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,620
I'm out.
Yeah.

1073
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:57,630
I don't know.
I mean,

1074
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,310
I think the physical stuff is really,
really interesting and fun.

1075
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,090
The physical stuff,
the most interesting.

1076
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:07,110
Even like even for me,
a guy who does yoga on a regular basis,

1077
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:08,760
doing 15 of them in a month,
it was like,

1078
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:09,930
wow,
I've got a lot to make up.

1079
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:10,470
What would it be?

1080
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:12,060
Another good one.
I don't know.

1081
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:12,894
But let me tell you something,
that the last nine days I did nine days 

1082
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,040
straight,
you know,

1083
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,830
of Yoga and it wasn't the last nine 
days.

1084
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:22,740
I had plenty of time to go,
but I just decided to burn it all out in

1085
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:23,700
one shot.
I was like,

1086
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,593
I'm learning a lot about myself.
Like I've never done anything that's 

1087
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:30,310
that hard.
Ninety minute hot yoga classes,

1088
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,980
nine days in a row with no days off.
I was like,

1089
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:35,430
if you just don't give yourself a day 
off,

1090
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,280
your body starts to adapt to not having 
a day off.

1091
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,410
You can accomplish way more than you 
think you can.

1092
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,570
That's what that shit taught me.
You ever had like those.

1093
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,900
I remember being on the road once and 
having a deadline for a writing packet.

1094
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,270
It was some type of submission or they 
were like,

1095
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:51,123
I was getting paid like,
well you got to send it in by this by 

1096
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,043
like tomorrow.

1097
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:54,993
Yeah.
And I was doing so much writing in the 

1098
00:46:57,961 --> 00:47:01,230
hotel room and that when I submitted it 
and everything was fine,

1099
00:47:01,231 --> 00:47:02,370
I was like,
man,

1100
00:47:02,371 --> 00:47:04,530
I could get a lot of work that in these 
hotel rooms.

1101
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:05,743
Good.
But I needed that experience to tell me 

1102
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:07,580
that.
Yeah.

1103
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,780
Because all the time I'm like just 
sitting around and he's fucking hotel,

1104
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,100
right.
You just watching TV,

1105
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:13,170
flipping through the channels and not 
doing shit.

1106
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,400
Watching those fucking pawn shop shows 
and they're like,

1107
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:18,990
I just wrote fucking 20 pages.
Yeah,

1108
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,190
yeah,
yeah.

1109
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:22,770
If you just make yourself do it or you 
have.

1110
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,750
Like for me I have to have have two,
but one thing does help is when I have a

1111
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:29,830
schedule of shit that I wrote down.

1112
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,130
Like I have to work on my act for an 
hour a day for five days.

1113
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,180
Put that in there.
Yeah.

1114
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:39,670
Like that's.
I give my,

1115
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,550
I,
I,

1116
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:44,830
I think that's really reasonable.
I'll give myself five hours of writing a

1117
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:47,740
week.
That's totally to light.

1118
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,870
It's light work.
I've been working on it more expensive.

1119
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:51,880
I know my special special comes out 
tomorrow.

1120
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,340
Oh Shit.
Tommy Netflix,

1121
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:56,680
special number three in the pipe.
Bitch.

1122
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:00,400
I'm exciting.
Fresh coming out to Ivan.

1123
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,520
I'm excited for it.
But I also have that,

1124
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:04,563
that uh,
10 special anxiety corner where you're 

1125
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:07,900
like,
oh,

1126
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:08,734
it's back to square one.
But that's where the material comes 

1127
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:11,050
from.
Right?

1128
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:11,861
Totally.
Yeah,

1129
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:13,390
of course.
And I'm actually,

1130
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,030
I personally,
I don't know if everyone works this way.

1131
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,360
I definitely work better when it's a,
when it's 100 percent out,

1132
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:26,090
in other words,
not like the month to like,

1133
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:26,943
you know,
it's coming out in two months when it's 

1134
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,870
actually out.

1135
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:33,850
I feel the fear and the drive more,
I create more when I,

1136
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,200
when I know it's all,
it's gone now I,

1137
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,320
it really fuels me.
Me Too.

1138
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,593
Same thing.
But it's the scariest fucking thing in 

1139
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:44,560
the world.
Herald not scariest thing in the world,

1140
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:46,770
but it's,
it's scary because you're,

1141
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,950
you're so terrified of being up on stage
with what I call without weapons.

1142
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,150
Nothing.
Yeah.

1143
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,320
So you have to like really focus on 
getting that shit done.

1144
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,154
Yeah.
And then I find myself going to the 

1145
00:48:58,391 --> 00:48:59,224
store with notebooks.
I'm going over the shit before age just 

1146
00:49:01,931 --> 00:49:03,620
really tightened in.
Yeah.

1147
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:05,760
I'm doing a couple of spots tonight.
Like,

1148
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,690
yeah,
I have like all new shit.

1149
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,890
You have one hour you have.
I mean you literally have like one day.

1150
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,600
Yeah.
And then in one day.

1151
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,540
Yeah.
Better have all new shit tonight.

1152
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,210
You can go up and just whip out some 
polished,

1153
00:49:19,211 --> 00:49:23,680
smooth fucking sharpened weapons.

1154
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,390
I actually thought about it and it's 
like,

1155
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,650
you know,
I've been,

1156
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,543
I have been for the last especially 
month or so really focused on the new 

1157
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:34,090
stuff and I go,
so tonight's the last night.

1158
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,130
Do I feel like doing like will I do,
I want to say that thing one last time.

1159
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:42,100
And I was looking over like the bits and
I was like,

1160
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:43,750
not really.
I think I'm done,

1161
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:44,770
you know?
Yeah.

1162
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,633
So I'm trying to focus on just all new 
now we're being forced into this 

1163
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,320
position.
Yeah,

1164
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:51,783
for a good thing because you have fans 
because the fans want to hear new stuff 

1165
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,163
and it just makes me think about that.
I always used to pity those old guys 

1166
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:00,693
back in Boston that never wrote that 
they had that same hour that they would 

1167
00:50:04,181 --> 00:50:06,670
do for a decade.
That's so nuts to me.

1168
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:07,743
It's crazy to think about now because 
back then there was no social media and 

1169
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:15,610
none of these guys got on television,
so if you didn't go to see them alive,

1170
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,800
you did not know their material.
Yeah.

1171
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:20,140
Yeah.
That's really wild.

1172
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,033
It's crazy to think that that was the 
norm and that guys would polish an act 

1173
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:25,144
together and put it together and then 
they would just work and they would 

1174
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:28,220
never write and I fucking

1175
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:28,880
never.
Right.

1176
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,100
I feel like the norm now without 
question,

1177
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:31,934
I feel like it was kind of debated for a
little bit is definitely want a special 

1178
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,460
comes out.
Like that shit is gone.

1179
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:38,323
Yeah.
I feel like that's accepted now that 

1180
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:40,700
you're done with that.
Totally.

1181
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,890
Well,
I had a conversation with someone at the

1182
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:43,724
store a year ago because she did a 
special and then after the special she 

1183
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:48,670
was still doing the same material.
I go,

1184
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,660
what are you doing?
I go,

1185
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:51,131
she goes,
well,

1186
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,310
I don't think most of the people seeing 
that.

1187
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:53,001
I go,
Whoa,

1188
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:53,661
Whoa,
whoa,

1189
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:54,494
Whoa,
whoa.

1190
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,480
I go,
I guarantee you,

1191
00:50:56,481 --> 00:50:58,340
if they're coming to see you,
they're paying to see you.

1192
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,460
They've seen your work.
Yeah.

1193
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:00,980
Like she's like,
well,

1194
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,340
I'm in new material.
Whoa,

1195
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:03,950
why the fuck are you touring?
Yeah,

1196
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:07,420
like you can be touring with the same 
exact act.

1197
00:51:07,421 --> 00:51:10,070
It was on comedy central just six months
ago.

1198
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,610
You can't.
No,

1199
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,210
no.
Specially people paying,

1200
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:16,333
you know,
they,

1201
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,510
it,
it is weird and that you will,

1202
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:22,290
I ran into it a bunch of times,
but it's definitely the minority,

1203
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,990
which is the person who's like,
why didn't you do that one bit?

1204
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,380
And you're like,
because you know it.

1205
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,130
Go Watch that on Netflix.
Yeah,

1206
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,860
I think I told you,
but I did one,

1207
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,820
people were asking me to do some bits.
Uh,

1208
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,630
when I was touring,
I think it was not 20,

1209
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,770
17,
2016.

1210
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:41,940
They were like,
do,

1211
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:43,680
are you going to do this bit and that 
bit.

1212
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:46,320
So I just do one show at a club.
I was like,

1213
00:51:46,321 --> 00:51:47,070
I'm gonna,
try this,

1214
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,720
this thing out.
This encore thing,

1215
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,320
so I did my,
I did my new show and then I said,

1216
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:56,130
uh,
so people ask me to do some bits that,

1217
00:51:56,131 --> 00:51:57,060
you know,
or whatever.

1218
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:58,800
I forgot how I got into it,
so,

1219
00:51:58,801 --> 00:52:02,010
and that got this huge round of applause
and then I would be,

1220
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:04,230
I would start it and there'd be like a 
big,

1221
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,093
big applause.
I would go through the bit to complete 

1222
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:11,730
silence,
like they would just watch me do the bit

1223
00:52:11,731 --> 00:52:14,750
they know and then when I would end it,
another round of applause.

1224
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:15,603
I was like,
that's horrible.

1225
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,220
That was the worst feeling ever.
And the reason,

1226
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,710
because there was no lab because there 
was no surprise.

1227
00:52:21,711 --> 00:52:23,060
Like they're like,
yeah,

1228
00:52:23,061 --> 00:52:26,420
of course they knew the whole thing.
I did like the next bit and I was like,

1229
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:27,051
you might,
you know,

1230
00:52:27,051 --> 00:52:27,591
whatever.
No,

1231
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:29,570
this one as the same thing.
They're like,

1232
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:30,950
oh yeah,
we do know this one,

1233
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,900
and then I go through it and they were 
like,

1234
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,823
yeah,
no,

1235
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:37,520
that was horrible.
It was my one attempt at doing,

1236
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,500
you know?
Yeah.

1237
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,390
I don't even know how to do them.

1238
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,311
Yeah,
no,

1239
00:52:42,311 --> 00:52:44,130
it was an.
And then people were like,

1240
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,400
I was like,
I forgot the next line.

1241
00:52:45,401 --> 00:52:46,234
They were like,
it's this,

1242
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,430
like people knew he knew the bit better 
than I did.

1243
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:52,180
Yeah.
Somebody asked me something about the,

1244
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:53,023
um,
the bit about people breaking into the 

1245
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,990
White House about a woman who was 
guarding the front door,

1246
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,160
the White House by yourself.
That's on your last one.

1247
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:03,130
And I had to go back and watch it again.
I was like,

1248
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,780
ah,
I forgot all this.

1249
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,340
I literally forgot how it worked.
I forgot all the different beats

1250
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:12,970
and it's not in like in a day is not 
going to come together.

1251
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:14,110
Well,
no,

1252
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,130
a terrible.
I did a private event in Vegas for these

1253
00:53:18,131 --> 00:53:20,920
rich guys and I was like,
just,

1254
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:21,903
I flew in and I was talking to them like
five hours before the show and I was 

1255
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:25,681
like,
just so you know,

1256
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:26,280
I mean

1257
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,130
like I'm,
I'm doing my current show.

1258
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:29,970
And they're like,
oh,

1259
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:31,140
we were hoping you would do this,
this,

1260
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,940
this and this though.
And I was like,

1261
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,670
all right.
So I went up to my hotel room,

1262
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,140
pulled up Netflix,
started watching and making notes.

1263
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:41,453
And then I downloaded the album so I 
could listen to it and I would walk 

1264
00:53:44,131 --> 00:53:46,000
around and I was like,
no,

1265
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,223
like forgetting the thing that you think
is a throwaway is actually like a 

1266
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,410
connector.
The thing you're like fuck.

1267
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,650
And I was doing like halfassed versions 
of it at the show.

1268
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:56,633
Wow.
And they were still like on board with 

1269
00:53:58,021 --> 00:53:59,520
it,
but I was like that's not how that goes.

1270
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:01,973
I knew I was fucking it up.
How many specialists do you have out 

1271
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,060
now?
You have thrilled,

1272
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,540
which was a CDC,
the white girls,

1273
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,960
white girls cd seeding and then complete
hours.

1274
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,540
They're completely normal.
Completely normal.

1275
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:16,374
She's a special,
mostly stories especial and disgraceful 

1276
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,890
comes out to five hours of recorded 
shit.

1277
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:28,230
Like stop and imagine that if you had to
like do your whole catalog,

1278
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,200
like a bruce springsteen concert.
Yeah.

1279
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,433
You know,
I mean the thing about like a bruce 

1280
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:34,224
springsteen or any of those guys,
is that on any given night you could 

1281
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:37,524
bring back that one and really get it 
sharp again for like five nights and 

1282
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:42,330
then kind of drop it and then do you 
know what I mean?

1283
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,550
We go like,
that's old,

1284
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:45,980
I don't do that.
Yeah,

1285
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,823
and it just,
it just goes further and further away 

1286
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:50,240
from your mind,
but they have to like,

1287
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,490
if you go to see Bruce springsteen and 
he doesn't play born to run.

1288
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,100
Yeah.
You know,

1289
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:57,220
like what the fuck kind of piece of shit
show is this.

1290
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,130
I wonder.
I wonder because I feel like the.

1291
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,800
But then again though he's famous for 
doing like for our shows,

1292
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:09,440
so maybe he never does skip it because I
have so much energy and I know me.

1293
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,390
He's on those trump diet pills.
He's got to be.

1294
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:15,990
He definitely looks tired and every 
photo of course married.

1295
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,550
He's married,
he's doing.

1296
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,360
He's always like,
just doesn't know.

1297
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,320
Like,
should I just bail on all this?

1298
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:23,990
God,
God,

1299
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,050
incredible.
This is the,

1300
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,300
the,
the inside story.

1301
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:28,134
But a bruce springsteen and his concerts
has always been that people get bummed 

1302
00:55:31,771 --> 00:55:32,604
out when his wife was there.
Feel like they like Bruce without his 

1303
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:37,900
wife.
They're better than they like bruce with

1304
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,180
his wife.
They're like a friend of mine.

1305
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,390
Her friends.
Energy changing.

1306
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:42,224
Yeah.
Her friend is a crazy bruce springsteen 

1307
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:44,754
fan.
She goes to like tons and tons of 

1308
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:48,600
concerts,
sees him every year,

1309
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,210
all like multiple times a year,
all over the country.

1310
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:52,044
Crazy.
And the people that are like super 

1311
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:54,984
hardcore.
See there's a different energy that he 

1312
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:59,220
has called the wife sick.
The wife sick and she's sick.

1313
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,620
She's not here.
Yes.

1314
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,670
I'm fucking pumped.
When the wife's not there,

1315
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:07,170
it's hilarious things with his wife.
His wife's a part of the band,

1316
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,063
right?
She was with the tambourine or 

1317
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:10,830
something.
That's important.

1318
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,900
None of this shit works without that 
tambourine,

1319
00:56:15,901 --> 00:56:19,830
that tambourine fucking shows bunk.
I don't know man.

1320
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:24,870
I never could have imagined touring and 
working with your wife all the time.

1321
00:56:25,061 --> 00:56:25,894
My wife and I,
we always talk about how like it's 

1322
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:27,844
really unique.
We can do our podcast together and we 

1323
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:30,760
have fun doing it.
Yeah.

1324
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:32,740
But like when anyone.
But she leads.

1325
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:34,750
This is not like a guy thing.
When someone will be like,

1326
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,510
Hey,
do you guys ever tour together?

1327
00:56:37,511 --> 00:56:38,830
And she's like,
that's gay as fuck.

1328
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,540
No,
we're,

1329
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,000
we're two different people.
We do our own show.

1330
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,380
Like,
no,

1331
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:45,423
it's not to.
You guys are in a rare situation to 

1332
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:48,784
where are both really good.
It's usually one of you is really good 

1333
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,880
and the other one is like bad.
She's definitely not too bad.

1334
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,220
She does and she's a now shit.
I can't wait man.

1335
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,220
She's selling tickets and shows and was 
bawling.

1336
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,700
Gave me that money.
Give me money.

1337
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,260
You give me fucking shit.
Yeah.

1338
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,320
No,
I'm excited for her.

1339
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,183
I think she's one of the best comics in 
the country and she's awesome and she 

1340
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,953
knows.
Yeah.

1341
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:17,210
Christina don't sleep on her.
No,

1342
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,230
I mean I remember saying that to her one
night,

1343
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:22,090
like four or five years ago at the 
store.

1344
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:26,890
She'd fucking crushed in the or and uh,
I came up to upstairs go,

1345
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,960
no bullshit.
You're one of the best comics alive.

1346
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,850
That set that you just did right now 
that's one of the,

1347
00:57:31,851 --> 00:57:35,260
like,
it's not just funny but it's insightful.

1348
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:36,183
She's smart.
She points out shit that other people 

1349
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:41,530
aren't pointing out.
Real writer to writer writes a lot.

1350
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:42,813
How does she bright?
Does she sit in front of the computer 

1351
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:47,260
and paper and then a computer and then a
pen and paper.

1352
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,123
But yeah,
a lot of notes to writing a lot of 

1353
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:50,434
actual,
like you're talking about spending that 

1354
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,234
time working on it.
A lot of time you gotta do you know 

1355
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,353
that's the difference between someone 
who produces a lot of material and 

1356
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:02,150
someone who doesn't like I've had these 
conversations with people before.

1357
00:58:02,151 --> 00:58:02,711
It was like,
oh,

1358
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,090
I only write onstage.
I was like,

1359
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:05,350
all right.
Yeah.

1360
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,920
Why is that?
Because it's the only way it works.

1361
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:11,650
Or is it because you're lazy and this is
how you justify it?

1362
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,500
It's probably more of that,
more of that.

1363
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:13,950
Yeah,
for sure.

1364
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:16,620
Now that I write on stage stuff,
it's like,

1365
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,870
well I do too.
Yeah,

1366
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:21,460
I write onstage stuff but don't like to 
give it out as.

1367
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:22,683
The thing that drives me crazy is I see 
them giving it out as advice to other 

1368
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:27,780
young guns.
Like don't write on paper dude.

1369
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:28,900
Just say,
Hey,

1370
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:30,460
I write on stage man.
That's why I do like,

1371
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,020
okay.
Right,

1372
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:35,190
but is that the only way and is it the 
best way and isn't,

1373
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:36,024
isn't it possible that you're missing?
I say what happened was two was like 

1374
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:43,480
when Louie got like really,
really popular and he was just like,

1375
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:48,510
I never write anything down that became 
like folklore and attend like attractive

1376
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,770
to see comics.
I feel like,

1377
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,670
oh,
I gotta do that.

1378
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,710
So he said he never writes anything.
It doesn't,

1379
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,593
right?
Doesn't even write down bullet points 

1380
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:58,900
really just all in his head.
So then people are like,

1381
00:58:59,050 --> 00:58:59,700
oh,
you know,

1382
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,970
I think,
I think I heard,

1383
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:01,983
I started to hear that more when his 
fame really exploded and that was a big 

1384
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:07,684
thing,
you know,

1385
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:08,560
I was like,
not,

1386
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:09,910
you don't even write shit down.
They're like,

1387
00:59:09,911 --> 00:59:11,380
no.
Okay.

1388
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,070
Well I guess if you're doing stand up 
every night,

1389
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,700
three or four nights a week or three or 
four times a night,

1390
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,100
like you're doing those New York sets 
and you're constantly working

1391
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,100
constantly in your head,
you can get away with that.

1392
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,750
I would,
I guess you could,

1393
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:27,584
but like I would,
I always liked having at least a bullet 

1394
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:35,270
point list.
Like even when I wasn't writing anything

1395
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,520
long form down,
I still like to have that.

1396
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:40,460
Oh,
what can I just to see it all,

1397
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,470
like how the,
you know,

1398
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,483
how the,
how the movie plays out and they'd be 

1399
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:44,651
like,
oh,

1400
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:46,640
I should move this over here and this 
should be right here.

1401
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,580
I couldn't imagine not having any of 
that written down,

1402
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:52,400
but I just think that the more time you 
spend focusing on it,

1403
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:53,323
whether it's the more time you spend 
just writing stuff down or looking at 

1404
00:59:55,761 --> 01:00:00,590
bullet points or the just the more 
intention you put on things.

1405
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:02,570
More attention.
The more focused.

1406
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:03,643
Definitely.
It's gonna you're gonna have it's gonna 

1407
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,500
be better.
You're going to know it better.

1408
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:08,760
It's like getting good at anything.
Yeah,

1409
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,130
no.
You put a lot of time into it.

1410
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,930
It happened for you.
Yeah.

1411
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:12,960
Comedy,
writing those.

1412
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,130
One of the weirdest ones because 
everybody does it a different way.

1413
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,020
Yeah.
You know,

1414
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,853
everybody's got their own weird sort of 
style and no one can tell you exactly 

1415
01:00:22,011 --> 01:00:22,844
how to do.
Like you could never tell Theo Vaughn 

1416
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:26,390
how to write a joke,
right?

1417
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:27,950
No.
Initially him,

1418
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,450
his ax.
So odd.

1419
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:30,910
You know,
and know.

1420
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:34,340
Then you're like mispronounce things,
but like that's like.

1421
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,200
But it's like a disguised so well,
you know,

1422
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,670
it's like,
it's shit like that where you just like,

1423
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,260
how'd you come up with that?
You know,

1424
01:00:42,650 --> 01:00:44,510
was it an accident the first time like 
that,

1425
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,290
you know?
And then like I remember a Carlin,

1426
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:48,543
he would write on a note cards,
note cards and clubs and then kind of 

1427
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,190
shuffle through them and be like,
that's shit and throw it on the ground.

1428
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,870
And then,
uh,

1429
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,540
I saw him,
I saw him,

1430
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,493
one of his last tours,
that universal amphitheater and he for 

1431
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:07,943
his last,
because he called them like individual 

1432
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,573
pieces,
like his bits where it was really 

1433
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:17,830
heavily about the writing,
like the specific word play the flow,

1434
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,810
you know,
rhythm patterns.

1435
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:23,420
Like his comedy was very melodic like 
that.

1436
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:24,890
And when it got,
like,

1437
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,470
when it was like one of his closing 
pieces,

1438
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:32,710
it was like five pages and he brought 
out the pages and he's like,

1439
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,450
I'm going to read this because that's 
how I memorize it,

1440
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:39,170
memorize it by doing these shows and 
reading this.

1441
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:40,213
So just so you know,
for this thing I'm going to look at it 

1442
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,033
like he told the 6,000 people that wow.
And then he would know it and then flip 

1443
01:01:47,091 --> 01:01:49,070
the page and he's like,
how was it?

1444
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:50,563
It was funny,
man.

1445
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,403
It was great.
It was what it was like the second to 

1446
01:01:52,251 --> 01:01:55,590
last special and I remember the uh,
like it was a,

1447
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,940
it was a really well constructed piece 
of writing is a little throw,

1448
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,840
threw you off a little bit to have him 
be reading it,

1449
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:04,280
you know.
But he,

1450
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:06,290
I would say when he,
when I saw the show,

1451
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,363
that piece was probably at least half 
committed to memory and he was still 

1452
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,300
trying to like,
you know,

1453
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:13,251
repeat,
repeat,

1454
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:15,200
repeat to so that it would be in his 
memory.

1455
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,630
It was still really funny.
It was still really funny.

1456
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:19,770
Well he was also.
How many,

1457
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,040
how

1458
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,873
old was he?

1459
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:22,290
Sixty nine.
70.

1460
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:24,610
I think he died at 70.
So yeah,

1461
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,760
he looked.
He looked older because of,

1462
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,660
you know,
he,

1463
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,950
he went hard in the paint too.

1464
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:31,730
Drug use.
Yeah.

1465
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:34,850
But he was upset when he apparently had 
a pain pill.

1466
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:35,684
Problem for awhile because I remember 
there was a time when he committed 

1467
01:02:40,071 --> 01:02:45,071
himself to Rehab and uh,
I think it was wine and pills.

1468
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:48,380
He was taking pain pills plus kind of.
Damn opiates,

1469
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:52,220
man.
People they do get you get,

1470
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,063
you know,
but you got to think that your memory 

1471
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,473
must eventually at some point in time 
start to give out when you're doing 

1472
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:01,970
these long monologues.
Oh my God.

1473
01:03:01,971 --> 01:03:04,370
Do you do long,
long monologues?

1474
01:03:04,371 --> 01:03:07,040
Yeah.
Then he would write out his whole act,

1475
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:10,940
like the whole hour and then just start 
doing it.

1476
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:16,130
[inaudible] is a new one every year,
like reading like a book almost.

1477
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,050
I think you said 16 months was the 
turnaround

1478
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:18,993
that was.
Yeah.

1479
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:24,340
[inaudible] every year he ended up doing
14 think specialist.

1480
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:25,550
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1481
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:28,330
What are you up to now?
You have quite a few.

1482
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:33,760
Um,
like if you combine albums and specials.

1483
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:37,000
One,
two,

1484
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,790
three,
four,

1485
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:44,500
five,
six,

1486
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:48,430
seven.
I'm on my eighth.

1487
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,380
There's a lot.
That's a lot.

1488
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,970
You're going to catch him.
Number eight is coming up.

1489
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,730
Do you know what you're shooting it yet?
Boston.

1490
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,260
Are you doing in Boston?
Yeah,

1491
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,410
I just changed my mind.
Oh,

1492
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,381
oh,
sorry.

1493
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,930
Boston.
Would it be at the Wilbert?

1494
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:04,721
Yeah.
If,

1495
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:05,554
um,
if I,

1496
01:04:05,950 --> 01:04:06,783
I have one other idea in mind that I'm 
still bouncing around in my head at my 

1497
01:04:10,151 --> 01:04:11,500
house.
I'm thinking about that.

1498
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,280
Really?
Yeah,

1499
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,020
that'd be great.
And you kids are in while he's sleeping.

1500
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:18,370
That's awesome man.
That'd be a hit for four d,

1501
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:21,550
what did you think of Chappelle's?
Two specials.

1502
01:04:21,551 --> 01:04:26,200
I thought it was really interesting to 
see him do this big Polish special and a

1503
01:04:26,201 --> 01:04:30,160
big place and then do the little special
in the belly room.

1504
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:30,791
I was like,
well,

1505
01:04:30,791 --> 01:04:33,070
this is this.
The room felt weird,

1506
01:04:33,071 --> 01:04:33,650
man.
Well,

1507
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:36,980
I mean I personally,
my take on it is like the second one,

1508
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:41,981
the belly ruin w we're and we're in the 
practice of calling that a special,

1509
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,750
but it's really not a special,
in my opinion,

1510
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,730
what you're seeing is what here,
at least in definitely in Los Angeles.

1511
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,160
And if you live in San Francisco,
Denver,

1512
01:04:52,161 --> 01:04:52,994
New York places he likes to frequent a 
weight is what you see Dave chappelle 

1513
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,630
known for in these cities,
which is,

1514
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:05,020
he would drop into clubs and like spill 
out everything that's on his mind.

1515
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:06,793
So I mean,
I don't know if it's more like 

1516
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:09,440
semantics,
but it's like,

1517
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:10,843
it's not a special to me,
it's like you're seeing one of the best 

1518
01:05:13,941 --> 01:05:17,620
guys ever do a workout set,
like a,

1519
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:18,543
a loose riff.
It's only been six slash seven weeks 

1520
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:25,860
since the special was shot that that 
plays before it broke,

1521
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:26,723
when which he toured for like a year 
with that you can see how like polished 

1522
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:30,400
and,
you know what I mean?

1523
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,400
So I think it's really cool if you're a 
big standup nerd to see the other one,

1524
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:39,190
like that's what happens a lot in those 
cities that he,

1525
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,190
he'll just fly into and be like here's 
shit that's on my mind.

1526
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:42,981
Right.
And,

1527
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,590
and that.
So you're seeing like,

1528
01:05:44,591 --> 01:05:45,130
it's,
it's,

1529
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,890
it's masterful.
But I think it's like,

1530
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:48,840
I don't call,
I,

1531
01:05:48,841 --> 01:05:52,270
I think of it as separate then a 
special,

1532
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,550
you know,
like a [inaudible],

1533
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,430
a special to me is like,
you tour,

1534
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:00,690
you prepare and then like you present 
it.

1535
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,600
Right?
I mean,

1536
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:02,740
I know,
I understand that you'd be like,

1537
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:04,720
well yeah,
it's a separate thing as a special.

1538
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:09,721
But I'm saying that within that there's 
something really specific going on which

1539
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:12,940
is like,
this is like in the moment,

1540
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:18,730
uh,
almost all topical commentary and that's

1541
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:20,590
how that dude works.
He,

1542
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,840
he just,
he will walk into a club and be like,

1543
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:26,360
I want to get on stage and like just 
talk about it.

1544
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:27,203
He said he also,
he loves topical stuff so it fits 

1545
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,580
perfectly.
But it was,

1546
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,830
it's very different.
It's,

1547
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,020
I mean,
you can see the total differ,

1548
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:35,863
that contrast,
especially if you watch one after the 

1549
01:06:37,601 --> 01:06:38,680
other,
you know,

1550
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:39,514
you're watching toward proven like 
worked out stuff and like here's some 

1551
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:47,380
shit I thought of basically in the last 
week.

1552
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,161
Right,
right,

1553
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:49,840
right.
But a whole hour of it,

1554
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:51,270
which is really crazy.
Yeah.

1555
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:53,410
So prolific.
Yeah.

1556
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,900
And um,
the,

1557
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,350
the,
the fact,

1558
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:57,423
the way it worked was doing the two of 
them together that way you got to see 

1559
01:07:00,131 --> 01:07:03,310
the big Polish special when you get to 
see the fuck around workouts set.

1560
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,300
So it's like if you watched the big 
Polish specialty,

1561
01:07:05,301 --> 01:07:06,670
like I need more.
Yeah.

1562
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:08,680
It's really interesting to see,
uh,

1563
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:13,080
I think just to hear people go back and 
forth on which they liked more.

1564
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,110
I thought that was really interesting.
I've seen a bunch of people,

1565
01:07:16,111 --> 01:07:19,320
at least online.
I'll say they liked the belly room,

1566
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:19,880
you know?

1567
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:23,000
Well the belly room was so intimate to 
be in that room.

1568
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:23,834
I was there for one of those shows.
It's so interesting to be there when 

1569
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:30,440
you're watching someone film in front of
70 people.

1570
01:07:31,070 --> 01:07:33,410
It's so tight and small,
you know,

1571
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,450
you're kind of naked a little bit,
you know,

1572
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:40,430
and the people in the audience where 
they were fucking on the show.

1573
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:41,443
I mean,
the people that got those front row 

1574
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,160
seats,
they were,

1575
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,700
they were featured prominently in that 
Netflix.

1576
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:46,923
Yeah.
Kind of makes you entertain the idea of 

1577
01:07:48,921 --> 01:07:51,200
like a really small,
special what that would be like.

1578
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:52,620
Yeah.
There's,

1579
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,960
there's different kinds of comedy,
right?

1580
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:58,010
This is like the comedy that you do for 
70 people.

1581
01:07:58,011 --> 01:07:58,844
It's just not exactly the same as the 
comedy that has done it for $700 or 

1582
01:08:01,851 --> 01:08:04,970
$7,000 and the way you present it.
I mean he was,

1583
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,040
he basically sat for most of that.

1584
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,030
Yeah.
So that's,

1585
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,590
that's different.
You know what I mean?

1586
01:08:09,591 --> 01:08:12,410
Usually if you were in a big 2,500 
seater,

1587
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,690
you're not gonna like chill,
sit on a bench.

1588
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,720
Mark Marin,
mark parents cosby,

1589
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,460
oldschool cosby.
Yeah.

1590
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,353
Yeah.
He was always sitting even as you got 

1591
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,370
old.
Yeah.

1592
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,350
Cosby did it.
Not just old school cosby,

1593
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:26,330
but old,
old,

1594
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:27,441
old,
old cost.

1595
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,440
But you're right.
Do you think Qosmio tour again?

1596
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,540
No.
No,

1597
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:31,970
I think that's done.
It's over.

1598
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,320
Yeah.
Yeah,

1599
01:08:33,321 --> 01:08:34,380
I think so.
Well,

1600
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,750
I remember when he was touring promoters
obligations,

1601
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,510
but not.
I would think it's not worth the trouble

1602
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,650
really.
I think so,

1603
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:44,840
yeah.
I think Louisville to Oregon.

1604
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,130
You think so?
Yeah,

1605
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,810
I think so too.
Yeah.

1606
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,100
Yeah.
I think he'll take a year off.

1607
01:08:52,190 --> 01:08:53,023
Yeah.
And then he'll do some shows and people 

1608
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:55,424
get mad

1609
01:08:55,830 --> 01:08:57,550
and then it'd be a.
and then like if,

1610
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:58,523
you know,
the real thing is like the corporate 

1611
01:08:59,111 --> 01:09:00,760
side of it,
like in other words,

1612
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:06,300
a channel or network that would went to,
let's say host show the special,

1613
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:08,853
but he has such a dedicated.
No one's website following is like what 

1614
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:17,791
he ended up developing and he's sold 
shows and made millions,

1615
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:20,710
you know,
when people were doing the like download

1616
01:09:20,711 --> 01:09:24,460
my special thing.
I think he could book a venue,

1617
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:29,500
shoot something and go back to his $5 
model and do really well.

1618
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:30,723
No,
I'm sure he could and people would be 

1619
01:09:31,451 --> 01:09:34,480
really interested to see it.
Of course netflix would have them on.

1620
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,290
They still have his old stuff.
Old stuff.

1621
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,190
Yeah.
I mean I,

1622
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:40,570
yeah,
I was on a flight after,

1623
01:09:40,571 --> 01:09:43,600
right after all of it went down.
I watched his,

1624
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:45,420
uh,
the special from DC,

1625
01:09:45,430 --> 01:09:49,300
which I thought was really interesting 
to watch it knowing the DC one was,

1626
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:51,820
is that the latest lotus one,
2017.

1627
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,043
But just to know that it was like right 
around the corner that he was going to 

1628
01:09:56,201 --> 01:09:57,650
get busted.
Yeah.

1629
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:01,600
Beating off in front of people.
It's a weird thing to get caught,

1630
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:02,443
dylan,
to get to all the things that people 

1631
01:10:04,211 --> 01:10:05,044
have done that they got caught doing all
the rape accusations and all the 

1632
01:10:07,661 --> 01:10:08,494
horrible shit.
Like his is the most pathetic and also 

1633
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:14,310
kind of the most innocuous.
Yeah,

1634
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:17,590
just humiliating.
Just petering off in front of people.

1635
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,030
I know.
It's like his kink,

1636
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,000
it's what he likes,
but it could be way worse,

1637
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:22,690
you know,
like what,

1638
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:26,950
what he actually did not saying it's a 
good thing to do to people now it's hey,

1639
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:30,070
watch me beat off.
I know a bunch of people.

1640
01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:32,630
He did it to apparently laughed.
Yeah.

1641
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:36,730
Quite a few comics that I've talked to 
that know people that

1642
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,400
he did it too.
Yeah,

1643
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:39,370
I knew somebody.
They did.

1644
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:40,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

1645
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:46,010
And which she think not happy.
Um,

1646
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,240
but like,
you know,

1647
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:51,710
I don't know,
man.

1648
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,110
It was like weird.
I knew it for a long time.

1649
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,340
That story.
Yeah.

1650
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:56,930
And I,
I mean I said it before.

1651
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:57,764
I was like,
I mean,

1652
01:10:58,610 --> 01:10:59,443
I knew it and then like every other 
person I talked to in comedy to it and 

1653
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,630
we were all like,
that's fucked up,

1654
01:11:05,631 --> 01:11:06,464
but also,
I mean this doesn't excuse it at all 

1655
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:08,624
either,
but there is something about something 

1656
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,110
at least that as you know,
that something somebody did a while ago.

1657
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,570
So it's like,
what am I supposed to bring this shit up

1658
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:19,404
to them?
Right.

1659
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,090
You know,
like how do you know?

1660
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:22,303
But,
but the other thing is how do you even 

1661
01:11:22,831 --> 01:11:27,810
know that they did it because one of the
things that happened during the whole,

1662
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:28,703
like,
did he do it or do not do it thing 

1663
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:34,020
before it came out was uh,
someone had told me that it was bullshit

1664
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:34,883
and that what he had done is take some 
pictures of female comedians with his 

1665
01:11:38,821 --> 01:11:41,670
dick out just being silly and stupid and
like,

1666
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,253
and then tell him,
please delete those pictures were just 

1667
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:45,350
having fun,
you know,

1668
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,260
how do I get in trouble?

1669
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,200
I mean,
the story I heard was very specific.

1670
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,400
Yeah.
And like,

1671
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:53,130
you know,
is basically one of the stories reported

1672
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,083
in the times and I was like,
I remember hearing that story and the 

1673
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:57,580
person was not,
you know,

1674
01:11:58,260 --> 01:11:59,093
was pretty upset about it.
And then a lot of people heard the 

1675
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:01,541
story.
Yeah.

1676
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:03,330
And then I dunno,
you know,

1677
01:12:03,331 --> 01:12:06,120
another year would go by and two years 
and three years and you're like,

1678
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,280
okay,
I mean that's bad.

1679
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:10,700
But like as far as my role in it,
you know,

1680
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:11,693
as somebody who knows the story now,
it was just one of those things where 

1681
01:12:13,861 --> 01:12:14,311
you'd be like,
yeah,

1682
01:12:14,311 --> 01:12:17,550
that's fucked up story.
I mean it's not someone that like,

1683
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,450
Hey,
you know,

1684
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:23,070
that guy he fucking punched someone 15 
years ago was a real asshole.

1685
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:24,090
And you're like,
that sucks,

1686
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,370
you know.
But 15 years ago is a long time.

1687
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:27,181
Right.
I mean,

1688
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:29,040
kind of it's like is there,
is there,

1689
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,780
it's not to like minimize the 
wrongdoing,

1690
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:36,860
but like I sit there some part of the 
conversation about how people mature and

1691
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,110
become different people as they get 
older.

1692
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:43,320
And I'm sure a lot of people that are in
their fifties and sixties,

1693
01:12:43,321 --> 01:12:44,590
you go like,
you know,

1694
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,290
who are not celebrities.
You'd be like,

1695
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,153
do you know that when this guy was 26 he
did this fucking horrible stupid thing 

1696
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:52,710
or something like Jesus.
But you're like,

1697
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:53,350
well,
you know,

1698
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:55,410
there's long time ago now.
I mean that was kind of,

1699
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:59,760
at least that part of the conversation 
exists in this.

1700
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:00,611
Right?
It's like it's,

1701
01:13:00,611 --> 01:13:02,370
it,
it's something really bad and he's being

1702
01:13:02,371 --> 01:13:03,360
punished.
So that's,

1703
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:05,790
we're not saying that it's,
it's definitely,

1704
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,740
it has not been excused because he's 
being punished.

1705
01:13:07,741 --> 01:13:11,220
But it's also old behavior.
Yeah.

1706
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,580
Like that's the Dustin Hoffman thing,
you know,

1707
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:17,040
Dustin Hoffman,
this is where it gets really strange.

1708
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:22,070
A lot of his stuff was 30 years ago,
1985 and shit.

1709
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,153
It's like,
I think part of the difference too 

1710
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:25,283
between the Hoffman stuff and Louis and 
maybe everybody else is louise 

1711
01:13:29,341 --> 01:13:30,720
admission.
Right?

1712
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,600
That's very different because even the 
stuff I heard with Hoffman,

1713
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:34,733
he is like,
he's definitely trying to justify a 

1714
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,910
versions and the behavior and that's 
what people did you know,

1715
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:43,260
is that what he said?
Oh yeah.

1716
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:43,861
He's like,
you know,

1717
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:47,310
on the set like you try to like get,
you know,

1718
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,030
you have to break the tension or 
there's,

1719
01:13:49,031 --> 01:13:49,864
there's a monotony to it.
And so people would have these 

1720
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:55,890
conversations and say,
so it's like he's trying to appears that

1721
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:58,650
he's trying to be less accountable for 
what he said.

1722
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,000
Yeah.
Whereas Louis was like,

1723
01:14:00,001 --> 01:14:01,980
these stories are true,
so it's,

1724
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:02,993
I think all those things end up 
affecting how your redemption goes 

1725
01:14:07,351 --> 01:14:09,570
because they're like somebody like,
I did this shit.

1726
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:11,800
I was wrong.
Right.

1727
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:16,390
And I think in this country people love 
punishment.

1728
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,460
Like are you punished for the thing you 
did?

1729
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:21,370
We hate like somebody getting away with 
something.

1730
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:22,983
So part of him I think coming back will 
also be the people realize that he paid 

1731
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:28,120
a price.
I mean he lost deals.

1732
01:14:28,121 --> 01:14:29,980
He lost shows.
Last money.

1733
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:32,320
Definitely lost a lot of fucking touring
money.

1734
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:36,400
Yeah.
It's that day is probably at least a $50

1735
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:37,570
million a day for him,
you know,

1736
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:39,730
with everything together.
So crazy.

1737
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,100
Yeah.
I mean,

1738
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:45,760
what a weird kink jerk off in front of 
people.

1739
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:47,700
Yeah.
I wonder how you develop it.

1740
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:48,543
I mean,
I guess I can imagine how you develop 

1741
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,223
it.
Do you think that you could even do 

1742
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:52,480
that?
Like I was trying to think,

1743
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:53,980
could I even ask them,
Hey,

1744
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:54,843
do you mind if I jerk off in front of 
you and then just get hard and actually 

1745
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:58,630
like,
well that's the thing.

1746
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:01,690
I imagine he had to be leaking ripe like
before that,

1747
01:15:01,691 --> 01:15:02,524
like to come that fast.
It had to be something he's thinking 

1748
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:09,190
about all day and like hanging out and 
then like,

1749
01:15:09,191 --> 01:15:10,210
Hey,
do you want to hang out?

1750
01:15:10,211 --> 01:15:12,050
Like do you want to come back?
Or whatever might come up.

1751
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:15,130
And so as he's getting closer to doing 
it,

1752
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,640
I'm sure it's,
it's,

1753
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:19,120
it's the only fuel that's on his mind,
you know?

1754
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:21,370
So it's like to just ask me that,
I'd be like,

1755
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:22,600
well that's not my kink.
So you're like,

1756
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,553
hey,
could you go from fully flacid to come 

1757
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:26,340
out of these people?
Like,

1758
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:30,220
I don't think so man.
I don't think I could do that.

1759
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:32,440
No.
Kinks are fucking weird.

1760
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:35,740
Kinks are weird.
You know,

1761
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:36,603
like I had a friend and him and his 
girlfriend and used to tie each other 

1762
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:40,960
up.
They tie each other both up.

1763
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:42,220
Ball gags.
Yeah.

1764
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,380
The whole deal.
And He loved it.

1765
01:15:44,381 --> 01:15:48,480
He would talk about it with great glee.
Yeah.

1766
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:49,570
I'd be like,
why?

1767
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:51,850
Why do you like tiny each other up?
Like,

1768
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:53,200
what are you doing?
Yeah.

1769
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,730
Hi.
It's fucking great.

1770
01:15:55,430 --> 01:15:56,263
It's just something about like trusting 
that person to put that rope in their 

1771
01:15:59,471 --> 01:16:04,471
mouth and like I wonder how much,
how many of those kinks develop later?

1772
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:05,734
Like you realize it later as opposed to 
like the more common theory that 

1773
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:12,120
everything's tied to childhood.
So that must have been,

1774
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,233
you must have been tied up or something 
as a kid once and then you somehow 

1775
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,510
relate that to sex.
But I wonder if the,

1776
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:23,080
if you can be 28 and be like man,
it's tying thing is fucking awesome.

1777
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:26,200
I guarantee you can just date one crazy 
person,

1778
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:27,273
like if you have one girl who's just a 
wild animal in the sack and she just 

1779
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:31,360
wants to tie you up and you're like,
all right,

1780
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:31,990
let's do it.

1781
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,820
Yeah,
she doesn't your love it.

1782
01:16:33,821 --> 01:16:37,060
And it's amazing.
And as we need to answer.

1783
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:39,410
Where's Jim Norton when you need it?
Oh yeah.

1784
01:16:39,411 --> 01:16:40,244
He would go deep with this.
He gets all sweaty and shit and it's 

1785
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,600
bugging out.
I blinking.

1786
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

1787
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,830
Nobody embraces their kinks more than 
him though.

1788
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:49,270
Yeah,
I fucking admire that.

1789
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:51,490
So yeah,
everything,

1790
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:55,600
whether it's trannies or any,
anything that he's experienced friends,

1791
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,590
that's it.
He says it.

1792
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:57,850
He says,
oh he does.

1793
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,733
Yeah.
And he's definitely supports the 

1794
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:03,250
industry.
So the industry is that.

1795
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:08,080
It's weird that you can't say tranny.
Tranny is somehow or another negative.

1796
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,560
Yeah.
Look,

1797
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,860
these are noises that we make by now.
Chappelle was like the,

1798
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:13,410
that was the thing,
you know,

1799
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,243
he brought,
he got a lot of shit on the old one or 

1800
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:21,250
the one from a year ago and so he,
he brought up the topic again,

1801
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:22,730
but he's said Trans people.
Yeah.

1802
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,230
It was real specific on that part.
I guess the last one he was like fucking

1803
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,073
Chinese man.
Well there's certainly a lot of thought 

1804
01:17:30,861 --> 01:17:31,870
policing going on

1805
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,940
and there's language policing.
We have to wonder,

1806
01:17:35,941 --> 01:17:36,774
like how much of that affects the way 
people actually feel and how much and 

1807
01:17:44,121 --> 01:17:48,510
how much of it is just people trying to 
control the way people communicate and,

1808
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:49,363
and dictating the languages because like
when you go to the far end of the 

1809
01:17:52,611 --> 01:17:54,830
spectrum,
there's these new,

1810
01:17:55,630 --> 01:17:57,900
uh,
gender pronouns that there's,

1811
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:02,920
there's literally ems or 78 of them,
which I think are utterly preposterous,

1812
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:04,610
absurd,
absurd,

1813
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:07,920
absurd.
You're make believing you have,

1814
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:12,050
you've make-believe language,
you're inventing all these new words and

1815
01:18:12,051 --> 01:18:16,760
it's not like there's some universal 
agreement going on and everybody.

1816
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:19,400
It's not like remember when ms dot was 
the thing.

1817
01:18:19,720 --> 01:18:24,720
Yeah,
there was mrs and Mr. but then there was

1818
01:18:24,861 --> 01:18:29,861
miss [inaudible] and Mr was married or 
Mr [inaudible] was not married and women

1819
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:30,501
were like,
well,

1820
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:32,480
what the fuck?
How come we don't have one of those?

1821
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,730
Yeah.
So they came up with ms.ms dot,

1822
01:18:34,731 --> 01:18:36,310
but it never really stuck.
No,

1823
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,840
like nobody uses Ms.

1824
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:39,530
No,
it has to be like a real formal,

1825
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,400
you know,
Raven.

1826
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:46,250
Would you say ms dot,
I guess they would ever in writing,

1827
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:47,210
they might,
you know,

1828
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:50,580
might write ms if it was like,
I don't know,

1829
01:18:50,650 --> 01:18:55,190
a piece of journalism or something to 
add to indicate the person that's single

1830
01:18:55,191 --> 01:18:56,570
status.
Never hear that.

1831
01:18:57,050 --> 01:18:58,210
Yeah.
But you don't hear it spoken a lot.

1832
01:18:58,260 --> 01:18:58,830
No,
no,

1833
01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:00,800
but they were trying to push for it for 
awhile.

1834
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:01,733
Yeah.
And that was something that was like on 

1835
01:19:03,721 --> 01:19:06,690
the borderline of being accepted by the 
Common Vanessa.

1836
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:07,553
Killer shit is xer.
I also wonder like how many people are 

1837
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:16,560
just professionally upset at shit that's
said wrong.

1838
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:17,640
You know,
like they,

1839
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:20,130
they're just,
their reaction to everything is like,

1840
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:25,140
it's like their job is to police and 
react in a fucking.

1841
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:25,441
No,
no,

1842
01:19:25,441 --> 01:19:26,071
no.
That's not.

1843
01:19:26,071 --> 01:19:26,940
Okay.
What about,

1844
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,700
it's like almost how academia exist 
today.

1845
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,550
You see like the way that people are on 
campuses,

1846
01:19:32,551 --> 01:19:33,384
it's like fucking.
That is not a reflection of the real 

1847
01:19:35,431 --> 01:19:36,264
world.
No.

1848
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:38,880
To consider everyone's feelings at all 
times.

1849
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:41,010
Why?
That's not how shit works.

1850
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,140
No,
no.

1851
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,880
People get upset and get offended at 
things.

1852
01:19:44,881 --> 01:19:46,110
That's fine,
but like that,

1853
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:46,944
everyone should like dial back 
everything they say to make sure 

1854
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:51,100
everyone feels protected.
That's not how it should.

1855
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:54,020
What's been really interesting in the 
last five days,

1856
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,913
there's been a battle going on in my 
twitter mentions that I haven't dived 

1857
01:19:58,071 --> 01:19:59,900
into at all really.
But yeah,

1858
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,003
but lesbians had been going at it with 
transgender people in my twitter 

1859
01:20:04,911 --> 01:20:05,744
mentions,
and this is like long ongoing 

1860
01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:08,190
conversation with going back

1861
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,023
and forth and remarkably civil.
But what's interesting is all these 

1862
01:20:13,621 --> 01:20:14,454
lesbians,
one of the things they've been saying 

1863
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,380
it's been,
I dive in every now and then I read some

1864
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:20,370
of it and going,
what the fuck?

1865
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:21,690
This is crazy.
I gotta get Outta here.

1866
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:25,390
But that lesbians,
um,

1867
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,393
we're trying to say that a lot of the 
violence that happens in supposedly 

1868
01:20:31,021 --> 01:20:31,854
lesbian relationships is actually 
transgender men to women where they 

1869
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:36,534
switched over and then they're beating 
up their girlfriends and they're 

1870
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:45,260
bringing their masculine toxic violence 
into the world of lesbianism.

1871
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:47,580
And they're not willing to be honest 
about it.

1872
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:51,270
And there was all this crazy debate 
going on back and forth.

1873
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:54,000
This lady was citing statistics of how 
many.

1874
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:57,780
I'm wondering how accurate that is.
I don't know how many women in which she

1875
01:20:57,781 --> 01:20:59,130
was a lesbian and she was pretty,
uh,

1876
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:01,920
pretty.
Not that you're a fucking expert,

1877
01:21:01,921 --> 01:21:03,750
100 percent on facts if you're a 
lesbian,

1878
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,340
but she was pretty adamant she was a 
lesbian who was like,

1879
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,260
well,
the other thing she was saying,

1880
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:11,273
lesbians like women and that she doesn't
know any lesbians that want to date a 

1881
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:17,460
transgender woman like that.

1882
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:21,090
Used to have someone who used to be a 
man and is now a woman.

1883
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:22,820
She was like,
that's not what we're attracted to it.

1884
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:26,910
And actually women wouldn't.
That kind of negate the argument because

1885
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:27,900
they're like,
she's,

1886
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,153
if,
if formerly male transgender women are 

1887
01:21:32,071 --> 01:21:35,280
beating up their lesbian girlfriends,
then there are lesbians out there.

1888
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,840
There are some that are dating and 
attracted to these transgender women.

1889
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:42,390
Yeah.
It does get it muddy there,

1890
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:43,260
right?
Yeah.

1891
01:21:43,410 --> 01:21:44,310
Yeah.
So she's saying like,

1892
01:21:44,311 --> 01:21:45,150
we're not into that.
It's like,

1893
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:45,984
well,
your stats then don't back up your 

1894
01:21:46,861 --> 01:21:49,110
argument because that's clearly what 
you're indicating.

1895
01:21:49,111 --> 01:21:49,944
You're saying that these transgender 
women that were formerly men are dating 

1896
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:55,500
women and beating him up.
I think she was saying,

1897
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,383
and people she knows her friends.
So like Elizabeth and Sarah aren't into 

1898
01:22:01,231 --> 01:22:02,100
it,
so that's supposed to.

1899
01:22:02,101 --> 01:22:03,060
It's like,
how else could,

1900
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:03,420
you know?

1901
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:04,253
I mean,
you'd have to have like a pole you gals 

1902
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:08,760
out there and eating pussy,
like eating fake pussy.

1903
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:09,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

1904
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:13,530
That's a wild stat to consider.
I'd never thought of that.

1905
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:14,423
Yeah.
And there was this going back and forth 

1906
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:21,591
with lesbians versus a transgender women
and then they started getting.

1907
01:22:22,740 --> 01:22:26,190
Some people started getting hostile,
like let's just cut the shit.

1908
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:28,980
You have a y chromosome,
you're a fucking man.

1909
01:22:29,130 --> 01:22:30,840
And then it was like,
whoa.

1910
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:36,410
There was a lot of that going on.
There was a lot of you want us to assume

1911
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,953
and not just assume we want.
You want us to just go along with the 

1912
01:22:43,711 --> 01:22:48,711
idea that you absolutely are the wrong 
gender and there's no way that you could

1913
01:22:49,771 --> 01:22:50,604
just be crazy.
There's no way you could actually have 

1914
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:54,840
gender dysphoria.
There's no way you could actually have a

1915
01:22:54,841 --> 01:22:57,420
mental illness.
It's impossible and that's.

1916
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:01,290
That's one of the weird things about any
group,

1917
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,570
right?
You're going to have a certain amount of

1918
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:06,600
people that are mentally insane.
They're mentally there.

1919
01:23:06,601 --> 01:23:07,900
They're gonna.
Oh yeah.

1920
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:08,830
Group.
Any group,

1921
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:11,710
any group or there's a certain.
If you have a thousand people,

1922
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:14,470
there's a certain percentage of those 
people that are just going to be insane.

1923
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:17,350
Yeah,
but when it comes to gender,

1924
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:21,580
we're supposed to ignore that were never
supposed to think like out of your mind.

1925
01:23:21,581 --> 01:23:22,120
Yeah.
No,

1926
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,320
you're out of your mind.
You're.

1927
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:24,820
Yeah.
You know,

1928
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:28,150
you're definitely a woman born in a 
man's body and did I tell you,

1929
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:31,570
I support all the trans rights and 
everyone doing all this stuff.

1930
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:35,860
The only thing that I ever go like that 
doesn't seem right is with athletics.

1931
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,083
Oh yeah.
That's the only thing where I feel like 

1932
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,033
it's not that I don't feel like someone 
should be able to play any sport 

1933
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:43,420
compete,
but like when a dude,

1934
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:47,440
it transitions to becoming a woman and 
was like,

1935
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,490
I play basketball now.

1936
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:49,720
It's like,
come on man.

1937
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,400
Yeah.
Like I get it.

1938
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:52,410
You're,
you,

1939
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:54,250
you have the right to live your life and
play,

1940
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:55,084
but like you have all those skills that 
you developed as a man and now you're 

1941
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:04,330
playing against frailer,
smaller,

1942
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:06,310
you know,
like that.

1943
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:08,770
To say that like you can't bring that 
up,

1944
01:24:08,771 --> 01:24:11,290
that that's offensive is ridiculous to 
me.

1945
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:12,940
Well,
especially when it comes to fighting.

1946
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:13,863
Fuck yeah man.
That was the big one and that was where 

1947
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:21,100
I really understood like how bizarre and
defensive for that.

1948
01:24:21,101 --> 01:24:23,610
Yeah.
How cult like this,

1949
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:28,630
this ideology is that like to see you 
transition to a woman and fight women.

1950
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,710
It'd be fun to have what,
12 murder charges.

1951
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,200
That would be the fun part.
It doesn't make any sense.

1952
01:24:35,201 --> 01:24:36,034
No,
of course not.

1953
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,460
The bone structure is so different and 
people that deny that are fucking crazy.

1954
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:40,050
I know.

1955
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,320
That's that.
That is silly,

1956
01:24:41,321 --> 01:24:43,690
man.
What if I like transition,

1957
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:47,510
whatever anyone man and does a power 
lifting well,

1958
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,403
people have done that and they're 
winning and breaking all these records 

1959
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,120
they are,
and why are we like,

1960
01:24:52,121 --> 01:24:54,910
why are we not stopping being like that,
doesn't know.

1961
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:57,230
That doesn't want to save people's 
feeling.

1962
01:24:57,231 --> 01:24:58,064
Exactly and silly.
What's really fascinating is in the 

1963
01:25:00,761 --> 01:25:05,761
process of being super progressive,
you,

1964
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:06,903
you go towards the most maligned,
a part section of society which is like 

1965
01:25:11,981 --> 01:25:12,814
transgender people and so everybody else
who also has been marginalized by 

1966
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:22,030
society like women,
women get put on there.

1967
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,910
They get put in a less protected 
category.

1968
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,223
Transgender women,
so a man becomes a more protected class 

1969
01:25:31,391 --> 01:25:34,990
of woman.
Then a natural born woman herself.

1970
01:25:34,991 --> 01:25:36,920
That's very interesting.
That's crazy.

1971
01:25:36,921 --> 01:25:38,200
It is.
It's very true.

1972
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:39,190
Also.
Yeah.

1973
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:40,024
It's crazy because all these women that 
got beaten up by that man who became a 

1974
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:45,490
woman,
started fighting in mma,

1975
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,533
fought to women before ever disclosing 
the fact that she used to be a man 

1976
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:54,790
because she said it was a medical issue 
that had nothing to do with them,

1977
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:59,790
which is just shows you how completely 
insane the logic behind all this.

1978
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:02,350
She's still fight this.
She hasn't been awhile,

1979
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,010
but uh,
now

1980
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:06,410
everybody knows she lost to a woman who 
did.

1981
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:08,750
Yeah.
Was an actual one who wound up.

1982
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,531
Uh,
yeah.

1983
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:11,400
I said actual fuck off.
Yeah.

1984
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,360
People are like,
whoa.

1985
01:26:13,230 --> 01:26:18,080
Wait,
what did you say?

1986
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,130
That's wild,
right?

1987
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:22,130
That a woman beat good.
No,

1988
01:26:22,131 --> 01:26:23,770
she's not good.
She's not going to fight her.

1989
01:26:23,771 --> 01:26:24,950
No.
She's just strong.

1990
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:27,980
Like there's nothing.
You don't look at her and think like,

1991
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:28,814
oh,
she fights like Chris Cyborg or she 

1992
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,120
boxes like Claressa shields.
No,

1993
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,080
she's not that unbelievably talented.
She is physically way different.

1994
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,570
Yeah.
She's a fucking man.

1995
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:43,820
Some man for 30 years had children.
This was when I knew it was crazy.

1996
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:48,000
I got into conversation with someone and
online with this woman was like,

1997
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,250
she's always been a man.
I go,

1998
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:54,550
even when she got another woman pregnant
and had children with her and she goes,

1999
01:26:54,891 --> 01:26:56,450
yes.
Even then she was a woman.

2000
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:57,313
She was a woman.
She was a woman that fucked another 

2001
01:26:58,461 --> 01:27:00,690
woman who got her pregnant.
Okay.

2002
01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:02,180
What?
Just hang up.

2003
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,010
What?
What are we doing?

2004
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:04,873
I know like this is so crazy.
You got to tap out of those kinds of 

2005
01:27:07,001 --> 01:27:08,300
things.
Even Bruce Jenner,

2006
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:12,050
when he transitioned to Caitlyn Jenner 
and then eventually got his.

2007
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,840
His surgery,
right.

2008
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,900
Got Her surgery become.
She said even before the surgery though,

2009
01:27:17,901 --> 01:27:20,840
it didn't change anything.
I was always 100 percent a woman.

2010
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:23,900
Okay.
Then why get surgery?

2011
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:24,793
Well,
because you're thinking that gender is 

2012
01:27:27,651 --> 01:27:31,070
just with Genitalia.
Liam mistake you personally.

2013
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:34,580
What is it?
It's genders,

2014
01:27:34,581 --> 01:27:36,200
not just genitals.
It's in your mind.

2015
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,600
Right.
So,

2016
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:43,080
so it's also a facial reconstruction.
Just said something fucking stupid and I

2017
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:46,640
just let you know how dumb that was.
So what is the difference?

2018
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:47,593
Someone said that there's gender and 
then there's there's biological sex and 

2019
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:57,660
gender is the operating system,
and biological sex is the hardware.

2020
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:58,963
I hundred percent agree.

2021
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:01,983
It makes sense.
Outrage over transgender female weight 

2022
01:28:07,191 --> 01:28:09,800
lifter who destroy her rivals by 
hoisting.

2023
01:28:10,040 --> 01:28:12,890
Nineteen kilograms more than the runner 
up.

2024
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,530
Now she's a contender for the 
Commonwealth Games.

2025
01:28:15,531 --> 01:28:16,600
That's A.
Yeah.

2026
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,750
Yeah.
Guess what?

2027
01:28:17,900 --> 01:28:19,850
Oh my God.
Look at the size of her.

2028
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:20,684
Fuck laurels it God damn gorilla.
So maynard country national 

2029
01:28:24,981 --> 01:28:29,750
weightlifting debut in Melbourne's about
pounds more than the second place.

2030
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:33,980
Yeah.
What in the fucking Holy Hell.

2031
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:36,020
Oh my God.
And look at the size of her.

2032
01:28:36,140 --> 01:28:36,973
Fuck.
Can you imagine if you're a biological 

2033
01:28:40,821 --> 01:28:44,390
woman who has been training and working 
hard all her life?

2034
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:45,253
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden you have to 

2035
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:49,420
compete with this and you're like,
I'm first place like and she's giant.

2036
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:51,890
Like look at the size of her head or 
formerly male head.

2037
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:53,840
Yeah.
That's a giant woman.

2038
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:56,880
That's just the way to get metals.
Sandbagging.

2039
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:58,310
Yeah.
That's what a lot of it is.

2040
01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:59,710
That's fucked up man.
That is,

2041
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:01,410
that's what it is.
What a lot of it is,

2042
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:03,510
people don't want to admit that.
Yeah,

2043
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:04,533
sandbagging,
if you don't know what it means is like 

2044
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,690
you would get that in martial arts 
tournaments,

2045
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,980
like say you would have a tournament and
the tournament would be um,

2046
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:15,510
like for blue belts on lane,
which was like one rank above white belt

2047
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:16,913
and then guys would be like a black belt
in judo and they would enter into the 

2048
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:24,430
blue belt division and dump everybody 
and he's like a belt in that,

2049
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:25,883
but he's sandbagging and like,
you know what they're doing and 

2050
01:29:28,021 --> 01:29:30,530
everybody knows what they're doing.
You see that shit and you,

2051
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:31,364
you see there's,
there's a lot of that where people just 

2052
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:36,420
want to win.
And the way they can win is by competing

2053
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:37,800
against people that are not on their 
same level.

2054
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:38,663
Sure.
If you don't think that people do that 

2055
01:29:40,050 --> 01:29:40,883
when they switch over from being a man 
for 30 years and then competing as a 

2056
01:29:44,191 --> 01:29:47,190
woman and not tell them and just start 
smashing these women.

2057
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:50,460
So there's something in that that you 
don't understand.

2058
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:52,770
Athletics,
you don't understand competition.

2059
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:56,370
You don't understand sandbaggers and you
don't understand the kind of people that

2060
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:58,290
wouldn't tell people about that in the 
first place.

2061
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,310
Sure,
yeah,

2062
01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:01,560
but they don't want to look at it that 
way.

2063
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:02,453
They want to.
Everything has to go through the filter 

2064
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:05,154
of being progressive,
so you have to err on the side of being 

2065
01:30:09,691 --> 01:30:10,524
the most open minded,
the most liberal in the most 

2066
01:30:13,081 --> 01:30:16,470
progressive,
which I'm 100 percent for.

2067
01:30:16,860 --> 01:30:20,250
If women want to fight a transgender 
woman,

2068
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:21,113
if a woman wants to,
I think you should be able to ride 

2069
01:30:24,151 --> 01:30:26,550
bulls.
I think you should be able to sky dive.

2070
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:29,460
I think you should be able to do a 
fucking bungee jumping.

2071
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:30,294
I think you should do a lot.
You should be able to do a lot of 

2072
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:34,170
ridiculous,
crazy dangerous shit.

2073
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,450
You should be able to do flips with BMX 
bikes.

2074
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,100
Why shouldn't you be able to fight a 
man?

2075
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,233
Yeah.
Why shouldn't you be able to fight a 

2076
01:30:39,991 --> 01:30:42,270
transgender woman?
A woman that used to be a man.

2077
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:44,280
You shouldn't be able to.
If you're a man,

2078
01:30:44,550 --> 01:30:45,360
you're up for it.
Yeah.

2079
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,190
If you're a woman rather than your 130 
pounds,

2080
01:30:47,191 --> 01:30:49,860
you want to fight 130 pounds,
100 percent,

2081
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:50,521
man.
No,

2082
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:51,960
no transgender,
no nothing.

2083
01:30:51,961 --> 01:30:53,860
If you want to do that,
you should be out to.

2084
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:56,070
You should be allowed to.
I don't advise it.

2085
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,040
I think it's a terrible idea for you.
Yeah,

2086
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,153
you're going to get pummeled.
Well if it's a good fight or there's 

2087
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:02,783
just.

2088
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,200
What is this?
What's going on here?

2089
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:06,030
Bodybuilder.
We just show me.

2090
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,620
The article says,
this person can't decide to compete as a

2091
01:31:10,621 --> 01:31:12,630
man or a woman and this is what they 
look like.

2092
01:31:12,730 --> 01:31:15,420
They can't decide whether to compete as 
a man or a woman.

2093
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,220
That's what he used to look like on the 
left.

2094
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:19,320
Fucking a man and then,
oh my God,

2095
01:31:19,321 --> 01:31:23,010
he was super jacked and now he is on the
right,

2096
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,340
an easy trip,
but he looks like he's still.

2097
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:27,174
A man says he hasn't a Trans Trans 
transition yet still lives his life as 

2098
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:37,070
both he lives his life as both seeing.
This is where you're seeing that there's

2099
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:39,930
some of these fucking people have mental
illness,

2100
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:45,020
but there was an episode of radio lab 
where this one guy who's also a girl,

2101
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,673
um,
switches back and forth and under 

2102
01:31:48,481 --> 01:31:49,314
pressure.
He changes like he's Paul or ascending 

2103
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,560
and this is what on what radio lab so 
and,

2104
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:58,110
but radio lab is so fucking left wing 
and I love them.

2105
01:31:58,110 --> 01:31:58,943
They're amazing,
but they're so left wing and so 

2106
01:32:00,821 --> 01:32:03,510
progressive that they are unwilling to 
note and,

2107
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:04,423
and,
and even even address that pro postural 

2108
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,800
nature of this fucking person who's 
like,

2109
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:11,080
I just switched now.
I'm cindy right now.

2110
01:32:11,110 --> 01:32:14,170
Now I'm back to Paul.
Went back to Paul in the conversation in

2111
01:32:14,171 --> 01:32:16,510
the conversation like I just turned over
like,

2112
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:17,344
Oh,
you did?

2113
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,273
Oh,
you're this special creature that can 

2114
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:23,800
just go back and forth and switch 
genders or are you fucking crazy?

2115
01:32:23,801 --> 01:32:24,634
Paul Slash Cindy.
We would never have violated pages 

2116
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:30,250
wishes in the story.
It's an unfortunate understanding what,

2117
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:31,450
what he did.
He pulled up

2118
01:32:32,230 --> 01:32:33,063
when they had to change the whole story,
remember they had to go back because 

2119
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:39,330
they got mad that they as gendered them 
in their original.

2120
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,960
How did they miss gender?
If she goes back and forth,

2121
01:32:43,740 --> 01:32:48,740
they have to keep up at the moment.
So they mis-gendered.

2122
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:53,970
How were they called her?
A him or him or her?

2123
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:55,210
Which ones?
The mis-gendering

2124
01:32:55,460 --> 01:32:56,293
miscommunication was between the 
reporter and the actual person they're 

2125
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:00,330
talking to.

2126
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:02,190
Yeah,
the person's fucking crazy.

2127
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:06,210
You can't just go back and forth and 
back and forth like cut the shit.

2128
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:09,300
You know this.
This whole thing is just preposterous.

2129
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,790
Coming will remove references to the 
name.

2130
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:14,590
She no longer recognizes.
Does that mean that afterwards,

2131
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:17,010
afterwards she decided to go full 
female.

2132
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,370
That's what happened when you saw me 
Craig,

2133
01:33:19,371 --> 01:33:24,090
for a man.
So at one point in time during the show,

2134
01:33:24,091 --> 01:33:25,440
she's.
She switches like,

2135
01:33:25,441 --> 01:33:26,580
come on man.
Paul.

2136
01:33:26,581 --> 01:33:27,420
Now Paul.
Now,

2137
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:29,410
now back to Cindy.
Cindy.

2138
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:30,244
Cindy's light.
You can cindy's loose psychiatric help 

2139
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,980
at this point.
At one point in time we see.

2140
01:33:37,140 --> 01:33:37,973
Here's the thing,
you're not allowed to say that when it 

2141
01:33:39,931 --> 01:33:42,540
comes to gender,
when it comes to anything else,

2142
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:43,560
if you like,
oh,

2143
01:33:43,561 --> 01:33:45,810
I recognize it as a wood Elf.
I'm a Wood Elf,

2144
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,100
you know?
That's how I,

2145
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:51,000
that's how I identify a sprite should be
in the forest,

2146
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:52,650
flying around with the butterflies.

2147
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:53,760
Like people go,
Oh,

2148
01:33:53,761 --> 01:33:56,400
you probably has a housing issue because
schizophrenia.

2149
01:33:56,490 --> 01:33:58,650
Yeah.
But if it's a guy who's built like brock

2150
01:33:58,651 --> 01:34:00,450
Lesnar who's like,
you know,

2151
01:34:00,451 --> 01:34:05,190
I've always identified as Amanda,
small thin woman and people are like,

2152
01:34:05,191 --> 01:34:06,024
yeah,
who dance?

2153
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,040
Yeah,
you should respect that.

2154
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,390
Yeah,
we should respect that.

2155
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,720
When it comes to gender.
Gender is true.

2156
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,070
Weird thing that we allow all sorts of 
very illogical behavior.

2157
01:34:16,071 --> 01:34:16,891
Well,
yeah,

2158
01:34:16,891 --> 01:34:20,730
like these 78 plus gender step by the 
way.

2159
01:34:20,731 --> 01:34:23,040
They're adding more.
There's more like,

2160
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,123
there weren't enough.
There's more gender pronouns now than 

2161
01:34:26,761 --> 01:34:28,830
ever before.
Like if it's a guy at a bus stop,

2162
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,510
he was like,
I am the president.

2163
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:31,590
You don't go like,
oh,

2164
01:34:31,591 --> 01:34:33,420
we should respect the fuck out of that 
right now.

2165
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:34,321
Right.
You're just like,

2166
01:34:34,321 --> 01:34:35,154
oh man,
identifies as the leader of the free 

2167
01:34:35,821 --> 01:34:37,620
world.
You should address that.

2168
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:38,970
No,
you're supposed to be like,

2169
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,260
hey,
stand over here.

2170
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,180
Yeah.
When it comes to gender,

2171
01:34:42,181 --> 01:34:45,960
we're supposed to.
We give like a lot of leeway.

2172
01:34:46,210 --> 01:34:49,020
A let a lot of things slide.
Get us through.

2173
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,800
Yeah,
and I think it's for good reason.

2174
01:34:52,801 --> 01:34:53,634
I think the good part of it is that we 
recognize that there are people that 

2175
01:34:56,761 --> 01:34:57,594
really wish that they were a woman would
like you to call them a woman and why 

2176
01:35:01,881 --> 01:35:02,714
not let let the guy become a Gao and 
maybe there'll be happy that way and it 

2177
01:35:06,621 --> 01:35:09,680
shows,
I guess shows acceptance and kindness on

2178
01:35:09,681 --> 01:35:12,140
our part to just allow that to happen.
True.

2179
01:35:12,590 --> 01:35:17,590
But the problem with that is that 
goddamn slippery slope and a lot of this

2180
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:19,183
weirdness that's going on is people 
trying to control other people's 

2181
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:22,124
behavior and one of the ways they try to
do that is try to get you to use words 

2182
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:27,880
that they've made up.
Yeah.

2183
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:31,100
This is where you're seeing how 
preposterous it is.

2184
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:34,040
The level,
the number of pronouns is also 78.

2185
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:37,380
I mean until recently and somebody 
saying like,

2186
01:35:37,381 --> 01:35:39,540
I don't identify,
like I understand that concept,

2187
01:35:39,541 --> 01:35:40,374
it's not too hard to understand,
but where it's like I also have free 

2188
01:35:44,881 --> 01:35:49,881
reign on 100 words that you should 
possibly know to address me by.

2189
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:52,673
It's like,

2190
01:35:52,870 --> 01:35:55,210
what do you fucking.
Why are you bothering everybody?

2191
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:57,310
Know what it is that when you get off 
on,

2192
01:35:57,340 --> 01:36:00,730
would you become special that way?
Of course you get special rights,

2193
01:36:00,731 --> 01:36:04,360
special privileges,
special attention you get.

2194
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:07,060
It's just special consideration.

2195
01:36:08,090 --> 01:36:09,690
I'm trying to remember if my,
uh,

2196
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,590
yeah,
on my.

2197
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,081
Yeah.
Yeah.

2198
01:36:12,081 --> 01:36:12,914
I've,
I've had on my profile on twitter for a 

2199
01:36:14,691 --> 01:36:18,200
long time.
Like if you read my first bio says I'm a

2200
01:36:18,201 --> 01:36:21,680
comedian Comedians,
that's my pronouns.

2201
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:25,460
But nobody respects it.
Well,

2202
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:26,570
I didn't even know.
Zim.

2203
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:27,943
Zim is a big one.

2204
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:29,840
It's been,
I know zero Z,

2205
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,930
h e r or z e R.
Yeah.

2206
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:33,493
Yeah,
yeah.

2207
01:36:33,660 --> 01:36:37,140
Those are these motherfuckers.
There's just so many.

2208
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,960
What does it say?
We were really feeling dog cons.

2209
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:40,794
What does it say there?

2210
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:45,000
What does it say?
There were really feeling dog,

2211
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,863
constant want to thank the people of 
Australia for bringing it to our 

2212
01:36:47,671 --> 01:36:50,580
attention that we saw this clip or this 
guy,

2213
01:36:50,581 --> 01:36:54,270
if you hit view there.
He was like doing this video and we just

2214
01:36:54,271 --> 01:36:56,130
heard them say,
I've never heard somebody say that.

2215
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:57,263
He,
he.

2216
01:36:57,650 --> 01:36:59,250
Can you play it or no?
I don't know.

2217
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:00,383
He,
um,

2218
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,670
dog.
I like dogs.

2219
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:05,590
I've never heard.
I've never heard that before.

2220
01:37:05,591 --> 01:37:10,591
It's been really good.
He drinks a beer.

2221
01:37:10,621 --> 01:37:13,310
He's like dog and Australian guy were 
like,

2222
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,153
fucking a.
and then all these Australian people 

2223
01:37:15,961 --> 01:37:16,771
were like,
that's right.

2224
01:37:16,771 --> 01:37:17,604
That's one of the things we hear.
Like what does it mean that I actually 

2225
01:37:20,281 --> 01:37:24,240
got really great explanations of it,
uh,

2226
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:28,290
about how,
how common it is their only see this guy

2227
01:37:28,291 --> 01:37:30,510
wrote a,
well,

2228
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,710
first of the guy goes,
no,

2229
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:33,780
no problem.
That's how we talk here.

2230
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:38,940
A dog and Australia is like a dirty rat 
or an ugly person or a dishonest person.

2231
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,420
We use it to put people down.
So it's like,

2232
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:43,740
you know,
if somebody,

2233
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:47,340
you say dog a dog,
like as like a shitty person.

2234
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,030
Oh,
okay.

2235
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:49,710
So,
um,

2236
01:37:50,230 --> 01:37:52,440
so there's a lot of Shit cunts here too.

2237
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:59,640
I like Shit cunt.
He said it's to insults because dog is a

2238
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:00,680
common insult.
So don't.

2239
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:03,060
And this guy is a total.
This guy's a total bogan,

2240
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:07,950
which is a like a white trash redneck.
I'm now.

2241
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,130
The Guy said if you say you fucking dog,
come to the wrong type of Ozzy,

2242
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:12,143
you might get stabbed with a sharpened 
toothbrush multiple times and instead 

2243
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:18,080
it's a snitch in Bogan slang.
So a dog can,

2244
01:38:18,081 --> 01:38:21,330
such as a snitch.
A dog con is a snitch.

2245
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:25,500
So Matt Kahn is a good bloke.
Sick cunt is a,

2246
01:38:25,710 --> 01:38:29,030
like a professional bmx rider of Fatca 
is burt.

2247
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:32,850
I'm a dog kinds of shitty person.
Oh,

2248
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:35,880
if you see your mate,
he ditches you for a girl on a night out

2249
01:38:35,881 --> 01:38:38,750
and he's a fucking dog cut.
Uh,

2250
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:41,550
yeah.
If you see your mate,

2251
01:38:41,640 --> 01:38:45,330
your buddy pitches you for a gal to 
fucking dog.

2252
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:47,400
God,
what's he supposed to do?

2253
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,830
Like what if he can get laid?
Supposed to hang out with you,

2254
01:38:49,831 --> 01:38:50,664
man.
You guys had plans certain point in 

2255
01:38:52,681 --> 01:38:55,230
time.
Like what if she's really hot like that?

2256
01:38:55,231 --> 01:38:58,020
Changes everything.
If she's super,

2257
01:38:58,021 --> 01:39:00,240
she wants to get hot banging out right 
now.

2258
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:02,400
And your friends being a dog for getting
upset at you.

2259
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:03,560
I think.
Hm.

2260
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,240
Interesting.
Okay,

2261
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:07,000
interesting.
You know what's in.

2262
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:07,933
I don't know where I came up with her.
I'm having a hard time pulling hot 

2263
01:39:10,141 --> 01:39:10,974
chicks names for references on the fly.
The other day I said Jennifer beal from 

2264
01:39:15,161 --> 01:39:16,650
flash dance.
It's like where?

2265
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:19,320
What payment in this special place in 
your mind.

2266
01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:21,150
That's I guess.
Yeah,

2267
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:22,123
I think we all go to like an era.
I wouldn't do that to be that fucking 

2268
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:27,150
Kathy Ireland smoke show.
Oh yeah,

2269
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,430
yeah.
She's like 80 now.

2270
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,930
Yeah,
but that's because there was a time when

2271
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:32,430
I was really stroking to her.

2272
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:33,740
Were you proud?
Yeah,

2273
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:34,613
I mean I'm sure when that sports 
illustrated was coming out I was 

2274
01:39:36,601 --> 01:39:39,330
probably like 13 or something,
so yeah,

2275
01:39:39,331 --> 01:39:42,060
that would have been prime time for all 
that era.

2276
01:39:42,110 --> 01:39:44,100
It's was like when you discover what a 
hot woman is,

2277
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:48,510
when did you discover what a woman is?
She's like someone's mom now.

2278
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:50,160
No,
definitely Pearson.

2279
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:51,760
That's what she used to look like.
Yeah.

2280
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:52,613
So that right there,
it's got to be so hard for those women 

2281
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:57,240
to let that go.
Yeah.

2282
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:58,870
And to be that hot.
Yeah.

2283
01:39:58,930 --> 01:39:59,763
Celebrated for it.
And now to be just like a regular old 

2284
01:40:02,851 --> 01:40:06,060
Nice lady with price.
Nice Gal.

2285
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:09,720
Someone's mom.
Yeah.

2286
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,200
I think the thing about the ski stuff 
with the sports,

2287
01:40:12,201 --> 01:40:13,034
with when the swimsuit issue would come 
out is that they were kind of household 

2288
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:17,424
names and kind of not.
So you felt like you knew something by 

2289
01:40:19,321 --> 01:40:20,154
learning their name.

2290
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:22,590
Do you know what I mean?
Like because it wasn't a movie star,

2291
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:26,970
a swimsuit model was like learning that 
name.

2292
01:40:26,971 --> 01:40:27,804
I'm talking about like as a teenager in 
a bizarre way you thought like he knew 

2293
01:40:31,801 --> 01:40:33,840
them better because you knew their name,
you know,

2294
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:36,150
so like I would be like Oh Kathy 
Ireland,

2295
01:40:36,151 --> 01:40:38,910
Elle Macpherson,
and then people would catch on.

2296
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,820
But you'd learn their names and feel 
like you knew something.

2297
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:43,080
I don't know.
It's really weird.

2298
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:43,771
Really?
Yeah,

2299
01:40:43,771 --> 01:40:44,604
I think so.
Like you were better than people that 

2300
01:40:45,451 --> 01:40:48,420
didn't know their names.
I think at 12 and 13 definitely.

2301
01:40:48,570 --> 01:40:52,130
Was it like a sports thing?
It's like knowing stats like six,

2302
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:52,980
nine,
2:45,

2303
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,040
you can really fucking movement.

2304
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:58,060
You feel like you know more.
Yeah.

2305
01:40:58,061 --> 01:40:58,894
That was always a thing.
Right when you were young to be able to 

2306
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:05,320
pull out sports stats and players' names
to know the entire lineup.

2307
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:09,360
It's really crazy.
I know I saw this thing a already lange.

2308
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:10,243
Do you know that he can name for like 40
years who played in world series and 

2309
01:41:15,221 --> 01:41:16,054
like like the two teams that played,
but I'm talking about you can be like 

2310
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:19,054
1958 and he's like,
that was cardinals versus mets game for 

2311
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,530
this happy.
Like he knows he knows like a span of 40

2312
01:41:26,531 --> 01:41:29,320
or 50 years by memory.
Wow.

2313
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:31,810
That's some,
that's some really,

2314
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:36,700
really ridiculous stats to know what.
He's a fucking banana baseball fan.

2315
01:41:36,730 --> 01:41:39,220
Yeah.
But this level of it is really.

2316
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:41,050
I've never seen anything like that 
before.

2317
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:44,350
Why doesn't he do like sports radio 
then?

2318
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,670
He did for awhile,
didn't he?

2319
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:47,620
He did.
He did with Nick Depaulo.

2320
01:41:47,621 --> 01:41:50,080
Wasn't that like a sports radio show?
I'm not sure.

2321
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,880
I'm not sure.
I know.

2322
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:52,930
What is he doing now?
He,

2323
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:54,880
he checked himself into Rehab,
right?

2324
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:56,163
Um,
I think so because he was doing that 

2325
01:41:57,281 --> 01:42:02,281
show with Anthony and then I think he 
checked himself into Rehab.

2326
01:42:02,501 --> 01:42:03,460
I think so,
yeah.

2327
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,100
Which is good.
Yeah.

2328
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:07,740
He just did it.
He did that last,

2329
01:42:07,741 --> 01:42:08,574
uh,
or the new season of crashing the HBO 

2330
01:42:09,941 --> 01:42:11,080
show.
Pete Holmes show.

2331
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:13,660
He's one of the guests or one of the 
stars.

2332
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:15,030
He's one of.
He's a cast member I think.

2333
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:17,980
I think so because he was on it the 
first season and yeah,

2334
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:21,280
he returned for guy.
He loves the drugs.

2335
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,020
Yeah.
And the hard ones.

2336
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:24,880
He's a true addict.
Yeah.

2337
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:25,773
Yeah.
Yeah.

2338
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:28,690
Like you gotta wonder.
He's so funny though.

2339
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:30,450
It's hilarious.
And that's a,

2340
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:32,120
like I said,
that that sports analogy has,

2341
01:42:32,121 --> 01:42:33,550
is fucking crazy.

2342
01:42:34,390 --> 01:42:35,223
Do you have sports knowledge?
You have a lot of sports knowledge now 

2343
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:40,180
that I know some,
some random things,

2344
01:42:40,430 --> 01:42:42,540
you know,
I know some things like,

2345
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:43,900
I mean I basically,
like I said,

2346
01:42:43,901 --> 01:42:45,940
I like college football and so like I 
can,

2347
01:42:46,300 --> 01:42:51,300
I can hold a conversation with different
levels of college football fans.

2348
01:42:51,461 --> 01:42:52,294
Like I could,
I could talk to a super fan and hang 

2349
01:42:54,101 --> 01:42:54,934
with them in that conversation,
but I'm not like I can tell you every 

2350
01:42:59,171 --> 01:43:01,090
championship game for the last 20.
No,

2351
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,073
no.
I remember people team's winning and 

2352
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:05,260
stuff for sure.
But I don't,

2353
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:10,280
I don't have a level that you'd be like,
what type of autism do you have?

2354
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:11,343
Like that is like,
so like savant level shit where it's 

2355
01:43:13,691 --> 01:43:16,630
like you're such an expert in one field.
You know,

2356
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:19,630
like all these weird stats you retain.
Well not like that.

2357
01:43:20,260 --> 01:43:21,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

2358
01:43:21,930 --> 01:43:25,960
Just you ever see a Al Franken draw the 
United States like that?

2359
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:27,303
No.
He's got this weird ability to draw 

2360
01:43:28,990 --> 01:43:33,880
every state that he went all 50 states.
He draws the shape of them,

2361
01:43:33,970 --> 01:43:36,030
puts it together in the,
in the.

2362
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,580
He draws the United States by freehand.
Really?

2363
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:42,940
Yeah.
That's his ability to do that.

2364
01:43:42,941 --> 01:43:43,980
Like,
like this.

2365
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:47,560
Look at this.
This is before everybody knew he grabbed

2366
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:50,830
butts.
That's already impressive.

2367
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:51,733
Just that.

2368
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,873
Yeah.
I know he does the entire country 

2369
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:58,910
completely freehand and it's an accurate
map of the country.

2370
01:43:59,360 --> 01:44:00,710
How is this possible?
Well,

2371
01:44:00,711 --> 01:44:04,490
because he's a real patriot.
This is one of the things that's kind of

2372
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:08,390
disturbing and sad about the whole Al 
Franken thing.

2373
01:44:08,690 --> 01:44:09,523
The worst they got out of him was that 
he may or may not have grabbed 

2374
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:16,990
someone's,
but when he took pictures with him,

2375
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:21,260
I don't know if he did or he didn't,
but this is basically it.

2376
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,240
Incredible.
And he's resigning.

2377
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,840
He's not going to be a senator.
I know he's done and.

2378
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:30,080
But they didn't get them on anything 
like completely horrible.

2379
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:31,333
I was just like,
he may or may not have squirrels in 

2380
01:44:34,011 --> 01:44:38,480
someone's butt.
A few people's butts.

2381
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:40,840
How many fives?
A few butts.

2382
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,950
A few buts.
Few bought like five or six.

2383
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,680
That's really impressive actually.
Yeah.

2384
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:47,830
It was very impressive and that means.

2385
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:50,290
Yeah,
I mean,

2386
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:53,580
does California the whole deal look,
come on others,

2387
01:44:53,630 --> 01:44:57,120
even as Alaska and Hawaii,
they do the state tomorrow.

2388
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:02,070
Two thousand.
Yeah.

2389
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:06,050
Well he was all high on his performance.
He just was feeling,

2390
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:08,810
I'm the fucking King of the world.
I can see how it could happen.

2391
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:09,883
I had my butt grabbed the bunch.
We're taking pictures of the women for 

2392
01:45:12,291 --> 01:45:13,071
sure.
After shows.

2393
01:45:13,071 --> 01:45:14,150
Yeah,
I never got.

2394
01:45:14,160 --> 01:45:14,840
I'm like,
Nah,

2395
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:16,040
that's just not.
I don't do it,

2396
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:17,053
but I could see how people's butts 
woodcut grabbed bill byrd was talking 

2397
01:45:19,131 --> 01:45:20,330
about on this podcast.
I was like,

2398
01:45:20,331 --> 01:45:22,640
this is a particular type of woman in 
her forties,

2399
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:24,740
drunk,
a little loud,

2400
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:27,640
getting kind of crazy and there's the 
ones going to grab your eye,

2401
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:31,220
grab your ass.
They'll say like a can.

2402
01:45:31,221 --> 01:45:32,054
I mentioned nipple or.
And they'll say something and then 

2403
01:45:34,131 --> 01:45:37,040
before you could even say no,
they're going for it.

2404
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:37,874
Go for it.

2405
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:41,780
And they're always boozed up.
They're never like,

2406
01:45:41,781 --> 01:45:43,490
yeah,
that's always alcohol.

2407
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:44,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

2408
01:45:44,811 --> 01:45:49,220
Alcohol is the catalyst for all shitty 
behavior and decision making.

2409
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,560
By the way,
did you see that born strong doc?

2410
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:52,423
You see that born strong?
Is this documentary about the world's 

2411
01:45:56,301 --> 01:45:57,980
strongest man competition?
No.

2412
01:45:58,220 --> 01:46:03,220
It's really fucking interesting.
Men and these guys are such fucking like

2413
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:07,850
not normal species of human.
You know?

2414
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:08,743
I was like the Iceland guys.
They're doing those power lifting 

2415
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:11,624
competition and they do it like that.
It goes to the arnold classic every 

2416
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:15,100
year,
and these guys,

2417
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:19,160
these guys are such fucking beast,
man.

2418
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:23,150
I mean it is like it.
It's not.

2419
01:46:23,270 --> 01:46:26,930
I mean this doesn't.
1,100 pound deadlift watts.

2420
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:28,340
Yeah.
Eddie,

2421
01:46:28,341 --> 01:46:30,860
six foot to 400 pounds.
Yeah.

2422
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:35,780
These so unhealthy for you to be that.
But that guy is interesting.

2423
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:39,560
He was a national champion swimmer.
Wow.

2424
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:40,610
Yeah.
As a kid,

2425
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,420
like a thin guy.
Yes.

2426
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:46,100
Lean and thin and he,
he's competing against guys.

2427
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:50,180
Most of the guys he competes against are
like a that guys,

2428
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,770
the next smallest.
Basically everyone,

2429
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,300
all the other guys were like six,
eight,

2430
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:55,710
six,
nine,

2431
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:56,770
four,
10,

2432
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:58,170
four,
24:30.

2433
01:46:59,040 --> 01:46:59,720
And the,
the,

2434
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:04,720
the swimmer guy has to eat like all day 
and they explained the physiology.

2435
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:06,780
Look at that size of that guy.
Six,

2436
01:47:06,781 --> 01:47:07,381
eight,
four,

2437
01:47:07,381 --> 01:47:11,700
27.
I mean they're just Jesus Christ.

2438
01:47:11,730 --> 01:47:15,420
So they're so crazy.
But this level of competition is.

2439
01:47:15,450 --> 01:47:17,430
This is the guy from game of thrones 
right here.

2440
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:18,773
He's a competitor too,
but it's like the physiology of I'm 

2441
01:47:24,210 --> 01:47:29,210
eating that much to sustain the muscle.
Eventually you have to put on the weight

2442
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:35,550
like the you need the fat and they 
explained how,

2443
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:38,850
you know,
this is like his physique is like that.

2444
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:40,133
He's just kind of put together that way,
but most of the guys have these big 

2445
01:47:42,901 --> 01:47:43,734
barrel bellies and a doctor explains how
at a certain level of consumption the 

2446
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:53,670
these guys all basically get Belize,
you know,

2447
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:55,740
like because people are like why do they
have to get fat?

2448
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:56,573
And just as you think that they start 
explaining it so when you're that big 

2449
01:48:00,031 --> 01:48:02,310
and you lifting that much weight,
you have to be fast.

2450
01:48:02,311 --> 01:48:04,140
Yes.
That's basically what the guy says.

2451
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:07,030
But the game of thrones guys,
not really that far,

2452
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:07,883
but I think it's for,
but he's one of the unique cases where 

2453
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:16,620
he is actually built to be a fucking 
viking.

2454
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:17,483
In other words,
the other guys are eating so much to 

2455
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:22,313
sustain themselves,
be able to pick up and recover from all 

2456
01:48:25,651 --> 01:48:26,484
this crazy weight lifting.
He's a guy who is essentially born 

2457
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:31,320
walking around six,
eight,

2458
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,580
three 95 or whatever the like.
He's a unique freak,

2459
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:39,180
huh?
The other guys have to eat crazy amounts

2460
01:48:39,181 --> 01:48:39,961
of food.
I mean,

2461
01:48:39,961 --> 01:48:42,510
they show what one of these guys.
It would blow your mind.

2462
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:46,860
He forced feeds himself like nine times 
a day and he has to.

2463
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:47,930
He said he has to.
Yeah.

2464
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,690
And has he ever tried to not do it and 
see if he's less strong?

2465
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,220
I think so.
Yeah.

2466
01:48:53,250 --> 01:48:55,020
I think so.
After the force feeding yourself,

2467
01:48:55,021 --> 01:48:56,490
make yourself stronger.
Yeah.

2468
01:48:56,760 --> 01:48:58,590
Yeah.
It really is interesting.

2469
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:01,650
I mean like why?
Why do you get stronger if you're fatter

2470
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:03,403
or do you need that much food to keep 
the muscles up and if you just eat that 

2471
01:49:06,451 --> 01:49:07,284
much food to keep the muscles up,
there's going to be a certain amount of 

2472
01:49:08,641 --> 01:49:09,710
fat that's kind of.
Yeah,

2473
01:49:09,711 --> 01:49:12,030
I think that's more of the,
the way it goes.

2474
01:49:12,180 --> 01:49:14,520
They talk about steroids.
Um,

2475
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:15,510
no,
not really.

2476
01:49:15,511 --> 01:49:18,860
No bullshit documentary then.
I don't feel like they did fucking guys.

2477
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:19,710
No one,
no one.

2478
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:22,800
No one wants to admit it.
That's a weird thing about that world.

2479
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:24,650
That's this swimmer guy.
Look at him.

2480
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:26,640
Wow.
He was all lean and yeah.

2481
01:49:27,510 --> 01:49:29,010
Gay Porno with.
Yeah.

2482
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:33,030
Not that he was,
I'm just saying if you were going to,

2483
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:34,303
there was a film about a guy working out
in the backyard and a bunch of guys 

2484
01:49:36,481 --> 01:49:40,630
showed up to suck his dick.
That'd be the guy didn't even believe it

2485
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:41,563
was real life.
The fact that one of those guys could 

2486
01:49:44,341 --> 01:49:48,490
just become a woman and just enter into 
women's weightlifting competitions,

2487
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:50,370
so it would be respectful,
don't.

2488
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:51,413
Yeah,
the path.

2489
01:49:51,490 --> 01:49:53,280
She's a woman.
She's always been a woman.

2490
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:54,333
God,
she beat the competition by an 

2491
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:58,720
astounding 600 pounds.
Really crazy.

2492
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:01,630
Yeah.
Beat the second runner up by 40 pounds.

2493
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:03,320
No big deal.
It's normal.

2494
01:50:03,580 --> 01:50:05,980
Super Normal.
That happens.

2495
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:07,810
Yeah.
No everybody does it.

2496
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:09,930
No,
no.

2497
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:12,180
We're going to look back on these days 
and it's gonna.

2498
01:50:12,181 --> 01:50:13,014
It's gonna.
Be An astounding sort of observation on 

2499
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:20,103
mass mass thinking like group.
Think like what happens when people are 

2500
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:24,484
scared of expressing themselves honestly
and in expressing controversial points 

2501
01:50:29,771 --> 01:50:31,330
of view because of the time and the 
culture,

2502
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:33,880
like what it.
You know what,

2503
01:50:33,881 --> 01:50:36,310
what ramifications it has.
By the way,

2504
01:50:36,311 --> 01:50:37,360
here's.
Here's what's weird.

2505
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:39,910
I'm an.
I don't know if it's good or bad.

2506
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:41,620
It's not a judgment call,
but I am.

2507
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:47,070
I know so many people whose children are
now transgender a lot.

2508
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:49,630
Yeah,
like five or six where I didn't know any

2509
01:50:49,631 --> 01:50:51,940
before,
like when I was growing up.

2510
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,360
All in California.
Yeah.

2511
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:55,720
Well one of them in Canada,
but yeah,

2512
01:50:56,050 --> 01:51:00,100
really important.
What's this Toronto theories?

2513
01:51:00,490 --> 01:51:01,323
Jessica plot is A.
CW has first openly transgender player 

2514
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:06,213
now.
She used to be a woman and now as a man 

2515
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:11,140
used to be a man now as a woman and 
she's playing women's hockey.

2516
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,030
Okay.
Fuck that.

2517
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,510
That's crazy.
You know,

2518
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:16,670
five people.
Yeah.

2519
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:19,260
Talky get's.
It was an all star this year.

2520
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:20,450
Jessica.
Yeah.

2521
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:22,450
Take.
Take that fucking mountain from the game

2522
01:51:22,451 --> 01:51:23,590
of thrones.
Put them in a skirt.

2523
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:27,670
Only people he plows over like God damn 
human bowling ball.

2524
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,280
Oh my God.
That's so funny.

2525
01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:34,450
It's just if you're going to play 
sports,

2526
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:36,640
there should be.
Look,

2527
01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:38,980
there are physical freaks that are 
women.

2528
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:39,873
There's no doubt about that.
There's some women that are just 

2529
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:44,350
physical freaks and there's some women 
that also take steroids.

2530
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:45,383
That's,
that's another very controversial issue 

2531
01:51:46,901 --> 01:51:51,520
because you have women that are 
ingesting large amounts of male hormones

2532
01:51:51,521 --> 01:51:54,880
and changing their physiology and then 
they also compete against women,

2533
01:51:56,920 --> 01:51:58,730
but then there's women or just women.
Yeah.

2534
01:51:58,810 --> 01:52:00,970
What about them?
How about looking out for them?

2535
01:52:01,150 --> 01:52:01,983
How about not letting them get their 
head smashed in fairview and this comes 

2536
01:52:05,441 --> 01:52:06,550
down to.
It's not fair,

2537
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,500
but it's also,
it's just.

2538
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:09,873
It just shows you how silly people have 
gotten and about how weird we are about 

2539
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:19,480
looking at things and that everyone is 
so and it because they don't have.

2540
01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:21,430
They don't really have a personal stake 
in the game.

2541
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:23,223
Everyone is so concerned about being 
viewed as being incredibly progressive 

2542
01:52:26,561 --> 01:52:27,750
and open minded.
Yeah.

2543
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:31,030
That they don't want to criticize.
It's really interesting point because if

2544
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:35,140
you really put yourself in a competition
you care about say like,

2545
01:52:35,141 --> 01:52:35,974
it's important to you to imagine 
yourself competing in something where 

2546
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:43,411
it's important to you to when they go,
but they we're going to have this person

2547
01:52:43,721 --> 01:52:45,740
in and those are the circumstances you 
would.

2548
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,240
You'd be the first one.
It'd be like,

2549
01:52:47,241 --> 01:52:48,600
fuck that.
Yeah,

2550
01:52:48,650 --> 01:52:51,740
that is not fair,
and those women get called bigots.

2551
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:52,611
Yeah,
it gets.

2552
01:52:52,611 --> 01:52:54,040
It's really strange.
Yeah,

2553
01:52:54,041 --> 01:52:54,874
that is very straight.
Those women get attacked online like a 

2554
01:52:57,231 --> 01:52:58,064
bunch of women that didn't want to fight
that transgender man who became a woman 

2555
01:53:01,570 --> 01:53:05,480
in mma and they got called bigots and 
transphobia and that and the transgender

2556
01:53:05,481 --> 01:53:06,314
people.
That community is like super aggressive 

2557
01:53:09,021 --> 01:53:12,500
about defending that intellectual turf,
defending that idea.

2558
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:13,363
See,
that's an interesting place is work 

2559
01:53:14,850 --> 01:53:15,683
where you go because you have to have 
empathy for let's say this transgender 

2560
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:20,810
person who's like,
I want to compete,

2561
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:21,620
and you're like,
yeah,

2562
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:24,590
you should be able to compete,
but how is.

2563
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:28,040
How is this circumstance fair to both 
sides?

2564
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:29,023
You know,
to those women that that are really 

2565
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:32,323
wanting attention.
Part of part of the wanting to compete 

2566
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:35,264
is also wanting attention and wanting 
everyone to know that you're a man or 

2567
01:53:38,661 --> 01:53:41,390
transition to a woman and that there's,
look,

2568
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:43,700
there's a lot of energy in that.

2569
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:44,623
There's a lot of people that are paying 
attention to that and and anybody who 

2570
01:53:47,061 --> 01:53:48,590
says no,
that's preposterous.

2571
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:50,930
People,
they want their privacy when it comes to

2572
01:53:50,931 --> 01:53:51,764
these matters and they they're not.
They don't want to be open to the 

2573
01:53:53,901 --> 01:53:57,130
ridicule bullshit bullshit.
They,

2574
01:53:57,180 --> 01:53:59,300
they're,
they want attention 100 percent.

2575
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,310
That's why they're competing with what 
they're doing.

2576
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:05,180
It's why they're letting everybody know 
that the first openly transgender woman.

2577
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:06,223
It's a lot of this is about.
I mean some of it is about transgender 

2578
01:54:09,051 --> 01:54:09,884
rights.
It's about transparency and showing 

2579
01:54:11,121 --> 01:54:13,120
people how many of those folks are out 
there.

2580
01:54:13,121 --> 01:54:16,100
I'm sure a lot of it's about horseshit.
Yeah,

2581
01:54:16,101 --> 01:54:17,750
there's a lot of attention.
A lot of it.

2582
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:18,643
I mean for you to sign up for that 
competition when you know what's what 

2583
01:54:22,430 --> 01:54:26,570
wildly attention getting,
especially things like power lifting and

2584
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:30,890
mma,
like to deny that there's some sort of a

2585
01:54:30,891 --> 01:54:32,120
difference in the male frame.

2586
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:33,103
There's also a lot of horseshit when it 
comes to like what actually happens to 

2587
01:54:35,721 --> 01:54:40,430
the body during transition and how much 
strength you lose and how much bone mass

2588
01:54:40,431 --> 01:54:45,140
you lose and there's a woman named Dr 
Ramona crushed sick.

2589
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:46,003
I think that's her name and they 
interviewed her and she's one of the 

2590
01:54:47,541 --> 01:54:48,374
very few people that's been interviewed 
about this as an actual endocrinologist 

2591
01:54:51,321 --> 01:54:56,321
that's not a gender transition doctor 
does.

2592
01:54:57,110 --> 01:54:57,943
That's what a lot of them are.
A lot of the people that talk about 

2593
01:54:59,541 --> 01:55:00,374
these things and have these,
these discussions about these things 

2594
01:55:02,811 --> 01:55:06,920
that are hashtag experts,
they're actually transitioned doctors so

2595
01:55:06,921 --> 01:55:07,754
they have a vested interest in sort of 
expressing the ideology that there's no 

2596
01:55:13,761 --> 01:55:17,080
physical advantage and that these women,
you know,

2597
01:55:17,660 --> 01:55:18,493
they once they have been under these 
hormonal treatments for x amount of 

2598
01:55:21,561 --> 01:55:22,394
years,
they become physiologically a woman and 

2599
01:55:24,261 --> 01:55:27,350
there's no distinction between them and 
a biological woman.

2600
01:55:27,830 --> 01:55:29,660
But this one woman doctor Ramona 
critique,

2601
01:55:29,770 --> 01:55:33,560
she wrote an article for,
I want to say it was.

2602
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,430
It was either SB nation or bloody elbow.
I forget what it was,

2603
01:55:37,431 --> 01:55:39,350
but they interviewed her and she was 
saying,

2604
01:55:39,351 --> 01:55:40,184
not only do you not lose bone density,
but you maintain it because you're 

2605
01:55:43,111 --> 01:55:44,970
taking estrogen.
And she's like,

2606
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:45,833
well,
the the is that a man has more bone 

2607
01:55:47,281 --> 01:55:48,240
density.
They're thicker,

2608
01:55:48,241 --> 01:55:51,750
they're built different,
and that you would lose a lot of that in

2609
01:55:51,751 --> 01:55:52,584
your transition to being a woman,
but you don't lose the bone density 

2610
01:55:54,661 --> 01:55:55,494
because estrogen is actually what causes
people to maintain their bone density 

2611
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:01,710
when they're older,
when they're women,

2612
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,903
like that's one of the things that 
happens to women when they get older to 

2613
01:56:04,301 --> 01:56:05,134
get osteoporosis.
What part of the problem is that your 

2614
01:56:07,830 --> 01:56:08,663
body doesn't produce as much estrogen as
it used to and so you have a lack of 

2615
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:11,910
bone density.

2616
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:12,743
One way to heighten that it's to 
supplement with estrogen interested 

2617
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:19,740
actually maintains bone density.
So it's a good argument,

2618
01:56:19,860 --> 01:56:23,820
but they're not the same as men because 
they don't have testosterone anymore.

2619
01:56:24,050 --> 01:56:26,190
And if they're not taking exogenous 
testosterone,

2620
01:56:26,191 --> 01:56:27,990
they're definitely a have a disadvantage
against men,

2621
01:56:28,260 --> 01:56:30,440
but they still would have an advantage 
against men about,

2622
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:32,610
against women rather than mechanical 
advantage,

2623
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:35,310
of course.
But that's also a mental advantage.

2624
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:40,340
There's a reaction advantage.
The reaction time is quicker with,

2625
01:56:40,350 --> 01:56:41,880
uh,
with men than with women.

2626
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:42,714
Like there's a bunch of weird three d 
space recognition advantages that men 

2627
01:56:47,071 --> 01:56:47,904
have.
And then there's the thing that people 

2628
01:56:50,011 --> 01:56:52,410
want to pretend that there's no 
difference between men and women.

2629
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:54,630
There's that group,
that group.

2630
01:56:54,660 --> 01:56:55,493
No,
but that seems like so stupid to even 

2631
01:56:57,331 --> 01:56:59,080
entertain the idea.
No,

2632
01:56:59,140 --> 01:56:59,973
that's.
This is a common thing among the most 

2633
01:57:01,501 --> 01:57:02,334
ridiculous of the progressives is that 
there's no biological difference in the 

2634
01:57:05,131 --> 01:57:05,964
sexes.

2635
01:57:06,480 --> 01:57:07,313
What?
Wha,

2636
01:57:08,340 --> 01:57:12,930
how could anything dumb,
but it is dumb,

2637
01:57:13,170 --> 01:57:18,170
but it shows you how insane a lot of 
this thinking is,

2638
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:19,853
is that this group think this mass 
progressive thought process that they 

2639
01:57:24,061 --> 01:57:24,894
just accept things that they're totally 
irrational and then repeat them as ad 

2640
01:57:28,171 --> 01:57:29,004
nauseum.
Like we played this one clip where 

2641
01:57:30,361 --> 01:57:31,194
there's,
it seems like as a transgender man to a 

2642
01:57:33,961 --> 01:57:34,794
woman to man who's saying she was 
talking was Jordan Peterson debate and 

2643
01:57:39,901 --> 01:57:42,390
she was saying there's no biological 
difference between the Saxon.

2644
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:44,820
I'd be happy to unpack that for you.
Oh really?

2645
01:57:45,090 --> 01:57:48,090
Oh,
you'd be happy to unpack biology.

2646
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:49,013
Sure.
And just no difference at all in our 

2647
01:57:51,301 --> 01:57:54,040
biology is now it's not real.
Okay.

2648
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:57,830
There's no biological basis and sex in 
general.

2649
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:01,380
What did I say?
This is an expert.

2650
01:58:01,381 --> 01:58:02,340
Dig It.
Yes.

2651
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:03,910
I'm sorry,
he transphobic.

2652
01:58:03,930 --> 01:58:05,880
Are you a bigot?
Is this an this is an expert?

2653
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:07,950
No,
but she's teaching at a college.

2654
01:58:08,050 --> 01:58:08,520
Oh,
that's.

2655
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:09,310
Yeah,
that would follow,

2656
01:58:09,310 --> 01:58:10,950
but that's what a lot of good lots going
on.

2657
01:58:10,980 --> 01:58:13,290
There's a lot of that going on in 
colleges where people are teaching.

2658
01:58:13,291 --> 01:58:16,320
Unbelievably ridiculous shit.
I got to go right buddy.

2659
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:18,090
Go for it.
Oh my God,

2660
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:19,170
Dah,
Dah.

2661
01:58:19,830 --> 01:58:20,663
Tommy buns.
As done the three hour podcasts and 

2662
01:58:22,031 --> 01:58:25,220
while it doesn't have the kind of 
bladder for it too,

2663
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:27,210
by the way,
we can go live with that.

2664
01:58:27,211 --> 01:58:29,010
Just go,
oh well it's too late.

2665
01:58:29,330 --> 01:58:31,860
We'll go live with tyron.
When he comes in earlier later,

2666
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:34,320
people were parking in front of our 
garage again.

2667
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:37,710
Fuck heads.
So young.

2668
01:58:37,711 --> 01:58:38,544
Jamie.
This game that Tommy Buns and Ari 

2669
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,353
Shaffir and Bert Kreischer went to.
This was the game that you were 

2670
01:58:45,161 --> 01:58:46,090
interested in as well.

2671
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:47,870
I was watching it.
It was actually a really,

2672
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:49,010
really good game.
They were.

2673
01:58:49,160 --> 01:58:52,610
They took the side of Georgia who turned
out to not be the victors,

2674
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:53,473
but the final five minutes of the game 
was insane and you as non football fan 

2675
01:58:57,531 --> 01:58:59,000
could probably watch it and enjoy it 
too.

2676
01:58:59,150 --> 01:58:59,983
Really?
Yeah.

2677
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:02,550
Now let me ask you this because this is 
what I was going to ask.

2678
01:59:02,640 --> 01:59:03,473
Is there any other sport like football 
that has the kind of attention on the 

2679
01:59:06,931 --> 01:59:07,764
college level because it.
Does basketball have that kind of 

2680
01:59:11,551 --> 01:59:14,580
attention to people care as much about a
championship game in March,

2681
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:16,080
in March,
March madness.

2682
01:59:16,130 --> 01:59:18,090
Oh,
that's what my marketed thing,

2683
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:19,050
but not baseball.

2684
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:20,250
Baseball.
No,

2685
01:59:20,250 --> 01:59:21,820
no.
They do have a college world series,

2686
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:24,250
but nobody gives a fuck about that 
summer when no one's paying attention.

2687
01:59:24,470 --> 01:59:25,303
Hmm.

2688
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:28,340
But that's it.
As far as in terms of other sports,

2689
01:59:28,341 --> 01:59:29,720
right?
I mean there's no other ones.

2690
01:59:30,490 --> 01:59:31,390
Yeah.
I was just trying to think.

2691
01:59:31,391 --> 01:59:34,120
Wrestling as well,
got a little attention,

2692
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:34,954
but it's very small,
but in their world they sell out arenas 

2693
01:59:37,961 --> 01:59:39,430
and whatnot.
It's just not televised.

2694
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,850
Right.
But in wrestling it's really only other.

2695
01:59:43,060 --> 01:59:43,893
I mean,
it's like wrestling fans that are into 

2696
01:59:45,731 --> 01:59:47,110
it and you're not a national thing

2697
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:47,973
given that knife.
I'm pretty sure not every college has a 

2698
01:59:49,841 --> 01:59:50,674
wrestling team,
just like they almost all have a 

2699
01:59:52,391 --> 01:59:54,430
football team.
Almost all have a basketball team.

2700
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,500
They don't all have wrestling team.

2701
01:59:57,240 --> 01:59:57,931
Yeah.
You know,

2702
01:59:57,931 --> 01:59:59,490
one of the things that we're 
highlighting,

2703
01:59:59,491 --> 02:00:00,900
I was reading this article about,
um,

2704
02:00:01,050 --> 02:00:01,883
the coaches and about how the coaches 
were getting these large bonuses for 

2705
02:00:05,251 --> 02:00:07,190
victory.
And uh,

2706
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:07,831
they were,
it was,

2707
02:00:07,831 --> 02:00:11,850
they were saying how crazy it is that 
the kids that are playing aren't getting

2708
02:00:11,851 --> 02:00:12,684
any money,
but that these fucking coaches are 

2709
02:00:14,641 --> 02:00:19,641
making shit tons of money and that the 
university prophets massively from these

2710
02:00:20,571 --> 02:00:21,404
successful football programs and yet 
these athletes who are damaging their 

2711
02:00:25,351 --> 02:00:26,184
brain,
damaging their body and then a large 

2712
02:00:28,111 --> 02:00:28,944
percentage of them are never even going 
to go onto a career in professional 

2713
02:00:31,981 --> 02:00:32,814
sports.

2714
02:00:33,090 --> 02:00:36,480
So I'm pulling this up,
this now here's another pop up.

2715
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:37,400
But,
um,

2716
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:38,663
this summer,
I think it was right before the 

2717
02:00:40,441 --> 02:00:43,440
basketball season started this a 
scandal.

2718
02:00:43,441 --> 02:00:45,870
It had hit the world.
Rick Pitino is,

2719
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:49,680
I think he might've been running the 
athletic program in some capacity,

2720
02:00:49,681 --> 02:00:51,870
I don't know if he was the age,
but he was definitely.

2721
02:00:51,871 --> 02:00:52,704
That is one of the top basketball 
coaches in the country and he was 

2722
02:00:55,620 --> 02:01:00,620
getting 98 percent of the cash of this 
deal they had with Adidas.

2723
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:03,383
And what

2724
02:01:03,630 --> 02:01:05,690
did she know about this deal?
That's.

2725
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:10,050
That's so he raked in 98 percent of the 
cash from the University of Louisville.

2726
02:01:10,051 --> 02:01:12,420
Is Current Adidas deal?
How is that possible?

2727
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:14,720
It's a.
it's a.

2728
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:17,600
it's hard to explain how it can even 
happen.

2729
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:19,880
If you watch the movie blue chips from 
the nineties,

2730
02:01:19,881 --> 02:01:20,714
they sort of almost tap into it,
but this was 15 years even before this 

2731
02:01:24,771 --> 02:01:26,970
has happening,
so there's a whole extra world going on.

2732
02:01:26,971 --> 02:01:27,290
Right.

2733
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:28,690
He said,
this is what's funny.

2734
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:29,643
The reporter asked him of some of the 
proceeds will be shared with the 

2735
02:01:31,271 --> 02:01:33,220
university.
He says in quotes,

2736
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:36,040
it's for the athletic department,
junk reply.

2737
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:38,590
How do you say his name?
Derek Jurich replied.

2738
02:01:39,940 --> 02:01:44,600
It's for these student athletes.
It's been earmarked for them high.

2739
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:48,380
In fact,
under the current deal with Adidas,

2740
02:01:48,381 --> 02:01:49,214
which explained,
which expires July first 98 percent of 

2741
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:55,250
the cash provided by adidas goes to one 
person,

2742
02:01:55,640 --> 02:01:58,910
Rick Pitino the now suspended head 
coach.

2743
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:03,830
That's fucking crazy.
Look at the next sentence.

2744
02:02:04,340 --> 02:02:06,490
Oh God.
Two Thousand Fifteen,

2745
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:07,700
2016.
For example,

2746
02:02:07,701 --> 02:02:08,534
one point $5 million went to Pitino 
under his personal services agreement 

2747
02:02:11,781 --> 02:02:12,614
with the Apparel Company is $25,000.
Went to the program according to the 

2748
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:20,540
contract obtained by the courier journal
under the State's public records act

2749
02:02:21,810 --> 02:02:25,570
the year before the department got 10 
grand and we got one point 5 million.

2750
02:02:25,930 --> 02:02:27,910
That's incredible.
Why would they pay him so much?

2751
02:02:28,210 --> 02:02:30,430
Because he didn't work.
He can recruit a,

2752
02:02:30,610 --> 02:02:31,443
it's so he can recruit the kids to this 
school because he's got the name and 

2753
02:02:34,751 --> 02:02:37,900
whether or not he's got some sort of 
ability to sell them also,

2754
02:02:37,901 --> 02:02:38,830
you know,
I don't know that,

2755
02:02:38,831 --> 02:02:41,200
but he can bring them in because he's 
got a,

2756
02:02:41,530 --> 02:02:42,363
uh,
almost a franchise of national 

2757
02:02:44,381 --> 02:02:47,140
championships or at least the ability to
be on national TV.

2758
02:02:47,650 --> 02:02:50,680
And then that level of Spanish 
tournament I'm telling you about.

2759
02:02:50,681 --> 02:02:53,740
Like he'll get your eyes on there,
which gets you with the NBA contract,

2760
02:02:53,741 --> 02:02:56,170
which is the old old dream.
While you can sell that,

2761
02:02:56,171 --> 02:02:57,004
they can sell that dream to them.
Those NBA deals are the best fucking 

2762
02:03:00,101 --> 02:03:04,150
deals in the world.
The guaranteed contracts to play and the

2763
02:03:04,151 --> 02:03:06,580
shoe deals.
Those shoe deals are big.

2764
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:11,260
Do the shoe deals for those guys.
The NBA guys for the top tier guys,

2765
02:03:11,261 --> 02:03:12,094
which is of course a very select few,
but it's nine figures before they ever 

2766
02:03:15,461 --> 02:03:16,294
played ball like they're.
They're signing like hundred million 

2767
02:03:19,390 --> 02:03:20,223
dollar deals.
Jesus for they play professional 

2768
02:03:22,121 --> 02:03:23,590
basketball.
That's crazy.

2769
02:03:23,591 --> 02:03:24,424
Yeah.
There's fucking amazing and outrageous 

2770
02:03:26,711 --> 02:03:27,544
amounts of money.

2771
02:03:29,430 --> 02:03:31,670
We were talking about under armour,
about how one,

2772
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:32,513
what was the player that said nobody 
wants to play in under armour's having 

2773
02:03:34,450 --> 02:03:36,850
there and said that he needs sank the 
stock.

2774
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:38,313
By saying that because universities have
deals with sneaker competence and that 

2775
02:03:41,921 --> 02:03:42,754
no one wanted to play for Maryland 
because they didn't want to play with 

2776
02:03:44,981 --> 02:03:45,814
under armour.
I didn't want to wear under armor and 

2777
02:03:47,441 --> 02:03:52,000
everything just went and they had been 
struggling ever since.

2778
02:03:52,060 --> 02:03:52,990
Really?
Yes.

2779
02:03:52,990 --> 02:03:53,300
Yes.

2780
02:03:53,300 --> 02:03:57,650
It's amazing to me the way under armour 
has been able to compete,

2781
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:01,130
period,
like that is so outrageous that that's a

2782
02:04:01,131 --> 02:04:04,400
former university of Maryland student 
athlete.

2783
02:04:04,401 --> 02:04:05,234
I think he was a student athlete and 
that he was able to start an apparel 

2784
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:12,440
company,
Athletic Company,

2785
02:04:12,530 --> 02:04:16,250
and really actually compete with Adidas 
and Nike.

2786
02:04:16,251 --> 02:04:17,084
I mean that is so nuts.
It would be like you starting a fucking 

2787
02:04:21,471 --> 02:04:24,200
car tomorrow and then you're like,
yeah,

2788
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:27,510
it's you Porsche,
bmw or a joke or what do you like?

2789
02:04:27,750 --> 02:04:29,280
Like it's fucking,
it's.

2790
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:31,430
That's how nuts that is to break into 
that field.

2791
02:04:31,490 --> 02:04:32,241
Really?
Yeah.

2792
02:04:32,241 --> 02:04:33,074
Fuck.
Yet his men that they have that shit so 

2793
02:04:35,091 --> 02:04:37,530
locked down.
They have such deep pockets.

2794
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:41,370
They're the,
the levels of endorsements and like what

2795
02:04:41,371 --> 02:04:45,270
he started doing,
the under armour guy wouldn't even pay.

2796
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:48,120
Like now they have paid endorsed 
athletes,

2797
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:50,910
but at first people were just liking the
gear.

2798
02:04:51,270 --> 02:04:53,610
He was like one of the first ones to 
develop that,

2799
02:04:54,360 --> 02:04:57,030
you know that like tight fit,
breathe.

2800
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:57,864
Right.
I'm like compression gear and like he 

2801
02:05:00,421 --> 02:05:04,180
developed some of it and we'd give it to
a former p,

2802
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:05,730
like people he knew at University of 
Maryland,

2803
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:06,680
we're now like in the,
they're like,

2804
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:08,850
I like to shit and so does my boy,
you know,

2805
02:05:08,980 --> 02:05:10,980
throw us some more of that.
And it was like that.

2806
02:05:11,010 --> 02:05:11,731
It was like,
you know,

2807
02:05:11,731 --> 02:05:16,410
just kind of a very organic way of 
developing,

2808
02:05:16,770 --> 02:05:19,170
of like somebody would be like,
if you bake something and you're like,

2809
02:05:19,171 --> 02:05:19,891
oh,
that tastes good,

2810
02:05:19,891 --> 02:05:21,960
like you make me another one from me and
my friends.

2811
02:05:22,110 --> 02:05:22,943
It was that I was reading something 
really interesting where they were 

2812
02:05:24,811 --> 02:05:25,644
saying that they,
they're fucking up the brand because 

2813
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:28,404
they've put them into discount stores,
that they're trying to raise the sails 

2814
02:05:32,401 --> 02:05:35,250
and by raising the sales they put them 
in a discount stores and by putting them

2815
02:05:35,251 --> 02:05:36,084
in the discount stores,
they're going to change the way people 

2816
02:05:37,741 --> 02:05:38,490
look at the brand.

2817
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,550
It's not going to be worth as much.
That's probably a very realistic man.

2818
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:45,950
That's very interesting.
Weird people think so weird and no.

2819
02:05:46,010 --> 02:05:48,180
If you saw a pair of Nike's at a 
discount store,

2820
02:05:48,181 --> 02:05:51,020
would you like go for north?
That what?

2821
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:53,100
That means?
Zero to me.

2822
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:53,970
Yeah.
No,

2823
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:56,490
and they hadn't been in Nike has a 
outlet stores,

2824
02:05:56,520 --> 02:05:58,270
which is like discount now.
Yes.

2825
02:05:58,380 --> 02:05:59,880
You know,
so that's,

2826
02:06:00,090 --> 02:06:02,370
that's Kinda weird.
But it is true about how.

2827
02:06:02,630 --> 02:06:03,463
I mean the other one is like that big 
baller brand there basically attempting 

2828
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:10,200
to compete in the apparel world.
Lavar Ball,

2829
02:06:10,201 --> 02:06:10,860
right?
Yeah.

2830
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:11,693
President guy that got in that crazy 
thing because his son was arrested in 

2831
02:06:14,190 --> 02:06:16,170
China for shoplifting.
Yes.

2832
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,580
The China.
He was in China.

2833
02:06:17,581 --> 02:06:18,414
Yeah.
He was shoplifting and then trump says 

2834
02:06:20,761 --> 02:06:23,700
he got him out and the dad says he 
didn't get them out.

2835
02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:24,760
Yeah,
it's that.

2836
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:25,560
That's him.
Then.

2837
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:28,470
And then the dad is trump's calling the 
data fool.

2838
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,720
What happened that trump's.
I mean,

2839
02:06:30,721 --> 02:06:34,140
well that guy is very brash of our ball.
Oh yeah,

2840
02:06:34,141 --> 02:06:34,620
yeah.
Yeah.

2841
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:36,780
But I think you know,
that guy knows what he's doing,

2842
02:06:36,781 --> 02:06:37,710
man.
As far as,

2843
02:06:38,010 --> 02:06:39,900
as far as pr,
definitely.

2844
02:06:40,050 --> 02:06:42,870
He knows he's going to say some wild 
shit and he knows people are going to be

2845
02:06:42,871 --> 02:06:43,890
like,
oh my God,

2846
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:44,963
what did he say?
And then he knows that that gets him 

2847
02:06:47,011 --> 02:06:47,844
more press and like it,
it kind of just feeds itself and people 

2848
02:06:50,521 --> 02:06:54,480
act like he believed the fucking crazy 
shit that asshole just said.

2849
02:06:54,481 --> 02:06:54,931
And he was like,
yeah,

2850
02:06:54,931 --> 02:06:57,600
that's what I do and that's why you keep
putting me on the show.

2851
02:06:57,900 --> 02:06:58,733
But he's like trump,
when he was running for prep 100 

2852
02:07:00,031 --> 02:07:00,864
percent,
it's the same school of thought and now 

2853
02:07:02,071 --> 02:07:03,300
though that guy.

2854
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:07,470
So he has a son in Lonzo plays for the 
Lakers,

2855
02:07:07,620 --> 02:07:09,510
who's a fourth round,
first round draft pick,

2856
02:07:09,511 --> 02:07:14,511
like a top tier player from Ucla.
Then his other son was two more sons.

2857
02:07:15,360 --> 02:07:20,130
One of them was on Ucla team this year,
got arrested for shoplifting in China.

2858
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:22,380
If he hadn't been released,
if it wasn't high,

2859
02:07:22,390 --> 02:07:23,223
blissfully highly publicized thing,
he definitely could have gone to jail 

2860
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:28,140
for a while in China.
They don't fuck around,

2861
02:07:28,141 --> 02:07:28,880
you know.
Right.

2862
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:29,790
So,
but anyways,

2863
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:35,030
when he got out and came back,
Lavar pulled him from like from school,

2864
02:07:36,190 --> 02:07:41,190
from Ucla and also pulled his 16 year 
old son at a highschool and flew them to

2865
02:07:43,451 --> 02:07:44,284
Lithuania where they're now playing.
Both of them were playing professional 

2866
02:07:47,291 --> 02:07:52,291
basketball in Lithuania and professional
professional quotes.

2867
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:54,910
Jamie did the air quotes.
It's got to be in big air quotes.

2868
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:56,380
Yeah,
for sure.

2869
02:07:56,410 --> 02:07:57,550
Well,
I mean there's definitely some,

2870
02:07:57,640 --> 02:07:59,230
some good players that come out of 
there,

2871
02:07:59,590 --> 02:08:00,423
but it's like,
I mean it is a circus over there if you 

2872
02:08:02,861 --> 02:08:04,660
see like how it was when they arrived.

2873
02:08:04,990 --> 02:08:08,440
It was like some crazy.
The reception,

2874
02:08:08,441 --> 02:08:10,150
you know.
So what is he trying to do now is trying

2875
02:08:10,151 --> 02:08:12,550
to start some new league.
He's trying to do a couple things.

2876
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:13,413
He started a brand big baller brand and 
they know that's like their ball and 

2877
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:19,503
they came out with these shoes.
They're basically $500 retail sneakers 

2878
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:24,273
and if you're like,
that's expensive because you're not a 

2879
02:08:25,061 --> 02:08:26,220
big baller bitch.
That's why,

2880
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:27,213
you know,
it's like what are they like made by a 

2881
02:08:29,191 --> 02:08:31,680
real organization?
Didas no,

2882
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:32,480
no,
no,

2883
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:32,831
no,
no.

2884
02:08:32,831 --> 02:08:35,140
They're not made by definitely not any,
and by the way,

2885
02:08:35,141 --> 02:08:39,100
the sun that's in the NBA turned down 
real money,

2886
02:08:39,460 --> 02:08:40,293
like real fucking money because he was 
the father demanded that you basically 

2887
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:49,880
pay to develop this brand from the big 
uh,

2888
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,753
apparel and the guy's like,
give us like a billion dollar contract 

2889
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:55,730
and like develop this brand.
What?

2890
02:08:56,080 --> 02:08:57,080
And they were like,
no,

2891
02:08:57,220 --> 02:08:58,780
we're not doing that.
And he's like,

2892
02:08:58,781 --> 02:09:01,810
well then we're not even going to talk 
to you about endorsing my science.

2893
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:03,130
Seriously.
One hundred percent.

2894
02:09:03,280 --> 02:09:06,010
Yes.
Then now he's had like,

2895
02:09:06,070 --> 02:09:06,903
there's so much a conversation about the
brand that he's definitely elevated the 

2896
02:09:13,931 --> 02:09:15,910
awareness of it.
What we don't know,

2897
02:09:15,911 --> 02:09:16,744
what nobody knows is like,
to what level are they actually selling 

2898
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:21,600
this apparel,
you know,

2899
02:09:21,610 --> 02:09:23,350
like are they.
Because they have everything.

2900
02:09:23,351 --> 02:09:24,184
They have shirts and shoes.
They just got it rated an f by the 

2901
02:09:26,650 --> 02:09:30,610
better business bureau because their 
shoes are not the ones they sold.

2902
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:33,940
They sold a bunch of shoes and they're 
the ones that people are getting are not

2903
02:09:33,970 --> 02:09:35,590
what they bought.
So people are pissed.

2904
02:09:35,650 --> 02:09:37,920
There's no way to return refund.
Yeah.

2905
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:39,900
Great Fund or exchange them.
Yeah,

2906
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:41,530
and they're just telling people they're 
literally.

2907
02:09:41,531 --> 02:09:43,590
I think I read that the customer service
people told you,

2908
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:44,483
oh,
you must be a brook baller then if 

2909
02:09:45,730 --> 02:09:47,440
you're not satisfied.

2910
02:09:47,600 --> 02:09:49,960
Yeah.
That's literally what my God.

2911
02:09:50,290 --> 02:09:51,490
But he's also.
I mean he's.

2912
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:52,570
So anyways,
he's,

2913
02:09:52,730 --> 02:09:53,980
he's,
he's the,

2914
02:09:54,160 --> 02:09:56,920
he took these kids to Lithuania.
They're going to play basketball.

2915
02:09:56,921 --> 02:09:58,780
He's like,
he basically says they're going to be on

2916
02:09:58,781 --> 02:10:00,970
the Lakers when my three sons are going 
to be Lakers.

2917
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:04,960
So.
And we have no idea really realistically

2918
02:10:04,961 --> 02:10:09,961
whether the two younger sons even have,
we don't know to be fair whether they're

2919
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:12,670
going to be mba quality players yet,
you know,

2920
02:10:12,940 --> 02:10:15,850
like the clearly one is the one is on 
the Lakers,

2921
02:10:15,851 --> 02:10:18,430
but so we don't know if that's going to 
pan out in any way,

2922
02:10:18,431 --> 02:10:22,120
shape or form.
He also talked about developing a league

2923
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:23,673
for like kids that are coming out of 
high school that don't want to go to 

2924
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:32,071
college and play in a league where they 
get paid like a salary,

2925
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:34,310
you know,
a reasonable salary,

2926
02:10:35,150 --> 02:10:38,870
which is an idea that a lot of people 
think is fascinating.

2927
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:42,680
I don't know logistically whether he 
could pull that off,

2928
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:44,930
you know,
that's kind of a know for sure.

2929
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:45,711
Right.
I mean,

2930
02:10:45,711 --> 02:10:46,544
but.
But the idea is one that people have 

2931
02:10:47,511 --> 02:10:48,344
talked about for years because college 
athletes generate a lot of revenue 

2932
02:10:52,210 --> 02:10:53,350
getting fucked.
Yeah.

2933
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:55,440
Pay Athletes Getting pimped out.
Yeah.

2934
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,860
One hundred percent.
Especially in football and basketball.

2935
02:10:57,890 --> 02:10:58,723
But will.
You were telling me what I was talking 

2936
02:10:59,541 --> 02:11:01,600
to Jamie when you went to Pete about 
the,

2937
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:04,460
how big the game was that you went to 
fucking God.

2938
02:11:04,490 --> 02:11:07,610
And I was saying is what about baseball?
Baseball like down,

2939
02:11:07,620 --> 02:11:07,941
like,
no,

2940
02:11:07,941 --> 02:11:09,440
nobody gives a fuck about college 
baseball.

2941
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:11,780
Basketball is a little bit,
you said March madness.

2942
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,540
Definitely those are the big college 
football.

2943
02:11:14,650 --> 02:11:17,180
Get that big time.
That's the end.

2944
02:11:17,181 --> 02:11:19,340
It's worth billions of dollars.
Many billions.

2945
02:11:19,341 --> 02:11:19,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

2946
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:22,220
Which is crazy.
Those kids aren't getting paid.

2947
02:11:22,221 --> 02:11:24,230
That doesn't make any fucking sense.
Well,

2948
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:25,540
we've got a free scholarship,
Joe.

2949
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:27,770
He could go to school for free and oh 
great.

2950
02:11:27,771 --> 02:11:31,250
Get $25,000 a years.
Where the free education.

2951
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:33,260
Fuck you.
I,

2952
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:34,610
I tend to agree.

2953
02:11:35,070 --> 02:11:35,903
I'd say there's a couple of kids,
a interesting story that came out 

2954
02:11:37,591 --> 02:11:39,990
earlier this year.
He's on one of the teams that did really

2955
02:11:39,991 --> 02:11:41,880
good UFC or ucf,
I'm sorry.

2956
02:11:42,170 --> 02:11:43,003
GCFS kicker was a youtuber right as the 
season started and he got in trouble 

2957
02:11:47,371 --> 02:11:51,570
because he was making profit off of his 
likeness on Youtube.

2958
02:11:51,571 --> 02:11:53,310
So they took away his ability to do 
that.

2959
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:54,233
Oh,
he got kicked off the team and I think 

2960
02:11:54,991 --> 02:11:55,790
he left the team.

2961
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:58,280
Oh my God.
You fucking monsters.

2962
02:11:58,580 --> 02:11:59,680
Like,
I know what,

2963
02:11:59,960 --> 02:12:02,690
you don't own people that.
That's what drives me crazy.

2964
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:03,583
It's like you don't own people.
They're providing a service that makes 

2965
02:12:05,451 --> 02:12:09,890
you an extraordinary amount of money and
yet you are keeping all of it like depth

2966
02:12:09,891 --> 02:12:10,724
pitino thing.
One point 5 million to give him 10 

2967
02:12:13,311 --> 02:12:16,320
grand,
10 grand out of the money.

2968
02:12:17,470 --> 02:12:18,590
Oh,
that's the argument.

2969
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:23,090
I know.
I think that the thing about assholes to

2970
02:12:23,091 --> 02:12:24,410
people who,
um,

2971
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:25,303
who really argue the free education 
thing and like how that should be of 

2972
02:12:29,171 --> 02:12:32,990
value is because they ain't worth a 
shit.

2973
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,820
Like that's why they think that's 
awesome.

2974
02:12:35,050 --> 02:12:35,883
Yeah.
Like your skill level is not impressive 

2975
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:41,180
and you don't generate millions and 
billions of dollars,

2976
02:12:41,181 --> 02:12:45,020
so you go fucking $100,000 worth of free
education there.

2977
02:12:45,021 --> 02:12:45,591
It's like,
yeah,

2978
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:48,200
but like I'm bringing in 10 million to 
the table,

2979
02:12:48,201 --> 02:12:49,490
bro.
That's the thing.

2980
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:50,630
And here's the big thing.

2981
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:54,470
How much damage are they getting in that
four years?

2982
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:59,450
How much damage they're doing to their 
body and football in high level,

2983
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:00,313
division one fbs football.
Lot of those dudes are playing and 

2984
02:13:04,220 --> 02:13:05,860
they're playing basically with,
you know,

2985
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:08,290
the,
the next NFL players.

2986
02:13:08,291 --> 02:13:09,440
So they're,
yeah,

2987
02:13:09,441 --> 02:13:11,570
they're fucking each other up.
They're fucking each other up.

2988
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:12,473
And the odds of their body getting 
damaged to the point where they can 

2989
02:13:14,991 --> 02:13:16,910
never compete professionally are very 
hot.

2990
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:18,020
Oh definitely.
Yeah.

2991
02:13:18,021 --> 02:13:21,920
So if you think of like there was a 
statistic about nba or excuse me,

2992
02:13:21,921 --> 02:13:22,754
nfl players,
like how many of them make it into the 

2993
02:13:25,311 --> 02:13:28,990
fourth year and it's very low for long 
league.

2994
02:13:29,110 --> 02:13:29,921
Very call it.
Yeah.

2995
02:13:29,921 --> 02:13:31,680
This is what they call,
that's the nickname for the NFL.

2996
02:13:32,460 --> 02:13:33,780
Not for long.
Yeah.

2997
02:13:33,781 --> 02:13:36,810
The average NFL career is three point 
some seasons,

2998
02:13:36,811 --> 02:13:37,440
so yeah.
Yeah.

2999
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:38,273
So think of that you're,
you're basically trying to do to outrun 

3000
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:44,910
that through college and then make it 
into the pros.

3001
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:46,290
Yeah.
That's why you really,

3002
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:47,153
from a business perspective,
you really have to support guys coming 

3003
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:52,530
out of college early to the NFL.
Oh,

3004
02:13:52,531 --> 02:13:54,480
100 percent.
I mean there's people who are like,

3005
02:13:55,020 --> 02:13:57,960
some people I've get the fuck outta 
here.

3006
02:13:57,961 --> 02:13:59,370
I'll read a book.
Yeah,

3007
02:13:59,530 --> 02:14:01,350
I'm balling.
I'll go back,

3008
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,410
go back with my free time,
then go back.

3009
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:06,720
You're still only going to be 25 years 
old when your career's over.

3010
02:14:06,721 --> 02:14:09,750
That's fucking nuts.
This millions on the table.

3011
02:14:09,830 --> 02:14:11,580
Millions.
Twenty two.

3012
02:14:11,640 --> 02:14:12,780
Come on.
Hello?

3013
02:14:12,790 --> 02:14:15,870
You ever think about how poorly you 
would handle that?

3014
02:14:15,930 --> 02:14:20,640
I think about it now a lot.
If I had been 22 and so it's almost like

3015
02:14:20,641 --> 02:14:21,930
here's $10,000,000.
I'd be like,

3016
02:14:21,931 --> 02:14:24,780
wow,
I would definitely not have been like,

3017
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,030
yeah dude.
Able to handle that.

3018
02:14:27,031 --> 02:14:28,380
Well,
yeah,

3019
02:14:28,381 --> 02:14:29,214
I think about that hardcore.
I think about like what if I won the 

3020
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:32,160
lottery when I was 20?

3021
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:34,110
Like what?
Go nuts.

3022
02:14:34,470 --> 02:14:35,710
You go nuts.
Yeah.

3023
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:37,710
I got diamonds in my jacket,
man.

3024
02:14:37,740 --> 02:14:38,573
Check it out.
Diamonds on my teeth versus from my 

3025
02:14:40,170 --> 02:14:42,720
buttons are all diamonds on my Dick 
Hole.

3026
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:44,490
Definitely.
Yeah.

3027
02:14:44,491 --> 02:14:46,140
I think um,
we talked,

3028
02:14:46,190 --> 02:14:47,023
we were talking about earlier about a 
guy being rich and having enriched 

3029
02:14:49,950 --> 02:14:54,360
children struggles.
Fucking very important for you.

3030
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,580
Yeah.
It's very good for you.

3031
02:14:57,180 --> 02:14:59,640
It's very important for you.
It builds character.

3032
02:14:59,641 --> 02:15:00,840
It builds,
resolve,

3033
02:15:00,980 --> 02:15:02,190
respect now.
Yeah.

3034
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,320
Yeah.
Respect money.

3035
02:15:04,530 --> 02:15:08,580
That like how many professional athletes
who wink millions of dollars work out as

3036
02:15:08,581 --> 02:15:10,470
hard as my friend Cameron Hanes,
right?

3037
02:15:10,830 --> 02:15:13,290
Think of that fucking guy has a regular 
job.

3038
02:15:13,291 --> 02:15:16,560
Dude works with department of Water and 
power and Oregon.

3039
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:17,760
Does he really?
Yep.

3040
02:15:18,660 --> 02:15:22,980
Nine to five.
Regular job during his lunch hour.

3041
02:15:23,010 --> 02:15:24,360
He doesn't work.
Nine to five.

3042
02:15:24,570 --> 02:15:25,403
He works like seven to four and one of 
the reasons why he's got an extra hour 

3043
02:15:32,131 --> 02:15:34,800
in there is because he runs during his 
lunch break,

3044
02:15:34,801 --> 02:15:38,400
so he takes like two hour lunches and 
runs for two fucking hours,

3045
02:15:38,880 --> 02:15:42,630
runs the hills and then comes back and 
finishes out the rest of the eight hours

3046
02:15:42,631 --> 02:15:43,140
of the day.

3047
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:45,660
What that did,
it feels good all day though to savage.

3048
02:15:45,930 --> 02:15:47,190
Yeah.
It doesn't feel good.

3049
02:15:47,191 --> 02:15:50,550
He doesn't want to feel good just one 
more time,

3050
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:52,073
but he's happy.
He's happy and pain gets not grimacing 

3051
02:15:56,761 --> 02:15:57,600
in pain.
He's like,

3052
02:15:57,660 --> 02:15:59,430
this shit hurts.
There's like it.

3053
02:15:59,580 --> 02:16:02,880
There's a mindset of those people though
that can do those ultra marathons.

3054
02:16:02,881 --> 02:16:07,320
That's a different world inside your 
dome and you're some darkness in there.

3055
02:16:07,321 --> 02:16:08,154
You're trying to.
What was that woman that smashed all of 

3056
02:16:10,141 --> 02:16:11,610
the important until Walter?
Yeah,

3057
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:14,400
she passed.
Did you listen to the podcast?

3058
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:15,750
She's not.
She's amazing.

3059
02:16:15,751 --> 02:16:18,090
She's Nachos and drinks.
Beer eats candy.

3060
02:16:18,150 --> 02:16:20,880
She's eating candy when she was hanging 
out with what's going on in her brain,

3061
02:16:20,881 --> 02:16:22,050
man,
that's what I want to see.

3062
02:16:22,051 --> 02:16:24,750
I want to see a ct scan.
She's a straight up savage.

3063
02:16:25,080 --> 02:16:25,913
I'll tell you what she does.
She telling us about how she had some 

3064
02:16:28,471 --> 02:16:30,490
sort of Retina Adima

3065
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:34,180
where she was almost blind because,
uh,

3066
02:16:34,210 --> 02:16:36,610
her contacts fucked up or something like
that.

3067
02:16:36,611 --> 02:16:37,444
And her,
her,

3068
02:16:37,540 --> 02:16:40,480
her eyeballs were bleeding and she 
couldn't see and she fell,

3069
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:44,740
cracked her head open like,
like blood pouring down her head still.

3070
02:16:44,741 --> 02:16:45,574
One couldn't see,
couldn't see where her feet were while 

3071
02:16:48,701 --> 02:16:49,810
she was running.
Her brain.

3072
02:16:49,811 --> 02:16:52,690
Can Not be the same.
She's just tough.

3073
02:16:53,250 --> 02:16:54,083
There's,
there's mental toughness that some 

3074
02:16:55,691 --> 02:17:00,691
people have that is almost an 
explainable like you don't like.

3075
02:17:00,941 --> 02:17:04,360
What makes them that tough?
I don't understand it.

3076
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:07,870
The ability to block out all the 
negative voices.

3077
02:17:07,871 --> 02:17:09,310
The stock.
I mean,

3078
02:17:09,550 --> 02:17:10,690
well,
think about personalities,

3079
02:17:10,691 --> 02:17:12,110
right?
Like a personality like burt.

3080
02:17:12,430 --> 02:17:14,710
It can be the life of the party.
That's not me.

3081
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:17,200
I'm not that guy.
Never been that guy.

3082
02:17:17,740 --> 02:17:19,270
I mean I can.
I can.

3083
02:17:20,240 --> 02:17:22,420
If we're all hanging around together,
we're all drinking.

3084
02:17:22,421 --> 02:17:23,254
I can make everybody laugh and be silly 
and we could all have a good time 

3085
02:17:25,121 --> 02:17:25,954
together,
but I don't gravitate towards that 

3086
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:29,470
thinking,
that kind of behavior.

3087
02:17:29,590 --> 02:17:33,100
Whereas burt can walk into a liquor 
store and having everybody sing along to

3088
02:17:33,101 --> 02:17:33,934
I would die for you.
He's got his phone out and people are 

3089
02:17:36,011 --> 02:17:39,700
dancing and yeah,
it's genuine personality type too.

3090
02:17:39,730 --> 02:17:41,680
He is.
That's his personality type.

3091
02:17:41,710 --> 02:17:42,543
Some people have that personality type 
where they'll get up at 4:30 in the 

3092
02:17:45,941 --> 02:17:50,941
morning and you know it's dark outside 
and they relish the fact that they don't

3093
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:54,640
want to put the running shoes on and 
they don't want to hit that mountain and

3094
02:17:54,641 --> 02:17:55,474
run.
They relish the fact that there there's 

3095
02:17:57,030 --> 02:17:58,870
going to struggle.
They like it.

3096
02:17:58,930 --> 02:18:00,790
They like it.
They like the pain,

3097
02:18:00,791 --> 02:18:04,570
they liked the stinging of the.
The lungs is there.

3098
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:07,540
Your lungs struggle to fill with air 
would like it.

3099
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:08,590
Yeah.
True.

3100
02:18:09,010 --> 02:18:09,843
Yeah.
They like also the fact that other 

3101
02:18:10,931 --> 02:18:11,764
people can't do what they can do.
That like the fact that there's people 

3102
02:18:13,811 --> 02:18:14,644
that are in bed that are comfortably 
asleep while they're out there doing it 

3103
02:18:17,921 --> 02:18:18,970
and it gives them an edge.

3104
02:18:19,210 --> 02:18:20,710
Sure.
Yeah.

3105
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:21,340
Well,
what,

3106
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:22,173
what makes a person's personality to be 
this outgoing extrovert like Bert 

3107
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:27,633
Kreischer?
What makes that stoic individual that 

3108
02:18:29,171 --> 02:18:31,360
can sit and go over,
you know,

3109
02:18:31,600 --> 02:18:35,890
like an accountant who can just sit and 
go over things for hours and hours.

3110
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:36,743
A coder,
somebody could sit in front of a 

3111
02:18:37,811 --> 02:18:38,644
computer and go over a 10,
12 hours a day is worth a certain 

3112
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:42,730
mindset.
It's a different kind of human,

3113
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:43,780
right?
Yeah.

3114
02:18:43,781 --> 02:18:48,781
Because both of those personalities,
I could never entertain just so far from

3115
02:18:50,561 --> 02:18:52,720
what I am.
I'm fascinated by personalities.

3116
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:54,770
Yeah.
I just find it.

3117
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:56,253
There's so many variables like,
as to what makes a person who they are 

3118
02:19:00,101 --> 02:19:02,880
and,
and how it changes over time and who,

3119
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,140
who you are.
The more you consider yourself.

3120
02:19:05,560 --> 02:19:07,530
Like I did a podcast yesterday,
uh,

3121
02:19:07,531 --> 02:19:08,364
about meditation.
It was all about meditation with Dan 

3122
02:19:10,450 --> 02:19:14,200
Harris from Good Morning America who's a
big proponent of meditation and um,

3123
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:18,280
This Guy,
Jeff Warren who wrote this book,

3124
02:19:18,310 --> 02:19:19,330
a head trip,
very,

3125
02:19:19,331 --> 02:19:21,940
very interesting guy who was his 
meditation teacher.

3126
02:19:22,430 --> 02:19:23,263
We're just talking about thought 
processes and the mind and managing on 

3127
02:19:27,501 --> 02:19:28,334
and managing the way you do things.
Don't do things and how much of these 

3128
02:19:30,861 --> 02:19:31,694
little weird kinks and pitfalls can just
trip you up and fuck you up in your 

3129
02:19:34,911 --> 02:19:35,744
life.
Like imagine Louis ck without this 

3130
02:19:38,481 --> 02:19:39,314
desire to beat off in front of women.
Like let's say he did that 10 times in 

3131
02:19:42,021 --> 02:19:42,854
his whole life.
Imagine if you could get to them before 

3132
02:19:45,111 --> 02:19:46,790
those 10 times and go,
hey man,

3133
02:19:47,300 --> 02:19:48,950
look,
you're a real nice guy.

3134
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:52,790
You've always been friendly to people.
You give good advice as a comedian.

3135
02:19:52,791 --> 02:19:53,624
Just can't beat off in front of people 
because it's going to cost you like 

3136
02:19:57,351 --> 02:20:01,220
$50,000,000 one day what you think so 
yeah.

3137
02:20:01,390 --> 02:20:02,223
Yeah.
One day is going to cost you 

3138
02:20:02,541 --> 02:20:04,730
$50,000,000.
We just beat off in front of people.

3139
02:20:04,731 --> 02:20:07,820
No one's going to work with you,
so just don't do that.

3140
02:20:07,850 --> 02:20:10,010
Don't do that.
Or here's what you could do.

3141
02:20:11,360 --> 02:20:13,760
Pay a hooker and say,
I want to beat off in front of you.

3142
02:20:14,270 --> 02:20:15,103
And she'll go,
okay,

3143
02:20:15,590 --> 02:20:19,100
and then you give her a thousand bucks 
or whatever it costs and you beat off in

3144
02:20:19,101 --> 02:20:20,930
front of her.
If you could do that.

3145
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:22,190
And he'd be like,
hmm.

3146
02:20:22,190 --> 02:20:23,023
That's not to say,
but like what would make a person what 

3147
02:20:29,001 --> 02:20:31,430
makes a person tick?
Really?

3148
02:20:31,450 --> 02:20:32,080
Yeah.
What,

3149
02:20:32,080 --> 02:20:34,340
what?
What is it inside your head?

3150
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:38,240
Like it's all your experiences really 
that become your personality.

3151
02:20:38,241 --> 02:20:41,630
I think it that there's your 
experiences,

3152
02:20:41,631 --> 02:20:44,210
there's managing your particular 
biology,

3153
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:46,100
you know,
there's so many,

3154
02:20:46,280 --> 02:20:47,650
so many different things.
Yeah.

3155
02:20:47,660 --> 02:20:48,493
Because like you,
you're at the age now to where you can 

3156
02:20:50,091 --> 02:20:50,924
see like with your children.
Do you ever see how they're a certain 

3157
02:20:55,071 --> 02:20:56,410
age now,
but you go like,

3158
02:20:56,450 --> 02:20:59,120
I saw that trait in you when you were 
one.

3159
02:20:59,210 --> 02:21:00,360
Oh yeah,
yeah,

3160
02:21:00,570 --> 02:21:02,840
yeah.
You see like the stuff that's natural in

3161
02:21:02,841 --> 02:21:03,674
someone there,
the natural personality trait and then 

3162
02:21:06,170 --> 02:21:10,160
you sprinkle life on top of that starts 
to develop who the person becomes.

3163
02:21:10,310 --> 02:21:13,450
Well your son son's probably just now 
starting to talk you.

3164
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:14,533
You will start to have a little 
conversation with them and then you'll 

3165
02:21:16,071 --> 02:21:19,490
start to see you in them and that's 
where it gets really weird.

3166
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:22,430
You know?
You've inherited all my craziness.

3167
02:21:22,460 --> 02:21:24,860
You see that in your nine year old in 
particular.

3168
02:21:24,980 --> 02:21:26,630
Really.
She's got a lot of my crazy enter.

3169
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:28,170
Yeah.
You,

3170
02:21:28,171 --> 02:21:29,630
you,
you totally see yourself.

3171
02:21:30,230 --> 02:21:34,040
She gets obsessed with things.
I got assessed where she just,

3172
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,903
she'll just do them like all day long,
like we went on a vacation and we were 

3173
02:21:38,331 --> 02:21:43,220
walking back from the resort.
She did cartwheels all the way back from

3174
02:21:43,221 --> 02:21:45,290
the resort to the room.

3175
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:50,450
It was a half mile to find cartwheels 
over and over and over again.

3176
02:21:50,870 --> 02:21:53,540
She just gets nuts about stuff.
Is it the kind of thing we were like,

3177
02:21:53,541 --> 02:21:54,860
hey,
we should probably stop doing that,

3178
02:21:54,950 --> 02:21:56,480
or no,
let her do it.

3179
02:21:57,050 --> 02:21:57,950
I don't.
I don't.

3180
02:21:58,130 --> 02:21:58,963
I think as long as your kids aren't 
hurting themselves and hurting other 

3181
02:22:01,551 --> 02:22:03,740
people,
the more you say,

3182
02:22:03,741 --> 02:22:04,910
Hey,
don't do that,

3183
02:22:04,911 --> 02:22:06,140
the more they're going to want to do 
that.

3184
02:22:06,460 --> 02:22:07,293
It's just natural.
What I try to do is encourage healthy 

3185
02:22:10,881 --> 02:22:12,290
things.
That's it.

3186
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:15,860
I try to like when it comes to like 
candy and sugar and stuff like that,

3187
02:22:15,861 --> 02:22:17,740
I try to tell them,
taste great,

3188
02:22:17,770 --> 02:22:18,603
taste amazing,
but you're really only supposed to have 

3189
02:22:21,651 --> 02:22:24,890
a little bit of it for your.
Just it's bad for your body,

3190
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:25,861
you know?
I don't,

3191
02:22:25,861 --> 02:22:25,980
I

3192
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,540
don't just give them the,
hey,

3193
02:22:27,541 --> 02:22:28,890
you can eat candy.
Hey,

3194
02:22:28,891 --> 02:22:29,760
you can't do that.
I'm like,

3195
02:22:30,030 --> 02:22:31,210
little bit's good.
It's a little bit.

3196
02:22:31,211 --> 02:22:32,640
It's fine.
Let's have a little bit.

3197
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:36,060
Let's enjoy it,
but let's understand what it is like,

3198
02:22:36,061 --> 02:22:39,450
let's be aware of what it is,
but don't be afraid of it.

3199
02:22:39,600 --> 02:22:41,840
Don't run from it.
Don't you know?

3200
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:42,713
Yeah.
Nobody died because they had an ice 

3201
02:22:43,891 --> 02:22:45,160
cream once a week.
Sure.

3202
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:46,200
You know,
it's not going to hurt.

3203
02:22:46,201 --> 02:22:47,430
You just don't have it every fucking 
night.

3204
02:22:47,431 --> 02:22:48,480
Yeah.
I just don't get crazy.

3205
02:22:48,481 --> 02:22:50,730
Don't let it become a part of everything
who you are.

3206
02:22:51,060 --> 02:22:54,720
And one of the things that I do the most
though is encouraged them.

3207
02:22:54,721 --> 02:22:57,270
Like what are they,
what do they enjoy doing?

3208
02:22:57,271 --> 02:22:59,370
Like what do you enjoy doing?
You know,

3209
02:22:59,371 --> 02:23:02,670
like my youngest one loves art.
He loves to draw,

3210
02:23:02,730 --> 02:23:04,920
loves it because it's constantly drawing
this awesome.

3211
02:23:04,920 --> 02:23:06,240
Like let's draw,
let's see,

3212
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:07,790
let's look,
let's do smart.

3213
02:23:08,120 --> 02:23:08,953
It's fun.
It's like there's something like find 

3214
02:23:10,771 --> 02:23:15,530
out whatever it is where you can find 
this avenue for expression and,

3215
02:23:15,540 --> 02:23:16,373
and I want to encourage that as much as 
I can because I feel like if there's 

3216
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:24,600
anything in this life that'll guarantee 
you some satisfaction or some feeling of

3217
02:23:24,660 --> 02:23:26,730
accomplishment or some,
some,

3218
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:30,480
uh,
some way to fuel your passions,

3219
02:23:30,481 --> 02:23:33,600
it's find something that really hits 
your switches.

3220
02:23:34,350 --> 02:23:36,720
Find that thing.
Like you found it,

3221
02:23:36,750 --> 02:23:37,581
right.
You found it,

3222
02:23:37,581 --> 02:23:38,460
but stand up.
Yeah,

3223
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:39,294
totally.
I mean,

3224
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:42,000
but you imagine doing something else 
other than stand up?

3225
02:23:42,001 --> 02:23:42,990
No,
of course not.

3226
02:23:42,991 --> 02:23:44,070
I mean,
at this point,

3227
02:23:44,220 --> 02:23:45,053
I don't know.
I tell people that all the time 

3228
02:23:45,991 --> 02:23:46,824
actually.
It's like that's the thing you become 

3229
02:23:48,421 --> 02:23:50,280
aware of.
I think when you get older you're like,

3230
02:23:50,550 --> 02:23:55,550
I'm so lucky that I do the thing I 
really liked doing the most.

3231
02:23:56,510 --> 02:23:57,343
That's really the thing.
And then you meet people like at the 

3232
02:24:00,390 --> 02:24:02,490
time,
but like I talked to people who,

3233
02:24:02,790 --> 02:24:03,623
you know,
I'm just happy with what they're just 

3234
02:24:04,721 --> 02:24:05,554
like,
I'm not happy with my life and this and 

3235
02:24:06,241 --> 02:24:06,690
that.
I'm like,

3236
02:24:06,690 --> 02:24:08,690
what is it you really want to do?
And they got,

3237
02:24:08,691 --> 02:24:10,830
I don't know,
like real question,

3238
02:24:10,890 --> 02:24:14,430
real question.
If somebody wanted a trade lives,

3239
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:17,910
Jeff Bezos wanted to trade lives,
you get to be Jeff Bezos,

3240
02:24:17,911 --> 02:24:19,260
you get 100,
$5,000,000,000,

3241
02:24:19,530 --> 02:24:21,420
but you can't do standup anymore.
No,

3242
02:24:21,421 --> 02:24:22,650
because I love it.
I love it.

3243
02:24:22,680 --> 02:24:25,140
Yeah.
That's so hard for people to imagine.

3244
02:24:25,141 --> 02:24:26,430
Yeah.
Well no,

3245
02:24:26,431 --> 02:24:27,264
because like I mean that,
that I know that sounds like a comical 

3246
02:24:29,521 --> 02:24:32,670
amount of money and that like who the 
fuck would turn that down?

3247
02:24:32,671 --> 02:24:33,504
But it's like I don't really feel like 
I'm turning something down because I 

3248
02:24:36,270 --> 02:24:37,103
have,
I get so much pleasure and joy out of 

3249
02:24:40,051 --> 02:24:40,884
doing what I do.

3250
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:42,023
So he made that deal and you came back 
to the comedy store and you're watching 

3251
02:24:45,091 --> 02:24:47,730
somebody just kill and you'd be like,
fuck,

3252
02:24:47,731 --> 02:24:49,260
I want to go up.
And they're like,

3253
02:24:49,261 --> 02:24:49,741
Nah,
man,

3254
02:24:49,741 --> 02:24:54,210
you got to take your spaceship home now.
And you're sitting around writing things

3255
02:24:54,211 --> 02:24:56,940
down when you think they're funny and 
you never just getting it to people.

3256
02:24:56,970 --> 02:25:00,860
You take a see if you can make it work.
Do you remember Tom Agnina [inaudible]?

3257
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,590
He's a really funny comedian.
And uh,

3258
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:04,433
apparently he lives in Thailand now and 
just fucking retired on is a writer's 

3259
02:25:09,991 --> 02:25:12,130
guild money really?
And uh,

3260
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:15,870
his mortgage is like 500 bucks a month 
and a,

3261
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:18,480
Neil Brennan went to see him last week 
in Thailand.

3262
02:25:18,690 --> 02:25:19,590
Really?
Yeah.

3263
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,000
And he was a comic?
Yup.

3264
02:25:21,030 --> 02:25:23,290
He's a funny comic.
I knew him from Boston.

3265
02:25:23,350 --> 02:25:24,680
Really good guy.
There's Tom,

3266
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:26,440
magna.
Really good guy.

3267
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:28,330
He's retired.
He lives in Thailand.

3268
02:25:28,620 --> 02:25:30,310
Good for him.
Just on the beach,

3269
02:25:30,370 --> 02:25:32,560
just kicking back.
And apparently he writes still.

3270
02:25:32,650 --> 02:25:33,483
He'll still like write,
write stuff for people but doesn't give 

3271
02:25:36,101 --> 02:25:37,900
a fuck anymore.
Good for him in.

3272
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:40,270
Yeah,
I mean I hear about things like that and

3273
02:25:40,271 --> 02:25:41,470
I go,
wow.

3274
02:25:41,530 --> 02:25:43,840
He did it.
He figured out a way to do it.

3275
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:45,400
You figured out a way to get off the 
bus?

3276
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:47,470
Yeah,
I don't think I'm getting off.

3277
02:25:47,950 --> 02:25:50,920
I feel like I'm going to George Carlin,
this motherfucker keep driving it.

3278
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:51,843
Yeah.
I feel like one day I'm gonna die in a 

3279
02:25:52,721 --> 02:25:54,850
hotel room somewhere.
Eighty years old.

3280
02:25:55,180 --> 02:25:56,013
I don't know.
I mean sometimes I think about like how 

3281
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:58,653
like God damn I'm going to.
How much longer am I going to do this 

3282
02:26:00,251 --> 02:26:05,170
for is it feels like there's too much 
time still ahead of me.

3283
02:26:05,810 --> 02:26:08,150
You know what I mean though,
but I mean like I go like,

3284
02:26:08,470 --> 02:26:09,303
wait,
I'm gonna do this for 25 more years or 

3285
02:26:10,751 --> 02:26:11,020
something.

3286
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:11,853
That's fucking nuts.
The only thing that excites me as much 

3287
02:26:14,660 --> 02:26:17,500
as outdoor stuff.
So you really love that shit.

3288
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:21,390
Kinda jealous of all your hobbies,
but not,

3289
02:26:21,391 --> 02:26:21,880
not.
I mean,

3290
02:26:21,880 --> 02:26:22,713
just that you.
I'm jealous of the fact that you're 

3291
02:26:24,731 --> 02:26:29,380
passionate about like hunting,
shooting pool,

3292
02:26:29,410 --> 02:26:31,120
Jujitsu,
you know,

3293
02:26:31,121 --> 02:26:32,280
archery.
I'm like,

3294
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:33,123
God damn,
I wish I had that much passion for at 

3295
02:26:38,411 --> 02:26:39,940
least one other thing.
You know?

3296
02:26:40,240 --> 02:26:41,073
I just think I'm crazy.
I think I find these things and then I 

3297
02:26:43,361 --> 02:26:44,420
get obsessed with them.
Yeah.

3298
02:26:44,860 --> 02:26:45,693
You know,
I'm lucky that there's like I have to 

3299
02:26:47,081 --> 02:26:49,450
manage those things.
Like got to be careful.

3300
02:26:49,451 --> 02:26:50,284
Like I'm,
I'm lucky I don't know how to fix cars 

3301
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:54,213
if I knew how to fix Kadlec I ha.
I entertain this idea for awhile of 

3302
02:26:56,561 --> 02:26:57,394
building a car from scratch,
really of getting a frame and then 

3303
02:26:59,741 --> 02:27:01,060
starting to put suspension on it.

3304
02:27:01,060 --> 02:27:02,050
And I said,
no,

3305
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:04,390
you've got to stop.
Like you can't do this,

3306
02:27:04,391 --> 02:27:06,220
this will take too much time.
You can't do this.

3307
02:27:06,221 --> 02:27:07,660
I can't.
And I would like it.

3308
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:10,210
I would like it.
I'd start wiring things.

3309
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:11,193
Surprise you.
Don't move or at least get a place in 

3310
02:27:12,371 --> 02:27:13,750
the woods.
I think that's something.

3311
02:27:13,751 --> 02:27:15,180
We're got to get to that too.
Yeah,

3312
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:16,780
I'm scared of that too.
I,

3313
02:27:16,900 --> 02:27:17,510
I,
you know,

3314
02:27:17,510 --> 02:27:21,010
when we lived in boulder,
I liked it a lot.

3315
02:27:21,520 --> 02:27:23,740
I liked it a lot.
I went to that house.

3316
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:25,150
Yeah,
it's beautiful.

3317
02:27:25,210 --> 02:27:26,920
Yeah.
So peaceful up there,

3318
02:27:26,921 --> 02:27:27,754
right?
Amazing.

3319
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:30,310
Just woods and mountain lions eat and 
your dog and shit.

3320
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:34,840
I guess it's weird,
but I don't know man.

3321
02:27:34,990 --> 02:27:37,570
I just have to for,
for me,

3322
02:27:37,571 --> 02:27:38,404
it's always like make sure,
like there's almost like there's two 

3323
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,760
me's,
there's the manager me,

3324
02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:43,211
it's like,
hey,

3325
02:27:43,211 --> 02:27:43,660
hey,
hey,

3326
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:44,140
hold on.

3327
02:27:44,140 --> 02:27:46,570
Before we,
before we embark on this journey,

3328
02:27:46,600 --> 02:27:48,040
let's take a look at where this could go
wrong.

3329
02:27:48,310 --> 02:27:51,190
Let's take a look at where this can go 
before I release the hounds.

3330
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:52,930
And then there's the other part that's 
like,

3331
02:27:52,990 --> 02:27:54,790
just wants to just go,
go for it.

3332
02:27:54,850 --> 02:27:55,940
Go do things.
You know.

3333
02:27:55,960 --> 02:27:57,070
I want a hobby though,
Dude.

3334
02:27:57,580 --> 02:27:58,840
You what kind?
I don't know.

3335
02:27:58,870 --> 02:28:01,230
When I go hunting with me.
Um.

3336
02:28:01,530 --> 02:28:02,350
Oh,
hunting.

3337
02:28:02,350 --> 02:28:04,630
I would go to a range first to see how 
much I dig.

3338
02:28:04,810 --> 02:28:08,500
I haven't shot.
I've shot an arrow bow and arrow,

3339
02:28:08,590 --> 02:28:11,020
but it's been like 25 years.
I've got a range here.

3340
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:12,520
Or You have a range here?
Yeah,

3341
02:28:12,530 --> 02:28:14,290
that's an indoor archery range in this 
place.

3342
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,390
Okay.
I'll.

3343
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:20,800
This weekend I'm getting to a thing 
called a techno hunt installed.

3344
02:28:21,470 --> 02:28:22,130
Techno hunt

3345
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:24,500
is a.
have you ever seen that video game where

3346
02:28:24,501 --> 02:28:28,910
you hit a golf ball in the virtual golf 
ball screen?

3347
02:28:28,970 --> 02:28:30,890
Yeah,
they make that with archery.

3348
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:33,020
You're doing that with bow hunting here?
Yep.

3349
02:28:33,560 --> 02:28:37,790
So there's the animals walk across the 
screen and you shoot it,

3350
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:38,624
the animals with a regular compound bow.
And instead of having sharp pointed 

3351
02:28:41,541 --> 02:28:42,950
tips,
this is,

3352
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:47,210
this is the game right here.
You have a tip that has a flat head,

3353
02:28:47,270 --> 02:28:48,103
like the head of a nail.
And so these animals walk across the 

3354
02:28:50,691 --> 02:28:55,370
screen and you literally shoot at the 
target and like,

3355
02:28:55,371 --> 02:28:58,200
watch it'll show you like it's going to 
be like,

3356
02:28:58,790 --> 02:28:59,320
yeah,
yeah,

3357
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:00,920
I have what's coming this weekend,
Bro.

3358
02:29:02,240 --> 02:29:02,961
See,
watch it.

3359
02:29:02,961 --> 02:29:06,560
It hits where shoots it,
where you would want to get right there,

3360
02:29:06,561 --> 02:29:08,000
right behind the arm.
Bam.

3361
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:10,770
Perfect shot.
So that's going to be like kill.

3362
02:29:10,820 --> 02:29:12,650
So it shows where the,
the,

3363
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:15,350
the thing hit and it shows your score 
and your vitals,

3364
02:29:15,440 --> 02:29:16,430
stuff like that.
Very cool.

3365
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:20,720
You're going to be really into this.
It's crazy.

3366
02:29:20,721 --> 02:29:23,990
There are a burt and I went to top golf.
You know what that is?

3367
02:29:24,050 --> 02:29:24,920
Oh,
that's in Vegas,

3368
02:29:24,921 --> 02:29:26,900
right on top of that.
Exactly.

3369
02:29:26,901 --> 02:29:28,550
They have one in Vegas and they have 
like,

3370
02:29:28,590 --> 02:29:30,110
I dunno,
like 25 locations.

3371
02:29:30,130 --> 02:29:31,120
Oh,
they're all over the place.

3372
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:34,790
We stayed.
We stayed there for like hours hours.

3373
02:29:34,970 --> 02:29:35,803
Like we thought we were going to play 
around but it just became addictive and 

3374
02:29:38,661 --> 02:29:40,280
fun.
We just kept kept doing it.

3375
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:43,220
It's not just driving.
Do you have like a bay?

3376
02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:46,280
Right.
And then like your own the tea and,

3377
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:48,080
and um,
you know,

3378
02:29:48,081 --> 02:29:48,914
the three of you put your names in the 
system and you get a real golf ball and 

3379
02:29:52,670 --> 02:29:53,331
they,
they,

3380
02:29:53,331 --> 02:29:53,840
they,
uh,

3381
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:56,360
track the balls.
So like when you hit it,

3382
02:29:56,450 --> 02:29:58,760
there's targets that you can go for 
points.

3383
02:29:58,860 --> 02:30:03,230
Oh you hit that flat nose like already 
hit the flag and it like,

3384
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:07,190
so you get like eight points and then it
will be like your next balls were double

3385
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:10,340
and if he hit the blue flag it's going 
to be like 16 points.

3386
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:11,353
So like,
and then there's different games within 

3387
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,950
the system.
You can go just for like chip shots.

3388
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:18,650
You can go for distance anyways,
we just,

3389
02:30:18,740 --> 02:30:19,410
man,
I thought we were,

3390
02:30:19,410 --> 02:30:20,960
we thought we were going to play like an
hour.

3391
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:24,010
I think we say four hours.
That's crazy.

3392
02:30:24,040 --> 02:30:25,210
And,
and we were all like,

3393
02:30:25,211 --> 02:30:28,040
we got to find another top golf.
Like we were really,

3394
02:30:28,041 --> 02:30:28,940
really into it.
Man.

3395
02:30:28,941 --> 02:30:32,720
You guys don't even play golf now.
I mean I know those two used to play,

3396
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:36,050
like already said he played regularly a 
long time ago.

3397
02:30:36,110 --> 02:30:39,050
Same with Bert.
They both had much better shots than me,

3398
02:30:39,080 --> 02:30:39,913
but I was equally obsessed with it,
like I didn't care that I was even 

3399
02:30:41,961 --> 02:30:44,930
shitting the bed.
I was having so much fun doing it.

3400
02:30:46,970 --> 02:30:47,803
So many different things you could do.
That's why when people tell me that 

3401
02:30:49,371 --> 02:30:50,590
they're bored,
I mean,

3402
02:30:50,600 --> 02:30:52,040
unless you're broke and there's nothing 
you can do,

3403
02:30:52,041 --> 02:30:54,890
but even then there's so many physical 
activities that you do that are free.

3404
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:55,833
No.
Yeah,

3405
02:30:55,850 --> 02:30:57,490
I understand.
I'm not bored.

3406
02:30:57,491 --> 02:31:00,280
I didn't mean to.
I just like um,

3407
02:31:00,340 --> 02:31:01,173
you know,
throwing myself into an activity like 

3408
02:31:02,771 --> 02:31:04,330
that.
So you need a hobby?

3409
02:31:04,510 --> 02:31:06,130
I think so why don't you get into 
Jujitsu?

3410
02:31:06,280 --> 02:31:07,330
Nah,
no,

3411
02:31:07,630 --> 02:31:09,520
I don't like that guy.
I just need a gun.

3412
02:31:09,550 --> 02:31:11,500
I never liked.
I never liked.

3413
02:31:12,310 --> 02:31:13,990
I never liked wrestling.
I wrestled,

3414
02:31:14,270 --> 02:31:15,103
I hated it.
I just don't like having like guys on 

3415
02:31:17,891 --> 02:31:18,724
top of you.
Yeah.

3416
02:31:18,750 --> 02:31:19,920
And I don't like,
you know,

3417
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:22,470
my neck being jacked or any of that 
shit.

3418
02:31:22,640 --> 02:31:23,880
Like I didn't,
I never liked,

3419
02:31:24,420 --> 02:31:26,040
you know,
how about more time.

3420
02:31:26,870 --> 02:31:28,590
I liked throwing punches.
That's cool.

3421
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:29,780
I like that.
Yeah.

3422
02:31:29,820 --> 02:31:30,653
Just taking them more Thai class,
learning how to kick the bag or and how 

3423
02:31:32,691 --> 02:31:33,524
to hit the pads.
Maybe learning how to use your defense 

3424
02:31:36,030 --> 02:31:37,400
move.
Push away.

3425
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:39,670
I like that.
Maybe photography.

3426
02:31:39,671 --> 02:31:43,590
I'm like old ladies tries to pinch her 
ass after show you sweep the leg,

3427
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:44,610
sweep the leg,
knock her out.

3428
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:48,090
Take her down.
Arash.

3429
02:31:48,390 --> 02:31:52,040
Get some good press next day.
Q magic.

3430
02:31:52,220 --> 02:31:53,053
Did you see that thing with uh,
Josh Homme from the Queens of the Stone 

3431
02:31:57,181 --> 02:31:59,760
Age kitten?
Some photographer?

3432
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:01,770
Yes.
The fuck was going on?

3433
02:32:01,771 --> 02:32:02,604
Yeah.
Apparently the later stories like with 

3434
02:32:04,321 --> 02:32:06,360
her flash was really fucking bothering 
everybody.

3435
02:32:06,740 --> 02:32:07,573
Oh,
it wasn't like she wasn't supposed to 

3436
02:32:09,061 --> 02:32:13,470
have a flash going,
but that was not okay.

3437
02:32:13,470 --> 02:32:15,120
The way that shit went down,
man.

3438
02:32:15,121 --> 02:32:16,170
Yeah.
You're supposed to go,

3439
02:32:16,171 --> 02:32:17,900
hey,
lady turned the fucking off.

3440
02:32:18,200 --> 02:32:19,033
And he wasn't part of his thing.
Like I was trying to kick the camera 

3441
02:32:21,131 --> 02:32:23,190
where be like,
kicked her in the head or cities kicking

3442
02:32:23,191 --> 02:32:24,780
equipment around and he accidentally 
kicked.

3443
02:32:24,850 --> 02:32:26,640
He made a bunch of bullshit for 
delivery.

3444
02:32:26,641 --> 02:32:28,150
You can super.
Yeah.

3445
02:32:28,350 --> 02:32:31,260
He kicked her in the face like the 
cameras like right here.

3446
02:32:31,261 --> 02:32:33,480
And he hits her in the Mug.
Yeah.

3447
02:32:33,500 --> 02:32:35,700
No,
he fucked her as well.

3448
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:36,833
In his defense though,
he might've been like super frustrated 

3449
02:32:38,821 --> 02:32:39,654
if that was the case.
Someone was like flashing and his face 

3450
02:32:41,671 --> 02:32:43,830
by the way over.
And I can totally see a,

3451
02:32:43,920 --> 02:32:45,210
you know,
losing your shit on stage.

3452
02:32:45,211 --> 02:32:46,980
I think it's happened to everybody to 
see it,

3453
02:32:47,070 --> 02:32:48,840
but it's not okay.
Kick it.

3454
02:32:48,841 --> 02:32:49,621
So no,
no,

3455
02:32:49,621 --> 02:32:50,454
no.
Something I've wanted to kick someone 

3456
02:32:53,070 --> 02:32:54,180
have you for sure.

3457
02:32:54,210 --> 02:32:56,280
I mean over the course of a whole 
career.

3458
02:32:56,290 --> 02:32:58,140
Yeah.
I've wanted to kick someone.

3459
02:32:58,440 --> 02:32:59,280
You know,
it's interesting.

3460
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:02,490
I watched a,
I did long beach.

3461
02:33:02,610 --> 02:33:03,690
I did that.
Um,

3462
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:08,640
was it the terrace theater?
Forget what theater is in Long Beach.

3463
02:33:08,641 --> 02:33:11,130
Big Ass theatre in Long Beach.
Great Theater.

3464
02:33:11,340 --> 02:33:15,300
Really weird because there's no,
you could never have this theater today.

3465
02:33:15,301 --> 02:33:16,134
It will be completely illegal because 
there's the way to get out like the 

3466
02:33:19,981 --> 02:33:24,480
rose,
the rose or like 70 seats long.

3467
02:33:24,960 --> 02:33:28,950
And there's no aisle in the middles.
There's eye on the left side.

3468
02:33:28,951 --> 02:33:29,784
I on the right side.
But the whole span in front of you is 

3469
02:33:32,371 --> 02:33:34,740
just seats.
It's amazing to perform there.

3470
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:35,960
It's still there.
Yeah,

3471
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:37,860
that's the place.
Yeah.

3472
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:38,431
God,
yeah,

3473
02:33:38,431 --> 02:33:39,540
look at that.
Oh yeah.

3474
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:41,010
Crazy man.
You got to get up,

3475
02:33:41,011 --> 02:33:42,240
take a picture.
You got to Piss in your,

3476
02:33:42,241 --> 02:33:43,440
in the middle.
You're fucked.

3477
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:46,650
You 40 people,
especially if you're overweight,

3478
02:33:46,680 --> 02:33:49,170
if you're a big fella and you trying to 
get through all that.

3479
02:33:49,660 --> 02:33:51,030
Um,
but anyway,

3480
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:52,980
when I went there,
uh,

3481
02:33:53,450 --> 02:33:54,283
they,
they informed me that that was where 

3482
02:33:55,621 --> 02:33:59,270
Richard Pryor did his live in concert 
from 79.

3483
02:33:59,640 --> 02:34:00,473
That's rerecorded.
And I went back and watched it after I 

3484
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:04,740
got home and I was like,
holy shit,

3485
02:34:04,741 --> 02:34:05,574
this is crazy.
He pulled up to the same doc where I 

3486
02:34:07,291 --> 02:34:09,480
pulled up.
He walks in with his wife,

3487
02:34:09,481 --> 02:34:11,610
goes to the same back area that I went 
to.

3488
02:34:12,030 --> 02:34:16,470
Then I watch it and in the beginning of 
it there's a fucking guy in the front of

3489
02:34:16,471 --> 02:34:17,950
the stage who's getting

3490
02:34:17,990 --> 02:34:18,823
like Richard Pryor is on stage and he's 
standing there taking pictures of 

3491
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:26,110
Richard Pryor while he's filling 
especial and Richard Richard's going sit

3492
02:34:26,111 --> 02:34:26,920
down,
motherfucker.

3493
02:34:26,920 --> 02:34:29,080
Stop taking my picture.
Like he's saying,

3494
02:34:29,310 --> 02:34:31,750
even in [inaudible] 79,
it was an issue.

3495
02:34:32,280 --> 02:34:34,240
I'll take a picture and it's just a guy 
in the audience.

3496
02:34:34,241 --> 02:34:35,074
It's not a professional photographer.
What do you think that phone thing are 

3497
02:34:36,821 --> 02:34:38,050
you going to do that?
Yes,

3498
02:34:38,080 --> 02:34:39,330
I'm doing that.
You are that,

3499
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:40,240
that is.
Oh,

3500
02:34:40,241 --> 02:34:41,320
okay.
I should probably tell people,

3501
02:34:41,730 --> 02:34:44,710
um,
for my shows upcoming in Austin,

3502
02:34:44,770 --> 02:34:47,140
Houston and Durham,
North Carolina.

3503
02:34:47,410 --> 02:34:49,860
There's a company called Yonder.
Yeah.

3504
02:34:49,930 --> 02:34:50,763
They take your phone,
they put it into a bag and you keep 

3505
02:34:54,401 --> 02:34:55,570
your.
Keep your phone,

3506
02:34:55,690 --> 02:34:57,670
but they have to open your bag when you 
leave.

3507
02:34:57,671 --> 02:35:00,520
So you're not making any phone calls.
You're not doing any tax.

3508
02:35:00,521 --> 02:35:02,290
You're not filming,
you're not doing anything.

3509
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:06,820
I watched Chappelle special when 
Chappelle did that and I was like,

3510
02:35:06,821 --> 02:35:07,654
this is it.

3511
02:35:07,830 --> 02:35:11,380
Yeah.
And it was fucking amazing how much more

3512
02:35:11,710 --> 02:35:14,650
tuned in people are like when they don't
have their phone.

3513
02:35:14,770 --> 02:35:15,603
Yeah.
Especially it just checking your texts 

3514
02:35:17,081 --> 02:35:18,550
and every time you're on stage.
I mean,

3515
02:35:18,551 --> 02:35:21,450
how many times are people just standing 
there filming things?

3516
02:35:21,451 --> 02:35:26,451
So I just did a show where it was like 
fourth row dark house and you just see,

3517
02:35:28,190 --> 02:35:32,460
see the light fucking beacon of light 
and I was like doing,

3518
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:33,250
I'm doing,
I'm talking,

3519
02:35:33,250 --> 02:35:37,060
I'm talking and then just like trying to
finish a bit and then I did it.

3520
02:35:37,061 --> 02:35:37,894
I'm like,
hey man,

3521
02:35:38,350 --> 02:35:39,940
what are you doing?
What,

3522
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:41,860
what are you,
what are you doing?

3523
02:35:42,190 --> 02:35:43,023
He's not even listening.
When I asked him what he's doing and 

3524
02:35:45,011 --> 02:35:46,870
then his friends were like,
Hey,

3525
02:35:46,871 --> 02:35:47,501
he looks up,
I go,

3526
02:35:47,501 --> 02:35:51,160
what are you doing for work?
I go,

3527
02:35:51,170 --> 02:35:54,940
you bought these tickets to do work?
And he was like,

3528
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:56,320
I just,
I got to do it.

3529
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:57,220
I go,
no,

3530
02:35:57,700 --> 02:35:59,620
no,
you had lighting up the whole room,

3531
02:35:59,621 --> 02:36:00,800
like always believed.
Don't realize that.

3532
02:36:00,810 --> 02:36:02,350
Go.
There's like 15 minutes left.

3533
02:36:03,010 --> 02:36:04,410
And he's like,
alright.

3534
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:08,290
And he flipped it over,
put the phone down,

3535
02:36:09,190 --> 02:36:12,280
not not two minutes later he's back on 
his phone,

3536
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:14,043
back on it back doing things that I was 
like and I actually knew to not say 

3537
02:36:16,781 --> 02:36:20,170
anything at the second time because I 
didn't want to.

3538
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:23,050
I didn't want the show to be about that 
because I was like,

3539
02:36:23,070 --> 02:36:25,420
this is going to be negative.
Right.

3540
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:28,230
But thankfully the staff noticed and 
they went over there and,

3541
02:36:28,270 --> 02:36:29,080
and I don't know,
Tom,

3542
02:36:29,080 --> 02:36:31,780
I'm doing this from now on.
I think this phone thing,

3543
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:34,690
some people don't like it.
That's okay,

3544
02:36:34,691 --> 02:36:35,524
but it's gonna make a better show.
Here's the thing so that people know 

3545
02:36:37,001 --> 02:36:39,010
because I know a little bit about the 
honor thing too,

3546
02:36:39,011 --> 02:36:40,060
is like if you're like,
well,

3547
02:36:40,061 --> 02:36:40,960
what if I need to.

3548
02:36:41,020 --> 02:36:43,780
You can actually.
You can leave the showroom.

3549
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:45,550
Yeah.
And they'll unlock it for you.

3550
02:36:45,551 --> 02:36:47,020
You can make your call.
Yeah.

3551
02:36:47,110 --> 02:36:47,943
In the lobby,
but it's just keeping people tuned in 

3552
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:56,120
and not distracting people.
I went to see a love the Beatles show at

3553
02:36:56,480 --> 02:36:58,570
the Mirage.
Fucking amazing.

3554
02:36:58,571 --> 02:37:01,480
The cirque Du Soleil show is incredible.
Incredible.

3555
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:02,613
This guy in front of me has this 
brightness Jack to the fucking roof and 

3556
02:37:06,521 --> 02:37:10,570
he's texting people like,
so while I'm trying to watch the show,

3557
02:37:10,780 --> 02:37:14,800
this guy has this bright phone and he's 
just sitting there texting.

3558
02:37:14,801 --> 02:37:16,190
Yeah.
All over and over and over again.

3559
02:37:16,191 --> 02:37:18,560
Completely disrespecting all the people 
around him.

3560
02:37:18,710 --> 02:37:21,980
Everybody's just got to go like this 
because the place is pitch black,

3561
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:25,160
so a lot of this stuff is going on 
because there's like there's stuff comes

3562
02:37:25,161 --> 02:37:25,994
down from the ceiling and people are 
descending and they're doing this 

3563
02:37:28,371 --> 02:37:31,850
acrobatics and this Dick had is just 
constantly on his fucking phone.

3564
02:37:31,970 --> 02:37:32,803
Yeah.
It's like just do you want to fucking 

3565
02:37:34,610 --> 02:37:37,370
experience things for a minute?
You know what I mean?

3566
02:37:37,371 --> 02:37:39,860
Like you go to Cirque du Soleil or you 
go to Joe Rogan's show,

3567
02:37:39,861 --> 02:37:43,130
it's like you fucking.
When you decided to go to the thing like

3568
02:37:43,131 --> 02:37:44,980
don't you want to experience the show?
Yeah,

3569
02:37:45,170 --> 02:37:46,003
just watched the show for a minute.
You got to force people because there's 

3570
02:37:48,261 --> 02:37:50,180
a certain amount of people that are just
not going to.

3571
02:37:50,230 --> 02:37:52,670
You're getting a deal.
It's not cheap.

3572
02:37:52,730 --> 02:37:54,260
It's not cheap.
It costs money.

3573
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:56,570
Yeah.
But I feel like it's gonna be worth it.

3574
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,220
I think so too,
and I'm definitely going to do it for my

3575
02:37:58,221 --> 02:37:59,660
special.
Oh yeah,

3576
02:37:59,910 --> 02:38:00,743
I'm good.
I understand it from now on because my 

3577
02:38:03,111 --> 02:38:07,000
last two specials I dealt with people 
sitting in the front row and second road

3578
02:38:07,001 --> 02:38:09,290
is standing there holding that phone up 
in front of you,

3579
02:38:09,800 --> 02:38:11,150
holding it right at you.

3580
02:38:11,150 --> 02:38:14,150
Like you don't think that's distracting.
You don't think that's weird.

3581
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:18,200
Live your life I think is especially 
good thing to do in a big,

3582
02:38:18,530 --> 02:38:19,550
big venue.
Yeah,

3583
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:20,513
yeah.
Yeah.

3584
02:38:20,810 --> 02:38:23,930
So that's it folks.
So if you come into a Austin,

3585
02:38:23,931 --> 02:38:27,170
Houston,
and Durham for taking your phone and put

3586
02:38:27,171 --> 02:38:28,700
it in a bag,
phone up.

3587
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:31,710
Keep that phone up.
Give me that.

3588
02:38:32,540 --> 02:38:34,100
You did.
You're special in Denver,

3589
02:38:34,101 --> 02:38:35,060
right?
At the paramount.

3590
02:38:35,061 --> 02:38:36,380
Yeah.
It's fucking great place.

3591
02:38:36,410 --> 02:38:38,120
It's great.
I love that shit.

3592
02:38:38,750 --> 02:38:40,400
It's still.
It's still my favorite man.

3593
02:38:40,460 --> 02:38:43,850
It's my favorite city.
I think if I moved anywhere it'll either

3594
02:38:43,851 --> 02:38:47,690
be there or maybe seattle.
Those are my spots.

3595
02:38:47,720 --> 02:38:50,690
I would love to live.
I love actually downtown Denver.

3596
02:38:50,691 --> 02:38:54,020
I would also think it'd be amazing to 
live like 20 minutes outside of Denver.

3597
02:38:54,050 --> 02:38:56,290
Yeah,
go to golden.

3598
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:58,540
Live in the woods.
Be Amazing.

3599
02:38:59,500 --> 02:39:00,130
I really think.

3600
02:39:00,130 --> 02:39:02,750
I think it's in my future.
Do I?

3601
02:39:02,790 --> 02:39:04,760
Do?
You're going to bail out in California.

3602
02:39:06,330 --> 02:39:08,390
I don't think I'm gonna do it in like 
the next couple of years,

3603
02:39:08,510 --> 02:39:10,940
but I think in my life I will move to 
Colorado at some point.

3604
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:12,770
Um,
yeah,

3605
02:39:13,310 --> 02:39:16,190
I really love it.
I love to all aspects of it.

3606
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:18,860
Like I like the culture.
I like,

3607
02:39:19,190 --> 02:39:22,040
I like the outdoors.
I liked the people that I meet.

3608
02:39:22,041 --> 02:39:24,140
They're always had great people there.
Yeah.

3609
02:39:24,380 --> 02:39:27,170
They have all the infrastructure you 
want from a big city.

3610
02:39:27,171 --> 02:39:28,920
You have access to everything.
Oh yeah.

3611
02:39:29,180 --> 02:39:31,140
Great restaurants you have great.
Uh,

3612
02:39:31,540 --> 02:39:32,840
you know,
the big sports,

3613
02:39:32,841 --> 02:39:33,910
they have entertainment.
They have,

3614
02:39:33,930 --> 02:39:36,350
they have everything you want.
The people are cool as fuck too.

3615
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:37,820
They really are.
It's just,

3616
02:39:38,270 --> 02:39:39,103
they're not pretentious.
Like a lot of people that live in la or 

3617
02:39:42,321 --> 02:39:45,920
San Francisco or New York,
they're very laid back,

3618
02:39:46,310 --> 02:39:48,770
but you know,
they're surrounded by also.

3619
02:39:48,770 --> 02:39:51,350
I think there's something about being 
surrounded by the rocky mountains.

3620
02:39:51,470 --> 02:39:53,550
I think it's good.
Start taking yourself seriously.

3621
02:39:53,551 --> 02:39:55,310
You just look out and go,
Oh yeah,

3622
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:58,470
fucking the vastness of all this.
It's incredible.

3623
02:39:58,790 --> 02:40:01,460
There's a great nightmare.
I had such a fucking lucky night.

3624
02:40:01,461 --> 02:40:03,770
It was an awesome night to do the 
special.

3625
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:04,783
I'm trying to do red rocks,
but every time I look for a date I got 

3626
02:40:07,741 --> 02:40:11,450
to look to three years in advance.
It's like Tuesday and Wednesday nights.

3627
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:12,313
I heard about that.
I was talking to them about red rocks 

3628
02:40:14,430 --> 02:40:15,263
and they're like,
people will take a date they don't even 

3629
02:40:18,571 --> 02:40:22,270
want because it's years in advance.
Yeah,

3630
02:40:22,530 --> 02:40:23,363
well that's what they offered me.
They offered me a bunch of Tuesdays and 

3631
02:40:25,291 --> 02:40:27,810
Wednesdays and they're not in the in 
like in 20,

3632
02:40:27,811 --> 02:40:29,790
20 or something.
Twenty 19.

3633
02:40:29,880 --> 02:40:31,690
There's like Tuesdays and Wednesdays and
29.

3634
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:33,000
That's all that's available.
Yeah.

3635
02:40:33,480 --> 02:40:34,231
Wow.
I was like,

3636
02:40:34,231 --> 02:40:36,310
I can't get a Friday.
Yeah,

3637
02:40:36,720 --> 02:40:39,120
but the Belko the place that I do 
normally.

3638
02:40:39,150 --> 02:40:40,110
Yeah,
I liked that too,

3639
02:40:40,410 --> 02:40:45,410
but that's like 5,000 something.
Whereas red rock is like 9,000.

3640
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:49,660
It's a lot.
But.

3641
02:40:49,810 --> 02:40:51,990
But you were doing to bell to Bell Co's?
Yeah.

3642
02:40:51,991 --> 02:40:53,330
That's $10,000.
No,

3643
02:40:53,340 --> 02:40:54,660
it's not.
I can do enough people,

3644
02:40:54,661 --> 02:40:58,350
but it's just.
I like people want to go out on Saturday

3645
02:40:58,351 --> 02:40:59,101
night.
Yeah.

3646
02:40:59,101 --> 02:40:59,934
They want to go out and Friday night 
they don't want to go on fucking 

3647
02:41:01,321 --> 02:41:02,400
Wednesday.
Yeah,

3648
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:04,170
hi to them.
Some weird.

3649
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:06,360
Have you been out to red rocks 
amphitheatre?

3650
02:41:06,690 --> 02:41:07,523
No.
Yeah.

3651
02:41:07,860 --> 02:41:09,490
We need those to be the shit that.
Yeah,

3652
02:41:09,491 --> 02:41:10,350
I heard.
It's incredible.

3653
02:41:10,351 --> 02:41:13,020
Brian Regan was in and he was telling me
how he performed there.

3654
02:41:13,120 --> 02:41:13,953
There's video of it.
He made like a whole film but really 

3655
02:41:15,721 --> 02:41:16,980
loved it.
So it was amazing.

3656
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:19,080
Not a lot of comedians perform there 
though.

3657
02:41:19,081 --> 02:41:20,490
It's pretty.
It's pretty special.

3658
02:41:20,491 --> 02:41:21,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

3659
02:41:21,420 --> 02:41:22,920
What's it got to be?
You got to do it.

3660
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:24,930
Yeah.
All right.

3661
02:41:24,931 --> 02:41:28,260
Well let's wrap this bitch up everybody 
tomorrow.

3662
02:41:28,410 --> 02:41:30,630
Meaning tonight,
midnight tonight.

3663
02:41:30,930 --> 02:41:34,260
The great and powerful Tommy Buttons 
special comes out on Netflix.

3664
02:41:34,860 --> 02:41:36,810
Don't sleep.
This is what you do.

3665
02:41:36,990 --> 02:41:39,570
You get up early and you watched the 
last one first.

3666
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:42,750
Yeah.
Mostly stories get jacked up.

3667
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:45,930
That'll be a warmup.
And then describe why disgraceful.

3668
02:41:46,050 --> 02:41:46,883
It's how my mother described my standup.
One time she came and saw me on this 

3669
02:41:55,681 --> 02:41:57,810
tour and she saw,
you know,

3670
02:41:57,811 --> 02:41:59,460
like when your parents come and you're 
like,

3671
02:41:59,461 --> 02:42:00,730
ah man,
you know,

3672
02:42:00,731 --> 02:42:01,770
and uh,
you know,

3673
02:42:01,830 --> 02:42:04,170
it was a good one,
like she came to a good show,

3674
02:42:04,290 --> 02:42:05,123
right?
And they came backstage and it was like 

3675
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:11,460
my dad was,
a lot of people are buddy kind of money.

3676
02:42:11,460 --> 02:42:14,160
You get something like this total dad 
question.

3677
02:42:15,170 --> 02:42:18,210
And my mom was,
I was having,

3678
02:42:18,400 --> 02:42:23,400
we think mom and she was like,
amazing battle your language.

3679
02:42:23,660 --> 02:42:25,700
It's like if these bullets,
no,

3680
02:42:25,740 --> 02:42:30,740
if,
if you said these case was like thinking

3681
02:42:30,811 --> 02:42:31,950
of titles.
And I was like,

3682
02:42:31,980 --> 02:42:32,870
oh,
I love upsetting.

3683
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:36,860
So I called it disgraceful.
Various.

3684
02:42:36,990 --> 02:42:38,930
Your mother has a strong Spanish accent,
right?

3685
02:42:38,931 --> 02:42:40,350
Very strong.
That's funny.

3686
02:42:40,351 --> 02:42:41,184
Yeah.
Yeah.

3687
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:46,260
When you speak Spanish in front of you.
I've talked to people about it before,

3688
02:42:46,261 --> 02:42:50,640
but it's funny when you speak Spanish in
front to people that didn't expect it.

3689
02:42:50,670 --> 02:42:51,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

3690
02:42:51,360 --> 02:42:52,830
I talk about it in the special.
Oh yeah.

3691
02:42:52,900 --> 02:42:53,733
Yeah.
I have a bit of bad.

3692
02:42:54,950 --> 02:42:56,670
Yeah,
because it throws them off guard.

3693
02:42:58,020 --> 02:42:59,400
They're like,
how do you do that?

3694
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:02,430
He looks so white.
I know,

3695
02:43:02,550 --> 02:43:04,740
I know.
And then my sisters are darker,

3696
02:43:04,741 --> 02:43:06,330
like they have a darker complexion than 
me.

3697
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:06,991
Oh,
do they?

3698
02:43:06,991 --> 02:43:07,351
Yeah.
Yeah.

3699
02:43:07,351 --> 02:43:10,770
Especially if we go,
like if we go into the sun for a few,

3700
02:43:11,710 --> 02:43:15,610
they turn in the fucking incas and just 
burned.

3701
02:43:15,940 --> 02:43:16,773
So yeah,
it's very just you could tell it's just 

3702
02:43:19,331 --> 02:43:20,164
genetics.
I got like my dad's skin and they got 

3703
02:43:21,950 --> 02:43:24,160
hers.
Alright Ladies and gentlemen,

3704

Midnight.

3705

Tommy bonds on Netflix.
Don't sleep.
