1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,330
That was,
you looked at that.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,120
This is the move point break.
Cupcake shirt point bake and we working.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,163
Yeah,
it's working.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,730
Yeah,
we live.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,290
We,
I wish we could start this show off with

6
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,600
flavor and you're here.
What do we get kicked off of Youtube.

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,360
Craig mack died.
That's just a shout out.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,330
I know.
I feel like we should be able to,

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:35,250
just as a shout out.
It is a great fucking song,

10
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,240
man.
It was such a good song.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,850
Dude was only 46 what was it?
I didn't even see what he died of.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,580
Heart attack.
Yeah.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,890
Heart failure.
46 fuck man.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,510
Major.
But we start off the show with a major

15
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,344
bummer.
Yeah.

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,030
We will get pulled by youtube.
Right?

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,250
If we did that,
we played it for sure.

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,740
We,
I'm sure for sure we won't play.

19
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,800
It won't play.
Let's just shout out to Craig back.

20
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,110
You know what you could do?
You could play like someone else who did

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,570
their version of it.
It should have been even then you'd

22
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:01,500
probably get,
there he is.

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,600
Oh,
oh biggies.

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Now this is the,
this is the,

25
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,123
yeah,
I dunno.

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,180
With notorious lol and bless a bless.
No Shit.

27
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,061
Yeah,
don't,

28
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:16,650
don't,
don't put that up on youtube is it

29
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:20,400
already had been up.
Okay,

30
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,820
good.
Everybody's dying.

31
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,010
46 is so young to have a fucking heart
attack heart stuff.

32
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,370
That's everybody.
I guess I should have just guessed hard

33
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,330
shit.
Well,

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,250
especially in this day and age,
the way people eat terrible.

35
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:39,900
He wasn't,
was he that heavy of a dude?

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,840
I don't think you have to be that heavy
with dude clogged arteries.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
But then there's super,
super heavy dudes that just had nothing

38
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:46,340
fun,
nothing phases them.

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,480
There's some guys that just keep on
trucking.

40
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,200
That's like in Chicago where I'm from.
That's everybody I know.

41
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,580
Oh yeah.
Nobody skinny is offensive.

42
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,940
Well not only that,
it gets zero degrees all day long.

43
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,530
So fucking four months.
Yeah,

44
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,780
you need the padding.
They need something he needed to sell.

45
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,880
You need somewhere to hide all that
sadness,

46
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,970
shove it underneath all this guy has
gray.

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,130
You hear bullets from the south side.
So when I got,

48
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:10,320
when I got in a little bit of shape and
I went back to Chicago,

49
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:13,350
I caught this like so much shit for that
from everybody.

50
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,660
You sell out Mr Hollywood.
Well you look,

51
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,580
you look in lane eaten,
eaten well,

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,620
we eat an avocado.
Caring about your future.

53
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,340
What does it say Jamie?
What are you six?

54
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,260
No cause of death was immediately
released hill for a while.

55
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:27,210
So that's what I saw.
I saw they didn't figure it out yet.

56
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,070
Oh I saw something on.
Yeah,

57
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,950
see that's a problem when someone,
you get a bunch of different versions of

58
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,060
the story.
Um,

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,280
I went down and Internet rabbit hole
last night.

60
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:36,870
Man,
this is a very disturbing one.

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,510
Do you know anything?
What's going on in Boyle Heights?

62
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,280
No.
Boyle Heights.

63
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:43,080
East la,
east La.

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,190
And um,
apparently the hipsters are starting to

65
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:52,191
open up our teas and old coffee shops
and art galleries there and they're not

66
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:54,340
having it.
And uh,

67
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,230
the gayborhood is pushing back.
It's more than that.

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,100
There's a lot of,
it's like straight

69
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,530
up racist.
It's anti white racism,

70
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:04,450
which is apparently co totally
acceptable.

71
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,250
You don't have cameras are blaring in
your face.

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,050
Uh,
we'll boil heights,

73
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,160
be ruined by one coffee shop.
It's not just one coffee shop.

74
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,590
They forced a gallery under.
Is this an older story from June's?

75
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,220
Yeah,
they forced a gallery out just through

76
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:22,000
constant harassment and they broke the
windows of this coffee shop and,

77
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,800
but what I watched last night there was
disturbing was these air quote activists

78
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,250
standing in front of this gallery.
It's a fucking art gallery.

79
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,413
And they're screaming,

80
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,810
get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out of our neighborhood.

81
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,780
Get the fuck out.
We don't want you here.

82
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,640
And the guy was like trying to talk to
him like,

83
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,470
you know,
some hipster guys like,

84
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,100
you know,
I'm,

85
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,800
I identify as a feminist,
like one of those guys identify as a

86
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,551
feminist,
you know,

87
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:47,610
one of those guys.
And he was like,

88
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,240
yes,
I'm here to support.

89
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,300
I'm here to support the me.
We all fuck it.

90
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:55,380
Why don't you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out there chanting,

91
00:03:55,381 --> 00:03:58,060
get the fuck out.
Get the fuck to chant,

92
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,100
get the fuck out.
It's a great chance to put up a sign

93
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,580
that says,
fuck white art,

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,260
white fuck white art.
The coffee shop,

95
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,810
they broke the windows here.
The coffee shop was even more fucked up

96
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:11,000
cause one of the guys is actually a
Mexican slopper.

97
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,190
No,
they fucked up proper.

98
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:12,551
Okay.
Right?

99
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:13,810
Yeah.
One of the guys who were in the coffee

100
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:14,770
shop,
they were calling it,

101
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,540
it's,
they called it like weird coffee or

102
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:20,320
something like that and neither they,
they put a sign on a calling it white

103
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,670
coffee and they broke the window.

104
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,160
But one of the guys who owns it is
Latino.

105
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,810
I don't know if he's Mexican,
but he's definitely,

106
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,730
it'd be funny to open up a spot called
white coffee.

107
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,180
Yeah.
White people come and people just called

108
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:32,590
white people problems.
Look,

109
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:36,490
a new generation of anti gentrification,
radicals are on the march in Los Angeles

110
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,110
and around the city.
This is not a diet is not an accurate

111
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,610
way to frame what's happening.
No,

112
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:45,040
that's crazy.
This is not anti gentrification

113
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,300
radicals.
These are,

114
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,020
these are rioters and then writing.
These people have fire in their hands or

115
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:53,350
walking on the street and they're
yelling at a bunch of racist shit and

116
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,910
they covered their faces up.
Look,

117
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,980
I get it.
I get what's going on.

118
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,540
Like they're,
they're afraid they're gonna lose their

119
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,150
neighborhood and they're afraid their
neighborhood's going to be pushed out.

120
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,140
The dinosaurs felt the same way.
So did so did cavemen.

121
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,700
Everybody feels the same way.
The world is a fucking fluid moving

122
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:11,950
thing.
You can't just save neighborhoods

123
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:13,630
forever.
It just doesn't work that way.

124
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,250
You can't save anything forever.
No.

125
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,000
I mean,
and there's nothing wrong with a God

126
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:18,940
damn gallery moving into your
neighborhood.

127
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,900
That's crazy.

128
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,030
Right?
That's right.

129
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,660
Right.
Like I fuck,

130
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,470
I see it when people do this whole thing
about like Walmart's moving into small

131
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:26,970
towns and that they lose,
they panic.

132
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,430
Like I get that.
I understand it's changing industry.

133
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:33,700
A dude selling fucking lattes is not
going to dynamically shape and,

134
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,290
and if it does,
it'll take 15 more.

135
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,400
Yeah,
it'll take 15 more years,

136
00:05:37,401 --> 00:05:39,590
but they know it's coming.
They know what happens in these

137
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:42,440
neighborhoods.
It's like these hipsters move in first

138
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,650
because La real estate is so ridiculous.
It doesn't make like I was looking at

139
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,660
uh,
places near where Carolyn lives count

140
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,830
lives in Santa Monica and I was looking
places he lives above ground.

141
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,050
Yes,
I know,

142
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,980
right.
He lived in like the

143
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,190
sewer system or something like that.
Like one of them Ninja Turtles,

144
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,520
a turtle account live on the beef is
scoring system.

145
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,130
He lives in a very nice neighborhood.
I mean I'm not,

146
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:11,540
but I was just looking in Santa Monica
in general and a regular house,

147
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,790
like a regular house.
It's $2 million.

148
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,580
Yeah.
Bullshit house like was a fucking normal

149
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:18,860
house house.
Nothing like you be like,

150
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,400
you can bring a a gal back home like hey
my house,

151
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,300
you know,
look at the view of the city.

152
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,760
No,
there's none of that around $2 million.

153
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,110
You get a shack.
Two bed,

154
00:06:27,111 --> 00:06:28,490
one and a half bath.
Yeah.

155
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,240
With fucking old bullshit linoleum.
Yeah.

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,580
Shitty sync with the ring.
Where at the fucking water.

157
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,180
The dirt has just stayed in those old la
La loves doing like,

158
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,680
uh,
in the 60s.

159
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,460
They love doing like a or in the 50s
maybe pink light pink and green

160
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:44,030
bathrooms.

161
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,520
So it was like pink tile and they leave
that and I was just looking today it's

162
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,250
Deco's at arc tech or just or just bad
decision making.

163
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,490
And I was looking at a place today just
before I came here.

164
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,000
Guys looking just Hollywood hills on the
other side.

165
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,471
Yeah.
It's just,

166
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:58,940
it's a nice,
but it's a nightmare.

167
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,030
All that stuff.
Can you think about,

168
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,160
they're like,
oh the drainage.

169
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,520
I went to a super rich dudes house.
How much does that one take?

170
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,140
A guess.
$2 million.

171
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,150
A little more.
2.2 well you know why?

172
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,470
Cause it's a Duplo they split it.
It,

173
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,680
it.
Those are two apartments they rent,

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,180
right?
Is that what it is?

175
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,490
Yeah.
That's to one side is a door or the

176
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,840
right and left or doors.
Is that,

177
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,560
yeah.
Yeah.

178
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,660
So what La does is they take these old
buildings,

179
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,610
split them like that so then they can
make twice the money.

180
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,310
The property is,
the property can't be worth that much.

181
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,320
It's just the fact that they can rent it
to two people.

182
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,790
That's a lot of money,
man.

183
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,290
Oh my God.
This is 1.5 0.5 how big is it?

184
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,760
A thousand square feet.
Square feet one.

185
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,520
That's the size of this studio,
right?

186
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,670
That's the size of where the mics are
inside of here.

187
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,430
It's pretty close.
A thousand square feet is really,

188
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,460
I mean,
if you're one dude living by yourself,

189
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,990
like maybe you got a dog.
Yeah,

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,580
but like didn't that one dude would just
rent?

191
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,880
He probably should,
unless he's just real simple.

192
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:55,610
Like there's those people that buy those
miniature houses.

193
00:07:55,611 --> 00:07:58,940
Ever seen those tiny house,
tiny house that you want to talk about?

194
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:00,380
Warm whole shit.
I got it.

195
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,480
I ended that so deep,
Dude.

196
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,260
I was like,
what if I did dance?

197
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,260
What if I did tell me how shit.

198
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,910
It's why,
you know there's a show that I'm

199
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:09,980
addicted to.
It's called life below zero.

200
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,430
I watched three episodes.
What is it that people in Alaska,

201
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,000
I love that show.
I watched two episodes the other day in

202
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:18,050
one,
actually yesterday,

203
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,740
but the one I watched yesterday,
there's this dude who lives in a place

204
00:08:21,741 --> 00:08:24,410
called,
I think it's called Shandell are it's

205
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,950
way above the Arctic circle and it's
fucking guy lives by himself and

206
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,590
apparently he used to be married and he
has kids somewhere.

207
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,830
Yeah,
his name's Glenn Glenville new or

208
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:36,140
something like shout out to Glenn Smart
too too,

209
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,200
which is weird.
He lives solo so low.

210
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,640
No one's around.
He lives in a room.

211
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,930
Not even half that.
That's,

212
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,210
that's homeboy right there.
He lives in a room,

213
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,260
not even half the size of this studio
and he just has a bunch of shit like

214
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,200
stacked in that rule.
I maybe it's like I'm exaggerating.

215
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:54,430
Maybe it's half the size.
That's his tent above the artists naked

216
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,770
there.
There's a song

217
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,560
this hog,
let's show his diesel Odis.

218
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,900
See,
here's the thing about these things.

219
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:04,560
Like you got to realize that on these
shows there's a lot of the stuff they do

220
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:06,780
is just bullshit.
They just do it for camera.

221
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,820
Like what would it be?
Good episode today.

222
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,380
Well,
maybe I can make my own sauna.

223
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,243
Yeah.
Make a song.

224
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,620
Like what?
He'd be really be making a sauna.

225
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,710
I don't know.
But what this guy does is just,

226
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,080
he goes out and shoots Moose and
Caribou.

227
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,790
Oh,
he eats almost exclusively meat.

228
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,550
He lives where there's fucking no
plants.

229
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,220
I mean there's trees grow.
You're not growing Jack Shit.

230
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,790
Wolves in his yard.
He had a shoot wolves once they were in

231
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:30,450
his backyard.
Yeah,

232
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,280
to shoot them because they were coming
for his food.

233
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,890
I see him training the wolf's.
He starts training heaven.

234
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,800
Shit.
So you don't really train wolfs he

235
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:40,620
trained those bitch ass half wolves that
become dogs.

236
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,880
Right.
That's they turn into,

237
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,130
they turn it to uh,
his,

238
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,700
uh,
his sauna.

239
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:47,760
Wolf's Hisana dogs.
Unless you're like beastmaster you have

240
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:50,250
like a special bracelet and you walk
through the forest and they'll follow

241
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:52,490
you.
They kind of want it to be that right.

242
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,200
Never.
Beastmaster you remember that show?

243
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,260
Fucking do like always had like a hawk
landing on his shoulder and shit.

244
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,600
Just go like this and a bird land on
him.

245
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,290
Yeah.
It didn't have like a fucking mountain

246
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,360
lion or something that hung around with
them too and walk with them.

247
00:10:06,361 --> 00:10:07,590
Everyone's guardian.
Yeah,

248
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,170
like here he is.
Yeah,

249
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,090
those fair,
those ferrets are like a pigeon kite

250
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:13,320
pigeons in New York.
You know what I mean?

251
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,540
The parents distribute messages
throughout the forest.

252
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,350
Do you know ferrets were illegal in some
places for a while as to pets.

253
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,770
Too much anal,
but people shoving him up their ass.

254
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,650
I don't think that's fair.
It's they'll get them with a hawk on his

255
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:27,480
hand.
Is that an eagle looked at up.

256
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,160
Why do people,
why were ferreted league?

257
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,960
I got it.
Nobody thought they were aggressive,

258
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,090
which is hilarious.
And you think about how many dogs people

259
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,430
have that are just ridiculously faces
off and shit.

260
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,650
I fucking golden retriever attack my
golden retriever and bite his face when

261
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:42,770
we were on a run the other day.
What do you do?

262
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,020
I just pulled them apart and he yelled
at the guy who controls fucking dog and

263
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,860
what does he do?
The guy was so weak like he,

264
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,360
the dog polled and the guy comically
fell to his ass,

265
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,170
feet up in the air from a dog and meets
a 70 pound dog.

266
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,120
It's not a big dog.
Yankton right out.

267
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,110
He said like the dog is a problem and it
bites things and tries to bite people.

268
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,640
I'm like,
well you got a bad dog van.

269
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,950
Put a fucking muzzle on it or something
or figure it out,

270
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,630
but he can't even hold the dog.
Like there's people that have animals

271
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,790
that they're just hoping nothing goes
wrong.

272
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,720
They have zero control over right thing
and this thing pulled and this guy like

273
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,721
whoop feet went flying cartoons so weak.
And then when I separated the dogs,

274
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,250
he tried to pull the dog back.
He couldn't pull the dog back.

275
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:27,540
I'm like,
come on man,

276
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,810
like you shouldn't have this dog.
It's not even a big dog.

277
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,230
You should have a fucking Chihuahua
emasculating moment for a guy to like

278
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:35,580
have another man be like,
Hey,

279
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,980
what are you doing guys?
My control your fucking dog.

280
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,870
I don't want to hurt the dog,
but the dog is biting my dog.

281
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,200
You have to stop it in some ways to do
something in some way.

282
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,330
So if it takes two instincts,
instinct number one is like kick it and

283
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,990
knock it away.
Push it away.

284
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,200
Instinct number two is grab a rock and
smash this fucking thing.

285
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,070
It's that passion.
Fighting

286
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,903
that instinct.
Yeah,

287
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,890
because that dog is like my little
buddy.

288
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,400
You have to protect yours.
Yes.

289
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,670
Well he's a sweetie too.
Like he doesn't,

290
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,850
he's not grounded in anything,
any time ever.

291
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,050
Right.
This is just a fun,

292
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,990
just got attacked.
Happy dog and this dog's biting onto his

293
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:11,020
face and he's Yiping and I'm trying to
figure out what to do and this fucking

294
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,210
guy feed up in the air.
Whoops.

295
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,980
Felt that he was of no use and not.
So I have to assume this dog's not going

296
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:18,550
to do anything to me.
You know,

297
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,320
it's biting me.
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with

298
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:23,200
his dog and wants a bite another cause
it's not a pit bull or something like

299
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,580
that.
If it was a pit bull,

300
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,930
I would have known like,
okay,

301
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:28,620
we got to go wide berth here.
Fuck away from this ring.

302
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,700
I know how those things behave,
but this is just like,

303
00:12:30,701 --> 00:12:32,770
why is this dog doing this?
That'll be the next,

304
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,920
uh,
that'll be the next like reality shows

305
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,620
fight,
fight,

306
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,453
fight.
The owner,

307
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,151
like,
you know,

308
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:38,470
the dog's getting a thing and then
you're like,

309
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:39,430
all right,
well me and you have to fight.

310
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:42,550
Now there's people,
there's people that have dogs that don't

311
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:45,070
even understand dogs.
They don't know that they have to be the

312
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:46,400
alpha.
They don't know that.

313
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,620
They don't know how to go,
hey,

314
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,260
cut the fucking shit.
Cause they just get a dog.

315
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,630
They just get a dog and they just figure
everything.

316
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,710
It'll figure itself out.
You know,

317
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:56,170
it was bad ass with dogs.
Who Whitney Cummings,

318
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,210
you know,
I just got a puppy and I called her.

319
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,370
She called,
gave me crazy good advice.

320
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:02,260
Suit.
She doesn't fuck around in her house.

321
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,860
She goes,
I walked through my dogs.

322
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,780
I don't walk around them.
I walked through them.

323
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,780
Yeah.
She goes and they don't lie on top of me

324
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,280
and they don't get to lick my face.
I was like,

325
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:10,091
whoa.
Yeah,

326
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:11,570
no,
she told me she gave doing that.

327
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:13,090
Let me tell you,
shout out to her.

328
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,970
She gave me so much great advice.
She was like,

329
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,440
I literally,
I was like,

330
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,640
hey man,
do you have a little bit of time to tell

331
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,151
me that?
And she,

332
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:20,410
she,
I mean like a computer.

333
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:20,920
She was like,
yeah,

334
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,910
dude,
don't do,

335
00:13:21,911 --> 00:13:23,590
don't do,
don't she like named everything

336
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:25,240
perfectly that she's like,
don't make this mistake.

337
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,800
Don't do this.
People do this shit all the time.

338
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,480
It's wrong.
She laid it out great.

339
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:29,980
And Nick now,
uh,

340
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,030
the puppies like almost perfectly potty
trained and I just got it.

341
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,320
I saved my best friends.

342
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,510
True adopted dogs.
Yeah.

343
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,330
She's one of the smartest people I know,
but the absolute,

344
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,920
but a puppy's an asshole.
By the way.

345
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,230
Puppies are assholes.
Puppies are assholes.

346
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,840
So hard to deal with man.
And waking up in the middle of the night

347
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,940
pissing and shitting,
wanting to piss like every two hours.

348
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,620
I know,
I know.

349
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:51,580
I know.
Trust me.

350
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,240
I was,
I blew,

351
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,370
I learned fast that I was like,
I was like,

352
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:56,590
it'll sleep a little bit.
When was the last time you had a dog?

353
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,730
Years ago.
Do you have crates to keep being

354
00:13:58,731 --> 00:13:59,290
cracked?
Right?

355
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,790
Yeah.
You've got to keep the crate thing.

356
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,190
They don't mind.
That was the thing.

357
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,180
We think what we put in the dog or the
kids know they like it.

358
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,530
They like it.
Yeah.

359
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,740
Cause they feel like,
well even when she,

360
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,990
even when she shits she finds a thing
that that feels like it's covering her.

361
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,000
She likes to be like covered when she
shit.

362
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,370
I mean she's a lady first of all.
Of course she wants to,

363
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,530
she wants to hide her shit.
What?

364
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:20,980
Same thing when she goes in the crate.
She likes it when my shirts on top of it

365
00:14:20,981 --> 00:14:22,310
cause it's like,
it feels like it's a kit,

366
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,290
a little cave.
He knows.

367
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:26,860
The most bizarre to me is people in New
York City who live in these little ass

368
00:14:26,861 --> 00:14:29,110
apartment stacked on top of each other
and they have dogs.

369
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,740
Great Danes.
And like what is the fuck is this crazy?

370
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,570
How are you doing this?
Like you have to,

371
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,570
that is a job.
You have an extra job like it's not like

372
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,340
you just let,
I can let my dog out in the yard.

373
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:40,090
Hey Buddy,
you gotta shit.

374
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,560
God open up the door.
He's gone.

375
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,020
Goes takes a shit there.
You got to take it down in an elevator

376
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,163
downstairs.

377
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,960
What if you're in a walk up,
right?

378
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,510
You're going to walk down seven flights
of stairs at two o'clock in the morning

379
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:52,070
because your dog has diarrhea.
Fuck is this.

380
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,430
This lady is walking down the street
with a God damn horse.

381
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,860
That is the one of the biggest dogs I've
ever seen.

382
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,160
What is that?
Mary lives in a 400 square foot,

383
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,420
two bed,
two bath.

384
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,760
My friend's daughter just moved to New
York City.

385
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,910
She got a job in New York City and she
moved to this place where she pays

386
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:14,870
$1,200 for a room that doesn't even have
a sink in Manhattan.

387
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,710
In Manhattan.
Yeah.

388
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,260
They have a community bathroom down the
hall.

389
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,230
She had us,
she,

390
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,660
she's a hot blade in her room and
there's no room for anything.

391
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,560
No refrigerator,
no,

392
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:25,370
none of that shit.
Oh,

393
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,420
it's a room.
No,

394
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:29,510
bought a room.
It's so little 1200 a bed.

395
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,270
There's a bed that sits there and then
there's like,

396
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:37,430
she has this little tiny area,
whereas a shelf and then she has a hot

397
00:15:37,431 --> 00:15:39,290
plate that sits on the shelf.
That's it.

398
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,820
That's it.
If you have clothes,

399
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:43,280
you got to stack them up in boxes on the
ground.

400
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:47,620
The best shitty in a World Bei Bei
$1,200 for a room.

401
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,710
If you're a kid,
like,

402
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,600
cause she's only 21.
Um,

403
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,690
think of your kid and you move to a New
York.

404
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:57,560
How much you make and what do you mean?
Are you even making 1200 bucks a month?

405
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,170
I mean,
you might make your probably clear 400

406
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:03,290
$500 a week before taxes,
right?

407
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,230
And then the taxes come.
You might be down to four,

408
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,081
right?
So you,

409
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:07,914
you,
what are you doing?

410
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,750
You're paying $1,200 and you make it 16.
You're,

411
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:15,530
you're living off of $400 a week to walk
around and take cabs and get food.

412
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,420
It's fine.
Fuck all.

413
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,120
That's literally why I moved to La.
When I started comedy,

414
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,970
I was going to go to New York and I
thought buddy was like,

415
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,970
you can be broken la and get away with
it.

416
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:25,521
Yes.
He's like,

417
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:27,240
you can't be broke in New York.
Yeah.

418
00:16:27,241 --> 00:16:29,870
When I lived in New York,
I was doing road gigs and I couldn't

419
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:32,060
afford to live in Manhattan.
So I lived in new Rochelle.

420
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,280
I got a place in new Rochelle with a
little driveway.

421
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:37,730
I went to like,
I was a bottom half of a house and um,

422
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,983
look,
uh,

423
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,240
there's like a little driveway and
parked the car right in front of my

424
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:42,680
bedroom.
So if someone fucked with it,

425
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:43,514
I could hear it.
See it.

426
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,420
Yeah.
It was the only option that wasn't cheap

427
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,670
either.
But like living in the city was just

428
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,070
impossible.
It's like hundreds of dollars a month

429
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:53,180
just for a parking spot.

430
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,570
Ever afford that.
That's why I moved to La because I saw

431
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,130
some,
someone was telling me they were like,

432
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,870
you can get away with paying 400 a month
in La to have a room in a place with

433
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:03,631
roommates.
And I was like,

434
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,620
God is perfect.
Well I think comics are doing it right.

435
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,610
Like there's a lot of like Tony
Hinchcliffe when he lived out here,

436
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,980
when he first moved here,
he lived with like three other guys and

437
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:17,360
like they all split the rent.
Small one bedroom apartment or two

438
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:20,660
bedroom apartment.
You can get away with that and it's fun.

439
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,160
It's like it is fun.
You know.

440
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:25,280
It's not fun though.
The one guy who doesn't make it no shit.

441
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,340
He still calls you guys up to hey you
think are good to spoke Doritos Dave and

442
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:31,760
you're breaking up.
I got to go.

443
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,210
I'm on the hill on the hill.
Did you?

444
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,680
Yeah,
but that's always funny cause I was out

445
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,800
of the,
there's always one,

446
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,240
the guys that I moved out here or the
guy when I lived with,

447
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,950
when I moved out here,
they're all doing good stuff,

448
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,240
not comics,
but they're all doing this stuff,

449
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:48,380
which is wild.
This is good.

450
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:50,880
If they're not that they weren't common
better.

451
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,650
It was easier for me cause I didn't
want,

452
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,750
yeah.
I also think competition in those places

453
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:56,490
gets kind of thick.
You know it could,

454
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,530
it depends.
Some guy gets on some guy,

455
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,730
you know as you watch one dude get a lot
of like rise and then everyone else is

456
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:04,530
like,
why the fuck is he getting so much?

457
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,730
Right.
It becomes this,

458
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:07,740
you know I lived with,
I've only lived with,

459
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:09,360
the only comic I've ever lived with was
Dunkin.

460
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,830
That was the only for like six months.

461
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,663
Love Him.
Must,

462
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,190
it might not even been six months,
somewhere in the neighborhood of six

463
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,540
months.
I never lived with a comic.

464
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:17,310
I think you got booted out of his house
though.

465
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,160
He was living with a gal and then they
had a little gut of a struggle and you

466
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,830
called me up from a motel and I'm like,
come on,

467
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,060
live with me man.
Fuck it.

468
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,760
Come on dude.
Party this big old house living by

469
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,590
myself.
Like let's have some fun.

470
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:32,760
And he actually used my isolation tank
to get over his breakup.

471
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,110
Really?
Yeah.

472
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,020
He gotten their tank every day.
He would smoke weed and get in the tank

473
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:41,640
and think about life and just let it
size and wrote a journal and then left

474
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,230
it behind.
So I've read every page of it.

475
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,760
Call them up.
I was like,

476
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:45,990
dude,
what is all this gay shit?

477
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,220
What is this?
What do you got here?

478
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,290
First couple of pages.
I love angel.

479
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,810
I want,
yeah,

480
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,990
you,
yeah.

481
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,950
You don't mind if I put it online,
right page for page.

482
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,690
I don't know where that is.
It might have got lost in one of my

483
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:59,550
moves.
I might just turn up somewhere.

484
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,110
I was going to say you should do a time
release.

485
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,120
Like every day a new page gets released
online.

486
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,130
It wasn't really that bad.
It was just him,

487
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,470
you know,
like getting out of the tank and just

488
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,170
sweat sortings head out.
What's the first thing you think of when

489
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,370
you get out of the tank?
Oh,

490
00:19:11,371 --> 00:19:13,710
it's very different every time.
I mean,

491
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,020
most of the time when I get an attack,
I'm just trying to chill out.

492
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,750
I've always had,
I always have so many plates spinning.

493
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,430
You know,
there's like so many different things.

494
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,440
I'm always thinking about like there's
podcasts.

495
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,460
Who's the future guests?
When am I doing stand up?

496
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:28,400
What,
what bit am I working on?

497
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:28,920
Right.
Let's go.

498
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,520
The UFC is coming up like,
Oh have I watched this guy fight before?

499
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:33,870
I got to make sure that I,
you know,

500
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:34,990
get my,
my,

501
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,810
my views in on different styles and
stuff and have my ideas about what I

502
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,970
think about these match ups.
And you don't sleep,

503
00:19:41,971 --> 00:19:43,230
you don't sleep.
I sleep.

504
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,210
You're sleeping there?
No in the tank.

505
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,460
Oh No,
no.

506
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,330
I don't sleep in there.
Can people save saving the tech?

507
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,680
Uh,
yes.

508
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:52,350
You definitely can.
I would imagine that your own snores.

509
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,290
Doe would echo off the walls a little
bit and maybe that will wake you up,

510
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,120
but I'm sure I've passed out in there
before.

511
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,730
I'm sure I have many years that I've
been doing it.

512
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,510
I first got one 16 years ago.
Holy Shit.

513
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,070
Yeah.
That's when I first got a tank.

514
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,370
I've got one in 2002 that's wild.
Yeah.

515
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,710
Do you do the cryo freeze too?
They do that too.

516
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,620
Yeah man.
I really prefer sauna.

517
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,050
It takes more time.
But,

518
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:18,300
uh,
I really like how Saunas make me feel.

519
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:22,140
But cryo gives you a for,
I shouldn't say I prefer it.

520
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,510
Here's the problem.
I have a sauna here,

521
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,740
so like I'm biased so I could just turn
it on and I'll do it way more often.

522
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,010
I have to drive to the cryo place.
Park my car.

523
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,620
That's a whole clothes off.
Climbing a cryo machine here.

524
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:34,881
No,
no,

525
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:35,940
no.
It's very complicated.

526
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:39,400
And you have to have a license and
you're carrying for nitrogen here.

527
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,490
Fuck Dude.
That's a cryo dude.

528
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,280
Jamie would like that.
You want to cry?

529
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:44,160
Oh Dude.
Hanging around.

530
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,550
I was thinking about that one girl that
died vegas cause she was doing it

531
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,960
without supervision.
We'll see.

532
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,270
How long was she in a four.
She did a different kind.

533
00:20:52,271 --> 00:20:55,600
See there's two different kinds.
There's the kind that uses liquid

534
00:20:55,601 --> 00:21:00,580
nitrogen and then you stand in this
liquid nitrogen and in that kind it's

535
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:03,910
only from the neck down.
So your head is not being frozen.

536
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,460
That's not as effective.
It's effective.

537
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,550
It definitely does something but it
doesn't do as much as the one where

538
00:21:09,551 --> 00:21:12,340
you're standing at 250 degree below zero
air.

539
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,620
That's the one that I go to.
That's Cryo healthcare.

540
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,690
They're in La on La Cienega and then
there are about five miles away from

541
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:21,700
here in woodland hills.
So you just getting like a chamber?

542
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,010
Yes.
Under wearing gloves.

543
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,180
Yes.
I got to where you were like crocs on

544
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:29,590
your feet,
something rubber on your feet,

545
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,330
like rubber clogs rather.

546
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,060
Um,
because you're,

547
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,340
you're going to wear socks,
socks go up to your ankles are up to

548
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:39,490
your calves rather like because your
skin can freeze.

549
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,040
Like you can get frostbite.
Like I know people that have been in

550
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,400
there too long and they've got a little
bit of burning sensation on their is too

551
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:47,950
long.
The most I've ever done is three minutes

552
00:21:47,951 --> 00:21:51,280
and 40 seconds.
They don't let you do more than I think

553
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:53,950
a minute and a half on your first one.
They want want to make sure that you

554
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:54,820
don't freak out,
you know,

555
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:57,880
too sensitive and then you build your
way up to three minutes is the Max.

556
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,360
The only reason why I went further than
that because there was a guy worked

557
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,610
there and we were just trying to figure
out what you can take.

558
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,860
Yeah,
I was going to save you.

559
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,040
You did it because you want it to.

560
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,660
I wanted to see if I have court I could
take,

561
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:10,300
did you do it?
I've done twice.

562
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,510
I think vent,
two minutes Max.

563
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:14,140
This for me,
I felt like at full I felt like it.

564
00:22:14,141 --> 00:22:16,060
Four minutes,
I would have had real problems.

565
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,400
I was like,
I was on the door of real problems at

566
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:20,230
three minutes and 40 seconds your brain
start.

567
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:21,011
Do you feel stuff?
We'd like,

568
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:23,800
does your head start getting fucked up?
It's hard to concentrate.

569
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,070
It's hard to stay cool like the whole,
the whole deal is just like,

570
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:28,350
stay chill,
cool.

571
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,940
Kill your you to keep it together.
You don't want to freak out.

572
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:37,110
But then my legs started involuntary
bucking.

573
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,660
They were doing this.
That's your body saying this.

574
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,740
This isn't,
we got to,

575
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,860
it was not.
It was like,

576
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:46,210
okay,
so my rational brain was still like 30%

577
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:47,470
operational.
Maybe at that point,

578
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,270
maybe 40% you're like,
you know,

579
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,670
thinking that you couldn't do math
problems,

580
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,504
you're not thinking clearly.

581
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,200
You could do math problems for the first
30 seconds and then you'd be like,

582
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:58,120
holy fuck,
holy fuck.

583
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:01,480
What if you just thought about one math
problem over and over in your brain and

584
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:05,910
circulated that shit until the end and
you'd be focused on it so hard then.

585
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,690
Then when you started to forget how to
do it,

586
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,460
then you know you're out and you can't
do it anymore.

587
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,150
Well one thing I do do is I do that Wim
Hof breathing method or I take these

588
00:23:13,151 --> 00:23:18,151
gigantic breaths and then I let out 20%
and then I take another breath like as

589
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:21,670
deep as I can get my lines,
let out 20% and I concentrate on doing

590
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:23,680
that and time flies by.
That's what they do.

591
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,300
That's what those deep divers to write
those guys,

592
00:23:25,301 --> 00:23:26,110
they go to those,
uh,

593
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,100
don't they do that?
Did they?

594
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,510
Cause they learn how to store breath.

595
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,580
I don't know what they do.
We were seeing those videos with those

596
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:31,370
guys.
They dive like,

597
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,580
you know,
and those dive tanks that they have set

598
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:34,301
up,
but the way they do it,

599
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:36,560
it looks like they in tons of breath,
they let a little bit,

600
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:39,220
they keep taking it in and sit there
like just storing it in there and you

601
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:39,851
know,
in the sax,

602
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,710
in their lungs.
I would think that that's not just

603
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,350
storing oxygen to that you'd be storing
carbon dioxide.

604
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:45,560
Right?
Cause you're not breathing out.

605
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.
But they'd breathe out a little bit at a

606
00:23:47,001 --> 00:23:47,840
time.
Hello,

607
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:50,150
fuck.
Do you convert oxygen to carbon dioxide?

608
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,120
I've always just,
just uh,

609
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,580
accepted that I never thought of about
the fact that air goes in.

610
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:58,910
Why isn't air going out without fuck is
happening and it's only going right

611
00:23:58,911 --> 00:24:00,740
there.
Like how's it turned into carbon

612
00:24:00,741 --> 00:24:01,220
dioxide?

613
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,410
A little dude.
It's just going in there and then it

614
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:03,801
comes,
right?

615
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,770
Like that's it.
I converted.

616
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,360
Yeah.
Right now that's ridiculous.

617
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,670
Mushy or conversion machine.
That's what we all are.

618
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,460
Big Conversion,
carbon dioxide conversion machines.

619
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,660
You learn that kind of stuff.
Like of,

620
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,290
of how quickly things happen when like,
like my college roommate had gout.

621
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,170
You know what I mean?
We're like blood turns around front jeff

622
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:22,070
at that.
That's crazy.

623
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:23,960
So like it's your,
it's like your fingers or your hand.

624
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,490
Anything we're blood has like a long
feet.

625
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,021
Yeah.
Fee.

626
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:28,760
It's usually legs and feet.
And I never understood until I looked it

627
00:24:28,761 --> 00:24:30,950
up when he had it and I was like,
how do you get gout?

628
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,160
And everything online is like 50 plus is
at risk.

629
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:36,430
You know like high blood pressure.
Go to music.

630
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,480
It was 20 years old.
Jesus shouldn't had it.

631
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,010
You know they call it King's disease.

632
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,840
Yeah.
Cause they were fat and ate and drank

633
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,040
all day.
Just drink wine,

634
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,880
their feet,
you know,

635
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,820
fucking awesome.
That is.

636
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:49,580
Especially when everybody else is
starving.

637
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,410
If you'd be like,
please sir,

638
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,010
let me rest my swollen dead feed on your
head.

639
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,030
I've been watching biking's I get into
that show vikings.

640
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,710
I mean I've never seen him pretty God
damn good.

641
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:02,360
She's good.
I was super skeptical.

642
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,860
People telling me it was good.
I was like,

643
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:05,510
it's unregular TV.
How the fuck could it be?

644
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:07,280
And he was on,
it was on history channel.

645
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,810
Oh yeah.
Which is another one.

646
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,670
It's on history channel,
but it's a,

647
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,670
but it's a drama.
How the fuck it's based on historical

648
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:15,230
facts apparently.
Right.

649
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,530
Ragnar Ragnar Loft Brooke,
that's his name,

650
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,890
but it's fucking Badass show.
But one of the thing that's crazy about

651
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:23,000
the shows,
he really stopped thinking,

652
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,470
well this is really how it worked.

653
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,900
Like how king's treated regular people.
Totally.

654
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,350
They really got away with that and all
they were was just a regular guy.

655
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,310
I didn't have super powers.
No,

656
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:33,980
they didn't.
And everybody would just bow down to

657
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,080
him,
sire and they would kiss the rings and

658
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,180
they would just let them do whatever the
fuck they wanted.

659
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,220
It's so weird.
Fear of death,

660
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:42,680
dude.
It's crazy that even the army would

661
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:45,460
listen to this guy like that.
Anybody would let it and it catches guys

662
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,270
weird or that the army listened to one
dude.

663
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,610
Occasionally they will go fuck you,
and they'd killed the guy and then a new

664
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:51,590
guy would rise.
That's what we should be doing.

665
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,030
We should do all that shit.
Now,

666
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,760
today,
did you see the video of trump talking

667
00:25:55,761 --> 00:25:57,400
about taxes?
Uh,

668
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,580
to what he said,
fuck,

669
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,140
I can check it out.
I'm going to charge you 25 be sent to

670
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,103
grow my instagram.

671
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,720
I sent it out yesterday.
Fucking amazing that that's the price.

672
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,460
There's two parts of me,
man.

673
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,080
There's one part of me that loves this.
Oh Dude,

674
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:16,450
I love it.
One part of me that's god Ha Craig

675
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,310
material.
There's so many fakes and phoneys and

676
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,850
ridiculous career politicians that have
to watch this guy.

677
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,331
Yeah.
Say,

678
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,970
listen motherfuckers,
you're going to pay 25% taxes and

679
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,660
everybody goes crazy.
Tears.

680
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,570
Yeah.
Cause like they can't believe he's

681
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,490
really saying it,
but it's the stuff that they would say

682
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:34,430
to if they didn't have any reservations.
Well it's maybe,

683
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,320
but I think a lot of those guys are just
like that.

684
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:41,350
Let's play it because it's hilarious.
I'm dropping

685
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
25% tax on gene Jana.
And I said to somebody that is really

686
00:26:51,391 --> 00:26:54,030
the Messenger.
The Messenger is important.

687
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,270
I could have one man say we're going to
tax you 25% and I can say another.

688
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,930
Listen,
your mother fuckers,

689
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:08,820
man,
I'm telling you,

690
00:27:08,821 --> 00:27:09,820
man,
look

691
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,070
not in favor of the wall.
I'm pro immigration.

692
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,310
I'm not a favor of these ice busts and
all that jazz,

693
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,860
but shit like that one's me over.
I said,

694
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,430
well,
I just love the fact that the guy's the

695
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:25,410
fucking president.
And he said,

696
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:26,580
listen,
you motherfuckers,

697
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,730
you got to pay 25% taxes.
It says eight years before the campaign.

698
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,870
It doesn't say how many years.
Oh,

699
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,630
I love,
and I forgot.

700
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,210
Oh,
is it?

701
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:35,400
Is it 2011 it's old.
He looks the sense,

702
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,050
but what's,
you know what's so funny?

703
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,420
I was talking about on a stage,
it's still ridiculous.

704
00:27:39,421 --> 00:27:42,450
I'm so tired of being yelled at by like
online about people hate him.

705
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:42,930
Like,
listen,

706
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,510
I'm not a huge fan of them either,
but so many people are like,

707
00:27:45,511 --> 00:27:46,141
I hate him.
I hate him.

708
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:47,940
I hate him that now.
I kind of liked him.

709
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,510
Exactly like,
do you know how enough people say Shit?

710
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,390
They're like,
fuck you.

711
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm so tired of you telling me your
opinion.

712
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,640
It's all the same to do.
Also what annoys me is when someone goes

713
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,040
fucking moron,
that's like,

714
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,910
that's it.
That's all.

715
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,900
That's what you did.
You,

716
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:01,321
you,
you,

717
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:03,570
you put like,
that's not doing anything by going,

718
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,360
hey,
trump shuck my dick.

719
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:06,360
It's all right,
dude.

720
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:06,991
Well,
you got 'em.

721
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:09,270
Here's my take on that.
If it's that,

722
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:11,280
if it's fucking moron,
you're not even supposed to listen.

723
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,010
That's supposed to not even go in.
I know because there's not a,

724
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,100
this is not effective communication,
so if you engage that guy,

725
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,440
don't I just completely waste your time.
Even if you get upset at you completely

726
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,920
waste your time.
I wipe it away,

727
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,000
but I see it and I'm like,
oh,

728
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,310
come on.
This is the one that gets me as Nazi

729
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,630
fucking Nazi Nazi.

730
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,240
Oh yeah,
he's a Nazi and you're a Nazi fascist.

731
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,820
They throw these words around.
They really don't even know what the

732
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:35,080
fuck they're saying.
Like if you really think that everybody

733
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,800
looks likes trump is a Nazi,
you're missing.

734
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:40,230
That's insane.
You're missing a giant point.

735
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,820
You're,
you're fucking up everything.

736
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,970
You're ruining this conversation.
You're right about a lot of the shitty

737
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:47,370
does wrong here,
but as soon as you say he's a Nazi,

738
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,980
right,
and that there's Nazi,

739
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,420
everyone's a Nazi.
Well then when real Nazis come around,

740
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:52,680
you've get better.
Have a better name.

741
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

742
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:57,990
You can't with the court call Nazis,
you can't fucking take the word Nazi and

743
00:28:57,991 --> 00:28:59,580
apply it to shit.
That's not Nazis.

744
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:01,500
That's dangerous.
Like that's a sale.

745
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,220
Like call someone a murderer.
Why'd you call him a murderer?

746
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,990
Because he yelled and insult at that
man,

747
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,640
okay,
that's not a murderer.

748
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,860
Right?
Like you can't do that same thing.

749
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,640
We call someone a Nazi.
That's not a nonsense.

750
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:15,360
He might be a moron.
He might be a fool.

751
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,990
He might be a into trump just because
he's a dumb guy and he likes the fact

752
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,720
there's a white guy in office.
But that doesn't mean he's a Nazi.

753
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,380
But it's also like the,
the biggest problem that I have is like

754
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,990
you're,
it's still illegal to be an asshole.

755
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,060
It's not illegal to be a dick.
Right.

756
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,380
If someone's,
if someone says something you don't

757
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,130
like,
right.

758
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,510
It's not against the law.
Right.

759
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,360
So like this idea of you tagging someone
like that,

760
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:37,320
the biggest criminal in the world
because they said something you don't

761
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:39,000
like.
It's crazy to me like,

762
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,320
well,
people are allowed to not fucking think

763
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,220
what you think is right.

764
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,210
Right Brian?

765
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,810
They're trying to redefine what's
acceptable by calling words violence.

766
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:51,070
Like they're calling saying hang speech.
Hate speech is real.

767
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,911
Right.
I don't know though.

768
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:52,420
See,
it's fun.

769
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,231
Little Fun.
It's real.

770
00:29:53,231 --> 00:29:55,150
If you say something like,
fuck the Jews,

771
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,070
I hate all Jews.
Jews should die.

772
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,120
That's hate speech.

773
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,610
Okay.
It's to me it's this.

774
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,780
If you set,
if a guy said,

775
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:04,030
fuck the Jews,
I disagree with what he says.

776
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,290
Well you should say,
how do you fuck them?

777
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,470
Fuck them.
Genuine the front and about.

778
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:09,790
Fuck Dude,
go go around the world.

779
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,040
What he did kvetch after.
No,

780
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,200
but I think it's like Wah,
Wah,

781
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:13,150
Wah,
but listen,

782
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,070
that person,
that person,

783
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,430
what hate speech to me is like a,
it's just a big,

784
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:20,920
huge term that can encompass so many
things.

785
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,690
I don't really know what it is,
right?

786
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,400
It does.
It incite violence.

787
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,280
The devices,
the Jews does that inside violence.

788
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:28,720
It shouldn't.
No,

789
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:30,580
that's just that.
If I said fuck your shirt,

790
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,080
it only inside the fund you to terrorist
shirt

791
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,610
close as soon as you,
the way you said shirt,

792
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,780
I was like,
yeah,

793
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,140
leading a shirt revolution you have
fuck,

794
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,860
shut your fucking shirt off too.
Fucking short broke.

795
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,070
Certainly Bro,
you surely way fuck the Jews works is if

796
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:51,210
someone also thinks fuck the Jews and
then you like find likeminded shitheads

797
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,590
but that's going to happen no matter
what.

798
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,840
But it's not going to have,
if you don't say it then.

799
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,580
So the idea is like,
can you suppress it?

800
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,590
Here's the problem with stopping hate
speech is like who's to decide because

801
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:04,140
they're pushing the boundary of what?
Hate speech so far.

802
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,630
Right?
Like if you call a trans woman,

803
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,840
a man that's hate speech like that,
there's,

804
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,000
it's kind what did,
that's just an accident.

805
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,700
Yeah,
it's still accidental hate speech.

806
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,780
Why?
That's crazy.

807
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:17,580
Because we live in a new world now.
See,

808
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:19,380
I can't accept that you don't go online
and now

809
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,130
if you do it out of malice,
like if you're,

810
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,120
if someone's like,
Hey,

811
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:25,850
I'm Margaret and a guy goes,
no,

812
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,010
no,
I'm not going to call you that good

813
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,820
there I that then that's them being
proactively prejudice,

814
00:31:31,821 --> 00:31:33,380
right?
Them being a dick,

815
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,250
they're being an asshole.

816
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,390
But some people are of the opinion that
this is all nonsense.

817
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,400
But if it's an,
I'm not taking,

818
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,680
taking their point.
But I do want to play devil's advocate

819
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,350
because I've had conversations with
people who are pretty intelligent people

820
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,540
than to say,
this is all nonsense.

821
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,970
And then this trans stuff,
and this is,

822
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:52,170
this is a trendy thing that people were
really getting into in summary Bore

823
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,240
really distorted.
Their perceptions of reality is really

824
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:58,750
distorted and they're being talked into
this because it's a thing that a lot of

825
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,100
people are doing it.
And so they're getting,

826
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,960
and um,
I hear that and I go,

827
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,300
wow,
I don't know if I believe that people

828
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:07,960
are willing to transition to another sex
because they're confused.

829
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,360
That's a big leap.
It's a giant ass leap.

830
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:14,950
But here's the other leap.
The leap is you telling someone whether

831
00:32:14,951 --> 00:32:18,130
or not they feel a certain way.
And then the other leap,

832
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,290
here's the other leap.
What do you give a fuck if Bruce Jenner

833
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,250
wants to become Caitlyn Jenner,
I'll call our Kaitlin.

834
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,230
I don't care.
But if she thinks I'm gonna stop making

835
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:27,920
fun of her,
she's out of her fucking mind.

836
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,130
That's what it,
but that's what I mean.

837
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:32,160
So you should be allowed to just,
you should be allowed to mock at a

838
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:33,690
freedom that you would anyway.

839
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,900
Every six foot,
three person would size 14 high heels

840
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,730
gets mocked.
Just listen around clock because

841
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,160
anybody would get made fun of for any of
that in any other way.

842
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,890
Yes.
If you used to be a girl or you used to

843
00:32:45,891 --> 00:32:48,200
be a dude,
and now you're a girl and someone's

844
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,810
gonna make fun of you,
and that's just the price you pay for

845
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:52,640
being a person.
But people make fun of everyone for

846
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:53,660
everything.
Everything.

847
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:54,590
You have red hair,
right?

848
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,000
Is My whole life,
your whole life.

849
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:58,250
But what?
I can't start a group against it being

850
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:00,190
like people trying enough of this
enough.

851
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,760
No,
just it is what it is.

852
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:04,520
Everyone has these flaws.
The kick of Ginger Ginger Day.

853
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,950
That wasn't cool.
No,

854
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,520
but no,
but you know what's so funny about that?

855
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:10,850
Those guys were so subversive.
What they're doing is showing how

856
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,160
quickly people jump onto things and go,
yeah,

857
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:14,690
fuck them.
Fuck them all.

858
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,630
So they're so smart.
I love that episode because it was like

859
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:20,420
that could be a real,
and that's how dumb people are.

860
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,480
People in the real world have told me,
I've been through it.

861
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,220
I wonder when we kick of Ginger Day is
they buy that's real to them.

862
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,030
But that's,
that's by the way I played,

863
00:33:28,031 --> 00:33:29,750
uh,
I played golf with a buddy at the

864
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,530
country club that,
uh,

865
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,600
Caitlyn Jenner belongs to.
My first question does,

866
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,620
does she hit from the women's season,
the men's tees and the guy with me goes,

867
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,120
she hits from the women's taste.
I'm like,

868
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,130
Bull Shit.
See,

869
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,670
that's bullshit.
Is it bullshit?

870
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:44,881
Because you,
you,

871
00:33:44,881 --> 00:33:46,220
you're a fucking Olympian.
You,

872
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,240
you were,
you still the difference between teasing

873
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,900
the men's tees?
I mean like distance 30,

874
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:51,734
40 yards.
Yeah.

875
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,910
Ah,
yeah.

876
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,370
That's like doing those pushups on your
knees.

877
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,390
Bullshit.
Yeah.

878
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,250
Good on your toes.
But,

879
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:57,980
but,
but wait a minute.

880
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,850
He used,
uh,

881
00:33:58,851 --> 00:34:00,020
she was,
she had,

882
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,290
she has man structured muscle and then
go away.

883
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:04,250
That's all gone.

884
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,680
No Way.
Muscle.

885
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,570
There's no muscle while she's still
pretty fucking jam.

886
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,530
Not Really,
man.

887
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:11,420
I said no,
I'm going to be honest.

888
00:34:11,421 --> 00:34:15,200
I don't think she works out at all.
And she's old already,

889
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:17,930
so it's not like your body has,
I still say you go back to her,

890
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,760
but she still has a Dick,
right?

891
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,170
Nope.
She had the operation.

892
00:34:21,171 --> 00:34:22,110
Cut it off.
It's hot.

893
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,130
Is it gone now?
You're okay now you get women's tees

894
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,710
up.
Dick was there.

895
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:29,450
You gotta go.
You gotta go back to the black.

896
00:34:29,451 --> 00:34:30,950
Yeah.
There's a lot of fence riders out there

897
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:32,930
in the Trans World.
Pick it.

898
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,360
You gotta pick dude,
you gotta come,

899
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,380
you gotta come or go.
That's another thing they're saying,

900
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,030
this is this,
I don't agree with this,

901
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:42,500
is they're saying that if you are a
person who is male and likes women,

902
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,620
if you are unwilling to date a trans
woman,

903
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,190
it's because you are a transphobic
bigot,

904
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,460
including if that Trans Woman's still
has a penis.

905
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,650
That is,
that's of no regard.

906
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,010
You know the funny thing of the,
of all this is I'm so happy to just be a

907
00:34:58,011 --> 00:34:59,990
CIS gender men,
like a fucking,

908
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,080
I'm so happy to not have to worry about
it.

909
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,510
I don't have to worry about it.
No one's going to call me a bigot for

910
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:09,050
not liking a subset of a kind of a thing
that I like.

911
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,790
I just like a whoa.
I like women.

912
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:11,511
That's all I know.
I like,

913
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:12,344
that's it.
I'm fine.

914
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,740
They'll come around to you soon.
Take [inaudible].

915
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,910
They got Bruno Mars.
He didn't see it coming home on that was

916
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:18,680
said.
What did they say?

917
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,530
Appropriating black culture.
Cultural appropriation.

918
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,910
You see how many people came to his
rescue though?

919
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:24,050
A bunch of people were like,
that's bullshit.

920
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,130
He's a musician.
He,

921
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,450
what has he done that was he
appropriating black culture made zinging

922
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:29,840
awesome.

923
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,060
Made good music.
Yeah.

924
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,680
That's all he did that billionaire
songs,

925
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,210
a wonderful song and he made some
fucking great songs.

926
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,860
Artists.
It's bullshit to think people now can

927
00:35:37,861 --> 00:35:40,980
stab at anything that you're like now
you're just trying to cause a stir.

928
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,050
They try it.
They take swings and sometimes don't

929
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:44,100
work.
Like remember when they were trying to

930
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:47,490
block bossy?
It's like fuck off.

931
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,310
Like okay,
just put it out.

932
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,890
Just want to put it out out there.
Trying to put it out and just giving it

933
00:35:53,891 --> 00:35:54,481
a shot.
Yeah.

934
00:35:54,481 --> 00:35:56,640
Bruno Mars,
they shut us down so fast and he didn't

935
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:58,010
say anything back.
Good for him.

936
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,940
That's my favorite shit.
It's kind of like,

937
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,580
you know how like Samsung and all these
other phone companies,

938
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,160
they make ads about iphones,
you know other,

939
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,080
all their ads are based on fuck I
iphones.

940
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,960
Apple never makes a response.
Of course.

941
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,060
That's the coolest movies to be like
whatever man.

942
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,550
Yeah,
that Samsung ad is stupid.

943
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:17,100
That's when they walk past.
The people waiting in line for an

944
00:36:17,101 --> 00:36:17,701
office.
Had those.

945
00:36:17,701 --> 00:36:19,260
Samsung always been like,
hey,

946
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:19,891
hey,
hey,

947
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:20,221
hey,
hey.

948
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,840
It's like the annoying little brother
and you're like,

949
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,340
oh dude,
get the fuck outta here.

950
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,420
We're just do your own thing.
They make the best second best phones,

951
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,170
set gear,
the second best phone in the world and

952
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:32,580
make the best second best facet.
You're number one at making the number

953
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:36,150
two phones sort of the Google phone is
probably better.

954
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,570
I think the Samsung probably sells.
What do you,

955
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,740
what about this ad as that was the Imac?
I'm a Mac.

956
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:42,420
I'm a PC.
I'm a Mac.

957
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:44,070
I'm a PC.
Yeah,

958
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,650
those were so dumb.
But those are in the nineties man.

959
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,270
Yes,
those what I'm saying?

960
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:51,570
I'm saying currently they don't run any
ads like that guy from drag me to hell,

961
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:51,950
right?

962
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,160
No.
What was the movie?

963
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:55,860
He was Justin Long.
What was that movie he was in?

964
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,590
He was in a great fucking harm movie.
Like a real classic.

965
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:02,410
Can't be harmed movie Kevin Smith's one.
No,

966
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:02,851
no,
no,

967
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:03,780
no.
He was in Tusk.

968
00:37:03,781 --> 00:37:05,400
Right,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

969
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:08,790
There was one that he was in put up,
pull back it up with that.

970
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,741
Right though.
That is funny.

971
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:13,830
I forgot about those ads.
That's how long ago that way using

972
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:17,640
windows to write lately I use windows 10
it's fucking great.

973
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:22,380
There's nothing wrong with it.
Like windows 10 is in my opinion,

974
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,650
just as good narrowed.
Pretty boy.

975
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,420
Oh,
they're arguing with each other.

976
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,350
Mac versus pc.
Windows 10 is just as good as,

977
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,390
uh,
as Mac in terms of like,

978
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,850
it's a little different but it doesn't
crash.

979
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,590
I don't know.
I'm not having any problems with it.

980
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,510
It works great,
but I'm not even going to lie.

981
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:40,440
I'm not gonna be one these people,
you know,

982
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:41,190
like,
like,

983
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,710
like,
like james is a fucking tech genius.

984
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,660
He knows wizard.
Yeah,

985
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,770
he's a genius.
I when someone,

986
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,510
when someone says the accused of like,
why do you have a Mac?

987
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:49,940
And someone goes,
well judy,

988
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:51,450
it's great for the arts and it does this
and this.

989
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,650
I don't even lie.
I go,

990
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:55,280
dude,
I just pull up jeepers creepers in that.

991
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,440
But there was another one.
It was him that was a good one.

992
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,300
That was a good one.
Fuck you

993
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,070
guys.
The Guy who drove the old truck,

994
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,280
the mean deviled guy with the wings that
drove the old truck loved it.

995
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,920
It probably made 18 bucks.
It was probably,

996
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,540
she has 18 bucks.
The other movie through.

997
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,190
You're thinking of die hard,
but no,

998
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:13,950
no,
no.

999
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,050
He was in,
um,

1000
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,380
see,
go to his,

1001
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,970
uh,
you know that you don't have no,

1002
00:38:18,971 --> 00:38:21,150
it's good that he does.
The restaurant movie was pretty funny

1003
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,770
too.
I am going to be,

1004
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,890
he was definitely in a horror movie like
recently.

1005
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,371
No,
no,

1006
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,530
no.
Just go to the stop looking at images.

1007
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:31,830
You're like a little kid,
but you're fucking instagram can't,

1008
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:34,850
you can't look at like real words.
Where's the picture of the movie?

1009
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:36,100
He was,
what is that right

1010
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,560
there in there?
What's that?

1011
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:39,251
Trump.
What does that say?

1012
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:41,410
Track.
Confusing him with somebody else.

1013
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,273
Yeah.
You gotta be,

1014
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,310
there was like a some hell movie where
like,

1015
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:46,870
he,
he had to go to hell.

1016
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,200
She'll drag me to hell or something like
that.

1017
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,230
I feel like drag me to hell is a,
uh,

1018
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,800
a movie about a chick that was like
murder to came back to life.

1019
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,760
Yeah.
That's a great,

1020
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,260
that's the story.
That's a great story.

1021
00:38:59,261 --> 00:39:01,300
I think that's what it was.
I never saw it in that though.

1022
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,470
He's the boyfriend.
He is.

1023
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:05,550
He's in that one too.
When you're talking time.

1024
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:06,330
Okay.

1025
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:06,950
No,
no.

1026
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:09,500
It was just a year ago.
Let me see what it looks like.

1027
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,270
Okay.

1028
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,680
Okay.
That is it.

1029
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,170
That is it.
Yeah.

1030
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,510
What the fuck?
I never saw that.

1031
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,080
That's that is it.
It's um,

1032
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,100
it was like,
uh,

1033
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,330
uh,
which,

1034
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,260
yup.
That's it.

1035
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,150
Clay,
Clay Dalton.

1036
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,660
There was another movie that sounded
like drag me to hell.

1037
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,250
What does that,
is that guy shoving his fist in her

1038
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:31,510
throat?
I was a good movie.

1039
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,150
That was a good,
stupid movie that drag me to hell movie.

1040
00:39:34,151 --> 00:39:35,650
That is what the name of it was.
I was right.

1041
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,150
I was right.
But I was confused.

1042
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,210
There's one with a woman,
like there's a woman on the cover.

1043
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,700
It looks like she's like a silhouette
and she's screaming.

1044
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,610
It's something about drag maybe dragged
you to hell.

1045
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,340
Yeah.

1046
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,260
Is that what it is?
Drag me to hell.

1047
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,380
It's another one.
Same month.

1048
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,630
Same movie.
It's a movie.

1049
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah,
but that's not it.

1050
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,750
You just named that you were like the
woman's screaming.

1051
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,820
I did.
I did,

1052
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,530
but that's not the,
that's not the same cover.

1053
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,990
Perfect.
Easily issue houses in the back.

1054
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,760
That's hard.
That's not it.

1055
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,410
No.
There was another one.

1056
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,810
I might,
I might have the name completely wrong

1057
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:07,790
for the movie,
but it was about a woman.

1058
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,490
See this is hard because I didn't
actually watch it,

1059
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,940
but it was about a woman who got killed
and she came back and got the people got

1060
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:15,480
her,
I don't know,

1061
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:17,120
like high plains drifter.
You remember that?

1062
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:17,870
Yeah.

1063
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,130
Clint Eastwood.
Oh yes.

1064
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:19,964
He was killed.
Yeah.

1065
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,370
Came back to life and fucked everybody
up in the town.

1066
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,263
Yeah.
That's good.

1067
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,980
Western harm.
Western horror.

1068
00:40:24,981 --> 00:40:26,780
Right,
but a sneaky western harm movie.

1069
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,790
Like you don't really exactly know
what's going on.

1070
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:30,290
Where's,
there's not a western horror anymore.

1071
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,840
Do they do shit like that was the last
western horror.

1072
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:37,220
He said there was a western Ufo movie.
Cowboys and aliens.

1073
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,420
Remember that?
Yeah,

1074
00:40:38,421 --> 00:40:40,010
but that's a piece of shit,
I guess.

1075
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:41,990
You know what you could call now,
like you could do western,

1076
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,780
like no country for old men.
Could be like a western.

1077
00:40:44,781 --> 00:40:46,460
That was a horror movie.
That guy was a monster.

1078
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,600
Yeah.
I don't know.

1079
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,730
A tour or if it's like more like a
terror.

1080
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,451
Terror.
Yeah,

1081
00:40:50,451 --> 00:40:52,580
like a terror.
And that guy was a monster.

1082
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,920
I mean,
might as well be fucking awesome.

1083
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,390
How good is that fucking actor?

1084
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,040
What does that gentleman's name with the
crazy hair?

1085
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,720
Uh,
the mop on his head.

1086
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:01,670
Come on.
What's wrong with me?

1087
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,360
Sorry.
What movie?

1088
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,070
No country for old men.
Uh,

1089
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,610
Javier Bardem.
Yeah,

1090
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,400
he's so good.
He's a beast.

1091
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,910
Like you really believe that guy with
murder,

1092
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:09,411
but you go,
well,

1093
00:41:09,411 --> 00:41:11,300
you know when you look in some actor's
eyes and you're like,

1094
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,260
ah,
something real.

1095
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,970
So inside of that he has that thing
where you're like,

1096
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,170
oh fuck.
You know,

1097
00:41:15,171 --> 00:41:16,460
some actors just are like,
oh,

1098
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:18,050
they're just playing a character.
Yeah.

1099
00:41:18,051 --> 00:41:19,820
When they don't have it,
it drives me nuts.

1100
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,340
Now.
I know that guy looking at shit.

1101
00:41:22,341 --> 00:41:24,210
Look at us.
Look at his eyes.

1102
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,540
Zoom in on his eyes.
Chan movie.

1103
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:28,520
Is this from,
is that a new movie?

1104
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,020
Loving Pablo?
I don't know.

1105
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,460
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

1106
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,560
He looks exactly like him.
He did it again.

1107
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,460
A bunch of weight for that.

1108
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,560
He's always been kind of a thick dude
though.

1109
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,820
But look at the picture of him above on
the blue shirt right above that and for

1110
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,630
sure he's kind of a thick dude.
Nah,

1111
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,970
not like Pablo.
Picture that public picture looks.

1112
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:45,110
He's about 70 pounds.
Ever.

1113
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:47,360
Look at that.
Look at a fucked up was psycho.

1114
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,630
He was a good psycho.
That moves a fucked up movie cause it

1115
00:41:50,631 --> 00:41:51,770
just ends.
Yeah.

1116
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:53,250
That's why the country for old men like
what?

1117
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,460
Sometimes bad guys get away.
Fuck off.

1118
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,860
Won't Coen brothers.
It was coen brothers,

1119
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:59,390
wasn't it?
He was Frankenstein,

1120
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,470
Frankenstein,
Frankenstein,

1121
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,570
all the new monster movies.
He's got bleached blonde hair.

1122
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,250
It's gay Frankenstein.
That's what happens.

1123
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,570
The guy dies on the operating table
getting his cheeks done.

1124
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:16,100
Gay freaking inside
was that.

1125
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:18,450
He's taking it back to suck your deck.

1126
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:24,000
Go to the picture above that cheese.
Get to to Dickson his neck.

1127
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,570
A set of bolts,
the Tan suit above it right there at Tan

1128
00:42:26,571 --> 00:42:27,440
suit right there.
Yeah,

1129
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,450
look at that.
God does the gay Frankenstein.

1130
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:32,870
Yeah.
Is he a but it's selling you a house.

1131
00:42:32,871 --> 00:42:34,610
I'll kill you.
Always a bond villain.

1132
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,540
That's right.
He was a bar.

1133
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,880
That dead dude's a beast.
But the problem with a guy like that is

1134
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:46,150
every movie that he does that's goofy,
takes away from degrading way you see

1135
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:49,070
him.
If you see him in a movie like this,

1136
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,060
right?
Like every movie,

1137
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,500
no country for old men is so 100% legit.
That if he does a bond movie and he's in

1138
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:00,760
some stupid karate scene where he's got
to like throw sidekicks,

1139
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,860
the guy kicks him in the balls and he
bends over and the guy or caught

1140
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,960
something,
it looks corniest shit it takes,

1141
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,970
but there's like only so many actors
that got away like Daniel Day Lewis.

1142
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:11,310
He's like the only dude that only did
shit he wanted to do.

1143
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,590
Almost everybody else does things where
you're like,

1144
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,270
why did you do that?
Right?

1145
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,010
I mean they all like,
they all have to,

1146
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,560
we'll nobody fucked it harder than
Dinero.

1147
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,030
Dinero dude did some of the greatest
movies of all time and possibly the

1148
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,790
worst movies in history.
It's done toilet water.

1149
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,910
Just mostly toilet water ever since.
Did you see,

1150
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,310
did,
did the output Chino paternal thing come

1151
00:43:32,311 --> 00:43:33,720
out yet?
When does that come up?

1152
00:43:33,721 --> 00:43:35,610
Have you seen that pregame?
Yes.

1153
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:38,010
Dude,
look at the picture.

1154
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,830
He looks identical.
I mean it's fucking creepy.

1155
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,090
One next month,
next week show the Joe Paterno knew

1156
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:47,400
those kids are getting molested.
Come on dude.

1157
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:48,450
Of course.
Of course.

1158
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:51,080
He looking at,
he looks at it and looking identical and

1159
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,160
everybody knew the guy was a pervert.

1160
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,790
He was running a fucking children's
charity where he's taking care of kids.

1161
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,830
I don't want to sound like one of those
guys,

1162
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:01,560
but I don't give a shit.
I remember when he got caught,

1163
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:02,060
when it,
when it,

1164
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,650
when it came out,
I said to a bunch of people,

1165
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:07,480
he's going to die soon.
Within like a month he'll die per sure.

1166
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:09,210
And sure enough,
he died shortly thereafter.

1167
00:44:09,211 --> 00:44:09,691
This whole thing.
Yeah.

1168
00:44:09,691 --> 00:44:11,910
Cause I knew it was going to kill him.
Oh God.

1169
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:15,600
That Sandusky thing.
So in this scene right here and the

1170
00:44:15,601 --> 00:44:17,370
trailer,
he's saying his wife is like,

1171
00:44:17,371 --> 00:44:18,330
his wife goes,
uh,

1172
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:19,261
well,
you know,

1173
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:21,210
he was,
he was with so and so.

1174
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,390
Their kids' names and he goes,
he was with [inaudible] like his own

1175
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:26,310
kids.
And then it hits him that he's like,

1176
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,610
he was watching them.
So then it hits him like May,

1177
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,940
Oh fuck he,
oh

1178
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,210
jb.
Fuck my kids.

1179
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,540
It's insane.
What the fuck man,

1180
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,130
that wasn't that long ago.
No,

1181
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:40,890
when was that?
That Sandusky arrest?

1182
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:43,040
12,
2012.

1183
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:46,230
So you should probably third 2013 easy
thing is they've already gotten rid of

1184
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,230
all their sanctions and whatnot.
Penn state's already back all their

1185
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:53,430
penalties and whatnot.
I'll tell you what the real quick money

1186
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:57,150
baby will crazy thing is the original
investigator and to Sandusky turned up,

1187
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:58,830
murdered his,
uh,

1188
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,820
they found his laptop with a like a
destroyed hard drive.

1189
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,640
And uh,
I think they never found his body.

1190
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,740
I think he,
I think he fucking vanished.

1191
00:45:07,741 --> 00:45:10,050
Trial was in 2012.
2012.

1192
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,100
Okay.
So that was a trial.

1193
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:16,101
So he's arrested in 2011 find the guy
who was the original investigator who

1194
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,600
turned out missing,
either turned up missing or murdered and

1195
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:23,700
his laptop,
uh,

1196
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:28,380
was found with a destroyed hard drive.
Like someone clearly got ahold of this

1197
00:45:28,381 --> 00:45:33,381
guy that he be fucking iced him because
he was going to destroy penn state.

1198
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,120
I mean,
he was going to take down this tie

1199
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,410
billion dollar industry.
What happened to your car?

1200
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:41,580
Wow.
Um,

1201
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:45,030
see what you get the story scroll,
make it larger there so I could read it

1202
00:45:45,031 --> 00:45:47,010
with my old eyes.
10 years ago,

1203
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:50,280
prosecutor in Center County,
Pennsylvania took the day off work and

1204
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,120
vanish.
Since then,

1205
00:45:51,121 --> 00:45:54,540
the case of rager car has been one of
the most intriguing and to,

1206
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:55,650
I don't know if I'm saying his name,
write,

1207
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,840
g.
R.

1208
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I.
C.

1209
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:57,840
A.
R.

1210
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,530
Kris Carr.
External.

1211
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,910
Truecar,
truecar.

1212
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,750
Nowhere is one of the most intriguing
talked about missing persons stories in

1213
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:05,910
the country.
Investigators have taken dives to the

1214
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:07,350
bottom of lakes,
dug up a grave,

1215
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:10,410
chase more than 300 reported sightings
from Arizona to North Carolina,

1216
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,100
drop flyers all over Slovenia.
Consulted a psychic,

1217
00:46:14,101 --> 00:46:17,670
interviewed a member of Hell's angels
and enlisted NASA technology,

1218
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:21,180
but no one's been able to find the
veteran disk ditch district attorney who

1219
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:22,500
was 59 when he disappeared.

1220
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,830
He went missing that Friday morning,
April 15th,

1221
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,920
2005 left behind a live in girlfriend,
beautiful and successful daughter and a

1222
00:46:28,921 --> 00:46:32,070
bank account that was supposed to fund a
fast approaching retirement.

1223
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,420
Oh,
here's where the problem was.

1224
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,630
He drove a red mini cooper.
Oh,

1225
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,980
well that was fun.
Just make people kill himself.

1226
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,160
As far as hard evidence goes,
it's a ball.

1227
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:44,850
The police had the best lead they got
was a sighting of a woman who has not

1228
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,080
been identified.
Bubba,

1229
00:46:46,081 --> 00:46:46,630
Bubba,
Bubba,

1230
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:48,870
but let's listen.
Find out the,

1231
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,660
the,
the conspiracy because the spirit was

1232
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:54,630
that he was a part of the Sandusky
investigation.

1233
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,590
Prevailing the serum.
This is the side d.

1234
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,250
Did you Google send Dusky?
There it is.

1235
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,190
Okay.
2011 when Penn state coordinator,

1236
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:04,290
Jerry Sandusky,
got arrested in charge of sexually

1237
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:05,610
abusing boys.
Where's vield that?

1238
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,750
Dzhokhar who decided notch charged
Sandusky when his first victim came

1239
00:47:09,751 --> 00:47:13,440
forward in 1998 Dzhokhar cited a lack of
evidence.

1240
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,650
The intrigue already simmering and
Dzhokhar's case exploded.

1241
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:19,080
Sluice desperately trying to find a link
between the two cases,

1242
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:21,870
but investigators said there's no
evidence that your car's appearance

1243
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,390
disappearance had anything to do with
sending Dusky crimes.

1244
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:25,980
Hmm.
That's not what I've read in another

1245
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:27,630
story.
Cis Guy Saying,

1246
00:47:27,631 --> 00:47:30,220
I don't think it was a great stretch.
He was one of those guys have very

1247
00:47:30,221 --> 00:47:32,170
strong sense of justice and professional
discipline.

1248
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:34,960
In light of what evolved and came to
beats closed,

1249
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:38,770
I speak as a forensic pathologist who's
done some so many suicides over the

1250
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,660
years and what can bring someone to that
point.

1251
00:47:40,661 --> 00:47:43,510
It's pure conjecture,
factual knowledge.

1252
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:45,280
Hold on a second.
Go back up.

1253
00:47:45,281 --> 00:47:46,930
Still Stop scrolling.
It says,

1254
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,470
the forensic pathologist said he
considered writing a book about your

1255
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:52,690
car,
his ties to the Sandusky case and

1256
00:47:52,691 --> 00:47:56,830
whether or not it lead to suicide.
So he said it was not enough evidence

1257
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:57,460
you'd have found him.

1258
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:58,960
When people kill themselves,
they want to be found.

1259
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,870
That's why they killed himself.
And sometimes most of the time,

1260
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:03,950
sometimes they just go in the woods and
blow their brains out,

1261
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,550
but in the fucking woods,
you know you don't,

1262
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:08,500
he got rid of all that.
You know how many people disappear in

1263
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:12,160
the woods every year?
Thousands and in North America,

1264
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:15,190
but a guide this prominent in his,
like in his work and in his life that

1265
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,200
has like that many,
he's got too many trails.

1266
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,520
Do you know what I mean?
Mini Cooper,

1267
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,680
that was isn't that fucking thing.
He's like,

1268
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:24,820
I got a backpack and a bullet and I'm
just going to fucking high deep enough

1269
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:28,150
to use all my water.
1600 people missing from our public

1270
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:30,260
lands without a trigger.
A lot of those people are hiking and she

1271
00:48:30,261 --> 00:48:31,600
lesson on every year.
Okay,

1272
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:33,250
I'm wrong.
It's like ever,

1273
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:36,510
I've been reading people at Vegan
method.

1274
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,040
It's about this,
that this happens a lot or was it,

1275
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:41,710
but that one was saying 1600 people are
missing.

1276
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,930
You know what I'm getting?
Here's where I'm getting my,

1277
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,460
how many people killed themselves
outside?

1278
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,010
Here's what I'm getting my information
from Bobcat goldthwait movie about big

1279
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:51,880
foot.
I just realized where I'm getting my

1280
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:56,400
numbers from because he has a movie
called Willow Creek and it's all about a

1281
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,690
big foot size that people are creeped
out with a growing number of missing

1282
00:48:58,691 --> 00:48:59,710
persons international park.
Yeah,

1283
00:48:59,711 --> 00:49:01,270
but a lot of these people go fucking
hiking.

1284
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,460
They don't go to kill themselves.
It's just people being foolish.

1285
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:04,330
Well,
here's the thing,

1286
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:06,100
man,
you don't have buddy of mine found a

1287
00:49:06,101 --> 00:49:10,930
skull when he was elk hunting humans,
Goldman skull while elk on how long has

1288
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:13,000
that has to be dead for to be fucking
deteriorate like that.

1289
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:13,690
She was mean.

1290
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,610
It was deteriorated like at first of
all,

1291
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:17,380
animals would get to it almost
immediately.

1292
00:49:17,381 --> 00:49:18,760
They smell it.
Birds come down.

1293
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:20,860
They started taking it apart.
Coyotes find it.

1294
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,900
Everything finds to be clean down to the
skull.

1295
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,670
That's got to be quick.
Really?

1296
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,181
Yeah,
you'd be,

1297
00:49:25,181 --> 00:49:28,510
you'd be surprised.
They'll clean you down to nothing in a

1298
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:29,320
couple of days.
Holy Shit.

1299
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,560
You'd be down to bones and day.
It's like that happens all,

1300
00:49:31,561 --> 00:49:34,840
it's if there's a population of animals
that are scavengers that are near your

1301
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:36,040
body.
Dude,

1302
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,410
a buddy of mine shot a deer.
Okay.

1303
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:41,890
And um,
it wasn't the best shot in the world.

1304
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:45,010
So he decided to let the deer bed down
to die.

1305
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,980
Like sometimes you'll hit the deer like
in one long or something like that.

1306
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:50,920
It wasn't the best shot and the deer bed
down and it was dark.

1307
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:55,060
It was getting dark like he shot at last
light where you legally allowed shoot.

1308
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,210
So they said we're going to come back in
the morning cause it's 30 degrees

1309
00:49:58,211 --> 00:49:59,860
outside.
The meat would be fine.

1310
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,740
They go back in the morning,
there's nothing gone.

1311
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:06,280
The coyotes ate everything except the
fucking head.

1312
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,990
Like,
I mean everything.

1313
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,800
Like he didn't get any of the rib meat.
All the organs were gone.

1314
00:50:11,801 --> 00:50:15,040
The legs were gone to down to the bone.
He said he'd never seen anything like

1315
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,990
it.
300 pound mule deer.

1316
00:50:16,991 --> 00:50:21,760
It's a big animal gone.
He said he saw like six or seven coyotes

1317
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:23,530
that day.
So he knew that coyotes were in the

1318
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:25,180
area.
But you just take a chance.

1319
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:26,830
He just like,
you could do one of two things.

1320
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:28,930
Either bumped the animal,
which means you,

1321
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,460
you go and it gets filled up with
adrenaline because it knows you're

1322
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,430
coming close to it and then it runs and
then they can run for a mile before they

1323
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:37,070
expire.
Or you just let it bed down there

1324
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,780
peacefully.
It'll just lay down and die.

1325
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,630
So that's what he chose.
His choice was just let it lay down and

1326
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:42,770
die with the coyotes.
Got to it.

1327
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,310
Fuck Dude.
300 pound animal to seven,

1328
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:48,050
eight coyotes,
whatever it was that did it.

1329
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:50,840
Maybe they called,
maybe other ones came from fucking half

1330
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,680
a mile away.
I mean Yo,

1331
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,120
this is deer.
Yo,

1332
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:55,610
this guy left.
There's a fucking fresh,

1333
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:59,060
it's Mike from the westwoods.
Yeah,

1334
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:01,010
I think he was in an area with no
wolves,

1335
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,700
so I think it was just all coyotes.
Coyotes.

1336
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,650
The coyotes out here in la are so small.
They're like little tiny house dogs.

1337
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,300
They're not like,
he had a little like bitch,

1338
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:11,140
frail,
weird.

1339
00:51:11,141 --> 00:51:12,940
Like where I golf up in the mountain up
there.

1340
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:16,840
We there all the time and they sit and
they wait for you to pass before they

1341
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,070
can go across,
you know,

1342
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,290
through the fairway and stuff,
but they're like little house dogs.

1343
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,690
They're like 15 pound house dog.
We are lucky.

1344
00:51:22,691 --> 00:51:25,240
Those things are here.
This is the sort of the truth because

1345
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:27,310
totally they weren't here.
They'd be rats everywhere.

1346
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,210
Yeah,
they eat every throws.

1347
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:31,480
Motherfuckers keep the rats in check to
keep the rabbits and check.

1348
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,000
There's a system.
There's an ecological system and it

1349
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,810
makes us uncomfortable because we don't
like to think about our own mortality

1350
00:51:37,811 --> 00:51:40,810
and something that wants to eat us,
but I like coyotes.

1351
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:43,190
I like them.
I had a chance to kill a coyote.

1352
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:46,160
They killed one of my chickens,
but I'm pretty sure that she had,

1353
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,910
I'm pretty sure she had puppies or cubs,
I guess they would cubs.

1354
00:51:49,911 --> 00:51:50,421
Yeah.
Yeah.

1355
00:51:50,421 --> 00:51:52,930
I'm pretty sure she had chicken.
Could have had it come into,

1356
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:54,960
you know,
didn't could've run its mouth and

1357
00:51:54,970 --> 00:51:56,160
chicken has a comment.
How about that?

1358
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,180
Jim is bound to go down and that
chicken,

1359
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:02,000
you have a common,
my daughter went on rabbits and I'm

1360
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:03,950
going to eat you.
My daughter's got rabbits.

1361
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:05,630
Uh Oh.
We're going to take care of it.

1362
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,580
You're not going to take care of it.
You're gonna play with those things

1363
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:08,960
twice and then you're going to leave him
alone.

1364
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:09,651
No,
no.

1365
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:12,200
We're going to take care of it.
Of course they don't take care of it.

1366
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,740
Yeah,
I'll give a fuck about those rabbits

1367
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:14,980
because they have a dog,
right?

1368
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,470
Dog and jostling.
Say you.

1369
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,760
Oh,
he lies down.

1370
00:52:20,761 --> 00:52:22,560
They rub his belly,
cause kisses.

1371
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:24,930
He runs around in circles.
You throw something,

1372
00:52:24,931 --> 00:52:26,700
he chases it.
It's way better.

1373
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,450
Nothing grab it just sits there.
You go near it,

1374
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,211
bite your finger.
Oh,

1375
00:52:30,211 --> 00:52:32,400
you can't throw that fucking thing.
But anyway,

1376
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:33,670
the rabbit,
uh,

1377
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:37,530
they live in the chicken coops,
big ass chicken coop and they follow the

1378
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:40,380
chickens around.
And today one of the rabbits was trying

1379
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:43,530
to eat the other chickens ass.
And so it's just falling around

1380
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:47,550
literally with his little rabbit face
buried in this chicken's asshole.

1381
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,260
And just in this chicken is trying to
get away.

1382
00:52:49,261 --> 00:52:53,280
But I kind of liken,
it was just bouncing around.

1383
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,900
I mean knows to asshole all around the
entire chicky case for like five

1384
00:52:59,101 --> 00:53:01,320
minutes.
It was so rigid.

1385
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:03,510
There's a sub category on porn hub for
that.

1386
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:05,100
There's got to be chicken rabbit porn on
there.

1387
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:05,970
Probably.
Yes.

1388
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,030
Probably animate though.
Yes.

1389
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,480
Yes.
Like enemies,

1390
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,990
subcategories of porn.
Some of the anime shit that I stumbled

1391
00:53:12,991 --> 00:53:16,170
upon is so fucking like the technical
stuff is this stuff that freaks me out

1392
00:53:16,171 --> 00:53:17,640
the most.
It's weird.

1393
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:20,390
People love people.
I don't know who likes watching a girl

1394
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:24,390
get fucked by like 19 technicals,
like jamming her eyeballs or mouth and

1395
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:25,990
her butthole and her and she had people

1396
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,950
jerk off to that.
Started off with with Japanese.

1397
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:33,150
For some reason somebody gave me an
explanation why Japanese dude like that.

1398
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,700
Yeah.
I think the explanation is that Japanese

1399
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:38,650
porn,
you're not allowed to show insertion

1400
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,980
penetration.
Yeah,

1401
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:43,290
it blurs.
You can't even show cartoon Dick's going

1402
00:53:43,291 --> 00:53:46,080
into Vaginas,
but you can show tentacles.

1403
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:47,011
Ah,
Shit.

1404
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:49,260
That makes sense.
So the fact that technicals look

1405
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:53,610
remotely similar to Dick's,
they've decided to just go with

1406
00:53:53,611 --> 00:53:57,920
tentacles and your mouth and spit flying
out of your mouth and,

1407
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,340
and they can't show jazz.
They can do,

1408
00:53:59,341 --> 00:54:01,410
but they can show technical juice.
You know what?

1409
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:04,020
They can show where the ges is all
pixelated.

1410
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,360
Like you can see the ges through a prism
dancing,

1411
00:54:06,361 --> 00:54:10,200
jazz pixelation.
You can't see the actual like hd four k

1412
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:14,460
ages.
Nobody like that would be too much for

1413
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:16,290
cages.
When I was a kid,

1414
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,050
you couldn't have hard ons in porn
magazines.

1415
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:22,320
They didn't have hard ons.
All the dudes had to have like limp

1416
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:23,490
dicks.
What?

1417
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:25,770
It was a law.
It was a federal law.

1418
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,980
You better put that.
You better get that dead serious.

1419
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,910
Like these guys had half hard Dick's.
They're always like half hard and it was

1420
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:35,190
so confusing because you'd be a little
kid.

1421
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:38,400
You Dick would be like a fucking total.
What's wrong with mine and you?

1422
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:41,640
You'd be so horny.
And he'd be looking at this magazine

1423
00:54:41,641 --> 00:54:44,490
like this guy's right there and he's not
even horny.

1424
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,100
He's right next to me.
He's like barely interested.

1425
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:50,910
There was a lot they had to have good
limp dicks.

1426
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:51,820
That's the trick.
Right?

1427
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,580
See that's what's fun inside lived.
He couldn't have a mushroom Kaplan.

1428
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:55,920
I'm a girl.
I'm a grower.

1429
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:56,790
Not show her.
Yeah,

1430
00:54:56,791 --> 00:54:59,370
you'd have to have a real hog,
like a heavy one.

1431
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,440
I'm nice when I'm thick,
but when I'm soft I can't be in the

1432
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,790
magazine side a bit about it.

1433
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:07,470
Before that the girl would be like her,
her mouth be open lipstick and her lips

1434
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,370
purse and her tongue hanging out in the
dude would have his limp Dick rested on

1435
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:13,980
her back like a drowning victim.
He pulled from a lake.

1436
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,650
It's like what is this?
And then you just take the time to get a

1437
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:21,570
hard on before we took these pictures,
man,

1438
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:23,100
the fuck.
It's so weird that that's a law.

1439
00:55:23,101 --> 00:55:25,050
That's a fucking,
that's all crazy standards and

1440
00:55:25,051 --> 00:55:26,670
practices.
A certain companies are as like,

1441
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:28,380
listen,
we'll let you show penises,

1442
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:31,440
but they can't be filled with blood.
I don't believe it's standards and

1443
00:55:31,441 --> 00:55:33,960
practices.
I think it was a federal law,

1444
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,200
but why would will be the difference of
showing pre vhs tapes.

1445
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,810
Once vhs tapes came along,
then people got to watch actual hard

1446
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:44,220
porno and there was like a loophole.
There was a loophole that existed

1447
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,240
because the pornographic magazines,
they weren't allowed to show insertion

1448
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,100
and they weren't allowed to show
erections.

1449
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,310
So there was this,
it was as weird and it wasn't that they

1450
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:56,340
couldn't show the lips of the vagina.
They had to be covered up by like hair.

1451
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,171
Right.
It was something like that.

1452
00:55:57,171 --> 00:55:59,550
Like they couldn't show hustler always
did though.

1453
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,331
I think,
well,

1454
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:02,040
they were the first one to do it.
Playboy never did.

1455
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,980
I know I always had bush.
Playboy would have like bear,

1456
00:56:04,981 --> 00:56:06,540
you'd barely see Bush,
you know,

1457
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:09,960
you'd see like a shadow of a Bush,
like girls looking pretty.

1458
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,430
Right.
Whereas hostler was like,

1459
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:14,310
let me watch you piss shit on his guy's
chest.

1460
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,850
Page one Pfister asshole.
Come on with.

1461
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,970
It was a different thing,
you know?

1462
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:24,310
But when,
when we would find these magazines like,

1463
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,293
oh,
he's in the woods.

1464
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:26,841
Yeah,
yeah,

1465
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,674
yeah,
yeah.

1466
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,590
I have a whole bit that's based on a
true story about fun and that what Larry

1467
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,550
Flint's like trials are kind of about.
I think so.

1468
00:56:33,551 --> 00:56:36,070
I think some of them were about that.
Yeah.

1469
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:38,950
But see,
obscenity is one of those weird things.

1470
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:40,400
And I know we attributed to,
uh,

1471
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,640
Vincent Scalia,
but people corrected me.

1472
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:46,870
Judge Scalia is that his name?
But it's not him that says Scalia,

1473
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,940
that guy,
it's not him that said this.

1474
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,490
It's another guy who said this.
I don't know what pornography is,

1475
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:54,180
but I know when I see it.
Oh yeah.

1476
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:56,140
Yeah.
Well there's another version of that too

1477
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:57,250
that's like,
I don't know what blank is,

1478
00:56:57,251 --> 00:56:58,330
but I know it when I see it.
Right,

1479
00:56:58,370 --> 00:56:59,380
right.
There's a few,

1480
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,930
probably the,
probably a few of those that erroneously

1481
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:02,980
attributed to people,
but,

1482
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:05,290
um,
there's a guy named Max hardcore.

1483
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:07,240
Do you remember that guy was a porn
actor?

1484
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:12,010
Yeah.
That guy went to jail for obscenity and

1485
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:17,011
he did hard time and he had some hard to
watch stuff.

1486
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,150
Like he had stumped some stuff.
You're like,

1487
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:20,080
wait a minute,
what?

1488
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,450
Like I found out about it because people
weren't like,

1489
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:24,240
hey man,
this is the great stuff to jerk off to.

1490
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:25,093
Right.
They were like,

1491
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,430
why you got wash this?
What in the fuck is this?

1492
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:31,690
This guy used a speculum to open this
girl's asshole.

1493
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,800
He pissed in her asshole and then he put
a straw and made her drink his piss out

1494
00:57:38,051 --> 00:57:40,210
of her own asshole.
I gotta get Outta here for a second.

1495
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:41,080
I got to go finish up.

1496
00:57:43,270 --> 00:57:46,930
But it was like there was a lot of like
really,

1497
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,450
really fucked up stuff website that
basis.

1498
00:57:49,451 --> 00:57:50,890
Do you know he fucked?
Do you ever heard of that?

1499
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,480
That's all they do is fucked up crazy.
Like there's nothing sexual about it.

1500
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,590
It's just,
it's just like defacing some buses

1501
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,680
fucked.
But the point is that this guy went to

1502
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:03,850
jail for that.
Like nobody else almost did prime to

1503
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:07,030
battle obscenity charges in Connecticut
and Cincinnati Rather.

1504
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,160
Um,
that's in 1,998 though.

1505
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:11,590
25 years in prison.
Wow.

1506
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:14,430
That's incredible.
Porn magnate and Haas or publisher,

1507
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:14,921
they're like,
wow,

1508
00:58:14,921 --> 00:58:16,000
that's crazy.
Oh wait a minute.

1509
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:20,500
Chart the same low cow where a judge and
jury sentenced him to 25 years in prison

1510
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:25,501
more than 20 years ago that he did.
So he did he actually go to jail time?

1511
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:27,350
He served time,
but yeah.

1512
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,700
Wow.
He was living in Columbus where I'm from

1513
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:32,680
and he set up his big house,
which he,

1514
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,650
from what I heard,
he had played on making it like a

1515
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:38,620
playboy mansion type place and it was
right next door to the Columbus School

1516
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:41,060
for girls and I think that causes some
of the first problems for him.

1517
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,010
Well,
it was just prospect.

1518
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,960
That's just smart.
That's a smart real estate.

1519
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,340
Yeah.
It's a good place to,

1520
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:47,830
if you're going to be decent and shot a
house near Lake.

1521
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:48,783
Yeah,
man.

1522
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,960
That just setting up shop,
just learning the territory,

1523
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,280
location,
location,

1524
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,350
location.
If you're a coyote,

1525
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,010
you know where the cats live.
Well that's like guy like perverts.

1526
00:59:00,011 --> 00:59:02,500
I got into selling ice cream to kids.
It was was like you can't play them.

1527
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:05,650
That's very intuitive.
It's like people think of that and to

1528
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:07,360
dismiss that,
that's not a big deal.

1529
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:10,810
Like the Larry Hall that Larry Flynt
Hustler think that's a very big deal.

1530
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,030
It's a very big deal.
They were trying to push this guy in

1531
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:15,910
jail for something that people enjoy
buying.

1532
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:16,930
Yep.
Cause I bought it.

1533
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:18,220
Yeah,
they liked it.

1534
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,940
That went for you got a hustler.
Yeah.

1535
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,160
Awesome.
What do you guys get his hand

1536
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,830
in his pants got hustler play in pocket
pool.

1537
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,570
Hot Tub.
Like they like it.

1538
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:28,190
They want to buy his product and you're
like,

1539
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,420
no,
you can't like it.

1540
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:32,210
What the fuck?
It's my favorite thing in the world.

1541
00:59:32,211 --> 00:59:34,190
You can't tell me what I like.
Yeah.

1542
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:35,960
I mean there was,
this wasn't that long ago,

1543
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:38,600
man.
Think about that 98 that's a 20th

1544
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,890
season.
That's crazy.

1545
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:42,920
20 years ago I almost went to jail.
I remember going with my dad to the

1546
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:45,920
movie rental place by his house and had
one of like those back rooms.

1547
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:46,430
No.
Yeah.

1548
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:49,760
You know what I mean?
Saloon doors to come in and as like a

1549
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:51,320
kid,
my dad would be like,

1550
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:52,100
where are you going?
It was like,

1551
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,980
oh look at a section over here.
And then he'd be on the other side and

1552
00:59:54,981 --> 00:59:56,620
he tried to like sneak in to take like a
peep.

1553
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,970
But even like the boxes and then they
got smart too.

1554
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,910
They put covers over the boxes.
So you get to like move a thing back to

1555
01:00:01,911 --> 01:00:04,190
see what the box was.
Well the thing that weird feeling was

1556
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:08,120
when you would go through those beads
and you would be in that room with those

1557
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:12,010
other perverts or just like super
uncomfortable to be near each other.

1558
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,390
We're all going to be doing the same
thing in 20 minutes.

1559
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:18,960
One time I went to an actual porn store.
What is it?

1560
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:20,660
What do you mean?
Like a hardcore store.

1561
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,890
I was like x,
x,

1562
01:00:21,891 --> 01:00:26,891
x videos like a shop and shit.
Like they sold dildos and videos.

1563
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:28,610
Right.
And that's all they sold.

1564
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:31,340
That was their big like let's stop
pretending it's got the shit,

1565
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,800
cut it out.
I'm going to go to the back room of a

1566
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:36,200
mom and pop store,
which says adults only.

1567
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,040
No,
no,

1568
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,450
this is like the whole store.
And you just felt so weird and the guy

1569
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,620
behind the counter is talking to me
like,

1570
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:43,261
hey man,
what's up?

1571
01:00:43,261 --> 01:00:44,094
I'm like,
hi,

1572
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:48,740
you fucking talk to me.
I'm uncomfortable that you guys have

1573
01:00:48,741 --> 01:00:51,080
sexual urges.
You guys are out creeps,

1574
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,520
not me.
I'm different.

1575
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:54,540
That's why I have to every guy in there
get out of,

1576
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:56,900
I like these guys fucking the other guys
in there,

1577
01:00:56,901 --> 01:00:58,210
but that's so annoying.
When they tried to talk to,

1578
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,290
I went to there.
There's one here,

1579
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,510
there's one in west Hollywood that's
like a sex store and the guy was like

1580
01:01:02,511 --> 01:01:04,220
being really friendly and he's like,
Hey,

1581
01:01:04,221 --> 01:01:04,971
what's up?
What's going on?

1582
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:07,340
It's like,
you know what's going on dude?

1583
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:08,330
It's,
this isn't target.

1584
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,970
I'm not maybe here for a vacuum or
greeting cards.

1585
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:12,530
Yeah,
we're not a fly tying.

1586
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,190
Oh Shit.

1587
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:16,130
I'm here for Weird Porno Shit.
Just let me get the thing and stop

1588
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,560
making me feel weird and tackle.
You're going to tell me about the best

1589
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:21,290
spots right now.
These barbers are pretty good man,

1590
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,180
but those dildos will do the trick and
tell you what,

1591
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:24,260
if you're just willing to take the
drive,

1592
01:01:24,261 --> 01:01:28,520
Sacramento La fucking salmon fishing is
off the chain anyway.

1593
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:33,660
Amount 42 bucks for this angel bead.
Here you go do to date and tackle and

1594
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:38,960
anal beads that
tackle and they end up fishing and

1595
01:01:38,961 --> 01:01:41,820
fucking fish place.
It'd be called like a fish.

1596
01:01:41,821 --> 01:01:43,490
You're like the fuck to I opened up this
shop,

1597
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:47,860
dude,
it's called fishing and fucking Ooh,

1598
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:53,630
tell he almost totally,
totally work.

1599
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,300
But the problem is nobody buys things
from a store anymore.

1600
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:59,720
You can just go order a Amazon fucking
Dildo online.

1601
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:02,900
You get it shipped to your house and one
day Amazon prime prime.

1602
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,700
Same Day.
If you get an early enough,

1603
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:07,280
this is a real legitimate question.
I'm not playing stupid.

1604
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,150
Does Amazon sell masturbating and tackle
our competition?

1605
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,400
These guys just beat around the bush.
We're fishing and fishing and fucking,

1606
01:02:15,401 --> 01:02:18,350
they masturbate all you want.
I brought a fuck rather fuck.

1607
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:20,190
You don't know what the fuck you're
talking about

1608
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,600
over here.
You're gonna fuck your own hand.

1609
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,950
I'm going to have somebody else.
Fuck it.

1610
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:27,330
Does Amazon Sell Rubber Dicks?
Ghada Ghada Jamie,

1611
01:02:27,331 --> 01:02:28,710
how many of you ordered from them?
Don't lie.

1612
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:30,300
And he's like,
yes,

1613
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,800
of course.
Worked for a company that did that,

1614
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:34,290
so I'm sure they'd sell them on Amazon.
That's sold rubber dicks.

1615
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:36,570
Yeah.
You know who sometimes sends me Rubber

1616
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:39,150
Dick's for and I asked a fleshlight
those people at flashlight and in Austin

1617
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,480
when I was doing moontower years ago,
I'd be friended a few of the people

1618
01:02:42,481 --> 01:02:44,100
there and they were like,
we'll send you some stuff.

1619
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,510
So they sent me like a few of the
flashlights,

1620
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:48,000
but they also sent me bags at Dick's
bags.

1621
01:02:48,001 --> 01:02:49,880
A Dick's rubber ducks on them.
You Go,

1622
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,900
you could buy a bunch of rubber Dick's,
you can get off.

1623
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,370
Did they have rubber vaginas or are they
discriminatory and anti male in their

1624
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:57,300
practices?

1625
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,790
Come on,
you fucks.

1626
01:02:59,791 --> 01:03:04,260
I don't see a single rubber vagina
sexist bullshit course because that

1627
01:03:04,261 --> 01:03:07,080
would be objectifying spank.
Spank Bank.

1628
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,850
What does that,
it's just an actual bank.

1629
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:12,840
Just poorly named frank fleshlight
daylight parody.

1630
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,010
Oh,
it's a show.

1631
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,270
It's a,
it's like a book.

1632
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,860
It looks like a book.
What did you type in,

1633
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:17,571
Jamie?
It's Al.

1634
01:03:17,571 --> 01:03:21,300
It's a song and type in men sex toy.
Do men sex toy.

1635
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:24,090
See if that does it.
Fleshlight was our original sponsor,

1636
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:27,090
the first sponsor of this podcast with a
flashlight.

1637
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,290
Just pills,
nothing.

1638
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:28,970
Jen,
Samer,

1639
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:31,320
Dick's all day long.
It's a rubber Dick.

1640
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:32,950
Is that a rubber Dick to put your Dick
Inside?

1641
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,880
That's the extender.
You put your tickets out of another

1642
01:03:35,881 --> 01:03:37,440
dick.
Penis extender.

1643
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,820
It says delay,
ejaculate.

1644
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:40,890
Wait,
there you go.

1645
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:44,700
We'll simulator the aircraft cup,
but look how they say it.

1646
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:46,510
Male simulate young girls,
nails,

1647
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,970
toys,
adult products.

1648
01:03:47,971 --> 01:03:48,990
They got every tag.

1649
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,910
Scroll back up to that Dick one.
Look at this.

1650
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,520
Look what it says.
It says delay.

1651
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:55,200
Ejaculations.
Yeah,

1652
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,450
like forever.
Like you'll never come.

1653
01:03:57,451 --> 01:03:59,730
You're not having sex.
Do you want to stop coming?

1654
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,880
Like put this on.
It's a big clear fake Dick that goes

1655
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,800
over your Dick had this guy,
Steve,

1656
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:06,960
come kick you in the cock.
You won't come for hours.

1657
01:04:07,830 --> 01:04:10,740
That's up fucking rough road for a dude
to the tiny deck.

1658
01:04:10,741 --> 01:04:13,800
If you have a micro Dick,
there is not a god damn the micro penis

1659
01:04:13,801 --> 01:04:16,260
saying there's nothing they can do.
How real is that though?

1660
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:17,460
It's real.
Is it real?

1661
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:20,820
Hundred percent you're so funny.
How real is that?

1662
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,500
Well,
how many people have micro penises for

1663
01:04:22,501 --> 01:04:23,490
real?
It's a real issue.

1664
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,920
Guys have like one inch dicks.
I think it's a real issue.

1665
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,500
An inch when it's filled with blood rock
hard,

1666
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,300
that's an inch rock hard.

1667
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,000
You got this.
That's their penis.

1668
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,380
The whole Dick.
Not even my full failure throw thinkers

1669
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:37,160
because it's too big because a lot of
guys are seeing this right now and going

1670
01:04:37,390 --> 01:04:41,010
like duke is that big said girls don't
care about so it was bro.

1671
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,090
It's not.
That's not,

1672
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,830
that's not what matters.
That's what they say to guys with little

1673
01:04:43,831 --> 01:04:44,521
ducks.
They go,

1674
01:04:44,521 --> 01:04:45,840
it's fine.
I love it.

1675
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,510
I like it.
I don't care.

1676
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:50,490
Really.
So you're saying this is a man that half

1677
01:04:50,491 --> 01:04:51,660
of that,
that's a man's penis.

1678
01:04:51,661 --> 01:04:54,780
Girls have no problem mocking it.
They would just mock it.

1679
01:04:54,781 --> 01:04:56,670
The market in front of her friends in
front of you,

1680
01:04:56,790 --> 01:04:57,840
like guys,
a little dicks.

1681
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,360
It says high.
It was all I all,

1682
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:03,390
I couldn't fucking debt.
I scan because you can't retire.

1683
01:05:03,391 --> 01:05:05,040
You can't be like can you push these
big?

1684
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,590
But if a guy did talk like that,
he would be a monster.

1685
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:09,590
Like a guy was talking about a giant
poster.

1686
01:05:09,591 --> 01:05:10,830
Yo Dude,
I had a breakup with her.

1687
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,560
My balls would fall in.
I'd be fucking,

1688
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,570
I'd be strapping a two by four to my
ass.

1689
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:16,950
No.
See I was lacking from getting sucked

1690
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,930
into the boy.
Four questions about the life of the

1691
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:23,440
micro penis reveals about the folding
0.6% of the population to see.

1692
01:05:23,441 --> 01:05:24,730
It's enough.
That's enough.

1693
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,820
That's dude.
That's if you have a hundred people that

1694
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:30,400
means what?
How many people is that less than one?

1695
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:33,940
Not even one.
No wait 6.6 so 200 people.

1696
01:05:33,941 --> 01:05:36,180
You have one two to 1.2 yeah.
Right.

1697
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,860
That's a lot.
200 people.

1698
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:42,010
So if you at the comedy store six out of
a thousand that's right.

1699
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,920
If you're the comedy store,
just two people in the room on a full

1700
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:47,260
house on Saturday night that I have,
my one guy has a micro tech,

1701
01:05:47,261 --> 01:05:48,790
well you gotta think it's 50 50 men
women.

1702
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,440
So one guy in that room was a micro
Dick.

1703
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,180
So if you make a joke about a micro
Dick,

1704
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,014
one guy's like,
okay,

1705
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:53,853
no,

1706
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:56,580
the joke before,
he loves so much,

1707
01:05:56,581 --> 01:05:58,210
he's still laughing,
but in his head he's like,

1708
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,260
no,
don't you agree when you're shitting on

1709
01:06:01,261 --> 01:06:03,300
giant pussies,
this guy's the best.

1710
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:06,960
I love the major pussy joke.
They're too big because these are just

1711
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:10,200
too big and they are too big.
It doesn't get in the way.

1712
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,270
Perfect.
If want to have to urinate,

1713
01:06:12,271 --> 01:06:14,850
it's there from me.
But that's crazy to think if a girl

1714
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:18,480
dates a guy with a micro penis and she
just sticks around because she was like,

1715
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:19,314
well,
he's a good dude.

1716
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,820
Well,
um,

1717
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:25,560
I know a lady who had a few children,
she had three children with a

1718
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:28,020
microphone,
decided no with a regular peanuts guy.

1719
01:06:28,021 --> 01:06:30,090
He's a handsome fellow.
I'm sure it was quite a sturdy cock.

1720
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:32,790
Paul,
like an ax handle hefty.

1721
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,220
He looks like he's of Viking.
Um,

1722
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:36,540
but anyway,
uh,

1723
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:41,010
those kids had a blown a hole through
the old car port and so she decided to

1724
01:06:41,011 --> 01:06:44,310
get everything all stitched up.
She said it was the most painful thing

1725
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:47,160
that she'd ever done.
Totally more painful than childbirth

1726
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:50,520
because they go in there and cut.
I'll say that again.

1727
01:06:55,230 --> 01:07:00,060
They cut and then they stitch that bitch
up to like a finger gets broken when you

1728
01:07:00,061 --> 01:07:04,200
put it in there.
It's like tighter than anal and I'm

1729
01:07:05,010 --> 01:07:08,100
unbelievably painful and I can't even
strap yourself in.

1730
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,160
Num Num num goes numb because like you
ever have surgery when they cut all

1731
01:07:14,581 --> 01:07:16,760
those nerves,
a lot of times that nerve damage.

1732
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:18,480
Yeah.
Like my knee,

1733
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:22,860
I had a acl reconstruction on one of my
knees with what's called a Patella

1734
01:07:22,861 --> 01:07:24,810
tendon graft.
They open you up,

1735
01:07:24,811 --> 01:07:27,060
they'd take a big,
like foreign slice.

1736
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,840
They open you up and they take a piece
of your patella tendon,

1737
01:07:30,841 --> 01:07:32,760
screw all these things and stitch it
back up.

1738
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,670
That whole area.
I had that thing done in like,

1739
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:39,960
fuck 1994 it's still numb.
Like my knees numb.

1740
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:41,520
None of the nerves have repaired.
No,

1741
01:07:41,521 --> 01:07:43,050
not over where the,
uh,

1742
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:45,540
the incision is.
It's taught like I'm touching it right

1743
01:07:45,541 --> 01:07:45,960
now.

1744
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,300
I literally,
it feels like someone stuck novacane in

1745
01:07:48,301 --> 01:07:49,650
it.
I can touch to the left.

1746
01:07:49,651 --> 01:07:50,820
I feel it.
I touch to the right.

1747
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:52,290
I feel it.
I touched right with that.

1748
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:53,430
Scar tissue is,
it's numb.

1749
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:55,170
Nothing.
Your pussy can go numb too,

1750
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,510
bro.
My Pussy will never go numb,

1751
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,250
bro.
You pussy can go numb bro.

1752
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:02,730
Fishing and fuck and you pussy Mako
numb.

1753
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,940
Yeah.
Well fishing and fuck.

1754
01:08:03,941 --> 01:08:08,770
And you just got to have a beer can
sized hog to fill that gap or you got a

1755
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,530
gapper a tall boy.
I can't imagine the pain of that shit.

1756
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,770
The only thing that I,
that I know the most painful thing I

1757
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:16,810
ever had was when they stick a fucking a
tube in,

1758
01:08:16,811 --> 01:08:18,200
in your,
in your Dick Hole,

1759
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:21,880
when they're fucking testing you for
shit and they fucking shove up to the,

1760
01:08:22,150 --> 01:08:25,370
Oh my God dude,
that's a pain that I never want to feel

1761
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:26,030
over again.

1762
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:27,620
Well,
I just would assume that they would have

1763
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:30,200
figured out a way to fix dicks.
I think they think that's funny.

1764
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:31,460
I think they're just like,
fuck them.

1765
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,900
I don't think there's anything they can
do.

1766
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,260
Does it all the way around.
Crispr crispr is going to come around

1767
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,110
and that's going to fucking,
you know what crispr is as Jeanette,

1768
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:44,140
this is new tool that they have to a
altered genes and altered dna where you

1769
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:47,150
can like pick baby shit.
You gonna be able to pick baby shift for

1770
01:08:47,151 --> 01:08:48,190
sure.
That's wild.

1771
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,780
That's 100% they're probably already
doing it in China.

1772
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:55,700
Sort of six to 18 years from now,
the Olympic Games,

1773
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,700
we're going to see some just genetic
freaks from going to be amazing.

1774
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:00,590
I can't wait.
We're going to be like,

1775
01:09:00,591 --> 01:09:03,080
wait,
what the fuck is that person?

1776
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,390
14 year olds for the air breaking
records.

1777
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:10,150
Fucking quadruple somil over people or
they're playing basketball,

1778
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,570
Adh,
vertical leaps and shit.

1779
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,750
They're gonna like jump from the free
throw line and the other side of the

1780
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:17,840
court and do flip through the air and
slam dunk and everyone's going to go,

1781
01:09:17,841 --> 01:09:18,560
wait,
what?

1782
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,670
No,
everyone's going to go off ma.

1783
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:20,504
Yeah,
seen it.

1784
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,820
At that point we'll be just a normal
fucking thing.

1785
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:24,800
Did you see that video that I sent it to
you Jamie?

1786
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:27,470
That dog that jumps through the air and
you can't,

1787
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:29,990
you literally can't believe how high the
dog jumps.

1788
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,030
Did I say I'm going to send it,
I'll send it to you right now,

1789
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:35,240
but is this I sent it to,
I know I sent it to Cowen cause he's a

1790
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:39,260
sharp are both dog freaks but it doesn't
even make any sense.

1791
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:41,000
Like you,
you look at the video and you go like,

1792
01:09:41,001 --> 01:09:43,190
what the fuck this one?
Nope.

1793
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,760
That's not it.
But let me see this dog.

1794
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:45,833
Let me see that one.

1795
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,760
We are the body on the other thing.
Little Stud jacked here.

1796
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:55,540
He goes,
boy.

1797
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:57,740
Oh,
he's running up the wall and I've seen

1798
01:09:57,741 --> 01:09:59,570
this crazy.
This stuff is insane.

1799
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:02,690
It's crazy.
That dog just jumped.

1800
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,850
It looks like he jumped 18 feet in the
air.

1801
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:07,190
He did it least right?
Yeah.

1802
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:11,930
That looks like 18 feet and he bites the
rope and so that it pulls them down

1803
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:13,930
slowly so he doesn't get hurt.
That's amazing.

1804
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:15,480
The guy helps it.
Guy Catches him to do.

1805
01:10:15,481 --> 01:10:19,550
That's a fucking crazy dog.
Pit Bull can leap four meter walls.

1806
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:21,920
What?
Four meters?

1807
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,260
They're not regular dogs,
man.

1808
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:27,500
Look at us.
See Fecha Veggie at Holy Shit.

1809
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,630
That is incredible.
Find this fucking dog.

1810
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,170
Oh,
also I wanted to ask you about this.

1811
01:10:36,171 --> 01:10:38,110
Have you seen mass wrestling?
Do you know what that is?

1812
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,580
Mass wrestling.
Do you know what it is that type that

1813
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:41,480
in?
This is nuts.

1814
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,360
Mass wrestling.
Before I forget it,

1815
01:10:44,361 --> 01:10:46,700
I wanted to tell you about it.
People like there's like a,

1816
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:47,990
there's like a bar.
Look at this.

1817
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,940
What are they doing?
They,

1818
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,980
there's like a bar.
Do they both have to grip onto and

1819
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:54,840
they're pulling it or the coaching you
get legs.

1820
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:56,640
How many people die doing this?
Ah,

1821
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:58,290
isn't this fucking insane?

1822
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:01,490
Do a lot of weight.
Ton.

1823
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:01,971
I mean,
Dude,

1824
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:05,030
look at these two dudes.
It's all that's all grip and leg

1825
01:11:05,031 --> 01:11:05,870
strength and shit.

1826
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:08,030
Yeah,

1827
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,760
it's wild as shit.
I got watched like 50 videos of it.

1828
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:12,050
I got so soaked into it.
I was like,

1829
01:11:12,051 --> 01:11:12,591
how?
Why?

1830
01:11:12,591 --> 01:11:13,560
Why are people doing this?

1831
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,350
It's like tug of war with like a
statement with something stable.

1832
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:18,390
You know,
I'm sending it to you right now,

1833
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:19,740
Jamie.
You got to see this.

1834
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:21,630
Uh,
it looks like we'll do these guys.

1835
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,470
Are they blurring out that guy's hog?
I would like that it was a hog butt ass

1836
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:26,011
naked.
I mean,

1837
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:28,140
I originally got in the right light.
There's a little pixelation.

1838
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:30,180
I originally got into this because I was
jerking off to it.

1839
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:32,880
That's why I wanted to see this stick.
I thought they had their hand.

1840
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,010
So they're holding on holding on this
like this.

1841
01:11:35,011 --> 01:11:35,351
This,
yeah,

1842
01:11:35,351 --> 01:11:38,160
like the guy on the left is winning,
but he's all arms.

1843
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:41,190
Look at his little bitch ass legs.
I got my money on the guy on the right.

1844
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,610
I don't like the way the guy on the
right or the left rather has

1845
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:47,490
overdeveloped his arms and
underdeveloped his legs.

1846
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,550
That guy's going to quit.
They got in the left.

1847
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:51,890
Yeah,
he's got no legs down.

1848
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,150
That's going to give out.
The guy on the right is Russian.

1849
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,690
It looks like he's from a hut in the
middle of Siberia.

1850
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:59,310
He,
his whole family lives in a yurt.

1851
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,920
You have to kill him.
The left did not run.

1852
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,810
Look at his legs like he'll get his
calves.

1853
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,880
That guy's not,
he's not fit.

1854
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:06,840
See,
told you.

1855
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:09,780
That's why I'm a good mma commentator
called it.

1856
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:11,610
I know when I see it,
dude,

1857
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:15,510
it's just like he's jacked.
You look at his upper body and his

1858
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:18,420
forearms and shit and his biceps and his
shoulders.

1859
01:12:18,421 --> 01:12:19,740
I'm like,
the guys jacked.

1860
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:22,770
There's no leg strength there,
but he's got zero in his legs,

1861
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:26,520
which means his mind is weak.
That's what it means.

1862
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:29,370
His mind his week.
He wants everybody to think he's strong,

1863
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,230
but he's not doing the real hard work.

1864
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,120
Nobody gives a fuck.
If you're doing squats,

1865
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,190
you don't,
nobody notices.

1866
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,740
Okay.
If you do push ups and you do bench

1867
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:40,470
press and you're fucking tits pop out,
everybody sees it,

1868
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,420
watch this dog.
You ain't gonna Shit.

1869
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,730
You ain't even going to believe this.
This doesn't even seem real.

1870
01:12:44,731 --> 01:12:49,731
Look at this dog flies.
I think that's a Belgian malinois flies

1871
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:52,530
whole just flies.
And then they have them land on a

1872
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:53,640
cushion,
which is pretty sweet.

1873
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:55,470
Look when he jumps off that guy's
shoulder,

1874
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:58,800
the guy shoulders.
But that's gotta be 23 lead jumps.

1875
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:03,090
I mean it's at least 15.
He's at least 15 feet in the air.

1876
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,480
What's even cooler is a dog that he's
flying.

1877
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,980
Um,
the,

1878
01:13:08,020 --> 01:13:10,440
uh,
it's send it official on instagram one

1879
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:12,240
all one word,
send it official.

1880
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:15,390
That's a one of them instagram page that
has a bunch of crazy shit on it.

1881
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,580
It's always,
there's a lot of those that are pretty

1882
01:13:17,581 --> 01:13:18,361
good.
I follow.

1883
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:20,910
A lot of them will do the original,
like the send it quote,

1884
01:13:20,911 --> 01:13:21,460
you know,
that's from,

1885
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,280
you've seen those guys that,
have you seen those guys?

1886
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:24,270
He's like,
come on Marty.

1887
01:13:24,271 --> 01:13:27,900
Stand at and he just like jumped shocks
and fucking just do that makes me laugh

1888
01:13:27,901 --> 01:13:29,670
so hard.
Every time he's like,

1889
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:30,421
what'd you go do?
He's like,

1890
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:34,830
I'm a fucking sand it truck.
It just shoots it off a shitty fucking

1891
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:36,750
ramp.
Hold my beer while I send the fucking

1892
01:13:36,751 --> 01:13:39,000
sand it.
Have you seen hold this beer on twitter?

1893
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:40,080
If you ever seen that?
I call my beer.

1894
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:43,020
Yeah.
I think it's hold this hold.

1895
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,410
This is the actual twitter account,
but it says hold my beer is the name of

1896
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:47,011
it.
Oh right,

1897
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:47,450
right,
right,

1898
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:48,360
right.
That one is,

1899
01:13:48,630 --> 01:13:50,880
that's an hold.
My beer can't go wrong with that one.

1900
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:51,870
No,
that stuff's hilarious.

1901
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:54,090
If you can deal with it,
if you can deal with it,

1902
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:57,780
cause sometimes you're going to watch
people that are to get absolute brain

1903
01:13:57,781 --> 01:14:01,110
damage,
but I love it whenever it's not me.

1904
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:05,670
There's one where a dude is standing on
a hill and a bale of hay is coming

1905
01:14:05,671 --> 01:14:08,670
towards him and his bail hay.
It looks like it might waste six 700

1906
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:09,450
pounds.
Right.

1907
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,950
And it's huge.
He's taken,

1908
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:12,100
jumps up into the

1909
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:16,390
air like he's trying to get over it and
he does it make it and he goes fucking

1910
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:18,940
flying and he got hit by a bus.
I love that shit.

1911
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,100
I mean the dude goes,
if you ever seen a bay,

1912
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:22,210
one of those big ass.
Yeah,

1913
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:24,610
circle.
Bill's a hail it bigger than this table.

1914
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:26,980
Huge.
Those are so fucking bigger than a truck

1915
01:14:26,981 --> 01:14:30,190
tire.
They're so heavy and this dumb fuck

1916
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:34,420
thought he was going to jump over it.
My favorite is grossly overestimate how

1917
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:37,180
well there it is.
Come on dude.

1918
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:39,950
My sister again,
I mean the fact that he's alive,

1919
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,060
fucked up.
He is lucky he's not paralyzed.

1920
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:47,370
Look at this.
Boom.

1921
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,200
I mean he did a full flip through the
air.

1922
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:55,600
That fucking thing is so heavy.
You just no way you would pick that up.

1923
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,010
You know my favorite is the medicine
balls.

1924
01:14:57,011 --> 01:14:57,980
When people bump the,
you know,

1925
01:14:57,981 --> 01:15:00,190
and they would be able to do medicine
ball challenge where they run at each

1926
01:15:00,191 --> 01:15:01,024
other.

1927
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:03,670
If you ever seen that,
they'll tow both grab a medicine ball,

1928
01:15:03,671 --> 01:15:05,890
run shot at full speed and jumping and
whoever gets hit the furthest,

1929
01:15:06,010 --> 01:15:08,170
but sometimes people do with their kids.
Oh Chin.

1930
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:11,770
Like a Dan will be just fucking around.
You see a kid go flying 30 feet in the

1931
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:13,060
room.
Jesus Christ.

1932
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,910
Oh that's my favorite shit.
I love there's a,

1933
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:17,590
there was one on there that's like fail
army or fail blog or something and they

1934
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:20,470
showed the same kind of fucking stuff
where people would just have this crazy

1935
01:15:20,471 --> 01:15:23,800
idea of what they would do to get away
from things that other people aren't

1936
01:15:23,801 --> 01:15:26,590
doing.
It totally charged fucking sidestep.

1937
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,490
I'd decide stuff.
Um,

1938
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,260
that was,
that's always jump over it.

1939
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:34,320
That's always been an inside joke in a
mma forums about sidestepping that uh,

1940
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:37,130
if someone who's coming after me,
I just fucking side sides,

1941
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:38,470
I'll admit,
I just sidestep.

1942
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,260
Most people just don't know what to do.
They stand there and freeze.

1943
01:15:41,261 --> 01:15:43,870
I just charged up get all the way,
like I got it planned out.

1944
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,400
People are going to swarm you,
swarm you like a Zombie bite your face.

1945
01:15:48,401 --> 01:15:49,231
Like wait,
which side?

1946
01:15:49,231 --> 01:15:50,040
Snapping them.
Dude.

1947
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,520
Sidestep.
Sidestep a mall.

1948
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,030
But people think they could do or if
they're forking bowl was coming after me

1949
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,090
or just step aside matadors or faggots
with total fucking punch.

1950
01:15:59,100 --> 01:15:59,950
I'll use your,
uh,

1951
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:02,350
we'll use your fake martial arts videos.
Those guys.

1952
01:16:02,351 --> 01:16:04,090
Those are my fucking dude.
Those are my favorite.

1953
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,600
I resist putting those videos up cause
there's so many of them get sent to me.

1954
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:09,490
It,
I can't keep putting him up.

1955
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,980
The guy that like a wind technique like
with his breath is because the other

1956
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:16,870
guy,
great page on instagram.

1957
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:20,500
Make Dojo.
Is it Mick Dojo or mcdo Joe Life.

1958
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,930
I forget which one it is.
We told you a life.

1959
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,940
We mic Dojo.
Mic Dojo.

1960
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,580
They call them macdill like a Dojo is a
martial arts school.

1961
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:30,100
Nick Doe Joe's like a mall martial arts
school.

1962
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:33,940
That's what we would call like cheesy,
shitty martial arts schools.

1963
01:16:33,941 --> 01:16:35,290
Mick Dojo,
watch this guy.

1964
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,580
Watch this guy go go full screen on this
one.

1965
01:16:37,581 --> 01:16:39,400
And he just wants to fucking
preposterous.

1966
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:42,820
The guy comes out and with a sword and
he uses his power and the guy goes

1967
01:16:42,821 --> 01:16:43,680
flying.
I buy,

1968
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:46,060
I buy every second of it.
Old Japanese guy.

1969
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,690
I buy this goofy white guys who would
have been the guys in boyle heights.

1970
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,520
They were saying,
we're here for your community.

1971
01:16:51,521 --> 01:16:56,521
We love
that.

1972
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,810
They would be the same guy.
He's old,

1973
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:03,280
Dorky liberal guys who probably call
themselves feminists and they just

1974
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:05,440
flying through the air with her.
Kido suits aren't,

1975
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:09,410
he is fucking this guy up.
He's fit fucking this dude.

1976
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,650
He leads him around and then sit down to
the ground.

1977
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:14,330
Well,
you know as a feminism,

1978
01:17:14,450 --> 01:17:17,330
more likely to get tossed around.
It's almost looks like a coordinated

1979
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:21,410
dance.
It's so silly.

1980
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:23,360
They're also silly.
What does that one next to it?

1981
01:17:23,361 --> 01:17:25,520
The guy with the karate outfit.
What is he going to do?

1982
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:29,220
Is that a girl or guy to guy?
Oh,

1983
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:32,840
oh my God.
He's doing flips on his head,

1984
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:35,480
breaking the boards and then flipping
onto his feet.

1985
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,840
So he's crushing or the blocks of stone
with his head.

1986
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:41,450
Yup.
What does it sound like?

1987
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,790
Oh
my God,

1988
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,680
he's doing it like,
like flipping

1989
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:53,043
one more.

1990
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:56,700
Yea He did it.
If that ever comes up,

1991
01:17:57,270 --> 01:18:00,960
do you need to flip and land on
someone's Dick that guys at taekwondo

1992
01:18:00,961 --> 01:18:02,940
outfit on?
That doesn't make any sense to me.

1993
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,810
That's so weird.
What could those be made out of the

1994
01:18:06,811 --> 01:18:10,460
shittiest rock known demand?
Like if you pissed on it,

1995
01:18:10,461 --> 01:18:12,540
we'll probably break.
It can't be rock.

1996
01:18:12,930 --> 01:18:13,721
Yeah,
it's,

1997
01:18:13,721 --> 01:18:18,060
it's some sort of shitty ass bitch ass
concrete pit yet.

1998
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,260
Did you get that bag of bitch ass
concrete?

1999
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:23,340
We ordered.
Yeah man you got some bitch ass.

2000
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:27,420
Fuck people up breaking shit with my
head.

2001
01:18:29,070 --> 01:18:32,130
But there's a lot of people out there
that buy into that stupid stuff man.

2002
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:35,250
But my point about it is like there's a
lot of people that buy in anything.

2003
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:37,890
That's why people join cults.
That was why people,

2004
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:43,220
they fall into these ideas and they
believe him wholeheartedly and then you

2005
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:48,150
know are new religious like the all the
new cool religions where like the dude's

2006
01:18:48,151 --> 01:18:49,320
are like,
remember,

2007
01:18:49,321 --> 01:18:51,870
I think I talked to you about it where
like there's these new motivational

2008
01:18:51,871 --> 01:18:55,230
speak speak churches where it's like
that's all it is.

2009
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:58,740
Yeah.
I read about one recently that uses a

2010
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:03,770
friend of mine synagogue from where a
friend of mine goes for his service.

2011
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:06,000
He's Jewish where he,
him and his family go.

2012
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:10,490
These people rent it out like on some
days and they'd come down,

2013
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,080
they have this rock and roll sort of
rock and roll church,

2014
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:17,160
but the guys like this charismatic Sorta
Halfass Waco Dude and they're all good

2015
01:19:17,161 --> 01:19:21,240
looking like Koresh type shit.
It's like five or six of these guys with

2016
01:19:21,241 --> 01:19:25,200
varying degrees of bullshit a tube and
they're all,

2017
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:26,550
they're all rich.
They're all tall,

2018
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:27,510
super,
super rich.

2019
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,800
Tons of money,
man.

2020
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:31,500
Well,
especially if they can get like young,

2021
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:34,490
really wealthy people who are not long
good looking kids.

2022
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,820
My friend went to one,
he was saying,

2023
01:19:35,821 --> 01:19:36,181
he was like,
dude,

2024
01:19:36,181 --> 01:19:37,320
you have to see that.
He's like,

2025
01:19:37,321 --> 01:19:39,660
the women that were there were,
every one of them was gorgeous.

2026
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:42,600
Yeah.
My buddy had a personal assistant,

2027
01:19:42,601 --> 01:19:46,710
he was a producer of a TV show and he
had a personal assistant and his

2028
01:19:46,711 --> 01:19:50,040
personal assistant was,
she was nice,

2029
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:53,280
but she was off like she was just,
it was,

2030
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,930
there was some wires,
it would just,

2031
01:19:56,370 --> 01:19:58,740
you know,
[inaudible] they just weren't

2032
01:19:58,741 --> 01:19:59,401
connecting.
Right.

2033
01:19:59,401 --> 01:20:01,020
And she started going to this church.
He's like,

2034
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:03,270
you would love it because it's not like
a regular church.

2035
01:20:03,271 --> 01:20:07,500
Like we just sang the whole things.
We talk about thing.

2036
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,280
They give us a haircut.

2037
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,810
Your life like,
okay,

2038
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:12,030
do you have to give him money?
Like how's that work?

2039
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:13,050
Tons of money.
Let's talk.

2040
01:20:13,051 --> 01:20:15,360
And then you give me money.
I don't have any services.

2041
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:17,730
I give,
I'm not really big on services.

2042
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,980
The law get together and talk and then I
get paid.

2043
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:22,950
And then how like mansions,
I like to live in a magic.

2044
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,010
So we'll we're gonna do is I'm going to
regurgitate some anthony robins quotes

2045
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:29,010
and I'm going to tell you about life it
and then a little bit of Jesus.

2046
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:31,580
I'm gonna throw some Jesus in there to
seem legit little sprinkle of Jesus.

2047
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:33,270
We love Jesus.
We're not heavy.

2048
01:20:33,271 --> 01:20:34,920
Jesus.
You know,

2049
01:20:34,921 --> 01:20:36,090
we're,
we're like Paleo.

2050
01:20:36,091 --> 01:20:38,920
Ask
Paleo Church,

2051
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:41,610
Paleo.
But we also like spaghetti.

2052
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:42,863
It's like,
it's okay,

2053
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,060
I'll snack on it.
Snuck on Spaghetti.

2054
01:20:45,061 --> 01:20:46,290
Jesus teens.
I'm going to,

2055
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,650
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm not going to,

2056
01:20:47,670 --> 01:20:48,300
I can't say no.

2057
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,010
I'm not willing to give up my salting.
Nope.

2058
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:52,110
You know,
I would go paleo if it wasn't for

2059
01:20:52,111 --> 01:20:54,270
crackers.
I like Ritz.

2060
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:56,790
I like to put on the bits every now and
then I want to put on the wrist.

2061
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,070
This is what I like putting on the Ritz.
Give me money.

2062
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:00,181
Yeah,
man,

2063
01:21:00,181 --> 01:21:03,030
there's a lot of loss people out there.
Uh,

2064
01:21:03,031 --> 01:21:05,880
and then there's people that come along
and then the capitalize on it,

2065
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,430
on those lost people and then they
figure out like,

2066
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:10,320
oh,
there's a market and capitalizing on

2067
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:13,410
loss people and they ramp that shit up.
Total hopper.

2068
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:16,590
You know who I find is the big who like
makes now that now that like,

2069
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:18,510
because I'm like buying all sorts of
stuff for this puppy.

2070
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:20,610
The Co,
the stuff I should have gotten into was

2071
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:22,680
like tricking people into needing pet
stuff.

2072
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:25,290
Like if I got to vent a pet thing,
like what thing would you invent?

2073
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:29,330
Invent one right now we can just see no
started out in the front of fucking it.

2074
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,820
Just put it out.
You've got your and your dog toys right?

2075
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:34,720
When you get to that register,
I'll tell you what,

2076
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:37,170
that's when you're most susceptible to
impulse buy.

2077
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,830
That's where we put dollars jet blue.
So puppy toy or some shit.

2078
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,120
Puppy Dildo.
Be Great.

2079
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:44,760
If the store was empty and all you had
was stuck by the register cause you're

2080
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:46,680
like they don't buy out there man.
They buy right here.

2081
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,980
That's all we did.
And fucking fishing.

2082
01:21:47,981 --> 01:21:50,790
Ride the register.
It's a robot fuck doll for your dog.

2083
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:55,350
I thought about it.
I been thinking about this for 25 years.

2084
01:21:55,410 --> 01:21:58,200
It's a robot phone that I've got these
Japanese scientists involved and we

2085
01:21:58,201 --> 01:22:00,710
figured out the perfect height.
You don't really need all can fuck it.

2086
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,190
Don't snip your dog man.
Don't,

2087
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:04,050
don't fucking don't neutered or spayed
or nothing.

2088
01:22:04,051 --> 01:22:08,730
Just tell you what your robot photo
misconception is that a big dog can't

2089
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:10,950
fuck a little robot dog.
Cause again,

2090
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:12,150
watch,
he'll get low.

2091
01:22:12,210 --> 01:22:16,140
So this is like,
you don't really need the one that you

2092
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:18,330
can't sell after your dog dies.

2093
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:24,150
And then I came in,
you got a dog dude.

2094
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:25,390
You know,
ever since Ross,

2095
01:22:25,391 --> 01:22:27,570
he died,
his robot fuck dogs just been sitting in

2096
01:22:27,571 --> 01:22:29,280
the garage had been hoping it's,
it's sad.

2097
01:22:29,281 --> 01:22:34,281
Someone could come on and come in it,
it'd be bop one more humans and just to,

2098
01:22:36,541 --> 01:22:39,210
just for their youth.
That is an issue when your dog tries to

2099
01:22:39,211 --> 01:22:43,170
Hump your kids like
problem.

2100
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:44,220
Yeah.
My uh,

2101
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,550
my massive has a,
has humped people before you got to let

2102
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:48,510
one kid go,
you gotta go.

2103
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:50,040
Yeah.
You've got to sacrifice the one you

2104
01:22:50,041 --> 01:22:50,910
liked the least.
You know what I mean?

2105
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:54,540
Anything disturbing about 140 pound dog
named Johnny Cash and wants a hump your

2106
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,220
leg,
you know,

2107
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,350
he's a sweet dog.
But if he wasn't,

2108
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,610
if you wasn't to be a real issue
problem,

2109
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:04,890
your real problem.
Yeah.

2110
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,093
What do you say?

2111
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:07,470
Hey,
hey,

2112
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:12,250
cut the shit and they look at you and go
[inaudible] hold in front of you do it

2113
01:23:12,251 --> 01:23:13,900
all the time.
This is what feels good to me.

2114
01:23:14,170 --> 01:23:17,320
It feels good to me and I'm doing it.
Did you ever have moments where you were

2115
01:23:17,321 --> 01:23:20,110
when your dogs have ever seen you like
jerking off or having sex or anything

2116
01:23:20,111 --> 01:23:20,621
like that?
No.

2117
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:21,960
Jury got in front of my dogs.
Never.

2118
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,260
Or have sex in front of him.
No,

2119
01:23:23,620 --> 01:23:25,540
I did.
I do it first day just to let them know.

2120
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:27,820
I've heard about people that are having,
I'm going to do it all comes in and

2121
01:23:27,821 --> 01:23:29,800
starts licking their feet.
I've heard that kind of shit.

2122
01:23:29,870 --> 01:23:31,270
Yeah.
Heard that shit and then they come

2123
01:23:31,271 --> 01:23:35,860
harder
and the girl was like,

2124
01:23:35,861 --> 01:23:37,900
why don't you come so quick?
I was look at my feet.

2125
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:40,120
What?
They'll probably bomber out.

2126
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:43,910
We're trying to uplift my balls and I
came like a wildcat.

2127
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:46,120
Wow.
Heads.

2128
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,860
They just get a bunch of dogs around and
lick your feet.

2129
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:49,350
Sure.
People are doing that.

2130
01:23:49,351 --> 01:23:51,700
I mean that has been always been the old
thing about peanut butter,

2131
01:23:51,701 --> 01:23:52,660
peanut butter,
peanut butter,

2132
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:54,940
peanut peanut butter on your pussy and
dogs,

2133
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:57,280
peanut butter,
your ball sack dogs looking up the

2134
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:59,110
peanut butter.
I mean like come on,

2135
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:02,890
you have to be so fucking,
you have to be so out of options to make

2136
01:24:02,891 --> 01:24:05,390
your dog lick your ass,
lick your nuts and your asshole.

2137
01:24:07,150 --> 01:24:10,510
Just go hire a human hiring human.
It's a lot of people that are really

2138
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:12,070
desperate,
you know,

2139
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:15,190
like you think about it,
the human touch like touch from person

2140
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:19,660
is mandatory like people need it is a
requirement like vitamin C and it's just

2141
01:24:19,661 --> 01:24:22,450
a requirement that your body needs.
But there's a lot of people that just

2142
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:23,710
don't get it.
I know,

2143
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,130
I never knew how were,
how much of a requirement was until when

2144
01:24:27,131 --> 01:24:29,890
I first moved to La.
When I first moved to La,

2145
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,630
uh,
I moved from La,

2146
01:24:31,810 --> 01:24:34,390
from New York to La.
Didn't know anyone out here didn't have

2147
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:35,224
any friends.

2148
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:39,340
And I was on this set and uh,
I'm doing this TV show and I was there

2149
01:24:39,341 --> 01:24:43,570
for like a couple of weeks and I guess I
hadn't hugged anybody or done,

2150
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,860
touched anybody in a couple of weeks.
And this girl and set gave me a hug,

2151
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,740
just gave me a hug and it was like,
oh.

2152
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:53,950
It was like I got filled up with like
affection and love.

2153
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,780
Ah,
that's just real.

2154
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,250
But it was,
it was the weirdest,

2155
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,620
like I had never experienced that before
because,

2156
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:01,720
you know,
I always had a girlfriend or always had

2157
01:25:01,721 --> 01:25:04,480
friends that it was always some sort of
physical contact.

2158
01:25:04,481 --> 01:25:05,740
Right.
But out here you were alone.

2159
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:07,840
I was alone.
And then when this girl hugged me,

2160
01:25:07,841 --> 01:25:10,060
I was like,
and I remember never forgetting and I'm

2161
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:10,391
like,
wow,

2162
01:25:10,391 --> 01:25:11,910
that was a weird moment.
Like that's a,

2163
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,210
that's a physical requirement.
Like when that girl hugged me,

2164
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,620
my body was like,
yes,

2165
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:18,360
this is what we need.

2166
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,150
It like,
Whoa,

2167
01:25:19,150 --> 01:25:21,040
like when you're thirsty and you get a
glass of water,

2168
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:21,940
you're like,
ah.

2169
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:25,420
That's what it was like when she hugged
me and it wasn't even the sexual thing.

2170
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,860
It was just a human affection.
Yeah.

2171
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:29,710
Well that's why.
That's why they say kids that don't get

2172
01:25:29,711 --> 01:25:30,940
touched when they're young get like
that.

2173
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:33,670
Don't get hugged or any affection that
grew up so fucked up mentally.

2174
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,530
It the part of your brain doesn't
develop that,

2175
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:36,700
that,
that meeting,

2176
01:25:36,701 --> 01:25:39,640
that chemical react cause the transfer
of chemicals skin to skin.

2177
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,740
That's like such a big deal for the
development of your brain.

2178
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:43,990
So when kids don't get it,
it fucking ruins then.

2179
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,920
Yeah.
They say that about babies and

2180
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:48,640
orphanages.
The babies in orphanages,

2181
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:49,503
they don't get,
they don't get it.

2182
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:52,750
They die.
They can literally die from not being

2183
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:53,710
held.
That's a trip.

2184
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:56,680
Meanwhile,
animals just fucking put their kids out

2185
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:58,180
in like,
go get the fuck outta here.

2186
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:01,870
Get the kick them out of their nest.
The the fuck face learning to fly.

2187
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:05,810
He ever seen those birds that fall off
cliffs who showed us that was at

2188
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:08,390
sturgeon now I think I did.
I think it was last time I was here.

2189
01:26:08,391 --> 01:26:09,500
I think it was you.
Yeah.

2190
01:26:09,501 --> 01:26:11,960
The birds that fall just to see if they
can stay alive.

2191
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:14,930
The rocks and half of them die.
Before I came on,

2192
01:26:14,931 --> 01:26:16,040
I saw that class.
Right.

2193
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:19,430
That was fucked up.
This is a lot of like dark shit in the,

2194
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:23,030
in the animal community.
You think about the survival of these

2195
01:26:23,031 --> 01:26:24,560
little beasts.
Absurd.

2196
01:26:24,620 --> 01:26:29,330
I was just reading about how many deer
every year freeze to death in Idaho.

2197
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:31,520
Don't ask me why,
but that was,

2198
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:33,500
I was reading,
it's thousands.

2199
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:36,740
It's like sometimes these,
they'd lose thousands of animals.

2200
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:38,810
Even tried to migrate somewhere else
that you may have made up.

2201
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,360
Those numbers might be hundreds.
It's like six.

2202
01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:42,860
It's a lot.
That's a lot.

2203
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:45,590
They call it winter kill and when they
have a hard winter,

2204
01:26:45,591 --> 01:26:49,100
like a real hard winter and it was
hundreds and hundreds animals this dead

2205
01:26:49,101 --> 01:26:52,670
frozen to death.
Like imagine living in a place where you

2206
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:55,130
barely make it.
Like cryogenics right?

2207
01:26:55,131 --> 01:26:57,740
When you go to crowd healthcare in,
your legs are shaking and you get out of

2208
01:26:57,741 --> 01:27:00,800
there at three minutes and 40 seconds to
someone stays in there to six and they

2209
01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:02,990
just become an ice cube.
That's fucking insane.

2210
01:27:02,991 --> 01:27:04,280
That's what you live.
You don't have a house,

2211
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:06,680
your stupid fucking deer wandering
around through the woods.

2212
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:08,030
That's it.
That's your life to get eaten.

2213
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,620
That's like back in,
back in the Midwest.

2214
01:27:09,750 --> 01:27:11,630
Uh,
they would send out those flyers all the

2215
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:14,900
time for a registered gun owners to go
hunt.

2216
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,410
Cause the overpopulation of the deer,
it was so bad that they would die or

2217
01:27:18,411 --> 01:27:19,940
that they would try to eat each other,
which is crazy.

2218
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,690
It's turning the cannibals.
But yeah,

2219
01:27:21,691 --> 01:27:22,890
cause there wasn't a food,
you know,

2220
01:27:22,891 --> 01:27:25,810
so there was overpopulation.
It wasn't a food down enough landmass.

2221
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:29,120
They would try to eat each other.
Christ.

2222
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:30,950
I'd never heard of that.
But they'd get,

2223
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:32,450
they'd get a,
they'd pay,

2224
01:27:32,451 --> 01:27:33,284
they would,
you know,

2225
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,080
they would give you incentive to go to
go hunt if you were,

2226
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,030
you know,
a hunter to go take care of some of the

2227
01:27:38,031 --> 01:27:39,560
deer.
Well there's two options.

2228
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:41,630
Either you hunt them or you bring in
something else.

2229
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:44,000
That anthem,
that second option is always a bigger

2230
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:45,230
problem.
Way bigger problem.

2231
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:47,390
Then you change the change,
the whole makeup of it.

2232
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:48,070
Yeah.
Well,

2233
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:50,840
California is kind of done that.
California has done a weird thing

2234
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:54,530
because every other state manages their
Predator population.

2235
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:57,830
California,
you can bear hunt in California,

2236
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:00,260
but you can't do it in any effective
way.

2237
01:28:00,410 --> 01:28:03,380
What that means is like there's two ways
that are really effective ways to hunt

2238
01:28:03,381 --> 01:28:05,300
bears.
One is over bait,

2239
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:10,250
so you would like leave some food down
and you'd wait in like a blind and hide

2240
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:13,820
in the bear would come to get the food
because otherwise the places where bears

2241
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:15,290
live,
they don't live in a open country.

2242
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:20,060
They hide and they smell everything.
They smell you miles away,

2243
01:28:20,061 --> 01:28:24,050
like literally miles away.
If the wind is at your back and the wind

2244
01:28:24,051 --> 01:28:26,720
blows across a valley in a is two miles
away,

2245
01:28:26,721 --> 01:28:29,440
he'll go like,
he'll know you there.

2246
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,450
And that's not even a joke.
I mean it's a different kind of thing.

2247
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,030
And then on top of that,
the here way better than you can

2248
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:36,800
imagine.
And they see pretty good too.

2249
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,920
So you're fucked.
Like you're not going to find right.

2250
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,720
So they have a bear,
they'd have bear hunting and California,

2251
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:44,600
but it's very ineffective.
Like most people don't,

2252
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:46,070
don't,
you can't put bait,

2253
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:48,920
I mean it was just had to be
circumstance that you found.

2254
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:51,140
Yeah.
The only other place is where,

2255
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:53,690
um,
you can hunt bears effectively and it's

2256
01:28:53,691 --> 01:28:58,691
not over bait are areas where there's
like wide open spaces or um,

2257
01:28:58,820 --> 01:29:02,010
these cut blocks would,
a cut block is where a lumber

2258
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:06,480
company comes in and chops down trees
and then these little roots grow up and

2259
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:09,480
he's little tiny saplings and stuff.
And the bears like to come in and eat

2260
01:29:09,481 --> 01:29:11,160
those.
And meadows like peep.

2261
01:29:11,161 --> 01:29:13,890
So people go to meadows and occasionally
you'll spot a bear there,

2262
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:19,370
but the does its Predator control.
And then the other thing is I'm with

2263
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:22,260
dogs.
The dog one is very problematic because

2264
01:29:22,261 --> 01:29:23,940
people don't like that.
Look,

2265
01:29:23,941 --> 01:29:27,630
the idea of dogs bang up a bear,
a tree and then you shoot it out of a

2266
01:29:27,631 --> 01:29:29,130
tree.
It just seems really fucked up.

2267
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,600
Right.
That makes sense to me.

2268
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:33,090
Um,
the mount line one is another one.

2269
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:36,950
Like they stopped all mountain lion
hunting in this state and I just

2270
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,970
decided,
no,

2271
01:29:38,250 --> 01:29:39,240
no,
not going extinct.

2272
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,890
Now,
this is a lot of mountain lions.

2273
01:29:40,930 --> 01:29:42,210
Why they,
why they want to get rid of it?

2274
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:44,970
It's a political thing.
Same thing is a,

2275
01:29:44,971 --> 01:29:49,290
there's a grizzly bear ban in British
Columbia that you can't hunt grizzly

2276
01:29:49,291 --> 01:29:52,090
bears in British Columbia,
but they have a lot of grizzly bears.

2277
01:29:52,091 --> 01:29:53,670
It's like it's a real problem,
but it was,

2278
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:57,270
there was a ban that was put together by
animal rights activists and then signed

2279
01:29:57,271 --> 01:29:59,250
by,
it was really just a few thousand people

2280
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:03,930
that took like an email poll and then
they pass this 75% of them and now now

2281
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,480
they're going to have a real problem
with grizzly bears because the people

2282
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:08,810
that passed this,
they all live in Vancouver.

2283
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,150
Vancouver is beautiful.
It's,

2284
01:30:10,151 --> 01:30:13,440
it's a city metro area.
There's no grizzly bears,

2285
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,810
but those other people that live like
north,

2286
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:19,740
you go like four hours past Vancouver
and these people live in the forest.

2287
01:30:20,100 --> 01:30:25,100
They have giant 10 foot monsters that
eat cows that live in their fucking

2288
01:30:25,231 --> 01:30:26,880
woods.
And you just said,

2289
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:29,040
you just made it illegal to shoot the
monsters.

2290
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,450
Right.
And you don't even live around the

2291
01:30:30,451 --> 01:30:31,860
monsters.
You don't even know what the fuck you're

2292
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:33,090
doing.
You're in a high rise.

2293
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,310
Also,
where those people live,

2294
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,200
you can shoot as many wolves as you
want,

2295
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:39,660
so it's gotten so bad up there with
wolves.

2296
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:42,810
You could shoot a hundred wolves a day
and every day we need,

2297
01:30:42,811 --> 01:30:44,560
the more they want you to give you money
for it,

2298
01:30:44,561 --> 01:30:47,820
and some cases get up and shoot Wolfe's.
Holy Shit.

2299
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:50,940
Let's go shoot some fucking Wolfe's.
Dude.

2300
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:53,190
I don't want to be around wolves that
need to be shot.

2301
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:55,500
I want to be,
or I want to be around wolves where

2302
01:30:55,501 --> 01:30:57,780
there's a healthy population where I
don't have to do anything.

2303
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,140
Right.
The last thing you want to do is be

2304
01:30:59,141 --> 01:31:00,690
around wolves where there's so many
wolves,

2305
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:03,290
they have to shoot him.
That's when shit gets sketch.

2306
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:04,820
Yeah.
That's when it gets,

2307
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:05,940
when they come after you,
that's,

2308
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:06,120
yeah.

2309
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,460
That's when there's a fucked up.
There's a balance.

2310
01:31:08,490 --> 01:31:12,120
There's an issue and that that's what
happens if everybody's like,

2311
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:12,661
well,
leave.

2312
01:31:12,661 --> 01:31:14,700
Landon was Lou and they control their
own population.

2313
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,020
Yes,
you're correct,

2314
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:19,230
but it'll take 30 years.
Are you willing to see this

2315
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:22,710
overpopulation of grizzly pairs
attacking wildlife,

2316
01:31:22,711 --> 01:31:25,380
attacking people,
attacking dogs,

2317
01:31:25,381 --> 01:31:27,510
and breaking into people's houses
because that will happen.

2318
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:29,820
And will we include coaching in their
land?

2319
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:31,710
Sort of.
But guess what?

2320
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:35,220
If they find out where our food is there
going to encroach into land tissue like

2321
01:31:35,221 --> 01:31:37,800
there's no do we have no land and just
give up.

2322
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:39,390
Give up your house,
man.

2323
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,200
You know,
what is this like?

2324
01:31:41,201 --> 01:31:44,730
What are you doing when people don't
have a realistic idea of what animal

2325
01:31:44,731 --> 01:31:46,680
life is like?
Animal Life is beautiful,

2326
01:31:46,681 --> 01:31:50,910
but it's also life with its own ideas
about survival and what he wants to do.

2327
01:31:50,911 --> 01:31:53,700
And if you don't manage the predators,
you're not going to have the other

2328
01:31:53,701 --> 01:31:55,070
animals.
You're not going to have the deer.

2329
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:56,280
You're not going to have the moves.
Totally.

2330
01:31:56,380 --> 01:31:59,110
You've got to manage everything and
biologists know how to do it.

2331
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,070
But then we get

2332
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:00,701
involved.
Like,

2333
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:03,630
man,
I just do want to see the barest dime

2334
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:06,010
man.
People were talking about bringing bears

2335
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:07,600
back to California.
It's crazy.

2336
01:32:07,601 --> 01:32:08,980
Fucking shipping him.
Embarrass.

2337
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:09,761
Yes,
ship.

2338
01:32:09,761 --> 01:32:10,910
Amen.
Well,

2339
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,460
we have a grizzly bear on our state.
Flag.

2340
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,480
Yeah,
no,

2341
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,780
but the last grizzly bear was shot and
killed in Lubbock,

2342
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,910
California.
There's a city,

2343
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:20,400
well,
I don't know if it was kids that like

2344
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:21,670
back up north.
Yeah,

2345
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:25,380
like near Bakersfield on the way to
Bakersfield and it was a,

2346
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,400
I think the dude's name was steven the
back.

2347
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:28,550
See if you could find a l.
E,

2348
01:32:28,551 --> 01:32:31,180
b,
e c I believe he was the last man in

2349
01:32:31,181 --> 01:32:34,060
California to be killed by a grizzly
bear and they want it.

2350
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:36,100
That's a wrap there.
Peter.

2351
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:40,300
Lubeck,
Peter Lubbock and killed by aspects

2352
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:41,740
bear.
What is that?

2353
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:46,800
What it says x bear?
I think a x bear by x bear.

2354
01:32:46,840 --> 01:32:51,160
I think that's like a space that's like
a cross like well site because it's not

2355
01:32:51,161 --> 01:32:54,280
totally an ex.
October 17th,

2356
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,420
1837 wow.
October 17th,

2357
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:02,290
1837 and that's when they just went hog
and just killed all the bears.

2358
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:06,010
They had a huge bears in California too.
They were like coastal brown bears,

2359
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:09,520
like the kind they have in Alaska.
Those enormous ones you see like they

2360
01:33:09,521 --> 01:33:11,530
look like buses.
That's what they had here.

2361
01:33:11,860 --> 01:33:13,240
What are the,
what was it Kodiak?

2362
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,530
Kodiak,
Kodiak?

2363
01:33:14,531 --> 01:33:16,060
Yeah.
That's a weird place.

2364
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:19,160
What does this,
the Mr Peter Lubbock and the x bear.

2365
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:21,460
Oh,
so it was the did call it the x bear.

2366
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:24,190
I wonder why they call it the x bear.
Okay.

2367
01:33:24,191 --> 01:33:28,210
So it was a out in Lubbock,
cause it's now it says it's now fort to

2368
01:33:28,211 --> 01:33:31,120
hone where's the four off of the,
uh,

2369
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,290
off of the five.
It was at the time it says just the

2370
01:33:35,291 --> 01:33:40,030
wiles of the tach p mountains,
which by the way is the exact same area

2371
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:41,350
from their worldly blood.

2372
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:44,230
Where a Daniel Day Lewis,
that movie there will be blood.

2373
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:44,890
Yeah.
That's the,

2374
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:46,720
that's where they scored oil.
That's right.

2375
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:48,400
It's out in that area.
Is that him right there?

2376
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:50,920
That's his homeboy homeboy that got
jacked.

2377
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:52,070
No,
that's,

2378
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:54,070
that's,
that's to turn it Robert Williams.

2379
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:59,080
And what does Williamson leading a
government expedition and pass through

2380
01:33:59,081 --> 01:34:04,081
Santa Clarita in 1853 as a part of an
effort to find a practical route for a

2381
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:06,940
transcontinental railroad.
And then,

2382
01:34:06,990 --> 01:34:11,200
and then they found bears 1853 he noted
an unusually large number of grizzly

2383
01:34:11,201 --> 01:34:14,710
bears in the area.
There's a lot of pair share.

2384
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:16,300
Oh boy.
Okay.

2385
01:34:16,301 --> 01:34:17,011
Well hold on.
Sub Sub.

2386
01:34:17,011 --> 01:34:17,530
Sub Sub.
Sub.

2387
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:20,920
Scroll down.
It says party left by Fitzgerald beal,

2388
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,780
Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald,
Bill Commissioner,

2389
01:34:22,781 --> 01:34:27,781
the Indian affairs at the time found the
Lubeck tree a tree in 1854 okay,

2390
01:34:28,541 --> 01:34:32,050
so it's a tree where the,
they like had something that they left

2391
01:34:32,140 --> 01:34:35,140
to market.
This is by 1890 the tree bark had grown

2392
01:34:35,141 --> 01:34:37,510
over and cover the Lubeck inscription.
Yeah,

2393
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:40,230
so there was a,
there was a tree that was wine that like

2394
01:34:40,270 --> 01:34:43,030
had written on it.
This is the where the body was remained

2395
01:34:43,180 --> 01:34:47,020
the remains of a man approximately six
feet tall who was missing his right

2396
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:49,720
forearm,
both feet and his left hand along with

2397
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:52,960
two broken ribs and left side.
All consistent with a gruesome bear

2398
01:34:52,961 --> 01:34:54,130
attack.
Yeah,

2399
01:34:54,131 --> 01:34:56,590
baby [inaudible].

2400
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:00,410
So that's what they did when they had
these bears in California.

2401
01:35:00,411 --> 01:35:02,720
They were just jacking people.
So they killed them all.

2402
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:06,500
Like they literally have no bears left.
Not just in California,

2403
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:08,690
but there's brown bears.
But no,

2404
01:35:08,691 --> 01:35:10,790
no grizzly bears.
Brown bears are much smaller.

2405
01:35:10,791 --> 01:35:12,770
Bare.
There's not only are they not in

2406
01:35:12,771 --> 01:35:14,570
California,
like I don't even think they're close to

2407
01:35:14,571 --> 01:35:18,890
California kid hair along its back and
shoulders appeared to form an ex.

2408
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,010
Uh,
it's a common exper what,

2409
01:35:22,150 --> 01:35:23,950
where's,
where's all the grizzlies and the candor

2410
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:24,860
all north?
Yeah.

2411
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:27,800
You got to go to like,
I think if I'm correct,

2412
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:31,400
I don't think you can find them until
you get to like British Columbia.

2413
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:33,890
I don't think they're even in Washington
state.

2414
01:35:34,610 --> 01:35:38,330
I think they have them in Idaho.
They have them in Wyoming.

2415
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,700
They're starting to find them in
Colorado.

2416
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:42,410
In fact,
my friend Adam Green tree,

2417
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:47,411
the guy was shot that bull up there,
that giant buffalo water buffalo and the

2418
01:35:47,511 --> 01:35:52,511
top of the flag,
that dude for spotted and filmed them

2419
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,460
in,
I think the San Juan Mountains.

2420
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:58,310
I think that's where it is.
I think that's the name of the range in

2421
01:35:58,311 --> 01:36:00,290
Colorado where people are saying there's
no grizzly bears.

2422
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:02,210
But he found one hit a video of it.
He's like,

2423
01:36:02,211 --> 01:36:05,480
that is all fucking grizzly bear because
he's from Australia.

2424
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:07,220
Fuck King.
That's how he talks.

2425
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,270
Which state has the most grizzly bears?
Um,

2426
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:16,271
600 more live of 1500 left in the lower
48 states that you have about 800 live

2427
01:36:17,061 --> 01:36:20,150
in Montana.
She say they gotta be up there 600 more

2428
01:36:20,151 --> 01:36:22,730
live in Wyoming.
He had left and there's an estimated 70

2429
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:25,310
a hundred living in northern and eastern
Idaho.

2430
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:26,390
Okay.
So I was right.

2431
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,580
And two of them in Texas for some
reason,

2432
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:31,280
but they're in a,
they're in Colorado now.

2433
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,830
Adam is right a guarantees,
right?

2434
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:37,580
Because first of all,
Colorado borders Wyoming and it borders

2435
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:39,470
a lot of what that area is like.

2436
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:39,811
What,
what,

2437
01:36:39,811 --> 01:36:42,740
what's on the edges of Colorado.
I know Wyoming's on one side,

2438
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:45,080
I guarantee you they've crossed in
because,

2439
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,580
well,
Utah Biologists or they're questioning

2440
01:36:47,581 --> 01:36:48,740
this,
the validity of this.

2441
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:51,830
But Adam has been around bears.
Not only is he been around bears,

2442
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:55,610
he's filmed himself getting charged with
bears while he's holding up a pistol and

2443
01:36:55,611 --> 01:36:59,810
put it on instagram.
He was on a 28 day back country hunt in

2444
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:01,250
a,
so what do we got here?

2445
01:37:01,251 --> 01:37:03,620
Colorado.
What's off to the left as Utah,

2446
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:04,730
Utah,
one side,

2447
01:37:04,731 --> 01:37:06,620
there's no bearing on the top.
Yeah.

2448
01:37:06,621 --> 01:37:09,650
So they come down from the top man.
Guarantee you.

2449
01:37:09,651 --> 01:37:11,210
Yeah,
Fort Collins is right there.

2450
01:37:11,211 --> 01:37:13,130
I guarantee you there's some grizzly
bears there.

2451
01:37:13,190 --> 01:37:14,540
Adam knows.
The point is,

2452
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:17,660
this is not like a like me,
if I went into the woods and other dude

2453
01:37:17,670 --> 01:37:18,470
is,
oh grizzly bear,

2454
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:19,303
don't listen to me.

2455
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:20,690
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about.

2456
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:22,430
He,
he knows,

2457
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:25,850
he knows.
He's sure he can see one.

2458
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,310
You know a mile away.
Look at it through a spotting scope and

2459
01:37:28,311 --> 01:37:29,450
say,
that is a grizzly bear,

2460
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,590
right where I can't.
I go,

2461
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:32,510
it's a fucking bear.
It's big ass to pick.

2462
01:37:32,511 --> 01:37:35,060
There might be a big brown bear,
but he was positive.

2463
01:37:35,061 --> 01:37:38,180
It was a grizzly bear.
He said about big fucking Grizzly,

2464
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:41,060
Ken Baisley.
But people have other people spotted

2465
01:37:41,061 --> 01:37:42,530
them too.
And people have called bullshit on him,

2466
01:37:42,531 --> 01:37:44,660
but there he is right there.
This is him.

2467
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:48,620
Hold up the pistol and you see bite by
that tree to the left of that train.

2468
01:37:48,650 --> 01:37:50,360
The fog in the distance.
That's a fucking bear.

2469
01:37:50,361 --> 01:37:51,470
Standing at a time.
Legs.

2470
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:53,090
Watch this.
See it.

2471
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,920
See it standing in the fuck you.
Indeed.

2472
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,780
The thing rushed him three or four
times.

2473
01:37:57,900 --> 01:38:02,040
Now here's where it gets crazy.
He had a gun but the gun had the wrong

2474
01:38:02,041 --> 01:38:06,150
size bullets and he didn't even know it,
but it was jammed.

2475
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:10,200
So even though he thinks that he would
be able to shoot that bear,

2476
01:38:10,350 --> 01:38:13,260
he really wouldn't be able to because
the bullet isn't even in the fucking

2477
01:38:13,261 --> 01:38:15,090
chamber.
Look at that 300,

2478
01:38:15,091 --> 01:38:20,091
4,000 views.
I think that was in uh,

2479
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:22,680
believe that was an Idaho.
No.

2480
01:38:22,681 --> 01:38:25,620
Youdo you think that was an,
I know that's where he was.

2481
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,210
And then here's the other big thing.
You shoot that fucking thing and you

2482
01:38:30,211 --> 01:38:33,090
know you're in real big trouble.
You have to prove that that thing was

2483
01:38:33,091 --> 01:38:34,590
trying to kill you.
If you had video,

2484
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:36,060
that's fucking amazing.
Yeah,

2485
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,310
he did this.
One of the reasons why I filmed it,

2486
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:40,110
to let it,
cause he had been charged,

2487
01:38:40,111 --> 01:38:41,430
bluff charged a few times.

2488
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:45,180
I'd run up to within stop.
It's always a woman with her babies.

2489
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:46,500
Like she's just trying to,
and a woman,

2490
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:49,710
female bear with their babies.
She's trying to protect these bitches.

2491
01:38:49,711 --> 01:38:54,711
Are Bears fucking charging me and said,
mama trying to protect her cubs.

2492
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:58,620
I get it that the dudes don't do that.
They won't charge now.

2493
01:38:58,621 --> 01:39:00,240
They just hate you.
They'll fuck you up.

2494
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:01,830
Yeah.
If a dude is charging you,

2495
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:04,230
you're fucked.
Really hungry.

2496
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,170
Just want you to go with that.
Most of the time the males are just run

2497
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:09,670
away in the less and less,
um,

2498
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:12,780
you kill something and then it decides
to take it from you.

2499
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:15,120
Like if you kill a deer and it's wants
it,

2500
01:39:15,150 --> 01:39:16,620
yep.
You better let it fucking have it.

2501
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,810
You have to fuck off.
Well,

2502
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:21,870
in certain places you have to like,
you're not even allowed to scare them

2503
01:39:21,871 --> 01:39:23,610
off,
I think.

2504
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,380
I mean,
I would let them dates.

2505
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:29,550
There's some states it might be Montana.
No,

2506
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:31,440
there's some,
it might be Wyoming,

2507
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:35,130
Wyoming.
Maybe there's one state where once you

2508
01:39:35,131 --> 01:39:37,410
shoot something,
if it might be Idaho,

2509
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,890
it's one of those states we just keep
jumping and keep jumping.

2510
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:43,050
They could be North Dakota.
If a bear finds your your meat,

2511
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,810
you have to leave it alone.
You have to leave the bear with your

2512
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:46,680
meat.
You have to give up.

2513
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:47,431
I mean,
well,

2514
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:48,420
who?
Who's fighting that?

2515
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:50,520
Yeah.
I would let that shit go.

2516
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:53,550
Most dudes,
I bet at that bit they'll shoot that

2517
01:39:53,551 --> 01:39:55,050
thing,
shoot the bear.

2518
01:39:55,051 --> 01:39:59,130
Just because how hard it is to,
if you're on a back country hunt and

2519
01:39:59,131 --> 01:40:01,110
you,
you finally get a deer.

2520
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,330
You know how hard that is to do.
It's so hard.

2521
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:05,280
It's going to be like circle of life
type of shit where you're like,

2522
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:06,123
man,
I fucking,

2523
01:40:06,230 --> 01:40:06,540
I'm in.

2524
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,070
You know what I mean?
Boom.

2525
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:10,890
You're in their restaurant.
Boom.

2526
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:14,300
Fuck you.
Yeah.

2527
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:16,590
It's Meegan Sam.
Fuck you in the Dick.

2528
01:40:16,980 --> 01:40:19,350
I just wouldn't go to a place they
wouldn't let you scare off a prison.

2529
01:40:19,351 --> 01:40:20,790
I don't want to go to a place that has
them.

2530
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:22,081
See,
that's my shit.

2531
01:40:22,081 --> 01:40:22,771
I'm not.
No,

2532
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:23,880
thanks.
Yeah.

2533
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:26,700
I only bird on him when I was a kid
burden directly.

2534
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,380
I did dear,
but a bird hunted a lot when I was a

2535
01:40:28,381 --> 01:40:29,430
kid.
My Dad loved bird hunting.

2536
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,730
The thing about deer,
and I mean even bird hunting,

2537
01:40:32,731 --> 01:40:36,230
it's like if you're in the right place,
you could run into a wolf or a bear.

2538
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:38,910
You could if you kill a bear in
defensive license,

2539
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,670
life and property,
barris killed in defensive life and

2540
01:40:41,671 --> 01:40:43,740
property belonged to the state.
If you kill a bear,

2541
01:40:43,741 --> 01:40:46,650
you must remove the hide from the
carcass and also salvage the skull.

2542
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:49,620
By the way,
that happened to my friend Cam Haynes.

2543
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:51,840
He,
this is a crazy bears are bro.

2544
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:54,130
He shot a bear with a bow

2545
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:59,020
and Arrow killed it and then another
bear claimed the body and start a

2546
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:01,270
burring it,
this female bear.

2547
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,580
Holy Shit just decided as mine,
I'm gonna eat this.

2548
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,790
And because they cannibalize each other,
totally.

2549
01:41:05,800 --> 01:41:08,650
Hundred percent of the time,
100% of all bears are cannibals.

2550
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,470
They just all kind of one bears dead.
The other ones to start eating it,

2551
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:13,390
babies,
they start eating it.

2552
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:17,320
This is how fucked up it is.
My Buddy lives in Alberta and uh,

2553
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:22,321
his son watched a bear kill a cub and
then watched the mom eat the baby.

2554
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:24,550
Oh fuck.
That's crazy.

2555
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:27,190
Like the mom chased the,
the bear off that killed the cub and

2556
01:41:27,191 --> 01:41:28,840
then she ate it.
Yeah.

2557
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:30,400
Well cause it's dead at that point.
Was she going to do?

2558
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:34,180
But it's just what patrician yeah.
That is what it is.

2559
01:41:34,181 --> 01:41:35,680
I mean,
that's literally how they,

2560
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:36,401
I mean,
that's,

2561
01:41:36,401 --> 01:41:37,420
that's how they roll up there.

2562
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:38,670
You've never looked at your kid and been
like,

2563
01:41:38,671 --> 01:41:40,270
I ain't even fucking eat my kid.
Look good part.

2564
01:41:40,300 --> 01:41:42,170
What part would you eat first?
Uh,

2565
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:44,050
for the fat,
whatever the fattiest is.

2566
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:46,990
You know what I mean?
Just pop the legs off.

2567
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:48,760
I mean,
when you're down to that point,

2568
01:41:48,761 --> 01:41:50,380
like if you're in like one of them,
uh,

2569
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:52,150
situations like the,
like,

2570
01:41:52,390 --> 01:41:54,240
like a,
like a movie life crap.

2571
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,900
Yeah.
They crashing and he's alive.

2572
01:41:56,050 --> 01:41:58,310
Like when you start eating,
people do,

2573
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,490
do you look for the place where you jump
off first?

2574
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:02,590
Like once you get to the point where
you're like,

2575
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,780
[inaudible] get about eating each other.
I'm killing myself.

2576
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,370
Yeah.
I'll probably jumping off a cliff

2577
01:42:06,371 --> 01:42:08,030
jumping.
I'm not he unwanted.

2578
01:42:08,031 --> 01:42:08,980
You fucking people,
man.

2579
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,630
People who would walk up,
bro.

2580
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:13,900
But there's some places where you're
just not walking out.

2581
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,390
Okay.
You better get that out of your head

2582
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:18,010
because you don't have any food.

2583
01:42:18,030 --> 01:42:19,690
Yeah.
There's no water.

2584
01:42:20,530 --> 01:42:21,580
There's nothing.
Nope.

2585
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:24,670
You're not going to make it get it's a
lot at the real guys.

2586
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,850
Wow.
That's crazy.

2587
01:42:27,851 --> 01:42:28,810
It was soccer team,
right?

2588
01:42:28,870 --> 01:42:31,450
Yeah,
and so they ate dudes who died.

2589
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:33,560
Is this when they rescued him?
They took pictures of him.

2590
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:37,030
That what it is that has them going back
to the scene.

2591
01:42:37,060 --> 01:42:39,100
They look very happy.
They look happy.

2592
01:42:39,101 --> 01:42:40,360
It must,
they must have been rescued.

2593
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:42,880
That's crazy shit.
Is that the movie?

2594
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:46,090
That's the movie as the bull show is.
What's the real image?

2595
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:47,980
I asked the real image.
Wow.

2596
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:49,690
That's fucked man.
Chill.

2597
01:42:49,691 --> 01:42:51,940
Imagine how long did they live up there
for?

2598
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:54,670
72 days says,
oh Jesus,

2599
01:42:54,671 --> 01:42:57,400
that's a long time to be people.
You know.

2600
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,560
You get old too.
You'd be like this guys.

2601
01:42:59,561 --> 01:43:03,010
Fingers don't taste good and they're
eating everything frozen too.

2602
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:04,300
I don't even know if they could make
fires.

2603
01:43:04,301 --> 01:43:07,270
They're scooping like the using a spoon
to scoop your asshole out.

2604
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:12,220
What did they,
they use your bottle as a fucking bowl.

2605
01:43:12,221 --> 01:43:13,720
They're just putting stuff in your
bottle as a bolt.

2606
01:43:13,940 --> 01:43:17,220
They figured out fire like how to make a
fire up there or what would they do?

2607
01:43:17,410 --> 01:43:19,060
I think they did.
What would they even burn?

2608
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:20,710
Middle of.
Oh Wow,

2609
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:23,980
this is a real bodies now you keep
showing us pictures of the movie,

2610
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,440
but what would they burn?
They burn whatever's inside that plane

2611
01:43:26,441 --> 01:43:27,750
leftover like clothes,
shirts.

2612
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:30,550
That would go quick.
You've got to find some woods.

2613
01:43:30,590 --> 01:43:32,620
You've got to find some trees.
There's nothing up there.

2614
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:34,960
If they're way above the timberline.
Yeah.

2615
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:37,540
And probably a bunch of people broken up
there.

2616
01:43:37,541 --> 01:43:40,870
Probably a bad backs and fucked up while
they're all fucked up on the accident

2617
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:43,180
that she,
I remember that movie was so fucked up.

2618
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:47,080
It's a,
it's a terrifying thing.

2619
01:43:47,330 --> 01:43:50,740
Well,
thousand feet altitude to wait 12,000,

2620
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:52,640
11,008.
That's like literally

2621
01:43:52,670 --> 01:43:53,840
just above the tail or no,
no,

2622
01:43:53,841 --> 01:43:55,280
no,
no.

2623
01:43:55,281 --> 01:43:57,010
Timberline is like 13,
five or something.

2624
01:43:57,050 --> 01:43:59,540
You know what they give you when you
have altitude sickness and you're at

2625
01:43:59,541 --> 01:44:01,040
that height?
Cialis.

2626
01:44:01,810 --> 01:44:03,200
So boner pills,
boner pills.

2627
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:04,900
They want to get hard,
so you just don't get it.

2628
01:44:04,901 --> 01:44:06,310
Models,
boner pills.

2629
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:08,600
They give you a bottle of skiing down
the hill,

2630
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:12,530
which is a fucking hard dick.
The,

2631
01:44:12,531 --> 01:44:15,230
um,
what those things do is dilate.

2632
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:19,850
They dilate your muscles and apparently
that helps you breathe easier when

2633
01:44:19,851 --> 01:44:22,610
you're at high altitude it.
Well it definitely does because they

2634
01:44:22,611 --> 01:44:24,350
have like we go to breckenridge every
year,

2635
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:29,350
we have family up there and uh,
we sleep there house is uh,

2636
01:44:29,430 --> 01:44:32,030
you know,
halfway up the side mountain we sleep at

2637
01:44:32,031 --> 01:44:33,920
about 11 to 11,000,
200 feet.

2638
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,850
That's,
that takes a while to adapt to not easy.

2639
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:39,680
Well if we go to Denver for three or
four days,

2640
01:44:39,681 --> 01:44:42,200
but three days beforehand you get it a
little easier,

2641
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,640
you get a little bump easier.

2642
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:48,260
But I'm not,
what else is not just there's,

2643
01:44:48,410 --> 01:44:51,260
there's another one that's just that
almost the same kind of a breakfast,

2644
01:44:51,261 --> 01:44:52,280
one of the highest out there.
But yeah,

2645
01:44:52,281 --> 01:44:55,240
we sleep at like 11 to like 10.
It's like anywhere from 10,

2646
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:56,083
10,
seven right out,

2647
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:58,010
right near like near the house and then
till like 11,

2648
01:44:58,011 --> 01:45:01,040
two is where it usually ends up cause
I've got my altimeter on my phone.

2649
01:45:01,041 --> 01:45:02,000
I'm always like,
I wonder how high.

2650
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:03,350
Yeah,
I use one of those two.

2651
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:06,260
I just want to,
I was like no one and doesn't have work.

2652
01:45:06,261 --> 01:45:07,700
Even if you don't have service.
Yeah.

2653
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:08,870
How's that work?
Well,

2654
01:45:08,871 --> 01:45:11,870
do the things are still sending data
even if you don't have service GPS?

2655
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:12,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

2656
01:45:12,801 --> 01:45:14,780
We've just accepted that the
government's tracking us.

2657
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:15,710
Right.
I'm fine with it.

2658
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:16,491
We'll do it.
When this thing,

2659
01:45:16,491 --> 01:45:18,530
when I first got to Japan,
the first thing that I did,

2660
01:45:18,531 --> 01:45:19,364
I was like,
hello?

2661
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,610
Yeah.
It flips over and it tells you exactly

2662
01:45:22,611 --> 01:45:24,800
where you are without,
there was no service on it.

2663
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:26,740
It was like poop pinpoint that Google
maps was like,

2664
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:27,783
oop,
you're right there.

2665
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:28,970
Whoa.
This is a trip,

2666
01:45:28,971 --> 01:45:31,130
dude.
It's never not sending and receiving

2667
01:45:31,131 --> 01:45:31,964
data.
Right.

2668
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:34,520
Constantly been on airplane mode.
Still sending and receiving data.

2669
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:36,770
Well,
I knew this lady used to work for CNN

2670
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:38,610
and when she would go to places,
um,

2671
01:45:38,660 --> 01:45:40,280
if they,
if you had an iphone,

2672
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:42,140
like she would go to these Middle
Eastern places.

2673
01:45:42,141 --> 01:45:43,670
Do they have to talk to people and
interview them?

2674
01:45:43,850 --> 01:45:45,530
They would take your phone away if you
had an iphone,

2675
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:47,640
if you had an android phone,
they take the battery out.

2676
01:45:47,641 --> 01:45:48,860
And the olden days.
Right.

2677
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:50,450
But if you had an iphone,
they just say,

2678
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:51,980
no,
we're taking that phone shit.

2679
01:45:52,010 --> 01:45:54,680
You're being tracked and listened to
100% period.

2680
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,580
You're in some fucking bow rain place.
Some weird fucking,

2681
01:45:58,581 --> 01:46:00,170
they take away your eye,
go with your phone.

2682
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:01,970
That's what she would meet with these
people.

2683
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:03,530
Do you do that at shows?
By the way,

2684
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:06,440
do you take away,
do you do now you do the pouch thing,

2685
01:46:06,470 --> 01:46:08,510
the yonder patches,
patches rather.

2686
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:11,120
It's a great idea.
I've heard changes the game.

2687
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:14,240
It changes the show.
It's like first of all you could always,

2688
01:46:14,270 --> 01:46:16,550
if you have important phone calls I have
to do is just leave the room.

2689
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:18,890
The phone will ring,
you leave the room,

2690
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:21,110
you open the pouch.
Once you get out of the room and you can

2691
01:46:21,111 --> 01:46:22,520
come back in and put it back in the
pouch,

2692
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:23,560
you come back in.
So we did.

2693
01:46:23,561 --> 01:46:25,610
Touches are not with them that their
stretches with you.

2694
01:46:25,670 --> 01:46:27,130
Oh you saved the pocs.
They have the key.

2695
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:28,490
Yeah.
Fronts all locked up.

2696
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,840
Right.
And when you go out,

2697
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:32,090
they opened it up like people will,
I'm not giving my phone up.

2698
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:33,950
You don't have to give your phone using
your hands,

2699
01:46:34,010 --> 01:46:36,650
but you're in this pouch and when you go
out they open,

2700
01:46:36,651 --> 01:46:38,900
the pouch takes three seconds,
it opens up,

2701
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:40,400
you get the phone out.
So if you'd like,

2702
01:46:40,401 --> 01:46:44,390
say if you have a babysitter at your
house or something like that issue you

2703
01:46:44,391 --> 01:46:47,150
can check it.
But in the pouch it doesn't disable the

2704
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:48,890
phone from not getting service or
anything.

2705
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,790
See that's what I think they should
figure out.

2706
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:53,350
Well cause it's a public service to the
phone.

2707
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,200
If there was an urgency though,
see that would,

2708
01:46:55,230 --> 01:46:57,090
that would prevent,
see what the thing is that's good about

2709
01:46:57,091 --> 01:47:00,930
the pouch is that if you really like,
if there's some critical issue that you

2710
01:47:00,931 --> 01:47:03,690
think could come up,
I know your phone's ringing like okay

2711
01:47:03,691 --> 01:47:04,610
I'm going to leave the drain.

2712
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:06,870
But then it gives people incentive to
still have their phone on to ring.

2713
01:47:06,930 --> 01:47:08,370
Do you know what I mean?
That is true.

2714
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:12,540
That is true to me is saying like,
you know what's true.

2715
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:16,650
How often did the emergent,
if the show is two hours in an emergency

2716
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:18,540
happens within that gap of time of two
hours.

2717
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:20,970
Isn't that the University of Spain like
this is life.

2718
01:47:21,100 --> 01:47:22,650
The fuck the fuck.
What the fuck?

2719
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,660
You have kids that nobody wants to hear
that.

2720
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:25,291
No,
totally.

2721
01:47:25,291 --> 01:47:26,610
I get that,
but it's also like,

2722
01:47:26,611 --> 01:47:27,940
I just feel like,
you know,

2723
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:31,420
this show is so much fucking better to
way better without the phone.

2724
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:33,270
Have you done one of those shows?
No,

2725
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:35,720
you should come with me.
We'll do a do a gig together.

2726
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,410
I would love that because the idea of
it,

2727
01:47:37,411 --> 01:47:39,600
I thought when I heard it I was like,
that's the most brilliant shit I've ever

2728
01:47:39,601 --> 01:47:40,230
heard in my life.

2729
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:41,790
It's phenomenal.
I'm telling you,

2730
01:47:41,791 --> 01:47:43,920
it's phenomenal.
I think gets people mentally in a place

2731
01:47:43,921 --> 01:47:45,200
where they're like,
I'm just gonna enjoy the shelf.

2732
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:46,020
Exactly.
Yeah.

2733
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,540
I don't have to fucking think about
nonsuit.

2734
01:47:47,610 --> 01:47:49,680
Everybody's got their phone up
everywhere you go.

2735
01:47:49,681 --> 01:47:51,330
They have their phone up film and
everything.

2736
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,700
They want to film everything and want to
take pictures of everything and it's a

2737
01:47:53,701 --> 01:47:56,550
distraction.
I just went to go see the friend of a

2738
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:57,850
friend play,
you know,

2739
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:59,000
like abandoned.
Uh,

2740
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:02,210
even that like small nonsense venues,
people sell their fault.

2741
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:03,930
I'm not talking like,
you know,

2742
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,280
it's like fuck it.
And you know,

2743
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:08,610
a massively famous like Bruno Mars,
like every kid.

2744
01:48:08,611 --> 01:48:10,650
I'm sure it's like good the whole time.
Of course.

2745
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:14,010
Even like a small,
tiny little venue where I was like 80

2746
01:48:14,011 --> 01:48:17,130
people all have their phones out too.
I thought those would just be a little

2747
01:48:17,131 --> 01:48:18,030
bit more chill.

2748
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:20,490
I think it's less of an issue with
music,

2749
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,470
although some people do have an issue
with it.

2750
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:24,570
But I'm,
with music,

2751
01:48:24,900 --> 01:48:25,830
you're in,
you're the,

2752
01:48:25,831 --> 01:48:27,600
you already know the songs.
Yeah.

2753
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:30,660
Like with jokes,
like say if you're working on a new

2754
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:30,930
hour,
right?

2755
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:33,990
And you go to the laugh factory and five
people in the audience are filming you

2756
01:48:33,991 --> 01:48:35,840
and they want to put it on youtube.
Like your,

2757
01:48:35,841 --> 01:48:37,860
your jokes are half Kodaly.
You're trying,

2758
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:41,730
comedy is one of the weird art forms
because you have to practice it in front

2759
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:43,110
of other people.
Right?

2760
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:45,990
You could write it alone,
but you really don't know how it goes

2761
01:48:45,991 --> 01:48:47,670
together until you try it in front of
other people.

2762
01:48:47,671 --> 01:48:52,050
And out of all the bits that you have,
how many of them start off and they eat

2763
01:48:52,051 --> 01:48:53,370
dick?
Most?

2764
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:57,660
Almost all of them.
There's like one or two that you do that

2765
01:48:57,661 --> 01:48:58,710
you right away that hits and you're
like,

2766
01:48:58,760 --> 01:48:59,550
oh right,
fuck yeah.

2767
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:00,171
All right,
that's good.

2768
01:49:00,171 --> 01:49:03,450
From start desperately bad.
And to try to figure out how to make it

2769
01:49:03,451 --> 01:49:06,960
work somewhere.
Where the fuck is it?

2770
01:49:06,980 --> 01:49:08,820
You know?
And you're trying to convey that to

2771
01:49:08,821 --> 01:49:09,210
them.
You're like,

2772
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:10,800
trust me,
this is not your,

2773
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:13,920
you just haven't heard it yet.
It's just you'll hear it in a year,

2774
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:19,230
come back in a year,
the [inaudible] and even then like even

2775
01:49:19,231 --> 01:49:21,390
when you got something down,
like sometimes I'd take a chance with

2776
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:22,830
it,
like maybe I'm not totally done with

2777
01:49:22,831 --> 01:49:24,520
this.
We take it out on a left turn.

2778
01:49:24,550 --> 01:49:25,140
You're like,
Ooh,

2779
01:49:25,140 --> 01:49:26,250
oh,
I've talked to like stuff.

2780
01:49:26,251 --> 01:49:30,090
When I find that I tried once and I
hated it and like a year later and then

2781
01:49:30,091 --> 01:49:31,110
I tried again.
And it works.

2782
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:31,931
Yeah.
That's weird.

2783
01:49:31,931 --> 01:49:33,010
That I love.
Yeah.

2784
01:49:33,060 --> 01:49:36,090
Well you don't even know why.
Like what's wrong with me then?

2785
01:49:36,091 --> 01:49:37,080
And write with me now.

2786
01:49:37,110 --> 01:49:39,750
Something about the rhythm of the way
you even thought about it.

2787
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:43,080
Like I think sometimes when I get an
idea of a joke and the rhythm of the

2788
01:49:43,081 --> 01:49:44,370
joke,
I can't even find,

2789
01:49:44,371 --> 01:49:45,450
like I'm like,
I don't even know why.

2790
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:48,490
I just kinda liked the idea that for
some reason and then a year or two later

2791
01:49:48,491 --> 01:49:51,460
you're like,
something else usually happens that

2792
01:49:51,461 --> 01:49:54,040
goes,
that's just like when I felt blank and

2793
01:49:54,041 --> 01:49:55,540
then these things kind of like Mesh
together.

2794
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:57,160
It was just like the missing piece.
Well,

2795
01:49:57,161 --> 01:50:01,690
what's in your head is so important.
That's why Theo Vaughn so fucking funny.

2796
01:50:01,691 --> 01:50:05,710
It's my guy because Theo's act is like
so ridiculous.

2797
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:07,480
Oh,
and when you see it,

2798
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:10,630
if you saw it on paper,
there's a lot of bits that you'd see on

2799
01:50:10,631 --> 01:50:11,261
paper.
You how,

2800
01:50:11,261 --> 01:50:12,550
what does that,
that's funny.

2801
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,890
And then you see him live,
you're like,

2802
01:50:13,910 --> 01:50:15,640
ah,
it's amazing.

2803
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:18,430
In his head he knows why.
That's funny.

2804
01:50:18,490 --> 01:50:19,720
Right?
He knows why that's funny.

2805
01:50:19,721 --> 01:50:23,050
And then he tells it to you in the way
that it's going on in his head and you

2806
01:50:23,051 --> 01:50:24,600
start fucking howling.
Right.

2807
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:27,520
But like if you're not totally sure if
it's funny,

2808
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:30,280
which you usually aren't when you're
trying something out on stage,

2809
01:50:30,490 --> 01:50:32,110
they can kind of tell.
Totally.

2810
01:50:32,111 --> 01:50:36,430
You're not totally sure the money.
So if someone films that and then puts

2811
01:50:36,431 --> 01:50:38,230
it on youtube,
if that's not good,

2812
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:40,450
like say me,
maybe I'm an Andrew Santino fan and I go

2813
01:50:40,451 --> 01:50:42,360
as new bits kind of suck.
I'm like,

2814
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,710
no,
just say you haven't really seen him.

2815
01:50:44,711 --> 01:50:45,610
Yeah.
This is a,

2816
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:46,890
it's an embryo.
Yeah,

2817
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:47,551
yeah,
yeah,

2818
01:50:47,551 --> 01:50:50,140
yeah.
You saw the beginning stages of what is

2819
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:51,160
going to be,
yeah.

2820
01:50:51,161 --> 01:50:52,950
That's stuff.
That's the whole filming of,

2821
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:53,800
uh,
of,

2822
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:55,000
of shows.
And they still,

2823
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:57,370
they bus people at the store all the
time for her trying to do that.

2824
01:50:57,580 --> 01:50:59,290
But there's still people that tried to
get away with it.

2825
01:50:59,291 --> 01:51:02,890
They UCP poking up there for just fans.
Some of them are just fans.

2826
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,380
I would say most people are just a fan.
They just want to have that little

2827
01:51:05,381 --> 01:51:07,570
piece.
But I just think there's always fucking

2828
01:51:07,571 --> 01:51:09,220
people that are up to no good.
Well,

2829
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:12,530
there's always people that are just,
first of all this people that if you're

2830
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:16,210
a performer and they're not a performer,
they don't give a fuck total like

2831
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:17,560
they're not,
they're not looking out for you.

2832
01:51:17,561 --> 01:51:18,394
They say,
Hey,

2833
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,580
I'm fucking audience.
Whenever you worry about you,

2834
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:23,470
you're doing it.
I'm a fucking guy who films I've paid to

2835
01:51:23,471 --> 01:51:24,370
be here,
pal.

2836
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,320
Yeah,
that's what I do.

2837
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:28,810
All right,
and you're a performer guy,

2838
01:51:28,930 --> 01:51:33,220
so fucking perform performer.
I film this next performer guy coming to

2839
01:51:33,221 --> 01:51:34,120
the stage.
You're going to love him.

2840
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:38,320
Someone said this to sturgeon,
a sturgill simpson comes up to him in an

2841
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:41,470
airport and sticks a fucking camera in
his face when he's talking to his friend

2842
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:43,810
and his friend are talking to guys like
holding the camera.

2843
01:51:43,811 --> 01:51:44,680
He's like,
what are you doing man?

2844
01:51:44,681 --> 01:51:45,070
He was,
hey,

2845
01:51:45,070 --> 01:51:45,970
it's a price you pay,
bro.

2846
01:51:46,630 --> 01:51:49,450
Fuck what he says to them.
It's the price you pay that nothing

2847
01:51:49,451 --> 01:51:51,030
drives me more insane.
When people say Shit like that,

2848
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:54,280
the price you pay.
I just decided that's what comes along

2849
01:51:54,281 --> 01:51:55,430
with the territory.
Hey attacks,

2850
01:51:55,450 --> 01:51:59,130
bro.
Time to pay the same tax tax.

2851
01:51:59,131 --> 01:52:00,970
I stand in front of you.
When you talked to your friend,

2852
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:03,760
like in any other world that would be so
rude.

2853
01:52:03,761 --> 01:52:07,740
Like if you were just standing by
talking to your friend and both of you

2854
01:52:07,741 --> 01:52:10,810
are an insurance salesman and a guy came
up and put a phone in your face,

2855
01:52:10,811 --> 01:52:12,430
you'd be like,
what the fuck is this guy?

2856
01:52:13,040 --> 01:52:14,770
I'm insured by state farm so I get to do
this.

2857
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:16,000
It's just price.
You pay,

2858
01:52:16,001 --> 01:52:17,620
you want to be in public.
I get the film yet

2859
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:22,300
like that's a,
that's a thing that people have decided,

2860
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,460
right?
Some people in their head like this guy

2861
01:52:24,461 --> 01:52:26,950
with a camera that if you are a famous
person,

2862
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:28,930
like anything you do.
Yup,

2863
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:30,850
I'm allowed to film you everywhere you
go.

2864
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,970
I'll take pictures because he does this
because there's this big disconnect that

2865
01:52:34,110 --> 01:52:37,300
that people that are famous are people.
There's this thing that's like,

2866
01:52:37,301 --> 01:52:38,134
no,
you're ours now.

2867
01:52:38,540 --> 01:52:41,440
We we,
we made you famous so now you're ours.

2868
01:52:41,441 --> 01:52:44,380
Whatever we want from you.
That that idea is fucking crazy to me

2869
01:52:44,381 --> 01:52:45,870
that someone's like,
they're barely human.

2870
01:52:45,871 --> 01:52:47,900
Sometimes they don't treat people like
they're not human.

2871
01:52:47,901 --> 01:52:48,950
They're just,
you know,

2872
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:50,780
it was pretty good at it.
Pretty good.

2873
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:54,710
Is the TMZ guys for the most part and
they come up to with the cameras,

2874
01:52:55,070 --> 01:52:56,060
they're very good guys.

2875
01:52:56,360 --> 01:52:57,390
Like for the most part,
yeah.

2876
01:52:57,410 --> 01:52:59,450
A lot of them are actually comics.
They're like,

2877
01:52:59,451 --> 01:53:02,390
do it as a few of them.
I knew where comics that are struggling

2878
01:53:02,391 --> 01:53:05,120
and they meet people,
the airport and asking weird questions

2879
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:06,950
and shit.
Most of the time it's no big deal.

2880
01:53:06,980 --> 01:53:08,510
I'll see.
I'll go cheese or Cheddar.

2881
01:53:10,050 --> 01:53:12,180
It's one of those kids,
they have the fucking weirdest.

2882
01:53:12,190 --> 01:53:14,150
Oftentimes the questions are so like,
yeah,

2883
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:15,920
well they're just trying to get
something,

2884
01:53:16,180 --> 01:53:18,020
but that's how they're getting by,
you know?

2885
01:53:18,050 --> 01:53:19,550
Totally.
But it's just,

2886
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,210
there's almost never a good idea to
answer those questions.

2887
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:24,920
Oh,
did you look like a fucking idiot?

2888
01:53:24,921 --> 01:53:26,810
No matter what.
Like,

2889
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:28,910
oh,
someone got Anthony Bordain at the

2890
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:31,490
airport and they said,
if you were going to cook dinner for

2891
01:53:31,820 --> 01:53:34,070
Donald Trump and Kim Jong Moon,
what would you serve?

2892
01:53:34,310 --> 01:53:35,300
And he says,
hemlock.

2893
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:38,630
And then all the magma assholes went
fucking crazy.

2894
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:40,430
That's a porridge.
And he's threatening to kill the

2895
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:41,440
president.
That said,

2896
01:53:41,441 --> 01:53:45,620
someone called the finger fair with and
juvenile arrested

2897
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:50,540
fucking maggot hats,
all filled with sweat around the brim

2898
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:55,670
for anything like a foot.
His hat smells like a foot going to kill

2899
01:53:55,671 --> 01:53:59,360
the president.
Mr Mr. Secret service agent.

2900
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:04,540
I want you to rest on your birthday.
There's no joking about the pregnant.

2901
01:54:07,830 --> 01:54:09,980
Meanwhile all he does is crack jokes.
Yeah,

2902
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:13,850
I wish he really did say that.
That motherfucker line while he was

2903
01:54:13,851 --> 01:54:15,440
president.
Come on.

2904
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,780
I mean,
that shit would be hilarious if he did

2905
01:54:17,781 --> 01:54:19,370
that as president.
What would everybody do?

2906
01:54:19,371 --> 01:54:19,710
Go.
Oh,

2907
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:23,600
you're not allowed to do that.
He wrote right now the president to not

2908
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:26,300
to not cuss.
That's kind of like a,

2909
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:28,100
but I think that like when he tweeted
it,

2910
01:54:28,101 --> 01:54:29,690
Kim Jong,
who to call him little rocket man.

2911
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:31,160
That was hilarious.
So funny.

2912
01:54:31,190 --> 01:54:33,260
That was hilarious.
Just plain funny.

2913
01:54:33,290 --> 01:54:33,830
Well,
he goes,

2914
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:34,940
did you see the one tweet?
He goes,

2915
01:54:34,941 --> 01:54:37,430
I don't know why Kim Jong Moon said I
was old.

2916
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:42,580
I would never say he short and fat.
It's like a return to like comic.

2917
01:54:44,120 --> 01:54:44,840
Yeah.
As I go,

2918
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:48,290
I don't smack that did go to your work.
It's making the exact same thing.

2919
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,110
Yeah.
That's so funny.

2920
01:54:51,110 --> 01:54:53,060
But it mean the fact that he just like
this was,

2921
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:56,040
this is the president saying this fuss
funny.

2922
01:54:56,330 --> 01:54:58,160
It's fucking hilarious.
But meanwhile,

2923
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:01,010
Kim Jong Moon now wants to sign a peace
treaty.

2924
01:55:01,040 --> 01:55:02,000
They want to meet,
they're going to meet,

2925
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:04,490
they're going to meet.
Nobody wanted to meet with him before.

2926
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:05,990
Everybody's like,
just too dangerous.

2927
01:55:05,991 --> 01:55:07,670
So I never call him,
showed him fat.

2928
01:55:08,470 --> 01:55:10,700
Oh,
whenever I tried so hard to be as friend

2929
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:12,610
and maybe some day that'll happen.
Yes.

2930
01:55:12,611 --> 01:55:13,444
He,
he,

2931
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:16,370
he shits on you,
shows you the consequences if you

2932
01:55:16,371 --> 01:55:19,670
fucking with him and then he opens up.
That's kind of what we do anyway.

2933
01:55:19,671 --> 01:55:20,780
That's like what friends do that you
like?

2934
01:55:20,781 --> 01:55:22,040
You Shit on each other and then you're
like,

2935
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:22,641
dude,
I love you.

2936
01:55:22,641 --> 01:55:24,950
It's because I fucking,
maybe someday that will happen.

2937
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:28,580
Oh well I try so hard to be his friend.
This guy.

2938
01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:29,751
Come on,
man,

2939
01:55:29,751 --> 01:55:33,170
this look I'm not,
there's a lot of things this guy does

2940
01:55:33,171 --> 01:55:34,004
wrong.

2941
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:36,350
Fucking entertaining,
very entertaining.

2942
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:38,510
There's no,
never been a more entertaining

2943
01:55:38,511 --> 01:55:40,070
president.
Not even close.

2944
01:55:40,100 --> 01:55:43,440
No.
He is the fucking grand champion of

2945
01:55:43,441 --> 01:55:46,740
being an entertaining for as long as he
doesn't blow us up and he gets out

2946
01:55:46,741 --> 01:55:50,370
without getting in the box like it's,
it's highly possible.

2947
01:55:50,371 --> 01:55:51,810
That doesn't make it out of this one
alive,

2948
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:54,120
but if he does,
he gets through the whole thing.

2949
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:55,410
I think he's going to be good.
You think so?

2950
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,080
I think he'll be fine.
Let me,

2951
01:55:57,090 --> 01:56:00,380
let me say this,
the last four years or eight years and

2952
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:02,010
look at all these in.
A lot of liberals are like,

2953
01:56:02,011 --> 01:56:03,060
what?
Never.

2954
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:05,510
Never.
Whether it lasts ever trump.

2955
01:56:05,610 --> 01:56:08,490
If it lasts for eight years,
the one thing they'll that we will all

2956
01:56:08,491 --> 01:56:09,720
say,
we'll look back on.

2957
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:10,531
We'll go,
man,

2958
01:56:10,531 --> 01:56:13,620
that's crazy.
It took that thing for us to talk about.

2959
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:16,110
A lot of things like the me too movement
would have never happened.

2960
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:18,750
If Hillary got in office.
Yeah it would have.

2961
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:19,860
Sure.
I don't think so.

2962
01:56:19,861 --> 01:56:21,420
Man.
Weinstein got exposed.

2963
01:56:21,450 --> 01:56:24,200
That's the hardest one.
But I think we're,

2964
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,760
we're tumble effect of what happened
with him.

2965
01:56:26,850 --> 01:56:29,580
I agree too,
but I think it all helped in together.

2966
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:30,270
Yeah.
I,

2967
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:33,930
I'm just saying like I bet you the
harvey thing wouldn't have been so real

2968
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:37,170
and Hillary got in cause it cause all
the liberals that condemned all the

2969
01:56:37,171 --> 01:56:39,030
liberals,
like all the liberals that called out,

2970
01:56:39,031 --> 01:56:40,560
people like harvey and everyone in our
business,

2971
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:43,200
they would have been so gleeful of this
hillary thing.

2972
01:56:43,201 --> 01:56:45,180
I think that would've still been like,
ah,

2973
01:56:45,210 --> 01:56:48,130
well we'll cover it up like we've been
doing for the [inaudible].

2974
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:50,880
It's not like it just started,
it's been going on.

2975
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:53,430
Why?
Why not suppress stories before because

2976
01:56:53,431 --> 01:56:55,170
they,
they got these people to support.

2977
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:57,520
I just think the power of social media,
it's just,

2978
01:56:58,020 --> 01:56:59,640
I think the timing was perfect with
trump.

2979
01:56:59,670 --> 01:57:00,710
I think.
I'm just saying like I think,

2980
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:02,720
think so.
I think those things led to it just

2981
01:57:02,730 --> 01:57:03,690
being like,
all right,

2982
01:57:03,691 --> 01:57:04,501
that's it.
We have to do something.

2983
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:06,960
I think it was definitely a factor,
but I bet you it wouldn't happen so fast

2984
01:57:06,961 --> 01:57:08,580
with Hillary.
I bet you that would have been a longer

2985
01:57:08,581 --> 01:57:09,361
road.
Oh yeah,

2986
01:57:09,361 --> 01:57:10,170
dude.
I Dunno.

2987
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:12,300
Because liberals would have gotten
exactly what they wanted.

2988
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,420
The only way it would have been a longer
rows because Weinstein supported

2989
01:57:15,421 --> 01:57:16,800
Hillary's camp.
That's what I'm saying.

2990
01:57:16,801 --> 01:57:19,590
That is possible.
All part of the same cause there's a lot

2991
01:57:19,591 --> 01:57:22,350
of photos of them together.
Put Him with Obama,

2992
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:24,210
but he's got photos of everybody.
Yeah.

2993
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:28,560
Everybody liked him just hugging up on
all these people that call him a monster

2994
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:29,394
now.
Yeah.

2995
01:57:29,530 --> 01:57:30,810
Things out.
He's a god.

2996
01:57:30,811 --> 01:57:32,790
Like Meryl Streep Saves a God.
Yeah,

2997
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:34,930
a godsend.
It's a sod sense.

2998
01:57:34,980 --> 01:57:37,470
The same thing with trump though.
Like how many celebrities you see with

2999
01:57:37,471 --> 01:57:38,730
pictures of trump?
It's hysterical.

3000
01:57:38,910 --> 01:57:40,710
Killer.
Diehard liberals that are like,

3001
01:57:40,740 --> 01:57:42,480
they asked me to,
you have your parents buds and all that

3002
01:57:42,481 --> 01:57:44,220
shit.
They asked me to do the apprentice when

3003
01:57:44,221 --> 01:57:46,080
I was doing the second round of fear
factor.

3004
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:47,520
When you said,
no way,

3005
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:50,400
I don't want to live in New York for
three months and that's it.

3006
01:57:50,560 --> 01:57:52,860
My kid was one of my,
my youngest kid was very young.

3007
01:57:52,890 --> 01:57:55,200
Who is going to be on the show.
I don't know.

3008
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:56,620
No idea.
I would have loved to see who he

3009
01:57:56,660 --> 01:57:58,020
would've gone up with.
Dude.

3010
01:57:58,021 --> 01:58:01,020
I would've been so Dennis Rodman,
non competitive.

3011
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:03,830
I would have been high as fuck Cindy
Lopper time.

3012
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:05,250
Oh.
To try to come up with a good idea.

3013
01:58:05,251 --> 01:58:07,230
And if it didn't work,
now you have a two to one.

3014
01:58:07,231 --> 01:58:07,590
That's why.

3015
01:58:07,590 --> 01:58:08,760
Cause you didn't care.
Yeah.

3016
01:58:08,790 --> 01:58:09,870
The people that care,
that's who,

3017
01:58:09,930 --> 01:58:11,550
that's who loses.
I don't know man.

3018
01:58:11,551 --> 01:58:15,000
I cared so little that I probably would
lose.

3019
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:17,670
I think you'd win.
I probably would barely the person

3020
01:58:17,671 --> 01:58:18,271
that's like,
man,

3021
01:58:18,271 --> 01:58:18,690
I forgot.
I'm,

3022
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:21,330
don't you have to be good at business.
I'm fucking terrible at business.

3023
01:58:21,331 --> 01:58:22,830
Like what would you,
some of the people on that show,

3024
01:58:22,831 --> 01:58:23,790
they just,
they're all doing it.

3025
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:25,770
They don't know.
I mean that like who they cast on it.

3026
01:58:25,771 --> 01:58:27,150
They wing it.
It's like whoever they guess.

3027
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:30,480
I've seen literally 13 seconds of that
show and it's all clips.

3028
01:58:30,481 --> 01:58:31,314
You're fired,
you're fired,

3029
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:33,480
you're fired.
That's the best clip you're fired.

3030
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:37,460
I just,
I don't get it.

3031
01:58:38,130 --> 01:58:40,290
I just did.
Just didn't seem like a fun show.

3032
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,980
I wish she came at her

3033
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,870
fired.
I would add McDonald's with you.

3034
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,390
I don't eat that shit.
I do.

3035
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:47,130
Ali,
yours.

3036
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:49,210
He eats fried chicken with a fork and
knife.

3037
01:58:49,230 --> 01:58:49,811
Dude,
that's it.

3038
01:58:49,811 --> 01:58:50,590
This guy,
he's a cop.

3039
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:54,070
He's a comic act.
She's a comic that he is a cartoon.

3040
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:58,180
He's an odd and that's for sure.
Do you think he's gonna run again?

3041
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:01,720
100% right when he was gonna win again,
100% he's going to win again.

3042
01:59:01,721 --> 01:59:02,890
Yeah.
Wow.

3043
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,300
And I'm not saying like,
of course there's people that are

3044
01:59:04,301 --> 01:59:07,480
probably like,
fuck dude,

3045
01:59:07,510 --> 01:59:10,860
I just need to come to my boy hearts
gallery and same,

3046
01:59:10,861 --> 01:59:14,470
I never trump exhibited that was burned
to the ground by Mexicans.

3047
01:59:14,710 --> 01:59:16,720
How ironic.
Nazi coffee.

3048
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:18,790
I just think,
I think he's going to win again.

3049
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:20,710
I just do.
I think unless the Democrats can pull

3050
01:59:20,711 --> 01:59:22,060
something together in the next year and
a half,

3051
01:59:22,061 --> 01:59:24,340
two years to someone that actually is
like a formidable component.

3052
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:27,430
Well my activism is going to prevent
that.

3053
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:32,110
I just,
I just think he's going to go again.

3054
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:37,350
He might look if he's smart and he
clearly is a very clever man.

3055
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:42,070
If he's a clever man,
it's entirely possible that he's got one

3056
01:59:42,071 --> 01:59:47,071
round in the chamber for like right
around six to eight weeks out totally

3057
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:51,730
before the election.
One thing where he like let something

3058
01:59:51,731 --> 01:59:56,020
happen or shit goes down and he has the
perfect solution to put out that fire

3059
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,630
and he's good to go.
They plan that stuff,

3060
01:59:58,631 --> 02:00:00,250
man.
Absolutely.

3061
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:02,830
People working on it right now.
The moment you get into office,

3062
02:00:02,831 --> 02:00:07,831
they're trying to keep you in office and
sometimes people die and it dumps all

3063
02:00:08,040 --> 02:00:09,450
day.
Yeah.

3064
02:00:09,460 --> 02:00:12,160
Sometimes people die and he's just,
hey,

3065
02:00:12,460 --> 02:00:15,550
we're going to do,
what does this President Johnson's

3066
02:00:15,551 --> 02:00:17,770
marines,
what'd he say to soldiers in the space?

3067
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:19,840
He wants to create a space for us.
Oh,

3068
02:00:19,841 --> 02:00:21,280
what dude?

3069
02:00:21,280 --> 02:00:23,950
Fuck yeah.
Why did he say let's shoot up the

3070
02:00:24,470 --> 02:00:29,470
strategy for space recognizes that space
as a war fighting domain.

3071
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:32,710
Well,
just like the land,

3072
02:00:32,711 --> 02:00:36,490
air and sea.
I don't like the way he says this.

3073
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:41,390
He even have us.
For us.

3074
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:47,440
We have the space for us with the navy
and a space for us.

3075
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:50,810
So what did he does is he has a bunch of
buddies that make spaceships.

3076
02:00:51,070 --> 02:00:53,560
So what he's going to do is they make a
fucking deal,

3077
02:00:53,610 --> 02:00:55,270
mechanized deal,
mechanized deal.

3078
02:00:55,271 --> 02:01:00,271
We sat down and we got a nice deal and
they're going to take another $4

3079
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:02,020
trillion and pump it into the space for
us.

3080
02:01:02,021 --> 02:01:04,150
And then they're going to,
they're all going to wear like Luke

3081
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:06,070
skywalker outfit,
right?

3082
02:01:06,071 --> 02:01:09,790
They're all going to wear some sort of
crazy space suit that looks dope and

3083
02:01:09,791 --> 02:01:11,110
we're going to be all on board.
Yeah.

3084
02:01:11,111 --> 02:01:13,180
Space Wars for dude.
Tight give.

3085
02:01:13,210 --> 02:01:17,350
Imagine we start seeing like overhead,
like we're in the sky a button.

3086
02:01:17,351 --> 02:01:21,130
We'll look at an and the night sky and
you see like a rocket ship flying back

3087
02:01:21,131 --> 02:01:22,410
and forth part of that,
uh,

3088
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:23,710
the tesla thing.
So cool.

3089
02:01:23,810 --> 02:01:27,310
It's showing the u s air force some
maneuverability thing,

3090
02:01:27,311 --> 02:01:32,311
whatever that was like the last hour of
the testing experiment with showing them

3091
02:01:32,651 --> 02:01:35,620
something that they could do that wasn't
really being talked about because the

3092
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:37,570
Eli musk shooting that car in this
space.

3093
02:01:37,571 --> 02:01:40,310
It's so funny.
Trump must so many people nervous

3094
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:44,100
and other countries like this,
like just have him talking about it.

3095
02:01:44,101 --> 02:01:47,300
Space war,
just as just talking to so flippantly.

3096
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:49,280
I think a lot of people,
a lot of people in other countries like

3097
02:01:49,281 --> 02:01:49,970
him,
I think there,

3098
02:01:49,970 --> 02:01:54,970
I think there are hammered by his,
his just complete disregard for rules.

3099
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:57,290
I think people love that.
He just doesn't give a shit.

3100
02:01:57,420 --> 02:01:58,770
You think so?
I think so.

3101
02:01:58,860 --> 02:02:02,660
Totally choose a terrified that this guy
is running America.

3102
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:05,570
I think like our friends do,
but I think that the majority of the

3103
02:02:05,571 --> 02:02:07,130
other countries that don't give a shit
about us are like,

3104
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:10,670
that guy's great.
I think our friendly countries,

3105
02:02:10,671 --> 02:02:13,340
you know like England,
I'm sure it's like he's a nuisance,

3106
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:14,150
you know?
But I think,

3107
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:15,740
I think countries don't give a fuck
about us are like,

3108
02:02:15,741 --> 02:02:18,950
that guy's hilarious.
That guy's a weirdo space war.

3109
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,720
Imagine we had a space where we in
Russia.

3110
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:24,170
That would be fucking awesome.
Be a great movie.

3111
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:27,080
Like how do we stop a war from breaking
out who?

3112
02:02:27,310 --> 02:02:29,540
Who was going to stop a war from
breaking out?

3113
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:31,790
Nobody took.
It seems like they just keep pushing

3114
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:33,830
each other.
Like someone's going to throw a sucker

3115
02:02:33,831 --> 02:02:34,361
punch.
Yeah.

3116
02:02:34,361 --> 02:02:35,310
It's going to happen.
Oh yeah,

3117
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:36,570
yeah,
yeah,

3118
02:02:37,330 --> 02:02:38,163
yeah.
Let's do it.

3119
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:40,940
Yeah.
And then finally they're in the fucking

3120
02:02:40,941 --> 02:02:43,220
hallway and they're pushing each other.
Right?

3121
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:45,950
No one wants to step two,
keep hitting one or two books out of

3122
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:47,240
each other's hands.
Yeah.

3123
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:50,450
And it's always right there.
So always right there.

3124
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:52,950
Okay.

3125
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:55,050
Then finally someone takes the hit.
Yeah.

3126
02:02:55,710 --> 02:02:56,543
Okay.

3127
02:02:56,630 --> 02:02:59,540
I mean,
it could easily happen with some little

3128
02:02:59,541 --> 02:03:00,940
banana republic.
Right?

3129
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:04,740
That could start it off.
Some crazy dictator in Venezuela or some

3130
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:08,210
shit could send a missile at some other
dude,

3131
02:03:08,211 --> 02:03:10,090
fuck him up and like,
oh bitch,

3132
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:12,500
that we're doing now.
And then we backed discount and then the

3133
02:03:12,501 --> 02:03:13,790
Russians back,
the other guys.

3134
02:03:14,150 --> 02:03:16,430
And next thing you know it,
old jetson millionaire and we're in a

3135
02:03:16,431 --> 02:03:19,440
fucking war.
I mean,

3136
02:03:19,730 --> 02:03:23,600
which were so weird about war.
It's like we accept the fact that war

3137
02:03:23,601 --> 02:03:26,030
exists,
but only when it's not near us.

3138
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,000
Not really interested in more.
That's clothes.

3139
02:03:28,060 --> 02:03:30,440
Can't be here.
Like we have war in Afghanistan.

3140
02:03:30,470 --> 02:03:30,821
Yeah,
yeah,

3141
02:03:30,821 --> 02:03:31,880
yeah.
But that's inevitable.

3142
02:03:32,210 --> 02:03:33,260
But war over here,
it's like,

3143
02:03:33,261 --> 02:03:34,220
no,
no way.

3144
02:03:34,280 --> 02:03:35,020
No Way.
No,

3145
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:36,020
no,
you can't.

3146
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,670
We don't.
But if we're going to have war over

3147
02:03:37,671 --> 02:03:39,230
here,
I hope we can contain it to like,

3148
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,170
you know,
like North Dakota or are you somewhere

3149
02:03:42,171 --> 02:03:44,150
where I'm not near some weird spot.

3150
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:46,810
Some spot where we're like to fight in
the middle with it and a lot of shit all

3151
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:49,400
over the spot.
You can have that area go fight right

3152
02:03:49,401 --> 02:03:50,234
here.
Yeah.

3153
02:03:50,330 --> 02:03:52,850
If we flew right here would be good.
Would it be the one like we all

3154
02:03:52,851 --> 02:03:55,160
designated this is the place we meet.
We fuck each other up.

3155
02:03:55,290 --> 02:03:57,260
What state?
Connecticut.

3156
02:03:57,261 --> 02:03:58,130
Connecticut.
Yeah,

3157
02:03:58,131 --> 02:03:59,450
for sure.
Nobody would cry.

3158
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,820
Fuck it.
That's like,

3159
02:04:01,821 --> 02:04:03,750
that's like afterschool fist fights of
like a,

3160
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:06,020
you are the secret garden dude.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

3161
02:04:06,021 --> 02:04:06,980
You know,
and you'd wait all day.

3162
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:08,990
People be talking about it like you
heard about the fat ass bro,

3163
02:04:09,340 --> 02:04:11,630
you to go the bass pro meet me in
Connecticut.

3164
02:04:13,870 --> 02:04:14,990
You want to solve this the right way,
dog,

3165
02:04:15,170 --> 02:04:17,430
you mean Connecticut?
Oh,

3166
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:20,090
I hope we don't get in a war now,
but we're in one.

3167
02:04:20,540 --> 02:04:21,890
Yeah,
see that's the thing.

3168
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:24,680
Like we are one with some dudes who
brought goats and they live in the

3169
02:04:24,681 --> 02:04:25,530
mountains.
Yeah,

3170
02:04:25,580 --> 02:04:26,790
we're in one with those guys,
but yeah,

3171
02:04:26,791 --> 02:04:27,171
yeah,
yeah.

3172
02:04:27,171 --> 02:04:28,340
But this is over there.
It's just doing,

3173
02:04:28,520 --> 02:04:30,500
I go to starbucks every day.
I don't feel it.

3174
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,090
I don't,
it's one of those that were at the war.

3175
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:35,180
I go to him and get my Nazi coffee out
in boyle heights and I'm straight.

3176
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:37,740
It's white people coffee,
weird white coffee,

3177
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:41,700
wp coffee.
It's just crazy that they could just

3178
02:04:41,701 --> 02:04:43,500
scream,
fuck white people.

3179
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:44,880
And everybody's like,
well,

3180
02:04:45,630 --> 02:04:47,580
you know,
they don't want to be gentrified.

3181
02:04:47,930 --> 02:04:49,640
No.
They'll know some of their say and

3182
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:51,720
somebody saying,
I mean,

3183
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:54,210
they don't want white people moving in
and opening up galleries.

3184
02:04:54,390 --> 02:04:55,380
You know,
what's another part of it?

3185
02:04:55,381 --> 02:04:57,810
This is where it gets really weird.
So I went into rabbit hole.

3186
02:04:57,811 --> 02:05:02,811
I started reading a lot of Isabella.
What I read was that part of it is being

3187
02:05:03,151 --> 02:05:08,151
hijacked by white artists that don't
like the people that own the gallery.

3188
02:05:08,431 --> 02:05:12,750
So they get on the side of the people
that want no gentrification and they

3189
02:05:12,751 --> 02:05:16,320
sabotage the gallery because they have a
personal feud with the guy who owns the

3190
02:05:16,321 --> 02:05:18,600
gallery does so far,
so there was a lot of that.

3191
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:22,380
It was white artists that we're teaming
up against the white people.

3192
02:05:22,380 --> 02:05:25,470
They're teaming up on the side of the
Hispanics to get,

3193
02:05:25,930 --> 02:05:27,360
yeah,
Mexicans,

3194
02:05:27,361 --> 02:05:28,021
Latinos.
I mean,

3195
02:05:28,021 --> 02:05:32,160
I don't know if it's all Mexicans.
I think east side is heavy.

3196
02:05:32,340 --> 02:05:35,370
There's a Honduran is all,
I mean it's just that neighborhood.

3197
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:38,370
It's just a,
it's generally known as a Latino

3198
02:05:38,371 --> 02:05:39,210
neighborhood.
Totally.

3199
02:05:39,570 --> 02:05:42,060
And these people want to keep it that
way,

3200
02:05:42,370 --> 02:05:44,700
but,
but it's just so fucked up.

3201
02:05:44,701 --> 02:05:49,590
Imagine if that was white people.
If Brown people were moving in and white

3202
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:52,080
people,
were we going to fuck brown art and fuck

3203
02:05:52,081 --> 02:05:57,060
the Nazis hate racism against white
people?

3204
02:05:57,061 --> 02:06:00,960
We don't automatically see it as racism,
including the people that are saying

3205
02:06:01,020 --> 02:06:04,140
fuck white art.
Like they don't think of it as racism

3206
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:08,160
because it's against the people that are
moving in that happened to be wealthy,

3207
02:06:08,161 --> 02:06:10,650
that can afford to buy,
totally pushing people out.

3208
02:06:10,651 --> 02:06:13,860
So if you say fuck white people,
it's not racist.

3209
02:06:14,070 --> 02:06:15,450
But the same people that agree with
that,

3210
02:06:15,630 --> 02:06:17,490
you know,
the same people that are like that or

3211
02:06:17,491 --> 02:06:20,820
like that or like the same white people
that agree with the protesting,

3212
02:06:21,090 --> 02:06:23,040
they're rich.
They're already up there anyway,

3213
02:06:23,070 --> 02:06:24,780
there's a little bit of that and there's
just,

3214
02:06:24,781 --> 02:06:27,150
it's convenient because they're not that
thing.

3215
02:06:27,151 --> 02:06:28,620
It's like I read,
um,

3216
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:33,690
this one woman was tweeting that a,
here's an unpopular opinion and not at

3217
02:06:33,691 --> 02:06:37,740
all uncomfortable about the idea of men
being falsely accused of sexual assault

3218
02:06:37,741 --> 02:06:42,510
and sexual harassment.
Like that is a crazy thing to say.

3219
02:06:42,511 --> 02:06:45,330
Like what if it was your son would,
if it was your brother,

3220
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:47,430
what was it?
What if it was your dad and they were a

3221
02:06:47,460 --> 02:06:49,470
good person and accused of something.
You're,

3222
02:06:49,471 --> 02:06:51,330
you're not,
you don't feel bad because you don't

3223
02:06:51,331 --> 02:06:52,590
like men.
All men suck.

3224
02:06:52,620 --> 02:06:53,453
Is that what it is?
Yeah,

3225
02:06:53,610 --> 02:06:54,660
that is sexist.

3226
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:56,490
But they do,
you might not think it's sexist,

3227
02:06:56,491 --> 02:06:57,960
but it's fucking sex.
It's hardcore sex.

3228
02:06:57,961 --> 02:07:01,020
If all men suck,
if all men were violent monsters,

3229
02:07:01,650 --> 02:07:02,670
girls,
you'd all be dead.

3230
02:07:02,930 --> 02:07:03,810
Right?
Okay.

3231
02:07:03,960 --> 02:07:07,170
You'd all be dead.
Someone along the way would have done

3232
02:07:07,171 --> 02:07:08,880
something terribly.
So we're not all bad.

3233
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:11,560
No.
Some of us are bad men are bad and that

3234
02:07:11,570 --> 02:07:12,130
I want to,
I don't,

3235
02:07:12,130 --> 02:07:14,880
I won't even say us.
Some males of the species are bad.

3236
02:07:14,881 --> 02:07:16,200
Some females are bad.
Yes.

3237
02:07:16,230 --> 02:07:17,450
Where's that?
That's not even a part of it.

3238
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:19,380
It's like people are bad.
I don't understand this whole thing.

3239
02:07:19,381 --> 02:07:21,330
Like all people are good.
Most people,

3240
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:22,950
I think people are good,
are good,

3241
02:07:23,070 --> 02:07:25,980
but a lot of people are not good.
There's a lot of people.

3242
02:07:26,160 --> 02:07:29,970
So if there's,
like we were talking about the,

3243
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:31,890
the number of,
uh,

3244
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:35,210
what was the,
that weird statistic about that.

3245
02:07:35,230 --> 02:07:36,370
We pulled up one

3246
02:07:36,370 --> 02:07:40,590
out of a
0.6% what was that?

3247
02:07:40,591 --> 02:07:42,790
That we were just discussing?
Yes.

3248
02:07:42,791 --> 02:07:44,290
Micro Penis people.
Right.

3249
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:46,780
So if that's how many people have a
micro penis,

3250
02:07:46,930 --> 02:07:49,840
how many people are fucking assholes?
Right?

3251
02:07:49,841 --> 02:07:52,120
More than have micro penises.
Way More.

3252
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:54,700
Yeah.
So if you have a hundred people right

3253
02:07:54,940 --> 02:07:59,940
and 0.6 have a micro penis to are
assholes flaming assholes.

3254
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:03,100
And imagine being an asshole and having
a micro penis,

3255
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:05,650
you're in trouble.
You got a real pro,

3256
02:08:05,651 --> 02:08:08,780
you probably never developed like real
asshole tendencies cause you know,

3257
02:08:08,781 --> 02:08:12,130
it'd be so intimidated at someone in the
middle of a ramp,

3258
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:14,950
just pull your pants down,
shut the fuck up.

3259
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:17,220
And then everyone's like,
oh my God,

3260
02:08:19,930 --> 02:08:22,330
there's way more assholes.
But some of those assholes are women.

3261
02:08:22,331 --> 02:08:24,760
So like on national women's day the
other day,

3262
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:26,800
like a couple people that I know
retweeted this,

3263
02:08:26,801 --> 02:08:28,480
someone was like believe women.

3264
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:30,070
Trust women,
embrace women,

3265
02:08:30,071 --> 02:08:31,060
support women.
There's

3266
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:34,120
some,
yes,

3267
02:08:34,540 --> 02:08:36,670
some are great,
some women are amazing,

3268
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:39,820
some men are amazing,
some humans are amazing.

3269
02:08:39,821 --> 02:08:43,210
It can be amazed.
It's whole like gravitating towards one

3270
02:08:43,211 --> 02:08:47,020
gender specifically just because they
have a vagina or specifically just

3271
02:08:47,021 --> 02:08:49,060
because they have a penis is equally
stupid,

3272
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:54,040
equally stupid on both sides,
and it also creates divisiveness.

3273
02:08:54,150 --> 02:08:56,860
Right?
It creates conflict because you were

3274
02:08:56,861 --> 02:09:00,520
aware us on the team penis,
that you're fully in supportive team

3275
02:09:00,521 --> 02:09:02,770
vagina.
That's all you're about,

3276
02:09:02,870 --> 02:09:04,930
right?
You're about teen vagina and you know it

3277
02:09:04,931 --> 02:09:06,490
was over here as a penis fan.
I'm like,

3278
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:07,960
this is bullshit.
You know,

3279
02:09:07,961 --> 02:09:10,030
I'm willing to tolerate those vagina
fans,

3280
02:09:10,450 --> 02:09:14,770
but they're shitting all over paid as
this hidden tardy you shitting on penis?

3281
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:18,370
I'm getting tired of it enough.
You know,

3282
02:09:18,371 --> 02:09:21,430
it's like Ken,
the dolphins and the raiders have a

3283
02:09:21,431 --> 02:09:23,170
healthy relationship amongst the fans.

3284
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:25,810
Can they get together and share a
stadium together without any gang

3285
02:09:25,811 --> 02:09:27,030
fights?
Nothing.

3286
02:09:27,050 --> 02:09:27,883
Impossible.
Nope.

3287
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:29,770
Not In that example.
No,

3288
02:09:29,890 --> 02:09:32,080
no,
but it's the same thing with team penis

3289
02:09:32,081 --> 02:09:34,570
versus team vagina.
Here's an unpopular opinion.

3290
02:09:34,780 --> 02:09:38,170
I'm not at all uncomfortable with
raiders fans getting gang raped or

3291
02:09:38,171 --> 02:09:41,620
stomped to death in the parking lot.
Fuck the raiders Hashtag fuck the

3292
02:09:41,621 --> 02:09:43,350
raiders,
right?

3293
02:09:43,490 --> 02:09:45,610
Yeah.
That's something a retard would say.

3294
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:48,520
Write a really stupid fuck who was like
a,

3295
02:09:48,521 --> 02:09:49,480
uh,
you know,

3296
02:09:49,530 --> 02:09:52,570
uh,
anti raiders guy would say something

3297
02:09:52,571 --> 02:09:54,280
like that and you'd get like a hundred
likes.

3298
02:09:55,210 --> 02:09:57,210
Fuck gone.
Fuck all call home.

3299
02:09:57,830 --> 02:10:00,280
Fuck Gum.
I hate the future is female quote.

3300
02:10:00,281 --> 02:10:03,460
I think it's such an annoying cook.
A good luck just eating each other's

3301
02:10:03,461 --> 02:10:04,570
pussies.
You crazy bitches,

3302
02:10:05,120 --> 02:10:07,750
but we're never going to get pregnant.
It's an insane thing to say.

3303
02:10:07,751 --> 02:10:09,770
It's so annoying.
It's a stupid thing to say.

3304
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:12,110
What are you really saying?
No one masculine.

3305
02:10:12,150 --> 02:10:12,850
Yeah.
Right.

3306
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:15,670
Imagine what a piece of shit you'd have
to be to walk around with tee shirt.

3307
02:10:15,671 --> 02:10:17,560
This is the future as mass masculine
bid.

3308
02:10:17,660 --> 02:10:19,780
Oh No.
The future is human beings.

3309
02:10:19,781 --> 02:10:21,490
Hopefully we're nice to each other,
getting along,

3310
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:23,860
doing each other good and being right to
one another.

3311
02:10:24,340 --> 02:10:25,900
We're all,
we're all important.

3312
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:27,610
All of us males,
females,

3313
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,410
everyone.
Yeah.

3314
02:10:28,410 --> 02:10:32,020
This whole ecosystem needs each other.
It's so funny,

3315
02:10:32,050 --> 02:10:35,660
but women can walk around those futures,
female shirts and not feel stupid.

3316
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,240
That's fucking because it's a big,
if it's supported,

3317
02:10:38,241 --> 02:10:38,860
right,
it's,

3318
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:41,080
hey,
what should we say that tell me I'm a

3319
02:10:41,090 --> 02:10:42,170
fucking love.
First of all,

3320
02:10:42,171 --> 02:10:43,940
love your shirt.
Amazing.

3321
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:46,310
It's amazing.
I'm with you.

3322
02:10:46,311 --> 02:10:48,980
100% sister.
They can do that here,

3323
02:10:49,790 --> 02:10:51,530
but I'm here to tell you,
you go do that in certain parts of the

3324
02:10:51,531 --> 02:10:53,690
country and people are like,
fuck is that shit?

3325
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:58,520
The fuck is that dog?
It's crazy when it's heterosexual women.

3326
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:00,770
Can you imagine if Mensa,
Doug futures masculine,

3327
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:02,720
we're just going to wrench,
we're going to be done with all this

3328
02:11:02,721 --> 02:11:07,721
girl short or just right.
Squirrel's suck.

3329
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:09,020
Come here Steve.
Yeah,

3330
02:11:09,021 --> 02:11:11,360
it's stupid.
It's stupid like this.

3331
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:15,590
It is general.
I mean it does like taking one gender

3332
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:17,840
and deciding that's what you're really
into,

3333
02:11:18,260 --> 02:11:20,420
that it's just as stupid as take you one
skin color.

3334
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:21,950
Totally.
Just as stupid as I am.

3335
02:11:21,951 --> 02:11:24,740
Really only in the dudes were over six
feet tall.

3336
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:27,080
I'm six feet tall.
Should be dead.

3337
02:11:27,410 --> 02:11:29,550
I don't want to talk to them.
I have a team,

3338
02:11:29,551 --> 02:11:31,130
Marty team,
six feet.

3339
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,570
We can always decide some new thing that
we don't like somebody about.

3340
02:11:35,730 --> 02:11:38,090
Right or four and so we always decide
like,

3341
02:11:38,091 --> 02:11:39,650
hey,
those fucking assholes from when the

3342
02:11:39,651 --> 02:11:43,040
town across the tracks,
like we'll have like a boundary line.

3343
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:45,480
This side,
those people with them imaginary wise,

3344
02:11:45,980 --> 02:11:47,400
we put up a fence.
Fuck you,

3345
02:11:47,420 --> 02:11:48,600
fuck them,
we'll stay.

3346
02:11:49,020 --> 02:11:52,940
We're going to meet in the parking lot
on Saturday night and if they don't say

3347
02:11:52,941 --> 02:11:54,580
that we're the best,
we're going to fucking kill them.

3348
02:11:56,770 --> 02:11:59,210
It's and people don't see it for
whatever reason.

3349
02:11:59,211 --> 02:12:01,280
If you have a future is female tee shirt
on,

3350
02:12:01,281 --> 02:12:05,710
you don't see it that way because you
are just in support of feminism and the

3351
02:12:05,711 --> 02:12:09,050
support of equal rights and supportive
women doing powerful things and you

3352
02:12:09,051 --> 02:12:10,640
think this is a step in the right
direction,

3353
02:12:10,850 --> 02:12:11,870
but it's not.
No.

3354
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:13,640
The future is females,
not a,

3355
02:12:13,670 --> 02:12:17,000
that's not a message that is good.
The future is happy,

3356
02:12:17,001 --> 02:12:18,770
loving people.
That's a good message.

3357
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:19,581
Good.
The future is good,

3358
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:21,710
honest people not not fucking hurting
each other.

3359
02:12:21,711 --> 02:12:26,711
People trying to do well for each other,
trying to facilitate communication and

3360
02:12:26,901 --> 02:12:30,650
growth and learning about each other and
tolerance like just be nice to each

3361
02:12:30,651 --> 02:12:32,990
other,
not the future's masculine.

3362
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:36,170
Fuck off you dork.
You've fucking half a man.

3363
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:39,050
You have a man.
Imagine if a guy's,

3364
02:12:39,060 --> 02:12:41,060
he's got the t shirt that says the
future is male.

3365
02:12:41,290 --> 02:12:42,800
He's a tattoo.
It's right above his dick.

3366
02:12:44,090 --> 02:12:47,840
He shows it sometimes.
Sometimes you could see like the top

3367
02:12:47,841 --> 02:12:50,720
letters because it's shaped like a,
like got a big smiley face.

3368
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:53,000
It's a smile,
but it says the future's masculine.

3369
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:57,680
He could see the e and the t poking out
of his underwear when he takes those

3370
02:12:57,681 --> 02:13:00,470
Dick route pictures.
You know those pictures of guys take

3371
02:13:00,471 --> 02:13:01,880
with,
they pull the pants down time.

3372
02:13:02,040 --> 02:13:03,260
Yeah.
You know those,

3373
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:04,153
those guys,
they'll,

3374
02:13:04,160 --> 02:13:06,320
they'll take a picture,
they're painting the fuck runway and all

3375
02:13:06,321 --> 02:13:10,760
that shit right to the Dick root
sweatpants and just get back from the

3376
02:13:10,761 --> 02:13:13,280
gym.
Like basically showing the base of their

3377
02:13:13,281 --> 02:13:14,990
cock.
Cause I got the fucking,

3378
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:16,420
the runners,
the fuck runner muscles.

3379
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:17,360
The fuck muscles.
Yeah.

3380
02:13:17,361 --> 02:13:19,760
That's where Jamie's got that.
The future is masculine.

3381
02:13:19,770 --> 02:13:22,940
Quote.
Did you get it removed?

3382
02:13:23,920 --> 02:13:25,070
Second.
I need to go back.

3383
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:27,030
You can't go just once.
Yeah.

3384
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:29,450
It takes a long time.
Lasers above your deck has to be very

3385
02:13:29,451 --> 02:13:32,190
nerve wracking.
You know they make you put goggles on

3386
02:13:34,980 --> 02:13:36,410
when they were moving.
Tattoos,

3387
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:37,411
pop,
pop,

3388
02:13:37,411 --> 02:13:38,280
pop.
So painful.

3389
02:13:38,430 --> 02:13:40,050
It's like this shoot a laser.
It's,

3390
02:13:40,060 --> 02:13:41,890
it looks like the most painful shit I've
ever seen in my lessons.

3391
02:13:41,940 --> 02:13:42,870
Crackling,
pop,

3392
02:13:42,871 --> 02:13:43,231
pop,
pop,

3393
02:13:43,231 --> 02:13:43,591
pop,
pop,

3394
02:13:43,591 --> 02:13:44,480
pop.
Then listen to it as,

3395
02:13:45,370 --> 02:13:47,160
oh it's fucking awful.
You're cooking,

3396
02:13:47,220 --> 02:13:48,360
you're cooking the skin,
right?

3397
02:13:48,390 --> 02:13:49,000
Yeah.
Yeah.

3398
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:50,130
You have to burn it.
You have to burn it.

3399
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:53,310
Yeah.
I knew this girl was getting this big

3400
02:13:53,311 --> 02:13:58,311
tattoo on her back removed and she was
at the beach and like her whole back was

3401
02:13:58,651 --> 02:14:01,500
like,
her lower back was this big red thing.

3402
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:03,990
It was like,
it was halfway done and had like,

3403
02:14:03,991 --> 02:14:07,410
she had just gotten a recent,
like she had put sunscreen all over it

3404
02:14:07,650 --> 02:14:09,470
because it couldn't hit the sun.
Yeah.

3405
02:14:09,630 --> 02:14:10,440
It was like,
whoa.

3406
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:12,170
What is that like?
What are you doing?

3407
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:13,980
You're cooking your skin.
Do you have any tattoos?

3408
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:14,873
Yeah.
Me,

3409
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:15,750
I got,
I got none.

3410
02:14:15,870 --> 02:14:17,370
My whole arms or sleeved.
Oh yeah.

3411
02:14:17,371 --> 02:14:18,870
What am I thinking?
What the fuck am I talking about?

3412
02:14:18,900 --> 02:14:21,110
The new tattoo removal technology.
Look at,

3413
02:14:21,120 --> 02:14:24,930
the guy's got to get goggles on.
It's so funny.

3414
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:25,741
I'm like,
you have tattoos.

3415
02:14:25,741 --> 02:14:27,750
I know you have tons of tattoos.
I'm not thinking cause I'm not seeing

3416
02:14:27,751 --> 02:14:28,980
any.
Well I'm covered up.

3417
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:30,450
Yeah,
but you will often cover him up.

3418
02:14:30,510 --> 02:14:32,550
Well,
because they're a distraction like on

3419
02:14:32,551 --> 02:14:33,271
stage.
Yeah,

3420
02:14:33,271 --> 02:14:34,480
you do that.
He's just going over.

3421
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,960
That's pretty amazing.
How quick it makes it disappear.

3422
02:14:37,350 --> 02:14:39,600
Is that new someone the other day that
was just like,

3423
02:14:39,601 --> 02:14:41,400
she was going over the skin and it was
not,

3424
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:45,920
it didn't seem like it was harming the
untattooed so you know what they say?

3425
02:14:46,020 --> 02:14:47,050
It's kind of like,
um,

3426
02:14:47,630 --> 02:14:49,710
it looks,
it looks whoa.

3427
02:14:49,711 --> 02:14:53,790
That's crazy.
That is fucking crazy.

3428
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,310
But you still have to go back a bunch.

3429
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:57,900
Yeah.
Maybe you do bro.

3430
02:14:59,180 --> 02:15:01,200
I got one stocky.
I go once bro.

3431
02:15:01,850 --> 02:15:03,960
Um,
it seems like it would be amazing where,

3432
02:15:03,961 --> 02:15:07,860
where's that shit that was in?
This is Spa Medica,

3433
02:15:07,861 --> 02:15:11,100
but I don't know a,
I have a old tattoo on my shoulder that

3434
02:15:11,101 --> 02:15:13,170
I want to get rid of so I could finish
my right sleeve.

3435
02:15:13,230 --> 02:15:15,420
It says the future is masculine.
It does.

3436
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:19,000
It says it all dicks spelled out with
[inaudible].

3437
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:22,260
Do you know you're like you have a
picture and you look very close to the

3438
02:15:22,261 --> 02:15:23,310
picture.
It's really magic.

3439
02:15:23,311 --> 02:15:27,120
I,
it's all other pictures put together to

3440
02:15:27,121 --> 02:15:28,680
make it feel like a bunch of different
portraits.

3441
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:30,380
All to make one portrait.
He cool?

3442
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,150
Yeah.
You do all dicks.

3443
02:15:32,340 --> 02:15:34,140
Yeah.
You'd have to go to a master tattoo

3444
02:15:34,141 --> 02:15:35,280
artist.
Wow.

3445
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:38,940
This guy covering his eyes.
He's got tattoos all over his face.

3446
02:15:38,941 --> 02:15:42,390
Holy Shit Man.
I am seeing more that than I've ever

3447
02:15:42,391 --> 02:15:44,310
seen in my life.
That's the new shit dude.

3448
02:15:44,490 --> 02:15:45,091
Wow.
Quick.

3449
02:15:45,091 --> 02:15:46,620
That works man.
That's incredible.

3450
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,260
So this is a,
how old's that article?

3451
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:51,120
Like new,
it's pretty new this year,

3452
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:56,180
so I don't know if there's any places.
Thank you from he came me and let me get

3453
02:15:58,010 --> 02:15:59,130
something removed.

3454
02:16:01,450 --> 02:16:04,470
Gainey
you don't have any,

3455
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:05,670
you've got none.
Nothing.

3456
02:16:05,730 --> 02:16:07,020
I think about getting something.
Nope.

3457
02:16:07,230 --> 02:16:09,150
Not even after this conversation.
Nope.

3458
02:16:09,180 --> 02:16:12,150
What about the future is masculine maybe
should all get that and maybe I'll give

3459
02:16:12,170 --> 02:16:13,003
shit.
Yeah,

3460
02:16:13,030 --> 02:16:15,420
I might get that,
but I want to get it above my butt.

3461
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:17,550
So when you know,
whenever there's a guy back there and

3462
02:16:17,551 --> 02:16:20,100
he's looking down and he can know that
I'm a support,

3463
02:16:20,101 --> 02:16:24,250
a dude's
help me and you bud,

3464
02:16:24,490 --> 02:16:26,340
you immune together with the right
ideas.

3465
02:16:26,341 --> 02:16:27,390
And if I've never,
I've no I,

3466
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:30,100
no I can't.
I don't think I can commit

3467
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,510
to something like that.
No,

3468
02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:34,150
I couldn't do it.
They're the fucking getting a tattoo to

3469
02:16:34,151 --> 02:16:35,040
me was always like,
hi,

3470
02:16:35,041 --> 02:16:36,340
I just can't,
I fucking can't do it.

3471
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:38,320
I thought about it for years and then I
was like,

3472
02:16:38,470 --> 02:16:40,060
but every friend I had had got a bad
one.

3473
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:43,880
Isn't the future is feminine sort of
like if you have a brown power tattoo,

3474
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:46,610
you're allowed to have brown power.
Brown power.

3475
02:16:46,640 --> 02:16:47,473
Yeah.

3476
02:16:47,490 --> 02:16:49,410
If you had a brown power tattoo.
Yeah.

3477
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:52,440
If you're brown person,
traditional laser does this place in

3478
02:16:52,441 --> 02:16:53,580
Beverly Hills,
the Pico.

3479
02:16:53,581 --> 02:16:54,870
Sure laser.
What does it do?

3480
02:16:55,140 --> 02:16:56,700
It goes,
this gone.

3481
02:16:56,780 --> 02:16:57,960
So you a book out

3482
02:16:58,400 --> 02:16:59,890
the fuck Outta here.
Bitch.

3483
02:17:00,700 --> 02:17:03,520
Done.
That looks pretty dope,

3484
02:17:03,521 --> 02:17:05,230
dude.
I might have to go get that shit done

3485
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:07,810
because I've been putting off getting
this tattoo.

3486
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:09,790
Who's the broad at the bottom?
I don't know.

3487
02:17:10,210 --> 02:17:10,811
Yeah,
she's good.

3488
02:17:10,811 --> 02:17:11,561
Like she's like,
Hey,

3489
02:17:11,561 --> 02:17:14,110
I had one about my box and uh,
they took it out.

3490
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:16,710
She's a bunch of,
she had a bunch of gang stuff on her

3491
02:17:16,711 --> 02:17:18,700
forehead,
wants a Dick's point into my brother.

3492
02:17:18,720 --> 02:17:20,520
I was a kid.
I was a gang that was in a gang.

3493
02:17:20,521 --> 02:17:22,320
Just disappears.
I love that.

3494
02:17:22,410 --> 02:17:25,470
Revealing a beautiful future.
This is the real truth.

3495
02:17:25,740 --> 02:17:28,110
This is how it actually happens,
you know,

3496
02:17:28,111 --> 02:17:29,550
and I,
you know what I need in here right now.

3497
02:17:29,551 --> 02:17:31,530
I need a pee bucket.
I have to pee so bad.

3498
02:17:31,531 --> 02:17:32,364
And you're like,
hey man,

3499
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:34,230
don't worry about it.
We'll talk shit about you while you're

3500
02:17:34,231 --> 02:17:36,390
gone.
What makes him comfortable that we talk

3501
02:17:36,391 --> 02:17:37,350
about,
we'll start with that.

3502
02:17:39,420 --> 02:17:40,500
The future is masculine.

3503
02:17:42,170 --> 02:17:45,450
Just makes me sad.
I get the Sun.

3504
02:17:45,470 --> 02:17:48,650
I'm a hypocrite though because like one
of my favorite fighters,

3505
02:17:48,651 --> 02:17:51,500
Cain Velasquez,
he's got brown pride tattooed on his

3506
02:17:51,501 --> 02:17:53,570
chest.
Never bothered me for a second.

3507
02:17:54,020 --> 02:17:59,020
His Dad walked here from fucking Mexico
and you know like if you're a part of a

3508
02:17:59,181 --> 02:18:04,160
disenfranchised community,
if you feel like you are and you have

3509
02:18:04,161 --> 02:18:06,080
that on,
it's like you're taking pride in

3510
02:18:06,081 --> 02:18:08,090
something that's considered maligned.
Right.

3511
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:13,400
But I guess women would think the same
way in a more mild way that they're

3512
02:18:13,430 --> 02:18:15,860
disenfranchised to where are they going
to do with all their,

3513
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:17,510
that tramp stamp thing that's done
right.

3514
02:18:17,930 --> 02:18:19,790
No,
some girls are still getting them now.

3515
02:18:19,880 --> 02:18:20,930
Yeah.
Really.

3516
02:18:20,990 --> 02:18:22,340
It's some dumb people out there bro.

3517
02:18:24,860 --> 02:18:26,120
Okay.
But what does the tramp stamp?

3518
02:18:26,121 --> 02:18:27,980
A tramp stamp is only when it's your
lower back.

3519
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:31,670
Right.
But your whole back like I know a lot of

3520
02:18:31,671 --> 02:18:33,020
people that are getting their whole back
done.

3521
02:18:33,350 --> 02:18:33,980
Right.
That's,

3522
02:18:33,980 --> 02:18:34,820
that's,
that's,

3523
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:37,790
I mean they're getting there but done
everything,

3524
02:18:38,630 --> 02:18:40,460
which I think is probably not the best
move.

3525
02:18:40,910 --> 02:18:45,230
Cause like acids look really good when
they're well formed.

3526
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:47,420
Like to put,
you know what it's like.

3527
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:50,060
It always seems to me what he's showing
me.

3528
02:18:50,090 --> 02:18:50,923
Wow.
Look at that.

3529
02:18:51,380 --> 02:18:52,910
God Damn,
that's gorgeous.

3530
02:18:53,120 --> 02:18:54,080
Look,
go back to that.

3531
02:18:54,081 --> 02:18:56,990
A full screen like grill below goal.
Go below.

3532
02:18:57,260 --> 02:18:58,093
Go below.
Sorry.

3533
02:18:58,410 --> 02:19:01,460
There's a tiger low right that,
that screen.

3534
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:03,440
Look at that one right there.
Bam.

3535
02:19:03,441 --> 02:19:04,880
Look at that back.
Holy Shit.

3536
02:19:04,881 --> 02:19:07,460
That's crazy.
That's really good work.

3537
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:09,170
Who made that one?
Does it say,

3538
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:14,300
I'll just says a hundred awesome back
tattoo ideas.

3539
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:16,190
Yeah.
I just think,

3540
02:19:16,191 --> 02:19:17,450
ladies,
leave your ass alone.

3541
02:19:17,780 --> 02:19:21,040
Please don't get crazy.
Wow.

3542
02:19:22,570 --> 02:19:24,470
Like,
or if you're asked is so good,

3543
02:19:24,500 --> 02:19:26,540
you could tattoo the shit out of it and
still looks amazing,

3544
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:30,440
but you gotta be really careful what
artists you go to.

3545
02:19:30,830 --> 02:19:35,150
That is the thing about tattoos.
You got to really make sure like a,

3546
02:19:35,240 --> 02:19:37,640
before I got my sleep,
I got my sleeves done by this guy,

3547
02:19:37,670 --> 02:19:41,210
Aaron Dellavedova.
Shout out to Aaron from Guru Tattoo in

3548
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:43,670
San Diego.
I'd seen his work online a bunch.

3549
02:19:43,671 --> 02:19:45,740
I mean,
he's a real legit artist.

3550
02:19:45,741 --> 02:19:50,240
His work's amazing.
I knew that this guy was like super good

3551
02:19:50,241 --> 02:19:52,280
at tattoos,
but there's a lot of people that get

3552
02:19:52,281 --> 02:19:55,010
some whack ass tattoos.
I don't want to stand out.

3553
02:19:55,011 --> 02:19:57,620
People don't have time.
They don't have the patience to wait for

3554
02:19:57,860 --> 02:19:59,980
that good artist or we get nutty.
I need it today,

3555
02:20:00,140 --> 02:20:04,910
you know?
Do you have tattoos all over his Dick

3556
02:20:04,910 --> 02:20:06,200
Davies,
that one that we saw about a one

3557
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:08,480
removed.
Get a better one that we know.

3558
02:20:08,780 --> 02:20:10,640
Have you seen they have glow in the dark
tattoos now?

3559
02:20:10,950 --> 02:20:12,260
Yeah.
Gotta be good for you.

3560
02:20:12,300 --> 02:20:12,680
Yeah.
Right.

3561
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:13,820
Whatever.
It makes it fall on the dark.

3562
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:16,190
Definitely not going to fuck you up for
the rest of your life.

3563
02:20:16,250 --> 02:20:17,450
It's all natural.
Yeah.

3564
02:20:17,451 --> 02:20:19,370
As far as we know,
if you were going to get a tattoo,

3565
02:20:19,371 --> 02:20:20,204
what do you think you'd get?

3566
02:20:22,180 --> 02:20:22,580
Yeah,

3567
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:24,570
so I don't eat pride.
Yeah.

3568
02:20:24,750 --> 02:20:25,590
Or like,
well,

3569
02:20:25,591 --> 02:20:27,200
white power maybe.
Wow.

3570
02:20:27,270 --> 02:20:28,770
Darn Tattoos.
That's amazing.

3571
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:32,350
That looks fucking cool.
Wow.

3572
02:20:32,351 --> 02:20:33,181
Shit.
Look it.

3573
02:20:33,181 --> 02:20:33,641
Look it.
Look,

3574
02:20:33,641 --> 02:20:36,160
that's amazing.
Holy Shit Dude.

3575
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:38,770
That would back up to that last one that
you just went to know what?

3576
02:20:38,771 --> 02:20:42,580
The girls back right there.
No to the right of that one to the right

3577
02:20:42,581 --> 02:20:43,414
of that one.
No,

3578
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:45,970
look at that picture over the top bar
and go to the right of it.

3579
02:20:46,450 --> 02:20:47,560
The one that did.
That's it.

3580
02:20:47,590 --> 02:20:48,460
There you go.
Bam.

3581
02:20:48,570 --> 02:20:49,420
Look at that.
Wow.

3582
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:50,440
Fuck Dude.

3583
02:20:51,430 --> 02:20:51,870
Yeah.

3584
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:53,760
That's a good someone's arm.
Raise that someone arms.

3585
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:54,540
Does that an arm?
Yeah.

3586
02:20:54,540 --> 02:20:55,373
Oh,
I thought it was her back.

3587
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:58,920
Oh,
I thought it was like leaning forward.

3588
02:20:58,950 --> 02:20:59,880
Buck.
That's incredible.

3589
02:20:59,910 --> 02:21:00,830
That's amazing.
Yeah.

3590
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:01,920
Then you have black lights over your
house.

3591
02:21:01,921 --> 02:21:04,020
Like your college again though.
Whoa.

3592
02:21:04,080 --> 02:21:04,770
Yeah.
Right.

3593
02:21:04,770 --> 02:21:08,220
Like your whole house is a college dorm.
You have to have black lights everywhere

3594
02:21:08,221 --> 02:21:10,620
and you have to have like a empty booze
bottles filled with like uh,

3595
02:21:10,710 --> 02:21:13,860
things that make them glow and shit.
Every room you go into as a college dorm

3596
02:21:13,861 --> 02:21:16,350
because you are the black light light
poster.

3597
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:20,030
That's what I get.
Probably something to throw something

3598
02:21:20,050 --> 02:21:21,540
representative of Chicago back home.

3599
02:21:21,580 --> 02:21:25,220
Jeff fucking Chicago is a town,
a deep dish pizza in a brand,

3600
02:21:25,221 --> 02:21:28,510
like get a old style and a hat dog on my
shoulder.

3601
02:21:28,511 --> 02:21:31,660
Shit,
a snow shovel and a fucking bratwurst.

3602
02:21:34,190 --> 02:21:36,930
He's got a high cholesterol chart
reading everything.

3603
02:21:36,931 --> 02:21:40,220
He was up at the top problem,
probably fine,

3604
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:42,880
but everybody's fine.
Don't worry about it.

3605
02:21:43,270 --> 02:21:47,230
Everyone's got affect gut and then find
and a big smile heard you make it fun.

3606
02:21:47,260 --> 02:21:49,810
Or Joe Rogan's making fun of us stowed
on a line.

3607
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:51,640
Should in Chicago.
Tell him to fuck off.

3608
02:21:51,641 --> 02:21:53,140
That's what I say to Joe Rogan.
Swell.

3609
02:21:53,141 --> 02:21:56,170
Boycott your fucking shitty show on June
8th.

3610
02:21:57,220 --> 02:22:02,220
Hey is Joe Rogan Chin na Seth Rogan's to
get a browder's Joe Rogan Jay know it

3611
02:22:02,851 --> 02:22:05,260

3612
02:22:05,261 --> 02:22:08,240
right in front Guy Seth Rogen,

3613
02:22:08,480 --> 02:22:09,900

Sorry Dude.

3616
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:15,720
Who is this?
A dumb way of spelling it.

3617
02:22:15,721 --> 02:22:19,770
You got to stop using an e at the end.
Rogin rock n roll again.

3618
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:20,880
It's Rogan,
Rogan,

3619
02:22:20,910 --> 02:22:23,100
R.
G.

3620
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:23,100
A.
N.

3621
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:23,430
S.
English.

3622
02:22:23,430 --> 02:22:24,540
Mine's Irish.
His,

3623
02:22:24,541 --> 02:22:25,470
his English.
Some.

3624
02:22:25,830 --> 02:22:27,480
Did you see this crazy soccer?
Yeah,

3625
02:22:27,950 --> 02:22:30,150
this is $500.
Uh,

3626
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,760
gravity bomb.
It's a little too much for gravity bong,

3627
02:22:32,761 --> 02:22:36,150
but you just smoke a joint.
$500 for gravity bong.

3628
02:22:36,180 --> 02:22:37,440
But I look at it,
it looks crazy.

3629
02:22:37,470 --> 02:22:38,970
Yeah.
Shares with a real good idea.

3630
02:22:39,030 --> 02:22:40,950
Look,
we were joint

3631
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:44,520
wash and flipped it.
Look at a flips a shit.

3632
02:22:44,521 --> 02:22:45,170
Right.
Upside down.

3633
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:46,070
Lighter.
Yeah.

3634
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:47,490
Gas Station.
Lighter joint.

3635
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:48,390
Oh,
we're good.

3636
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:52,080
You don't need a $500 bond.
Seth Rogan so serious.

3637
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:58,710
I handed him stoner of the year award
once one of the high times awards,

3638
02:23:00,090 --> 02:23:02,340
500 bucks out of the wood.
That's ridiculous.

3639
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:04,590
People are always trying to give me
these fucking things.

3640
02:23:04,710 --> 02:23:07,300
Did you get stoner of the year award?
Yeah,

3641
02:23:07,320 --> 02:23:09,480
I got it once right.
Did I get it?

3642
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:12,090
They were offering it to me.
I think I might have had to go to get

3643
02:23:12,091 --> 02:23:13,010
it.
As you said,

3644
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,370
you probably were like,
I can't go man.

3645
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:15,810
Yeah.
I'm Muslim gun and go.

3646
02:23:15,811 --> 02:23:19,260
I'm not going to say I can't go.
I hosted the doobies one year,

3647
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:22,230
which was fun.
It was like an award show that was in

3648
02:23:22,231 --> 02:23:25,230
like 2001 yeah.
And then,

3649
02:23:25,231 --> 02:23:28,230
uh,
I gave an award to seth rogen and

3650
02:23:28,231 --> 02:23:30,870
another time,
but they've asked me to perform at those

3651
02:23:30,871 --> 02:23:34,010
before and I did it once.
Where the doobies it's just everyone's

3652
02:23:34,030 --> 02:23:36,600
high as a kite.
It's all weird.

3653
02:23:36,930 --> 02:23:39,090
It's this,
I mean you just,

3654
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:42,570
there's so out of it.
Crazy show ever.

3655
02:23:42,840 --> 02:23:45,120
It's the underground comedy show in
Toronto.

3656
02:23:45,170 --> 02:23:49,830
Do you haven't done that place dude,
they have a bong shop and in the back

3657
02:23:49,831 --> 02:23:54,831
room it's all a comedy show,
but it's all people smoking pot in the

3658
02:23:55,021 --> 02:23:57,120
room.
It's a hot button while you're doing the

3659
02:23:57,121 --> 02:23:58,380
show.
Yeah,

3660
02:23:58,381 --> 02:24:00,150
they have bongs on the tables,
dude.

3661
02:24:00,151 --> 02:24:04,500
People are blitzkrieg.
You are so high when you're on stage,

3662
02:24:04,501 --> 02:24:07,140
you can't remember what you were talking
about three seconds ago.

3663
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:11,730
I mean it's so bad and it's thick.
Like smoke everywhere.

3664
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:14,160
Like the hope,
there's no ventilation kit to material.

3665
02:24:14,161 --> 02:24:15,780
You just have to go fuck around.
Yeah.

3666
02:24:15,781 --> 02:24:18,420
I mean you could try to do material.
I definitely have tried,

3667
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:21,130
but like I took Tripoli there and aaa
doesn't really get high.

3668
02:24:21,580 --> 02:24:23,160
Um,
at least he didn't.

3669
02:24:23,360 --> 02:24:23,690
I don't know.

3670
02:24:23,690 --> 02:24:25,950
I don't think he does time.
I think he might've been sober,

3671
02:24:26,130 --> 02:24:28,980
but dude,
he got blitzkrieg just breathing the air

3672
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:30,810
in this place.
Fucking ripped the whole,

3673
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:34,350
the whole place is bomb was,
I don't think it was a,

3674
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:38,940
I don't think anyone bombed Syria bomb
venue where you're like,

3675
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:40,710
I'm never going to do well in here.
They don't fucking,

3676
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:42,450
they're not paying attention.
You're just out of it.

3677
02:24:42,470 --> 02:24:43,980
It's just the whole thing.
You're off,

3678
02:24:44,010 --> 02:24:45,120
everything's off.
Right.

3679
02:24:45,150 --> 02:24:47,730
You're so hot.
But that's also where I did a thing on

3680
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:50,910
the iron sheik came on stage and that
place you ever seen that video of the

3681
02:24:50,911 --> 02:24:54,780
iron cheek?
Joe Rogan's and he starts talking to me

3682
02:24:54,781 --> 02:24:57,930
and that's when I realized the price
that pro wrestlers pay,

3683
02:24:58,110 --> 02:25:01,890
like the health,
like this poor fellows in crutches and

3684
02:25:01,891 --> 02:25:03,090
shit.
He could barely walk.

3685
02:25:03,150 --> 02:25:04,440
That's him and me on stage.

3686
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:21,500
Fuck Joe Rogan chocolates.
Sparkling three stolen gutter quarter

3687
02:25:25,390 --> 02:25:30,390
Roman or you have the toughest sport in
the Olympics is freestyle wrestling

3688
02:25:31,481 --> 02:25:33,700
serve.
I'm so nerdy

3689
02:25:36,790 --> 02:25:41,790
because he know to you.
I didn't know how to change

3690
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:45,560
lights

3691
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:49,770
of my life being on stage.
Hi is giraffe pussy talking to the iron

3692
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:52,160
cheek in a room with a pot leaf behind
me.

3693
02:25:52,730 --> 02:25:56,690
That's a big old pot leaf.
Was He ripped him sober?

3694
02:25:56,691 --> 02:25:59,000
I in the house.
There was no one sober in that place.

3695
02:25:59,030 --> 02:25:59,631
I don't,
I don't,

3696
02:25:59,631 --> 02:26:02,390
I literally don't think it would be
possible to be sober in that room.

3697
02:26:02,391 --> 02:26:04,460
I just don't think you could be.
There's no air in that room.

3698
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:05,780
They trap you.
Yeah,

3699
02:26:05,781 --> 02:26:09,080
I like all the fire.
There's fire like the little candles and

3700
02:26:09,081 --> 02:26:11,030
stuff on a table and like it's running
an air.

3701
02:26:11,031 --> 02:26:14,810
They don't have any air to stay lit.
The flame is flickering out so we didn't

3702
02:26:14,811 --> 02:26:17,600
smoke in here.
Everybody's like lists like the whole

3703
02:26:17,601 --> 02:26:19,190
August lights,
candles burn on weed.

3704
02:26:19,191 --> 02:26:20,630
Joe.
It's fine.

3705
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:23,180
But the shows,
they're always real weird.

3706
02:26:23,570 --> 02:26:25,160
People go there and just,
it's in Vancouver?

3707
02:26:25,490 --> 02:26:26,390
No,
it's Toronto.

3708
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:27,253
Toronto,
Toronto.

3709
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:31,070
I forget what it's called.
Comedy underground or something like

3710
02:26:31,071 --> 02:26:34,400
that.
Puff Puff Mama around comedy club.

3711
02:26:34,940 --> 02:26:36,100
Underground comedy club.
Yeah.

3712
02:26:36,770 --> 02:26:38,780
We've done it a couple of times and he's
still doing shows and shit there.

3713
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:40,460
I don't know.
They think so.

3714
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:41,600
Yeah.
They don't give up.

3715
02:26:41,690 --> 02:26:44,330
They forgot every time they get to high,
they forgot they got through high.

3716
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:45,980
We had to stop it,
but we didn't remember.

3717
02:26:45,981 --> 02:26:47,570
Dude,
who's coming up there?

3718
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,450
Give them a plug.
Underground comedy Puff Mama.

3719
02:26:50,451 --> 02:26:51,200
Dot.
Ca.

3720
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:53,180
There you go.
Fun Fun place though.

3721
02:26:53,181 --> 02:26:55,820
And very,
very nice people did it a few times.

3722
02:26:56,690 --> 02:26:58,700
Dope.
And they did tell a bunch of people that

3723
02:26:58,701 --> 02:27:01,400
I was coming and it wasn't coming and
then people got mad at me and I'm like,

3724
02:27:01,401 --> 02:27:02,410
Hey,
Yay.

3725
02:27:02,420 --> 02:27:05,630
I didn't fucking say I was coming.
Somebody set up a fund in there

3726
02:27:06,050 --> 02:27:07,310
somewhere.
Promotes your shit and you're like,

3727
02:27:07,311 --> 02:27:09,330
did I say it or did you hear it from
another party?

3728
02:27:09,330 --> 02:27:11,560
He didn't hear me promising you fucking
boom.

3729
02:27:11,570 --> 02:27:13,450
What you going to be there bro?
We got tickets.

3730
02:27:13,900 --> 02:27:15,170
Told the truth before.
Joel,

3731
02:27:15,171 --> 02:27:16,670
get tickets.
Your ruler boys.

3732
02:27:17,660 --> 02:27:19,820
Hey,
just so many people,

3733
02:27:19,850 --> 02:27:20,990
there's just so many people in the
world.

3734
02:27:21,170 --> 02:27:23,450
Where's your least favorite spot to
perform?

3735
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:26,060
I don't really have one.
There's not like a city,

3736
02:27:26,061 --> 02:27:28,820
but what's your like,
what's the least ideal situation?

3737
02:27:28,821 --> 02:27:32,480
Much on the tag out a city.
I mean like least ideal is always a late

3738
02:27:32,481 --> 02:27:34,850
show on a Friday night in a place where
people are dumb,

3739
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:36,770
right?
And they're dumb.

3740
02:27:36,771 --> 02:27:39,680
And then if rock,
but I'll tell you what man,

3741
02:27:39,910 --> 02:27:43,610
there is places that you go that don't
get a lot of love and then when you go

3742
02:27:43,611 --> 02:27:45,350
there,
the fucking chills are awesome.

3743
02:27:45,351 --> 02:27:48,560
Like Bakersfield was awesome.
Really just did it.

3744
02:27:48,740 --> 02:27:50,990
Just did it a couple of weeks ago.
It was fucking amazing.

3745
02:27:50,991 --> 02:27:52,010
They were incredible.

3746
02:27:52,190 --> 02:27:54,860
They were one of the,
one of the best audiences ever.

3747
02:27:54,920 --> 02:27:56,870
Lively,
fun by the way.

3748
02:27:56,871 --> 02:27:58,400
Same place to hatch.
Be Mountains.

3749
02:27:58,580 --> 02:28:00,560
That's right near where the guy killed
by a bear.

3750
02:28:01,550 --> 02:28:02,890
There will be blood.
Hi,

3751
02:28:02,900 --> 02:28:05,980
drink your milkshake.
That was right there.

3752
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,540
There was that whole area.
Those people are fucking great.

3753
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:11,120
They were cool.
They were really cool that you were

3754
02:28:11,121 --> 02:28:12,390
surprised.
You sound like you're surprised.

3755
02:28:14,350 --> 02:28:15,560
I'm like,
I got to give it a try.

3756
02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:19,010
I sought and beat burned.
I talked about on a podcast like two

3757
02:28:19,011 --> 02:28:19,611
years ago.
Oh,

3758
02:28:19,611 --> 02:28:22,010
we should do just to of tour of places
where people

3759
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:23,180
don't want to go.
And I'm like,

3760
02:28:23,181 --> 02:28:24,320
yeah,
that'd be kind of fun.

3761
02:28:24,470 --> 02:28:26,660
He and I talked about doing it and we're
going to talk about doing it in

3762
02:28:26,661 --> 02:28:28,970
Bakersfield and we never get around to
doing it.

3763
02:28:29,180 --> 02:28:30,190
And so I said,
ah,

3764
02:28:30,191 --> 02:28:32,360
I'm just gonna go by myself.
So I decided to go.

3765
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:34,910
I had a great fucking time.
It was fun.

3766
02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:37,460
Yeah,
we know those people deserve comedy too.

3767
02:28:37,461 --> 02:28:38,930
Like it's so funny.
It's like big cities.

3768
02:28:39,080 --> 02:28:42,170
That's why when you go somewhere small,
most of the time they appreciate it more

3769
02:28:42,171 --> 02:28:42,681
cause they're like,
dude,

3770
02:28:42,681 --> 02:28:44,600
no one ever comes through here.
You know what else is great?

3771
02:28:44,720 --> 02:28:46,100
Fresno.
Yeah.

3772
02:28:46,101 --> 02:28:47,000
For,
I'd never been there and done.

3773
02:28:47,020 --> 02:28:49,280
That was great.
Fucking fun,

3774
02:28:49,281 --> 02:28:51,440
man.
Did two shows in Fresno had a great

3775
02:28:51,441 --> 02:28:52,670
time.
You have no idea how many people right

3776
02:28:52,671 --> 02:28:57,671
now in fresno and losing their minds.
Know Fresno has some serious soul food,

3777
02:28:58,310 --> 02:29:01,730
some legit shit for real soul food
festivals.

3778
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:03,380
How far?
I wish I could remember the place.

3779
02:29:03,381 --> 02:29:05,120
I got the name of the place somewhere on
my phone.

3780
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:08,450
How far is Fresno from here?
It took a solid four hour drive.

3781
02:29:09,860 --> 02:29:12,410
Yeah.
It's almost a San Francisco,

3782
02:29:12,411 --> 02:29:16,640
right?
I'm a little surprised to an hour and a

3783
02:29:16,640 --> 02:29:17,473
half,
so

3784
02:29:19,010 --> 02:29:22,100
yeah,
it's about about four hours drive.

3785
02:29:22,160 --> 02:29:25,370
I forget the name of this fucking place.
There was a soul food place in Fresno,

3786
02:29:25,390 --> 02:29:29,180
not gonna be able to find it.
See if you can google soul food in

3787
02:29:29,181 --> 02:29:31,670
Fresno.
It's one about the highly ranked rest is

3788
02:29:31,671 --> 02:29:35,390
not a lot of choices in Fresno for food
chef Paul's or dolls kitchen.

3789
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:38,360
I think it's chef Paul's.
Can you see if you can find a picture of

3790
02:29:38,361 --> 02:29:39,530
it?
4.6 yeah,

3791
02:29:39,531 --> 02:29:40,450
that's the spot.
It is.

3792
02:29:40,460 --> 02:29:42,950
Chef Paul's got to be a four point next
baby.

3793
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:44,660
They had dude,
they have oxtails.

3794
02:29:45,020 --> 02:29:46,160
They have love.
I've sale.

3795
02:29:46,310 --> 02:29:49,100
That is the place.
Cool artwork on the wall.

3796
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:52,310
That place,
if you are in a near Fresno,

3797
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:55,400
if you're like an hour outside of Fresno
drive there.

3798
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:57,900
If you're on your way,
you're passing through and you got to

3799
02:29:57,901 --> 02:29:59,690
ask probably not something we,
their little shrimp Gumbo,

3800
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:01,520
dude,
they had chicken and waffles.

3801
02:30:01,521 --> 02:30:03,770
They had ribs.
I had tried tip.

3802
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:07,820
They had a catfish.
I believe they had the,

3803
02:30:07,821 --> 02:30:10,270
but the braised oxtail was all love
sharks.

3804
02:30:10,271 --> 02:30:12,320
Tail man.
So good man.

3805
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:15,710
They had Collard Greens.
That was amazing.

3806
02:30:15,711 --> 02:30:18,380
They had braised cabbage.
That was sensational.

3807
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:21,800
It's a serious joint.
It's one of those places where,

3808
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:23,830
uh,
one of the main things that they serve

3809
02:30:23,831 --> 02:30:26,990
to drink it's Koolaid and I went off the
reservation,

3810
02:30:26,991 --> 02:30:27,621
so I'm like,
fuck it,

3811
02:30:27,621 --> 02:30:30,050
I'm eating this stuff.
I might as well just have a Koolaid as

3812
02:30:30,620 --> 02:30:35,620
it was wonderful having some,
some ribs and a Koolaid.

3813
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:38,270
There's a koolaid right there,
baby.

3814
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:41,480
Having some ribs and a Koolaid.
We went there two days in a row.

3815
02:30:43,140 --> 02:30:44,420
That's credible.
When you go there,

3816
02:30:44,421 --> 02:30:46,160
you can't fucking,
you can't like health it out.

3817
02:30:46,161 --> 02:30:48,310
You got to go.
Go for cog.

3818
02:30:48,770 --> 02:30:51,470
You got to go whole hog.
If you're going to chef Paul's.

3819
02:30:51,590 --> 02:30:55,040
So shout out to chef Paul's cafe in
Fresno.

3820
02:30:55,220 --> 02:30:56,720
Good spot.
But I,

3821
02:30:56,730 --> 02:30:58,260
you know what man,
I'm,

3822
02:30:58,390 --> 02:31:00,620
I'm having a good time doing standup.
So everywhere I'm going,

3823
02:31:00,621 --> 02:31:02,930
I'm having fun.
I mean even when you go to a weird

3824
02:31:02,931 --> 02:31:03,740
place,
it's like,

3825
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:05,210
yeah,
it's weirder.

3826
02:31:05,340 --> 02:31:07,340
I mean it's not Anaheim,
but it's weird.

3827
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:08,570
You know,
it's fun.

3828
02:31:08,990 --> 02:31:11,700
It's not the Irvine Improv,
right,

3829
02:31:11,710 --> 02:31:11,991
right,
right.

3830
02:31:11,991 --> 02:31:12,411
Now,
see,

3831
02:31:12,411 --> 02:31:15,500
I'm at a level where I'm still hustling
through places that are just,

3832
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:17,000
you know,
I'm,

3833
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:20,070
I'm having fun for a lot of places,
but some places I'm just

3834
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:21,750
like,
the crowds are not that good.

3835
02:31:21,751 --> 02:31:23,210
I don't draw enough people.
So it's like,

3836
02:31:23,220 --> 02:31:23,580
uh,
it's,

3837
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:25,500
it's hard.
I think bird talked about it.

3838
02:31:25,530 --> 02:31:29,550
I don't know if he talked about it here,
but he said like killing to the abyss.

3839
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:31,140
He's like,
there's a part in your career when

3840
02:31:31,141 --> 02:31:33,780
you're killing to the abyss,
when you're kinda like,

3841
02:31:34,070 --> 02:31:34,771
you're,
you know,

3842
02:31:34,771 --> 02:31:36,120
you're a pro,
you are a professional,

3843
02:31:36,130 --> 02:31:38,550
you've had accolades in the game,
you've done well enough,

3844
02:31:38,850 --> 02:31:41,760
but your fan base isn't huge enough to
where you have a big following.

3845
02:31:41,761 --> 02:31:44,460
So when you go somewhere,
you crush and you'll hear afterwards

3846
02:31:44,461 --> 02:31:45,510
someone go,
you know,

3847
02:31:45,511 --> 02:31:48,120
I've never even heard of you and we,
you're one of our favorite comics now.

3848
02:31:48,990 --> 02:31:50,460
And they do that.
They do this thing where they're like,

3849
02:31:50,461 --> 02:31:51,760
we fucking love you.
Oh,

3850
02:31:51,780 --> 02:31:54,180
I can't believe we're going to find,
so you make these new fans,

3851
02:31:54,181 --> 02:31:56,070
it's great,
but it's just like you are,

3852
02:31:56,100 --> 02:32:00,030
you are working so hard,
crushing to 30 people to,

3853
02:32:00,100 --> 02:32:00,840
you know,
to earn,

3854
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:01,340
earn,
you know,

3855
02:32:01,340 --> 02:32:03,150
to earn.
You're earning all these audiences.

3856
02:32:03,270 --> 02:32:04,710
Those times though,
man,

3857
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:08,310
when you look back you will remember
those very fondly.

3858
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:10,530
Well I can't forget them cause a lot of
them are painful a shit.

3859
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:13,050
Yeah,
there's going to be rough ones.

3860
02:32:13,051 --> 02:32:16,380
But those are fucking so critical for
the development of your APP.

3861
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:18,300
Oh to it's worth.
It's worth every and the,

3862
02:32:18,320 --> 02:32:19,890
and the other thing is the places that I
have built,

3863
02:32:20,040 --> 02:32:22,080
audiences that I love,
like Denver,

3864
02:32:22,081 --> 02:32:25,070
when I go back to comedy works,
I can sell that plays out because I

3865
02:32:25,090 --> 02:32:26,500
built an audience,
right?

3866
02:32:26,510 --> 02:32:28,950
Like if I build audiences in places that
really loved me,

3867
02:32:28,951 --> 02:32:31,350
that's the best part about going to
places where I'm like,

3868
02:32:31,860 --> 02:32:32,341
you know,
she,

3869
02:32:32,341 --> 02:32:34,380
you know,
they just show me so much love there

3870
02:32:34,381 --> 02:32:34,891
that you're like,
God,

3871
02:32:34,891 --> 02:32:36,150
that's what it is.
That's what it feels good.

3872
02:32:36,640 --> 02:32:38,840
Think of like if you're in a place like
Denver,

3873
02:32:39,230 --> 02:32:42,500
how many of those people that come to
see you are actually going to leave

3874
02:32:42,501 --> 02:32:45,300
comments or tweet at you?
And how many of them are just gonna

3875
02:32:45,320 --> 02:32:47,000
enjoy it?
Because most of the time when I go to

3876
02:32:47,001 --> 02:32:49,830
see somebody I just enjoy.
I just enjoy it too.

3877
02:32:50,660 --> 02:32:52,370
It's very rare that I say,
hey,

3878
02:32:52,371 --> 02:32:54,080
you have to go see this guy.
Hey,

3879
02:32:54,081 --> 02:32:56,720
this girl's here or this band or
whatever it is.

3880
02:32:56,721 --> 02:32:57,680
It's very rare,
right?

3881
02:32:57,810 --> 02:33:01,310
Most of the time I just enjoy it.
So like you think about you're doing

3882
02:33:01,311 --> 02:33:02,510
thousands of people,
right?

3883
02:33:02,511 --> 02:33:05,570
You're doing 200 was at 300 seats.
How much just,

3884
02:33:06,110 --> 02:33:10,040
yeah,
so like 300 seats you doing 1200 in the

3885
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:11,330
two days,
you know,

3886
02:33:11,331 --> 02:33:13,610
and then you're going back again,
do another 12 they'll tell their

3887
02:33:13,611 --> 02:33:14,870
friends,
people come back,

3888
02:33:15,080 --> 02:33:17,750
tickets go quicker next time,
and then a year later.

3889
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:20,510
I mean that's,
that's the key to building the road.

3890
02:33:20,511 --> 02:33:22,970
Like to this day,
there's places where I sell out wayne

3891
02:33:22,971 --> 02:33:26,030
advance and there's other places where I
haven't really haven't been going that

3892
02:33:26,031 --> 02:33:28,670
often.
And it's more of a difficulty to sell

3893
02:33:28,671 --> 02:33:33,671
tickets because you've built up a yeah,
I mean how Austin Houston's a spot where

3894
02:33:34,581 --> 02:33:36,620
I could just,
I sell on Houston.

3895
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:40,400
I've been selling out comedy clubs in
Houston since the 90s yeah.

3896
02:33:40,401 --> 02:33:42,230
It's like,
it's always been a spot that I could

3897
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:44,630
cause that was like for me,
Houston was one of the,

3898
02:33:44,631 --> 02:33:48,710
there was a few cities where legends
came from and Houston was wearing,

3899
02:33:48,711 --> 02:33:52,700
Kennison came from and for me it's like
Kennison and Hex Bolt came out of

3900
02:33:52,701 --> 02:33:55,040
Houston.
So for me it's like I had to get to

3901
02:33:55,041 --> 02:33:57,770
Houston and like there's this thought in
my head like I knew about the laugh stop

3902
02:33:57,771 --> 02:33:59,240
and river oaks.
It's one spot.

3903
02:33:59,390 --> 02:34:01,190
There was the nineties I got,
I got to get to that club.

3904
02:34:01,430 --> 02:34:02,570
Like that's the spot,
right.

3905
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:05,500
There's a fucking perfect comedy club to
you.

3906
02:34:05,540 --> 02:34:06,740
You never worked there,
Huh?

3907
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:08,210
Who's gone before he came around?

3908
02:34:08,240 --> 02:34:09,020
I was going to say,
but I've,

3909
02:34:09,020 --> 02:34:12,430
but I've listened to many albums where
they are at the laugh stop introducing

3910
02:34:12,490 --> 02:34:14,480
comic mind from 1999.
Yeah,

3911
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:16,810
I'm from,
I'm going to be dead.

3912
02:34:16,811 --> 02:34:19,600
Some Warner brothers.
That was from the last stop.

3913
02:34:19,601 --> 02:34:22,720
I did it in Houston.
I filmed in like a recorded it rather 98

3914
02:34:22,721 --> 02:34:25,900
or 99 and it was um,
the perfect club.

3915
02:34:25,990 --> 02:34:27,790
It was perfect.
They had an open mic night,

3916
02:34:27,791 --> 02:34:29,950
so they had a bar in the front and they
had stage in the,

3917
02:34:29,951 --> 02:34:32,080
in the front and they had open Mike
night.

3918
02:34:32,081 --> 02:34:35,020
They would start at eight and go two
o'clock in the fucking morning and no

3919
02:34:35,021 --> 02:34:36,460
hacks.
I'm telling you know,

3920
02:34:36,461 --> 02:34:40,000
hacks and they would ostracize hacks,
boot him out of the community.

3921
02:34:40,090 --> 02:34:42,820
They're all artists.
There was a lot of really good comics

3922
02:34:42,821 --> 02:34:43,930
that came out of that.
It's wild.

3923
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:47,590
And one club went under,
this one club went under and the whole

3924
02:34:47,591 --> 02:34:51,100
scene took a big hit.
Apparently the scenes bouncing back now

3925
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:53,410
and there's,
there's a lot more comics now in

3926
02:34:53,411 --> 02:34:54,850
Houston,
but dude,

3927
02:34:54,851 --> 02:34:59,200
when I used to work there in the 90s you
would go there and these opening acts,

3928
02:34:59,201 --> 02:35:01,510
these guys who were working there would
be fucking killers.

3929
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:03,160
They were killed.
Hers would rip.

3930
02:35:03,280 --> 02:35:05,170
They were great.
They were real comics.

3931
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,650
There were real comics and then the open
Mike night you would see funny comics

3932
02:35:08,651 --> 02:35:11,380
that were learning how to do comedy,
like people that really have shot,

3933
02:35:12,010 --> 02:35:17,010
but it was just one club.
That's always a problem when there's one

3934
02:35:17,891 --> 02:35:20,530
club in a town.
Wendy's figured out how to do that in

3935
02:35:20,531 --> 02:35:22,570
Denver,
like that's what Wendy who owns the

3936
02:35:22,571 --> 02:35:24,460
comedy works.
She's figured out,

3937
02:35:24,461 --> 02:35:28,510
she's created a scene like that.
That scene is almost primarily

3938
02:35:28,511 --> 02:35:33,130
responsible or she's almost primarily
responsible or or or as one individual

3939
02:35:33,131 --> 02:35:34,660
for that entire comedy scene.
Yeah,

3940
02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:36,490
she's amazing.
Well she's called.

3941
02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:41,560
I give her credit because I think she's
cultivated such good talent that that

3942
02:35:42,041 --> 02:35:43,240
again,
that's kind of what you were saying

3943
02:35:43,241 --> 02:35:44,980
about Houston.
Like everyone that I know that I met

3944
02:35:44,981 --> 02:35:46,030
there,
that's from there.

3945
02:35:46,160 --> 02:35:49,540
It comes out of there is,
is a fucking phenomenal comedian.

3946
02:35:49,560 --> 02:35:52,350
Right?
Like they're like they're locals are

3947
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:55,810
professionals here.
To this day when I do comedy,

3948
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:57,780
like a do theaters,
they're like,

3949
02:35:57,790 --> 02:35:59,080
I'll do this.
The Belko,

3950
02:35:59,081 --> 02:36:01,330
it's like 5,000 seats.
I go through her,

3951
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:04,210
I do it through her and I,
she also do her club,

3952
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:06,670
so I always hang out with her when I'm
in town.

3953
02:36:06,671 --> 02:36:09,480
Like that lady's super important.
Yeah.

3954
02:36:09,580 --> 02:36:14,420
Like I did my special there in 2014 my
comedy central special because I like,

3955
02:36:14,460 --> 02:36:16,060
it was important to me to do it at that
club.

3956
02:36:16,780 --> 02:36:19,510
That club was one of the reasons why I
moved to Colorado for a brief time.

3957
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:20,501
I was like,
this,

3958
02:36:20,501 --> 02:36:22,480
I'll be close to this club.
It was like I can,

3959
02:36:22,481 --> 02:36:25,150
I can survive here.
Like I need a pay station.

3960
02:36:25,390 --> 02:36:27,460
I need a base station to fuck around and
workout material.

3961
02:36:27,461 --> 02:36:29,290
I could use this place like everybody
else is doing it.

3962
02:36:29,470 --> 02:36:30,290
Like I could,
I could.

3963
02:36:30,290 --> 02:36:32,170
This could be a,
this is a real comedy community.

3964
02:36:32,290 --> 02:36:33,520
It really is.
Yeah.

3965
02:36:33,521 --> 02:36:35,650
There's a few like that that are
building so strong right now.

3966
02:36:35,651 --> 02:36:39,370
I think my only fear for the future is
there's a lot of new clubs that pop up

3967
02:36:39,371 --> 02:36:43,150
and a lot of clubs that have gone so
corporatized that they're all the same.

3968
02:36:43,220 --> 02:36:45,400
Then I'm still a club guy.
So for me,

3969
02:36:45,820 --> 02:36:47,470
I don't get to play theaters,
you know?

3970
02:36:47,530 --> 02:36:48,970
So when you do clubs,
you're,

3971
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:52,450
you know,
at the mercy of the club system of

3972
02:36:52,451 --> 02:36:53,620
whatever that may be,
you know,

3973
02:36:53,680 --> 02:36:57,040
and a lot of them are,
a lot of them are so corporately

3974
02:36:57,041 --> 02:36:57,821
systematic.
I mean,

3975
02:36:57,821 --> 02:36:58,480
you feel like,
you're like,

3976
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:00,380
sometimes you feel like,
you know the old joke of a musician

3977
02:37:00,390 --> 02:37:01,450
psych,
what's up Omaha?

3978
02:37:01,451 --> 02:37:02,140
And they're like,
what?

3979
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:03,940
This is no Mas Missouri?
And you're like,

3980
02:37:04,720 --> 02:37:06,340
well,
it all feels the same.

3981
02:37:06,400 --> 02:37:10,420
Like some of the clubs feel the same.
That's true with a lot of the Improv's.

3982
02:37:10,840 --> 02:37:14,260
But what they've done is they figured
out a way to make it a very professional

3983
02:37:14,261 --> 02:37:16,310
experience.
Everywhere you go all over the country.

3984
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:19,130
Yeah.
Like I accept what they're doing because

3985
02:37:19,131 --> 02:37:21,890
what they're doing is like a blend of
the art and commerce.

3986
02:37:22,520 --> 02:37:25,310
They've done a smart thing,
but they don't fuck with your act.

3987
02:37:25,390 --> 02:37:27,170
No.
As long as they don't fuck with my act,

3988
02:37:27,171 --> 02:37:27,931
I'm cool.
And it's all,

3989
02:37:27,931 --> 02:37:29,690
it was their professional and friendly.
I'm cool.

3990
02:37:29,691 --> 02:37:32,210
But there's a big difference between
working for them and like working for

3991
02:37:32,211 --> 02:37:35,330
[inaudible] in Nashville.
It's like owned by,

3992
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:37,490
you know,
guys have owned it for a long time.

3993
02:37:37,510 --> 02:37:39,270
It's a super sweet club,
you know,

3994
02:37:39,950 --> 02:37:42,530
it just great guys.
It's just,

3995
02:37:42,531 --> 02:37:44,300
and it's a perfect old school.
You know,

3996
02:37:44,301 --> 02:37:47,470
it's an old school comedy club because
you walk around and look at the headshot

3997
02:37:47,510 --> 02:37:48,101
to go,
is he,

3998
02:37:48,101 --> 02:37:49,970
he's dead now.
He killed himself.

3999
02:37:50,490 --> 02:37:52,990
Then he died.
How many dead people that are at a lot,

4000
02:37:52,991 --> 02:37:54,020
man,
a lot.

4001
02:37:54,350 --> 02:37:57,020
That's like the comedy store is like a
posture Miss Hallway when he walked into

4002
02:37:57,021 --> 02:37:58,280
his,
everybody on the world is dead.

4003
02:37:58,460 --> 02:38:01,100
It's true.
Roseanne might be the only big picture

4004
02:38:01,101 --> 02:38:02,660
in the hallway that's still alive.
Well,

4005
02:38:02,661 --> 02:38:06,530
there's one wall when you get out of the
kitchen and you go towards the main

4006
02:38:06,531 --> 02:38:07,400
road.
If you took a right,

4007
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:09,740
yeah,
that one wall three out of the four

4008
02:38:09,741 --> 02:38:10,760
people are dead.
Yeah.

4009
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,220
That's what I mean.
Like it's like Rosangela one.

4010
02:38:13,221 --> 02:38:14,720
That's a lie.
That's on that side of the wall,

4011
02:38:14,721 --> 02:38:16,160
I think.
No,

4012
02:38:16,161 --> 02:38:18,200
I think it's Louie Anderson.
Oh yeah,

4013
02:38:18,201 --> 02:38:18,711
you're right.
No,

4014
02:38:18,711 --> 02:38:19,251
you're right.
You're right.

4015
02:38:19,251 --> 02:38:22,280
You're only Anderson's alive.
Robin Williams is dead.

4016
02:38:23,480 --> 02:38:24,920
Surely.
Hemphill's dead.

4017
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:26,870
Yup.
Um,

4018
02:38:26,990 --> 02:38:29,480
Richard Pryor's dead and Garry
shandling's death.

4019
02:38:29,510 --> 02:38:31,260
Shandling's Acessa shitty one.
I,

4020
02:38:31,261 --> 02:38:33,170
I'm held that she,
she has a big picture.

4021
02:38:33,171 --> 02:38:35,400
Is She on the wall?
I think she's not a big picture as a

4022
02:38:35,401 --> 02:38:36,620
smaller,
smaller on the wall.

4023
02:38:36,680 --> 02:38:38,330
Yeah,
there's a lot of them,

4024
02:38:38,331 --> 02:38:40,310
dude.
Yeah,

4025
02:38:40,311 --> 02:38:41,480
it's wild.
Yeah.

4026
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:43,970
Early last Craig motherfucking Mac
today.

4027
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:46,940
All right.
P Craig Mac flavor.

4028
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:48,440
New Year.
You were the best.

4029
02:38:49,390 --> 02:38:50,570
Um,
where you get it.

4030
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:53,300
Where are you going to next?
I'm finishing up shooting the second

4031
02:38:53,301 --> 02:38:54,740
season of,
I'm dying up here for showtime,

4032
02:38:54,741 --> 02:38:58,360
so I'm here in town doing that once it
started here.

4033
02:38:59,190 --> 02:39:00,650
Are you happy with it?
Everything's going well.

4034
02:39:00,930 --> 02:39:03,110
Smooth.
We added Brad Garrett who's on and who's

4035
02:39:03,120 --> 02:39:04,270
crazy.
Bread's good dude.

4036
02:39:04,340 --> 02:39:05,810
He's great.
Such a cool guy.

4037
02:39:05,960 --> 02:39:08,060
He's a great guy.
He's got the Best Club in Vegas.

4038
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:09,380
Yeah.
And you know what's so funny,

4039
02:39:09,381 --> 02:39:10,390
man,
it's great to sit down and talk,

4040
02:39:10,391 --> 02:39:12,410
talking stories about,
stand up with him cause he's been around

4041
02:39:12,411 --> 02:39:13,280
for so long.
He knows.

4042
02:39:13,340 --> 02:39:15,920
I mean,
he's got such good gold of stuff I can't

4043
02:39:15,921 --> 02:39:16,850
talk about.
It's like I,

4044
02:39:16,851 --> 02:39:19,100
I want him to tell him like,
I don't want to tell any histories.

4045
02:39:19,150 --> 02:39:20,260
But she was a guy.

4046
02:39:22,590 --> 02:39:24,380
Craziest voice.
A real voice.

4047
02:39:24,410 --> 02:39:26,810
Very deep.
But he a great guy.

4048
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:27,620
Awesome dude.
We,

4049
02:39:27,620 --> 02:39:29,720
they added him and they added this,
a young actress.

4050
02:39:29,860 --> 02:39:31,550
Xhosa.
Rockmore who fucking fuck her.

4051
02:39:32,830 --> 02:39:34,190
I'm just kidding.
I don't even know who that is.

4052
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:35,420
She's Black Joe.
Is that why?

4053
02:39:35,421 --> 02:39:36,810
Cause she's black.
I wouldn't have said it.

4054
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:38,180
No.
Yeah.

4055
02:39:38,180 --> 02:39:40,700
So we come out may six.
So now I'm shooting in town.

4056
02:39:40,730 --> 02:39:44,450
Next weekend I'm gonna go with you.
We're going to fuck around factory or

4057
02:39:44,451 --> 02:39:45,940

4058
02:39:45,980 --> 02:39:47,810
Nice House.
Nice House.

4059
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,220
There's so many clubs.
Uh,

4060
02:39:49,221 --> 02:39:51,410
yeah,
we're doing the ICEHOUSE Stena next

4061
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:53,090
Friday and Saturday.
It's all sold out.

4062
02:39:53,120 --> 02:39:54,080
Fuckers.
Sorry.

4063
02:39:54,170 --> 02:39:56,120
Sorry.
But otherwise when I get back on the

4064
02:39:56,121 --> 02:39:57,710
road at the end of May to the first
dates,

4065
02:39:57,711 --> 02:39:59,420
I'll be doing a,
I go back up to,

4066
02:39:59,421 --> 02:40:01,520
I go up to Alberta while we were talking
about,

4067
02:40:01,521 --> 02:40:04,100
I go to Edmonton,
so I'll be in Edmonton the end of May.

4068
02:40:04,130 --> 02:40:07,220
So look on net Edmondton calendar.
I'll be up there.

4069
02:40:07,221 --> 02:40:08,960
Uh,

4070
02:40:08,990 --> 02:40:11,120
I'm doing house accommodate.
That place is great.

4071
02:40:11,121 --> 02:40:11,660
Yeah,
it's fun.

4072
02:40:11,660 --> 02:40:13,040
That's great family.
That's a,

4073
02:40:13,110 --> 02:40:14,070
that's an all time

4074
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:15,630
great club.
It's really,

4075
02:40:15,631 --> 02:40:16,350
really fun.
Yeah.

4076
02:40:16,350 --> 02:40:17,510
And the family that runs it,
they're,

4077
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:19,230
they're the Bronson's are great.
They're good to me.

4078
02:40:19,231 --> 02:40:21,120
So I love them now and raves about that
place.

4079
02:40:21,150 --> 02:40:21,630
Yeah,
I know.

4080
02:40:21,630 --> 02:40:22,790
They love him.
They love him and,

4081
02:40:22,791 --> 02:40:23,660
and,
and they,

4082
02:40:23,700 --> 02:40:24,540
they like,
they like,

4083
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:27,060
they like a lot of store guys.
It's just by coincidence.

4084
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:29,070
Like Bobby,
they love a lot of funny comics.

4085
02:40:29,420 --> 02:40:31,080
They're like funny people.
Triple.

4086
02:40:31,250 --> 02:40:33,450
He did his cd there.
Yeah.

4087
02:40:33,451 --> 02:40:34,284
Recorded there.
Yeah.

4088
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:35,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

4089
02:40:35,110 --> 02:40:36,400
That's a great spot.
Don.

4090
02:40:36,410 --> 02:40:39,570
My rarer raves about that.
Brad Garret Club at the MGM.

4091
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:40,080
Oh yeah.
It's like,

4092
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:42,260
it's the best club we own.
Dom Dom is on,

4093
02:40:42,270 --> 02:40:44,940
I'm dying up here and this actually
happened this last week.

4094
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:48,180
Uh,
dom had a scene in the show where he

4095
02:40:48,370 --> 02:40:51,840
like has a heart attack and uh,
you know,

4096
02:40:51,841 --> 02:40:53,460
he gets on a plane to go to Jersey or
something.

4097
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:57,470
He flans there's like six missed phone
calls from Mark Marin and mark leaves

4098
02:40:57,471 --> 02:40:58,560
and voicemails being like,
hey man,

4099
02:40:58,561 --> 02:41:00,270
I heard something happened on set.
Cause you know,

4100
02:41:00,540 --> 02:41:03,390
like the game of telephone got out that
it was like someone said,

4101
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:04,460
yeah,
that was done in a senior.

4102
02:41:04,461 --> 02:41:05,281
He had a heart attack.
So it was like,

4103
02:41:05,281 --> 02:41:05,581
wait,
what?

4104
02:41:05,581 --> 02:41:07,950
Tom had a one on it and it just bled out
into the ether,

4105
02:41:07,951 --> 02:41:09,120
you know,
so,

4106
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:11,040
so dom called me,
he's like,

4107
02:41:11,230 --> 02:41:13,110
Hey Andrew,
I got to tell you people think I'm dead.

4108
02:41:13,140 --> 02:41:15,510
Did you who told people that I died on
set?

4109
02:41:15,511 --> 02:41:16,350
And I'm like,
I don't know man.

4110
02:41:16,351 --> 02:41:18,510
Maybe it'll give you some traction.
So let it keep going.

4111
02:41:19,050 --> 02:41:20,910
Keep subtraction.
Isn't that funny?

4112
02:41:20,911 --> 02:41:22,500
Maybe it'll go viral.
Fuck it.

4113
02:41:22,530 --> 02:41:23,730
You never know bro.
Dot.

4114
02:41:23,880 --> 02:41:25,710
Viral.
But Dom is the best man we've had.

4115
02:41:26,190 --> 02:41:27,330
He's awesome.
He's the best.

4116
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:29,150
We've had some good comics pop up.
We're going to keep there.

4117
02:41:29,220 --> 02:41:32,370
They keep getting more cow.
Andy kindler came on the show.

4118
02:41:32,700 --> 02:41:35,550
Um,
fucking Rick Overton is back on the

4119
02:41:35,551 --> 02:41:36,840
show.
There's like a lot of great,

4120
02:41:37,530 --> 02:41:39,770
a lot of great people.
I became friends with dom cause we,

4121
02:41:39,771 --> 02:41:41,700
we hung out in a pool hall once.
Okay.

4122
02:41:41,750 --> 02:41:42,990
Yeah,
we did a Gig together,

4123
02:41:42,991 --> 02:41:45,480
but I didn't really know him.
And then I went to Amsterdam billiards

4124
02:41:45,481 --> 02:41:50,100
in New York and like
90 somewhere in the 90s and a,

4125
02:41:50,101 --> 02:41:53,100
I used to play a lot of pool and I was
there and Dama rare was there with his

4126
02:41:53,101 --> 02:41:54,360
own stick.
I was like,

4127
02:41:54,361 --> 02:41:56,520
what do you play pool?
He's like,

4128
02:41:56,521 --> 02:41:57,420
yeah,
he's pretty good.

4129
02:41:57,421 --> 02:41:58,080
I was like,
Shit,

4130
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,960
let's play some pool.
And we played pool.

4131
02:41:59,961 --> 02:42:01,670
It's like,
I can't believe I fucking love him.

4132
02:42:01,690 --> 02:42:04,170
Play some real pool.
That's from Philadelphia.

4133
02:42:04,440 --> 02:42:06,020
From Philadelphia.
You've gotta be able to take a punch to

4134
02:42:06,021 --> 02:42:07,830
tell a joke and play some pool.
That's it.

4135
02:42:08,070 --> 02:42:09,900
You have to have the end know where the
good cheese sticks are.

4136
02:42:10,080 --> 02:42:10,770
Right,
right,

4137
02:42:10,770 --> 02:42:13,050
right.
Do you think that's Philadelphia people

4138
02:42:13,051 --> 02:42:15,710
like enough with the fucking chase day?
No,

4139
02:42:15,750 --> 02:42:18,180
they love it.
It's part of their fucking culture.

4140
02:42:18,270 --> 02:42:19,680
But you don't think they're annoyed
like,

4141
02:42:19,710 --> 02:42:20,491
oh,
you're saying that.

4142
02:42:20,491 --> 02:42:22,740
That's all we have.
And partially it is.

4143
02:42:22,770 --> 02:42:24,090
What are their food is coming out of
there?

4144
02:42:24,180 --> 02:42:25,140
Is anybody else being like,
dude,

4145
02:42:25,141 --> 02:42:26,230
you know what else is good out of
Philly?

4146
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:28,230
Very good Italian food.
They have been as good at,

4147
02:42:28,240 --> 02:42:29,790
that's like Boston,
good Italian food,

4148
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:32,250
New York.
I think Boston has some of the best of

4149
02:42:32,251 --> 02:42:33,210
talent.
If we go to the north end,

4150
02:42:33,211 --> 02:42:34,590
that's not true.
Oh yeah.

4151
02:42:34,591 --> 02:42:37,770
I have good Italian food that you can't
fuck with New York.

4152
02:42:37,770 --> 02:42:38,880
I grew up there.
Trust me.

4153
02:42:39,250 --> 02:42:41,340
One of the same New York,
Boston to me.

4154
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:43,230
No,
you don't think he could fuck with it.

4155
02:42:43,380 --> 02:42:44,220
Sorry.
Boston.

4156
02:42:44,590 --> 02:42:45,930
Like I love Ya.
I love Ya.

4157
02:42:45,990 --> 02:42:49,380
But I think there's a smaller amount of
good places.

4158
02:42:49,381 --> 02:42:52,590
Whereas New York,
there's an endless supply per capita.

4159
02:42:52,591 --> 02:42:56,370
It's fucking yes.
Supply of flour on the floor and fucking

4160
02:42:56,371 --> 02:43:00,720
people with aprons and making sure,
oh fucking sauce.

4161
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:02,940
My own shot shade shed.
It's just,

4162
02:43:02,941 --> 02:43:04,770
uh,
I feel like there's a larger

4163
02:43:04,771 --> 02:43:07,230
concentration of guineas in like the New
York,

4164
02:43:07,231 --> 02:43:09,930
New Jersey area.
And in Boston it was more of a

4165
02:43:09,931 --> 02:43:12,130
concentration of Irish.
There was more Irish,

4166
02:43:12,150 --> 02:43:12,971
Irish.
Yeah,

4167
02:43:12,971 --> 02:43:16,440
I was just a few Italian,
but they were heavily out numbers like

4168
02:43:16,480 --> 02:43:17,660
East Boston,
you know,

4169
02:43:17,661 --> 02:43:19,600
like a few places,
little Italy,

4170
02:43:19,860 --> 02:43:22,360
few places where I feel comfortable with
it because I'm an orange guy.

4171
02:43:22,390 --> 02:43:24,270
When I go to Boston,
people think I'm more than just slipped

4172
02:43:24,271 --> 02:43:26,060
right in.
They assume I'm there.

4173
02:43:26,200 --> 02:43:27,033
Well,
what are you,

4174
02:43:27,250 --> 02:43:28,570
Irish and Italian who was,
hey,

4175
02:43:28,571 --> 02:43:29,680
you're one of theirs.
Yeah,

4176
02:43:29,681 --> 02:43:32,920
but not one of their Sam Tino.
They hear Santina Santina they get mad.

4177
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:34,600
What?
We'll try to this.

4178
02:43:35,380 --> 02:43:36,700
Yeah.
When I first moved to Boston,

4179
02:43:36,701 --> 02:43:38,680
I had an Irish last name,
the opposite,

4180
02:43:38,710 --> 02:43:40,870
but I'm mostly Italian.
I'm three quarters Italian where you

4181
02:43:40,890 --> 02:43:42,440
look it.
So it's like,

4182
02:43:42,450 --> 02:43:42,910
uh,
like,

4183
02:43:42,910 --> 02:43:43,743
Whoa,
wait,

4184
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:46,480
you got fucking Irish last name and
you're almost all Italian.

4185
02:43:46,750 --> 02:43:48,220
Fucking shame.
Fuck it.

4186
02:43:48,221 --> 02:43:49,240
Fuck that.
Shame.

4187
02:43:49,630 --> 02:43:54,630
There's some real Irish versus Italian
animosity in Boston and like the in most

4188
02:43:55,061 --> 02:43:57,370
cities,
late seventies early eighties when I

4189
02:43:57,371 --> 02:43:59,200
first moved there,
I was going to say like the history of

4190
02:43:59,201 --> 02:43:59,890
Irish and Italian.

4191
02:43:59,890 --> 02:44:01,440
They didn't fuck,
they didn't really get along too well.

4192
02:44:01,450 --> 02:44:06,450
I did not think I moved there in,
it must've been like 79 79 and then I

4193
02:44:08,621 --> 02:44:11,860
went to high school there in 81 that was
my first year in high school.

4194
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:13,690
Where were you born?
I was born in New Jersey.

4195
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:16,390
I was gonna say I thought Jersey,
but we lived in California for a while.

4196
02:44:16,420 --> 02:44:20,410
I lived in California from age seven to
11 and then we lived in Florida for a

4197
02:44:20,411 --> 02:44:24,940
little bit and then we lived in Boston
and Jamaica plain for a year and a half,

4198
02:44:24,941 --> 02:44:25,960
two years,
somewhere in there.

4199
02:44:26,170 --> 02:44:28,270
And then we moved to Newton,
which is a very nice suburb.

4200
02:44:29,170 --> 02:44:31,270
Upper falls for a nice,
I was fancy.

4201
02:44:31,540 --> 02:44:34,570
It's very quiet.
There's a lot of big lawns.

4202
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:38,410
Everybody's relaxed fences.
People born out of their fucking mind.

4203
02:44:38,411 --> 02:44:40,090
Can't wait to escape,
you know,

4204
02:44:40,091 --> 02:44:40,810
it's one of those places.

4205
02:44:40,810 --> 02:44:42,400
Don't realize how good they have it.
Well,

4206
02:44:42,401 --> 02:44:44,170
that's what happens.
I went back recently,

4207
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:45,310
I drove through the streets.
I'm like,

4208
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:46,840
Jack could live here.
It's fucking places.

4209
02:44:46,841 --> 02:44:47,561
Great.
Well,

4210
02:44:47,561 --> 02:44:48,730
you have a new perspective.
When you get older,

4211
02:44:48,731 --> 02:44:49,361
when you're younger,
you're like,

4212
02:44:49,361 --> 02:44:51,700
get the fuck out of the shade hole.
Well,

4213
02:44:51,701 --> 02:44:54,370
when you're younger,
you just so filled with angst.

4214
02:44:54,750 --> 02:44:56,320
He just like,
you have no idea.

4215
02:44:56,380 --> 02:44:59,080
Like think about this.
When you were 17 you had no idea you're

4216
02:44:59,081 --> 02:45:00,700
going to be a professional comic.
No idea.

4217
02:45:00,701 --> 02:45:02,980
Things going to work out.
You're going to be on a TV series,

4218
02:45:03,280 --> 02:45:05,410
going to be having a good time.
He had no idea.

4219
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:06,460
So he just like,
Whoa,

4220
02:45:06,700 --> 02:45:08,680
what if it doesn't?
What if it all goes wrong?

4221
02:45:09,380 --> 02:45:11,830
You see all these people around you and
this guy's always drunk and he's doing

4222
02:45:11,831 --> 02:45:12,331
coke.
I got,

4223
02:45:12,331 --> 02:45:13,540
he thought,
fuck Outta here.

4224
02:45:13,660 --> 02:45:16,870
I gotta get the fuck out of this town.
The fuck away from these people.

4225
02:45:17,350 --> 02:45:19,390
And then you go back when you're an
adult and you go,

4226
02:45:19,391 --> 02:45:22,240
this is a great place.
I grew up in a really nice town.

4227
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:25,640
It was probably only because when you
leave it's nice to come back.

4228
02:45:25,641 --> 02:45:27,220
Oh,
I didn't have anybody telling me it was

4229
02:45:27,221 --> 02:45:28,210
awesome.
Five,

4230
02:45:28,230 --> 02:45:30,160
like a smart older brother.
They'd be like,

4231
02:45:30,161 --> 02:45:30,994
Dude,
look,

4232
02:45:31,310 --> 02:45:33,430
here's the Catholic school.
Girls are all horny.

4233
02:45:33,460 --> 02:45:35,950
They're all right there.
They just wait outside in front of the

4234
02:45:35,951 --> 02:45:37,480
school.
I would have had strategies,

4235
02:45:37,990 --> 02:45:40,570
dude.
There was no one that was hornier than

4236
02:45:40,571 --> 02:45:43,200
the girls who went to Catholic school.
No one.

4237
02:45:43,400 --> 02:45:44,590
No one.
Yeah,

4238
02:45:44,710 --> 02:45:48,100
they separated those girls from boys and
they were a different animal than the

4239
02:45:48,101 --> 02:45:49,870
girls I went to school with freaks.
Yeah.

4240
02:45:49,871 --> 02:45:53,200
I went to public school.
I went to Newton South and uh,

4241
02:45:53,260 --> 02:45:58,150
when we were in high school we would get
out and we would meet girls that were

4242
02:45:58,151 --> 02:46:00,280
coming off of the Catholic girls school.

4243
02:46:00,580 --> 02:46:05,260
These girls would go after guys.
They weren't like regular girls.

4244
02:46:05,280 --> 02:46:07,030
Like it's hunger games.
Predator.

4245
02:46:07,530 --> 02:46:10,130
Like they were starving.
They needed water.

4246
02:46:10,210 --> 02:46:12,080
Dick,
it was crazy.

4247
02:46:12,230 --> 02:46:14,650
The horniest girl I ever dated when I
was young,

4248
02:46:14,670 --> 02:46:17,120
went to,
was in an all girl Catholic school.

4249
02:46:17,150 --> 02:46:19,940
She was a great gal who was a fuck
machine cause she was like made a joke

4250
02:46:19,941 --> 02:46:24,470
about her that like you could,
you could roll a dick passed her like a

4251
02:46:24,471 --> 02:46:26,990
kitten with a ball of yarn and she would
just,

4252
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:31,820
she couldn't help it.
She wasn't a bad person,

4253
02:46:32,030 --> 02:46:37,030
but she was always horny and it took me
years to figure out what was going on.

4254
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:40,820
It was something that I really
considered in a very strange way.

4255
02:46:40,821 --> 02:46:41,654
Okay.
I had a,

4256
02:46:41,980 --> 02:46:44,660
I,
it really puzzled me because I had these

4257
02:46:44,750 --> 02:46:47,000
preconceived notions about how women
behave,

4258
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:51,050
but these Catholic school girls through
a giant monkey wrench into this notion

4259
02:46:51,051 --> 02:46:51,884
like,
okay,

4260
02:46:52,130 --> 02:46:53,780
that makes sense for the regular girls.

4261
02:46:53,870 --> 02:46:55,700
Regular girls,
they might let you know.

4262
02:46:55,701 --> 02:46:58,160
They think you're cute.
He seems nice.

4263
02:46:58,161 --> 02:46:59,570
You,
you ask around,

4264
02:46:59,770 --> 02:47:01,730
you ask a friend to ask her if she likes
me.

4265
02:47:01,850 --> 02:47:02,990
And you know,
there was like this little thing,

4266
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:05,000
those Catholic girls,
they would cut to the chase.

4267
02:47:05,001 --> 02:47:08,110
They were like werewolves.
They would just charge to the room and

4268
02:47:08,220 --> 02:47:09,200
grab a guy,
hey,

4269
02:47:09,201 --> 02:47:11,420
how are you want to make out?
Next thing you know,

4270
02:47:11,421 --> 02:47:13,790
you're fingering them.
They were crazy.

4271
02:47:13,940 --> 02:47:15,780
It was,
there were a totally different animal,

4272
02:47:15,781 --> 02:47:18,470
your hand and putting it down their
pants and girls didn't like it.

4273
02:47:18,770 --> 02:47:20,600
Other girls,
the regular girls did not like,

4274
02:47:20,840 --> 02:47:23,330
they were like gang members.
They're like gang members.

4275
02:47:23,331 --> 02:47:25,970
They all had their own uniform.
They come over with their fucking plaid

4276
02:47:25,971 --> 02:47:29,690
skirts on and just fuck everything.
Like the Tasmanian Devil.

4277
02:47:29,840 --> 02:47:33,680
They would just tornado fucking the
whole of the school and they prayed on

4278
02:47:33,681 --> 02:47:36,620
these boys because they didn't have any,
they had no boys.

4279
02:47:36,890 --> 02:47:39,090
They're in a whole school.
The hundreds of girls when you were

4280
02:47:39,091 --> 02:47:40,640
oppressed,
that that's what you get,

4281
02:47:40,641 --> 02:47:42,410
dude,
that is not good.

4282
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,850
When you take away human emotion like
that,

4283
02:47:43,851 --> 02:47:46,520
you're fucked.
All they're doing is just all day math,

4284
02:47:46,521 --> 02:47:47,540
science,
Spanish,

4285
02:47:47,541 --> 02:47:47,901
Dik,
dik,

4286
02:47:47,901 --> 02:47:50,980
dik dik dik dik dik just run it to the
ticker tape of Dixon.

4287
02:47:50,981 --> 02:47:53,750
Just going through their head and Tj's
and boners.

4288
02:47:53,751 --> 02:47:54,800
It's Squirt,
squirt,

4289
02:47:54,801 --> 02:47:56,570
squirt.
Just thinking about so on,

4290
02:47:56,580 --> 02:47:58,460
sucking her titties and eating their
box.

4291
02:47:58,461 --> 02:48:01,010
That's all they're thinking about.
That's all they thought about.

4292
02:48:01,550 --> 02:48:03,110
I mean,
I really like for that.

4293
02:48:03,111 --> 02:48:05,930
For years.
That girl fucked me up because I had all

4294
02:48:05,931 --> 02:48:10,820
these ideas about like a spectrum of
natural female sexuality,

4295
02:48:11,120 --> 02:48:14,030
like this girl's Hornier than that girl,
but this girl was wanting to do than

4296
02:48:14,031 --> 02:48:15,920
that girl,
and she really likes this,

4297
02:48:15,921 --> 02:48:17,990
but she really likes that.
But most of them,

4298
02:48:17,991 --> 02:48:19,010
they act like girls.

4299
02:48:19,010 --> 02:48:23,240
You've got to let them know that not
this bitch off the charts rabid.

4300
02:48:23,930 --> 02:48:26,570
She was rabid,
rabid.

4301
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:29,450
They suppress the shit out of her.
They just left her in this fucking

4302
02:48:29,451 --> 02:48:31,490
thing.
It was crazy.

4303
02:48:31,760 --> 02:48:34,130
Meanwhile,
her sisters was really weird.

4304
02:48:34,340 --> 02:48:38,360
Her sister didn't go to Catholic school.
Her sister went to school with me.

4305
02:48:38,361 --> 02:48:40,610
Should we do a regular school?
She was normal.

4306
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:42,830
She was fucking normal.
I mean,

4307
02:48:42,831 --> 02:48:44,840
she was a,
I mean,

4308
02:48:44,841 --> 02:48:46,970
just nice girl and everything.
Nothing wrong with her.

4309
02:48:47,600 --> 02:48:49,460
Fun hang out with,
but normal.

4310
02:48:49,461 --> 02:48:50,440
She wasn't a werewolf.
Yeah,

4311
02:48:50,460 --> 02:48:52,580
nothing insane.
Her sister was a werewolf.

4312
02:48:54,030 --> 02:48:57,230
The Werewolf for Dick too.
She was a monster and it was the only

4313
02:48:57,231 --> 02:48:59,750
one in the family that was like that.
And I just don't,

4314
02:48:59,900 --> 02:49:04,070
I don't see any other correlation shiny
this for years.

4315
02:49:04,430 --> 02:49:08,490
She's probably in a fucking orgy.
She's a fifth nine nine 80 getting stuck

4316
02:49:08,970 --> 02:49:10,530
by like five [inaudible].

4317
02:49:10,620 --> 02:49:11,790
Two of them.
She's German.

4318
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:15,720
She's face fucking him there.
That she's an animal.

4319
02:49:16,740 --> 02:49:17,920
Girls an animal.
Is He?

4320
02:49:17,930 --> 02:49:19,710
I said,
well that's I gotta be with are a women

4321
02:49:19,711 --> 02:49:21,540
that get into porn.
Probably had some kind of repression

4322
02:49:21,541 --> 02:49:22,130
like that.
Right?

4323
02:49:22,130 --> 02:49:23,760
That's the thing.
It's more molestation.

4324
02:49:24,130 --> 02:49:24,961
Yes,
the most.

4325
02:49:24,961 --> 02:49:26,940
It's the most,
but it's not all of them.

4326
02:49:26,970 --> 02:49:27,511
I,
you know,

4327
02:49:27,511 --> 02:49:30,810
there's a thing that they always want to
say that all women who get into porn or

4328
02:49:30,811 --> 02:49:31,920
fucked up,
man,

4329
02:49:31,921 --> 02:49:32,540
I,
I know,

4330
02:49:32,540 --> 02:49:33,470
I don't believe that.
No.

4331
02:49:34,130 --> 02:49:35,310
Yeah.
And there's a thing that people was

4332
02:49:35,311 --> 02:49:36,780
like,
someone was saying the other day that

4333
02:49:36,930 --> 02:49:39,960
porn addiction is real and porn is
fucked up.

4334
02:49:39,961 --> 02:49:43,950
Cause it ruins way guys think.
And like maybe some guys.

4335
02:49:43,951 --> 02:49:45,870
But isn't that the same as with
gambling?

4336
02:49:45,960 --> 02:49:48,780
Like isn't gambling really bad for some
guys?

4337
02:49:48,860 --> 02:49:50,520
Yeah.
You know it is right?

4338
02:49:50,521 --> 02:49:51,600
Yeah.
It ruins people's lives.

4339
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:52,970
Ruins their life.
Yes.

4340
02:49:53,030 --> 02:49:55,680
I think there's certain guys that just
can't fucking gamble.

4341
02:49:55,681 --> 02:49:57,570
Right.
Who was it that was saying that he,

4342
02:49:57,630 --> 02:50:02,630
his dad lost their house over gambling
early podcast.

4343
02:50:03,390 --> 02:50:05,690
God dammit,
that growing up.

4344
02:50:06,450 --> 02:50:08,160
Want to say it was one of Calvin's
friends,

4345
02:50:08,820 --> 02:50:11,430
was it Jimmy Burke?
It might've been,

4346
02:50:11,460 --> 02:50:12,750
I mean,
I come from my grandfather's a

4347
02:50:12,810 --> 02:50:14,790
microphone that works at the dog track
in Chicago.

4348
02:50:14,820 --> 02:50:17,220
I think it was Jimmy Burke chose whole
life.

4349
02:50:17,250 --> 02:50:19,920
Dad was a crazy gambler.
But yeah man,

4350
02:50:19,921 --> 02:50:21,750
there's a,
I knew a lot of guys like that from the

4351
02:50:21,751 --> 02:50:24,660
pool hall that had just every nickel
they earned,

4352
02:50:24,890 --> 02:50:27,210
they would below.
They always owed money and they were

4353
02:50:27,211 --> 02:50:30,150
hiding from people is always gambling
that lifestyle.

4354
02:50:30,151 --> 02:50:31,860
So wild.
But I don't have a problem with

4355
02:50:31,861 --> 02:50:33,990
gambling.
So if I go to Vegas and uh,

4356
02:50:34,020 --> 02:50:35,760
you know,
I don't bet on anything,

4357
02:50:35,761 --> 02:50:37,590
but if I,
I used to bet on fights,

4358
02:50:37,710 --> 02:50:39,690
so if I,
maybe if I'm in Vegas and just for a

4359
02:50:39,691 --> 02:50:42,090
fucking goof,
Canelo Alvarez is going to fight.

4360
02:50:42,090 --> 02:50:45,720
Gennady Golovkin I get to the sport to
book like a day before the fight and my

4361
02:50:45,730 --> 02:50:47,820
cow put a fucking couple hundred bucks
on this.

4362
02:50:48,570 --> 02:50:50,340
I think triple g's got it.
And A,

4363
02:50:50,390 --> 02:50:55,200
and I'll throw my hat in the ring,
but I'm not going to lose my mind and

4364
02:50:55,201 --> 02:50:58,410
bet my life was with some people.
It's their whole existence to have to,

4365
02:50:58,470 --> 02:51:00,360
it doesn't mean that I shouldn't be able
to go gamble.

4366
02:51:00,480 --> 02:51:03,480
It's just like the same thing is if I'm
in a hotel room and I want to jerk off,

4367
02:51:03,720 --> 02:51:06,510
I don't want to hear your bullshit about
somebody who's addicted to and it ruins

4368
02:51:06,511 --> 02:51:07,440
their life.
That's,

4369
02:51:07,680 --> 02:51:10,440
I'm sad.
I'm sad that someone got addicted to it

4370
02:51:10,441 --> 02:51:13,110
and [inaudible] them,
but as nothing that I can do about that

4371
02:51:13,111 --> 02:51:14,820
in porn is a real thing.
So what do you,

4372
02:51:14,821 --> 02:51:15,630
what do you want me to do?

4373
02:51:15,630 --> 02:51:19,970
It was the same with alcohol is to
abandoned all my jerking off and not

4374
02:51:19,980 --> 02:51:22,680
watch the stuff that I want to watch
because somewhere there's someone who

4375
02:51:22,681 --> 02:51:25,740
can't handle it.
Or do we have to like educate people?

4376
02:51:25,770 --> 02:51:29,250
Hey,
some people they have weak chins and

4377
02:51:29,251 --> 02:51:30,210
they just,
they don't think,

4378
02:51:30,211 --> 02:51:32,370
well,
you shouldn't get into boxing.

4379
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:33,100
Right.
Okay.

4380
02:51:33,100 --> 02:51:34,170
It says,
you know what I mean?

4381
02:51:34,380 --> 02:51:36,300
Like if you can't take a punch,
don't get into boxing.

4382
02:51:36,540 --> 02:51:39,840
If you just,
if you watch one porn film and next

4383
02:51:39,841 --> 02:51:43,320
thing you know,
five hours later you're dehydrated.

4384
02:51:43,440 --> 02:51:46,080
You know you haven't left the room,
your legs don't work.

4385
02:51:46,800 --> 02:51:50,400
Your fucking hands tired.
You got tennis elbow like it's not my

4386
02:51:50,401 --> 02:51:51,540
fault.
Okay.

4387
02:51:51,541 --> 02:51:54,210
I don't know what to tell you should I
not jerk off now?

4388
02:51:54,870 --> 02:51:57,930
But those people that suffer through,
it's like people were alcoholics like,

4389
02:51:58,020 --> 02:51:58,860
oh,
what are you drinking?

4390
02:51:58,890 --> 02:51:59,760
You're drinking?
Yeah.

4391
02:52:00,030 --> 02:52:01,350
Yeah.
I like to have a drink.

4392
02:52:01,800 --> 02:52:04,230
You know why?
Cause I'll go weeks without having one

4393
02:52:04,231 --> 02:52:06,670
for it ruined my family doesn't fuck my
life up.

4394
02:52:06,910 --> 02:52:09,700
I like to have a drink.
I don't go home and kick my fucking dog

4395
02:52:09,701 --> 02:52:12,460
around the house and beat my kids.
I like to have a drink.

4396
02:52:12,610 --> 02:52:14,680
Is that all right?
To have a glass of wine with dinner?

4397
02:52:14,770 --> 02:52:17,890
Does that mean that I have to respect
the guy who lost everything and he's

4398
02:52:17,891 --> 02:52:20,440
fucking homeless and he's sucking dicks
for cheap wine?

4399
02:52:20,470 --> 02:52:22,330
Nope,
because he couldn't handle it.

4400
02:52:22,331 --> 02:52:25,840
So I should add of respect for him.
Pushed that peanut on the wireless side.

4401
02:52:25,960 --> 02:52:26,351
No,
no,

4402
02:52:26,351 --> 02:52:28,570
no.
It's not a palate cleanser.

4403
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:32,590
When you're having a nice steak and some
a fine garlic mashed potatoes,

4404
02:52:32,680 --> 02:52:34,870
that's a terrible drug that ruins
families.

4405
02:52:34,900 --> 02:52:36,880
Right?
Just like the porn.

4406
02:52:37,030 --> 02:52:39,700
Just like fucking everything though.
It's like working out.

4407
02:52:39,701 --> 02:52:41,830
You can be addicted to working out so
many people are.

4408
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:43,470
They are.
There's a lot of people that are off.

4409
02:52:43,710 --> 02:52:45,290
Stop you from lifting.
Come on,

4410
02:52:46,010 --> 02:52:50,040
come on.
People are too fucking Goddamn soft.

4411
02:52:50,070 --> 02:52:55,070
That's the problem.
We're so saw other people so much that

4412
02:52:55,651 --> 02:52:56,940
we're ruining them and we're ruining
them.

4413
02:52:57,450 --> 02:53:00,240
We were ruining people.
God dammit.

4414
02:53:00,820 --> 02:53:03,360
Santina know.
How did we get to this?

4415
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:06,660
Maybe it doesn't know.
He's looking at porn like he mad.

4416
02:53:06,690 --> 02:53:08,340
He does.
He looks at porn all the time.

4417
02:53:08,490 --> 02:53:12,900
I see it in his eyes like you see the
glint glimmer,

4418
02:53:13,040 --> 02:53:15,300
what was going on?
Let me see what's going on.

4419
02:53:19,220 --> 02:53:21,690
Yeah.
Watching porn is one of the weirdest

4420
02:53:21,691 --> 02:53:24,600
taboos because you think about how many
people watch it.

4421
02:53:25,030 --> 02:53:28,150
I mean it is.
I the last that didn't we talk about

4422
02:53:28,151 --> 02:53:30,010
this once,
but it was something insane.

4423
02:53:30,011 --> 02:53:31,440
Like 20% of all Internet

4424
02:53:31,470 --> 02:53:34,470
traffic is all one word.
I thought it was more than that.

4425
02:53:34,560 --> 02:53:39,560
More when you asserting 39% I'm gonna
say 39 I'm going to say,

4426
02:53:40,590 --> 02:53:44,040
I'd say I'm going to do 42 isn't most of
it Netflix now?

4427
02:53:45,120 --> 02:53:50,120
30% 30% what percent is Netflix?
70 I want to say 49 I don't know why I'm

4428
02:53:52,411 --> 02:53:55,470
in the ninth today.
I'm going to say 36 Ooh,

4429
02:53:57,450 --> 02:53:58,770
this is like a,
the price is right.

4430
02:53:58,800 --> 02:54:03,120
You got 37 yelled it.
Damn some knuckles stupid.

4431
02:54:03,150 --> 02:54:05,640
Went to five and just North America,
but 36 of all.

4432
02:54:05,820 --> 02:54:07,890
Wow.
Do you got super specific?

4433
02:54:07,920 --> 02:54:08,281
Wait,
wait,

4434
02:54:08,281 --> 02:54:11,520
32.25 in just North America.
36 overall.

4435
02:54:11,521 --> 02:54:13,860
So,
but that was October 8th of 2015 so it's

4436
02:54:13,861 --> 02:54:16,170
got to be more now probably been,
how crazy is that?

4437
02:54:16,171 --> 02:54:19,380
That the United States has that big of a
market and the rest of the world is just

4438
02:54:19,381 --> 02:54:22,110
four or five points.
I'll tell you why that's wrong because

4439
02:54:22,111 --> 02:54:24,270
uh,
Ian Edwards was just somewhere that was

4440
02:54:24,271 --> 02:54:28,500
saying how the international market now
has almost matched and Ian's working on

4441
02:54:28,501 --> 02:54:31,320
a Netflix show and their international
markets almost mashed in North America.

4442
02:54:31,320 --> 02:54:32,430
Now.
That was what,

4443
02:54:32,431 --> 02:54:34,830
three years ago?
It's got to be way higher now.

4444
02:54:35,070 --> 02:54:36,180
That's crazy.
Way Higher.

4445
02:54:36,330 --> 02:54:37,740
That is crazy.
You know they made in the,

4446
02:54:37,860 --> 02:54:39,750
in the fourth quarter last year,
Netflix,

4447
02:54:40,090 --> 02:54:41,850
take a guests,
don't look it up and take a guess.

4448
02:54:42,270 --> 02:54:45,360
80 kazillion dollars.
No,

4449
02:54:45,361 --> 02:54:45,661
no,
no.

4450
02:54:45,661 --> 02:54:49,170
And just the fourth quarter last year
they made 3.4 billion and just the

4451
02:54:49,171 --> 02:54:51,150
fourth court.
10 for the year.

4452
02:54:51,151 --> 02:54:52,230
That's probably right.
Wow.

4453
02:54:52,950 --> 02:54:55,590
Well death thrown it around at comics.
I'll tell you that.

4454
02:54:55,650 --> 02:54:58,410
I wish they were thrown into me.
They will be santeen and first of all,

4455
02:54:58,420 --> 02:55:00,690
you would have been a little too white
and the future is dark.

4456
02:55:00,970 --> 02:55:03,210
I know the future's Brown and Meek.

4457
02:55:04,730 --> 02:55:07,820
If you had glasses and you were thin and
Brown,

4458
02:55:08,320 --> 02:55:09,980
you'd have a show.
I'd have two shows.

4459
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:12,700
If you were a woman and you had glasses.
Yeah.

4460
02:55:13,010 --> 02:55:14,460
And you were Brown.
I might,

4461
02:55:14,990 --> 02:55:16,460
I might transform.
No,

4462
02:55:16,520 --> 02:55:20,030
I think that what it is right now is
that they just have so many specialists

4463
02:55:20,031 --> 02:55:22,040
that they're working on.
That's my biggest problem was trying to

4464
02:55:22,041 --> 02:55:23,300
say that they be like,
oh,

4465
02:55:23,301 --> 02:55:25,100
you know,
they're only going after,

4466
02:55:25,101 --> 02:55:29,120
I forget what term he used,
like either hipsters or they're going

4467
02:55:29,121 --> 02:55:30,350
after a,
you know,

4468
02:55:30,351 --> 02:55:32,960
diversity and like they're not,
they're not going to give it to a white

4469
02:55:32,961 --> 02:55:33,794
guy.
I'm like,

4470
02:55:33,860 --> 02:55:35,670
John Malaney just got a special,
yeah,

4471
02:55:35,860 --> 02:55:39,140
we talking about like this,
Craig Ferguson just got it special.

4472
02:55:39,140 --> 02:55:41,240
It's just those that have built it.
You have to build yourself.

4473
02:55:41,241 --> 02:55:42,320
You have to be built.
Well,

4474
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:44,270
that's how it always was.
Yeah,

4475
02:55:44,271 --> 02:55:45,104
of course

4476
02:55:45,490 --> 02:55:48,730
the way it always used to be,
and this is the problem is there's no

4477
02:55:48,731 --> 02:55:53,731
real valid entry level show.
So what it used to be is you would get

4478
02:55:54,641 --> 02:55:59,641
on like young comedian special on hbo
and then there would be like four of Ya.

4479
02:56:00,550 --> 02:56:04,150
Everybody would do 15 minutes or so and
then that's how you'd make it.

4480
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:05,470
Right.
And then there was the Rodney

4481
02:56:05,471 --> 02:56:09,100
dangerfield specials and that's how we
found out about Lenny Clarke and dom

4482
02:56:09,101 --> 02:56:09,940
Irrera,
right.

4483
02:56:10,300 --> 02:56:11,950
Bill Hicks,
Sam Kinison,

4484
02:56:11,951 --> 02:56:13,570
dice clay,
they all came out of the Rodney

4485
02:56:13,571 --> 02:56:16,690
dangerfield specials.
There's not a thing like that anymore.

4486
02:56:16,691 --> 02:56:18,880
So you got to go through those things
before he got a special,

4487
02:56:18,970 --> 02:56:21,820
it's wild.
Now it's like you just kinda get

4488
02:56:21,821 --> 02:56:22,654
specials,

4489
02:56:23,170 --> 02:56:26,020
right.
You have to find a way into the game.

4490
02:56:26,380 --> 02:56:28,510
You have to find,
you have to find like the niche that

4491
02:56:28,511 --> 02:56:30,670
gets you to the place to get the
special.

4492
02:56:30,730 --> 02:56:34,000
Will you have a showtime special?
I do hepatis special up on showtime last

4493
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,530
year,
but the problem is showtimes market is

4494
02:56:35,531 --> 02:56:37,060
so,
you know,

4495
02:56:37,430 --> 02:56:39,370
so specific.
It's only people that subscribed.

4496
02:56:39,400 --> 02:56:42,210
Meanwhile,
Netflix is fucking everybody.

4497
02:56:42,250 --> 02:56:45,700
That's true.
But meanwhile Sebastian became of the

4498
02:56:45,701 --> 02:56:48,400
biggest comics in the world because it's
just cause a showtime.

4499
02:56:48,401 --> 02:56:48,830
Yeah,
no,

4500
02:56:48,830 --> 02:56:52,050
Sebastian is the Unicorn man.
Like when people go,

4501
02:56:52,051 --> 02:56:53,290
well,
how did he make it so big?

4502
02:56:53,291 --> 02:56:55,060
Well first of all,
he's really funny,

4503
02:56:55,090 --> 02:56:56,650
very funny,
great guy,

4504
02:56:56,800 --> 02:57:00,660
family friendly and for whatever reason
he,

4505
02:57:00,670 --> 02:57:03,610
whatever show times fucking target
market is clear.

4506
02:57:03,611 --> 02:57:06,220
He just flew right through it.
He was like,

4507
02:57:06,221 --> 02:57:09,030
there's an opening and he just like,
oh shit,

4508
02:57:09,031 --> 02:57:09,910
I'll touching the wall.

4509
02:57:10,150 --> 02:57:11,770
He just went right through.
Right.

4510
02:57:11,771 --> 02:57:12,850
It's perfect.
Perfect.

4511
02:57:12,870 --> 02:57:14,320
Yeah,
but that's what all that is.

4512
02:57:14,321 --> 02:57:16,000
That's all perfect timing and I,
you know,

4513
02:57:16,090 --> 02:57:17,140
yeah,
I mean showtimes bigger.

4514
02:57:17,141 --> 02:57:19,600
I don't know if I would do another one
anytime soon at all,

4515
02:57:19,601 --> 02:57:21,190
but if they did,
if I did do another one,

4516
02:57:21,191 --> 02:57:22,150
I do it with them.
You know,

4517
02:57:22,300 --> 02:57:23,460
I don't really care where it is.
I,

4518
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:27,190
I just care the content that I put on it
and someone see it online,

4519
02:57:27,191 --> 02:57:29,470
can they go and get that show time?
That's the biggest,

4520
02:57:29,471 --> 02:57:30,191
that's the problem.
See,

4521
02:57:30,191 --> 02:57:32,470
that's the thing about Netflix that's so
great is everybody has it,

4522
02:57:32,980 --> 02:57:35,170
but showtime is like my specialist
always there.

4523
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:37,140
It's just you have to have showtime.
We've

4524
02:57:37,150 --> 02:57:41,260
talked about doing this with podcasts
about doing the same kind of thing,

4525
02:57:41,290 --> 02:57:46,290
like coming up with a bunch of cash and
have an all podcasts under one umbrella.

4526
02:57:46,960 --> 02:57:48,610
Right.
You know,

4527
02:57:48,740 --> 02:57:53,650
w like a Netflix type deal because
everybody has their own way of doing it

4528
02:57:53,651 --> 02:57:55,360
now.
Like everybody has their own way of

4529
02:57:55,361 --> 02:57:58,240
doing it in terms of like,
some people have ads,

4530
02:57:58,480 --> 02:58:02,240
some people have like a go fund me or
Patrion page.

4531
02:58:02,670 --> 02:58:03,840
But that would fuck,
yeah.

4532
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:04,900
Would fuck you up,
right?

4533
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:06,600
Probably.
Yeah.

4534
02:58:06,660 --> 02:58:07,710
I mean that would,
that seems like,

4535
02:58:08,790 --> 02:58:10,920
unless it was like a netflix thing where
everybody had it.

4536
02:58:11,190 --> 02:58:12,480
It's,
that would have to be the thing.

4537
02:58:12,510 --> 02:58:15,120
Yeah.
But what do you like Netflix is movies

4538
02:58:15,121 --> 02:58:17,370
and movies.
Take a shit load of money to make

4539
02:58:17,400 --> 02:58:19,740
Netflix is TV shows.
They take a shitload of money to make

4540
02:58:20,910 --> 02:58:24,240
this podcast.
You could have done it on a phone.

4541
02:58:24,241 --> 02:58:27,450
We could have set our iphone on the
table right there.

4542
02:58:27,480 --> 02:58:30,360
Press the auto record thing and just
gone.

4543
02:58:30,490 --> 02:58:33,060
Yeah.
But instead we've got Jamie doing all

4544
02:58:33,061 --> 02:58:36,910
these fake button pushing and pr bro and
fun flat cap.

4545
02:58:36,911 --> 02:58:40,140
Apple's market cap.
That's why me and Marcus Brown market

4546
02:58:40,141 --> 02:58:43,890
cap is closing in on $1 trillion.
He had got $1 trillion.

4547
02:58:43,891 --> 02:58:45,900
You could literally buy every single
NFL,

4548
02:58:45,901 --> 02:58:50,901
NBA and mls team for NASA and a hundred
thousand teslas and still have money

4549
02:58:51,331 --> 02:58:53,520
leftover.
But you couldn't buy apple.

4550
02:58:53,880 --> 02:58:54,713
Whoa.

4551
02:58:56,600 --> 02:59:00,810
Uh,
by Netflix seven and a half times.

4552
02:59:01,350 --> 02:59:06,030
Wow.
But apple is that what they're doing

4553
02:59:06,031 --> 02:59:07,860
with podcasts is very interesting
because they just,

4554
02:59:08,280 --> 02:59:09,870
they're just an aggregator.
You know,

4555
02:59:10,120 --> 02:59:13,020
like you have to have your own host and
you just put it up on there and,

4556
02:59:13,350 --> 02:59:17,130
but through their itunes,
I mean we're always in this trending

4557
02:59:17,131 --> 02:59:19,860
section and we're always in like,
um,

4558
02:59:19,950 --> 02:59:23,340
like the rankings when you're looking at
like who the top podcasts are,

4559
02:59:23,341 --> 02:59:26,130
we're always in there and that helps
people find you totally.

4560
02:59:26,160 --> 02:59:29,310
So they're helping people find you.
They are kind of a network in a way,

4561
02:59:29,490 --> 02:59:32,700
but they're not a network in a way.
Like they're not like a youtube where

4562
02:59:32,701 --> 02:59:36,120
they control content and not like
they're not,

4563
02:59:37,260 --> 02:59:39,420
they're not really,
they're not hosting you.

4564
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:41,940
Well they have apple music too,
but podcasts are part of that.

4565
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:44,100
I wonder if they,
to do that so weird that they don't

4566
02:59:44,101 --> 02:59:47,550
merge those like that that podcast is a
separate tab,

4567
02:59:47,580 --> 02:59:48,990
which makes no fucking sense to me.

4568
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:51,450
Like it's just to be a sub category of
music.

4569
02:59:51,540 --> 02:59:52,440
It should be.
Right.

4570
02:59:52,441 --> 02:59:56,250
But then there's a thing of if you have
something on itunes,

4571
02:59:56,580 --> 02:59:58,650
right,
and like apple music,

4572
02:59:58,651 --> 03:00:01,170
is it totally different jam,
right.

4573
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:03,850
Like apple music is them hosting it,
isn't it?

4574
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:07,380
They would have.
It would have your podcast.

4575
03:00:07,381 --> 03:00:09,270
So if you said something really fucked
up,

4576
03:00:09,780 --> 03:00:12,390
like maybe they would get in trouble for
having you on.

4577
03:00:12,450 --> 03:00:14,730
I don't think so.
Think they won't sponsor someone song.

4578
03:00:14,780 --> 03:00:15,171
No.
Yeah,

4579
03:00:15,171 --> 03:00:16,170
same way.
Same thing.

4580
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:21,740
Like any like radical punk rock fucking
crazy to my fucking mother host it.

4581
03:00:23,070 --> 03:00:24,360
Right.
Going into it.

4582
03:00:24,361 --> 03:00:26,190
But I mean I don't think but like look
up like,

4583
03:00:26,570 --> 03:00:31,380
but apple music can't like what does a
spotify market versus the apple music

4584
03:00:31,381 --> 03:00:31,771
market?
Like?

4585
03:00:31,771 --> 03:00:33,330
I don't think apple music has does well
at all.

4586
03:00:33,331 --> 03:00:37,590
I think she's doing way better now,
but not as well as spotify does.

4587
03:00:38,340 --> 03:00:40,340
Cause I feel like spotify just dominates
the mark.

4588
03:00:40,341 --> 03:00:40,891
Yeah.
But see,

4589
03:00:40,891 --> 03:00:43,890
apple music's on everyone's phone now
and you just find it and use it.

4590
03:00:44,070 --> 03:00:47,370
It's so easy to use.
You don't use spotify.

4591
03:00:47,700 --> 03:00:48,720
See,
but I think it's the,

4592
03:00:48,740 --> 03:00:52,290
the youngest generation loves spotify.
Like they love soundcloud.

4593
03:00:52,600 --> 03:00:53,433
Soundcloud.
Yeah.

4594
03:00:54,060 --> 03:00:56,390
So big.
They loved they soundcloud.

4595
03:00:56,460 --> 03:00:58,320
A lot of people were using the host
podcasts.

4596
03:00:58,321 --> 03:00:58,960
Yeah,
totally.

4597
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:00,550
But a lot of people think that it won't
be around.

4598
03:01:00,670 --> 03:01:01,930
Oh,
I think that's the opposite.

4599
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:02,950
Yeah.
Not only do I think,

4600
03:01:02,951 --> 03:01:05,980
not only is it for stuff like that,
that's homemade podcast stuff like diy,

4601
03:01:06,010 --> 03:01:09,350
it's also set to surpass spotify page
paid subscribers.

4602
03:01:09,380 --> 03:01:09,990
Right,
right.

4603
03:01:09,990 --> 03:01:11,680
Cause spotify starts off for free.
Right,

4604
03:01:11,780 --> 03:01:12,940
right.
Interesting.

4605
03:01:13,660 --> 03:01:15,790
Um,
but like that's my thing is like,

4606
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:17,530
uh,
you know,

4607
03:01:17,531 --> 03:01:20,500
like that the future of soundcloud thing
like that is because it's,

4608
03:01:20,530 --> 03:01:22,450
it's all,
everybody loves diy shit.

4609
03:01:22,450 --> 03:01:25,660
Whether it's musicians or like all those
musicians and artists now that are on

4610
03:01:25,661 --> 03:01:27,790
spotify,
it's all people like making music in

4611
03:01:27,791 --> 03:01:29,350
their fucking,
in their house.

4612
03:01:29,830 --> 03:01:30,830
Fucking youtube,
you know?

4613
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:32,500
I mean,
how many youtube millionaires have been

4614
03:01:32,501 --> 03:01:36,340
made from a lot,
so many weird shit.

4615
03:01:36,880 --> 03:01:38,440
Putting up videos,
talking.

4616
03:01:38,470 --> 03:01:40,210
I know some from the,
I know some from the beginning,

4617
03:01:40,211 --> 03:01:44,440
like I used to do a youtube sketch thing
a long time ago and like caught fire a

4618
03:01:44,441 --> 03:01:47,860
little bit on a fairly small scale and
the people that we kind of associated

4619
03:01:47,861 --> 03:01:51,280
with when it was starting to grow,
two or three of them now that I know

4620
03:01:51,760 --> 03:01:54,550
have made so much money from that and
they were just from the jump,

4621
03:01:54,551 --> 03:01:56,800
they were kind of like in right as the
cusp was like beginning.

4622
03:01:56,801 --> 03:02:00,430
You know what happens with that dude who
got in trouble with the suicide?

4623
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:02,050
Is that Jager?
Logan Paul.

4624
03:02:02,051 --> 03:02:03,490
Which one is he?
Logan.

4625
03:02:03,491 --> 03:02:04,324
Paul Logan.
Paul.

4626
03:02:04,630 --> 03:02:05,680
He's,
he's banned.

4627
03:02:05,710 --> 03:02:08,350
They don't,
they demonetize his entire channel and I

4628
03:02:08,351 --> 03:02:09,610
thought he's still making videos.
Right?

4629
03:02:10,080 --> 03:02:13,810
He's not making any money.
They took all his ad money away because

4630
03:02:13,811 --> 03:02:16,770
he electrocuted a dead rat.
No.

4631
03:02:16,980 --> 03:02:18,790
Yes.
He did a video yesterday at two and a

4632
03:02:18,791 --> 03:02:19,571
half.
A million views.

4633
03:02:19,571 --> 03:02:20,740
So,
but he doesn't get paid?

4634
03:02:21,650 --> 03:02:22,740
No,
there were saying that it's,

4635
03:02:22,741 --> 03:02:26,110
his entire channel was demonetized
unless he got lawyers involved.

4636
03:02:26,290 --> 03:02:29,620
So then he could be just using his
channel and then getting sponsored

4637
03:02:29,621 --> 03:02:32,810
videos
and merge,

4638
03:02:32,890 --> 03:02:34,900
which is one of the big things to me,
it's stunning.

4639
03:02:34,901 --> 03:02:37,720
Makes more unmerge probably then it
doesn't from fucking youtube probably

4640
03:02:37,721 --> 03:02:40,990
does it.
To me it's stunning that there is not a

4641
03:02:40,991 --> 03:02:43,480
competitor to Youtube,
not a real competitor.

4642
03:02:43,510 --> 03:02:44,800
Yeah,
there's been tried.

4643
03:02:44,920 --> 03:02:46,300
They've tried.
It's crazy.

4644
03:02:46,301 --> 03:02:48,520
Vimeo is just not,
not happening.

4645
03:02:48,720 --> 03:02:50,590
Well it's a video hosting site,
but it's not,

4646
03:02:51,160 --> 03:02:53,200
it's not as user friendly.
Well it's also,

4647
03:02:53,201 --> 03:02:56,240
it doesn't suggest things.
Their algorithm that youtube was totaled

4648
03:02:56,260 --> 03:02:58,870
out to having what's next on the right
hand side,

4649
03:02:58,900 --> 03:03:02,650
it's like so attractive because there's
always something there to click on Vimeo

4650
03:03:02,651 --> 03:03:04,930
does.is that they're not as
sophisticated in that way.

4651
03:03:04,931 --> 03:03:06,510
They want to be the artistic,
uh,

4652
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:08,210
you know,
culture.

4653
03:03:08,230 --> 03:03:10,390
They want to cultivate like the sexy
little artistic thing.

4654
03:03:10,391 --> 03:03:11,141
Youtube is like,
fuck it.

4655
03:03:11,141 --> 03:03:12,730
Here's everything we've,
you've ever wanted to see.

4656
03:03:13,480 --> 03:03:15,970
And ads for Tampons,
we had,

4657
03:03:15,971 --> 03:03:18,730
um,
W W we're putting up every video on

4658
03:03:18,731 --> 03:03:22,090
Vimeo as well as on Youtube,
but on youtube it'll have over a million

4659
03:03:22,091 --> 03:03:23,980
videos,
a million hits.

4660
03:03:24,070 --> 03:03:26,680
And then you go to Vimeo and the same
video we'll have like what,

4661
03:03:26,740 --> 03:03:27,670
20,
30,000,

4662
03:03:28,090 --> 03:03:28,923
20,000.
Yeah,

4663
03:03:29,230 --> 03:03:29,950
that's,
I was gonna say,

4664
03:03:29,950 --> 03:03:31,020
cause there,
there was so sick,

4665
03:03:31,030 --> 03:03:33,520
their viewer traffic is so much lower.
It's so much lower.

4666
03:03:33,521 --> 03:03:36,700
The only time I watch vimeo is when
someone sends me an email link.

4667
03:03:37,100 --> 03:03:41,710
And you got to think that video link is
being sent to whatever million people I

4668
03:03:41,711 --> 03:03:43,120
have on twitter.
Totally.

4669
03:03:43,240 --> 03:03:46,090
I have like 2 million people in 2
million Russian bots.

4670
03:03:48,100 --> 03:03:50,200
I'm not sure which one.
They're all bought suits.

4671
03:03:50,310 --> 03:03:51,850
I don't,
I don't know how that works.

4672
03:03:51,851 --> 03:03:53,950
I think in a bought,
some of them they say it's if you

4673
03:03:53,951 --> 03:03:56,890
haven't used it to post,
but there's a lot of people that use

4674
03:03:56,900 --> 03:03:59,990
twitter and they don't post.
So like how do you know if someone's a

4675
03:03:59,991 --> 03:04:02,760
Bot,
like there's some suspicion of their,

4676
03:04:02,790 --> 03:04:05,040
um,
their detection methods to decide who's,

4677
03:04:05,050 --> 03:04:07,490
he always can tell when you look at
their fucking profile,

4678
03:04:07,690 --> 03:04:09,410
the stuff they write is so funny.
Oh,

4679
03:04:09,411 --> 03:04:10,800
there's definitely some of those,
you know,

4680
03:04:10,850 --> 03:04:14,930
I get a lot of those on instagram.
Get a lot of those really.

4681
03:04:14,931 --> 03:04:17,270
Yay.
A weird like fake comments.

4682
03:04:17,300 --> 03:04:18,260
You know,
like a,

4683
03:04:18,261 --> 03:04:21,530
I learned how to make $109 a week all
over the place.

4684
03:04:21,920 --> 03:04:23,750
Those things are everywhere,
you know,

4685
03:04:23,840 --> 03:04:25,310
it's uh,
it's like,

4686
03:04:25,370 --> 03:04:27,050
who are they getting with that?
Like,

4687
03:04:27,051 --> 03:04:27,884
who are they?

4688
03:04:28,040 --> 03:04:30,080
Who are they going after?
Literally nobody.

4689
03:04:30,140 --> 03:04:30,850
Yeah.
Nobody,

4690
03:04:30,850 --> 03:04:33,200
they can't make any money.
That's gotta be just like a whole soul

4691
03:04:33,201 --> 03:04:34,890
people.
They'll get some man.

4692
03:04:34,900 --> 03:04:36,020
Really,
man,

4693
03:04:36,021 --> 03:04:38,840
I watched the saddest show once with
this old dude kept getting,

4694
03:04:39,170 --> 03:04:43,640
he kept getting scammed by this Nigerian
scammer who's pretended he was a hot

4695
03:04:43,641 --> 03:04:46,610
girl that wanted to meet him in Europe.
This poor fuck flew to Europe twice to

4696
03:04:46,611 --> 03:04:49,070
meet this girl.
And both times she came up with excuses

4697
03:04:49,071 --> 03:04:50,780
why she couldn't meet him,
but for some,

4698
03:04:50,781 --> 03:04:51,201
but,
but you know,

4699
03:04:51,201 --> 03:04:52,700
like dude,
Darwinism dude.

4700
03:04:52,970 --> 03:04:53,840
Well,
yeah,

4701
03:04:53,870 --> 03:04:56,390
I think has shown an idiot.
Can you feel bad for that guy?

4702
03:04:56,391 --> 03:05:00,380
He was this older guy and his,
his daughter and uh,

4703
03:05:00,440 --> 03:05:03,020
everybody died and no,
they were alive,

4704
03:05:03,021 --> 03:05:04,910
but they were sad.
They were watching this poor guy get

4705
03:05:04,911 --> 03:05:06,980
fucking scammed and keep traveling to
Europe,

4706
03:05:06,981 --> 03:05:10,220
and he didn't want to believe the girl
didn't exist and you were watching it

4707
03:05:10,221 --> 03:05:13,780
and like everyone knew,
but him like you knew I watched him

4708
03:05:13,800 --> 03:05:14,720
like,
no,

4709
03:05:14,750 --> 03:05:15,680
that's why I can't feel bad.

4710
03:05:15,680 --> 03:05:19,100
Did that God let him live that fantasy.
Then life is just a fantasy.

4711
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,500
It's fantasy.
Let him live that sad fantasy.

4712
03:05:22,570 --> 03:05:24,430
Al De Nova.
Tada.

4713
03:05:26,330 --> 03:05:29,150
I watched the video that the other day.
We're at the store,

4714
03:05:29,260 --> 03:05:31,490
uh,
we were in the secret comic bar.

4715
03:05:31,800 --> 03:05:33,380
We started talking about Aldo Nova.
I'm like,

4716
03:05:33,381 --> 03:05:35,540
do you remember that song?
And I put it up on Youtube.

4717
03:05:35,541 --> 03:05:37,820
We're sitting there like laughing,
watching some video.

4718
03:05:37,980 --> 03:05:39,410
Yeah.
I miss the old videos,

4719
03:05:39,411 --> 03:05:40,800
man.
The beginning of it.

4720
03:05:41,040 --> 03:05:44,510
Nova uses guitar to break into a
building and then he performs on stage.

4721
03:05:44,990 --> 03:05:47,060
This is the beginning of it.
You could play at the beginning of it

4722
03:05:47,061 --> 03:05:49,310
because it's not music.
No,

4723
03:05:49,760 --> 03:05:50,301
no.
We can't.

4724
03:05:50,301 --> 03:05:54,440
We'll get booted off youtube,
but it's a fucking ridiculous music

4725
03:05:54,441 --> 03:05:56,210
videos.
A bunch of dudes and machine guns.

4726
03:05:56,630 --> 03:06:01,040
They opened up this helicopter lands and
fucking Aldo Nova steps out.

4727
03:06:02,840 --> 03:06:06,080
He's got a leopard outfit,
is sleeves are rolled up.

4728
03:06:06,080 --> 03:06:09,800
He's got knee high boots on and he
doesn't make eye contact with anybody.

4729
03:06:10,390 --> 03:06:13,340
Walks to the fucking state.
You can see your eyes back to the door.

4730
03:06:13,341 --> 03:06:16,520
It looks he's got a purpose in his walk.
They get to the door,

4731
03:06:16,550 --> 03:06:19,010
but he can't get in because the door is
locked.

4732
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:22,250
Shit to trying to get in.
Fuck can't get in.

4733
03:06:22,340 --> 03:06:25,160
Step back.
I'll though says he tries to break it

4734
03:06:25,161 --> 03:06:27,290
with his gun,
but he's weak ass bitch,

4735
03:06:27,920 --> 03:06:29,970
bitch.
That's where it seems almost like qb.

4736
03:06:29,980 --> 03:06:32,570
The guitar music is the key.
Puts the strap on.

4737
03:06:32,750 --> 03:06:33,920
Check this out,
man.

4738
03:06:34,190 --> 03:06:36,830
Down.
How Dow

4739
03:06:40,250 --> 03:06:42,590
melts off the fucking lock with his
guitar.

4740
03:06:42,591 --> 03:06:47,591
Bitch kicks open the door.
The fucking smoke machine starts going.

4741
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:51,080
They all walk in and the bands already
ready.

4742
03:06:52,220 --> 03:06:55,350
Come on baby.
Yeah,

4743
03:06:55,430 --> 03:06:57,270
that was it.
This is a timestamp.

4744
03:06:57,330 --> 03:07:00,930
This is what happens when you take lsd
and marijuana out of the market.

4745
03:07:01,260 --> 03:07:05,070
As soon as you make it illegal really
bad and make these fucking people

4746
03:07:05,071 --> 03:07:08,370
terrified for their lives.
No one does drugs and everybody just

4747
03:07:08,371 --> 03:07:11,500
falls into this kind of shitty music.
It's that what they're doing,

4748
03:07:11,501 --> 03:07:13,110
man.
I don't know what they're doing.

4749
03:07:13,140 --> 03:07:15,960
They literally like children.
They like been separated from the

4750
03:07:15,961 --> 03:07:18,090
umbilical cord.
They don't know how to get nutrition.

4751
03:07:18,420 --> 03:07:20,220
They're flying around freaking the fuck
out.

4752
03:07:20,250 --> 03:07:21,690
What is this?
Where am I?

4753
03:07:22,070 --> 03:07:24,880
It's just a fantasy.
Can you let us time to sit?

4754
03:07:24,900 --> 03:07:28,880
Lie.
This is such a terrible song.

4755
03:07:30,770 --> 03:07:32,210
When I was in high school,
it was the shit,

4756
03:07:32,211 --> 03:07:33,590
man.
Everybody's backside.

4757
03:07:33,591 --> 03:07:35,480
That's a terrible fucking song.
Now you do.

4758
03:07:35,500 --> 03:07:36,650
Yeah,
but back then,

4759
03:07:36,710 --> 03:07:38,330
you know,
it's like def leppard.

4760
03:07:38,331 --> 03:07:40,880
Sing and pour some sugar on me.
Fantasy.

4761
03:07:41,370 --> 03:07:42,980
All right,
I gotta wrap this up.

4762
03:07:43,190 --> 03:07:45,290

4763

4765
03:07:48,920 --> 03:07:49,950

4772
03:08:06,070 --> 03:08:06,140
Okay.
