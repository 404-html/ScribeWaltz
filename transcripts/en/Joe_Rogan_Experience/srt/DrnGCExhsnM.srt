1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:04,290
Four,
three,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,750
two,
yes.

3
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:07,500
Rob.
Hello.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,880
What's up buddy?
You look great man.

5
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:11,400
You look super healthy.
O' lakes when you're doing your mill.

6
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:16,401
I know you're doing a lot of Jujitsu but
you look leaner and I her and they took 

7
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,330
the pineal gland out of a small child 
and then implanted in me.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,530
Is that all you need to do?
Pretty much judging.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,560
If that was the case,
you'd people would run around with 

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,150
helmets on their kids illegal here.
Yeah.

11
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:27,780
So,
uh,

12
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:29,250
yeah.
Where'd you go to get it done?

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,740
I can't really divulge that.
Oh cool.

14
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,120
Cool.
Yeah,

15
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:33,030
we'll.
Wherever it was.

16
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:34,600
As long as he wasn't America.
Right?

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,140
Right.
So,

18
00:00:37,141 --> 00:00:37,920
uh,
you're,

19
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,930
you're,
you're balls deep in Jujitsu these days,

20
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:40,740
man.
Trying to.

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,970
Trying to.
Yeah,

22
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,100
but you could see that in you.
Like you look different.

23
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,130
You really do.
You look like when I was on here last 

24
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,950
time I was at the end of a pretty big 
travel cycle,

25
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,951
like doing military gigs and stuff like 
that and that was pretty beat down and 

26
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:58,250
we've had two kids since,
I think I was on the podcast and older 

27
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,400
that has beat me down to beat me down in
a different way.

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,380
So I've just been at home and I can 
train,

29
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,510
don't travel as much.
And so yeah,

30
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:08,511
everything's been pretty good.
I do this gymnastics bodies programming 

31
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:09,000
couple of days a week,
a little bit of squatting,

32
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:14,001
a little bit of dead lifting pretty on 
point with food and then just getting 

33
00:01:14,001 --> 00:01:15,360
the dog Piss beat out of me at jets,
like two to four days a week.

34
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,430
So yeah.
Yeah.

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,430
What got you into that?
Oh Man,

36
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,530
I've always been interested in martial 
arts.

37
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,910
Like as a kid I had a brown belt and 
like the Ed Parker Kenpo system.

38
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:27,820
Old School.
Yeah.

39
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,020
Old Old School Elvis Presley style.
Yes.

40
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,310
And uh,
and you know,

41
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:37,311
like I knew that Parker had some 
connections with like Bruce Lee in jkd 

42
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,460
and I was really always really 
interested in that.

43
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,910
So I went down to Long Beach,
California and ended up tracking down 

44
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,941
some folks at the Inosanto Academy and,
and sparred with a kid that had been 

45
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,340
doing tai boxing for like six months and
he was 60 pounds lighter than I was,

46
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,930
not particularly athletic.

47
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,930
And he beat the crap out of me.
I mean it was just like a man fighting a

48
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:02,451
boy.
Only I was bigger and stronger and 

49
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,071
faster and he just destroyed me.
So I went back home and I burned my 

50
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:08,451
brown belt and I started studying some 
Thai boxing and it wasn't long after 

51
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:11,961
this that I encountered Brazilian 
Jujitsu for the first time and I had a 

52
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:14,190
little bit of a high school wrestling 
background and I was a state county,

53
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,140
the California state power lifting 
champion.

54
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,960
So strong athletic kid.
And again,

55
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:22,860
like this guy like submitted me 50 times
in like two minutes.

56
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:27,120
And I was just kinda blown away.
But this was back in like [inaudible] 92

57
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:32,121
when,
unless you were in a major metropolitan 

58
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:32,121
area,
you just couldn't find Jujitsu,

59
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,260
so I did a couple of weeks of it then 
you know,

60
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:39,261
around like 92 93 and I didn't have a 
second Jujitsu session until like 2003 

61
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,661
and again it was like a month or 
something because at that point the 

62
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:45,420
folks that we're usually running these 
schools,

63
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:48,270
like they could barely keep 'em open.
They were like 9:00

64
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:50,370
in the back of a karate school or 
something.

65
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:55,371
Right.
So it's only been the past couple of 

66
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:55,371
years that I've been able to be pretty 
consistent.

67
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,090
So you just found a great gym out where 
you were at?

68
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,660
Yeah,
yeah.

69
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,260
I've kind of bounced around a little 
bit.

70
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,850
Kelly farrel,
conviction,

71
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:05,851
martial arts,
and then also the gorilla Jujitsu 

72
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:08,520
affiliate there in Reno.
And then I get out to Elko to the guys 

73
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,520
that a straight blast gym in Elko under 
Chris Meyer.

74
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,770
So you out in the Reno area?
Yeah.

75
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,330
Yeah.
I didn't know what Rena was like.

76
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,630
I went to Reno this past August and 
went,

77
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,240
I've maybe had passed through once when 
I was younger,

78
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,210
but we went through reno into the 
mountains in Nevada.

79
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,650
It's fucking beautiful.

80
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,830
It is.
It is,

81
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,210
yeah.
It's four seasons.

82
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:31,970
Like the summer's great winter was 
really cool this year.

83
00:03:31,971 --> 00:03:33,320
Good snowboarding and all that.

84
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,630
So it looks like a Colorado up there,
like,

85
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,710
do you think Nevada you think desert,
you think barren landscape?

86
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,440
Not Very pretty or pretty in those sort 
of a like,

87
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,750
hey,
you better bring water sort of a way.

88
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,450
It wasn't like that at all.
It was gorgeous.

89
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:47,680
Yeah.

90
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,840
Yeah.
Um,

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,480
it's kind of funny when people,
you know,

92
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,920
like if I'm being interviewed or 
something too,

93
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:57,921
like you live in Reno really?
Is that part of a parole violation or 

94
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,801
something that I really liked it.
The thing that is sad though is the 

95
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,580
casinos in Reno,
they're weird.

96
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,280
It's,
it's a really weird mix because you have

97
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:10,281
like Tesla and all these tech companies 
that have moved into town and it's 

98
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:10,920
really got this new vibe going on.
Yeah,

99
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:14,880
like the big tesla mega plant is out 
there kind of east of town,

100
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,100
so you've got this kind of technology 
scene,

101
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:22,101
there's a whole startup row in downtown 
Reno and then you have the casinos and 

102
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:26,901
that whole underbelly element to it.
And so these two things are like 

103
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:26,901
literally,
you know,

104
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:31,221
you change corners downtown and you're 
in either the lake super depressing,

105
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,000
you know,
like failed at the casino deal or you go

106
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,940
around the corner and there's a bunch of
guys with the technology startups,

107
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:42,180
technology startups will overwhelm the 
shitty casinos.

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,700
I still,
you know,

109
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,370
like tech in general and this is maybe 
getting off in the weeds,

110
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:52,371
but there's so much stuff that's just 
been built on speculation and eyeballs 

111
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:56,481
and nothing real that I'm still curious 
if like tech in general is going to make

112
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:57,990
it.
So yeah.

113
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,600
It's uh,
how so in what way do you know,

114
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,570
you know,
there was so much speculative money that

115
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,130
went into that scene and the,
you know,

116
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:10,131
there's only a few entities like 
facebook and Google and stuff that have 

117
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:10,560
really turned it into a money making 
venture.

118
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:15,561
And a lot of these technology startups,
there was a lot of money going into 

119
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:20,061
them,
but it was just kind of predicated on 

120
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:22,310
growth or eyeballs,
but they never really had a strategy 

121
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,801
towards profitability.
And so I'm just kinda curious how many 

122
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:25,560
of these things are really gonna gonna 
make the cut.

123
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:28,020
But it could be really good to like if 
we,

124
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,470
if that stuff tightens up and people 
really start looking at it like a 

125
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,220
legitimate business and not just 
eyeballs and bandwidth.

126
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:36,990
So it'll be interesting.
Yeah.

127
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:38,730
I've always thought that was weird about
twitter.

128
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,690
The twitter

129
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,430
has so many users and has so much.
There's so much activity,

130
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,900
there's something going on there.
Right.

131
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,540
But then they have to figure out how do 
you generate money from that.

132
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,560
Right,
right.

133
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,920
Yeah.
It's worth a lot of money,

134
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,300
but for no reason.
Right.

135
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,620
It's like God,
everybody's using it.

136
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,090
Yeah.
But what do you do with it right

137
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
now?
But I feel like someone's going to 

138
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,100
figure it out,
but I felt like that two years ago.

139
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:03,380
Right.
You know?

140
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,180
Yeah.
They stay open.

141
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,280
I have no idea.
I have no idea.

142
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,990
Like,
uh,

143
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,010
yeah,
I don't know.

144
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,130
I don't know.
I keep hearing that I'm on a shadow 

145
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,130
banned list.
You heard of that?

146
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,120
I don't believe it.
I think it's horseshit.

147
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,620
We have Jordan Peterson on,
so that probably got you on some sort of

148
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:26,621
a short latest.
I've got a bunch of people on Gavin 

149
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:27,350
McInnes is more egregious probably and 
more ridiculous.

150
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:28,820
And uh,
Steven Crowder,

151
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,630
Alex Jones is the biggest one for sure.
Right.

152
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:34,360
Did you see what the list like means 
like what it means to be on that list?

153
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,060
No,
not exactly.

154
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,080
Like you just get your tweets reviewed 
by a person before they make it out to 

155
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,080
your feet or something like that out of 
here.

156
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:40,800
Really?
Is that real?

157
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
That's what it said.
I don't know if it's real,

158
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:43,360
but that's what it said

159
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,310
most of my tweets and make it out there 
and the ones that don't.

160
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,340
Thank you.
Thank you for cut those off because it 

161
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,580
was some kind of oversight.
I'm hammered at the comedy store at 2:00

162
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,900
in the morning.
I want to rile people up for no reason.

163
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,640
So yeah,
thank you for protecting me from myself.

164
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,310
I'm kidding.
I'm not in any way advocating censorship

165
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,460
and I don't,
I'm not,

166
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,670
I'm not necessarily sure.
I believe it either.

167
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,880
Sorry about that.
Deviation of.

168
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,020
Not at all.
Not at all.

169
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,110
Yeah.
So I've been following your instagram 

170
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,061
feed and uh,
you and your wife have been doing some 

171
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,950
crazy blood sugar tests after foods,
postcard meals,

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,320
like beans and a bunch of other 
different high carb foods.

173
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,850
What are you trying to do there?
Are you on a Keto diet or what are you 

174
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:28,890
doing?
I generally run really well.

175
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Quito or pretty close to it.
I'm fueling Jujitsu is a little rough 

176
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,761
with that.
So I maybe do about 75 to 100 grams of 

177
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:40,701
carbs on harder training days.
And then other days it's pretty low 

178
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:43,581
carb.
My wife though is kind of like 

179
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:43,581
Wolverine,
like you just can't kill her.

180
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,220
And this is some of the stuff that I've 
learned in the past couple of years,

181
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:52,221
this personalized nutrition where 
there's a huge variation from person to 

182
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:52,830
person and how they respond to 
carbohydrates,

183
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,380
foods in general,
but in particular carbohydrates.

184
00:07:55,381 --> 00:08:00,381
There was a study done at the Weizmann 
Institute in Israel a couple of years 

185
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,210
ago and they basically put a continuous 
glucometer on folks.

186
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:05,700
It's a little disk that you pop on the 
back of your arm.

187
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,180
They did a full genetic screen on them,
a gut microbiome test,

188
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:14,181
and then they started feeding these 
folks different meals and the blood 

189
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:14,340
glucose responses were all over the 
place.

190
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,340
Like one person would eat rice and they 
would have a barely perceptible blood 

191
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,510
glucose increase and another person 
would be near diabetic from,

192
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,570
from beating that Rice.
And do they believe this is a genetic 

193
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,451
variability?
Is that location like where their 

194
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,180
genetic ancestors and gut microbiome 
seem to drive it?

195
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:33,900
And so if the gut is unhealthy,
then that seems to make your blood sugar

196
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,940
response worse.
And then conversely,

197
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:40,080
if you eat in a way that makes your 
blood glucose response look pretty good,

198
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:45,470
then the gut microbiome seems to shift 
towards what they consider to be a 

199
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,470
healthier profile.
Huh.

200
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,360
So now is there anything you can do to 
your Gut biome to change the glucose 

201
00:08:51,301 --> 00:08:53,640
profile?
Yes.

202
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Um,
what exactly what to do is pretty 

203
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:58,700
complex.
Like,

204
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,120
you know,
some people can have a condition called 

205
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,680
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth 
where the bacteria are basically growing

206
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:07,320
too far north in the gut essentially.

207
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,080
And then whenever you eat something with
carbs in it,

208
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,140
it makes those bacteria grow in an 
inappropriate place in inappropriate 

209
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,431
way.
And it's Kinda difficult to basically 

210
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:22,941
starve the bacteria in the fore gut and 
then feed the bacteria in the hind gut.

211
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:24,420
And there are some,
some,

212
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,220
yeah,
Chris Kresser on like,

213
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:31,221
he's one of the best people in the world
probably in dealing with stuff like 

214
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:31,221
that.
But it's,

215
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:31,610
um,
uh,

216
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,350
I'll put it like this in the last five 
years,

217
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:39,351
we've learned more about the gut 
microbiome than we knew in the previous 

218
00:09:39,351 --> 00:09:40,380
50 years.
And like literally every month that goes

219
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:45,381
by we will learn more and more and more.
But the clinical application of doing 

220
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,700
something to help somebody that's sick 
is not easy.

221
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:52,350
It's a pretty complex process.
A lot of people will experience a lot of

222
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:54,690
improvement from just kind of a low carb
diet,

223
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,340
but it doesn't work for everybody.

224
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,340
Like they may a lot of people may need 
like some herbal interventions like a 

225
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,210
garlic in and different antimicrobial 
agents that help to knock that bacterial

226
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,010
overgrowth back.
And it's a,

227
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,340
it's a pretty challenging process.
Particularly if the person is really 

228
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:13,590
sick.
Does fasting have any effect on it?

229
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,770
It can.
It can just like reduced meal frequency 

230
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,430
seems to improve the gut microbiome and 
in the overall gut health.

231
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:25,431
So this is some of the stuff that I 
think is going on with intermittent 

232
00:10:25,431 --> 00:10:28,380
fasting where instead of eating like six
or seven meals a day and just constantly

233
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:32,910
kind of keeping the gut inflamed instead
doing maybe one or two meals a day.

234
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:36,570
Pretty broad spacing seems to have some 
great benefits for folks.

235
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,380
I've been doing that thing where you 
only eat for 10 hours a day.

236
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,190
Yeah,
yeah.

237
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,410
I did a podcast with Dr Rhonda Patrick.

238
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,560
She was explaining it to me and I said,
let me give it a try and I've had some 

239
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,651
really great results.
I lost a lot of body fat almost 

240
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:51,651
immediately.
I started losing body fat from it,

241
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,080
but didn't lose any energy and don't 
feel great.

242
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:55,590
I mean,
it just,

243
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,770
everything feels really good.
But uh,

244
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,900
it's been,
it's challenging because I would come 

245
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:02,900
home from shows like late at night and 
I'd be hungry.

246
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,290
Right.
And I'm supposed to be drinking water,

247
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:04,550
like,
you know,

248
00:11:04,551 --> 00:11:07,080
he was supposed to have anything that 
your body has to metabolize,

249
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,730
right?
Yeah.

250
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,240
Even coffee will kind of cause a little 
bit of a adrenal response.

251
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,390
The liver kicks out some glucose and 
then it basically presses the reset.

252
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:20,391
But what about herbal tea?
I would think that that would probably 

253
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:20,391
be okay,
but I mean,

254
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:21,300
the folks that really know a lot about 
it,

255
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:23,460
like Rhonda Patrick Valter,
Longo,

256
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,550
they're really pretty adamant that in 
that fasting period,

257
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:28,320
like just wanting nothing but water.

258
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

259
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,370
Water is delicious when you thirsty,
but not so good for the rest of the 

260
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,380
time.
You're like,

261
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,460
oh,
it's boring ass.

262
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,461
Well,
that's why I grabbed one of these guys 

263
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:40,461
are real.
He is.

264
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:43,830
Yeah.
Via for people don't know is not a 

265
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,031
sponsor.
It's just we drink it and it's Stevia 

266
00:11:46,031 --> 00:11:46,920
flavored soda,
so it's really like a guilt free soda.

267
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,270
Right?
Which is crazy.

268
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,930
Like soda that's sweetened with plants,
right?

269
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,460
And not sweetened in a way that affects 
your blood glucose level at all.

270
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,680
Stevia can reduce blood glucose,
so in some people,

271
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:04,681
because the sweet taste,
they actually release insulin in 

272
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:08,301
response to Israeli.
Can you grab a couple of those gems and 

273
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,921
then bit thirsty,
but the downside is that if you have 

274
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:14,311
somebody that has kind of an insulin 
roller coaster can actually make that 

275
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,550
problem worse.
So the Stevie is super good.

276
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,980
I think it's a lot better than most 
artificial sweeteners,

277
00:12:17,981 --> 00:12:21,790
but there are folks that can kind of get
themselves into a bad spot with it.

278
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,620
That's interesting.
I did not know.

279
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,390
That's a.
So is it?

280
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,900
Is there like a recommended daily 
allowance of Stevia?

281
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,710
No.
Again,

282
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:32,200
this is just a really individualistic 
thing,

283
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,660
you know,
and it's something that like if somebody

284
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:39,661
is a health coach or a doctor or 
healthcare provider and they see 

285
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:40,690
somebody that's struggling with 
something and then they're like,

286
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:41,710
okay,
so how are you eating?

287
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,540
Like I'm eating low carb.
Okay.

288
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,250
So are you doing any,
uh,

289
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,870
artificial sweeteners or what have you,
and if they're doing something like this

290
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,740
then it could be something that is kind 
of kicking them out of the,

291
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,970
the,
you know,

292
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,030
the insulin regulation that would work 
better for them.

293
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,130
Hmm.
Now what do you think about colonics 

294
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,400
related?

295
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,290
No,
no,

296
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:09,080
but because I feel like it was a thing 
for awhile.

297
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,430
A lot of people were talking about 
cleaning out their intestinal tract and 

298
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:17,221
you know,
you just got to get water up there and 

299
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:19,311
flush everything out and they,
people would like literally watch the 

300
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:19,510
tube and go low.
I know what you're eating.

301
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:20,380
And I'm like,
what?

302
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,880
It always seemed odd to me.
That seems like there's generally an 

303
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,620
exit only kind of process and so yeah.
Yeah.

304
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,680
It.
Unless you're trying to do certain 

305
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:34,680
drugs,
right?

306
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,500
Right.
Certain drugs apparently are best when 

307
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
you stick them up there,
but there's a girl named neuro soup,

308
00:13:38,501 --> 00:13:39,760
I don't know if she's on youtube 
anymore,

309
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:44,761
but she had this whole detailed story 
about a dmt trip that she did was she 

310
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:50,251
took dmt upper butt and went on like 
some five hour journey into the 

311
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:53,830
Netherworld because it goes directly 
into your bloodstream from there,

312
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:54,220
right?

313
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,210
Yeah.
It's that base.

314
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:59,920
And so you've got a [inaudible] deal to 
like with your hand that base kind of an

315
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,830
asshole or talking about you making that
hand signal.

316
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,350
But I always wondered if it was good for
you.

317
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:10,351
I'm like,
I just feel like you should leave that 

318
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:12,320
area.
Like flooding water up there just 

319
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,320
doesn't seem like the smartest move.
Yeah,

320
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,550
it seems like just skipping a meal here 
and there and just kind of letting it do

321
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,490
its natural business seems like a pretty
good thing.

322
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,950
The people that I encountered that did 
clonics,

323
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,350
they seem to be on kind of a merry go 
round with it.

324
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,080
And they also were into some other 
really squirrely,

325
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,440
stopped like it,
uh,

326
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,350
like healing,
healing and shock rose in it.

327
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:37,351
Um,
it's just seemed like they were always 

328
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:40,951
moving towards something and never 
really getting there and so it just 

329
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:45,331
seemed odd,
like there was never like a resolution 

330
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:47,761
to the situation and I kind of like 
having some endpoints and then move on 

331
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,060
and do something else.

332
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,270
I always get very curious of something 
or very sort of,

333
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,120
I guess skeptical is the right word,
but have something that doesn't have any

334
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,150
research behind it.
So that's why I wanted to know like how 

335
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,190
much research is there behind Kalanick 
because I don't,

336
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,760
I never hear about any.
I've never dug into it.

337
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:09,761
So I honestly don't know.
I do know that there have been some 

338
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,390
studies looking at the gut microbiome,
like when they do a,

339
00:15:11,391 --> 00:15:12,980
uh,
a colonoscopy,

340
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,080
so they'll,
they'll kind of flush it out and they'll

341
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,060
give you some stuff to move everything 
out.

342
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,600
And there is some research that suggests
that's not great for the gut micro or 

343
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,650
for the,
the lower gut microbiome that there's 

344
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,440
actually some pathological changes from 
that.

345
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:31,760
So going in and getting a colonoscopy 
and all of the like strafed bombing that

346
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:34,180
they do to move everything out may not 
be that great.

347
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:38,770
It's a great way to put it.
Brave thinking about fighter plane.

348
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,070
Totally.
Agent Orange.

349
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,580
Um,
well I know that people that have 

350
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,080
antibiotics that like people that are 
battering battling staph infection have 

351
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,430
a horrendous time sort of reconstructing
their gut biome.

352
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,400
And Rhonda Patrick detailed that on one 
of the podcasts that we did,

353
00:15:55,401 --> 00:16:00,401
she had a tremendous,
a staph infection and it route it 

354
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:05,070
wouldn't go away.
And she actually wound up one of the 

355
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,660
things that really helped.
It was a topical application of garlic.

356
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,680
Yeah,
yeah,

357
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,450
yeah.
Which is really interesting.

358
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,870
Yeah.
A garlic Oregano.

359
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,940
There's a lot of these traditional oil 
Oregano oil and like the Oregano oil and

360
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:21,941
the garlic are really potent in general.
They kind of spare the healthy bacteria 

361
00:16:21,941 --> 00:16:22,910
are what we would call the more 
beneficial bacteria,

362
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:28,270
but even that's not a universal story.
Like it can suppress some of the more 

363
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,230
beneficial bacteria in some situations.
So again,

364
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:33,650
this is where if you think you've got 
something going on,

365
00:16:33,651 --> 00:16:38,651
it's probably smart to work with 
somebody that knows a little bit about 

366
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:39,020
what they're doing so that you've got a 
protocol,

367
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,820
you can test it,
see what the results are,

368
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:44,960
and then we can make some decisions 
based off that because you could really,

369
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,850
you know,
if you're already in a compromised state

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,650
and then you throw something like that 
in,

371
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:49,790
you can end up worse.

372
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,770
Now,
for people that are listening,

373
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:56,771
who would someone go to,
like say if you really wanted to get 

374
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:57,710
your gut biome checked out?
I mean,

375
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:59,940
someone like Chris Kresser,
uh,

376
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,080
there's a gal in Austin,
Amy Myers,

377
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:07,670
there's a Dr Ruscio up in the bay area.
Chris Kresser also has a,

378
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,750
uh,
the Kresser Institute or re certifying 

379
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,741
healthcare practitioners.
These are the folks that you want to 

380
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:14,741
check out.
Also,

381
00:17:14,741 --> 00:17:16,520
the Institute of Functional Medicine is 
a really good place.

382
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:21,521
Most of the doctors and healthcare 
providers that go through that 

383
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,180
functional medicine training are really 
well versed in looking at the,

384
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,670
uh,
this whole gut microbiome story.

385
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:26,780
But he,
interestingly,

386
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:31,781
they kind of pull it back and they've 
got this kind of evolutionary biology 

387
00:17:31,781 --> 00:17:33,050
picture that they look at,
so they're thinking about sleep and your

388
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,930
food and stress levels,
social connectivity,

389
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:41,290
and they really put all that stuff 
together in a pretty good way and 

390
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,650
they're not chasing symptoms are really 
trying to figure out root cause and then

391
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:45,500
try to address that root cause and move 
forward and they're pretty.

392
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,100
They're pretty good at figuring out like
you've got 18 things going,

393
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,440
which,
which is the one thing we need to 

394
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,181
address first and then we'll knock that 
out and go to the next one and the next 

395
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:57,810
one.
And now when they start applying,

396
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,840
say like probiotics are,
there are all probiotics are created 

397
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,830
equal in terms of like foods,
not in terms of like supplementation,

398
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:09,831
because I know there's some really 
intense a probiotic supplements you can 

399
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:12,870
buy that you have to keep refrigerated 
right now.

400
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,240
Again,
there's huge variability in that.

401
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,090
You have some people that when they add 
probiotics,

402
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:22,110
like just like Kimchi or Sauerkraut,
improve immediately liked their clinical

403
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:23,910
symptoms improved.
They feel better,

404
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,360
maybe depressive symptoms improve.
They get leaner and then you have other 

405
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,450
people that everything they have going 
on get to worse,

406
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,810
and these are the folks that you start 
wondering if they have some small 

407
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:35,810
intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

408
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Do they add some reactivity?
There's these things called fodmaps are 

409
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,460
fermentable carbohydrates that can,
you know,

410
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:46,461
make the gut microbiome kind of freak 
out and there's another layer to this 

411
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:48,390
which is called small intestinal fungal 
overgrowth.

412
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:53,780
So there are people out there that have 
some sort of a persistent fungal 

413
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,580
infection which doesn't get picked up 
and the general gut microbiome screening

414
00:18:56,581 --> 00:18:58,710
because they're looking at bacteria and 
fungus.

415
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,040
So this is a whole other layer to the 
story that people may have had a year's 

416
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:09,321
long decades long fungal infection in 
the gut that is then disordering 

417
00:19:09,321 --> 00:19:11,640
everything causing inflammation and 
those are really,

418
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,880
really difficult to deal with.
What does one do when they have a fungal

419
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,940
overgrowth?
You can do some of the antifungals like 

420
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,870
Diflucan and and again some of the 
herbal preparations,

421
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,330
but this is another layer,
you know,

422
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:29,331
kind of peeling the onion that there 
aren't that many practitioners that are 

423
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:32,991
even looking for that as an option and 
then the treatment protocols are not 

424
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,600
super well edited out.

425
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,970
So there's a lot of experimentation that
happens there.

426
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,250
Do they know what?
Is there a dietary cause?

427
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,390
I mean there's always an influence on 
the diet,

428
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,710
but you know,
you could,

429
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,590
you know,
refined carbohydrates makes all this 

430
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,270
stuff grow better and it disrupts the 
normal gut flora.

431
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,730
It causes inflammation,
but you know,

432
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:56,400
oftentimes people will go on a round of 
antibiotics.

433
00:19:56,401 --> 00:20:00,600
The bacterial population gets pushed 
down and then the fungal population,

434
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:05,601
which is always there,
but usually it's in some sort of a 

435
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:06,390
symbiotic balance with the other 
microbes than the,

436
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,350
the fungal infection or fungal 
population can increase.

437
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:14,320
And this is where some people will go on
a round of antibiotics and then they end

438
00:20:14,321 --> 00:20:17,580
up with some sort of a legitimate fungal
infection.

439
00:20:17,581 --> 00:20:22,581
You know,
like they can see it on their skin and 

440
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:22,581
the doctor will prescribe some 
antifungals for that,

441
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:26,961
but you can also have this happening 
kind of a low grade sub acute level 

442
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,900
where it's not bad enough where they're 
getting rashes and hives,

443
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:34,620
but it's bad enough that it's making 
them sick and not kind of optimized.

444
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,130
Wow.
It's just so hard to figure out what's 

445
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,441
going on with you unless you.
I mean it seems like for the average 

446
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,800
person that has a full time job and 
family and all that jazz,

447
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,340
it's probably incredibly difficult to 
get to the bottom of what your health 

448
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,140
issue is.
It definitely can be,

449
00:20:50,141 --> 00:20:55,141
you know,
the average time for diagnosis of an 

450
00:20:55,141 --> 00:20:57,670
autoimmune condition or something like 
celiac disease is like 12 to 15 years,

451
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,970
so people are suffering.
They're suffering for a long time and 

452
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,691
it's not the easiest thing in the world 
to pin down because the symptoms are so 

453
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:09,520
variable from person to person.
Now if you go to a good doc,

454
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,760
particularly someone,
again kind of functional medicine 

455
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,490
training or they've got a little bit of 
this evolutionary biology perspective,

456
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:20,491
they usually ask a set of questions and 
more questions so that they can kind of 

457
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:24,991
narrow down what's going on,
but if you're kind of doing the doc in 

458
00:21:24,991 --> 00:21:25,780
the box deal and you've got five minutes
with this person,

459
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:30,781
like they're just trying to figure out 
what's the script I'm going to write so 

460
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:30,880
I can move this person out and get to 
the next person.

461
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Yeah,
that's unfortunate and you're just not 

462
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,080
going to.
Unless you get lucky,

463
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,640
you're not going to figure out what the 
issue is.

464
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,940
Yeah.
It would seem that the amount of time 

465
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,831
required to figure out what's wrong with
the person would also be very expensive 

466
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:46,090
and likely not covered by a whole lot of
healthcare plans.

467
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,450
Yeah,
I mean it's interesting like some of 

468
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,180
these functional medicine docs do a lot 
with pretty little,

469
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,720
you know,
but some of what they're doing is a time

470
00:21:55,721 --> 00:22:00,721
investment.
Like they'll do a two hour history and 

471
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:03,781
the.
If they can get the information the 

472
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:03,781
last.
So you know,

473
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:06,190
what was your in utero environment like,
like did your mom meet?

474
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,200
Well,
did they smoke when you were born?

475
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:11,260
Was it a vaginal birth or csection?
Were you breastfed or not?

476
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,710
When was your,
uh,

477
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,750
the approximate age of your first round 
of antibiotics?

478
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:20,280
Did you ever go on tetracycline for 
extended period of time for acne?

479
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:25,281
And so they'll build a really 
comprehensive early life history and 

480
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:28,030
then try to March this thing forward in 
the last few questions,

481
00:22:28,031 --> 00:22:32,080
like did you ever travel out of country?
Did you get some sort of a gut bug while

482
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:37,081
doing that?
So there are some really important 

483
00:22:37,081 --> 00:22:39,391
pieces but a well trained a practitioner
will rely a lot on the intake and then 

484
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:44,260
that will kind of inform where they go 
with the testing.

485
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:49,261
And so the testing might be a little bit
expensive but you're not just casting 

486
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:52,921
around blindly.
Like because of that really thorough 

487
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:54,790
intake and kind of understanding the 
early life history and trying to fair it

488
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:59,791
out.
If there's ever been like a big event 

489
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:00,010
that could be linked back to this health
crisis,

490
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,830
then they can really dial in the 
testing.

491
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,660
Then depending on what they get from 
that,

492
00:23:04,661 --> 00:23:06,190
they can make a treatment protocol.

493
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,410
Try the treatment protocol.
If we have success,

494
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:09,550
then good to go.
If not,

495
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:14,551
then we start modifying from there.
When you say eating foods out of the 

496
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:18,520
country and catching some sort of a 
bacterial infection out of that,

497
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,560
that is one of the scariest things in 
the world to me because I've watched 

498
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:23,560
that stupid show too many times.
Right.

499
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,930
What are the enemy within or something 
like that.

500
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:28,450
Yeah.
It's hard to think of your body as being

501
00:23:28,451 --> 00:23:32,080
like not just an organism but a whole 
ecosystem.

502
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,270
Right.
Right.

503
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,490
And,
and stuff can come in and take up 

504
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:38,490
residence in new.
Didn't really want it.

505
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,270
Yeah.
I had grd at twice.

506
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,980
Oh really?
And it's um,

507
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,190
it's bad.
It's bad news that uh,

508
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,470
the first time I snorkeling and Mexico.

509
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Oh Jesus.
And so everybody in the main snorkeling 

510
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,461
group was kind of out in the salt water 
and then there was nobody over in this 

511
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:54,530
other area.
And so I was like,

512
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,140
I'll swim over here.
But apparently there was a,

513
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,910
it was an estuary,
like there was a salt water,

514
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,970
fresh water interface.
And so I started swimming in the fresh 

515
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:04,970
water and then they were like,
yeah,

516
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,401
you're really not supposed to swim in 
there because this water out of a c no 

517
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:12,300
tay.
And like sometimes what's the c note to 

518
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:12,300
the,
uh,

519
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,310
the underground.
I'm kind of fresh water springs that 

520
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:18,941
come out of a limestone.
I interrupted you when you were saying 

521
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:19,280
people take Thompson out water dumping 
the water.

522
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:20,300
Yeah.
Oh boy.

523
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,230
Yeah,
yeah.

524
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,980
I know you get the Rda from beaver poop.
That is another place.

525
00:24:24,981 --> 00:24:29,981
Yeah.
And I don't know that there are beaver 

526
00:24:29,981 --> 00:24:31,451
in the Yucatan,
but there's some other carriers in 

527
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:33,020
Prince of Wales island once about a year
and a half ago,

528
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:38,021
two years ago,
and it's really high up and it's above 

529
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:38,270
the line where beavers are.

530
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,920
And so you could take a water bottle and
dip it into a lake and just drink it out

531
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:46,160
of the lake and you feel it's so 
dangerous feeling,

532
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,640
but they assured us they like,
you can absolutely drink right out of 

533
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:51,640
that lake.
Oh Man.

534
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,230
That gives me a little gut rumblings 
even thinking about it.

535
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,750
And we had a float plane land on that 
very lake.

536
00:24:56,751 --> 00:24:58,490
And I'm like,
what are the things leaking in the leg?

537
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:00,580
I'm drinking diesel water.
And they're like,

538
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,770
there's millions of gallons of water.
And it's like,

539
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,160
whatever.
This is not going to affect you.

540
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:05,720
I'm like,
it says it says you.

541
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,630
What if I scoop it right where the thing
dropped off?

542
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:10,760
It's diesel fuel.
I don't know,

543
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,010
but it just seems weird that you can do 
that.

544
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:18,011
And then it seems even weirder when you 
think about the fact that you can't do 

545
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:18,011
that everywhere that most.

546
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:22,240
Even though we're a giant percentage of 
us as water really can't drink most 

547
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,870
water rate.
My professor Loren Cordain,

548
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:26,510
the guy who kind of founded this Paleo 
Diet concept,

549
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:29,530
he used to be a lifeguard at Lake Tahoe,
you know,

550
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,610
30 years ago,
35 years ago,

551
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,380
and they would jump off the pier,
dive down where it was super deep,

552
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,510
really cold,
open up their water bottle,

553
00:25:38,511 --> 00:25:39,860
fill it up,
swing back up,

554
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:41,660
drink it,
and you can't do it now because the lake

555
00:25:41,661 --> 00:25:44,570
has ge already in it and a bunch of 
other weird things that happened.

556
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,190
Well for him,
nothing,

557
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,680
nothing would happen to the lake.
More people moving in and just,

558
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,610
you know,
it's just kind of a volume of poor input

559
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,920
at some point.
Kind of overwhelms the natural.

560
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,220
We suck.
We fucking ruined everything.

561
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,050
Damn people.
I mean,

562
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:08,051
most,
most indigenous cultures were savvy to 

563
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:08,640
the idea that you didn't take a dump and
your own water systems.

564
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,750
So yeah.
Well they knew about parasites for sure.

565
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,750
I mean that was always a whole idea 
about not eating pigs.

566
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:16,820
All the religious.
Excuse me,

567
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:21,821
all the religious rules about not eating
pigs was a big part of it was because 

568
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,050
pigs eat almost everything.
Right?

569
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,080
Everything that's on the ground and they
would eat something that has chicken 

570
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,080
gnosis in it.
People would get really,

571
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,760
really sick from eating pigs.
So they had sort of determined that pigs

572
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,530
were evil,
right in shellfish.

573
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:35,420
Similar.
Good friend of mine,

574
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:40,421
John Durant did a book called the Paleo 
Manifesto and he actually has a really 

575
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:45,461
interesting background,
has kind of a pretty deep kind of 

576
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:45,461
religious studies

577
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:49,160
background and he would talk about some 
of these food prohibitions in different 

578
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,170
religions and then what we know about it
today.

579
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:57,171
And so things like shellfish.
You ever once while we get something 

580
00:26:57,171 --> 00:27:00,321
like red tide or you know,
the diatom overgrowth and these are 

581
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,930
filter feeders would pull all this stuff
in and then get loaded up with a toxin 

582
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,010
and it would kill you if you ate it.
And so these food prohibitions really 

583
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,340
had some pretty good wisdom to them in 
general.

584
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,980
But then there's also super goofy 
things,

585
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,200
but it's pretty common across all 
cultures.

586
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,740
Like people would,
you know,

587
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,760
kind of build into their systems,
these prohibitions against different 

588
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,760
foods.
And oftentimes because of this,

589
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,530
uh,
kind of bacterial or,

590
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,590
or a parasitic deal,
I wonder what,

591
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,050
like the kosher ones for like and meat,
milk and meat together.

592
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,150
You can't have milk meet together.

593
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,760
I wonder what that's about.
I would have to ask him about that.

594
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,920
I,
I never heard anything about that.

595
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:41,100
And then it's interesting in Islam than 
there's not that prohibition.

596
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,160
So.
And I don't know if that was just kind 

597
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,160
of like a fuck you to the Judeo 
Christian deal or what?

598
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Yeah.
Now what about eating fats with complex 

599
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,070
carbohydrates or fats with sugars?
Um,

600
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:58,290
does that affect your,
your glucose levels like,

601
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:01,020
and how it's absorbed by the body?
Yes.

602
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,880
But again,
like from person to person,

603
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,520
it really varies a lot.
So for some people,

604
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,790
you know,
if you did something like a white potato

605
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,820
and you're going to have a certain blood
glucose response from it and you put a 

606
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,730
good whack of butter or olive oil or 
something in it,

607
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,180
for one group of people,
it would actually reduce or spread out 

608
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:20,910
the total glucose load.

609
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,910
So your blood sugar wouldn't go is high.
Your total insulin load would be lesser 

610
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,460
as a consequence and then there are 
other groups of folks that they will see

611
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,520
an increase in blood glucose response 
and a really pronounced increase in 

612
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,080
insulin response and is the the amount 
of fats that are in like the olive oil 

613
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:44,781
and the butter that's in the potato is a
uniform or they're measuring it very 

614
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:45,660
carefully to the studies that had been 
done.

615
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,860
They're quite uniform.
Yeah,

616
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:48,970
like to get in and do a pretty good job,
so they're,

617
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,450
you know,
person needs x amount of carbohydrate,

618
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:56,451
they add x amount of fat there kind of 
standardized for body weight so that 

619
00:28:56,451 --> 00:28:59,130
you're diluting the glucose about the 
same amount from person to person.

620
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:04,610
And so the.
The best understanding that I've seen 

621
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,001
out of this is just that there's a 
pretty good variability from person to 

622
00:29:08,001 --> 00:29:08,430
person as to how they're gonna respond 
to that.

623
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,880
So it's not always a case where adding 
fat to a decently dense carbohydrate 

624
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:18,150
source is going to buy you anything.
For some people it is an improvement and

625
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:20,100
for other people it's actually more of a
problem.

626
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,280
So you'd almost have to do like kind of 
experienced the experiments that you're 

627
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,060
doing with your wife,
where you take the blood levels post,

628
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,800
what are you doing,
like what time periods.

629
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:32,630
So you do it for the recommendation and 
it's called the seven day Carb,

630
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,580
tested you 50 grams of carbs and that's 
the net carb.

631
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:40,581
So all the fiber subtracted out and so 
if you're doing something like black 

632
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:41,260
beans,
it's a huge pile of beans because have a

633
00:29:41,261 --> 00:29:43,750
lot of protein and fiber.
So those things are hard to do.

634
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Something white rice,
White Rice or you know like gluten free 

635
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:49,080
bread or something would be a lot easier
to do,

636
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,110
but you consume that.

637
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,260
You set your timer for when you're done 
with the meal.

638
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,320
Two hours later you check your blood 
glucose and for my methods I'd like to 

639
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,800
see that two hour mark probably under 
150 milligrams per deciliter for folks,

640
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,210
which is pretty conservative.
But when we look at again,

641
00:30:07,211 --> 00:30:10,300
some a pre agricultural people,
they tend to have some really,

642
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:13,540
Really Nice Blood Glucose responses.
And again,

643
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:18,541
from this weitzman paper,
what we saw from that is if people 

644
00:30:18,541 --> 00:30:20,650
control their blood glucose effectively,
over time the inflammation drops,

645
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:25,651
their gut microbiome improves.
And so you could have two people that 

646
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:28,870
have a very different response to say 
like rice or potatoes or something.

647
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,330
And one person like my wife,
it's kind of crazy.

648
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:34,090
Like she can just crush this stuff and 
she does great.

649
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:37,270
And interestingly she can eat a 
ketogenic diet and do great.

650
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:42,300
Like she just Kinda,
she can switch whatever fuels she wants 

651
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,300
to,
she does fine with that.

652
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:47,070
But if we keep that Gut microbiome or 
the blood glucose response pretty 

653
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:52,231
consistently good than even someone like
me that kind of like pulled the genetic 

654
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:53,750
short card in the lottery.
Like I don't,

655
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,110
I don't know exactly what is wrong with 
me,

656
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:59,200
but I don't handle carbs that well.
Um,

657
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:03,310
if I eat in a way that my blood glucose 
response looks like my wife,

658
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,320
that my blood lipids look good and my 
gut is healthier.

659
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,160
Like everything else pulls into a good 
spot.

660
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,210
So even if you're not,
um,

661
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:16,470
you know,
from that genetically talented side of 

662
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,141
things,
if you can make your blood glucose 

663
00:31:19,141 --> 00:31:19,141
response look like that genetically 
talented person,

664
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,730
then you should get most of the 
metabolic benefits.

665
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:24,190
You don't have as much latitude in your 
day to day eating.

666
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,170
But I mean,
you,

667
00:31:25,171 --> 00:31:30,171
you know,
not everybody can flatfoot dunk a 

668
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:30,400
basketball or something,
so you just have to take what you get.

669
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,450
Yeah.
That's interesting.

670
00:31:31,451 --> 00:31:34,720
So you just have to kind of figure out 
what it is that your body requires.

671
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:38,560
And the main goal is staying inside 
these parameters.

672
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:39,370
Right?
Right.

673
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:39,970
And you know,
it's,

674
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,720
it's a tough thing for someone like me.
You like I love the Paleo Diet,

675
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,990
I love that basic concept and I don't.
In general,

676
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,020
if you throw out the following,
would you say most people should eat 

677
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,800
whole unprocessed foods?
Not a lot of contention there,

678
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,280
you know,
but when you get a little bit granular 

679
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,500
with that whole unprocessed foods,
could be beans,

680
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,450
it could be potatoes,
sweet potatoes.

681
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,000
And for me it's interesting like 
lentils,

682
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,940
I do great width,
I can do a lot of lentils,

683
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,220
do a decent amount of carbohydrate from 
lentils.

684
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:12,670
My Blood Glucose response is great if I 
do rice,

685
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:15,520
white potatoes,
sweet potatoes are better.

686
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,170
But you know,
the rice and white potatoes,

687
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,990
I looked like a diabetic after eating 
that stuff.

688
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,630
So,
um,

689
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,940
you know,
even though that general recommendation 

690
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:27,610
of eat whole unprocessed foods is 
generally spot on,

691
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,460
there's still a lot of details and 
granularity in that,

692
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,800
you know,
you could be following a whole food diet

693
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:36,040
and for you,
because of your genetics or epigenetics,

694
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:39,860
like your gut or maybe taking 
antibiotics in the past,

695
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:45,310
you still may need to be really careful 
about the amounts and types of 

696
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,430
carbohydrates that you eat.
That's crazy.

697
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,270
Taking antibiotics in the past can 
affect you that far in the future.

698
00:32:50,271 --> 00:32:52,750
Like how,
how much of an effect like time wise.

699
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,660
So there's two levels to this in my 
opinion.

700
00:32:56,661 --> 00:32:59,630
The one level is the gut microbiome.
There's another level to it.

701
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:01,490
Certain antibiotics,
the way that they work,

702
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:06,491
they interrupt the transcription and in 
activity of the ribosomes in bacteria.

703
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,900
But our mitochondria are effectively a 
bacteria,

704
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:16,901
like they have bacterial DNA in 
ribosomes and even though in general,

705
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:22,451
like mainstream medicine says that 
antibiotics don't effect mitochondrial 

706
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:22,451
function.

707
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,260
There's some pretty good papers that 
suggest that antibiotics can disrupt and

708
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:31,100
damage mitochondrial function.
And when your Mitochondria gets sick,

709
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:36,101
you die.
Like this is so much of what Rhonda 

710
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:36,101
Patrick Talks about with,
you know,

711
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:40,121
the benefits of fasting and having 
really good micro nutrient density and 

712
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:43,481
whatnot.
And you know what Tim Ferriss pinged me 

713
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:46,340
a question about why is lyme disease has
gotten so much worse for people,

714
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,150
you know,
use to.

715
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,460
It was kind of like catching a cold,
you know,

716
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,160
a lived in upstate New York.
Everybody seemed to get it.

717
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:55,430
It wasn't something that would cripple 
people over the long haul.

718
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,220
And now you're seeing a lot of longterm 
problems.

719
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,460
But my question was,
is it really the lyme disease or is it 

720
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,320
the damage to the Mitochondria from 
being on antibiotics longterm?

721
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:10,350
Because the lyme disease requires a 
really long treatment protocol with 

722
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,300
antibiotics.
That's fascinating.

723
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,840
But isn't it even worse for people that 
go misdiagnosed?

724
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,200
And so they don't get on the antibiotics
for a long time and the lyme disease 

725
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,200
gets deep,
deep,

726
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,540
deep into their system.
Yeah.

727
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:23,360
I honestly,
I don't know much on that side.

728
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,630
I've been looking so much at this kind 
of mitochondrial dysfunction side.

729
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,620
I can't really comment much on like the 
longterm untreated lyme disease.

730
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,290
Lyme disease is a scary thing because 
there's so many ticks that have it now.

731
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,970
I was talking to some people this 
weekend and they were like,

732
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:38,970
yeah,
my mom's got it.

733
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:40,490
My Dad's got it.
I got it.

734
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,520
You know,
how many Goddamn people are getting lit 

735
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,120
up by these ticks and catching this 
little freaky disease.

736
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:49,310
And where was it 20,
30 years ago,

737
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,090
you know,
it's funny.

738
00:34:50,091 --> 00:34:52,720
Npr just had a piece on this and it was,
uh,

739
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,760
some of the modern farming practices has
killed off the predators that would 

740
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,350
normally knock the tick population down.

741
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,970
Like what I,
I forget,

742
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:02,380
you know,
I,

743
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,450
I literally just kind of scanned it,
but uh,

744
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,170
somebody that commented on,
they're like,

745
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:11,230
oh yeah,
this is why we have free range chickens 

746
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,230
on her property to basically keep the 
tick population down.

747
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:16,110
But part of what is suppressing that is 
that the free range chickens are eating 

748
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,590
mice and stuff.
So the mice are a vector that allows the

749
00:35:18,591 --> 00:35:21,110
ticks to,
to grow and populate.

750
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:22,690
So the,
you know,

751
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,140
I just scanned this thing,
but it was,

752
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,170
it was interesting,
but it was suggesting that the kind of 

753
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,891
mono cropping process of what we've done
with modern agriculture has created this

754
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,240
gap where we now have pes like Mammalian
pest,

755
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:38,100
like mice and moles that

756
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,100
are a vector for the ticks.
And so they've just got more surface 

757
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,100
area,
more more uh,

758
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,490
uh,
real estate that they can live on.

759
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:49,491
And so their population has grown.
That's a really important factor for 

760
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:53,361
people that don't like coyotes.
Like there's a lot of people that are 

761
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,150
very angry that coyote coyote ate my 
dog.

762
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,130
Like I understand.
And it is terrible.

763
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:57,400
However,
the coyote,

764
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:59,180
he also eats every rat,
right?

765
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:04,181
You can find,
and that's one of the reasons why rats 

766
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:04,181
aren't everywhere.
And if you go to New York City,

767
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:06,740
you see very few coyotes and I'll fuck 
load of rats.

768
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:12,170
And what would you rather have?
I think I'd rather have a few coyotes 

769
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,901
every now and then the occasional loss 
cat then fucking black plague running 

770
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:14,901
through your neighborhood in the 
suburbs.

771
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:15,900
It's true.
But uh,

772
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,820
they have eaten three of my cats in 
Reno,

773
00:36:17,821 --> 00:36:19,740
so I do smoke a lot.

774
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,390
How do you get them archery or with a 
suppressed rifle?

775
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,700
Awhile.
Doors.

776
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,310
Do you know that when you kill coyotes 
you actually increased the population?

777
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,360
Yeah.
It's no head off and yeah,

778
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:34,320
I,
I know,

779
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:38,100
but that's the reason why there's 
coyotes in every single state.

780
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,270
And we have a podcast coming up with a 
guy named Dan Flores who,

781
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:47,271
uh,
wrote a book called Coyote America that 

782
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:47,271
I read.
It's fucking amazing.

783
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,200
But coyotes,
when they yell out what they're doing,

784
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,130
all that stuff is,
they're doing roll call and they all 

785
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,250
chime in.
And when one is missing,

786
00:36:56,251 --> 00:37:00,420
it triggers a response in the female to 
produce more cubs.

787
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:02,490
Interesting.
So in healthy conditions,

788
00:37:02,491 --> 00:37:07,491
when they're not being pressured,
the female will produce like three or 

789
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:08,520
few cups.
When they are being pressured,

790
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:13,521
they'll produce like a dozen or more.
It's crazy lake and spread out to change

791
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,730
their area.

792
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,090
Humans will be long gone and coyotes and
cockroaches will still be here.

793
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,770
They will inherit the earth.
Yeah.

794
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:24,830
Well,
it's also amazing how many native 

795
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,860
American myths and stories evolved,
uh,

796
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,190
about the coyote and about how the 
coyote was this sort of God that was 

797
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:34,641
kind of watching over everything and was
responsible for creation and a lot of 

798
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:38,091
other things like really weird,
freaky smart little animal is a wolf 

799
00:37:38,091 --> 00:37:38,400
too,
by the way.

800
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,780
Yeah.
So I,

801
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:44,781
I had read some stuff about the Coi wolf
where the wolf populations had been 

802
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:47,580
really pushed back and so they started 
crossbreeding with coyotes.

803
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:50,760
And so now we're coyotes were maybe 
about like 25,

804
00:37:50,761 --> 00:37:54,210
30 pounds now there'll be 70 or 80 
pounds and they hunt in packs.

805
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:56,940
And so they've got these characteristics
of wolves and coyotes.

806
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,941
And quite a few of them,
but one of the things that's important 

807
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:02,670
is that coyotes,
when a coyote and wolf breed,

808
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,380
they're basically the same animal.

809
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,800
So even though there's variations in the
way they behave,

810
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,010
particularly in that,
coyotes can hunt alone and they can hunt

811
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:16,011
in packs.
Whereas Wolf's almost exclusively hunt 

812
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:16,011
in packs.
Right?

813
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:16,011
The,
um,

814
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:16,200
they shared DNA.
So the,

815
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,240
when they have babies,
they're viable.

816
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,950
Right.
So it's not like a hybrid.

817
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,840
Right.
They're basically the same animal.

818
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,550
It's really weird.
Yeah.

819
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,600
Yeah.
They're everywhere.

820
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:27,210
They're apparently they're having a real
issue with them in New York City.

821
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,090
You have them in central park.
They have them in Queens.

822
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,450
Yeah.
The urban areas are some of the most 

823
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:35,900
vibrant locations for the coyotes.
Yeah.

824
00:38:35,901 --> 00:38:38,440
And I mean they just crush like,
uh,

825
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,670
the,
the,

826
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,960
uh,
the pet population.

827
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,810
Like you love your pets out at night.
Like you're,

828
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,220
it's Russian roulette with that.
It is,

829
00:38:45,221 --> 00:38:48,730
it's even though the day man,
I have chickens and I had one chicken,

830
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:53,731
one of my chickens got stolen by a 
coyote and I watched him hop the fence 

831
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:54,430
with it in his mouth and I was like,
wow.

832
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:59,500
It turned out her mouth.
It turned out she was a female and she 

833
00:38:59,500 --> 00:38:59,500
had cubs.
Oh Wow.

834
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,470
Yeah.
And I was trying to figure out what to 

835
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:03,470
do.
I just kind of let it alone.

836
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:06,841
I was going to kill her.
I was going to figure out a way to kill 

837
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:06,841
her,
but then I thought,

838
00:39:06,841 --> 00:39:08,320
well if I kill her then the like part of
it,

839
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:11,170
I don't want the babies grow up and kill
my chickens more.

840
00:39:11,171 --> 00:39:14,380
But then the other thing is I don't want
to stop a mother from feeding.

841
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,290
Right.
I felt like I fucked up.

842
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:21,640
Like I didn't secure the yard enough.
It was my fault and there's a game being

843
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:25,480
played in the game is stay alive and the
chickens are playing away.

844
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,970
Easier version of stay alive and the 
coyote is.

845
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,950
So I felt like I had to give her that 
point.

846
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,770
Right.
All right.

847
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:34,330
You got that one on the board.
Don't eat my fucking dog.

848
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,230
I will.
I'll kill you.

849
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:36,240
All right.
You know,

850
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,990
that's,
that's where it crosses the line.

851
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:39,400
Like my,
my appreciation,

852
00:39:39,401 --> 00:39:44,200
love for my chickens is,
is a 1000th of my cat.

853
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,250
You know what I mean?
Right.

854
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:45,940
So it's different.
Yeah.

855
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,020
Well my wife convinced me to get a 
Rhodesian ridgeback.

856
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,450
Oh,
those are the dog and he's a great dog.

857
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:57,451
He's about 105 pounds and two percent 
body fat and I wouldn't want them 

858
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:01,981
getting mixed up in a pack of coyotes,
but I think he could probably hold his 

859
00:40:01,981 --> 00:40:04,570
own for a good bit if,
if something went down sneaky though,

860
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,570
one of them will come out and they'll 
like taunt them.

861
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,190
Right.
And then they'll chase them and then the

862
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:14,191
other ones we'll ambush or like if the 
female lou the coyote is is a fertile at

863
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:20,011
that point and either pumping out the 
pheromones in the lure or the dog away 

864
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:20,011
and they're like,
yeah,

865
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:24,151
you didn't get any action and we're 
gonna eat you a great story that this 

866
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:27,751
guy told me who worked at my pet food 
store and he also works as a nurse in a 

867
00:40:27,751 --> 00:40:32,611
veterinary office and they brought this 
pit bull and it was one of those freak 

868
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:34,420
pitbulls that people breed and get it to
like 120 pounds.

869
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:35,770
Have you ever seen those?
There's A.

870
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,920
There's a company called land of the 
giants and I think they're in 

871
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,250
Massachusetts and they make these pit 
bulls that look like bodybuilders.

872
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,200
They don't even look real.
Anyway,

873
00:40:44,201 --> 00:40:49,201
this guy had a pit bull like that and 
they brought it into the vet's office 

874
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:53,131
and it was just covered in massive cuts.
It required something in the range of a 

875
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,780
thousand plus stitches all over its 
body.

876
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,130
And they're like,
what happened?

877
00:40:57,131 --> 00:40:58,210
He goes,
I don't know.

878
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:02,020
That dog got out of the yard.
And he's just just covered insurance.

879
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:04,990
They figured maybe it was a dog fight or
something they didn't know,

880
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:10,410
but there was just a trail of blood that
lead from his house up into the hills 

881
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,470
where he found nine dead.
Coyotes smokes.

882
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:19,530
Yeah.
So they just laid a trap for him and he 

883
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,970
just fucked him all up like a huge 
mistake.

884
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:27,460
And he brought this freak,
this brock Lesnar pit bull into our 

885
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:27,930
midst.
And he just mauled in.

886
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,100
The whole family is gone now.
Everyone's dead.

887
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,170
He killed them all.
He tore them apart,

888
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,880
like in apparently they just kept 
fighting.

889
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,200
I don't,
I don't know what happened,

890
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:38,470
but he said it was spread out,
you know,

891
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,240
the carnage was spread out over several 
yards.

892
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,100
But,
uh,

893
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,670
this pit bull,
just what town?

894
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,310
Pimples or pop.
I mean,

895
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:48,170
they're just amazing animals.
I mean,

896
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,730
they are incredibly strong.
That jaw power is just off the hook.

897
00:41:52,731 --> 00:41:54,590
They're really smart.
So yeah,

898
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:56,480
they're a.
That would be a handful,

899
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,800
especially if it's like 130 pounds.
And Jack,

900
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:04,550
the thing about the pit bull is that 
it's not worried about dying the way of 

901
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:05,420
coyotes.
Coyotes,

902
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:08,690
because no one's feeding them,
their whole thing is like stay alive,

903
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:09,790
survive,
you know,

904
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,650
attack and kill something,
but don't fight to the death.

905
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:17,670
Right.
Whereas a pit bull is essentially bred 

906
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,440
to fight to the death and the ones that 
didn't,

907
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,690
they were removed from the breeding 
population,

908
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,010
like the horrible truth of pit bull 
fighting is like that.

909
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:30,011
Michael Vick story were the ones that 
would quit or the ones that would turn 

910
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:30,110
that wouldn't,
wouldn't engage in the fight.

911
00:42:30,111 --> 00:42:32,570
They would kill them in torture comes 
horrible,

912
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:33,980
horrible,
horrible stuff.

913
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,380
But because of that really nasty,
cruel,

914
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:38,420
vicious way of approaching the dog 
breeding,

915
00:42:38,421 --> 00:42:43,421
what they get is this bloodline of for 
warriors that just have no fear of death

916
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,960
and when you get one,
it's 120 pounds like that.

917
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:49,320
Like fuck man.
Right,

918
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,230
right.
What a giant mistake.

919
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,280
I don't know if it 120 pounds,
I might be making that number up is 

920
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,280
huge.
Huge pit bull.

921
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,690
I think they way they're supposed to run
like 60 pounds I think at the upper end.

922
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,690
So when you start doubling that,
that's a real fighter ones are 35 

923
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:04,690
pounds.
Okay.

924
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,230
And when they fight them,
they're small,

925
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,060
right?
Like when people have this idea of a pit

926
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:10,640
bull in their eyes,
they have this idea of a guard dog,

927
00:43:10,641 --> 00:43:13,370
but it's not really the ones that they 
fight.

928
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,400
They're really not that big,
but their physical muscles aren't that 

929
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,721
big because really it's all about having
the endurance and having the gameness to

930
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:25,160
attack and killed,
pull up this website,

931
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:27,980
land of the giants,
land of the giants pit bulls.

932
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,650
Because like a friend of my senate to me
almost like,

933
00:43:30,651 --> 00:43:35,651
what the fuck is this?
Like they've just figured out a way to 

934
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:35,810
do the same thing that the poultry 
industry has done,

935
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,840
just breed bigger and bigger chickens 
until you have this fried chicken and 

936
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:40,840
can barely walk.
Right.

937
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,100
These guys have done that with pitbulls 
where it's just like,

938
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,040
it looks like they're breeding it with 
something else,

939
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:51,041
but it's really just maybe some Amazon,
the puppy chow or something that would 

940
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:51,980
that work.

941
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,920
I wonder if people have done that,
like,

942
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,440
like inject steroids and guarantee 
somebody's done that.

943
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,610
Yeah,
sure.

944
00:43:58,611 --> 00:43:59,150
Right.
Yeah,

945
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,190
yeah.
Pitbulls,

946
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,860
uh,
have an incredible bite,

947
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:08,890
but what's really crazy is that a wolf 
is a bite that's five times stronger 

948
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:08,890
than a pit bull.
Really?

949
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:09,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

950
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,220
Both has a bite that's,
I think it's 2,500

951
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:15,820
pounds per square inch versus 500 for 
the,

952
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:21,010
for the pit bull.
Look at that thing isn't quite the same 

953
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:23,171
one,
but there's their bigs were giants and 

954
00:44:23,171 --> 00:44:26,270
that size of these things.
That is so ridiculous.

955
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,000
A lot of dog that it's such a ridiculous
dog.

956
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,950
Did you see that land of the giants 
website?

957
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:32,040
Did

958
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,040
you find it?
I typed it in and just like a facebook 

959
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:37,040
page popped up.
Oh really?

960
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,610
I wonder forums asking about them,
but they might've went under.

961
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,130
I don't know.
I don't know.

962
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,680
Who knows?
Yeah,

963
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:45,590
it's really crazy that all these years

964
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:50,610
dogs,
whether it's a Chihuahua or an English 

965
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:50,610
bulldog,
all of them came from wolves.

966
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:55,950
My,
a four year old daughter asked me about 

967
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:55,950
that.
She was like,

968
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,920
dad had were all dogs from wolves and 
I'm like,

969
00:44:56,921 --> 00:44:57,580
yeah.
And she's like,

970
00:44:57,581 --> 00:45:02,581
how does that work?
And like I'm trying to explain genetics 

971
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:03,370
and genetic variability and everything 
and it was uh,

972
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,480
it's um,
if you could explain something to a kid 

973
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:08,480
then you've got a pretty good grasp on 
it.

974
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,840
But I think that she kinda Kinda got the
gist of it.

975
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:15,870
The way I tried to explain it to someone
was that it's kind of like people 

976
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:16,760
because people,
you know,

977
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:19,240
you have like bridge damages and then 
you get Shaquille o'neal,

978
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,560
they're both people,
right.

979
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,410
But one of them obviously is a genetic 
disorder,

980
00:45:23,411 --> 00:45:26,980
but you could sort of breed for that 
genetic disorder.

981
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,970
Right.
And will the guy like Shaquille o'neal,

982
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,230
me and Shaquille o'neal or in the same 
species,

983
00:45:32,231 --> 00:45:33,920
like how's that even possible,
you know,

984
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,220
like they look so different.

985
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,300
Right.
And that sort of like dogs that we by 

986
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,200
preference and breeding and you know,
and I guess geography as well,

987
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,900
that's a huge factor as well.
But.

988
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:47,760
Right.
But it is interesting like that.

989
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,410
The Wolf coyotes,
I guess like Dingoes,

990
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:54,940
like there's a real uniformity there.
Like nature ended up pushing some things

991
00:45:54,941 --> 00:45:58,420
where they've got this kind of Snotty 
Nis and they've got good hearing,

992
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:00,280
a good smell,
but not like a hound dog,

993
00:46:00,281 --> 00:46:01,640
which has better smell,
you know,

994
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:01,940
it's,
it.

995
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:07,080
It's interesting.
And there's also an interesting genetic 

996
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,600
variability in terms of what kind of 
temperature their,

997
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:10,030
their body has to be involved.
Like for,

998
00:46:10,031 --> 00:46:12,160
um,
certain mammals,

999
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,620
when they grow farther north,
they become much,

1000
00:46:14,621 --> 00:46:15,750
much larger,
right?

1001
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:20,940
Like white tailed deer in like Alberta 
can get to around 300 pounds.

1002
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,270
Whereas in Texas they're only like 100 
pounds.

1003
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,370
Maybe 1:50
is like a big deer,

1004
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:28,220
you know,
it's,

1005
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:31,780
it's fascinating that their body just 
decides that,

1006
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:32,600
look,
the way,

1007
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,810
the best way to stay warm is to be 
enormous,

1008
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,120
right?

1009
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,440
It's more round and shorter limbs.
Sure.

1010
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:44,490
Stuff was like polar bears are some of 
the largest bears or Kodiak Alaska 

1011
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,691
bears,
which is sort of a perfect example 

1012
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:49,690
because in Kodiak island,
those brown bears have access to massive

1013
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:54,691
amounts of protein and salmon and 
beached whales and deer and bonds and 

1014
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:57,160
things like that because they're just 
such a genetic.

1015
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Uh,
there's such a genetically powerful 

1016
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,521
creature as is a brown bear,
but then give them all this massive 

1017
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:09,631
amounts of protein and incredible food.
And then on top of that it's freezing 

1018
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:12,871
fucking cold.
So they just become these enormous 

1019
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:12,871
behemoths.
Right,

1020
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:13,180
right.
Yeah.

1021
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:14,470
That's

1022
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:20,990
came out about dinosaurs today.
You were just talking about the 

1023
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:20,990
dinosaurs are real,
bro.

1024
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:20,990
Did you watch that podcast?
It's not about that.

1025
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:21,890
It's a,
that some.

1026
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,480
Sorry,
some scientists did a bunch of research.

1027
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:26,820
He did like three years of research on 
himself or on his own.

1028
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:30,510
He said he went into museums and 
studying the bone fragments and uh,

1029
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,640
he put all of his information into a 
computer program and after five minutes 

1030
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,540
it spit out something that said that,
like all of the,

1031
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:40,630
uh,
are the two major like dinosaur family,

1032
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:45,631
trees are different side of this little 
sun was up here is like what you 

1033
00:47:45,631 --> 00:47:49,921
thought.
I said this is something like telling 

1034
00:47:49,921 --> 00:47:50,650
you that either cats or dogs or what you
thought they were.

1035
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:53,110
And some of the animals you call cats 
are actually dogs.

1036
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,620
This is what I discovered.

1037
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:55,490
Oh,
that is sort of like,

1038
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,630
like,
it's like that.

1039
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:57,580
Oh,
okay.

1040
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:00,160
So for a dummy like me that doesn't know
much about dinosaurs,

1041
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:03,700
theropods to all of them,
the classic tree.

1042
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,870
Interesting.
So what is it,

1043
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:05,790
what are they saying though?
What,

1044
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,550
um,
were there from might be diff,

1045
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,580
like they stopped,
this particular kind came from South 

1046
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:13,580
America before and now it might have 
come from Norway.

1047
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,660
Dinosaurs came from New Orleans.
Yeah.

1048
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:16,810
That's why one of the things that stay 
saying,

1049
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:20,880
so like this is one guy and at this news
hit the waves today.

1050
00:48:20,881 --> 00:48:25,881
It's like making big headlines all over 
about like what does this information 

1051
00:48:25,881 --> 00:48:25,881
mean?
And uh,

1052
00:48:25,881 --> 00:48:27,420
I was just thinking as you guys were 
saying that about wolves,

1053
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:32,421
that like what if they find out next 
week that all doug didn't come from a 

1054
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:33,630
snake bite from cats or some shit like 
that.

1055
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,630
Wow.
Wow.

1056
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:36,770
How strange.

1057
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,680
Yeah,
it's super strange and their diets are a

1058
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,960
little different.
They had some real small ones,

1059
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:45,961
had different kinds of teeth that proved
that they were omnivores and not 

1060
00:48:45,961 --> 00:48:46,870
necessarily like carnivores are 
herbivores or whatever.

1061
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,880
That's a good lesson in like all science
should have a sign hung on it that says 

1062
00:48:53,091 --> 00:48:57,020
good until further notice and you don't 
like turn it into religious doctrine and

1063
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,990
assume that it's 100 percent factual.
You know,

1064
00:48:59,991 --> 00:49:04,970
we create models and hopefully those 
models help us kind of predict and model

1065
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,700
the world.
But you know,

1066
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,390
when you get better,
newer information,

1067
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:09,860
you may have to scuttle that whole 
thing.

1068
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:15,070
Yeah.
There was an article that I tweeted and 

1069
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,661
then a followup article earlier today or
last night rather about a scientific 

1070
00:49:17,331 --> 00:49:22,331
journals about some scandals that are 
emerging from scientific journals or 

1071
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:24,740
scientific journals are essentially 
operating on a pay to play basis.

1072
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,890
Some of them,
they're publishing these things without 

1073
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,390
really vetting the information that's 
inside the papers and ces.

1074
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,130
It just seems like anytime money gets 
involved and stuff,

1075
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:36,260
people become assholes.
Sting,

1076
00:49:36,261 --> 00:49:38,300
operation reveal sciences,
insane.

1077
00:49:38,301 --> 00:49:40,970
Fake news problem.
I love the term fake news,

1078
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,220
right?
Just such an anti intellectual.

1079
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,320
It's so anti intellectual,
you know,

1080
00:49:45,321 --> 00:49:46,460
like fake news.
It's fake.

1081
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:48,410
Like when Donald Trump says that you are
fake news,

1082
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,310
like,
like how are you allow that?

1083
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:55,311
Like there should be a like a list of 
things that would disqualify you from 

1084
00:49:55,311 --> 00:49:58,691
being the president.
Like as soon as you say that you're 

1085
00:49:58,691 --> 00:49:58,691
okay.
Did you say that?

1086
00:49:58,691 --> 00:49:58,691
Yeah.
Okay.

1087
00:49:58,691 --> 00:49:58,880
You got it.
You got to step down,

1088
00:49:58,970 --> 00:49:59,700
right?
Can't.

1089
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,760
You can't call CNN fake news.
Yeah.

1090
00:50:01,761 --> 00:50:03,160
You are fake news.
No,

1091
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:05,870
they are the news.
You might think they're biased.

1092
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:11,050
You make thing that you might be able to
point out some inaccuracies and make 

1093
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,951
them make print a retraction,
but yet calling them fake news like 

1094
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:19,601
that.
Just that term that anyone can use and 

1095
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,890
it's such a small mouth noise to make 
news fake news and you say next.

1096
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,750
Yeah,
next like Whoa,

1097
00:50:23,751 --> 00:50:28,490
buddy settled.
You're fucking with the entire process

1098
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,700
that the district,
because of your own power and the 

1099
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,940
inconvenience of someone telling you 
challenging things,

1100
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:40,180
you're fucking with the entire process 
of getting information to people.

1101
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,200
Right?
Like this.

1102
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:44,750
This last election cycle was really 
interesting.

1103
00:50:44,751 --> 00:50:49,130
Like is it a man?
I don't know.

1104
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,160
Like it would be.
I think kind of cool to be 50 years down

1105
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:54,140
the road and look back at how all this 
plays out.

1106
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:56,270
I don't know that it's going to be great
living through it.

1107
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:01,330
Like I have these thoughts that there's 
going to be like the Great North 

1108
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,340
American States at some point,
whether the,

1109
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:08,390
the s has like five different sub 
countries after some horrific thing goes

1110
00:51:08,601 --> 00:51:13,601
down,
but it people are so entrenched in the 

1111
00:51:13,601 --> 00:51:17,201
radiology and it's just,
it's virtually impossible to get 

1112
00:51:17,201 --> 00:51:17,700
somebody on the opposite side of a 
fence.

1113
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,530
Avid discussion about anything in any 
meeting of the minds.

1114
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:23,630
And uh,
it's interesting to me.

1115
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:28,630
I really think social media is kind of 
facilitated this historical yet like 

1116
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:29,970
print paper for,
you know,

1117
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,020
maybe a couple of hundred years and 
people would have,

1118
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:38,080
you know,
a community gatherings and they would 

1119
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:40,211
talk about different topics.
But that meeting in person and the 

1120
00:51:40,211 --> 00:51:44,470
potential of pissing somebody off and 
having them like try to beat you to 

1121
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,891
death or vice versa.
There is a certain civility that occurs 

1122
00:51:47,891 --> 00:51:51,371
with that.
And within social media you get those 

1123
00:51:51,371 --> 00:51:52,640
same deep held beliefs.
But then you don't have the ramification

1124
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:57,641
of somebody wanting to kick the shit out
of you if you start upping the ante on 

1125
00:51:57,641 --> 00:51:59,130
something.
And so like the,

1126
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,170
the discourse is just crazy,
like there's just no discussion.

1127
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:06,350
There's no middle ground,
there's no understanding in this.

1128
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:11,351
Let's last election cycle was really 
crazy and like it kind of broke me in 

1129
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:11,351
some ways.

1130
00:52:11,351 --> 00:52:11,730
Like I,
I,

1131
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,760
uh,
am way less inclined to invest in much 

1132
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,291
of anything now.
Whereas before I would kind of bleed a 

1133
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:20,970
little bit for some social causes and 
trying to,

1134
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,880
to put some thoughts out about 
something.

1135
00:52:22,881 --> 00:52:25,140
But it was just kinda like,
fuck it,

1136
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:30,230
I just don't care anymore.
Well there are a lot of people that 

1137
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,701
invest tremendous amount of time,
a tremendous amount of time just 

1138
00:52:33,701 --> 00:52:37,600
engaging with people and fighting and 
arguing and insulting and attacking 

1139
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,861
people online.
And I have gone to a bunch of different 

1140
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:43,700
twitter pages where I go,
how many hours is this guy on?

1141
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,460
And then I check to see like when does 
he start his tweets?

1142
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,950
And then there's people that are 
tweeting 12 hours a day.

1143
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,340
Right?
And it's all mean nasty attack shit.

1144
00:52:52,341 --> 00:52:57,341
Like some mentally ill person has a 
computer and nothing is preventing them 

1145
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,540
from just going after people and 
trolling people and attacking people.

1146
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:04,930
What disturbs me is not just that,
but also this natural human tendency 

1147
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:10,391
that we seem to have where you have an 
idea in your head and then that idea is 

1148
00:53:10,391 --> 00:53:14,261
not just an idea,
but it's your idea and you have to 

1149
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:14,261
defend that idea even if it's a 
preposterous idea,

1150
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,370
like the earth is flat.
Right,

1151
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:20,540
and what you find out is that these 
people form groups and other people who 

1152
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,611
have also sort of adopted this 
preposterous idea and refuse to look at 

1153
00:53:24,611 --> 00:53:25,820
all at any evidence at pointed.
That's

1154
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:31,050
a silly idea and instead they dig their 
heels in and get confirmation bias from 

1155
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,691
all these other people.
And then they formed these social media 

1156
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:35,691
groups,
facebook groups.

1157
00:53:35,691 --> 00:53:40,340
They go to websites,
they get on web forums and they start 

1158
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,820
interacting with each other and 
exclusively interacted with each other.

1159
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,920
And then also in forcing each other's 
beliefs and,

1160
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,620
and great job,
man.

1161
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,140
Good job of attacking those shells.
Right?

1162
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:50,550
You know those.
Like if you.

1163
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,410
Do you know if you think the earth is 
round,

1164
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:55,320
you are at globe hard.
That's the newest.

1165
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,620
Jamie literally like cringed each took 
them.

1166
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,440
He had.
I had to like step back.

1167
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,980
Blink his eyes.
Yeah.

1168
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:07,020
You're a globe toward that.
That whole thing is because these 

1169
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,401
people,
someone said something that someone 

1170
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:10,401
went,
well,

1171
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:10,410
people love to find the secrets they 
love.

1172
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:15,411
Like this dinosaur thing is cool because
it seems to be real and you see the gal 

1173
00:54:15,411 --> 00:54:19,221
that said that all the fossils were 
basically people doing like kind of 

1174
00:54:19,221 --> 00:54:23,691
Michelangelo deal and Chiseling the 
matter rock because the fossils came out

1175
00:54:23,821 --> 00:54:24,630
of rock.
Oh you got you.

1176
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,120
And she actually what?
She hasn't pretty nice boobs too.

1177
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:32,370
But yeah,
maybe that's why people are listening,

1178
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,760
but just like,
I've got a platform now you've got tits.

1179
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:39,520
It's really good.
I mean,

1180
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,430
so she's basically like,
okay,

1181
00:54:41,431 --> 00:54:44,700
so these things come out of rocks.
So these anthropologists,

1182
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:49,290
because there's millions of dollars in 
anthropology or archeology there,

1183
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:53,670
just chiseling these bones out of rock 
and here we go to her

1184
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,390
fossils that are found in the ground.
What's that?

1185
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:02,120
You don't want to play games against 
dinosaurs.

1186
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:03,860
I wouldn't need to play some of us.
Okay.

1187
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,210
I'm a little bit about the composition 
composition,

1188
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,300
what they end up being when everything 
is said and done.

1189
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:11,950
So,
uh,

1190
00:55:11,951 --> 00:55:16,951
fossil fossil piece of bone.
So is actually a bone that was once in 

1191
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:27,241
the ground that has been then filled 
with limestone,

1192
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:33,420
calcium and other kinds of stone link 
deposits over the course of many,

1193
00:55:33,971 --> 00:55:37,460
many years left eyes out a patch of the 
day that ends up looking like,

1194
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:42,140
why is she doing that glass?
What's your fucking hair out this big?

1195
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:43,380
And you say,
okay,

1196
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:48,290
there's a bunch of fossils go.
Okay,

1197
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:53,790
can you hand the rock off?
Paleontologist paleontologist takes a 

1198
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:57,001
little malate and they chip away at it 
and at some point they come out with 

1199
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:00,880
something looking like a bomb and this 
is a problem.

1200
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:01,880
Hold on.
This is the problem.

1201
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,670
Just pause that.
The problem is some fucking idiot.

1202
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:08,900
Like this gets to talk about a subject 
that she's not educated in and no one is

1203
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:10,100
over her shoulder.
Got Eh,

1204
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,140
that's not true.
That's not true.

1205
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,240
And here's the thing to people that,
you know,

1206
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:18,770
someone out there who buys into a lot of
the stupid shit,

1207
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,290
you must be an expert in something,
you know,

1208
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:22,980
think about what you do for a living.
You know,

1209
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:24,040
like this.
Here's

1210
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,040
a perfect example.
Like some of someone tried to tell me 

1211
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:29,140
that,
like,

1212
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:33,100
a lot of these cheat touch martial arts 
guys are two deadly to fight in the UFC.

1213
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:37,180
And if they make a video,
they make a video about this and I'm not

1214
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:42,181
there while they're making this video.
So I can't talk to them like in stop 

1215
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:43,090
them and pause them and go,
nope,

1216
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:43,990
that's not true.
Nope,

1217
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,620
that's not.
Nope,

1218
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,550
that's not correct.
No,

1219
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:50,580
no.
Here's actually what happens when you 

1220
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:50,580
get knocked out.
No,

1221
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,510
it is not a fucking cheat discretion or 
dispersion technique.

1222
00:56:52,511 --> 00:56:55,590
You're not really interrupting the 
shockers flow.

1223
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,950
No,
it's a fucking concussion.

1224
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:58,600
Stupid.
And we can measure concussions.

1225
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:01,360
We know about all the different 
variables in the blood.

1226
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:06,361
When you could prove it was actually.
There's some new tests that I wanted to 

1227
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:06,361
get into as well.
Um,

1228
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:06,970
where they,
um,

1229
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,200
there's an institute now that's checking
concussions and they're checking,

1230
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,650
they're doing blood tests on people to 
find out about concussions that they've 

1231
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,490
had in the past and how those 
concussions have healed.

1232
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:24,570
Obviously I'm deviating from the path,
but the point is I know a lot about 

1233
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:28,411
martial arts,
so if someone wants to do a video about 

1234
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:31,531
martial arts while I'm an actual martial
arts expert and I can talk to you about 

1235
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:31,810
what you're saying,
that's incorrect.

1236
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,980
I know about the history of it.
I know what,

1237
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:37,750
what works and why it works.
I know about Torque and leverage and all

1238
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:42,751
these different variables,
but you could make a video with without 

1239
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:46,921
me being there and you could ramble on 
or not even me in any martial arts 

1240
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,640
expert and you could ramble on and if 
someone doesn't know,

1241
00:57:48,641 --> 00:57:50,320
they watched and they go,
wow,

1242
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,450
that guy dropping some truth bombs.
Right?

1243
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,310
This is amazing.
You know,

1244
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,230
I don't know if you saw this,
but Matt Thornton,

1245
00:57:56,231 --> 00:57:59,110
he's the founder,
really brilliant guy,

1246
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:03,550
and they put together this.
I forget who it was.

1247
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,580
It's kind of a philosophy department and
they put together this kind of white 

1248
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,851
sheet on using Brazilian Jujitsu in 
particular as a means of teaching 

1249
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:16,621
critical thinking to students because 
there's this really testable,

1250
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:21,100
verifiable process.
Does it work or does it not work?

1251
00:58:21,101 --> 00:58:24,370
And you can define what working means 
versus this kind of like,

1252
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:24,990
you know,
cheat,

1253
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:30,000
didn't lock death touch type type stuff.
And so they've actually developed this 

1254
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,860
curriculum around using this physical 
process of Brazilian Jujitsu and I think

1255
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:37,861
also mixed martial arts in general,
but specifically Jujitsu as a means of 

1256
00:58:37,861 --> 00:58:40,000
teaching critical thinking skills and 
said,

1257
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:46,140
I'll,
I'll noodle on what like Kinda like the 

1258
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,110
search terms for would be.
But it's really interesting and it,

1259
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:52,120
it's um,
it's something that I think helps pull 

1260
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,710
this stuff together because you've got 
that kinesthetic element of people being

1261
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:55,060
able to feel,
okay,

1262
00:58:55,061 --> 00:58:56,380
you know,
somebody gets mounted onto you,

1263
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:57,460
can you get them off?
No,

1264
00:58:57,461 --> 00:58:59,620
we'll look at this 100,
10 pound chick.

1265
00:58:59,621 --> 00:59:04,621
She can dismount this person conditions 
using these techniques of leverage and 

1266
00:59:04,621 --> 00:59:08,491
balance and timing and all that stuff.
And so then you can throw these things 

1267
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:11,110
out about is this a verifiable process,
yes or no?

1268
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:16,111
And it is.
And so then you start laying the 

1269
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:17,860
foundation of being able to create a 
good critical thinking process.

1270
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:21,980
One of the things that I really love 
about Brazilian Jujitsu in particular is

1271
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,490
that it seems to be a study in variable 
absolutes,

1272
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
meaning that there's so many variables 
involved in like two people engaging 

1273
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:33,920
with each other.
Say if two people are blue belts and the

1274
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:38,921
engage with each other and one person 
dominates that person with superior 

1275
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:40,940
technique and knowledge and gets the tap
over and over again.

1276
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:46,270
You could take that same person who 
dominated that person and then put him 

1277
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:50,471
in there with a guy leg Jacques Ra and 
he would just get manhandled and it 

1278
00:59:50,471 --> 00:59:55,211
would look like he knows virtually 
nothing about Jujitsu because some one 

1279
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:59,450
person's the variables,
the understanding of all the 

1280
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:03,311
complexities of the techniques they have
mastered them and they have also built 

1281
01:00:03,311 --> 01:00:06,650
their body to a much stronger physical 
unit.

1282
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,310
So all these are variables,
but the absolute is getting the arm bar,

1283
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:12,740
getting the choke,
putting someone to sleep with a choke,

1284
01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:14,050
like those things are absolute.

1285
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:19,050
It's like where you tap out if you're 
not just like a person who gets scared 

1286
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:22,310
really quick and taps out for no reason 
which does happen,

1287
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:24,080
but you're thinking about someone who 
has some experience.

1288
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,000
When you're tapping out,
you're essentially saying,

1289
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,790
you've got me into this absolute 
position.

1290
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:29,440
I'm,
I'm,

1291
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,600
I'm at the point of death or massive 
injury.

1292
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:34,940
Knees tearing apart,
arms breaking.

1293
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:40,420
So in doing those,
you encounter these variable absolutes 

1294
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:43,940
in a way that is really kind of uncommon
in our world,

1295
01:00:43,941 --> 01:00:46,940
outside of fucking car accidents and 
someone hitting you over the head with a

1296
01:00:46,941 --> 01:00:48,490
baseball bat and you,
you,

1297
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:53,580
you will encounter the consequences of 
actions and movements in a way that sort

1298
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:59,021
of makes you really appreciate the 
overall variables of life and how 

1299
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:01,310
important it is to take care of your 
health.

1300
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:03,920
How important it is to know what you're 
talking about.

1301
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,550
You know,
if,

1302
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:09,690
if fighting.
I was trying to talk about fighting is 

1303
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:10,700
if it's a language and if one person has
like one word,

1304
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:13,040
they yell at you and they're like really
good at going,

1305
01:01:13,041 --> 01:01:16,250
shut the fuck up.
Like one expression like that might work

1306
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:21,251
with some people.
It's not gonna work with someone who's 

1307
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:21,251
got a really good grasp of the English 
language.

1308
01:01:21,251 --> 01:01:21,740
Oh I should shut the fuck up and wash 
it.

1309
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:23,210
I shut the fuck up because you would 
like that.

1310
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:28,420
Why would you like that?
Because you're too stupid to have a 

1311
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:30,011
conversation about something you don't 
know you're talking about and that 

1312
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:30,011
person's like,
oh,

1313
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:33,210
it's really like drowning in which is 
the same way you'd feel of Damien Maia 

1314
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:35,120
was on top of you trying to choke you.
It's a lot like a language,

1315
01:01:35,121 --> 01:01:40,121
like you don't have enough variables to 
respond to this particular thing and 

1316
01:01:40,121 --> 01:01:41,360
then there's also the strength factor 
and those other factors.

1317
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:46,660
I think it teaches you critical thinking
in a way that is almost unavailable 

1318
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:51,890
outside of like war and like real 
physical trauma.

1319
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:55,820
Because the beautiful thing about 
Jujitsu is although you can get injured,

1320
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:58,700
most of it is pretty safe,
right?

1321
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,410
Compared to boxing or kickboxing.
Yeah.

1322
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:04,550
You've got a much more forgivable kind 
of margin of error on that.

1323
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,580
Yeah.
Much more and I think the environment 

1324
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:12,431
that it establishes,
that it creates and the way that effect 

1325
01:02:12,431 --> 01:02:16,211
that it has on your mind,
what's forcing you into these extreme 

1326
01:02:16,211 --> 01:02:17,570
problems,
situations and solving those problems.

1327
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:22,571
Then understanding where that go wrong,
what can I do to my body to maybe 

1328
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:27,291
strengthen myself so that I can stop 
that from happening or maybe understand 

1329
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,670
the position.
So two steps ahead.

1330
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:32,970
I recognize that if I go left,
I run into that and if I go right,

1331
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:35,220
I run into this,
what I need to do is be patient,

1332
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,750
use my hips,
hip escape,

1333
01:02:36,751 --> 01:02:37,530
do this,
do that.

1334
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:42,860
And those,
those variables and understanding those 

1335
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,741
variables and having that,
that database in your mind and 

1336
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:47,050
recognizing that that is also,
that's there's,

1337
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:52,070
there's analogies that you could make in
all sorts of avenues in life that were,

1338
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:55,020
that would be greatly beneficial.
Well,

1339
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,350
it and again,
uh,

1340
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,400
just another hat tip to Matt Thornton,
like he's just made this point that 

1341
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:01,400
these,
um,

1342
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,560
uh,
alive art,

1343
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,060
whether it's wrestling or boxing or Thai
boxing,

1344
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:07,500
Jujitsu,
judo,

1345
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,920
um,
there's kind of an authenticity with 

1346
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,730
that because you really can't bullshit.
It's kind of like,

1347
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:15,300
can you speak Spanish?
Okay,

1348
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:20,301
well let's have a conversation in 
Spanish reading Spanish newspaper and 

1349
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:21,270
tell me what was going on with it.
Can you swim?

1350
01:03:21,271 --> 01:03:22,230
You know,
Sam Harris,

1351
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,540
I think he wrote that piece,
you know,

1352
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:28,260
Jujitsu was like drowning for a non,
for a non swimmer,

1353
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:33,261
looking at someone treading water,
it looks inconsequential and you throw 

1354
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:33,261
them in the water and they're going to 
die.

1355
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:38,050
And so there's a real authenticity there
that when you get in and do that 

1356
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:42,770
compared to some of the fantasy martial 
arts where there is an assumption that 

1357
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:47,451
just going through some sort of paces is
going to get you somewhere and it 

1358
01:03:47,451 --> 01:03:47,451
doesn't necessarily mean that it does,
you know?

1359
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:52,490
And so there's this whole great feedback
loop and it crushes your ego and you 

1360
01:03:53,221 --> 01:03:56,760
have to really stay grounded if you're 
gonna maintain through that process,

1361
01:03:56,761 --> 01:04:00,780
but it has so much value with every 
other facet of your life.

1362
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:01,890
You know,
it's fascinating.

1363
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:03,690
Yeah.
If you can keep from being injured,

1364
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:04,590
if you.
Yeah.

1365
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:09,680
Yeah.
And I think one of the things that 

1366
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,331
really helped to keep from being injured
is I think it's very critical to 

1367
01:04:11,331 --> 01:04:14,871
strengthen the body and I think there's 
a lot of people that don't like to do 

1368
01:04:14,871 --> 01:04:14,871
that.
They just like to train.

1369
01:04:14,871 --> 01:04:19,730
And I was guilty of that for quite a 
while until I just mounted up a series 

1370
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:20,430
of injuries that I almost couldn't deny 
it anymore,

1371
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,380
uh,
particularly back injuries,

1372
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:27,710
but strengthening the body and sort of 
strengthening the overall structure in 

1373
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,060
which you engage in these sorts of 
things.

1374
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:35,270
Meaning not just strengthening the body 
will by lifting weights and doing 

1375
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:38,241
squats,
but also by yoga also by doing really 

1376
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,190
unusual exercise like kettlebell 
windmills and stuff like that.

1377
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:45,570
That really puts a very bizarre load on 
the spine and weird ways.

1378
01:04:45,571 --> 01:04:50,571
And it's really strengthens the core in 
a substantial manner that allows you to 

1379
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:54,630
deal with the pressure of certain 
positions without succumbing to the,

1380
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:55,350
you know,
the,

1381
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,480
the,
the attempt by your opponent.

1382
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:58,260
Right.
You know,

1383
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:03,261
it's a,
it's an interesting topic because you 

1384
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:03,261
have someone like Marcello Garcia that 
he's like,

1385
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:06,430
I just roll and clearly that word is 
injured now.

1386
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,210
He's,
he's definitely,

1387
01:05:09,211 --> 01:05:10,560
you can just roll,
right?

1388
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,570
You definitely can do it.
And if you're as until you can't.

1389
01:05:12,571 --> 01:05:14,220
Yeah.
It's technical as him.

1390
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,800
He also has weird genetics.
Like if you look at Marcello's body,

1391
01:05:17,801 --> 01:05:20,230
his legs look like a man who weighs 300 
pounds.

1392
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:22,660
I mean he has cankles slack.
Yeah.

1393
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,970
Yeah.
Shannon cafs giant legs.

1394
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:29,971
And that's one of the reasons why he's 
so good at controlling the back is he's 

1395
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:31,570
using his legs and smashing you.
Huge legs.

1396
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:36,630
Well let me ask you about that.
Like I've been a big fan again of kind 

1397
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:37,520
of this straight blast gym stuff of you 
know,

1398
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:41,500
like non attribute based training,
like how do you break that up?

1399
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:44,230
So like if you were flexible,
are your explosive or,

1400
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:49,231
or what have you.
How much of that do you rely on versus 

1401
01:05:49,231 --> 01:05:51,550
trying to develop this stuff where 
you've got a game that you could do,

1402
01:05:51,551 --> 01:05:53,830
whether you're 40 years old or 80 years 
old,

1403
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:56,680
like how do you play back and forth with
that to to,

1404
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:58,190
you know,
optimize that process?

1405
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:02,140
A real good question,
and I think a good study is Roy Jones Jr

1406
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:07,470
and Roy Jones Jr in his prime was 
probably the most attribute based 

1407
01:06:07,470 --> 01:06:10,360
fighter of all time with substantial 
attributes.

1408
01:06:10,361 --> 01:06:15,361
His speed and his style though the 
movement in which he used inside the 

1409
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:18,280
ring was really very difficult for 
people to handle,

1410
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:23,350
but as soon as that went away,
his physical attributes sorta started to

1411
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:27,130
deteriorate.
His career declined substantially.

1412
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:29,420
He went from being the best in the 
world.

1413
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:34,490
Two years later,
people wanted him to retire and he went 

1414
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,030
from and there's a bunch of variables 
that could have happened in that fact.

1415
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:40,770
I think some manipulation of hormones we
know,

1416
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:45,780
I'm just speculating,
but I believe steroids are probably 

1417
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,030
involved in him moving up from light 
heavyweight to heavyweight or a beat 

1418
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:51,991
John Ruiz for the heavyweight title and 
was jacked at 200 pounds shredded and 

1419
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:57,870
then went down and fought Antonio Tarver
and looked listless and soft and didn't 

1420
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:03,001
look as fast and I think a lot of that 
was his body responding to the fact that

1421
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:05,290
he,
his hormone levels were off.

1422
01:07:05,290 --> 01:07:07,030
And I don't know if he was checking that
stuff,

1423
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:12,031
but I bet he probably wasn't.
I bet he just had lost too much weight 

1424
01:07:12,031 --> 01:07:15,811
and dehydrated himself too much.
Getting down to that 175 pound limit 

1425
01:07:15,811 --> 01:07:16,840
again.
So tarver knocked him out and then Glenn

1426
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,760
Johnson knocked him out after the fight 
and it was bad.

1427
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:20,440
Right.
I think that,

1428
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:22,840
um,
when Roy was in his prime though,

1429
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:27,310
he did some things that were so hard to 
handle,

1430
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:29,830
so unconventional because of his 
ridiculous speed.

1431
01:07:29,831 --> 01:07:32,980
Like very rarely did he throw the jab 
instead,

1432
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:37,120
he would throw a lead hook and we throw 
a lead hook and it was as fast as a jab,

1433
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,180
but it would knock people to fuck out,
right?

1434
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,060
You know,
he would just,

1435
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:45,180
he would just,
just good leap in on your plot and you 

1436
01:07:45,180 --> 01:07:45,730
see guys get hit and then boom,
the right hand would be behind it.

1437
01:07:46,030 --> 01:07:49,480
He was so fucking fast.
So when he was young,

1438
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,640
he beat Bernard Hopkins and he beat him 
pretty handily when he was older.

1439
01:07:54,641 --> 01:07:57,880
Bernard Hopkins beat him,
beat him pretty handily,

1440
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,730
and Bernard Hopkins was always older 
than him.

1441
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:06,030
So when he was young,
Bernard Hopkins who had that very 

1442
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,020
defensive based style,
keeps his hands up very high,

1443
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:13,021
very technical,
couldn't deal with the speed of Roy 

1444
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:13,021
Jones Jr.
He just was ridiculous.

1445
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,800
But as soon as roy lost a step and it's 
speed,

1446
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,620
tHen his style's not really the best 
style.

1447
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:22,130
The best style is the most technical 
style.

1448
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:27,440
And you can do that most technical style
with extreme attributes,

1449
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,140
right?
So I would agree with them that the best

1450
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:35,141
thing to learn is the proper way of 
learning all the techniques like 

1451
01:08:35,141 --> 01:08:36,320
learning good defensive posture,
good,

1452
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,960
good,
hands up when you're throwing strikes,

1453
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:43,160
good movement and footwork and not just 
relying on freak athleticism.

1454
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,310
Think it's probably the best way to 
attack it.

1455
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,770
What do you think about the really grip 
dependent games?

1456
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:51,170
You know like all the,
the spider guard and all that stuff.

1457
01:08:51,171 --> 01:08:56,171
Like I see these guys doing really 
amazing stuff but it seems like their 

1458
01:08:56,171 --> 01:08:59,771
hands are broken and it pretty young age
and I mean maybe that's something that 

1459
01:08:59,871 --> 01:09:04,871
you burn just to because you've got a 
competitive career and then you've got 

1460
01:09:04,871 --> 01:09:06,530
to kind of shift games.
But then you have someone like crohn who

1461
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:08,690
really.
He has an interesting,

1462
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:13,691
you know,
open guard game where it's a lot of 

1463
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,491
color control and stuff like that and 
he's not getting in and doing like 

1464
01:09:15,491 --> 01:09:18,941
spider garden inversions and whatnot.
And you could argue is mayBe not as 

1465
01:09:18,941 --> 01:09:20,600
successful as a lot of other people in 
that.

1466
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:25,710
That really competitive circuit.
But he also seems to be motoring along 

1467
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:25,710
pretty well.

1468
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,190
Reasonably injuRy free and still has a 
very powerful game.

1469
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,640
Well he is an incredibly powerful game.
You also have to think,

1470
01:09:31,641 --> 01:09:33,970
well his dad is the greatest jujitsu 
player time,

1471
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:38,990
so that had to play a factor,
although it didn't really train much 

1472
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:39,080
with his dad,
which is kind of unusual.

1473
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,980
Um,
he doesn't have the,

1474
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,770
he doesn't his dad.
And when I say the basics,

1475
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:48,350
what I mean the basics,
I don't mean like it's a simple game.

1476
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:53,351
His game very complex,
but he doesn't do any weird sorta della 

1477
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:59,530
hiva stuff or weird spider guard stuff.
Like his game is basically the same kind

1478
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:03,650
of jujitsu used to see in 1994 when 
hickson was the king.

1479
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:09,130
But it's not it.
It's just super tuned in and high level 

1480
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:13,841
and razor sharp like his.
One of his best submissions is the good 

1481
01:10:13,841 --> 01:10:15,020
team has another best submissions,
a rear naked choke.

1482
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,930
And if he gets you in those positions,
you're foxville right.

1483
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:22,950
You know,
and it's really just that his technique 

1484
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:25,661
is so fucking sharp and it's,
there's levels to that sharpness of 

1485
01:10:25,661 --> 01:10:25,661
technique.
you know,

1486
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:30,080
there's some guys that just have a 
technique that is so god damn sharp,

1487
01:10:30,081 --> 01:10:33,200
it's impossible to avoid like on a level
lower level,

1488
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:38,201
but there was a guy named paul sas used 
to compete in the ufc who's to fucking 

1489
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:41,891
triangle everybody.
He wants something like nine or 10 

1490
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:41,891
matches by triangles.
Ridiculous.

1491
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:44,510
He just would pull guard and then you'd 
be fucked.

1492
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,960
He would just figure out a way to wrap 
your neck and arm around his legs,

1493
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:53,140
squeeze the shit out of it.
And next thing you know you're tapping 

1494
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:53,140
or blacked out.
Right?

1495
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:56,560
And people knew what he would do.
They knew that that was his game and 

1496
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:56,560
they would still get caught in a 
triangle.

1497
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,650
It's like,
what the fuck?

1498
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:02,710
Right?
It's because his technique was so razor 

1499
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:03,020
sharp.
So I,

1500
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:08,170
I think there's a lot of people that get
caught up in those grabbing a games,

1501
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:10,850
those grip dependent games and maybe 
they,

1502
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,690
you know,
they would go,

1503
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:13,320
well let me try it on you.
I'll fuck you up wiTh it.

1504
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,880
And they,
maybe they would fuck me up with it.

1505
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:20,150
But I honestly believed that the best 
jujitsu is jujitsu that you can do with 

1506
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,780
ge or without a [inaudible].
And a lot of those guys where they get 

1507
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,510
into mma,
they don't have any handles to grab,

1508
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:32,800
right?
So nogi jujitsu is much more like greco 

1509
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,321
roman wrestling,
whereas eddie bravo and his 10th planet 

1510
01:11:36,321 --> 01:11:39,801
jiu jitsu system,
when he's done a sort of incorporate 

1511
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:39,801
much more,
no,

1512
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:43,230
uh,
like greco roman control.

1513
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:44,720
And you can do that.
Like when I,

1514
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:47,430
I still roll with the gang,
but when I do [inaudible] jujitsu,

1515
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:49,220
I very rarely grabbed the gay.

1516
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,990
Right.
Everything I'm doing is like under hooks

1517
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:57,050
over hooks.
I'm getting gAble grips and I'm using 

1518
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,710
nogi techniques with agi.
So for me,

1519
01:11:58,711 --> 01:12:02,130
what I like about the ge is defensively 
I can't fuck around,

1520
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:07,230
right?
Like I can't just yank out of arm bars 

1521
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,351
and shit.
Like if you're in there with a good guy 

1522
01:12:09,351 --> 01:12:11,151
and he's got you in his garden is a key.
There's so much friction that you have 

1523
01:12:11,151 --> 01:12:14,721
to really be careful.
But I think offensively you have to be 

1524
01:12:14,721 --> 01:12:15,460
very careful to not use that key.
Right.

1525
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,350
But the good thing about learning how to
use the g,

1526
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:24,351
it's like say if you get in a fight with
someone and they have a winter coat on 

1527
01:12:24,351 --> 01:12:24,351
their fucking dead,
right?

1528
01:12:24,351 --> 01:12:24,840
You know,
some guy wants some drunk,

1529
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,380
wants to kick your ass and you just get 
your hand inside his collar and like,

1530
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,190
oh,
look at you,

1531
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:30,560
you're a dead man,
you know,

1532
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:31,090
you're dead.

1533
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,680
Like if you get a guy who's like got a 
good ezekiel choke or something like 

1534
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:36,680
that and he gets a hold of you and he's 
on top of you.

1535
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,970
And he gets his,
his own color and wraps around,

1536
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:41,300
chokes you to death with his own arms.
You know,

1537
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:41,700
it's,
uh,

1538
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,160
that's good stuff.
Yeah.

1539
01:12:43,161 --> 01:12:44,850
There's,
there's like judo player,

1540
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:48,420
like if someone like jimmy pedro gets a 
hold of your leather jacket,

1541
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:53,450
you're fucked man.
He's gonna hit you with the world 

1542
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:57,560
essentially.
Like when someone's throwing you in the 

1543
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:57,560
ground,
like a real world class,

1544
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,520
judoka hitting you in the head with the 
world,

1545
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,800
they're going to throw you on your head,
you're going to go unconscious.

1546
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:03,760
Right?
Have you guys had henry akin on?

1547
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:04,740
No,
I haven't.

1548
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,010
Henry's amazing.
Yeah.

1549
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:08,460
Such a good guy.
He's a black belt under hixon as well.

1550
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,840
Yeah,
I know henry very well.

1551
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:10,500
Yeah.
Yeah.

1552
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:11,330
He's,
you know,

1553
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:12,930
hickson's black belts.
There's,

1554
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:14,610
there's certain,
there's like a.

1555
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:16,560
There's a few black belts like,
whoa.

1556
01:13:16,561 --> 01:13:19,200
You've got a henzel gracie black belt.
That's fucking legit.

1557
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:24,230
Right.
There's a few of those like that in 

1558
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:24,230
hixson is one of the most legitimate 
those.

1559
01:13:24,230 --> 01:13:25,210
Yeah.
Henry is just a great guy in his game is

1560
01:13:25,211 --> 01:13:30,211
really interesting.
Like the g and the nogi game are 

1561
01:13:30,211 --> 01:13:32,401
virtually identical.
I mean you do a little stuff for the 

1562
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:33,360
color jokes and whatnot,
but otherwise it's,

1563
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,380
it's just completely uniform from geeta 
nogi and so it's,

1564
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:42,381
it's interesting for me to being 45 and 
trying to motor through this stuff and 

1565
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:46,981
I'm really not that bright of a person.
It's like I need transferable job 

1566
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:49,921
skills.
Like I want to learn something once and 

1567
01:13:49,921 --> 01:13:51,460
not need a million nuances for things.
A dummies right now or listening to this

1568
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:52,330
going,
you're not bright.

1569
01:13:52,331 --> 01:13:55,060
What am I fucking champ?
Shit.

1570
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,040
He's not brIght.
Fuck.

1571
01:13:57,280 --> 01:13:59,740
Could be.
Could be now a,

1572
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,220
what are you doing to regulate your 
hormones or check your hormones?

1573
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,340
I checked them about yearly and uh,
you know,

1574
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:10,180
the main deal with that is just keeping 
a really good eye on my sleep,

1575
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:11,830
my nutrition recovery.

1576
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,480
I do some hrv monitoring and the heart 
rate variability,

1577
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,980
so you check that in the morning and 
basically hrv was studied,

1578
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:24,400
developed,
discovered by the eastern bloc countries

1579
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:29,460
and it was part of the space program and
it's looking at the total alice static 

1580
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,360
load or the stress load on an 
individual.

1581
01:14:31,361 --> 01:14:34,960
So the heart,
if you have 60 beats a minute,

1582
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:38,110
it doesn't necessarily mean that it's 
beating once a second.

1583
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:43,530
You may have three beats that go really 
fast and then there may be a long pause 

1584
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:45,640
and then two beats and so there's 
variability to.

1585
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:49,270
And it's basically chaos mathematics 
that describes this stuff,

1586
01:14:49,271 --> 01:14:52,600
but if you are not under significant 
stress,

1587
01:14:52,601 --> 01:14:57,601
if your parasympathetic nervous system,
the rest and restore part is kind of 

1588
01:14:57,601 --> 01:15:00,070
brought to the fore like breathing,
meditation,

1589
01:15:00,071 --> 01:15:01,330
yoga,
that sort of stuff.

1590
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:05,050
Then you tended to have more heart rate 
variability and that's a good thing.

1591
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:10,440
when you get under stress,
then you tend to have less heart rate 

1592
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:13,771
variability and becomes more metronomic,
so I've found that if I keep an eye on 

1593
01:15:13,771 --> 01:15:18,151
my heart rate variability in conjunction
with my food and my sleep and all the 

1594
01:15:18,151 --> 01:15:20,950
rest of that stuff than the hormones 
tend to stay pretty good in line,

1595
01:15:20,951 --> 01:15:25,810
but if they start pushing anything,
if I start compromising sleep for me,

1596
01:15:25,811 --> 01:15:30,811
if I go to low carb too long,
particularly with some really hard 

1597
01:15:30,811 --> 01:15:34,141
training,
then I will kind of get adrenalized and 

1598
01:15:34,141 --> 01:15:37,130
I get all the signs and symptoms of 
testosterone kind of dropping down and 

1599
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:41,070
whatnot.
Which is interesting because I know 

1600
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:43,081
you've played around with that and 
seemed out some pretty good success in 

1601
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:43,081
quito.
Fueled rolling.

1602
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:43,290
Yeah.
Well,

1603
01:15:43,291 --> 01:15:48,291
what I had was.
What fascinated me is I'm on 

1604
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:51,321
testosterone replacement therapy and 
when I took my diet away from a high 

1605
01:15:52,921 --> 01:15:56,910
carbohydrate diet to a much more high 
fat diet,

1606
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:00,510
ketogenic diet,
my testosterone levels were way up.

1607
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:05,750
Interesting way up and not just me,
but a bunch of my friends who were also 

1608
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:10,041
on testosterone replacement therapy 
reported the same thing where they said 

1609
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:10,410
like,
my friend john is stuffed,

1610
01:16:10,411 --> 01:16:11,940
doubled his,
his,

1611
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:15,810
his levels doubled and he couldn't find 
any other variability.

1612
01:16:15,811 --> 01:16:18,660
And it was the thing.
Was that just free testosterone or fleet

1613
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:21,040
in total question?
Um,

1614
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,620
I believe it was free.
Okay.

1615
01:16:22,650 --> 01:16:24,810
But what it,
what it is apparently is,

1616
01:16:24,811 --> 01:16:29,811
and please correct me if I'm wrong,
the precursors for testosterone are the 

1617
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,960
saturated fats and cholesterol in your 
body produces testosterone from them,

1618
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:40,490
right?
When you have an abundance of them and 

1619
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:40,490
you're in a healthy balance like you're 
about,

1620
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:43,530
it's not like you're consuming a 
unhealthy foods.

1621
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:48,890
When you get a healthy balance of those,
your body produces more testosterone 

1622
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:48,900
naturally.

1623
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,020
Okay?
Okay.

1624
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:55,290
Well,
and it's interesting and this is where 

1625
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:57,121
this stuff gets really complex,
but usually when people are on a lower 

1626
01:16:57,121 --> 01:17:01,261
carb diet and this hormone called sex 
hormone binding protein or sex hormone 

1627
01:17:01,261 --> 01:17:02,980
binding globulin,
that increases and what that can do,

1628
01:17:02,981 --> 01:17:06,340
it can reduce the level of free 
testosterone.

1629
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:08,470
So your total testosterone may look 
good,

1630
01:17:08,471 --> 01:17:12,410
the free testosterone may look great.
That's a not an uncommon thing to happen

1631
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:16,010
on low carb diets.
But then the interesting side to that is

1632
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:21,011
that the receptor sites,
which are really what matters in this 

1633
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:24,791
whole story,
the receptor site density for 

1634
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:28,181
testosterone increases so you may not 
need as much to get the same effect that

1635
01:17:29,330 --> 01:17:34,330
you would otherwise have or if you have 
a little bit more testosterone than 

1636
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:34,330
you're going to get an even greater 
effect.

1637
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:39,101
And so that receptor site density,
like what is causing that I don't fully 

1638
01:17:41,091 --> 01:17:41,630
know.

1639
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:46,800
Um,
but when people are on a lower carb 

1640
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,241
diet,
it does appear that anabolic hormones 

1641
01:17:49,241 --> 01:17:49,460
have a more pronounced effect and what 
they would have during a,

1642
01:17:49,550 --> 01:17:54,550
a higher carb period.
And I don't really know the mechanism 

1643
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,180
behind how that works,
but it definitely,

1644
01:17:56,181 --> 01:17:57,290
you seem to get,
you know,

1645
01:17:57,291 --> 01:18:02,291
if you have 100 units of testosterone or
estrogen in one person and they have a 

1646
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:06,480
certain number of a receptor sites and 
then another person,

1647
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:11,481
same hormonal level but more receptor 
sites than they are going to get them 

1648
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:12,860
more potent.
Anabolic response out,

1649
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,950
yeah,
so many variables and then when you take

1650
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:20,951
into account what we've discussed 
already about genetic variables and the 

1651
01:18:20,951 --> 01:18:23,801
right bit,
different people respond differently to 

1652
01:18:23,801 --> 01:18:23,801
that

1653
01:18:23,801 --> 01:18:25,760
hydrates and fats and proteins.
It is so difficult for people to find 

1654
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,540
the thing that works best for them.
Right?

1655
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:32,710
Right.
For me it seems like quito or maybe a 

1656
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:33,750
little bit more carbs and quito is the 
way to go.

1657
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:34,660
Right.
You know,

1658
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:39,770
but what I do is one of the big things 
to do is have any of it laying right 

1659
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:40,920
here.
I supplement with exoticness ketones.

1660
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:41,500
Okay.
Yeah,

1661
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:43,380
and that seems to have a big effect on 
me.

1662
01:18:43,381 --> 01:18:48,381
It,
it definitely puts me into a state of 

1663
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:48,381
ketosis.
I use something called key genics,

1664
01:18:48,381 --> 01:18:49,440
but I believe there's some other stuff 
on the on the market,

1665
01:18:49,441 --> 01:18:53,700
but dom d'agostino,
who is a professor and what is it?

1666
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:57,480
University of Florida,
and he is one of the foremost experts on

1667
01:18:57,481 --> 01:18:59,010
kido and he's coming on the podcast 
soon.

1668
01:18:59,011 --> 01:19:02,490
We're working on finding a date,
but in the meantime,

1669
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:04,410
his interview with tim ferriss is 
amazing.

1670
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:07,890
I think he's done twice a,
maybe more on tim show,

1671
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:13,250
but that when he discusses it,
you kind of understand like what the 

1672
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,290
benefits of being on this high fat diet 
are,

1673
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:20,690
and then you also realize what,
what the compromise is that your body 

1674
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:22,860
has to make when you change it to a high
carbohydrate,

1675
01:19:22,861 --> 01:19:27,861
high sugar diet.
And one of the things that is a new 

1676
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:31,611
study that dr rhonda,
rhonda patrick sent me recently was the 

1677
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:36,501
dangers of saturated fats have been sort
of overstated a lot of it because of 

1678
01:19:38,311 --> 01:19:43,311
that.
I'm sure you're aware that New York 

1679
01:19:43,311 --> 01:19:44,961
times article about the sugar industry,
literally bing scientists lie in the 19 

1680
01:19:45,631 --> 01:19:50,631
fifties and say that heart disease is 
being called caused by saturated fats 

1681
01:19:50,631 --> 01:19:51,640
and taking the blame off of sugar.
Right?

1682
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:57,080
And they altered data and really fucked 
with generations of people's ideas to 

1683
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:01,020
change the information that we receive 
and fuck with people's heads.

1684
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:03,180
But there was a recent study that showed
that,

1685
01:20:03,860 --> 01:20:08,860
um,
process sugar mixed with saturated is 

1686
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:08,860
actually

1687
01:20:08,860 --> 01:20:13,400
not healthy at all and it actually 
perhaps could be more unhealthy than 

1688
01:20:14,611 --> 01:20:16,020
processed sugar alone.
Right?

1689
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,720
And it,
it really makes sense because if we over

1690
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:21,620
consume carbohydrates in general than 
we,

1691
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:26,670
we fill up the liver,
glycogen in the liver starts converting 

1692
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:27,840
this into palmitic acid,
which is a saturated fat.

1693
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:33,230
And that paul medic acid tends to make 
us insulin resistant and indeed good 

1694
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:37,821
mechanisms behind that,
like there's good kind of engineering 

1695
01:20:37,821 --> 01:20:40,260
there if we're eating a little bit more 
of an ancestral type diet,

1696
01:20:40,261 --> 01:20:45,261
but when you throw a modern process diet
and sedentism and messed up circadian 

1697
01:20:47,011 --> 01:20:47,580
rhythm,
you know,

1698
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:49,410
not going to bed on time,
not getting enough,

1699
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:53,550
a daylight sun,
then the whole mess ends up being really

1700
01:20:53,551 --> 01:20:58,551
pro inflammatory and very much moving 
you towards this insulin resistant 

1701
01:20:58,551 --> 01:21:02,181
profile.
Now what is it about sugar where when 

1702
01:21:02,181 --> 01:21:03,630
you are not consuming it on a regular 
basis,

1703
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:06,090
um,
and then you take some time.

1704
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:09,720
Like I've,
I've gotten like really strict ketogenic

1705
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:14,721
for four or five months and then I'll go
off and have like a milkshake and fries 

1706
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:17,730
and I can't fucking believe how bad I 
feel.

1707
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:22,960
And I've got to think that there's,
my body just doesn't know what to do 

1708
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:22,960
with it anymore.
It doesn't,

1709
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,450
um,
during the state of ketosis,

1710
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:28,440
so you say normal time,
normally the brain runs off glucose,

1711
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:30,360
but what's really normal,
like I,

1712
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:34,890
for me normal is trying to look at this 
from this ancestral template,

1713
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:36,600
you know,
and so for eons,

1714
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:41,870
humans and every other organism on the 
planet didn't have consistent food and 

1715
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:44,130
because our brain is so big and it's so 
metabolically active,

1716
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:47,490
even though I think it's like two 
percent of our body weight,

1717
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:52,491
but 20 percent of the energy use,
it's really important that we protect 

1718
01:21:52,491 --> 01:21:56,661
that.
And so The process of ketosis is a 

1719
01:21:56,661 --> 01:22:00,141
workaround so that we don't have to 
break down protein to convert it into 

1720
01:22:00,141 --> 01:22:00,141
glucose.

1721
01:22:00,141 --> 01:22:01,410
To feed the brain.
We can break down body fat.

1722
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:06,770
The body fat gets turned into ketone 
bodies which are water soluble and can 

1723
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:10,641
go through the blood brain barrier and 
that can fuel the brain in a really 

1724
01:22:10,641 --> 01:22:10,980
effective way.
But when you do that,

1725
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:13,530
what you are trying to do with spare 
glucose,

1726
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:16,200
just for the brain,
just for the red blood cells,

1727
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:19,890
the few tissues that have to run on 
glucose like they have no,

1728
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:24,300
no other work around red blood cells,
and then some parts of the brain like so

1729
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:29,301
some parts of the brain,
if you're on a really restricted sugar 

1730
01:22:29,301 --> 01:22:33,021
diet,
they will suffer it initially until you 

1731
01:22:33,021 --> 01:22:35,240
get ramped up into ketosis and then 
you're fueling more.

1732
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,960
The brain in the numbers vary.
Uh,

1733
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:42,210
the somewhere between 70,
80 percent of the brain can shift over 

1734
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:44,700
fully to ketone body metabolism,
but the other 20 can't,

1735
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:45,900
can't 20 to 30.

1736
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:47,550
And we always,
even in ketosis,

1737
01:22:47,551 --> 01:22:52,410
we still have a blood glucose level 
that's being metered out by the liver.

1738
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:58,010
But what the body does is it creates 
what's called a metabolic insulin 

1739
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:02,481
resistance where the muscles become 
insulin resistant so that we don't use 

1740
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:07,210
glucose in the muscles were using free 
acids and we're using ketone bodies.

1741
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:10,420
So then you go and you've been ketotic 
for awhile.

1742
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:15,690
You have physiological insulin 
resistance to support and maintain that 

1743
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:16,900
qi tonic state.
That's totally fine,

1744
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:20,650
but then your first meal out of that is 
like the milkshake,

1745
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:22,710
you knoW,
a fries,

1746
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:27,720
you know,
200 grams of carbohydrate and because 

1747
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,360
you're physiologically insulin 
resistant,

1748
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:33,450
it takes a massive amount of insulin to 
be able to push that stuff into storage 

1749
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:36,040
and it will make you feel like death.
I feel terrible.

1750
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:41,041
I always need a nap.
I feel like I have headaches and I'm 

1751
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:41,041
like,
what kind of a pussy if I become like,

1752
01:23:41,041 --> 01:23:43,600
what's happening here because I used to,
used to be easy for me.

1753
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,850
Right.
And you know that there's some,

1754
01:23:46,170 --> 01:23:51,170
it's an interesting trade off because 
you could make an argument that we 

1755
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:52,840
should be able to live like a cockroach 
and like you just,

1756
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:54,490
you know,
you bounce back and forth,

1757
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:59,520
you know,
under ideal circumstances we would be 

1758
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:01,960
resilient and we could be able to shift 
these fuel substrates.

1759
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:06,990
And this is some of the argument for 
like intermittent fasting where you 

1760
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:10,981
force your body to run off of fats and 
maybe you do a carbohydrates every 

1761
01:24:11,111 --> 01:24:16,111
couple of days or maybe earlier in the 
day and then later in the day it's just 

1762
01:24:16,111 --> 01:24:20,010
a fat and protein and then you fast 
through part of the next day so that 

1763
01:24:20,201 --> 01:24:23,650
you're forcing your body to run off fat 
to produce some key tones,

1764
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,560
maybe not at a level of full nutritional
ketosis.

1765
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,080
But then also when you do drop in some 
carbs,

1766
01:24:29,081 --> 01:24:34,081
your body can handle that and it doesn't
put you into that kinda like diabetic 

1767
01:24:34,081 --> 01:24:34,540
blood sugar levels.

1768
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:35,110
And,
and,

1769
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,150
uh,
it's all really speculative.

1770
01:24:37,151 --> 01:24:40,540
I don't really know what the right 
answer is with any of that stuff,

1771
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:44,750
but it is interesting and it does kind 
of call into question the,

1772
01:24:44,790 --> 01:24:49,790
you know,
how useful is chronic ketosis relative 

1773
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:51,400
to being able to cycle in and out of it.
And I don't have a good answer,

1774
01:24:51,401 --> 01:24:53,890
but I definitely feel best when I'm qi 
tonic.

1775
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:59,310
You feel best when your qi tonic,
but you tend to do a little bit higher 

1776
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,760
carbohydrate to fuel the jujitsu,
jujitsu.

1777
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:06,060
So,
and that doesn't knock you out of a 

1778
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:06,060
state of ketosis as long as you've been 
fairly consistent.

1779
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:07,090
It does.
And I do.

1780
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:11,560
So when I'm fully keto adapted,
the blood ketone levels are higher.

1781
01:25:11,561 --> 01:25:13,690
And also like if I needed to miss a 
meal,

1782
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:15,160
you know,
if I just didn't get breakfast,

1783
01:25:15,161 --> 01:25:15,730
lunch,
dinner,

1784
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:18,490
and I want a full day,
it would be inconsequential,

1785
01:25:18,491 --> 01:25:21,000
like I would be a little hungry,
but it really wouldn't affect me.

1786
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,980
That's the biggest benefit of opinions.
Huge.

1787
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:29,040
And so when I do that 75 to 120 grams of
carbs to fuel the jujitsu,

1788
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:34,180
I can't do that as easy,
like 10 hours and 12 hours in of uh,

1789
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:35,070
you know,
uh,

1790
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:37,240
so I sleep.
I'll sleep through the night.

1791
01:25:37,241 --> 01:25:39,420
So I've got a 12 hour fast then I get up
in,

1792
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,530
if I tried to go to 6:00
PM that day,

1793
01:25:41,620 --> 01:25:46,620
I'd be hungry.
I wouldn't be totally broken down 

1794
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:48,550
dysfunctional like I was when I was know
insulin resistant sugar burner.

1795
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:51,220
But it's not the same as being keto 
adapted now.

1796
01:25:51,221 --> 01:25:54,160
Do you mess it all with exogenous 
ketones?

1797
01:25:54,161 --> 01:25:57,190
I do a little bit,
but the ketone salts give me the trots.

1798
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:59,650
So Yeah.
So those are kind of rough.

1799
01:25:59,651 --> 01:26:04,651
I do a lot of the,
a caveman coffee and then they're mct 

1800
01:26:04,651 --> 01:26:08,260
oil and I'll actually mix that up with 
peanut butter and then either a soy 

1801
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:11,930
lecithin or a sunflower less than 
because it kind of a multifocal.

1802
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:14,540
All that stuff.
So I'll mix it up together and then I'll

1803
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:19,570
eat that and I get a decent point five 
millimolar blood ketone level off of 

1804
01:26:20,221 --> 01:26:22,100
that even though I'm eating some carbs 
with it.

1805
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:27,400
That's interesting.
So now you're your peanut butter is a 

1806
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:28,370
sugar free peanut butter natural peanut 
butter peanut butter peanut butter.

1807
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:29,450
People say,
oh jeff,

1808
01:26:29,451 --> 01:26:32,230
I'm going to just eat it by the tub and 
while you will.

1809
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:37,240
And then peanuts or are legumes.
And so there's a bunch of like super 

1810
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:42,071
hardcore paleo folks that are freaking 
out and dying right now that I'm eating 

1811
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:45,971
peanut butter.
So now why don't paleo people like 

1812
01:26:45,971 --> 01:26:46,130
peanuts?
What the fuck's wrong with them?

1813
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:50,780
So legumes do have some,
what we call immunogenic properties.

1814
01:26:50,781 --> 01:26:55,781
They can irritate the immune system and 
if you improperly prepare them then they

1815
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:58,160
can make you really sick.
Like if you.

1816
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:01,180
If you cooked some black beans or kidney
beans or something,

1817
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:02,690
you didn't cook them enough and you 
weighed them,

1818
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:04,720
it can give you gas,
right?

1819
01:27:04,721 --> 01:27:07,190
It's like where you're shitting blood 
essentially.

1820
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:12,580
It's pretty pretty nasty stuff and these
are the anti predation chemicals that 

1821
01:27:12,580 --> 01:27:15,440
are in grains and legumes,
but if you soak them overnight,

1822
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:20,490
you pull off the rinse water,
maybe sprout them for a day and you 

1823
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,460
don't even have to do that involved.
Or if you cook them in a medium that has

1824
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:27,461
a little bit of acid in it,
then it tends to break down these anti 

1825
01:27:27,461 --> 01:27:27,980
nutrients and they're not nearly as 
immunogenic,

1826
01:27:27,981 --> 01:27:32,530
but somebody who has serious gi problems
and this circles back again to that,

1827
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:34,670
that small intestinal bacterial 
overgrowth.

1828
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:37,790
Somebody who has cbo,
somebody has some other gi probLems.

1829
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:41,810
if they have an autoimmune condition,
grains and legumes may be something that

1830
01:27:41,811 --> 01:27:44,390
you want to minimize because it is 
immunogenic.

1831
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:49,390
For a lot of people,
and this is the success that we've seen 

1832
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,210
with this autoimmune paleo approach.
So I think that the,

1833
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:54,830
the unfortunate thIng is on the one 
hand,

1834
01:27:54,831 --> 01:27:59,831
there are a lot of people who dismissed 
the power of limiting these foods in 

1835
01:27:59,831 --> 01:28:03,971
people that would benefit their.
Like there's no science to support it 

1836
01:28:03,971 --> 01:28:05,810
and they've never invested a minute 
towards researching it.

1837
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:08,600
So they're ignorant about that.
But then on the other side,

1838
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:13,601
there's a whole group of people that 
maybe they had success with this 

1839
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:15,290
autoimmune paleo protocol.
They had ulcerative colitis,

1840
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:18,080
they had multiple sclerosis,
they had success for it.

1841
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:23,530
Now they say that nobody can or should 
eat these foods and you know,

1842
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:26,210
I,
I've got to throw myself under the bus.

1843
01:28:26,211 --> 01:28:28,730
I've probably been that person for a 
decade or longer,

1844
01:28:28,731 --> 01:28:30,710
you know,
but over the course of time,

1845
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:32,960
just life it,
it's that jujitsu thing again,

1846
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:35,300
you know,
where it's like the truth will pound you

1847
01:28:35,960 --> 01:28:40,960
and at some point you either get it or 
you just become this like calcified old 

1848
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,320
turd and you can't learn or grow.

1849
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:47,770
And over the course of time,
it just became obvious that if your gut 

1850
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:48,500
is healthy,
if all the cylinders are firing,

1851
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:53,980
doing some grains and legumes is 
probably not going to be a negative 

1852
01:28:53,980 --> 01:28:57,050
problem for you,
but if you are a cop or a firefighter in

1853
01:28:57,051 --> 01:29:02,051
the military and you've historically 
been able to eat these foods and then 

1854
01:29:02,051 --> 01:29:05,711
you go to a shift work schedule and 
you're under a massive amount of stress 

1855
01:29:05,711 --> 01:29:09,351
because of an altered sleep wake cycle,
those foods that may have been okay may 

1856
01:29:09,351 --> 01:29:13,851
no longer now be okay.
And so that's another piece that people 

1857
01:29:13,851 --> 01:29:18,021
just need to remain open.
That something that's working for you 

1858
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:19,200
today may not work for you tomorrow.
And then you know,

1859
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:21,650
something that worked for me may not 
work for this other person.

1860
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:26,660
It's kind of common sense,
but people just desperately in this 

1861
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:26,660
health,
wellness,

1862
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:29,370
nutrition realm,
they want black or white,

1863
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,380
yes or no binary stuff.

1864
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:32,760
This is good,
that's bad.

1865
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:37,790
And as much as I would,
it would make my life way simpler if 

1866
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:41,571
that was the case.
But it's just not like there's all this 

1867
01:29:41,571 --> 01:29:42,630
variability in there.
Are you familiar with the dunning kruger

1868
01:29:42,631 --> 01:29:44,010
effect?
Yes.

1869
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:45,000
Okay.
So yeah,

1870
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:48,000
so dunning kruger effect,
like if you do like the x,

1871
01:29:48,001 --> 01:29:52,170
y axis,
the x axis is going out and this is time

1872
01:29:52,171 --> 01:29:57,171
and the y axis is your perceived 
knowledge on a topic when you don't have

1873
01:29:57,301 --> 01:29:59,880
any time in a topic,
then you assume that you know everything

1874
01:29:59,881 --> 01:30:04,881
about it and they call it mount stupid.
And I spent a lot of time in mount 

1875
01:30:04,881 --> 01:30:05,250
stupid and um,
as we all,

1876
01:30:05,380 --> 01:30:07,950
as we all have.
And then there's this low,

1877
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:10,920
like low abv,
the dark teatime of the soul.

1878
01:30:10,921 --> 01:30:11,970
You know,
where you've been in it.

1879
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:12,690
Yeah,
there we go.

1880
01:30:13,140 --> 01:30:16,260
And so as that stretches out,
then you get some,

1881
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:19,040
hopefully some degree of aptitude,
but the,

1882
01:30:19,650 --> 01:30:24,650
as you learn more and more and more,
you're confident about any given topic 

1883
01:30:24,650 --> 01:30:25,230
just starts going down more and more.

1884
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:26,850
And I'm at this point now where I'm 
like,

1885
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:30,480
I don't know if I know anything about 
any topic.

1886
01:30:30,481 --> 01:30:32,640
And I guess that that's kind of a good 
process.

1887
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:36,390
Ten years ago I was much more confident 
about a whole host of things.

1888
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:38,610
It's like there's a right answer and 
there's a wrong answer,

1889
01:30:38,611 --> 01:30:41,790
and today I just really don't know.
Yeah,

1890
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:45,600
there's a great expression about that.
As the lake of knowledge increases,

1891
01:30:45,601 --> 01:30:47,790
the shoreline of ignorance grows as 
well.

1892
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:53,440
Yeah.
I think dennis mckenna had to take onto 

1893
01:30:53,440 --> 01:30:56,271
that.
As you increase the bonfire of 

1894
01:30:56,271 --> 01:30:58,191
knowledge,
it exposes the greater level of 

1895
01:30:58,191 --> 01:31:01,850
ignorance the light does.
It's a natural human tendency for some 

1896
01:31:02,341 --> 01:31:07,341
strange reason to want to know 
everything or to want to pretend you 

1897
01:31:07,341 --> 01:31:07,341
know,
everything.

1898
01:31:07,341 --> 01:31:07,590
It's like a defensive mechanism or 
something.

1899
01:31:07,591 --> 01:31:12,591
Definitely is a defensive mechanism and 
it's just so appealing to to basically 

1900
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:16,830
put a fence around what your current 
knowledge status and be like.

1901
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,150
There it is.
We're good.

1902
01:31:18,151 --> 01:31:21,270
You know,
it's a really tough deal to just kind of

1903
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,250
dangling the breeze and to hang that 
sign,

1904
01:31:23,251 --> 01:31:23,850
you know?
good.

1905
01:31:23,851 --> 01:31:25,260
Until further notice.
Yeah,

1906
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:30,350
and that's why today it's so weird 
because you can find other people that 

1907
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:33,291
agree with you on that and they pump you
up and give you that confirmation bias 

1908
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:36,570
and they support each other and they get
together and make fun of everybody who's

1909
01:31:36,571 --> 01:31:39,510
not in the nose.
That hashtag woke.

1910
01:31:39,670 --> 01:31:41,610
Right?
Oh god.

1911
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:47,930
And you know,
I had a lot of that like running across 

1912
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,150
fit type gym.
I would recommend this low carb paleo 

1913
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:52,530
type of approach and for people that 
were insulin resistant,

1914
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,930
overweight,
it worked amazingly well.

1915
01:31:55,470 --> 01:32:00,470
And then when I started working with 
more mma oriented folks and a cross 

1916
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,310
fitters,
they,

1917
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,280
it took a long time and breaking a lot 
of people to figure out,

1918
01:32:06,281 --> 01:32:07,990
okay,
these people need some more carbs,

1919
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:12,991
you know,
like they may not need as much as what 

1920
01:32:12,991 --> 01:32:14,851
they've historically done,
but there's fully quito fuel process is 

1921
01:32:14,851 --> 01:32:15,400
probably not going to work with them.

1922
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,100
And it broke some people,
including myself.

1923
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:23,160
What's very hard for people to wrap 
their head around the idea that eating 

1924
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,881
fruit is not a good idea.
Like eating too much fruit could be bad 

1925
01:32:26,881 --> 01:32:26,881
for you.
People are lIke,

1926
01:32:26,881 --> 01:32:27,160
what?
Right,

1927
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:32,161
you can eat a banana and some 
strawberries and some grapes and an 

1928
01:32:32,161 --> 01:32:34,990
orange and I feel great and some people 
might,

1929
01:32:34,991 --> 01:32:37,500
but there's a lot of people that can get
in the deep end of the,

1930
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,500
the,
you know,

1931
01:32:38,501 --> 01:32:40,910
the blood sugar management story with 
that.

1932
01:32:41,030 --> 01:32:42,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

1933
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:45,220
That seems so counterintuitive to what 
we've been told as kids.

1934
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:47,290
Like you have some fruit,
it's good for you.

1935
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:49,030
It tastes good and it's good for you.
You're like,

1936
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:49,570
oh,
okay,

1937
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:50,590
great.
it's good for you.

1938
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,060
Well,
it's interesting.

1939
01:32:52,061 --> 01:32:53,010
We have these,
uh,

1940
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:58,470
old variety crab apples on my property,
johnny appleseed kind of deal and that's

1941
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:00,820
what apple's effectively used to be.

1942
01:33:00,850 --> 01:33:02,710
We can narrow those at each other.
Yeah,

1943
01:33:02,790 --> 01:33:04,660
we,
we make cider out of it and it turns,

1944
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,250
turns pretty good for that.
But uh,

1945
01:33:07,380 --> 01:33:11,440
if you pull up like an image of what an 
original banana looks like,

1946
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:12,310
oh,
they're ridiculous.

1947
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,960
Like seed.
Yeah.

1948
01:33:13,961 --> 01:33:17,980
It's tiny and it's all seeds and there's
hardly any edible structure to it.

1949
01:33:17,981 --> 01:33:22,981
And so if you look at most of the fruit 
that was available kind of pre 

1950
01:33:22,981 --> 01:33:22,981
agriculture and that,
that,

1951
01:33:22,981 --> 01:33:26,080
uh,
a selective breeding of fruit,

1952
01:33:26,081 --> 01:33:28,360
like it was much smaller,
wasn't as sweet.

1953
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:33,810
And again,
it's not to say that you shouldn't have 

1954
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:33,810
any of that stuff,
but it's just,

1955
01:33:33,810 --> 01:33:37,770
there was a interesting piece that came 
out of the uk where it was looking at 

1956
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,800
feeding kids fruit.
They were like,

1957
01:33:38,801 --> 01:33:43,801
let's,
let's recommend that these kids eat 

1958
01:33:43,801 --> 01:33:44,590
fruit and the kids already had a hyper 
caloric diet.

1959
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,000
They were eating too much.

1960
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:51,090
They were eating too many carbs and then
they threw fruit on top of it and 

1961
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:51,130
they're like,
wow,

1962
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:55,660
adding fruit to this already shitty 
overeating program made it worse,

1963
01:33:55,661 --> 01:34:00,661
you know?
And it was like there was going to be 

1964
01:34:00,661 --> 01:34:01,810
some sort of magic that came out of 
adding some fruit to this story.

1965
01:34:01,811 --> 01:34:06,811
Whereas the kids just needed to pull 
more of the junk out and get some sort 

1966
01:34:06,811 --> 01:34:11,041
of both caloric control land.
Some carbohydrate control is really 

1967
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:15,811
interesting.
Is there any fruit that is in its 

1968
01:34:15,811 --> 01:34:15,811
original state?
Like maybe pomegranates,

1969
01:34:15,811 --> 01:34:18,370
they kinda berries are pretty pretty,
you know,

1970
01:34:18,371 --> 01:34:19,480
uh,
blueberries,

1971
01:34:19,481 --> 01:34:24,481
blackberries,
so sorts of things while they're pretty 

1972
01:34:24,481 --> 01:34:26,060
similar to that.
Sweet.

1973
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,850
Not that sweet.
No different.

1974
01:34:27,851 --> 01:34:28,740
Different flavor.
Yeah.

1975
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:29,680
No.
Yeah,

1976
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:32,200
I've,
I've picked them like in the wild,

1977
01:34:32,230 --> 01:34:35,050
like in the back country,
like a blueberry and it just like,

1978
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,520
hmm,
this is not bad,

1979
01:34:36,521 --> 01:34:37,660
but it's not spectacular.

1980
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:39,220
It's not what you're used to.
Yeah.

1981
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:40,010
Yeah.
Uh,

1982
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:43,960
but oranges clearly they have been 
fucked with,

1983
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:44,580
right?
Yeah.

1984
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:49,620
Apple's like we were on a trip once and 
bought these apples and they were 

1985
01:34:49,811 --> 01:34:52,960
literally like the size of a softball 
and you bite into it.

1986
01:34:52,961 --> 01:34:55,210
It's like the most delicious dessert you
could ever have.

1987
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:58,010
Like this can't be a fucking real 
regular apple.

1988
01:34:58,011 --> 01:34:59,280
Right.
Something's been going on.

1989
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:00,580
Or noble apple.
I mean,

1990
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:03,080
how much of our food,
I mean especially at our fruit,

1991
01:35:03,081 --> 01:35:08,081
how much of it is genetically altered?
It's got to be massive amounts and you 

1992
01:35:08,081 --> 01:35:10,190
know,
that gmo story.

1993
01:35:10,191 --> 01:35:15,191
I'm in a spot where I usually piss 
everybody off about it because I am way 

1994
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:20,351
less concerned about genetic 
modification of these things and more 

1995
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:22,960
concerned about some of the business 
practices that happen,

1996
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:27,970
like we've been doing selective breeding
for thousands of years and that has 

1997
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:29,990
modified the genetics back to the wolf,
turning into dog story like that,

1998
01:35:29,991 --> 01:35:31,970
tomatoes,
everything and without.

1999
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:37,160
I mean the classic thoughts of franken 
foods meaning laboratory,

2000
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,000
some sort of injection into that's not 
what's going on.

2001
01:35:41,030 --> 01:35:46,030
Selective breeding for the most part,
most of it's selective breeding and the 

2002
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:47,570
thing about gmo to is the apologist for 
it.

2003
01:35:47,571 --> 01:35:51,500
Like when you look at the results that 
you get with the gmo,

2004
01:35:51,501 --> 01:35:54,680
the genetic modification,
it's really unimpressive.

2005
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,170
I mean it's not like dramatically 
increasing yields.

2006
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:03,560
What it inevitably is doing is creating 
something that's usually more resistant 

2007
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:07,210
to roundup than what the last thing was 
wound up being that pesticide foster,

2008
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,110
yeah.
Yeah.

2009
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:13,120
Which is legitimately some pretty nasty 
stuff and so it doesn't really seem to 

2010
01:36:13,401 --> 01:36:17,450
be working any type of magic as far as 
feeding the world or anything like that.

2011
01:36:17,451 --> 01:36:21,140
It is creating a funnel where in order 
to grow this thing,

2012
01:36:21,141 --> 01:36:26,141
you need more chemical fertilizer input,
you need more pesticide input and it 

2013
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:29,240
just seems to be this feed forward 
mechanism on that.

2014
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:32,220
And so I'm,
I'm really from a health standpoint,

2015
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:36,050
I'm not that freaked out aBout gmos just
as a baseline,

2016
01:36:36,051 --> 01:36:39,170
but from a really shady business 
practice.

2017
01:36:39,230 --> 01:36:41,110
I'm not a big fan from a,
uh,

2018
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:43,640
actually moving the needle on food 
production.

2019
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,760
It's really unimpressive to me.
So I,

2020
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:52,120
my position on gmos usually just makes 
everybody mad because I'm not really 

2021
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,450
jumping into either one of these,
these camps,

2022
01:36:53,451 --> 01:36:55,580
whole hog with food production in 
general.

2023
01:36:55,581 --> 01:36:58,550
When you look at these gigantic large 
scale farms that has,

2024
01:36:58,580 --> 01:37:01,730
that is one of the most unnatural things
you're ever going to see in life.

2025
01:37:01,850 --> 01:37:04,310
Right?
There's giant cornfields,

2026
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,900
right?
That's so unnatural,

2027
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:07,160
right?
monocrop.

2028
01:37:07,190 --> 01:37:08,660
Yeah.
And not only that monocrop,

2029
01:37:08,661 --> 01:37:12,400
but those are genetically modified crops
and you know,

2030
01:37:12,401 --> 01:37:17,401
and you want to kill off all the weeds,
spraying your genetiCally modified mono 

2031
01:37:17,401 --> 01:37:18,470
crops with some shit that kills off 
everything,

2032
01:37:18,471 --> 01:37:23,471
but you're genetically modified model 
crops and who knows what that 

2033
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:24,470
consequences on the human body will.

2034
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:30,540
So a roundup is now being suggested or 
has been suggested for a long time as a 

2035
01:37:31,131 --> 01:37:34,940
mitochondrial disruptor,
similar to that antibiotic story.

2036
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:38,030
So tHis is where people,
you know the last questions about like,

2037
01:37:38,031 --> 01:37:40,250
well what about this gluten intolerance 
thing?

2038
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:43,610
Like people didn't have it 50 years ago,
why is it going on now?

2039
01:37:43,611 --> 01:37:46,220
And we really don't know,
but maybe it's antibiotics,

2040
01:37:46,221 --> 01:37:48,290
maybe it's changes in the gut 
microbiome,

2041
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:52,370
but a lot of this stuff seems to have a 
mitochondrial dysfunction piece to it.

2042
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:53,990
Parkinson's,
alzheimer's,

2043
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:58,991
type two diabetes.
They all seem to have mitochondrial 

2044
01:37:58,991 --> 01:38:01,260
dysfunction elements to them.
The mitochondria is not producing energy

2045
01:38:01,261 --> 01:38:04,320
the way that it should.
And back again to that point about being

2046
01:38:04,321 --> 01:38:09,321
flexible with our fuel systems,
people seem to becoming inflexible in 

2047
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:13,611
their fuel systems.
and this key todrick state may be the 

2048
01:38:13,611 --> 01:38:17,451
default that we're able to go back to to
be able to maintain some degree of 

2049
01:38:17,451 --> 01:38:21,231
health and it also seems to press a 
reset button in the mitochondria where 

2050
01:38:21,231 --> 01:38:24,120
we get apoptosis and cell death and 
abnormal cells,

2051
01:38:24,121 --> 01:38:29,121
but the need for people to shift towards
a lower carb diet may be reflective of 

2052
01:38:29,121 --> 01:38:33,861
some changes in the environment where 
we're being made sick by things like 

2053
01:38:33,861 --> 01:38:38,481
glyophosphate or maybe an over 
aggressive antibiotic use and then the 

2054
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:43,131
thing that we need to default back to to
be able to be healthy as some sort of a 

2055
01:38:43,131 --> 01:38:43,131
low carb or ketogenic diet.

2056
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:48,590
Now,
when you're talking about foods and 

2057
01:38:48,590 --> 01:38:52,491
foods that people eat and breads and 
gluten deficiencies or gluten 

2058
01:38:52,491 --> 01:38:56,660
intolerances,
what about sprouted breads and what are 

2059
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:59,941
the.
What are the difference between 

2060
01:38:59,941 --> 01:38:59,941
something like a zucchini bread and say 
like a wonder bread?

2061
01:38:59,941 --> 01:39:01,080
Yeah,
so within the zucchini bread,

2062
01:39:01,081 --> 01:39:03,750
they soak these grains,
pour off the water,

2063
01:39:03,751 --> 01:39:06,030
let them sprout,
and in that sprouting process,

2064
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:10,800
the enzymes that are released tend to 
break up the gluten and gluten proteins.

2065
01:39:11,190 --> 01:39:16,190
And for a lot of people who are gluten 
intolerant with like a piece of wonder 

2066
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:20,151
bread or standard french bread,
they could eat something like these 

2067
01:39:20,151 --> 01:39:20,370
equal bread.
Not everybody can.

2068
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:25,371
I can't.
Like if I had a piece when I hit your 

2069
01:39:25,371 --> 01:39:29,061
bathroom,
it would need a priest and an exorcism 

2070
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:30,870
that you would break it over and you 
know I was never.

2071
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:33,750
We've looked at celiac is a gluten 
intolerance,

2072
01:39:33,751 --> 01:39:38,751
but if I get some sort of a wheat 
exposure and it's to the degree that 

2073
01:39:38,751 --> 01:39:42,390
like if a steak is grilled on a grill 
and somebody grilled french toast on the

2074
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,820
grilled the day before,
I'm going to be sick from it.

2075
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:47,040
So I'm like the canary in the coal mine 
on it sucks.

2076
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:48,780
It's amazing.
Fascinating.

2077
01:39:48,781 --> 01:39:53,781
But does it have any bay?
Does it have any effect on nutrient 

2078
01:39:53,781 --> 01:39:56,331
absorption because of the celiacs?
A big part of it is when you're exposed 

2079
01:39:56,521 --> 01:40:01,521
to that bread,
it's not just that you go to get 

2080
01:40:01,521 --> 01:40:01,521
diarrhea,
but they.

2081
01:40:01,521 --> 01:40:01,521
The nutrients are not getting into your 
system.

2082
01:40:01,521 --> 01:40:03,060
Right?
Because of the intestinal permeability.

2083
01:40:03,061 --> 01:40:05,220
The way I got into all this stuff,
I was really,

2084
01:40:05,221 --> 01:40:10,221
really sick.
And had all sort of colitis and I'm 

2085
01:40:10,221 --> 01:40:12,360
about 175 pounds right now when my 
ulcerative colitis was at its worst,

2086
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:16,410
I was 130 pounds.
So I was 40 pounds skinnier.

2087
01:40:16,411 --> 01:40:18,380
How old are you?
I'm 45 now.

2088
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:20,460
But now how old were you then at that 
point?

2089
01:40:20,461 --> 01:40:21,810
I was like 27,
28.

2090
01:40:21,870 --> 01:40:23,430
oh wow.
Yeah.

2091
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,350
So look like death.
I,

2092
01:40:25,351 --> 01:40:28,170
I looked like concentrAtion camp deal.
yeah.

2093
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:31,200
And it was just malabsorption,
like I couldn't absorb anything.

2094
01:40:31,201 --> 01:40:34,950
I was shoveling food down and for me at 
that point it was a high,

2095
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:38,190
it was a grain and legume based kind of 
a vegan diet,

2096
01:40:38,191 --> 01:40:42,750
which for me was just not working for 
that point in my life.

2097
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:48,290
Living in seattle,
not having any sun like that was a 

2098
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:48,290
really,
really bad move forming it.

2099
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:52,850
But I will say this,
this was also on the heels of getting 

2100
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:54,190
and resolving at least to degree grd.

2101
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:58,330
So I think that parasitic infection,
low vitamin d levels,

2102
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:01,180
bad sleep,
bad circadian rhythm,

2103
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:04,420
like all that stuff fed into it.
And so for combination there.

2104
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:09,510
yeah,
if you want to get taken down at the 

2105
01:41:09,510 --> 01:41:09,640
necaps that was a good way to do it.
And to cure giardia,

2106
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:12,130
what did they give you?
Might trinitas hall,

2107
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:17,220
which is a antimicrobial that they use 
for things like grd and then also some 

2108
01:41:18,221 --> 01:41:21,050
of the rk bactor bacteria.
so,

2109
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:24,040
so these kind of parasitic bacteria type
things.

2110
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:26,620
And does that have an effect on 
mitochondria as well?

2111
01:41:26,621 --> 01:41:29,590
The same way the antibiotics do I.
It's not the same way,

2112
01:41:29,591 --> 01:41:31,960
but it is a mitochondrial disruptor as 
well.

2113
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:32,840
Yeah.
What,

2114
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:37,210
what is a pro mitochondria supplement?
Is there anything then?

2115
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:40,780
so like resveratrol,
fasting,

2116
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:46,920
ketosis,
those things all tend to flip some 

2117
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:48,820
switches in the mitochondria that make 
them healthier and more robust,

2118
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:54,340
variable varying things rather on a 
reservoir trawl being absorbable,

2119
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:57,280
it's very difficult to absorb it.

2120
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:58,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

2121
01:41:58,900 --> 01:42:01,120
What is the best way?
I'm usually,

2122
01:42:01,121 --> 01:42:04,150
it's some sort of an emulsification with
fat and,

2123
01:42:04,151 --> 01:42:05,050
and uh,
you know,

2124
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:08,170
life realized and so it's,
it's quite fat soluble.

2125
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:10,480
So if you can get it mixed into a fatty 
matrix,

2126
01:42:10,481 --> 01:42:13,060
then it enhances the absorption.
But it does seem to.

2127
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:14,170
And,
and you know,

2128
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,470
most of this data is petri dish type 
data,

2129
01:42:17,471 --> 01:42:22,471
so we really don't know if it's having 
great effect in the body and then 

2130
01:42:22,471 --> 01:42:27,300
there's another layer to this.
A Ton of these polyphenolics don't 

2131
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:30,280
really enter the body or they don't 
enter the body as the original chemical.

2132
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:35,550
They get modified by the gut bacteria 
and then either the gut bacteria 

2133
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:39,721
manufacturer completely different 
chemical or some sort of downstream 

2134
01:42:39,721 --> 01:42:43,020
chemical is what enters the body,
or it may just interface with the gut 

2135
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:46,831
lining and then the gut sends out 
different signaling molecules that then 

2136
01:42:46,831 --> 01:42:46,831
affects the rest of the body.

2137
01:42:46,831 --> 01:42:51,780
Wow.
So it depends upon the healthiness of 

2138
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:54,631
your gut bacteria.
It that's a massive impact.

2139
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:59,990
it has a massive impact on whether or 
not that [inaudible] or other similar 

2140
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:01,060
nutrients get an just pharmaceuticals in
general.

2141
01:43:01,061 --> 01:43:03,580
Like when you look at people going on a 
heart med or you know,

2142
01:43:03,581 --> 01:43:08,581
different things like depending what 
something that their understanding is 

2143
01:43:08,581 --> 01:43:11,731
not only do we have genetic differences,
but the differences in the gut 

2144
01:43:11,731 --> 01:43:14,500
microbiome may have a really profound 
influence in the way that people respond

2145
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:16,840
to supplements.
Pharmaceuticals,

2146
01:43:16,841 --> 01:43:17,800
yeah.
Yeah.

2147
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:23,070
It's just so much to take in for the 
person and the average person is 

2148
01:43:23,070 --> 01:43:25,420
listening to this that wants to sort of 
optimize their health.

2149
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:29,410
There's so many.
There should Be like.

2150
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:34,620
It's kind of amazing.
I guess it's a lot of this is because 

2151
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:37,471
this is a fairly new discipline in terms
of the last few decades and guys like 

2152
01:43:37,471 --> 01:43:37,750
you who are on the forefront of it.

2153
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:41,260
I've done some person and chris kresser 
who's gone through his own deal.

2154
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:46,470
He was a macrobiotic vegan point in time
and now he tells you to eat liver and,

2155
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,670
and you and you should see pictures of 
it.

2156
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:53,690
He ended up getting a really nasty gut 
bug in I think the Philippines and um,

2157
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:59,060
pictures of him before.
He was like jacked super thick legs,

2158
01:43:59,061 --> 01:44:04,061
like thick neck tie boxer and now he's 
pretty wavy and he's never really been 

2159
01:44:04,061 --> 01:44:07,760
able to put all the weight back on and 
kind of get back to is as robust as what

2160
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:11,450
he was before that.
But it was another situation where maybe

2161
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:16,451
some irritation to the gut because of 
the diet and indefinitely this 

2162
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:17,780
infectious agent,
whatever the bug was that he caught,

2163
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:22,781
just crushed him.
There should be some sort of a place 

2164
01:44:22,781 --> 01:44:24,860
that you could go like a string of 
places,

2165
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:30,040
you know,
where you can open them up in major 

2166
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:32,060
cities and metropolitan areas where 
someone can go and find out like what is

2167
01:44:32,061 --> 01:44:32,990
the right stuff to do?

2168
01:44:33,020 --> 01:44:38,020
I went to this one,
they did some blood work on me and the 

2169
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:38,960
lady told me,
avocados just don't agree with you.

2170
01:44:38,961 --> 01:44:40,220
I'm like,
fuck off.

2171
01:44:40,630 --> 01:44:42,560
That is so dumb.
TheRe's not a god I've.

2172
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:44,630
I eat avocados all the time.
They're great.

2173
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:49,220
There's just trying to come up with some
sort of ridiculous blood test that shows

2174
01:44:49,221 --> 01:44:50,240
the avocados.
I'm like,

2175
01:44:50,270 --> 01:44:51,320
that's not real,
right.

2176
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:52,460
That can't be real,
can it?

2177
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:57,530
There's not much again,
that that stuff gets really.

2178
01:44:57,950 --> 01:45:00,530
Especially avocado.
I know it's like damn avocado.

2179
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:05,210
So if somebody has intestinal 
permeability of for whatever reason,

2180
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:10,270
then you can become reactive unlike the 
igg antibody testing.

2181
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:15,700
But it does.
But the problem is not the food 

2182
01:45:15,700 --> 01:45:19,031
specifically.
The problem is that you have gut 

2183
01:45:19,031 --> 01:45:19,400
permeability,
so if they fix that gut permeability,

2184
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:24,760
then you're no longer really going to 
react to the food because the food 

2185
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:24,760
doesn't get into your body.

2186
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:29,440
Then you break it down into the protein,
into the amino acids and fatty acids in 

2187
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:34,210
the the constituent carbs,
and so the immunogenic properties that 

2188
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:36,260
it had before,
don't really matter because it's in your

2189
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:38,300
gut and when the contents are inside to 
get.

2190
01:45:38,301 --> 01:45:43,301
It's outside the body.
Is there any test that they can do with 

2191
01:45:43,301 --> 01:45:48,100
your blood that would show that in any 
way and is there any way that avocados,

2192
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:53,890
one of the healthiest food known to man 
could possibly be something you should 

2193
01:45:53,890 --> 01:45:56,440
avoid?
Avocados are a not uncommon allergens,

2194
01:45:56,441 --> 01:46:01,441
so some people do develop allergies to 
avocado seed essentially with that fruit

2195
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:07,751
around it.
So there are some immunogenic proteins 

2196
01:46:07,751 --> 01:46:11,021
to it.
It would have a pretty obvious reaction 

2197
01:46:11,021 --> 01:46:11,021
than if you were allergic to chocolate 
again,

2198
01:46:11,021 --> 01:46:15,370
and this is where the reaction wouldn't 
be grabbing another chip and dip it in 

2199
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:15,370
the guacamole.

2200
01:46:15,370 --> 01:46:15,950
That's awesome.
Yeah,

2201
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:19,750
and usually it's something like foggy 
headedness or a gi issue or you know,

2202
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:21,980
like joint creakiness or something like 
that.

2203
01:46:22,170 --> 01:46:24,160
Creakiness the joints actually 
physically make.

2204
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,520
They just don't feel so.
Yeah.

2205
01:46:26,850 --> 01:46:28,730
So it feels like they're.
yeah.

2206
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:34,020
Yeah.
What about sugar causes that 

2207
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:34,040
inflammation?
Because that is a big factor with people

2208
01:46:34,041 --> 01:46:37,370
that have injuries even if it's not 
injuries,

2209
01:46:37,371 --> 01:46:41,120
if they have joint pain,
like knee pains,

2210
01:46:41,121 --> 01:46:46,121
back pains.
I've had this conversation with people 

2211
01:46:46,121 --> 01:46:46,121
and I got it from a chiropractor.
She said,

2212
01:46:46,121 --> 01:46:47,990
believe it or not,
like gluten insensitivity,

2213
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:50,010
just reducing gluten and becoming gluten

2214
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:55,010
free will change the way injuries hurt 
like back injuries.

2215
01:46:55,051 --> 01:46:57,540
And I thought well that sounds like some
hippie bullshit.

2216
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:02,870
And so this was many years ago when I 
started getting into this idea of 

2217
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:06,351
inflammatory foods that are affecting 
the way your body and your joints 

2218
01:47:06,351 --> 01:47:09,321
particular field,
but she only took it to the point of 

2219
01:47:09,321 --> 01:47:09,321
gluten.
Right?

2220
01:47:09,321 --> 01:47:11,550
And then it wasn't a sugar thing for 
her.

2221
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:13,410
And then once I started looking into 
sugar,

2222
01:47:13,411 --> 01:47:13,800
I'm like,
oh,

2223
01:47:13,801 --> 01:47:16,200
these are all foods that cause 
inflammation.

2224
01:47:16,350 --> 01:47:17,340
Well,
what is happening?

2225
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:19,610
What causes it?
What?

2226
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:23,070
How does sugar or high sugar processed 
sugar diet,

2227
01:47:23,190 --> 01:47:26,880
how does that cause inflammation?
So a couple of different mechanisms that

2228
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:31,881
can happen here.
We we definitely understand that the 

2229
01:47:31,881 --> 01:47:34,530
sugar can feed bacteria,
both good and bad bacteria.

2230
01:47:34,590 --> 01:47:39,240
If most of the bacterial masto should be
occurring in the colon,

2231
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:44,241
like pretty far south,
and if we eat a diet that's really 

2232
01:47:44,241 --> 01:47:45,540
deficient in fiber,
high in refined carbohydrates,

2233
01:47:46,050 --> 01:47:50,820
all carbohydrates get absorbed early and
so there's not actually any food for the

2234
01:47:50,821 --> 01:47:52,740
bacteria that should be living in the 
colon.

2235
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:56,970
So these bacteria tend to move more,
more upward in the gi tract.

2236
01:47:56,971 --> 01:47:59,460
And this is where we get small 
intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

2237
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:04,910
Sibo is a pro inflammatory process,
so that's one way that we can get 

2238
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:09,981
inflammation out of that.
Another way is just when we get really 

2239
01:48:09,981 --> 01:48:13,671
wild swings in blood sugar,
that tends to be a pro inflammatory 

2240
01:48:13,671 --> 01:48:15,720
process.
So just the upregulation of insulin,

2241
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:20,721
particularly if it's over a chronic 
process that can be a pro inflammatory 

2242
01:48:20,721 --> 01:48:22,060
experience.
And then the other pieces,

2243
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:27,090
you know,
if you start getting cortisol released 

2244
01:48:27,090 --> 01:48:29,271
in response to blood sugar crashes 
because you get hypoglycemic and you're 

2245
01:48:29,271 --> 01:48:31,170
trying to ping the liver to release some
more glucose,

2246
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,740
that can be a pro inflammatory 
processes,

2247
01:48:33,780 --> 01:48:36,660
the inflammation,
what's the physical reaction?

2248
01:48:36,661 --> 01:48:38,730
Like what is happening when you say 
inflammation?

2249
01:48:38,731 --> 01:48:41,460
So there's a bunch of different 
mediators there,

2250
01:48:41,461 --> 01:48:43,440
so you've got different cytokines.

2251
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:48,440
These chemicals like interleukin one,
interleukin six that are turning on 

2252
01:48:48,440 --> 01:48:52,701
typically immune cells and then other 
cells in the body are being effected as 

2253
01:48:52,701 --> 01:48:57,081
Well,
but it's usually some sort of immune 

2254
01:48:57,081 --> 01:48:59,010
cell response which then they in their 
process and doing what they do,

2255
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,410
they tend to release chemicals,
cytokines,

2256
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:05,640
and in similar chemicals that it can 
turn into a feed forward mechanism.

2257
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:06,690
So the,
you know,

2258
01:49:06,691 --> 01:49:11,691
it's ultimately chemical messaging that 
can turn on other inflammatory processes

2259
01:49:13,231 --> 01:49:16,890
in cells that are nearby and also the 
immune cells themselves.

2260
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:22,610
So that is causing these joints to be 
painful and then back to the joint.

2261
01:49:23,821 --> 01:49:26,220
So whenever we do anything,
any type of workout,

2262
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:27,990
even just exercise.
So.

2263
01:49:27,991 --> 01:49:32,991
So this is important,
important point to make to inflammation 

2264
01:49:32,991 --> 01:49:36,020
in and of itself isn't necessarily bad,
it's the amount and type and placement 

2265
01:49:36,020 --> 01:49:40,341
and all that type of stuff.
So exercise is a proinflammatory 

2266
01:49:40,341 --> 01:49:42,480
process.
It's what we call a hormetic stress.

2267
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:47,500
So we get a little bit of this stress,
ideally an appropriate dose and the body

2268
01:49:47,501 --> 01:49:48,100
senses

2269
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:53,100
this stress and then it makes us 
stronger so that we can cope with a 

2270
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:56,750
subsequent exposure to this.
But if our sYstem is already pro 

2271
01:49:56,750 --> 01:50:00,280
inflamed from poor diet,
inadequate sleep,

2272
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:02,230
gut permeability,
what have you,

2273
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:03,850
than these little,
you know,

2274
01:50:03,851 --> 01:50:08,851
tears and bumps and bruises and 
adhesions that we get from physical 

2275
01:50:08,851 --> 01:50:12,241
activity,
they never really heal because our body 

2276
01:50:12,241 --> 01:50:15,361
is allocating resources to deal with the
inflammation in the gut and are kind of 

2277
01:50:15,361 --> 01:50:19,560
over hyped up inflammatory response and 
it doesn't have the resources to deal 

2278
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,630
with the inflammation in our joints and 
our muscles and whatnot.

2279
01:50:23,020 --> 01:50:23,890
Hm.
Interesting.

2280
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:29,070
So what,
what are the best anti inflammatories 

2281
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:30,460
supplements or foods that people can 
take?

2282
01:50:30,461 --> 01:50:35,461
Because ibuprofen is something you 
should pretty clearly avoid now using 

2283
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:37,050
sparingly.
Yeah,

2284
01:50:37,051 --> 01:50:42,051
and this is for,
for people that are not listening or 

2285
01:50:42,051 --> 01:50:42,051
that are listening to this,
that are not aware,

2286
01:50:42,051 --> 01:50:46,910
it's been shown over the last few years 
in particular that ibuprofen is exactly 

2287
01:50:47,561 --> 01:50:48,640
pretty dangerous.

2288
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:49,780
Um,
and,

2289
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,330
and can cause a host heart attack.
Yeah,

2290
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:57,340
it increases like 60 percent of strokes.
I'm a good friend of mine,

2291
01:50:57,341 --> 01:51:02,341
cameron hanes,
who's a marathon runner and an ultra 

2292
01:51:02,341 --> 01:51:02,710
marathon runner.
You used to take it every day and he was

2293
01:51:02,711 --> 01:51:03,880
always in pain.
Right.

2294
01:51:03,970 --> 01:51:08,970
And what was fascinating was I did a 
podcast with rhonda patrick where she 

2295
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:10,570
talked about the dangers of it and 
talked about how horrible it is for your

2296
01:51:10,571 --> 01:51:11,860
gut bacteria,
right?

2297
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:16,861
And that that could in fact be causing 
the actual inflammation that you're 

2298
01:51:16,861 --> 01:51:19,951
trying to fight with the ibuprofen.
Then this continual cycle and lupe got 

2299
01:51:19,951 --> 01:51:21,400
him off of it and his Joint pain went 
away.

2300
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:23,170
Right?
Which is just insane.

2301
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:25,240
You think,
how does this happen?

2302
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:30,440
How does this guy has joint pain all the
time and he's taken ibuprofen for the 

2303
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,871
joint pain.
He thinks it's just a fact of life in 

2304
01:51:33,871 --> 01:51:33,871
the joint.

2305
01:51:33,871 --> 01:51:36,010
Pain is an inflammatory process and he's
taking an anti inflammatory,

2306
01:51:36,011 --> 01:51:36,760
which you would think,
oh,

2307
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:38,690
this is probably a win,
but it,

2308
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:43,710
you know,
in the complexity is kind of kind of 

2309
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:43,710
crazy.
But yeah,

2310
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:45,980
and interestingly it seems to be gut 
bacteria mediated.

2311
01:51:46,780 --> 01:51:51,780
Now what,
like when a person does have some sort 

2312
01:51:51,780 --> 01:51:54,601
of an issue,
like a headache or some sort of a 

2313
01:51:54,601 --> 01:51:54,601
swollen joint or some,
some pain,

2314
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:58,180
is there anything that you can take that
has anti inflammatory properties?

2315
01:51:58,181 --> 01:52:00,070
It doesn't have the negative health 
consequences,

2316
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:01,360
you know.
And for me,

2317
01:52:01,361 --> 01:52:02,560
this is my,
my own,

2318
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:05,620
I'll maybe give you some of my own 
triage with this stuff.

2319
01:52:05,621 --> 01:52:10,621
Like I had an l four l five disc injury 
about 15 years ago doing crossfit at 

2320
01:52:10,621 --> 01:52:13,090
crossfit hq of all places.
It was pretty,

2321
01:52:13,091 --> 01:52:14,830
pretty catastrophic.
But um,

2322
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:17,530
uh,
what was the disc bulging with?

2323
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:21,490
So the first workout was 75 glute ham 
sit ups,

2324
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,070
which you know,
you're on like a glute ham developer and

2325
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,230
you're doing a super long range of 
movement sit up.

2326
01:52:26,770 --> 01:52:31,180
And I ended up with abdo.
Like basically my stomach was inflamed.

2327
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:34,810
It was inflamed for like 12 days.
It was about 13 days later.

2328
01:52:34,811 --> 01:52:39,811
We're pulling abdo abdo instead of 
rhabdo like the rhabdomyolysis maya 

2329
01:52:39,811 --> 01:52:44,250
licenses.
When you overtrain your body literally 

2330
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:46,490
starts breaking down your muscle tissues
and you had pick up your kidneys and you

2331
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:47,550
can die.
Yeah,

2332
01:52:47,570 --> 01:52:50,450
so I had kind of a compartmental 
syndrome with this.

2333
01:52:50,451 --> 01:52:52,880
It was just in the abs,
but it was bad.

2334
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:56,480
So my app is just overworked.
Your abs massively overworked.

2335
01:52:56,481 --> 01:53:01,481
I mean there was no up no ramp up.
This is the first time I've seen this 

2336
01:53:01,481 --> 01:53:01,640
movement and I did 75.
Yeah,

2337
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:04,850
it was ridiculous.
So I'm 12.

2338
01:53:04,851 --> 01:53:07,580
Thirteen days later we were supposed to 
pull max dead lifts.

2339
01:53:07,581 --> 01:53:11,870
My abs were still not healed and I'd 
like for 65 on the bar.

2340
01:53:11,871 --> 01:53:14,630
I was just passing my knees and my abs 
just failed.

2341
01:53:14,990 --> 01:53:17,420
And so I had this like fluxion injury 
with a lot of load.

2342
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:19,100
It,
a very precarious spot.

2343
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:23,090
And I know for l five disc injury,
it's bulging.

2344
01:53:23,091 --> 01:53:25,910
It's not ruptured,
but if I don't mobilize,

2345
01:53:25,911 --> 01:53:27,260
if I sit too much,
if,

2346
01:53:27,290 --> 01:53:30,230
if my hip flexors get tight,
it will get super cranky.

2347
01:53:30,231 --> 01:53:35,231
So I will get to spots,
like if I'm working a lot where I have 

2348
01:53:35,231 --> 01:53:37,670
to take some ibuprofen and all.
So you have this injury still to this,

2349
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:40,040
but yeah,
like it's way better in general,

2350
01:53:40,041 --> 01:53:42,290
but every once in a while I can piss it 
off pretty good.

2351
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,300
Have you ever used a reverse hyper?
Yes.

2352
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:45,620
Yeah.
And it definitely helps.

2353
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,490
Definitely helps.
I mean when I,

2354
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:50,510
when I stay on my mobility maintenance 
cycle,

2355
01:53:50,660 --> 01:53:55,660
I am good to go,
but when I get super busy when I'm 

2356
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:55,660
traveling,
you know,

2357
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:59,951
if I have to sleep in a weird bed or 
something like it's tends to be a 

2358
01:53:59,951 --> 01:54:01,490
cumulative thing to adds up over like 
two weeks.

2359
01:54:01,550 --> 01:54:03,950
And then I can get kind of a back flip 
for people who,

2360
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,960
Uh,
someone just asked about this on twitter

2361
01:54:05,961 --> 01:54:10,961
yesterday,
the reverse hypers and machine created 

2362
01:54:10,961 --> 01:54:13,301
by a guy named louie simmons who is a 
really famous power lifter and a 

2363
01:54:13,491 --> 01:54:16,790
completely insane person who,
if you want to listen to the podcast,

2364
01:54:16,791 --> 01:54:19,790
jamie and I did with him at his place,
west side barbell,

2365
01:54:19,791 --> 01:54:24,791
he's,
he's a fucking nut but genius in making 

2366
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:26,540
this machine that out allows active 
decompression of the spine.

2367
01:54:26,710 --> 01:54:28,220
I'm a big fan of it.
Um,

2368
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:31,640
do you do any sort of spinal 
decompression exercises?

2369
01:54:32,370 --> 01:54:33,170
So both,
uh,

2370
01:54:33,171 --> 01:54:34,020
you know,
kind of the,

2371
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,740
the inversion board and then also just 
um,

2372
01:54:36,741 --> 01:54:38,480
hanging.
I'll actually use some,

2373
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:43,750
you know,
weight lifting straps and go out on a 

2374
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:46,001
pull up bar,
hands together and it'll hang for like 

2375
01:54:46,001 --> 01:54:47,420
three minutes at a shot.
So we'll get to rassic decompression and

2376
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:48,040
then also.

2377
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:49,760
So it's not grip dependent,
right?

2378
01:54:49,910 --> 01:54:51,470
I do thAt,
but I do it with the grip.

2379
01:54:51,471 --> 01:54:56,471
I just,
because I feel like for jujitsu and for 

2380
01:54:56,471 --> 01:54:56,471
all the other things,
I need strong hand.

2381
01:54:56,471 --> 01:54:56,990
So I'll just kill two birds with one 
stone.

2382
01:54:57,030 --> 01:55:02,030
Yeah.
For that I'm on wanting such a training 

2383
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:03,620
stimulus for loosening my thoracic 
girdle and everything that it's gonna.

2384
01:55:03,650 --> 01:55:08,650
It's gonna wipe out my grip.
My grip would fail way before I would 

2385
01:55:08,650 --> 01:55:09,580
get that kind of thoracic opening.
Yeah.

2386
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:13,640
Did you ever think maybe you should work
your grip to grip?

2387
01:55:13,641 --> 01:55:15,130
But I,
I mean we're talking about it.

2388
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:17,900
It's a fairly fat bar also that I have.
Okay.

2389
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:21,350
And so I'm just using that as a little 
bit of a bridge for that,

2390
01:55:21,351 --> 01:55:23,630
but I mean like there's a real benefit 
in having a federal bar,

2391
01:55:23,631 --> 01:55:25,760
right?
Uh,

2392
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:26,650
it,
it,

2393
01:55:26,850 --> 01:55:29,060
it,
you can get strength from here rather as

2394
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,590
strange.
I think again,

2395
01:55:30,591 --> 01:55:31,880
like this variety,
you know,

2396
01:55:31,881 --> 01:55:34,100
like getting as much variety as 
possIble.

2397
01:55:34,101 --> 01:55:37,880
I love rope climbs.
Like if I had one pulling movement I was

2398
01:55:37,881 --> 01:55:42,881
going to use,
it would probably be a rope climb like 

2399
01:55:42,881 --> 01:55:42,881
that.
Interesting.

2400
01:55:42,881 --> 01:55:44,100
Yeah.
And you get this unilateral movement

2401
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:46,050
but you're also like,
you're,

2402
01:55:46,051 --> 01:55:50,820
you get pack involvement.
Lattes are rated the whole thing and and

2403
01:55:50,821 --> 01:55:55,821
as you pull it in it tends to look a lot
like a lot of the positions and the 

2404
01:55:55,821 --> 01:55:58,080
strength in,
In jujitsu and so you also,

2405
01:55:58,081 --> 01:56:00,630
as part of it,
you can work these lock off says as part

2406
01:56:00,631 --> 01:56:05,631
of the the transition.
So for me it just ends up getting more 

2407
01:56:05,631 --> 01:56:07,280
development across my back,
my arms,

2408
01:56:07,300 --> 01:56:11,940
my shoulders in one movement than I 
could get from any other type of polling

2409
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:13,560
activity.
That makes sense.

2410
01:56:13,561 --> 01:56:13,830
Now

2411
01:56:13,910 --> 01:56:18,910
as far as like lower back decompression,
do you ever do that one where you're 

2412
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:21,260
hanging from your waist?
Only from the waist down.

2413
01:56:21,610 --> 01:56:26,610
I love that one.
That one seems to isolate the lower 

2414
01:56:26,610 --> 01:56:29,861
spine.
What is the name of that thing that we 

2415
01:56:29,861 --> 01:56:29,861
have in the back?
Jamie?

2416
01:56:29,861 --> 01:56:32,330
The one that does that one.
Spinal decompression machine that we put

2417
01:56:32,331 --> 01:56:33,920
together back there.
The one with your feet,

2418
01:56:34,010 --> 01:56:34,970
the hangups thing?
No,

2419
01:56:34,971 --> 01:56:39,971
not the hangup one but the other one.
The one that you kinda looks like it 

2420
01:56:39,971 --> 01:56:43,961
looks like a roman setup chair and so,
but it's just for decompression and you 

2421
01:56:44,371 --> 01:56:49,371
just leaned forward and it just,
it seems to target directly the lower 

2422
01:56:49,371 --> 01:56:51,110
back,
much better than just the ankle ones.

2423
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,380
The ones from the ankle,
I feel like my legs are holding a little

2424
01:56:54,381 --> 01:56:58,820
too much and I'm hanging on.
I'm controlling it a little too much.

2425
01:56:58,821 --> 01:56:59,780
Right.
Whereas this one,

2426
01:56:59,781 --> 01:57:01,160
I can completely let go.

2427
01:57:01,210 --> 01:57:02,950
Well in some of the,
the uh,

2428
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:08,390
the gravity boots,
like they were finding that people were 

2429
01:57:08,390 --> 01:57:10,591
getting like laxity and their knees,
like the knees were giving away before 

2430
01:57:10,591 --> 01:57:11,110
you really decompress the back.
THat makes sense.

2431
01:57:11,111 --> 01:57:12,140
Yeah,
that makes sense.

2432
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:12,300
But,

2433
01:57:12,370 --> 01:57:14,020
but also some of that lacks in the 
knees.

2434
01:57:14,021 --> 01:57:16,930
Probably believed some knee pressure on 
some folks as well.

2435
01:57:16,931 --> 01:57:21,931
Sort of like how shoulder hangs releases
a lot of shoulder pain and some people.

2436
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:22,320
Right,
right,

2437
01:57:22,410 --> 01:57:22,950
right.
Yeah,

2438
01:57:22,951 --> 01:57:24,000
totally.
Totally.

2439
01:57:24,150 --> 01:57:27,300
Yeah.
But back to your question about the,

2440
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:28,950
uh,
any inflammatories,

2441
01:57:28,951 --> 01:57:33,951
like if I get a really spicy backflow or
I will do 800 milligrams of ibuprofen,

2442
01:57:34,021 --> 01:57:39,021
but I'll hit it once and then I'm good.
Do you feel any adverse effects because 

2443
01:57:39,021 --> 01:57:40,980
you don't do it a lot,
do you feel like,

2444
01:57:41,180 --> 01:57:43,440
do you take it and then feel any health 
consequences?

2445
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:44,610
I,
I don't,

2446
01:57:44,611 --> 01:57:49,611
but I mean one of the primary health 
consequences as killing over from a 

2447
01:57:49,611 --> 01:57:49,611
heart attack or stroke.
So,

2448
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:54,990
you know,
but it's one of those things where I've 

2449
01:57:54,990 --> 01:57:54,990
played with it and once it gets in that,
you know,

2450
01:57:54,990 --> 01:57:57,810
I can ice it and I can do stem and all 
that stuff helps.

2451
01:57:57,811 --> 01:57:58,830
But it's just like,
man,

2452
01:57:58,831 --> 01:58:03,540
if I can get one targeted bolus of,
of ibuprofen 800 milligrams,

2453
01:58:03,541 --> 01:58:08,160
I hit it once and it just drops it down 
and then,

2454
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:08,690
you know,
I,

2455
01:58:08,691 --> 01:58:13,691
it,
it changes the whole thing from being a 

2456
01:58:13,691 --> 01:58:16,161
two day issue to like a 12 day issue 
because otherwise they'll just kind of 

2457
01:58:16,161 --> 01:58:17,970
drag on and,
and I've just gotten to a point where if

2458
01:58:17,971 --> 01:58:21,280
I really get myself into a bad spot with
my mobility or,

2459
01:58:21,281 --> 01:58:23,340
or just getting this thing pissed off,
then it's like,

2460
01:58:23,370 --> 01:58:24,810
okay,
I've just got to do this.

2461
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:29,240
But then beyond that there's this 
product from a new chapter called ziflow

2462
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:32,820
mend and it's really,
really pretty slick as far as,

2463
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:35,220
uh,
an anti inflammatory.

2464
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:36,900
It pulls,
um,

2465
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:39,240
some ginger extract.
Curcumin,

2466
01:58:39,241 --> 01:58:42,040
they do a super critical extract on

2467
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,800
it and that stuff is pretty legit.
And that can,

2468
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:50,220
for a lot of people,
like I haven't found that it works as 

2469
01:58:50,220 --> 01:58:52,651
well on that pain and inflammation 
reduction when my back gets really 

2470
01:58:52,691 --> 01:58:57,691
spicy.
But it's pretty darn good in everything 

2471
01:58:57,691 --> 01:58:58,210
that's in it.
You could make some arguments.

2472
01:58:58,240 --> 01:59:00,850
It would be pretty beneficial over the 
long haul.

2473
01:59:00,851 --> 01:59:01,650
Like,
it's uh,

2474
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:03,440
uh,
these uh,

2475
01:59:03,610 --> 01:59:04,330
uh,
cox,

2476
01:59:04,331 --> 01:59:06,580
two pathways modifiers,
but they,

2477
01:59:06,650 --> 01:59:09,190
it does it in a different way than what 
the ibuprofen does.

2478
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:10,600
Is it dose dependent?
I mean,

2479
01:59:10,601 --> 01:59:15,601
is there a,
like a point of diminishing returns 

2480
01:59:15,601 --> 01:59:16,600
where you get 800 milligrams is like the
magic number for ibuprofen?

2481
01:59:16,601 --> 01:59:18,110
They say you shouldn't go over that.
Right.

2482
01:59:18,190 --> 01:59:19,870
But is it something like that with this 
stuff?

2483
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:21,700
I don't know.
I don't know,

2484
01:59:21,701 --> 01:59:26,701
like they have a recommended dose on it,
but I haven't really played around with 

2485
01:59:26,701 --> 01:59:30,001
that,
but I mean everything usually has some 

2486
01:59:30,001 --> 01:59:30,001
sort of a,
you know,

2487
01:59:30,001 --> 01:59:30,640
kinetics like dose response curve with 
it.

2488
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:32,260
So I would assume so.
Yeah.

2489
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:33,250
Yeah,
that's what I was wondering.

2490
01:59:33,251 --> 01:59:35,260
I'm like,
what if you took our hyper doses?

2491
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:40,350
I haven't tried that.
I have not tried that because it's all 

2492
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:40,350
natural stuff,
rigHt?

2493
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:44,120
Like,
curcumin is not really dangerous in 

2494
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:44,120
larger doses.
Is it a,

2495
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:47,320
I don't know about the tox toxicology on
that,

2496
01:59:47,321 --> 01:59:47,860
you know,
like,

2497
01:59:47,861 --> 01:59:49,030
um,
uh,

2498
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:56,100
just because it's natural doesn't 
necessarily mean that it's non toxic 

2499
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:56,800
arsenic.
Yeah.

2500
01:59:56,801 --> 01:59:58,270
Yeah.
So that's,

2501
01:59:58,330 --> 01:59:59,900
that's interesting.
Um,

2502
01:59:59,970 --> 02:00:04,970
I w that is an interesting idea.
I haven't really thought about going 

2503
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:05,370
beyond what the recommended is on that.
Yeah,

2504
02:00:05,390 --> 02:00:08,710
I would wonder if that would ramp it up.
Other than that,

2505
02:00:08,711 --> 02:00:10,840
what about aspirin?
Aspirin has some benefit.

2506
02:00:11,140 --> 02:00:12,460
Aspirin has some benefit,
but it's.

2507
02:00:12,480 --> 02:00:17,480
It's kind of an interesting mixed bag 
too late to take enough of it to get a 

2508
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:21,301
really potent effect.
Like you would like if somebody had a 

2509
02:00:21,301 --> 02:00:21,430
back spasm or something like that.

2510
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:24,100
You're looking at the potential of gi 
bleeding.

2511
02:00:24,101 --> 02:00:26,160
You have a really potent blood thinning 
effects,

2512
02:00:26,161 --> 02:00:30,370
so I mean aspirins a little bit dodgy in
in that regard,

2513
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:34,780
that really acute deal that you're.
You're trying to manage,

2514
02:00:34,781 --> 02:00:37,630
but it is a possibly interesting side 
note.

2515
02:00:37,690 --> 02:00:41,890
Aspirin like a baby aspirin a day.
there's some studies that have suggested

2516
02:00:41,891 --> 02:00:44,920
that women taking that baby aspirin a 
day.

2517
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:49,980
It could reduce breast cancer 
potentiality by like 70 percent because 

2518
02:00:49,980 --> 02:00:52,000
of the antiangiogenic effects of the 
aspirin.

2519
02:00:52,630 --> 02:00:57,630
Now I've read some things about the 
ketogenic diet and cancer and that is 

2520
02:00:57,630 --> 02:00:59,890
very fascinating to me about having 
these high fat,

2521
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,150
Low complex carbohydrates,
low simple carbohydrate diets can have a

2522
02:01:04,151 --> 02:01:08,980
great benefit on reducing the fuel that 
cancer needs to stay alive.

2523
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:12,690
It's,
I would say it's at least twofold.

2524
02:01:12,880 --> 02:01:16,330
It's probably multifactorial there,
but so on the one hand,

2525
02:01:16,331 --> 02:01:21,331
certain types of cancer tend to 
preferentially run on glucose and so if 

2526
02:01:21,331 --> 02:01:25,531
you can limit the glucose,
they don't really do well with fats or 

2527
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:28,720
proteins as a fuel source,
so you can limit that.

2528
02:01:28,721 --> 02:01:30,520
Not all cancers falling into this 
category.

2529
02:01:30,521 --> 02:01:35,521
That was some cancers are super 
metabolically flexible and they can use 

2530
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:38,671
just about anything as a fuel source,
so there's a benefit for potentially 

2531
02:01:38,681 --> 02:01:39,620
breast,
colon,

2532
02:01:39,621 --> 02:01:40,430
prostate,

2533
02:01:40,610 --> 02:01:45,610
glioblastoma,
a couple of other endothelial derived 

2534
02:01:45,610 --> 02:01:50,090
cancers that just directly that 
reduction in glucose level may be really

2535
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:55,091
beneficial.
There was another layer to it though 

2536
02:01:55,091 --> 02:01:58,480
that that low glucose environment and 
that shift towards ketosis tends to set 

2537
02:01:59,151 --> 02:02:04,151
up this kind of stress response,
so we actually have a little bit of 

2538
02:02:04,151 --> 02:02:06,380
oxydative stress occurring in the 
mitochondria and normal tissue.

2539
02:02:06,381 --> 02:02:09,350
Do great with that,
but cancerous tissue does not,

2540
02:02:09,380 --> 02:02:13,460
so it's a little bit of an irritant and 
what they're doing right now,

2541
02:02:13,461 --> 02:02:18,461
what they're studying is getting folks 
ramped up on a ketogenic diet so that 

2542
02:02:18,461 --> 02:02:22,211
you get that hormetic stress response.
You're limiting glucose and then they 

2543
02:02:22,211 --> 02:02:24,650
will have people fast immediately before
chemo or radiation.

2544
02:02:24,651 --> 02:02:27,020
so this is still doing some conventional
therapies,

2545
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:30,830
but that fasting state that while you're
also in ketosis,

2546
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:34,340
it reduces your pool of this substance 
called glutathione,

2547
02:02:34,341 --> 02:02:37,190
which is our normal antioxidant defense 
network.

2548
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:39,770
So interestingly,
and maybe counterintuitively,

2549
02:02:39,800 --> 02:02:44,800
they're trying to reduce your 
antioxidant pool and get it down to a 

2550
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,641
bare minimum.
Then when they whack you and the cancer 

2551
02:02:48,641 --> 02:02:52,091
with the chemo and the radiation,
the cancer is more prone to die because 

2552
02:02:52,091 --> 02:02:54,440
it doesn't have antioxidant defense 
mechanisms to keep it going.

2553
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:59,470
So it's a,
it's an interesting thing because a lot 

2554
02:02:59,470 --> 02:02:59,470
of,
uh,

2555
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:01,800
people in the kind of alternative cancer
treatment scene,

2556
02:03:01,801 --> 02:03:06,801
you know,
they'll start dosing people on super 

2557
02:03:06,801 --> 02:03:07,400
high antioxidants with the,
the thought that some of the etiology of

2558
02:03:07,401 --> 02:03:09,640
cancer may be driven by free radicals 
by,

2559
02:03:09,660 --> 02:03:12,740
by oxidative damage.
And there may be some truth to that,

2560
02:03:13,100 --> 02:03:18,100
but it's kinda like the,
the horses out of the barn at this 

2561
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:18,100
point,
they're kind of tackling it in the wrong

2562
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:21,380
way and even when they're using high 
dose vitamin c,

2563
02:03:21,740 --> 02:03:26,740
they're using it intravenously and even 
though vitamin c is touted as an 

2564
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:28,430
antioxidant,
it can be a pro oxidated high substances

2565
02:03:28,431 --> 02:03:30,830
and so are at high concentrations.

2566
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:36,160
So what,
maybe a situation where you get the 

2567
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:39,010
glutathione pool depleted,
you hit these people with high dose 

2568
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:41,990
vitamin c and then they maybe do 
hyperbaric oxygen where they go into a,

2569
02:03:42,050 --> 02:03:44,680
a,
a pressurized canister and they,

2570
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:49,690
they do pure co two and that increases 
the oxidative stress and that may be 

2571
02:03:49,821 --> 02:03:54,821
another adJunctive treatment to this.
But that's all of these different 

2572
02:03:54,821 --> 02:03:57,470
mechanisms that are kind of an outgrowth
of the key to genic diet going on in the

2573
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:58,700
background.
Wow.

2574
02:03:59,130 --> 02:04:04,130
Um,
do you mess around with cryotherapy at 

2575
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:04,130
all?
Not a ton.

2576
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:04,130
I mean,
I,

2577
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:07,910
I live on a little three acre farm and,
and a rino.

2578
02:04:07,911 --> 02:04:11,910
And so it's cold frequently and I have 
like a tub of water and never once while

2579
02:04:11,911 --> 02:04:14,480
when I buy sack up I'll go out there and
sit in it.

2580
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:16,940
But it's so cold water,
it's not like,

2581
02:04:16,941 --> 02:04:18,190
you know,
throw ice in there anything.

2582
02:04:18,410 --> 02:04:23,410
Well,
I mean there's usually for much of the 

2583
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:23,410
year there's a little layer of ice on 
the top of it.

2584
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:25,720
And so I've got to like chisel that out 
and then you climb in and out of climate

2585
02:04:25,740 --> 02:04:27,500
and measure the temperature.
Now,

2586
02:04:27,501 --> 02:04:28,400
I mean it's,
it's,

2587
02:04:28,401 --> 02:04:33,401
uh,
it's somewhere slightly above freezing 

2588
02:04:33,401 --> 02:04:33,401
because,
you know,

2589
02:04:33,401 --> 02:04:34,130
it's got an inch or two of ice on top of
it.

2590
02:04:34,190 --> 02:04:36,770
But after you add rhonda patrick on 
here,

2591
02:04:36,820 --> 02:04:38,070
um,
I kind of opted

2592
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,670
more for the,
a hot sauna kind of deal with this.

2593
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:41,110
I'm like,
dude,

2594
02:04:41,230 --> 02:04:46,230
that's a lot.
That's way easier than it seems really 

2595
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:46,230
positive here.
Yeah.

2596
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:49,461
And I've been doing that after jujitsu 
and on the days when I can pull that 

2597
02:04:49,461 --> 02:04:50,430
off,
my recovery is amazing.

2598
02:04:50,460 --> 02:04:55,460
It's almost like I pressed the reset 
button that day and although I got the 

2599
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:57,810
benefit of jujitsu,
I didn't have any of the downside.

2600
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:03,180
It is crazy and I didn't experience that
when I would do a cryo immersions after 

2601
02:05:03,571 --> 02:05:05,940
exercise.
Like I felt better kind of,

2602
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:08,580
you know,
when the first maybe hour or two after a

2603
02:05:08,581 --> 02:05:12,390
hard workout during the cold water 
immersion,

2604
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:17,100
but then a day or two later like I was 
still sore and joint creaky and all that

2605
02:05:17,101 --> 02:05:20,660
stuff.
Whereas with the sauna you get,

2606
02:05:20,890 --> 02:05:25,890
it's not an infrared sauna,
it's just like this hot as balls sought 

2607
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:28,050
140 degrees plus and I would sit in 
there as long as I could 15,

2608
02:05:28,051 --> 02:05:33,051
20 minutes and man,
wHen when I finally break and I want 

2609
02:05:33,051 --> 02:05:36,891
out,
it's like if there was an old person in 

2610
02:05:36,891 --> 02:05:38,120
front of me getting out of there,
I would push them to panic.

2611
02:05:38,220 --> 02:05:39,400
Getting out of there.
Yeah,

2612
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:44,780
no.
Is there a differentiation in your body 

2613
02:05:44,780 --> 02:05:47,931
between a steam shower and a sauna?
Like when you get into one of those hot 

2614
02:05:48,001 --> 02:05:52,090
steam showers and it's 135 degrees and 
your data,

2615
02:05:52,190 --> 02:05:54,140
is it good because it's heat response,
right?

2616
02:05:54,170 --> 02:05:56,700
That's really what's going to spawn heat
shock proteins.

2617
02:05:56,730 --> 02:05:58,250
Yeah,
I know it did.

2618
02:05:58,590 --> 02:06:01,720
Rhonda patrick would know that one.
I do not know it.

2619
02:06:01,721 --> 02:06:06,721
It seems like for me that air can be 
hotter in.

2620
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:12,080
It's interesting though because water 
can confers or,

2621
02:06:12,091 --> 02:06:16,080
or removes a heat like 30 times faster 
than air does.

2622
02:06:16,140 --> 02:06:17,190
So like uh,
you know,

2623
02:06:17,191 --> 02:06:22,191
so um,
you could heat or cool the Body much 

2624
02:06:22,191 --> 02:06:22,191
faster with water then you came with 
eric clearly.

2625
02:06:22,191 --> 02:06:23,910
And so I'm wondering,
you know,

2626
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:28,940
would you need water that's as hot as 
the air to get the same type of 

2627
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:32,490
temperature elevation in your body or is
just the skin being exposed,

2628
02:06:32,580 --> 02:06:35,640
exposed to air temperature and it's like
an oven.

2629
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:40,670
Is that,
is there something kind of cool with 

2630
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:40,670
that?
Like I,

2631
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:40,770
I don't know,
that's a good question for that one too,

2632
02:06:40,771 --> 02:06:41,480
rhonda.
Yeah,

2633
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,080
I'll make a note of that.
Yeah.

2634
02:06:43,081 --> 02:06:44,010
Um,
what about,

2635
02:06:44,011 --> 02:06:47,500
uh,
other forms of recovery post workout and

2636
02:06:47,530 --> 02:06:52,530
found anything to be beneficial?
Are you messing around at all with like 

2637
02:06:52,530 --> 02:06:54,390
those hard balls?
Like those wad balls?

2638
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:56,520
I do some stuff like that.
Like I,

2639
02:06:56,580 --> 02:07:01,580
so I followed this gymnastics bodies 
program that I wanted to ask you about 

2640
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:01,580
that.
Yeah.

2641
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:05,210
And it's really good and they have so 
they have the strength work as part of 

2642
02:07:05,281 --> 02:07:08,550
this whole thing pressing and pulling 
all kinds of trunk work and everything.

2643
02:07:08,551 --> 02:07:12,480
But each strength movement has a 
mobility movement paired with it.

2644
02:07:12,780 --> 02:07:17,780
So it's,
it's really interesting because as you 

2645
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:20,211
get stronger doing this stuff,
there's a tendency to get tighter so 

2646
02:07:20,211 --> 02:07:22,410
they just kind of bake the mobility 
movement into the cake with that.

2647
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:27,860
But then they also have a three day a 
week stretching sequence once the front 

2648
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:27,860
splits,
once the side splits.

2649
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:30,960
And then the other one is thoracic 
mobility for like a back bend.

2650
02:07:31,140 --> 02:07:36,140
And so I just kind of punch the time 
clock on that like each day have some 

2651
02:07:36,140 --> 02:07:38,620
strength and mobility work that I do 
with that three days a week.

2652
02:07:38,621 --> 02:07:42,130
I do the um,
the dedicated stretching sequence,

2653
02:07:42,131 --> 02:07:47,131
I tend to do it with my daughters,
they're like three and five and so we 

2654
02:07:47,131 --> 02:07:49,510
just get into the floor and you know,
it's just a shit show in there with them

2655
02:07:49,511 --> 02:07:52,450
also,
but it's a ton of fun and we'll hit that

2656
02:07:52,451 --> 02:07:54,370
like three days a week and that's been 
really good.

2657
02:07:54,520 --> 02:07:58,470
I'm a meditation app,
like doing something like brainwave,

2658
02:07:58,610 --> 02:08:03,610
the binaural beats.
I'm so wound tight and kind of type a 

2659
02:08:03,610 --> 02:08:05,770
that if I can just like sit down,
go outside,

2660
02:08:05,830 --> 02:08:08,200
look at the trees,
do five minutes on that thing,

2661
02:08:08,201 --> 02:08:09,790
do some kind of cyclic breathing.

2662
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:12,610
That's amazing for me.
Like that is a really,

2663
02:08:12,611 --> 02:08:16,060
really good system reset for me.
have you done any isolation tank work?

2664
02:08:16,120 --> 02:08:18,850
I have done some isolation take away.
We tried to get me,

2665
02:08:18,851 --> 02:08:23,851
uh,
to go out to torrance last time when I 

2666
02:08:23,851 --> 02:08:24,190
was here and I couldn't make it happen.
I've done that since I've done that.

2667
02:08:24,220 --> 02:08:29,220
Yeah.
So tell me what you've been doing and 

2668
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:29,220
how often.
I don't do it often.

2669
02:08:29,220 --> 02:08:31,780
It's usually when I'm traveling,
there is a place in reno now,

2670
02:08:31,781 --> 02:08:35,190
like it's just kind of getting into reno
and all over the country now.

2671
02:08:35,370 --> 02:08:38,080
it is amazing.
I had a guy apprOached me with a,

2672
02:08:38,081 --> 02:08:39,610
a,
an idea for a,

2673
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:43,420
a pretty legit business model around 
this and we were kind of looking at some

2674
02:08:43,421 --> 02:08:46,700
people putting some money into it and 
then I heard that massage envy was going

2675
02:08:46,701 --> 02:08:48,180
to open up a,
uh,

2676
02:08:48,810 --> 02:08:51,580
you know,
the float tanks and they're everywhere.

2677
02:08:51,580 --> 02:08:53,710
Like there's massage envy on like every 
corner.

2678
02:08:53,711 --> 02:08:54,400
And so I was like,
okay,

2679
02:08:54,570 --> 02:08:57,400
data that backed out of that because you
didn't think that it would be profitable

2680
02:08:57,401 --> 02:09:00,980
that way.
I thought it'd be really easy to get out

2681
02:09:00,981 --> 02:09:04,180
maneuvered by a multi offering,
kind of kind of,

2682
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,010
you know.
But that makes sense.

2683
02:09:06,011 --> 02:09:08,500
Yeah.
Massage and float all in one location.

2684
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:13,840
And if they sell weed to float tanks,
plus weed is like the greatest thing in 

2685
02:09:14,441 --> 02:09:16,360
the world for relaxation,
right?

2686
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:17,590
Yeah.
Yup.

2687
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:22,600
In reno now load Nevada is now.
Remember on board with that Nevada.

2688
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:27,870
Yeah.
The longest time to vita was one of the 

2689
02:09:27,870 --> 02:09:27,870
strictest places in the world.
You if you got caught with a joint,

2690
02:09:27,870 --> 02:09:29,290
you went to jail for something like 
seven years.

2691
02:09:29,291 --> 02:09:30,330
It was really crazy.
It,

2692
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:34,480
it's a interesting environment because 
you have like brothels around there,

2693
02:09:34,481 --> 02:09:39,481
you have the gambling,
but then there was this pretty like 

2694
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:39,481
draconian approach to uh,
you know,

2695
02:09:39,481 --> 02:09:43,910
like really minor drug offenses that 
they should be offensive at all is.

2696
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:46,000
Yeah,
it's pretty ridiculous.

2697
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:51,030
now,
have you messed around at all with cbd 

2698
02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:53,101
oil or cbd,
which is non psychoactive but has 

2699
02:09:53,101 --> 02:09:53,880
tremendous beneficial properties for 
anti-inflammation?

2700
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:59,040
I have not.
And it's one of those things that's on 

2701
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,040
the list to do.
Yeah.

2702
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,590
Yeah.
Get on that.

2703
02:09:59,620 --> 02:10:04,620
Because you would think that with 
someone when I was asking you about a 

2704
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:07,860
anti-inflammation,
things like cbd apparently has profound 

2705
02:10:07,860 --> 02:10:08,020
effects.
You know,

2706
02:10:08,021 --> 02:10:13,021
what's interesting about cbd is that 
everything that you would think is good 

2707
02:10:13,021 --> 02:10:16,180
about kind of a paleo ketogenic diet,
sleeping well,

2708
02:10:16,181 --> 02:10:17,410
exercising,
right?

2709
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:23,130
Cbd does it effectively.
Now it doesn't work the sAme in every 

2710
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:24,640
single person and you need to kind of 
play around with that.

2711
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:29,641
So there's some caveats with it,
but when you just look at the 

2712
02:10:29,641 --> 02:10:32,671
pharmacology,
you look at the research on it and you 

2713
02:10:32,671 --> 02:10:33,130
look at all this other cool stuff that's
been done,

2714
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:34,130
you know,
by,

2715
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:38,690
by dietary interventions elsewhere in 
lifestyle interventions.

2716
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:42,080
Then the cbd oil hits all of those,
those pieces.

2717
02:10:42,081 --> 02:10:44,990
So yeah,
it's kind of amazing that that plant was

2718
02:10:44,991 --> 02:10:49,991
illegal for so long and still isn't a 
lot of places and still it's federally 

2719
02:10:49,991 --> 02:10:53,201
and there's so many benefits to it in a 
non psychoactive benefits folks doesn't 

2720
02:10:53,201 --> 02:10:54,790
have anything to do with your mind.
You know,

2721
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,710
you just want an excuse to goodheart,
hard fucking loser.

2722
02:10:58,010 --> 02:11:01,040
That really doesn't even get you high.
Cbd is don't do a damn thing.

2723
02:11:01,041 --> 02:11:04,220
It does apparently alleviate anxiety and
some breaks,

2724
02:11:04,490 --> 02:11:05,720
right?
Yeah.

2725
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:11,280
How much oF that is anxiety is dependent
or caused by inflammation?

2726
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:17,320
They just had some great studies that 
we're looking at a alterations in gut 

2727
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:20,990
microbiome and inflammatory status and 
depression and anxiety.

2728
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:26,080
And it was basically if they shifted 
things such that the gut microbiome 

2729
02:11:26,080 --> 02:11:29,381
looked healthier,
the depression anxiety basically 

2730
02:11:29,381 --> 02:11:29,381
disappeared and then,
you know,

2731
02:11:29,381 --> 02:11:29,720
it could shift the other way.

2732
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,660
And it's interesting again where if you 
add something,

2733
02:11:33,020 --> 02:11:35,220
so not everybody's going to change her 
diet and,

2734
02:11:35,221 --> 02:11:37,970
and like I advocate for that and push 
and shove,

2735
02:11:37,971 --> 02:11:42,971
but the reality is like our world,
it's sent up and incentivized to not do 

2736
02:11:42,971 --> 02:11:47,951
that.
Like the big junk food manufacturers 

2737
02:11:47,951 --> 02:11:48,410
they study how to make this stuff 
addictive.

2738
02:11:48,411 --> 02:11:51,770
Like what's the laY's potato chip line,
but you can't eat just one.

2739
02:11:51,771 --> 02:11:52,250
You know?
I was like,

2740
02:11:52,251 --> 02:11:57,251
I'll take that thing to the bank all day
long so you can ridicule people fat,

2741
02:11:57,801 --> 02:11:58,790
shame,
do all this stuff.

2742
02:11:58,791 --> 02:12:03,791
But there's a reality that our modern 
world is set up to work exactly against 

2743
02:12:03,791 --> 02:12:05,930
our genetics.
So what do we do then?

2744
02:12:05,931 --> 02:12:10,931
Well,
you could have something like cbd oil 

2745
02:12:10,931 --> 02:12:12,911
where you put it in a little bite of 
chocolate and the person has one or two 

2746
02:12:12,911 --> 02:12:16,601
times a day or whatever the dosing 
regimen is and maybe it puts their all 

2747
02:12:16,601 --> 02:12:16,940
sort of colitis and remission.

2748
02:12:16,940 --> 02:12:21,940
Maybe their depression is gone.
And then maybe if we get them moving in 

2749
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:22,850
a good direction and they don't feel 
like shit,

2750
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:24,350
then maybe we can say,
okay,

2751
02:12:24,351 --> 02:12:26,330
let's now get some diet changes in 
there.

2752
02:12:26,331 --> 02:12:28,350
Let's get you going to bed earlier.
If you are gonna,

2753
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:33,370
stay up and work.
Put on some blue blockers so it doesn't 

2754
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:34,880
mess with your sleep patterns as much,
but it's a really accessible,

2755
02:12:34,940 --> 02:12:39,940
inexpensive,
a no risk proposition that could have 

2756
02:12:39,940 --> 02:12:41,480
some really huge benefits for people.
Yeah.

2757
02:12:41,481 --> 02:12:46,481
I think that what you said too,
that this system is sort of set up to 

2758
02:12:46,481 --> 02:12:50,021
get people to eat these crappy foods and
make them incredibly available and very 

2759
02:12:50,021 --> 02:12:53,180
difficult to pass up.
And once you start eating them,

2760
02:12:53,181 --> 02:12:55,850
you consume on a daily basis.
Your body starts craving them.

2761
02:12:55,851 --> 02:13:00,851
You get addicted to them.
I was at the supermarket the other day 

2762
02:13:00,851 --> 02:13:02,720
and I was under the influence and I was 
always wandering through the aisles.

2763
02:13:02,720 --> 02:13:05,270
It was one of those weird moments where 
I went,

2764
02:13:05,271 --> 02:13:10,271
is this always been like this?
I was just looking at these cans of 

2765
02:13:10,271 --> 02:13:10,680
food.
Everything's can write.

2766
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:15,690
And I was thinking this is all food,
but it can last forever and like is not 

2767
02:13:15,690 --> 02:13:17,960
supposed to last forever.
The whole idea is supposed to grow it.

2768
02:13:17,990 --> 02:13:19,550
You take it out of the ground,
it's alive,

2769
02:13:19,551 --> 02:13:23,090
you eat it and then you're healthy.
And then I was looking at this food that

2770
02:13:23,091 --> 02:13:28,091
was like just filled with preservatives 
and canned and these packages and 

2771
02:13:28,311 --> 02:13:29,810
plastic bags of it.
And I was like,

2772
02:13:30,230 --> 02:13:32,370
this is so.
It's so strange

2773
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:35,490
that this is the prevalent food because 
it's so easy to store.

2774
02:13:35,491 --> 02:13:38,130
It's so easy to ship.
It's so easy to have for sale.

2775
02:13:38,131 --> 02:13:40,320
You put a barcode on the package and 
you're good to go.

2776
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:44,670
But this is not really.
I mean you can eat it,

2777
02:13:44,730 --> 02:13:46,320
it's food kind of.
Right?

2778
02:13:46,321 --> 02:13:49,770
But it's not really food food.
The real food is on the edges.

2779
02:13:50,150 --> 02:13:55,150
The real food is where the vegetables 
are and where the meats are and where 

2780
02:13:55,150 --> 02:13:55,590
the eggs are.
That stuff in the middle.

2781
02:13:55,591 --> 02:13:58,770
And those aisles where he just sees 
bright colored cans,

2782
02:13:59,050 --> 02:14:00,270
they would.
It was so weird.

2783
02:14:00,271 --> 02:14:02,700
It was like a little kid's toy store,
right?

2784
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:03,570
Like,
because I was high.

2785
02:14:03,571 --> 02:14:08,571
So I was wandering through the aisle and
I'm looking at all these different 

2786
02:14:08,571 --> 02:14:08,571
colors on it.
This is so weird.

2787
02:14:08,571 --> 02:14:13,191
It's like trying to draw me in with 
smiley faces on the cans and on the 

2788
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:15,670
plastic bags.
But it's,

2789
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:21,100
we,
unless you're going to a really good 

2790
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:24,231
natural food store,
you're probably inundated with that 

2791
02:14:24,231 --> 02:14:28,251
stuff.
If you go to the regular vons and just 

2792
02:14:28,251 --> 02:14:28,251
walked down the aisle,
man,

2793
02:14:28,251 --> 02:14:30,060
you're going to get hit with so much of 
this shit.

2794
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:30,840
Right?
And it,

2795
02:14:30,841 --> 02:14:35,841
it's um,
it's interesting because the folks that 

2796
02:14:35,841 --> 02:14:38,580
make these foods,
they study neurophysiology,

2797
02:14:38,581 --> 02:14:42,330
they study evolutionary biology,
they study how to make things addictive.

2798
02:14:42,331 --> 02:14:43,950
So it's,
it's kind of funny.

2799
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:45,810
On the one hand were like the 
gatekeepers,

2800
02:14:45,811 --> 02:14:48,720
the medical establishment.
A lot of the media,

2801
02:14:48,721 --> 02:14:52,120
if you talk about like this ancestral 
health template or what have you there,

2802
02:14:52,121 --> 02:14:55,050
there's still a bunch of like pissing 
match and contention around that.

2803
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:57,810
Whereas the people who are making these 
foods addictive,

2804
02:14:57,811 --> 02:15:02,811
they fully get it,
but they're using it in such a way that 

2805
02:15:02,811 --> 02:15:02,811
they're like,
okay,

2806
02:15:02,811 --> 02:15:04,380
here's our predilection to eat more and 
move less.

2807
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:09,620
Here's how we're going to make that 
happen and we have these really 

2808
02:15:09,620 --> 02:15:11,070
interesting flavor combinations and 
different experiences and do,

2809
02:15:11,330 --> 02:15:13,180
do you want to,
do you want to run that,

2810
02:15:13,280 --> 02:15:18,280
that video.
So here's a really interesting example 

2811
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:18,280
of this,
um,

2812
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:18,510
where,
you know,

2813
02:15:18,540 --> 02:15:21,990
you could get bored of even a really 
tasty food,

2814
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:25,770
but then you can figure out a way to 
bypass this whole process.

2815
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:36,800
Strategy works for now.
And I resumed my epic ice cream.

2816
02:15:38,550 --> 02:15:39,300
Okay.
So what,

2817
02:15:39,301 --> 02:15:41,700
what's going on there?
Is it Andrew Zimmerman?

2818
02:15:41,701 --> 02:15:42,570
Uh,
or no?

2819
02:15:42,571 --> 02:15:45,420
Adam.
Rick manned a man versus food he does.

2820
02:15:45,421 --> 02:15:50,100
He's eating challenges and he's in this 
thing called the kitchen sink challenge.

2821
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:54,040
It's an eight pound ice cream sundae and
I think anybody would,

2822
02:15:54,090 --> 02:15:57,300
would say that an ice cream sundae is 
pretty tasty,

2823
02:15:57,480 --> 02:16:02,480
you know,
and it's hyper palatable like it would 

2824
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:04,671
make you want to eat it.
But what happens to him is he gets 

2825
02:16:04,671 --> 02:16:07,551
completely bogged down in this process 
and can't go on until he orders a plate 

2826
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:10,800
of extra salty,
extra crunchy french fries.

2827
02:16:11,160 --> 02:16:13,770
So he's actually gagging on the ice 
cream.

2828
02:16:13,771 --> 02:16:16,740
Can't go on,
he's not going to win this thing and the

2829
02:16:16,741 --> 02:16:21,210
way that he gets out of this situation 
is by eating more food.

2830
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:26,660
He would not have finished the sunday 
were it not for eating the french fries 

2831
02:16:27,130 --> 02:16:32,130
and so you have this situation where in 
are woven into our genetics is this 

2832
02:16:32,130 --> 02:16:37,081
process called palate fatigue where even
if we have a really tasty food in front 

2833
02:16:37,081 --> 02:16:40,861
of us we will get bored of it and then 
we'll want something else and if you 

2834
02:16:40,861 --> 02:16:45,331
have that other thing that something 
else immediately available and it's 

2835
02:16:45,331 --> 02:16:46,900
different enough from the thing that you
just got bored with,

2836
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:50,320
you can eat more in total and it's just 
so interesting.

2837
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:53,380
Like he would have failed eating this 
ice cream sundae.

2838
02:16:53,410 --> 02:16:57,040
We're just the sunday,
but not only did he eat the sunday,

2839
02:16:57,041 --> 02:17:00,250
he ate probably about 1500 calories of 
extra salty,

2840
02:17:00,251 --> 02:17:03,070
extra crunchy french fries.
How did he know that?

2841
02:17:03,071 --> 02:17:04,120
Soon?
Explained that to them.

2842
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:07,510
So if you go to professional eating 
websites,

2843
02:17:07,511 --> 02:17:12,020
like people who go do these things where
they like eat hot dogs and whatever.

2844
02:17:12,150 --> 02:17:13,180
Yeah,
competitive eater.

2845
02:17:13,570 --> 02:17:15,520
There are pairings.
So it's like,

2846
02:17:15,521 --> 02:17:17,770
okay,
so with hot dogs you need something like

2847
02:17:17,771 --> 02:17:21,550
gummy bears because the hot dogs are 
salty and media new mommy,

2848
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:24,700
so you need something kind of sweet and 
fruity and light.

2849
02:17:25,150 --> 02:17:27,490
And so there are all these pairings that
you do.

2850
02:17:27,491 --> 02:17:30,670
And so with ice cream,
because it's cold,

2851
02:17:30,820 --> 02:17:32,290
creamy,
sweet,

2852
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:35,440
the perfect compliment to it is this 
salty,

2853
02:17:35,470 --> 02:17:37,810
crunchy umami that you get out of the,
uh,

2854
02:17:37,811 --> 02:17:40,150
the french fries.
That's fascinating.

2855
02:17:40,510 --> 02:17:42,430
You know,
I've always found that if I'm eating,

2856
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:44,290
I'm eating something and it's really 
good,

2857
02:17:44,291 --> 02:17:46,330
like a steak or something.
And um,

2858
02:17:46,750 --> 02:17:51,750
I,
I'm stuffed even if I don't want any 

2859
02:17:51,750 --> 02:17:54,551
more of the steak.
If I have fries and I taste those salty 

2860
02:17:54,551 --> 02:17:54,551
fries,
I'll start eating more fries.

2861
02:17:54,551 --> 02:17:55,750
Like I know I'm full,
right?

2862
02:17:55,760 --> 02:17:58,120
Am I stuffing my fat face with these 
stupid fries?

2863
02:17:58,150 --> 02:17:59,650
It's,
it's that novelty.

2864
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:01,780
And from an evolutionary biology 
perspective,

2865
02:18:01,781 --> 02:18:05,350
it's great wiring.
It's great engineering because we didn't

2866
02:18:05,351 --> 02:18:07,510
have guaranteed food all the time.
You know,

2867
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:10,030
like you had to eat when you could get 
it and then,

2868
02:18:10,031 --> 02:18:15,031
you know,
you might go a long period of time 

2869
02:18:15,031 --> 02:18:17,101
without having that food.
But now we're in a situation where you 

2870
02:18:17,101 --> 02:18:17,800
have infinite variety,
there's 50,000

2871
02:18:17,801 --> 02:18:22,120
different food items in an average 
supermarket is 10 or 11,000

2872
02:18:22,121 --> 02:18:24,610
new food type items that are released 
each year.

2873
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:29,910
They're engineered to be hyper palatable
to bypass the neuro regulation of 

2874
02:18:29,910 --> 02:18:33,151
appetite and it's super easy to just go 
fill up your pantry with a wide 

2875
02:18:33,151 --> 02:18:34,630
assortment of these things.
So then you can do what,

2876
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,780
what he ended up doing here.
You can eat one meal,

2877
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:38,830
you know,
like man,

2878
02:18:38,831 --> 02:18:40,630
a little sweet thing would be really 
good.

2879
02:18:40,660 --> 02:18:42,820
So you have that sweet thing and then,
gosh,

2880
02:18:42,821 --> 02:18:45,550
a little salty crunchy would be nice.
And so you have the salty,

2881
02:18:45,551 --> 02:18:48,940
crunchy and you can just keep eating 
through this whole process.

2882
02:18:48,941 --> 02:18:53,941
And it really makes most of the standard
like dietetics recommendation of,

2883
02:18:54,281 --> 02:18:55,240
you know,
eat less,

2884
02:18:55,241 --> 02:18:57,010
move more,
everything in moderation.

2885
02:18:57,520 --> 02:18:59,740
There's no moderation in that 
environment.

2886
02:19:00,210 --> 02:19:03,670
It doesn't exist.
It's a hookers and cocaine experience,

2887
02:19:03,671 --> 02:19:04,180
you know,
I mean,

2888
02:19:04,190 --> 02:19:07,510
it's like these things spin the dopamine
centers in the brain,

2889
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:09,970
they are addictive and,
and,

2890
02:19:09,971 --> 02:19:14,971
uh,
and if we are surprised by that process 

2891
02:19:14,971 --> 02:19:17,140
at all or feel bad about it,
it's kind of crazy.

2892
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:22,140
Like it is not your fault if you find 
yourself in trapped in this world of 

2893
02:19:22,481 --> 02:19:27,481
hyper palatable foods.
And I don't suggest that people just 

2894
02:19:27,481 --> 02:19:29,270
roll over and expose her belly to the 
world and let you know,

2895
02:19:29,271 --> 02:19:31,760
let the world have its way with you.
But understand what,

2896
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:32,870
what,
why it's so difficult.

2897
02:19:33,060 --> 02:19:35,990
Like you should not feel guilt.
There shouldn't be any drama.

2898
02:19:35,991 --> 02:19:40,991
There should be no morality around it.
Like if we just understand this is your 

2899
02:19:40,991 --> 02:19:43,850
basic biological wiring and if you 
understand that and it's not your fault,

2900
02:19:43,851 --> 02:19:48,851
but let's do something,
then we can at least decouple ourselves 

2901
02:19:48,851 --> 02:19:51,110
from the emotionality and the drama and 
the guilt that we've had around this.

2902
02:19:51,111 --> 02:19:54,920
And we can start making some changes.
But so many times,

2903
02:19:55,090 --> 02:19:59,660
the reason why I've heard from people 
that they peel out of some sort of a new

2904
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:03,380
way of eating or lifestyle is it they're
motoring long.

2905
02:20:03,380 --> 02:20:05,060
They seem to be doing well and then 
they're like,

2906
02:20:05,130 --> 02:20:10,130
the,
they're just gone and then you talk to 

2907
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:10,130
them and they're like,
oh,

2908
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:10,130
it's just hard.
It's like,

2909
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:10,130
yeah,
it is hard.

2910
02:20:10,130 --> 02:20:11,810
But it wasn't just that,
it was hard.

2911
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,930
They usually start getting some sort of 
internal dialogue where,

2912
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:15,980
well,
I suck.

2913
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:18,050
I must be weak.
I can't do it.

2914
02:20:18,110 --> 02:20:20,360
It's easier for that guy than it is for 
me.

2915
02:20:20,750 --> 02:20:22,550
So they bail on it.
And when I,

2916
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:27,580
when I started putting this kind of spin
of this evolutionary biology and this 

2917
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:30,110
neuro regulation of appetite into 
working with people,

2918
02:20:30,500 --> 02:20:35,500
particularly people who had had 
difficulties with eating over the long 

2919
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:35,500
haul and maybe like some,
you know,

2920
02:20:35,500 --> 02:20:37,610
we're relationships with food or what 
have you.

2921
02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:39,800
There was like this light that went on 
there.

2922
02:20:39,801 --> 02:20:40,430
Like,
okay,

2923
02:20:40,431 --> 02:20:41,450
so it's not my fault.
I'm like,

2924
02:20:41,451 --> 02:20:42,470
no man,
it's not your fault.

2925
02:20:42,470 --> 02:20:45,890
We still need to do something and it's 
not necessarily going to be easy,

2926
02:20:46,190 --> 02:20:51,190
but we can do this and if you aren't 
beating yourself up about the fact that 

2927
02:20:51,190 --> 02:20:53,210
this thing is a difficult process,
then we're going to be able to get a lot

2928
02:20:53,211 --> 02:20:58,211
further down the road.
Are there any foods that when you do go 

2929
02:20:58,211 --> 02:20:59,480
off the rails,
like say if you have a cheat day and you

2930
02:20:59,481 --> 02:21:00,500
have a,
oh my god man,

2931
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:03,830
eat a whole pizza and a bowl of 
spaghetti and some fucking ice cream.

2932
02:21:04,130 --> 02:21:09,130
Is there any foods that can counter 
balance the damaging effects or the 

2933
02:21:09,380 --> 02:21:14,380
addictive properties?
Because the worst thing you want to do 

2934
02:21:14,380 --> 02:21:14,380
is have a cheat day and go,
oh,

2935
02:21:14,380 --> 02:21:16,750
fuck it.
I'm just going to be a slob right now to

2936
02:21:16,890 --> 02:21:18,260
enjoy a cheat day.
By the way,

2937
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:19,070
you know,
it's,

2938
02:21:19,071 --> 02:21:20,360
um,
don't,

2939
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:22,960
you know,
and I,

2940
02:21:23,090 --> 02:21:23,780
I,
um,

2941
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:26,930
so instead of calling it a cheat day,
I usually just say,

2942
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:28,880
kick your heels up to whatever you want 
to do.

2943
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:32,060
I've seen a little problem when people 
set it up and they're like,

2944
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:33,680
okay,
saturdays are my cheat days.

2945
02:21:33,681 --> 02:21:35,390
And then you start gearing up towards 
saturday,

2946
02:21:35,391 --> 02:21:40,391
it's like a heroin user who get the box 
out and they flip it open and they're 

2947
02:21:40,391 --> 02:21:44,981
getting all their gear setup and that 
anticipatory process for most of these 

2948
02:21:44,981 --> 02:21:49,661
people is better than actually having 
the thing and that anticipatory process 

2949
02:21:49,661 --> 02:21:51,270
is getting the dopamine,
you know,

2950
02:21:51,271 --> 02:21:54,020
go on in the brain and it just gets you 
all wound up and do it.

2951
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:56,100
So ideally,
you know,

2952
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:58,670
let's say people eat three days,
three meals a day,

2953
02:21:58,671 --> 02:22:00,410
seven days a week,
it's 21 meals,

2954
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:04,420
let's just say 19 of those meals are 
pretty on point and two of them are kind

2955
02:22:04,421 --> 02:22:07,610
of kick your heels up to whatever and do
it whenever you want to do it.

2956
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:13,210
The caveat to that is are there things 
that are going to flip you out and 

2957
02:22:13,941 --> 02:22:16,010
you're not going to come back from it,
you know?

2958
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:20,690
And it depends if it's really an 
individual thing.

2959
02:22:20,691 --> 02:22:23,080
So it could be a heroine food out there 
as well.

2960
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:25,980
So my heroine food is a

2961
02:22:26,550 --> 02:22:29,250
sea salt and vinegar potato chips.
Oh I love those.

2962
02:22:29,251 --> 02:22:34,251
Yeah.
Like kind of healthy though is vinegar 

2963
02:22:34,251 --> 02:22:34,251
is potatoes.
Potatoes,

2964
02:22:34,251 --> 02:22:35,850
salt,
what's bad about them?

2965
02:22:36,480 --> 02:22:41,480
Well,
when you eat like a five pound bag of 

2966
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:41,480
them,
which I can do in the blink of an eye.

2967
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:43,420
Then how big is a five pound bag of 
potato chips are pretty goddamn.

2968
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:48,330
Lots of leaf seizures,
but that would be a big site bag.

2969
02:22:48,331 --> 02:22:48,950
Okay.
Let let,

2970
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:53,990
let's say,
let's say a 16 ounce bag of potato 

2971
02:22:53,990 --> 02:22:53,990
chips,
but 16 ounce bag.

2972
02:22:53,990 --> 02:22:54,930
What kind of a slob or you?
That's crazy.

2973
02:22:54,931 --> 02:22:59,760
That time slot,
you know it's so,

2974
02:22:59,950 --> 02:23:01,470
you know.
Whereas my wife,

2975
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:06,530
she'll eat a little bit of potato chips 
but she's more of a sweets person 

2976
02:23:06,530 --> 02:23:07,440
whereas I'll have a little bit of dark 
chocolate,

2977
02:23:07,441 --> 02:23:12,441
but literally a good brick of dark 
chocolate will sit in the cabinet for a 

2978
02:23:12,441 --> 02:23:13,350
month and I'll chip away at it.

2979
02:23:13,350 --> 02:23:14,520
A block here,
a block there.

2980
02:23:14,521 --> 02:23:16,200
But if we have potato chips in the 
house,

2981
02:23:16,201 --> 02:23:21,201
I will eat all of them.
I'm a dark chocolate and peanut butter 

2982
02:23:21,201 --> 02:23:21,201
dude.
Okay.

2983
02:23:21,201 --> 02:23:25,160
Yeah.
Dipped in dark chocolate and peanut 

2984
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:25,160
butter because you know you got your 
chocolate in my peanut butter.

2985
02:23:25,160 --> 02:23:26,520
Remember those commercials and it tastes
delicious.

2986
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:31,940
Guess what?
Reese's peanut butter cups can't fuck 

2987
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:32,540
with an actual candy bar and an actual 
peanut butter.

2988
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:34,050
That's way better.
Right?

2989
02:23:34,240 --> 02:23:35,200
Right.
Fucked up with that.

2990
02:23:35,201 --> 02:23:37,080
It's still a really good idea though.
They shouldn't have.

2991
02:23:37,290 --> 02:23:42,290
They shouldn't have done it.
And that's why they stopped doing that 

2992
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:42,290
commercial because people said 
[inaudible],

2993
02:23:42,290 --> 02:23:46,480
I'm just going buy a chocolate bar and a
big ass tub of peanut butter and have a 

2994
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:46,700
party.
Right.

2995
02:23:46,860 --> 02:23:48,450
It's way better.
It's way better.

2996
02:23:48,540 --> 02:23:49,470
But you know,
in that,

2997
02:23:49,471 --> 02:23:52,950
that's an interesting to like thinking 
about the palatability thing,

2998
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:56,490
how much chocolate can you by itself,
right?

2999
02:23:56,610 --> 02:23:58,470
How much peanut butter can eat by 
itself,

3000
02:23:58,590 --> 02:24:01,020
but together together you can fuck them 
up.

3001
02:24:01,080 --> 02:24:02,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

3002
02:24:02,140 --> 02:24:07,140
In ghirardelli's chocolate,
like one of those big ass thick 

3003
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:07,590
chocolate bars.
Oh right.

3004
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:08,880
And,
and it's,

3005
02:24:08,980 --> 02:24:09,840
you know,
for me,

3006
02:24:09,841 --> 02:24:13,320
I'm not trying to moralize it or say 
this is right or that's wrong,

3007
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:16,590
but just being aware that like stacking 
those flavor combinations,

3008
02:24:16,591 --> 02:24:20,670
like in general,
if you can make your meals enjoyable but

3009
02:24:20,671 --> 02:24:23,790
not over the top to the,
to the point that you're,

3010
02:24:23,820 --> 02:24:24,990
you're,
you're overdoing it.

3011
02:24:25,020 --> 02:24:27,510
And it's just different for everybody.
You know,

3012
02:24:27,511 --> 02:24:29,430
they have,
that sounds like you're saying enjoy it,

3013
02:24:29,431 --> 02:24:31,610
but don't enjoy it too much.
That's pretty much it.

3014
02:24:31,870 --> 02:24:32,660
It,
yeah.

3015
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:34,770
But what about someone who wants to 
enjoy it?

3016
02:24:34,890 --> 02:24:39,890
What about someone who wants to have 
that delicious taste of the sea salt and

3017
02:24:40,471 --> 02:24:45,471
vinegar and the potato chips.
What I recommend is generally you have 

3018
02:24:45,471 --> 02:24:49,821
that out of the house and you don't have
it hanging out in your pantry because 

3019
02:24:49,821 --> 02:24:50,080
you go to the woods.

3020
02:24:50,080 --> 02:24:53,110
Like remember when we used to find porn,
we're porn the woods.

3021
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:56,370
You to bring potato chips in the woods,
eat them in a dangerous environment.

3022
02:24:56,670 --> 02:24:59,100
So you're constantly looking over your 
shoulder for wolves and shit.

3023
02:24:59,180 --> 02:25:01,740
Right.
That's a good strategy.

3024
02:25:01,741 --> 02:25:06,741
I was thinking more just kinda like go 
to the mini mart and you get it in your 

3025
02:25:06,741 --> 02:25:09,441
car.
But yet that god made me feel like a 

3026
02:25:09,441 --> 02:25:11,271
real junk.
And you're in a bad neighborhood 

3027
02:25:11,271 --> 02:25:11,271
shooting up in the parking lot.
Oh yeah.

3028
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:16,280
So for you it's just that that's a.
That seems like a good healthy heroin 

3029
02:25:16,280 --> 02:25:18,600
food though as far as like heroin foods.
I mean it's just a potato,

3030
02:25:18,601 --> 02:25:23,601
a root vegetable.
But I mean you can really track blood 

3031
02:25:23,601 --> 02:25:25,600
sugar on it when you eat a bag of,
you know,

3032
02:25:25,601 --> 02:25:27,820
like the sea salt and vinegar,
potato chips.

3033
02:25:27,821 --> 02:25:30,000
My blood sugar was like diabetic levels.

3034
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:32,490
So yeah,
it's have weird dance.

3035
02:25:32,550 --> 02:25:33,760
Yeah,
I would like to check it.

3036
02:25:33,880 --> 02:25:38,880
Yeah.
That's squared away with a cgm if you 

3037
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:39,460
want to do that.
It's continuous blood glucose monitor.

3038
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:43,030
You put it on and it has it doing it,
doing it through your skin.

3039
02:25:43,130 --> 02:25:48,130
It's a little tiny hair,
hair size probe that goes through the 

3040
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:51,580
skin and then it samples the blood,
the interstitial fluid once a minute for

3041
02:25:51,581 --> 02:25:54,700
the duration that you have this thing on
usually where two or three weeks.

3042
02:25:54,701 --> 02:25:55,580
And.
And uh,

3043
02:25:55,690 --> 02:26:00,690
yeah I was using one of those ketone 
monitors where you have to cut yourself 

3044
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:04,231
and then.
But it doesn't make me bleed because I 

3045
02:26:04,231 --> 02:26:04,231
have too many cows.
His hands.

3046
02:26:04,231 --> 02:26:08,430
So it stick it in the fingers and my,
my fingertip skin is too thick so I'd 

3047
02:26:08,430 --> 02:26:13,261
have to go to the side of my hand.
it's fucking gross to like jab myself 

3048
02:26:13,331 --> 02:26:14,710
and the side and my fingers.

3049
02:26:14,730 --> 02:26:16,150
Right.
They've got annoyed by it.

3050
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:18,970
This is pretty mellow.
I was even able to roll with it.

3051
02:26:18,971 --> 02:26:21,340
I just took some rock tape and put over 
it.

3052
02:26:22,850 --> 02:26:24,000
Yeah,
it's a,

3053
02:26:24,030 --> 02:26:29,030
you know,
like a 50 fifty cent piece kind of deal 

3054
02:26:29,030 --> 02:26:30,130
with low profile,
flat rolled with it on your body.

3055
02:26:30,131 --> 02:26:33,190
What if someone put you in like a bicep 
crusher on that arm?

3056
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:34,990
That would have sucked.
That would have sucked.

3057
02:26:34,991 --> 02:26:39,991
So yeah.
So what we're doing tap out before it 

3058
02:26:39,991 --> 02:26:41,140
gets to that.
That one did not come up during.

3059
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:43,780
Where do you put it?
Usually right there.

3060
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:46,540
It's right where I'd get you look for 
that spot.

3061
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:50,380
I know he's got that thing on and real 
fucking attack that thing.

3062
02:26:50,830 --> 02:26:52,660
That's so funny for me,
man.

3063
02:26:52,661 --> 02:26:55,960
It's linguine with clams.
That's my heroine food.

3064
02:26:56,560 --> 02:27:01,560
I love linguine with clams.
Is there any benefit to having gluten 

3065
02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:03,490
free linguine versus regular linguine?

3066
02:27:03,730 --> 02:27:05,980
Definitely.
If you're reactive to gluten then yeah,

3067
02:27:06,010 --> 02:27:09,910
it seems to me just seems like my body 
processes it a little easier.

3068
02:27:09,930 --> 02:27:14,930
Right.
But it doesn't seem as satisfying 

3069
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:14,930
either.
Hm.

3070
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:19,210
Huh.
And it's been prepped pretty much the 

3071
02:27:19,210 --> 02:27:19,210
same way.
It's just like,

3072
02:27:19,210 --> 02:27:21,740
it's a little less substantial.
There's like,

3073
02:27:21,900 --> 02:27:26,900
there's something about like real in 
gleaning from a good italian restaurant 

3074
02:27:26,900 --> 02:27:28,480
where has that aldente bite to it?
Right.

3075
02:27:28,650 --> 02:27:31,750
Hard to get that with gluten free pasta.
I mean there's a,

3076
02:27:31,751 --> 02:27:35,800
there's a textural element to it.
There's clearly a flavor element to it.

3077
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:39,450
I'm gluten is just really interesting,
like the type of protein that it is,

3078
02:27:39,451 --> 02:27:44,451
it,
this is why it makes pasta and pastries 

3079
02:27:44,451 --> 02:27:47,641
and everything so unique.
Like we don't make pastries out of corn 

3080
02:27:47,641 --> 02:27:50,010
because it sucks as a medium like that 
for tortillas.

3081
02:27:50,011 --> 02:27:55,011
So bad for tortillas,
but You're not going to make like a 

3082
02:27:55,011 --> 02:27:55,011
sandwich out of it.
Yeah.

3083
02:27:55,011 --> 02:27:58,920
Yeah.
So I mean you've got those flavor 

3084
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:01,231
elements and then for some people they 
do get a little bit of an opiate 

3085
02:28:01,231 --> 02:28:02,080
response off of wheat.
So for you,

3086
02:28:02,081 --> 02:28:04,750
you have a tremendous intolerance to 
wheat,

3087
02:28:04,751 --> 02:28:09,751
so you cannot fuck with that.
But for the average person that doesn't 

3088
02:28:09,751 --> 02:28:13,201
have this tremendous intolerance,
is there a benefit to eating sprouted 

3089
02:28:13,201 --> 02:28:15,580
bread over regular bread?
I would say generally,

3090
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:17,160
yes.
Based.

3091
02:28:17,710 --> 02:28:22,710
Not necessarily nutrient,
but potentially this inflammatory 

3092
02:28:22,710 --> 02:28:22,710
process.
Yeah.

3093
02:28:22,710 --> 02:28:22,710
And,

3094
02:28:22,710 --> 02:28:23,570
and again,
the enzymes,

3095
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:25,990
the enzymes break down the gliadins and 
so in,

3096
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:31,030
in part it's just partially digested so 
it's easier to digest and absorb to the 

3097
02:28:32,841 --> 02:28:35,270
degree that there some problems with 
like glee,

3098
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:37,820
addon,
wheat germ agglutinin those proteins get

3099
02:28:37,821 --> 02:28:42,821
broken down.
So I would say that there's a lower 

3100
02:28:42,821 --> 02:28:42,950
likelihood of those foods being 
proinflammatory.

3101
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:44,120
So if somebody's like,
dude,

3102
02:28:44,121 --> 02:28:46,770
I want a sandwich.
Then doing the zika or bread and,

3103
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:51,880
and doing it on that to me would be a 
pretty good wing compared to doing like 

3104
02:28:51,880 --> 02:28:53,690
wonder bread.
Now is there any nutritional properties?

3105
02:28:53,691 --> 02:28:55,310
Are benefits to eating that bread?
Is that,

3106
02:28:55,390 --> 02:28:58,550
is there anything like you could say 
like I'm eating something good.

3107
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:04,060
The fact that it's a whole grain and it 
hasn't been super denuded and process,

3108
02:29:04,281 --> 02:29:06,510
you're gonna have more b vitamins.
You could have more mineral.

3109
02:29:06,511 --> 02:29:09,570
So in general,
like if we were to weigh out equally,

3110
02:29:09,610 --> 02:29:14,610
you know,
say 100 grams of this hundred grams of 

3111
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:14,610
that.

3112
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:14,630
There's gonna be more vitamins,
minerals,

3113
02:29:14,631 --> 02:29:17,360
antioxidants,
and the zucchini bread than in the white

3114
02:29:17,361 --> 02:29:22,361
bread.
Even though the white bread gets 

3115
02:29:22,361 --> 02:29:23,591
enriched with iron and some b vitamins,
I would say that the bread is still 

3116
02:29:23,591 --> 02:29:25,220
probably a win.
I never bought that enriched shit.

3117
02:29:25,280 --> 02:29:26,800
Right.
Rich flower.

3118
02:29:26,810 --> 02:29:28,700
Like why enriching it?
What are you doing?

3119
02:29:28,730 --> 02:29:32,090
Because it's because without that then 
you get super,

3120
02:29:32,091 --> 02:29:33,130
super sick.
Yeah.

3121
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:34,790
Yeah.
That's crazy.

3122
02:29:34,791 --> 02:29:36,200
Is that why they enrich it?
Yeah.

3123
02:29:36,201 --> 02:29:38,860
Because there were a nutrient deficiency
diseases like,

3124
02:29:38,900 --> 02:29:40,100
you know,
19 twenties,

3125
02:29:40,101 --> 02:29:43,940
19 thirties as,
as we really started industrializing the

3126
02:29:43,941 --> 02:29:46,400
food system and you know,
and there's,

3127
02:29:46,450 --> 02:29:51,450
there's a good argument for changing 
wheat flour to white flour when you 

3128
02:29:51,450 --> 02:29:55,670
remove that protein and fatty element 
that's in the whole wheat flour,

3129
02:29:55,700 --> 02:30:00,700
it goes rancid much faster.
So white flour is much more shelf 

3130
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:05,561
stable.
It lasts a lot and also it has a 

3131
02:30:05,561 --> 02:30:05,561
different flavor profile and 
everything's a little more mild.

3132
02:30:05,561 --> 02:30:07,340
But there's a good argument again,
but you know,

3133
02:30:07,341 --> 02:30:09,620
it's like that,
that shelf stability thing,

3134
02:30:09,650 --> 02:30:14,650
this is part of the hallmark of 
something that's maybe not a great 

3135
02:30:14,650 --> 02:30:18,101
option other than chicharrones teacher.
Rene's could last a million years and 

3136
02:30:18,101 --> 02:30:18,101
they're still amazing.
But uh,

3137
02:30:18,390 --> 02:30:20,770
there is an exception to everything,
but you know,

3138
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:26,320
there was economic and pallet incentives
for why you would want to make this 

3139
02:30:28,130 --> 02:30:30,080
white flour.
But it also,

3140
02:30:30,081 --> 02:30:35,081
people started getting more nutrient 
deficiencies because the amount of b 

3141
02:30:35,081 --> 02:30:36,770
vitamins and whatnot that usually come 
in that whole grain where were gone.

3142
02:30:36,830 --> 02:30:41,830
That makes sense.
The zucchini bread is notoriously poor 

3143
02:30:41,830 --> 02:30:42,450
as far as like shelf life.
Yeah.

3144
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,680
It gets moldy.
Like almost immediately.

3145
02:30:45,681 --> 02:30:46,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

3146
02:30:46,110 --> 02:30:51,110
Really building fridge and all that.
That's one of the few breads that I 

3147
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:51,470
always keep in the fridge.
But.

3148
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:53,660
So it's not necessarily good for you 
though.

3149
02:30:53,661 --> 02:30:57,140
It's better for you then say a process 
wheat bread,

3150
02:30:57,141 --> 02:31:01,980
but it's not really good for you.
I'm going to take those.

3151
02:31:02,510 --> 02:31:03,830
No,
I don't know.

3152
02:31:03,831 --> 02:31:08,831
I mean that's a really good question.
I've never really thought about it like 

3153
02:31:08,831 --> 02:31:08,831
that.
You know,

3154
02:31:08,831 --> 02:31:10,710
like is a blueberry good for you?
You as a piece of steak?

3155
02:31:10,880 --> 02:31:11,740
Good for you.
Yeah.

3156
02:31:11,860 --> 02:31:15,310
I don't know,
like you again.

3157
02:31:15,330 --> 02:31:20,120
So if we did a nutrient density kind of 
story and we looked that as equal brag

3158
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:24,800
compared to good types of fruit,
vegetables,

3159
02:31:24,810 --> 02:31:29,810
squash,
I think that the equal bread would look 

3160
02:31:29,810 --> 02:31:32,451
pretty skinny.
Like if you had 100 calories of this 

3161
02:31:32,451 --> 02:31:33,090
versus 100 calories of these.
But again,

3162
02:31:33,091 --> 02:31:35,790
we looked at the vitamins,
minerals,

3163
02:31:35,791 --> 02:31:40,791
antioxidants that both of them had.
I don't think the is eql bread would be 

3164
02:31:40,791 --> 02:31:44,511
a real rock star,
but I bet it would be better than white 

3165
02:31:44,511 --> 02:31:47,661
rice.
It would probably be as good or on par 

3166
02:31:47,661 --> 02:31:48,630
with something like lentils or something
like that.

3167
02:31:48,631 --> 02:31:49,650
Again,
as far as vitamins,

3168
02:31:49,651 --> 02:31:50,790
minerals,
antioxidants,

3169
02:31:50,791 --> 02:31:55,791
all that stuff.
So that's weird to me because I would 

3170
02:31:55,791 --> 02:31:55,791
think that lentils would be vitamin 
rich.

3171
02:31:55,980 --> 02:31:58,530
Not huge,
but they're not terrible either.

3172
02:31:58,531 --> 02:32:01,410
I mean it's just all this kind of 
relative thing.

3173
02:32:01,411 --> 02:32:04,590
and you know,
rhonda patrick is really good about this

3174
02:32:04,591 --> 02:32:09,591
stuff.
She's really geeked out on what are the 

3175
02:32:09,591 --> 02:32:11,391
most nutrient dense foods out there and 
trying to really make an emphasis of of 

3176
02:32:11,391 --> 02:32:11,640
eating those.

3177
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:14,820
And so like sprouts tend to be at the 
topic list.

3178
02:32:14,821 --> 02:32:19,821
And then interestingly,
things like organ meats are super high 

3179
02:32:19,821 --> 02:32:19,821
up on the list and,
and,

3180
02:32:19,821 --> 02:32:24,230
and it starts kind of stratifying our 
herbs and spices tend to be off the 

3181
02:32:24,230 --> 02:32:28,170
richter high in nutrient density,
but we tend to not eat a ton of them,

3182
02:32:28,171 --> 02:32:30,540
but you know,
like ginger and basil and garlic and all

3183
02:32:30,541 --> 02:32:34,180
those things are really,
really nutrient dense and they also seem

3184
02:32:34,181 --> 02:32:36,820
to have medicinal qualities and 
antimicrobial quality.

3185
02:32:36,821 --> 02:32:39,870
So there's some interesting stuff there,
but,

3186
02:32:39,871 --> 02:32:41,130
you know,
at the end of the day,

3187
02:32:41,270 --> 02:32:43,130
um,
you know,

3188
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:44,790
you could,
people do try to do it.

3189
02:32:44,791 --> 02:32:47,940
It's like every meal is going to be 
blueberries and the,

3190
02:32:47,970 --> 02:32:52,970
you know,
wild caught deep water fish and you 

3191
02:32:52,970 --> 02:32:54,810
know,
a mountain of greens in and god love you

3192
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:56,190
for doing that I guess.
But you know,

3193
02:32:56,220 --> 02:33:00,480
every meal does not have to be that way 
to be pretty damn healthy.

3194
02:33:00,480 --> 02:33:01,830
And,
and you know all that.

3195
02:33:01,831 --> 02:33:06,831
So that's where the is equal bread.
I think that's probably not like a 

3196
02:33:06,831 --> 02:33:09,830
terrible.
By no means is it a terrible option in 

3197
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:09,830
the story.
so it's not a terrible option,

3198
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:12,180
but it's not necessarily the most 
nutrient dense than you can eat.

3199
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:12,950
Right,
right,

3200
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:15,390
right,
right,

3201
02:33:15,510 --> 02:33:16,020
right,
right.

3202
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:21,160
Yeah.
Now getting back to what I asked 

3203
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:21,160
earlier,
is there a food that you would recommend

3204
02:33:21,160 --> 02:33:24,300
for a guy who did eat that one pound bag
of potato chips?

3205
02:33:24,301 --> 02:33:27,360
Is there anything or is it fasting maybe
the best?

3206
02:33:27,440 --> 02:33:29,010
Yes,
that's the best option.

3207
02:33:29,011 --> 02:33:34,011
Yeah.
I mean something like that or just you 

3208
02:33:34,011 --> 02:33:34,011
know,
some period of,

3209
02:33:34,011 --> 02:33:35,580
of less intake and so,
you know,

3210
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:38,610
but then that gets like,
I hear people screaming like,

3211
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:40,560
you know,
disordered eating now,

3212
02:33:40,561 --> 02:33:40,980
you know,
I was like,

3213
02:33:40,981 --> 02:33:41,730
oh,
it's food,

3214
02:33:41,760 --> 02:33:42,520
you know,
a,

3215
02:33:42,570 --> 02:33:44,340
a,
a eating disorder.

3216
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:47,280
How does fasting considered an eating 
disorder?

3217
02:33:47,730 --> 02:33:52,730
It's not eating and eating disorders 
seems to me to be like maybe so many 

3218
02:33:52,861 --> 02:33:57,861
bulemia start associating with low like 
anorexia it and potentially the bulemia 

3219
02:33:58,231 --> 02:34:00,630
dna.
Sick people don't fast.

3220
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:04,000
That's what's,
they just don't eat right.

3221
02:34:04,350 --> 02:34:07,710
Um,
well it's interesting again,

3222
02:34:07,711 --> 02:34:09,570
like the,
the only thing.

3223
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:14,960
So you could eat like a cockroach,
like you could walk into a work 

3224
02:34:14,960 --> 02:34:16,410
environment or you know,
like post your photos on instagram.

3225
02:34:16,411 --> 02:34:18,060
About eating,
having a big,

3226
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:20,650
big gulp and donuts and all this other 
fucked up stuff.

3227
02:34:20,651 --> 02:34:23,380
And most dietitians won't really bat an 
eye at that.

3228
02:34:23,381 --> 02:34:23,860
They're like,
yeah,

3229
02:34:23,861 --> 02:34:26,500
you should eat better,
but they're not gonna say anything.

3230
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:31,980
But if you post some stuff about a low 
carb paleo kind of look and deal than 

3231
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:33,310
you're a disorder dieter.
Or if you eat gluten free,

3232
02:34:33,311 --> 02:34:34,690
then they call it disordered eating.

3233
02:34:34,750 --> 02:34:37,150
Intermittent fasting is being called 
disordered eating.

3234
02:34:37,310 --> 02:34:42,310
But,
but who is it being called it by 

3235
02:34:42,310 --> 02:34:42,400
generally like the dietetics,
healthcare,

3236
02:34:42,450 --> 02:34:43,600
you know,
kind of mainstream.

3237
02:34:43,601 --> 02:34:46,150
Like I get a sale by these people all 
the time.

3238
02:34:46,270 --> 02:34:50,860
And the intermittent fasting thing is 
really fascinating because again,

3239
02:34:50,861 --> 02:34:54,340
for just a very brief historical step 
back,

3240
02:34:54,341 --> 02:34:57,160
it's like,
have humans always had three meals a day

3241
02:34:57,400 --> 02:34:59,680
and most people don't even eat just 
three meals a day.

3242
02:34:59,681 --> 02:35:02,260
They just eat all day long,
you know?

3243
02:35:02,261 --> 02:35:02,860
And,
and,

3244
02:35:02,861 --> 02:35:07,861
uh,
and there some clear problems with that 

3245
02:35:07,861 --> 02:35:09,340
from an implementation standpoint.
They've done some studies where they had

3246
02:35:09,341 --> 02:35:13,630
people eat a caloric restricted diet,
which should be anti inflammatory,

3247
02:35:14,050 --> 02:35:19,050
but the one group of calorie restricted 
folks eat consistently throughout the 

3248
02:35:19,050 --> 02:35:22,930
day and they don't get that 
antiinflammatory benefit because they're

3249
02:35:22,931 --> 02:35:27,310
just constantly keeping their digestive 
system going and all that type of stuff.

3250
02:35:27,311 --> 02:35:28,420
So,
you know,

3251
02:35:28,421 --> 02:35:33,421
there's some really,
really strong evidence and suggestion 

3252
02:35:33,421 --> 02:35:35,350
that some sort of punctuated eating 
pattern would be really healthy,

3253
02:35:35,351 --> 02:35:36,190
but it,
it's,

3254
02:35:36,191 --> 02:35:37,270
uh,
it's,

3255
02:35:37,271 --> 02:35:37,740
uh,
it,

3256
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:38,770
it,
it's interesting.

3257
02:35:38,770 --> 02:35:43,770
On the one hand,
it's being really aggressively 

3258
02:35:43,770 --> 02:35:45,250
researched in the kind of cutting edge,
uh,

3259
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:47,020
communities like rhonda,
Patrick valter,

3260
02:35:47,021 --> 02:35:49,720
longo,
dom talks about this stuff a lot,

3261
02:35:49,721 --> 02:35:53,830
but then when you get into kind of thiS 
mainstream dietetics story,

3262
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:59,250
they're just freaked out by this stuff.
Like they really can't wrap their heads 

3263
02:35:59,250 --> 02:36:00,730
saying people probably aren't even 
freaked out about those lap bands.

3264
02:36:01,150 --> 02:36:01,900
Those.
Right.

3265
02:36:01,940 --> 02:36:05,590
This is disgusting bands that they put 
around people's stomachs.

3266
02:36:05,591 --> 02:36:06,850
What do they call them?
Black bands,

3267
02:36:06,851 --> 02:36:08,450
right?
Yeah.

3268
02:36:09,250 --> 02:36:14,250
I saw some guy arguing for a vegan diet 
and then I found out that he was a 

3269
02:36:14,250 --> 02:36:16,270
surgeon that performed stomach shrinking
operations.

3270
02:36:16,271 --> 02:36:16,930
Yeah,
yeah.

3271
02:36:16,931 --> 02:36:17,550
Uh,
yeah,

3272
02:36:17,650 --> 02:36:22,650
yeah,
like what the fUck band are you trying 

3273
02:36:22,650 --> 02:36:22,650
to get people healthy?
Are you just trying to make money?

3274
02:36:22,650 --> 02:36:23,260
Right.
That's great.

3275
02:36:23,650 --> 02:36:27,160
We'll with some Folks is the only option
bullshit.

3276
02:36:27,580 --> 02:36:28,780
It's never the only option.

3277
02:36:28,780 --> 02:36:30,580
Does your mouth work?
Do your hands.

3278
02:36:30,581 --> 02:36:32,560
Where Can you put food in your mouth?
Then?

3279
02:36:32,561 --> 02:36:37,000
It's not the only option to and 
disempowering people or saying that it's

3280
02:36:37,001 --> 02:36:38,980
the only option for some folks to get 
them healthy.

3281
02:36:39,370 --> 02:36:44,370
That is insanity.
You are coddling them to the point of 

3282
02:36:44,370 --> 02:36:46,300
you're,
you're willing to diminish their,

3283
02:36:46,330 --> 02:36:50,590
their overall physical structure of 
their digestive system.

3284
02:36:50,790 --> 02:36:51,610
I mean,
that's what you're doing,

3285
02:36:51,611 --> 02:36:56,611
right?
I've read some horrendous things about 

3286
02:36:56,611 --> 02:36:57,320
the consequences of these stomach 
mineralization,

3287
02:36:57,350 --> 02:37:01,720
uh,
activities or the surgeries rather.

3288
02:37:02,150 --> 02:37:07,150
It's really scary stuff.
You have to completely limit what you 

3289
02:37:07,150 --> 02:37:09,931
eat from now on.
Your stomach is about the size of my 

3290
02:37:09,931 --> 02:37:12,271
fist.
Now it's this little tiny thing and you 

3291
02:37:12,271 --> 02:37:14,611
get full quicker.
So that's the psychological mechanism 

3292
02:37:14,611 --> 02:37:14,780
behind it.
You get full quicker and,

3293
02:37:14,900 --> 02:37:15,770
but,
uh,

3294
02:37:15,771 --> 02:37:20,771
the rabbit.
So the interesting thing is almost 

3295
02:37:20,771 --> 02:37:21,620
immediately when people undergo these 
procedures,

3296
02:37:21,680 --> 02:37:26,680
if they were like a type two diabetic,
like they come out of it and they're no 

3297
02:37:26,680 --> 02:37:27,920
longer a type two diabetic,
almost immediately,

3298
02:37:27,921 --> 02:37:30,020
like it's really,
really interesting.

3299
02:37:30,500 --> 02:37:33,630
So there's that upside.
But then also the longterm,

3300
02:37:33,770 --> 02:37:34,640
you know,
two years,

3301
02:37:34,641 --> 02:37:35,660
three years,
four years,

3302
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:39,440
almost inevitably they get themselves 
back into the situation they were in.

3303
02:37:39,730 --> 02:37:43,730
And part of what's interesting is 
because they have such a small stomach,

3304
02:37:44,090 --> 02:37:49,090
they can't hardly eat anything.
So there's a tendency towards eating 

3305
02:37:49,090 --> 02:37:50,900
more refined food because that,
that's,

3306
02:37:50,930 --> 02:37:51,410
you know,
they,

3307
02:37:51,470 --> 02:37:55,070
they just can't eat that much.
So it's um,

3308
02:37:55,490 --> 02:37:57,770
I know a guy broke his out.
Oh really?

3309
02:37:58,100 --> 02:38:00,440
Oh wow.
He got a stomach shrunk,

3310
02:38:00,500 --> 02:38:05,500
got an operation.
She's a big fat guy and got a stomach 

3311
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:06,710
cut and then broke it out and had to go 
and get a second surgery.

3312
02:38:07,310 --> 02:38:08,570
YeaH,
it's a,

3313
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:11,840
that's where I'm very glad I didn't go 
into medicine specifically.

3314
02:38:11,841 --> 02:38:16,841
Like that's just such a quagmire.
I would probably shoot myself being in 

3315
02:38:16,841 --> 02:38:21,131
it.
Get infuriated when someone says that 

3316
02:38:21,131 --> 02:38:21,131
that's the only option.

3317
02:38:21,131 --> 02:38:22,490
For some people that is not true.
That is just absolutely not true.

3318
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:25,220
There are always options if you have 
willpower of you,

3319
02:38:25,221 --> 02:38:26,720
have a mind.
If you have a support system,

3320
02:38:26,960 --> 02:38:29,150
if you have people that can coach you,
if you're willing to listen,

3321
02:38:29,151 --> 02:38:34,151
if you're willing to understand and 
believe the consequences of your 

3322
02:38:34,151 --> 02:38:36,641
actions,
you can change your diet and your 

3323
02:38:36,641 --> 02:38:36,641
behavior.
You can,

3324
02:38:36,641 --> 02:38:39,060
and it doesn't matter if you're 600 
pounds or 60 pounds overweight,

3325
02:38:39,090 --> 02:38:41,300
86 pounds overweight,
you can make changes.

3326
02:38:41,380 --> 02:38:46,380
it,
it's interesting because insurance will 

3327
02:38:46,380 --> 02:38:47,600
reimburse for these like lap band,
gastric bypass surgeries and they're 30,

3328
02:38:47,601 --> 02:38:49,190
$40,000
to,

3329
02:38:49,210 --> 02:38:52,850
to pump people through it,
but it's really difficult to get them to

3330
02:38:52,851 --> 02:38:55,670
reimburse like a gym membership,
a health coach,

3331
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,740
you know,
that type of stuff.

3332
02:38:57,741 --> 02:38:58,820
Which,
which um,

3333
02:38:59,090 --> 02:39:02,450
well it's got to be some collusion 
between the healthcare providers and the

3334
02:39:02,480 --> 02:39:03,290
medical industry.

3335
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:04,270
I mean,
just to dylan,

3336
02:39:04,330 --> 02:39:07,400
that's the only thing that makes sense 
or that people demand it so much so they

3337
02:39:07,401 --> 02:39:09,370
can't deny it from people.
Right.

3338
02:39:10,320 --> 02:39:15,320
It's just very,
very frustrating for me when you tell 

3339
02:39:15,320 --> 02:39:17,681
people that they don't have any other 
options and that this is the best 

3340
02:39:17,681 --> 02:39:21,341
options to cut you open and cut your 
stomach and stitch it back to a smaller 

3341
02:39:22,191 --> 02:39:23,990
version of it.
Didn't have what it is.

3342
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:24,670
Well,
it end.

3343
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:29,680
Did you see that thing wheRe they now 
have a stomach pump where you can,

3344
02:39:29,810 --> 02:39:32,210
they,
they basically put a tube in there,

3345
02:39:32,211 --> 02:39:37,211
you can eat the food and then pump the 
food out of the stomach and this thing 

3346
02:39:37,211 --> 02:39:41,030
is awaiting fda approval.
So they stay in roman times.

3347
02:39:41,031 --> 02:39:42,230
This is where like,
you know,

3348
02:39:42,231 --> 02:39:42,740
the,
the,

3349
02:39:42,741 --> 02:39:43,260
uh,
uh,

3350
02:39:43,370 --> 02:39:45,940
bread and circus just keep everybody 
entertained and that old,

3351
02:39:45,950 --> 02:39:50,950
the whole thing collapses.
But they used to have the vomitorium 

3352
02:39:50,950 --> 02:39:50,950
where people would eat.
Do you know tHat?

3353
02:39:50,950 --> 02:39:52,380
That's not true.
Really?

3354
02:39:52,381 --> 02:39:57,381
Yeah.
Not only is it not true vomitorium 

3355
02:39:57,381 --> 02:39:57,381
doesn't mean that we.
What vomitorium means,

3356
02:39:57,381 --> 02:40:00,620
it's the entrance and exit to an arena.
The volley.

3357
02:40:00,621 --> 02:40:03,020
Yes.
This is something that I've gone into in

3358
02:40:03,021 --> 02:40:08,021
great detail and I went to the colosseum
in rome and they explained the 

3359
02:40:08,021 --> 02:40:10,100
vomitorium and it's just a misdemeanor.
You're crushing.

3360
02:40:10,101 --> 02:40:12,980
My head shouldn't be saying that this is
crushing.

3361
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:14,340
My whole,
like rome

3362
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:19,340
fell work in a fall.
These guys used to throw up and now 

3363
02:40:19,340 --> 02:40:19,470
we're doing it.
They may have done that.

3364
02:40:19,471 --> 02:40:24,471
They may have thrown up,
but it wasn't that a vomitorium 

3365
02:40:24,471 --> 02:40:24,471
vomitorium is here.
Pull it up jamie.

3366
02:40:24,471 --> 02:40:27,570
So he could see what a vomitorium is.
What a vomitorium is,

3367
02:40:27,571 --> 02:40:32,571
is the actual structure of an arena like
where the people come out and go through

3368
02:40:32,911 --> 02:40:35,820
this area and it has nothing to do with 
the word vomit.

3369
02:40:36,180 --> 02:40:37,620
Okay.
How am I going to tell them?

3370
02:40:37,621 --> 02:40:41,580
My post apocalyptic story about rome got
fucked heading.

3371
02:40:42,720 --> 02:40:47,640
That sort of vomitorium is okay,
but how do I tell the fucked up?

3372
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:48,830
You should have googled it,
man.

3373
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:49,860
dude,
you should've done a.

3374
02:40:49,861 --> 02:40:50,940
We did.
You fucked up.

3375
02:40:50,941 --> 02:40:55,310
You tried to pass away some some 
bullshit man up.

3376
02:40:55,311 --> 02:40:56,230
So chagrined.
But.

3377
02:40:56,580 --> 02:41:01,580
But it's important because I read a lot 
of people telling me that and educated 

3378
02:41:01,580 --> 02:41:01,680
people like yourself have said that it's
just not true.

3379
02:41:01,710 --> 02:41:06,710
Okay.
That's what a go back to that image of 

3380
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:06,710
assist.
Yeah.

3381
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:10,110
This,
these vomitorium exist in every arena.

3382
02:41:10,170 --> 02:41:15,170
That's what they are.
The stairways come down and then that 

3383
02:41:15,170 --> 02:41:15,510
opening at the bottom of the stairway,
that is a vomitorium,

3384
02:41:15,950 --> 02:41:17,760
but what is the origin of the word?
Now?

3385
02:41:17,761 --> 02:41:19,230
They threw up,
they threw up.

3386
02:41:19,231 --> 02:41:21,490
A few of them did really rich people.
They wanted to eat and keep eating.

3387
02:41:21,550 --> 02:41:23,490
They threw up,
but that's not what it is.

3388
02:41:23,500 --> 02:41:27,560
Like go larger please.
So I can see that his series of interest

3389
02:41:27,561 --> 02:41:30,690
is or exit pastures in ancient roman 
amphitheater or theater.

3390
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:33,360
A place where which according to popular
misconception,

3391
02:41:33,720 --> 02:41:38,720
the ancient romans were supposed to have
vomited during fees to make room for 

3392
02:41:38,720 --> 02:41:38,720
more food.
Not true.

3393
02:41:38,720 --> 02:41:39,510
THere you go.
Damn.

3394
02:41:39,511 --> 02:41:40,890
Sorry dude.
Oh man.

3395
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:44,400
It's important that you know about it 
that I am properly chagrin thing.

3396
02:41:44,410 --> 02:41:49,410
Yeah.
It's just one of those things that 

3397
02:41:49,410 --> 02:41:49,410
people repeat and then they never 
bothered looking it up.

3398
02:41:49,410 --> 02:41:51,150
Um,
would that pump though?

3399
02:41:51,210 --> 02:41:53,610
Go back to that fucking disgusting 
stomach pump.

3400
02:41:54,150 --> 02:41:56,430
This is so nasty.
So this is a high.

3401
02:41:56,431 --> 02:42:01,431
I'm fat and my brain is stupid and I 
just love to eat so I can eat now and 

3402
02:42:02,071 --> 02:42:04,650
yay.
Eat normal healthy meals.

3403
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:08,310
Hey,
that girl in the middle is triggered,

3404
02:42:08,340 --> 02:42:13,340
I can tell,
and then you stick this pump through a 

3405
02:42:13,340 --> 02:42:14,610
fucking hole in your belly button and it
sucks out the food because nothing could

3406
02:42:14,611 --> 02:42:15,380
go wrong.
Look at that.

3407
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:17,670
Look at her for honey.
Go outside,

3408
02:42:17,700 --> 02:42:19,320
go running.
Stop.

3409
02:42:19,530 --> 02:42:24,530
Look at me.
I put the food in my mouth and it sends 

3410
02:42:24,530 --> 02:42:26,370
a signal to my brain.
It's a simple procedure.

3411
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:28,890
Low risk,
completely reversible.

3412
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:32,850
Takes just 15 minutes.
How about fuck you?

3413
02:42:33,690 --> 02:42:37,110
Twilight sedation back in home and just 
a couple of hours.

3414
02:42:37,380 --> 02:42:42,380
Look at that cartoon,
the cartoon people like that girl needs 

3415
02:42:42,380 --> 02:42:43,110
it.
That girl's hot as fuck.

3416
02:42:43,140 --> 02:42:45,180
She's skinny.
Even cartoon hot.

3417
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:46,920
This is ridiculous.
You don't need it,

3418
02:42:46,921 --> 02:42:48,060
honey.
Stop.

3419
02:42:48,400 --> 02:42:49,800
Well,
I think this is her afterwards.

3420
02:42:49,890 --> 02:42:51,090
Oh,
that's her.

3421
02:42:51,440 --> 02:42:54,220
This is all these people that have 
shrunk down from having.

3422
02:42:54,240 --> 02:42:56,490
When I go back to that,
go back to that.

3423
02:42:57,630 --> 02:43:02,630
Here's the thing folks,
all you people that have benefited from 

3424
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:02,630
it,
you could do another thing.

3425
02:43:02,630 --> 02:43:06,540
You could just change your diet and one 
of the most powerful benefits of the key

3426
02:43:06,541 --> 02:43:11,541
to genic died.
His appetite suppression and that 

3427
02:43:11,541 --> 02:43:12,580
appetite suppression is fantastic.
It's amazing.

3428
02:43:12,581 --> 02:43:15,310
Even for a person like me who's never 
really struggled with their weight,

3429
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:20,170
I find that going without food is not 
only is it easy,

3430
02:43:20,470 --> 02:43:23,410
but it's really inconsequential.
It's not an issue at all.

3431
02:43:23,411 --> 02:43:25,180
I can go without for five,
six hours,

3432
02:43:25,181 --> 02:43:26,680
you know,
it doesn't bother me at all.

3433
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:28,370
Yeah.
It's um,

3434
02:43:28,580 --> 02:43:30,920
it's super liberating and you know,
the tooth,

3435
02:43:31,520 --> 02:43:36,520
it's powerful as it is.
It can also be where people get 

3436
02:43:36,520 --> 02:43:39,911
themselves in trouble.
A lot of the problems that are ascribed 

3437
02:43:39,911 --> 02:43:43,001
to just low carb I think is an outgrowth
of it being so satiating that you under 

3438
02:43:44,390 --> 02:43:49,390
eat.
So if you are hypo caloric for too 

3439
02:43:49,390 --> 02:43:49,850
often,
too long,

3440
02:43:50,390 --> 02:43:52,580
the net can be a big problem.
I don't have issues with that.

3441
02:43:52,950 --> 02:43:53,880
I eat like a pig,
but.

3442
02:43:53,881 --> 02:43:54,050
Right.

3443
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:59,100
Um,
but I've definitely lost weight by 

3444
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:02,021
changing my diet to that ketogenic diet.
And I've met so many people on the 

3445
02:44:02,021 --> 02:44:06,491
roads.
So many people want a mountain about 

3446
02:44:06,491 --> 02:44:06,491
that come up to me and they say,
thank you.

3447
02:44:06,491 --> 02:44:06,890
I've lost 60 pounds.
Thank you.

3448
02:44:06,891 --> 02:44:08,120
I've lost 80 pounds.
Thank you.

3449
02:44:08,121 --> 02:44:11,090
I've changed my diet,
I drink kale shakes in the morning,

3450
02:44:11,091 --> 02:44:16,091
and now my body is just a completely 
different thing and it just feels 

3451
02:44:16,091 --> 02:44:16,091
different.
It works better.

3452
02:44:16,700 --> 02:44:17,690
So important,
man.

3453
02:44:17,691 --> 02:44:22,691
It's just so important to take care of 
this meat vehicle that you're driving 

3454
02:44:22,691 --> 02:44:25,571
around.
It's so many people are falling prey to 

3455
02:44:25,571 --> 02:44:29,771
that supermarket line of cans with shiny
colors on the labels and you get roped 

3456
02:44:31,191 --> 02:44:33,290
into this idea that just because you put
it in your mouth,

3457
02:44:33,291 --> 02:44:38,291
it's food and your body is just sludge.
It's just slugged down with all this 

3458
02:44:38,291 --> 02:44:39,020
nonsense

3459
02:44:39,450 --> 02:44:44,450
in a ketogenic diet is interesting.
Some people that seem to never really be

3460
02:44:45,391 --> 02:44:50,391
able to get anything else to work.
It's possible they may have some damage 

3461
02:44:50,391 --> 02:44:54,711
to the hypothalamus,
the energy regulating centers of the 

3462
02:44:54,711 --> 02:44:54,720
brain.
It's unclear what's going on,

3463
02:44:54,721 --> 02:44:59,721
but we we know that a key to genic diet,
it has some really great benefits for 

3464
02:44:59,721 --> 02:45:01,710
neurological conditions in general like 
epilepsy.

3465
02:45:01,830 --> 02:45:06,830
Some parkinson's alzheimer's research 
that's going on and conditions are 

3466
02:45:06,830 --> 02:45:09,120
conditions,
but it's possible that these ketones may

3467
02:45:09,121 --> 02:45:14,121
be altering to the physiology of the 
hypothalamus in such a way that we get 

3468
02:45:14,280 --> 02:45:17,670
normal energy regulation of metabolism 
and appetite.

3469
02:45:17,671 --> 02:45:20,310
More importantly,
cognitive benefits as well.

3470
02:45:20,311 --> 02:45:22,290
It's another thing when people don't 
have that lazy,

3471
02:45:22,291 --> 02:45:24,090
foggy feeling after meals,

3472
02:45:24,140 --> 02:45:29,140
right,
and that foggy feeling is pretty 

3473
02:45:29,140 --> 02:45:29,870
substantial and really important.
If you're someone who has to think for a

3474
02:45:29,871 --> 02:45:34,640
living that's hopefully is most most 
people hopefully I think in some way,

3475
02:45:34,910 --> 02:45:38,810
but you know your brain running on 
ketones,

3476
02:45:39,050 --> 02:45:41,030
that's the one of the things that people
are always scared about.

3477
02:45:41,031 --> 02:45:41,450
Like,
oh man,

3478
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:42,940
your.
Your brain runs on sugar.

3479
02:45:42,941 --> 02:45:43,050
Sugar.

3480
02:45:43,050 --> 02:45:45,630
You need glucose to run your brain.
That's not really true.

3481
02:45:45,810 --> 02:45:46,980
Right?
Right.

3482
02:45:47,460 --> 02:45:49,950
In again,
like 70,

3483
02:45:49,951 --> 02:45:54,300
80 percent of the brain tends to shift 
to just ketone body metabolism.

3484
02:45:54,301 --> 02:45:59,301
When you're fully keto adapted,
there's still some of the brain that's 

3485
02:45:59,301 --> 02:46:02,061
going to run on glucose.
There's some red blood cells that are 

3486
02:46:02,061 --> 02:46:02,061
going to run on glucose,
but the.

3487
02:46:02,061 --> 02:46:04,380
The interesting thing though is that you
just have.

3488
02:46:04,410 --> 02:46:06,390
If you just look at blood glucose over 
time,

3489
02:46:06,391 --> 02:46:09,090
there's a pretty cool

3490
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:15,680
a guy went on a medically supervised 
fast for 382 days and you look at his 

3491
02:46:16,041 --> 02:46:19,550
blood glucose levels and is beta 
hydroxybutyrate levels and whatnot.

3492
02:46:19,580 --> 02:46:21,770
Do that.
He just drank water.

3493
02:46:22,040 --> 02:46:23,710
He drank water,
had some electrolytes.

3494
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:27,350
Day 382 days stay alive.
I don't even understand the fat.

3495
02:46:27,510 --> 02:46:29,930
What that was.
This guy that.

3496
02:46:30,530 --> 02:46:33,030
Yeah,
it should have a picture of the guy when

3497
02:46:33,031 --> 02:46:34,180
he,
when you track it down,

3498
02:46:34,181 --> 02:46:37,400
if it was over 400 pounds,
he went from over 400,

3499
02:46:37,401 --> 02:46:38,690
I think,
close to 500 pounds.

3500
02:46:38,691 --> 02:46:43,691
Down to 180 pounds.
I think he finished off like 180 pounds.

3501
02:46:43,820 --> 02:46:47,090
Guy didn't eat for 382 days.
Didn't poop for almost two months.

3502
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:48,900
Whoa.
He fat.

3503
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:53,950
Hold on.
He fasted for over a year and somehow 

3504
02:46:53,950 --> 02:46:58,061
lived.
How far can you go without risking your 

3505
02:46:58,061 --> 02:46:58,061
health?
Whoa.

3506
02:46:58,061 --> 02:46:59,270
Is there a before and after photos of 
this gentleman?

3507
02:46:59,480 --> 02:47:01,490
This is it.
It was,

3508
02:47:01,491 --> 02:47:05,750
um,
if you go to this and just go to,

3509
02:47:05,751 --> 02:47:07,280
um,
the images,

3510
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:11,590
then you'll probably see like a,
a yeah,

3511
02:47:11,591 --> 02:47:15,760
go to images and then we'll have 
something with the beta hydroxy.

3512
02:47:16,590 --> 02:47:18,510
I'm not seeing it.
Huh?

3513
02:47:18,970 --> 02:47:23,970
That's incredible.
Imagine if you knew this guy and you 

3514
02:47:23,970 --> 02:47:23,970
didn't see him for a year.
Could you throw ketosis in there also?

3515
02:47:26,450 --> 02:47:26,660
S

3516
02:47:27,740 --> 02:47:31,430
amazing if you did a fifth one over 
that.

3517
02:47:31,770 --> 02:47:32,810
Yep.
Nope,

3518
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:34,130
that one right there.
Yep.

3519
02:47:35,180 --> 02:47:40,180
So blood glucose,
free fatty acids and ketone body levels 

3520
02:47:40,180 --> 02:47:41,510
during his fast.
So his blood glucose,

3521
02:47:41,511 --> 02:47:46,511
that second from the top line,
the triangles that dropped and then was 

3522
02:47:46,511 --> 02:47:49,850
just rock solid beta hydroxybutyrate,
which is that,

3523
02:47:49,940 --> 02:47:50,690
that,
um,

3524
02:47:51,110 --> 02:47:56,110
the main ketone body that,
that gets used as a fuel substrate that 

3525
02:47:56,110 --> 02:48:01,001
goes up to a pretty high level higher 
than what you would get under a 

3526
02:48:01,001 --> 02:48:02,450
nutritional ketosis typically because 
this is a starvation deal.

3527
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:06,530
Free fatty acids elevate a cdot acetate,
elevates a cdot acetate,

3528
02:48:06,531 --> 02:48:08,750
kind of interconvert to with the beta 
hydroxy butyrate.

3529
02:48:08,751 --> 02:48:11,930
But what's interesting to your point 
about the mental state,

3530
02:48:12,410 --> 02:48:17,410
if we were graphing someone's blood 
glucose over time for this period of 40 

3531
02:48:17,410 --> 02:48:20,150
days and they were eating normal mixed 
meals,

3532
02:48:20,450 --> 02:48:23,540
that thing would be seesawing all over 
the place,

3533
02:48:23,670 --> 02:48:28,130
understand how he has any glucose 
because gluconeogenesis in the liver,

3534
02:48:28,280 --> 02:48:33,280
so he's he even eating a hunter like 
absolutely no carbohydrate at all.

3535
02:48:34,470 --> 02:48:39,470
There was a glycerol backbone of fat 
that can get converted into glucose and 

3536
02:48:39,470 --> 02:48:44,411
then also certain amino acids which are 
gluconeogenic can get converted into 

3537
02:48:44,411 --> 02:48:48,731
glucose and so the body will use those 
because we still need like just making 

3538
02:48:48,731 --> 02:48:50,720
dna,
the pentose phosphate pathway.

3539
02:48:51,080 --> 02:48:53,300
We need some glucose to be able to do 
that.

3540
02:48:53,301 --> 02:48:55,300
So like cellular replication and 
whatnot.

3541
02:48:55,310 --> 02:48:58,070
But you can do that with effectively no 
carb.

3542
02:48:58,100 --> 02:49:02,390
So without dietary glucose,
the body converts fat to glucose,

3543
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:04,850
some of the backbone of fat,
the glycerol part,

3544
02:49:04,851 --> 02:49:06,470
and then also proteins.
Yeah,

3545
02:49:06,890 --> 02:49:09,480
but with this guy,
it's not even proteins unless his body's

3546
02:49:09,481 --> 02:49:13,020
eating his meat,
which they probably did to some degree,

3547
02:49:13,021 --> 02:49:18,021
but this is part of the benefit of 
ketosis is that it really reduces the 

3548
02:49:18,021 --> 02:49:21,940
breakdown of lean body mass,
but if you think about it like there are

3549
02:49:22,260 --> 02:49:25,410
people who end up with these huge,
you know,

3550
02:49:25,680 --> 02:49:28,410
folds of skin that need to get it 
surgically removed.

3551
02:49:28,730 --> 02:49:32,460
There was a pretty good argument that 
had they used a fasting protocol instead

3552
02:49:32,461 --> 02:49:35,460
of like a low fat higher protein 
protocol.

3553
02:49:35,880 --> 02:49:38,700
If that protein is still being supplied 
in the diet,

3554
02:49:39,090 --> 02:49:42,510
then even though the fat goes away,
you still have the protein matrix of the

3555
02:49:42,511 --> 02:49:47,511
skin and the interstitial.
A connective tissue that isn't going to 

3556
02:49:48,001 --> 02:49:50,460
go away,
but when we're more in that fasted state

3557
02:49:50,461 --> 02:49:52,860
or intermittent fasting or maybe 
ketosis,

3558
02:49:53,370 --> 02:49:57,360
the body is turning over that protein 
base and that's really important.

3559
02:49:57,361 --> 02:50:02,361
That's this apoptotic process,
but you could potentially have a 

3560
02:50:02,361 --> 02:50:06,381
scenario where people who are losing a 
lot of weight if they use these fasting 

3561
02:50:06,381 --> 02:50:09,651
protocols,
aren't going to need that cosmetic 

3562
02:50:09,651 --> 02:50:09,651
surgery at the end to get rid of these 
sales.

3563
02:50:09,651 --> 02:50:10,140
Of.
Of skin,

3564
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:12,420
is that possible?
Is that really possible?

3565
02:50:12,421 --> 02:50:13,860
Yeah,
but has anyone done it?

3566
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:16,500
I mean,
it's anecdotal at this point,

3567
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:20,190
so if they've done this,
why don't they do well,

3568
02:50:20,191 --> 02:50:21,240
what happened to this gentleman?

3569
02:50:21,270 --> 02:50:22,830
Well,
this guy looked totally normal.

3570
02:50:22,831 --> 02:50:27,831
That's the thing.
I mean he was huge and then it looked 

3571
02:50:27,831 --> 02:50:27,831
totally normal.
You didn't have ridiculous lose fat,

3572
02:50:27,831 --> 02:50:28,950
right?
Flying squirrels skin.

3573
02:50:29,010 --> 02:50:34,010
Right.
Whereas like a lot of the people that 

3574
02:50:34,010 --> 02:50:34,010
you saw in like the biggest loser,
like they,

3575
02:50:34,010 --> 02:50:37,260
they had that stuff and they were using 
a higher carb,

3576
02:50:37,620 --> 02:50:41,790
moderate protein kind of deal.
Sorry to interrupt.

3577
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:46,791
Does your body have the ability to 
understand that the skin that's hanging 

3578
02:50:46,791 --> 02:50:47,610
loose is not necessarily.
Yes.

3579
02:50:47,940 --> 02:50:49,830
Yeah.
Just kind of mechanical receptors.

3580
02:50:49,831 --> 02:50:52,650
This piezoelectric effect effective 
feedback of all that.

3581
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:54,870
Yeah.
What about people that have lost all the

3582
02:50:54,871 --> 02:50:59,871
weight in another fashion and now 
they've gotten to them themselves into 

3583
02:50:59,871 --> 02:51:01,320
this really thin body with all this 
extra skin?

3584
02:51:01,321 --> 02:51:06,321
Could they go on a fasting protocol then
and would the body absorb that skin 

3585
02:51:06,321 --> 02:51:08,850
tissue first before it started eating up
the muscle tissue height?

3586
02:51:09,210 --> 02:51:14,210
Possibly,
but the challenge with that is it 

3587
02:51:14,210 --> 02:51:14,880
because they've already decrease their 
fat mass,

3588
02:51:14,881 --> 02:51:18,150
like are they now leading this into an 
unhealthy state?

3589
02:51:18,151 --> 02:51:19,740
So what,
what if they decided,

3590
02:51:19,890 --> 02:51:24,890
let me fatten up again,
like maybe the move would be to fatten 

3591
02:51:24,890 --> 02:51:28,761
up again and get yourself obese again 
and then go on this.

3592
02:51:28,890 --> 02:51:33,890
I meAn you're laughing,
but honestly wouldn't that be the move 

3593
02:51:33,890 --> 02:51:36,381
to get yourself fat again and then going
on a fasting like this guy's monitoring 

3594
02:51:36,661 --> 02:51:41,661
medical medically monitored fasting and 
then your body would absorb the fat 

3595
02:51:41,661 --> 02:51:44,370
again and the skin tissue.
Maybe I would.

3596
02:51:44,430 --> 02:51:45,780
Maybe.
It's interesting.

3597
02:51:45,781 --> 02:51:47,340
I would have never thought about doing 
that.

3598
02:51:47,341 --> 02:51:51,000
I would maybe think about like two or 
three days a week of fasting,

3599
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:55,200
so some intermittent fasting and then 
you get into some normal eating and then

3600
02:51:55,230 --> 02:52:00,230
even what you could do is you could go a
two or three days of fasting or a very 

3601
02:52:01,771 --> 02:52:06,771
low calorie intake and then at the end 
of that period you could just be very 

3602
02:52:06,771 --> 02:52:10,921
low protein and then maybe four out of 
the five days,

3603
02:52:11,321 --> 02:52:16,321
four out of seven days your low protein 
and two or three of those days you're 

3604
02:52:16,321 --> 02:52:17,560
super low calorie.

3605
02:52:17,620 --> 02:52:18,880
What have you tried that and it didn't 
work.

3606
02:52:18,881 --> 02:52:21,640
You still got that floppy skin.
Then it would suck.

3607
02:52:21,641 --> 02:52:24,580
You'd be driving and this guy might have
it nailed.

3608
02:52:24,610 --> 02:52:25,590
Yeah,
yeah.

3609
02:52:25,660 --> 02:52:26,920
Fuck,
you got to get fat again.

3610
02:52:26,921 --> 02:52:28,480
Folks,
don't get the surgery.

3611
02:52:28,481 --> 02:52:31,300
Just get fat again.
Don't say that to people though.

3612
02:52:31,301 --> 02:52:36,301
It's hard to say because nobody wants to
do that because it's so hard to lose 

3613
02:52:36,301 --> 02:52:36,301
that weight.
Right?

3614
02:52:36,430 --> 02:52:40,090
Once you lost that kind of so,
but when people do get that operation,

3615
02:52:40,091 --> 02:52:42,190
when they cut their skin and it's really
dangerous,

3616
02:52:42,470 --> 02:52:45,340
super dangerous.
There's a high risk of infection,

3617
02:52:45,400 --> 02:52:46,990
a high bleeding.
Yeah,

3618
02:52:47,070 --> 02:52:48,930
yeah,
I mean it's horrendous.

3619
02:52:49,030 --> 02:52:50,200
Yeah.
It doesn't.

3620
02:52:50,201 --> 02:52:53,470
Usually finnish guy who got attacked 
with a knife or something,

3621
02:52:53,471 --> 02:52:56,010
you know,
covered in these das of sorts.

3622
02:52:56,011 --> 02:52:56,780
Yeah,
yeah.

3623
02:52:56,830 --> 02:53:01,830
Score,
score scars or either you have a book 

3624
02:53:01,830 --> 02:53:01,830
out.
Yeah.

3625
02:53:01,830 --> 02:53:02,920
Yeah.
That's the book wired to eat.

3626
02:53:03,010 --> 02:53:08,010
Was it about.
It's about the neuro regulation of 

3627
02:53:08,010 --> 02:53:08,010
appetite.
Oh,

3628
02:53:08,010 --> 02:53:08,500
well we've been talking about a bunch of
it.

3629
02:53:08,501 --> 02:53:09,100
Yeah.
Yeah.

3630
02:53:09,101 --> 02:53:10,720
So I mean a bunch of the stuff like the 
uh,

3631
02:53:10,721 --> 02:53:15,721
the ice cream deal,
like I talk about that stuff in the 

3632
02:53:15,721 --> 02:53:15,721
book.
Um,

3633
02:53:15,721 --> 02:53:15,721
it's,
you know,

3634
02:53:15,721 --> 02:53:18,490
it's steeped in this evolutionary 
medicine perspective,

3635
02:53:18,491 --> 02:53:21,100
but I'm really,
if I'm effective with this,

3636
02:53:21,101 --> 02:53:26,101
I'm really trying to decouple people are
like unpack all the emotionality that 

3637
02:53:26,411 --> 02:53:31,411
they've got around food.
Like if they've found challenges around 

3638
02:53:31,411 --> 02:53:34,471
changing their diet and lifestyle,
it shouldn't be a surprise and it's not 

3639
02:53:34,471 --> 02:53:38,611
their fault,
but at the same time I don't want them 

3640
02:53:38,611 --> 02:53:38,611
to just roll over and give up.
Like we,

3641
02:53:38,611 --> 02:53:43,170
we've got ways to move them through a 
process of discovering what works for 

3642
02:53:43,170 --> 02:53:47,671
them,
what doesn't work for them and we can 

3643
02:53:47,671 --> 02:53:47,671
move her forward.
But I would say like 50,

3644
02:53:47,671 --> 02:53:50,410
60 percent of the people that end up 
failing in this process,

3645
02:53:50,740 --> 02:53:54,340
it's kind of emotional baggage type 
stuff and also there's this sense.

3646
02:53:54,690 --> 02:53:56,680
So when people are at jujitsu and 
they're like,

3647
02:53:56,681 --> 02:53:57,730
man,
this shit's really hard.

3648
02:53:57,731 --> 02:53:58,840
It's like,
yeah,

3649
02:53:59,650 --> 02:54:01,270
if you want to keep doing it then do it.
But it's,

3650
02:54:01,540 --> 02:54:02,950
it's hard.
It's always hard.

3651
02:54:03,340 --> 02:54:08,340
And similarly,
doing diet and lifestyle changes 

3652
02:54:08,340 --> 02:54:12,210
frequently is pretty difficult.
And so if you can just understand that 

3653
02:54:12,210 --> 02:54:16,471
and understand that that's normal and 
you're not beating yourself up about 

3654
02:54:16,471 --> 02:54:19,891
that process,
that we really stand a much better 

3655
02:54:19,891 --> 02:54:21,490
chance of turning that corner and making
these effective,

3656
02:54:21,491 --> 02:54:23,560
longstanding changes.
All right,

3657
02:54:23,561 --> 02:54:25,510
so the book is out right now,
right now.

3658
02:54:25,570 --> 02:54:27,970
Rob wolf.
Then get it to amazon.

3659
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,560
I'll anywhere books are sold.
Yep.

3660
02:54:29,740 --> 02:54:30,730
Yep.
Alright dude.

3661
02:54:30,731 --> 02:54:32,650
Well thank you very much for being here.
Thank you for having great,

3662
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:35,860
sweet robb wolf,
ladies and gentlemen.

3663
02:54:36,370 --> 02:54:37,660
All right,
this show's over.

3664
02:54:37,720 --> 02:54:39,310
Go do something else.
Bye.

3665
02:54:39,311 --> 02:54:39,760
Love you.
