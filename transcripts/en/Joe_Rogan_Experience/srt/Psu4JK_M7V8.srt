1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,430
Start recording,
Bam.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,460
So having right now,
but just says off air though,

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,200
this is all fair.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,990
Oh,
well you have to refresh that screen.

5
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,510
Anyone else?
Too High.

6
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,130
Alright,
here we go.

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,340
We're live.
Bitches.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,290
It's me and Batman.
Batman with me.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,690
So I don't fuck around.
This is a,

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,420
some new show.
Everybody with this is.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,680
This is some new bad ass jacket that you
can get that allows you to also be a 

12
00:00:43,691 --> 00:00:48,691
robber.
You can be a bank robber and you don't 

13
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:48,691
even have to wear a ski mask and look 
suspicious.

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,670
You just.
This is like a mask that comes with this

15
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,170
fucking this thing

16
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,510
show everybody.
Show everybody.

17
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,970
How does that

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,240
turns into the hood?
It's a hood,

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,230
but it's a mask.
So in these hard economic times,

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,390
why is this?
Is there another version of that window?

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,960
She was the girl that died,
that snored that giant line account.

22
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,600
Really?
I don't really know she died,

23
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:30,610
but people in the Internet you're 
saying,

24
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,000
should I?

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,490
Alright,
what's up bitches?

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,750
How's everybody doing?
We got two things going on here.

27
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,580
We got this,
uh,

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,220
this um,
twitter thing where you can,

29
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:47,130
um,
if you twitter your questions,

30
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:50,850
we'll answer your questions for that.
Or if you go to my website,

31
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:54,330
which is a forums Joe Rogan.net,

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,440
people asking you questions.
God dammit.

33
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:07,180
This one fella?
Yeah,

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,240
he apologized.
That's good.

35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,270
Alright.
What's happened at fuckers?

36
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,430
What's going on?
Can we some questions?

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,600
Some good ones.

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,260
How many bond here tonight?
We haven't taken anything.

39
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,310
Baguettes.
We've only used a little little pipe 

40
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,460
that some of the gaming.
No bond hits bitches.

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,280
Bong hits for Jesus Salads.

42
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,430
John's microphone.
Where I see that it's not really,

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,310
that doesn't do it.
Somebody does it for him,

44
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,590
why he's doing it,
but they're doing a really good job 

45
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,890
getting all the information.
Here's his Christmas dinner was like he 

46
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,100
had Charlie Sheen to talk

47
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:05,100
about.
He had terrorism to talk about how 

48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,100
somehow they connected with each other.

49
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.
He'll probably have some thing.

50
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,680
Well,
Charlie didn't do anything.

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,270
The government doesn't want Charlie out 
there and talking about nine slash 11.

52
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,940
I'm half Joey Diaz.
Half Alan knows that that's too high,

53
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:21,860
ladies and gentlemen,
to to be doing a show.

54
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,980
This is ridiculous.
The weed that they have here in 

55
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,000
California is just too goddamn strong.
Ladies.

56
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,230
Gentlemen.
It's medical.

57
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:32,090
You could just buy it from a fucking 
store.

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,920
Should is outrageous

59
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,880
and it's train wreck.
That's nice.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,730
That's like one of the best scores you 
can get.

61
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,440
I don't like how you guys are looking 
down at me.

62
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,660
Makes for uncomfortable.
I wish we're looking eye to eye on the 

63
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:45,720
same level.
I'm going to have to set this up so that

64
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,810
we're looking at eye.
It feels weird looking time.

65
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,490
Yes,
smart monitor.

66
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,950
I can trade you.
You're so nice.

67
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,360
Question,
question,

68
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,850
question.
Let's go to the Rogan board.

69
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:05,340
We're going to go to two forums,
dot Joe Rogan.to

70
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:10,341
the official 12 slash 29 ustream ustream
podcast thread where the questions are 

71
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:14,050
not limited to a gay 140 characters.
That shit's ridiculous.

72
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,040
Do you think there will be one world 
government in our life or do you think 

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,800
it will act and and how do you think it 
will actually affect us?

74
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,070
I think that's possible.
It's very possible if they can get the 

75
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,321
money sorted out between all these 
fucking scumbags at Ronnie's world 

76
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:28,321
governments.
Yeah.

77
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:30,370
They would all agree to one gigantic 
system of government.

78
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,070
The problem with one gigantic system of 
government it is though,

79
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:35,080
even though it would be harder for 
corruption,

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,320
it will be.
It's also harder to keep people in line 

81
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,320
because you have to have enemies.
You have to have like,

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,840
you know the,
the Turks hate the fucking Iranians hate

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,570
the hate the Vac.
If you don't have that conflict,

84
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,430
it's very difficult to keep people in 
line,

85
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,760
you know?
And if we were all the United States of 

86
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:53,760
America,
then we started arguing about money.

87
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,720
We started arguing about taxes.
We started,

88
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,080
you know,
if we're all one thing,

89
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,110
it makes it very difficult to do,
but as far as like giant international 

90
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,711
banks,
they might already be in cahoots or 

91
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:07,501
close enough to one world government.
I mean there might be a few that are 

92
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:07,780
really pulling the strings and running 
things.

93
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:08,470
But I mean,

94
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,820
yeah,
because the future,

95
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,520
if that government was just the 
Internet,

96
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,580
so if we can be wanting to vote,
it was just like going on a message 

97
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,760
board in voting like hey,
so we have legal insurance vote now.

98
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,120
That would be critical.
Good.

99
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,630
That'd be like for the people.
But then people would hack it.

100
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,690
Yeah.
No,

101
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,810
it's,
it's all good on paper.

102
00:05:24,811 --> 00:05:29,811
But you know,
anything that you do on the Internet 

103
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:29,811
now,
like two to play poker,

104
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:30,240
you never know if you're playing poker 
against a real dude,

105
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,120
you know,
you could easily be playing poker.

106
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,060
It's a computer,
right?

107
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:34,650
I mean I don't know what kind of 
programs they run,

108
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:38,370
but it seems to me like at this point in
time people can hack just about anything

109
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,180
they can.
I mean there's,

110
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,830
there's programs like that's the problem
with these drones.

111
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,040
They have.
You heard about this,

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,160
those drones can actually hacking into 
the drones.

113
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,590
Like the airplanes.
This drones.

114
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,420
I checked the borders and stuff there.
Yeah.

115
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:54,000
Well they don't just check borders.
They launched missiles.

116
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,290
They have these fucking things,
these drones that shoot these called 

117
00:05:59,290 --> 00:05:59,290
Hellfire

118
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,060
missiles and they use them in Pakistan 
and all these places where we're not 

119
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,950
really supposed to bake and they just 
fly in and Jack People.

120
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,130
Well,
the insurgence have figured out how to 

121
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,360
hack the code and actually view the 
Monitor.

122
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,600
It's,
it's crazy shit,

123
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,460
man.
Speaking of crazy shit.

124
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,150
I really do have to say shit.
We plan this out bad.

125
00:06:16,151 --> 00:06:18,230
So I'm going to take a shit and Brian's 
going to answer questions

126
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,190
and that's a $29 program that,
that,

127
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,040
that they use just to hack our videos.
So you ask questions.

128
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:30,041
I'll be asking questions from here to.
There is a toilet in his office.

129
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,440
What is your opinion?
Uh,

130
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,760
that's good.
In fact,

131
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:42,761
at twitter,
Joe doesn't make the extract listerine 

132
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,280
packages.
It's actually one of the products that's

133
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:59,281
sold here in California.
When you have a medical marijuana 

134
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:02,351
license,
you can go to a store and they saw the 

135
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:04,040
listerine at the store.
Like it looks like listerine strips a.

136
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,180
So now he doesn't make them himself.
Joe Has not seen avatar yet.

137
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:14,791
We're the last two people to see Avatar 
and we're supposed to see it this week.

138
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,570
It's pretty annoying.
Not being the last one to see it.

139
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Underwear bomber was staged.
Any thoughts they did from the the 

140
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,150
airplane stage under coverage?
The government man,

141
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,660
the government.
I think he's just a retard.

142
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,210
Joe just thinks he's a retard.

143
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,130
I think it shows you how fragile our 
system is.

144
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Now.
The one guy to do one stupid thing in 

145
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:56,300
the whole world grinds to a halt and 
security.

146
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,010
It takes five hours.
Now

147
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,090
you guys probably didn't hear that,
but he thinks it's pretty ridiculous how

148
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,300
one guy did all of that and that's how 
bad our security is and now our shit's 

149
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,000
all fucked up from that one.
Dig.

150
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,520
Yeah.
Security lines are five hours long,

151
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:09,060
right?

152
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,610
One guy shows you how fragile this 
system knows.

153
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,110
Joel is not.
We're not reading the chat on Ustream.

154
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Joe Is only doing the twitter,
so if you have a message joe answered.

155
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:26,060
If you put on twitter or Joe Rogan's

He's taking a shit right now so he'll be

157
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:36,971

It's the coffee.

158
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,530
Sorry,

159
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,340
Um,
let's see.

160
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:49,341
Let's go back to the.
Alright,

161
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,340
let me go read some messages on chose 
website forum style.

162
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,970
Joe Rogan.net.
Joe would be right back.

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,950
Let's go.
Uh,

164
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,740
almost 300.
Yeah.

165
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,430
I have the dark vader,
a mark Ecko sweatshirt.

166
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,540
Asa.
But yeah,

167
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,490
that Boba Fett wins.
Pretty sweet.

168
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,970
I have realized though.
It's pretty gay when you're by yourself.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,140
Not with friends,
but these sweatshirts.

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,840
There's the Boba Fett.

171
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,380
Is it?
Oh yeah.

172
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,250
You know,
I think Mark Lehman had one of those new

173
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:38,920
war to the UFC.
Mark Layman is a,

174
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,830
he's a comic book nerd and a,
an a,

175
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:46,250
a Jujitsu freeing.
Teaches a lot of guys who fight fighting

176
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:50,870
the world.
Jujitsu.

177
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,790
And he's a,
he's a big video game junkie.

178
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,320
And he had a Boba Fett one on pretty 
dope.

179
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,550
Pretty Dope.
Alright.

180
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,730
Questions?
Questions from the twitter world is my 

181
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:05,730
twitter tweet deck.

182
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,160
I couldn't get to refresh it and I think
it's the API thing against.

183
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,730
You may want to close that and use the 
ustream one only.

184
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:14,930
Okay.
I see it's not closed yet.

185
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,600
Just shut off that

186
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:27,460
right twitter on ustream.
Let's go with the questions here.

187
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:32,461
Bitches.
What am I back in Ireland.

188
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,620
I'm not going to be back in Ireland 
until the UFC back in Ireland.

189
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:41,950
It's not financially feasible for me to 
make those trips without the UFC to the 

190
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:43,550
UK,
but every time I'm there,

191
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,110
if there's a show,
if we're going,

192
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,470
if we're doing a UFC in Ireland for sure
I'll be doing standup comedy there.

193
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,000
They could hear the flesh.
Can you hear me?

194
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,840
Did you want me to take it down?
It was so strong I couldn't resist it.

195
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,030
I knew I had to go.
I didn't want to.

196
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,960
I want to do.
I wanted to be able to just man up and 

197
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,840
push through the whole use dream,
but I was like,

198
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,870
I'm going to do a bad job.
Does I'm just be thinking about this 

199
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:15,870
dump I have to take.
So what was,

200
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,030
what were we talking about before I took
off?

201
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:18,340
Because it was kind of important stuff.

202
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,350
Uh Huh.

203
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,870
I think the one road thing is the last 
thing you talked.

204
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,050
Oh,
that was the first question.

205
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,910
The one world government,
our lifetimes,

206
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,430
I don't know man.
I used to,

207
00:12:32,431 --> 00:12:34,980
I had a lot more faith before Obama got 
elected.

208
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:39,981
I'll tell you that I thought that maybe 
what we had was a corrupt situation and 

209
00:12:39,981 --> 00:12:41,100
you know,
the Bush and Cheney were corrupt in that

210
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,280
if we got somebody else in there,
maybe they could straighten everything 

211
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,280
out.
But after Obama got elected,

212
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,751
man it,
it became pretty clear to me that 

213
00:12:50,751 --> 00:12:52,080
someone else besides the president 
obviously is pulling the strings.

214
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Obama didn't want to send more troops.
Obama didn't want to go to Afghanistan 

215
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,380
to bring more people to Afghanistan and 
he wanted to pull out a Guantanamo Bay,

216
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,060
close Guantanamo Bay,
don't all that shit,

217
00:13:03,061 --> 00:13:08,061
but it's not.
I don't think he gets to say what the 

218
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,900
fuck they do or he was just saying that 
kind of shit to get elected.

219
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,140
You know,
the,

220
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,140
the old Bill Hicks,
Joe comes to mind.

221
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,870
You know that American politics is a,
you know,

222
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,390
I like the puppet on the right.
Well,

223
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:21,360
I find the puppet to the left to be more
to my liking.

224
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,110
Hey,
wait a minute.

225
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:23,610
There's one guy who's holding both 
puppets.

226
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,080
I think it's right.
What are you doing?

227
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,250
Oh,
it's not doing anything.

228
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,340
I'm just.
I know what you're just tracking the 

229
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:31,340
shit you had to hang up on the screen.
Moving shit around.

230
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,040
Fucking psycho.
He's a tweaker but not like the pine.

231
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,940
Mckee has come more to optimize my 
internet's.

232
00:13:38,941 --> 00:13:43,941
He's the kind of due to hacks into his 
registry to make us internet like one 

233
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:43,941
kbh faster.

234
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,180
You're one of those dudes,
right?

235
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:47,110
You remember when computers first came 
out and uh,

236
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,420
do you ever.
I always had,

237
00:13:48,421 --> 00:13:53,421
I had a friend that said that he could 
hack into the library and like get rid 

238
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:53,760
of all the,
do fees and stuff like that.

239
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:54,720
I always wondered if that was real

240
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,700
for my Lego.
Well,

241
00:13:56,701 --> 00:14:01,701
definitely there were some systems that 
you could hack into if you were a 

242
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:01,701
wizard.
You know,

243
00:14:01,701 --> 00:14:04,470
isn't that what nick did a lot of shit 
with like phone calls.

244
00:14:04,471 --> 00:14:07,260
Right.
Did like get information from people.

245
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,270
Like it wasn't even that he was this 
great hacker was just.

246
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,580
She was kind of like a con man.

247
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,920
Tighter way.
Did you read that?

248
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:17,921
They just hacked the like a 21 year old 
code that a ramp that scrambles or phone

249
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:23,510
calls on cell phones so now and the 
guys,

250
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:26,090
the hackers put it on the Internet so 
anyone could have it.

251
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,000
So now,
I mean of course it's probably not going

252
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:34,001
to happen to us anytime soon,
but now there's actually people that 

253
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,691
have the code to that they can listen to
your phone and listen to your phone 

254
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:37,730
calls.
Holy Shit.

255
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,930
Twenty one year old code,
like a 64 bit code.

256
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,440
I think that's where the

257
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,750
just headed to.
I think that's where I think that's the 

258
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,721
future.
The future is there's not going to be 

259
00:14:51,721 --> 00:14:51,760
any private information.
I think what we're seeing with like this

260
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:52,130
tiger

261
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:57,130
woods thing,
I think we're seeing the future of 

262
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,130
things to come.
I mean with him,

263
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,540
it's obviously that he's a celebrity and
it's a.

264
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,180
But the way that everybody is swarming 
after this information.

265
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:03,020
Me Too,
man,

266
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,170
I can't fucking put down and US weekly.
If I see an US weekly at the market and 

267
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,950
there's some new tiger woods information
I grabbed that I can't fucking help it.

268
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,310
You know,
will I think eventually there's not 

269
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,550
gonna be any secrets.
I think eventually we're going to get to

270
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:20,180
a point where the way information is 
being distributed,

271
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:22,580
it's changing the way we feel about 
information.

272
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,000
I mean it's a weird with celebrities.
It's one thing,

273
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,110
you know,
we're looking at it like,

274
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:31,640
well these are famous people and it's 
like they give up that right once,

275
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,850
once you start,
you know,

276
00:15:32,851 --> 00:15:35,510
putting yourself in the public eye,
you give up that right to privacy.

277
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,870
Well eventually that's going to happen.
Like it's happening with facebook 

278
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,751
accounts to like girls are doing stupid 
shit in their facebook accounts and he 

279
00:15:43,751 --> 00:15:44,810
gets all the internet and they go,
well you know she gave up her right when

280
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,890
she put it on facebook.

281
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,360
It's like that new google goggles where 
you can just take a photo of anything 

282
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,370
and it figures out what it is and then 
search is it for you.

283
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,610
So you can now like go to a,
like a VC,

284
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:01,120
like a can of pop can take a picture of 
it and knows what it is.

285
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,080
Google say,
but you can see it starting to get where

286
00:16:03,081 --> 00:16:08,081
you can.
They're going to do it where you can do 

287
00:16:08,081 --> 00:16:09,930
flowers and plants and anything's A.
Pretty soon everything's going to be 

288
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,460
google search,
so there is no privacy.

289
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:15,190
So while I'm here I could,
you know what I mean?

290
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,690
Yeah,
yeah.

291
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,270
I mean eventually I'm sure that shit is 
going to make its way into your house.

292
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,340
Well,
it's already in Google goggles came out 

293
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,340
on the,

294
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,190
you know what I mean?
I mean you'll be able to search 

295
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,190
someone's house,
so yeah,

296
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:28,190
take a photo and you'll be able to go,
oh,

297
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,270
this guy lives at 97 woodcrest road.
People only have

298
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,660
five years ago.
You put a picture on your facebook,

299
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,480
a Christmas photo that has like your 
bookshelf in the background.

300
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Now present day that that's going to 
start researching every single book 

301
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,600
that's on your shelf and it's gonna put 
in a database somewhere and,

302
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,570
and GPS location.
You know what I mean?

303
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:48,320
So like when you're searching for 
something,

304
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:48,880
you could be like,
oh,

305
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,020
Joe has that book at home.

306
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,850
I think what's happening?
I think what's happening with twitter 

307
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,820
and what's happening with facebook and 
what's happening with the just the 

308
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,491
Internet in general is there's way more 
connectivity between all human beings 

309
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:06,440
and a part of that is access to 
information so that information is not 

310
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,660
going to be lucky.
It is now.

311
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:08,160
It's not going to be private,
I think.

312
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:13,161
No,
I think eventually technology will come 

313
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:16,730
to the point where the line will be 
absolutely impossible and you will know 

314
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,421
everything that everybody else knows and
everyone's going to try to hold back on 

315
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:20,550
it for awhile because people have a lot 
of dirty secrets.

316
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,820
They do a lot of creepy shit,
but I think ultimately it's probably 

317
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,151
going to be good for everybody.
I do think that that's where we're 

318
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:31,701
headed.
I think we're headed to a point where 

319
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,441
everybody has access to all the 
information that everybody else has and 

320
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,240
not just like go on the Internet and you
search for it.

321
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,230
Not like in the rudimentary way.
We have to actively look for.

322
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,250
I think it's going to be right there.
I think there's going to eventually 

323
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:44,250
come.
There's gonna.

324
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,530
They're gonna.
Eventually get to a point where there's 

325
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,361
some sort of technology that's created 
that allows human minds interface with 

326
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:54,921
other human minds.
I think that that's definitely where 

327
00:17:54,921 --> 00:17:57,861
this was all going.
I mean when there's talk of neural 

328
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:58,200
implants and all these different things,
people think that's all crazy,

329
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:02,070
but that's.
That's a small step from where we are in

330
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,560
comparison to where we were just a 
couple hundred years ago.

331
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,740
I mean a couple hundred years ago,
the fastest mode of transportation was 

332
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,620
riding a fucking animal.
Think about that.

333
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:15,770
You have to write 300 years ago,
the fastest ship on land is to ride an 

334
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,331
animal or have an animal pull you behind
something with wheels or slave slaves.

335
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:23,340
Can't run as fast as some of those guys 
can.

336
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,630
No Way.
Not a horse.

337
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,940
This guy's an idiot.
I can't believe I'm doing this,

338
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,250
but I mean think about what a Banya 
mental leap between the transference of 

339
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,950
information today in 2009 and in 17.
Oh,

340
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:37,800
nine.
I mean,

341
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:42,060
think about what we can do right now.
We could send a fucking picture across,

342
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,860
you know,
space is,

343
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:46,710
send it through the air and then 
literally arrives.

344
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:51,711
I mean if I have a friend in the UK and 
I want to send him a picture and a text 

345
00:18:51,711 --> 00:18:52,310
message,
I can take the picture,

346
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,830
send it,
and it gets to him just like that.

347
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,230
I mean,
that's fucking incredible.

348
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,660
I mean,
it literally will get there in seconds.

349
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,110
We don't even.
We can't even fathom how nuts that is 

350
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,330
because we do it all the time.
What's coming next is going to make that

351
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,890
seem like riding a horse.

352
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,410
That's what's happening.
That's what I think is happening.

353
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,480
That's what I think is this whole this,
this rush for inflammation and everybody

354
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:22,380
has this insane desire that human beings
have for the newest,

355
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,210
greatest,
latest technology.

356
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,190
You know,
even when you don't need it,

357
00:19:26,191 --> 00:19:28,550
like people are always trying to pump up
their computers.

358
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,570
The only reason why you need a pumped up
computer really is to play video games 

359
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,130
or if you're,
you're crunching a video like,

360
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,160
like he needs stuff like that when he,
when he makes videos just for raw 

361
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,431
computing power.
But the average person does is not 

362
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:43,431
crunching video.

363
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:47,090
You hit a wall.
We've hit a wall and computers in 

364
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:49,221
general,
like they really don't need even like 

365
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,360
the fastest computers now.
The programs that video programs aren't 

366
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:52,360
even.
Yeah.

367
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,070
That's why everybody's into those little
notebooks.

368
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,130
You know,
those notebooks are the shit except for 

369
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,130
watching like hd videos.
Yeah.

370
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,670
That's kind of sucks.
And you can't,

371
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:01,800
you can't load a cd into it either.
A DVD,

372
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,070
right?
Yeah.

373
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,430
But that technologies like talking about
the floppy drive right before the floppy

374
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,170
drive left,
you know,

375
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:11,180
like cds and dvds are out the door.
Even Blu rays have like such a small 

376
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,711
shelf life and you think it's ever going
to get to a point where bandwidth will 

377
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,970
be so broad and like mobile functions 
like laptops and phones,

378
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:22,971
like those little mobile cards,
it'll be so powerful that it will be 

379
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:22,971
just like your home.
Oh,

380
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,471
it's totally.
It's going to be all of that pretty 

381
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:27,471
soon.
So it'll basically be like,

382
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:31,190
everything will be broad man.
Do we even know what the fuck that is 

383
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,430
doing to human beings?
You know,

384
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,390
like the talking about cell phones 
causing radiation and you know,

385
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,700
like when they say it's bad when we say 
it's okay.

386
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Well I think,
do you think that it's possible that 

387
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,940
that's like altering human beings given 
kids autism?

388
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,530
Probably not,
right?

389
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,040
It might be that.
It might be that

390
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:53,160
it might also be fucking with bees.
There's been speculation that it's been 

391
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,070
fucking with bees and there's also been 
speculation that at some,

392
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:59,071
some crazy virus of read that as well.
But there's also been speculation that 

393
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:02,370
Wifi signals and cell phone signals,
they have fucks with b's ability to 

394
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,360
transmit.
We did a thing for fear factor in once 

395
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,390
with bees on it and it was a fucking 
trip because this guy was a beekeeper.

396
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:07,880
Any,
uh,

397
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,900
you know,
I had all these bs that he brought with 

398
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:12,910
him.
So the stunt was these dudes,

399
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:17,911
they had to be strapped to this pole.
We strap them to the pole and then we 

400
00:21:17,911 --> 00:21:18,990
cover them with bs and they have to 
stand there for like five minutes.

401
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,740
Tim Riggins fucked up because every now 
and then,

402
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,330
you know,
the bees were argue or something.

403
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:24,030
They'd sting to dude and it was bad.

404
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,050
I got stung up.
Well while this was all going on and 

405
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,220
while this guy's tendencies,
bees and caring for these bees,

406
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,910
a local swarm of bees came in so our 
bees and their bees,

407
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:38,680
we're talking it out and we had a 
backup.

408
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,080
Everybody had to get off the set.
We had to close down the set.

409
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:46,081
We had to close down the stock and 
everybody had to move back and the 

410
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:46,081
beekeeper say,
and we've got,

411
00:21:46,081 --> 00:21:48,250
you know,
a local local band of bees is moved in.

412
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,130
I forget what he calls him a hive or I 
don't know,

413
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,230
but that's like a no,
I don't know,

414
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:58,231
whatever.
A local band to bees moved into to sort 

415
00:21:58,231 --> 00:22:01,501
it out with these bees.
So our bees and their bees were just 

416
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,190
this fucking swarm in the sky.
And they were fighting.

417
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,100
They were just talking like,
so what's up?

418
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,670
What are you guys do?
And I'll work with your doctor,

419
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:07,960
you know,
working with fear factor.

420
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,120
We've got some dudes are going to cover 
them and bees and shit.

421
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,460
They're like working out what was going 
on.

422
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:17,461
And then they resolved their differences
and the local bees went a separate way 

423
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,370
and then the,
his be stayed.

424
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,930
Was it like a black cloud?
That's correct.

425
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,950
It was not.
It was a big fucking cloud of bees in 

426
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:25,950
the air.
And the bees were communicating.

427
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Where's your cell phone?
Why weren't you filming back is back in 

428
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,020
the day.
He didn't have a [inaudible] no.

429
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,360
Nineteen or whatever role.
We had a press four times to get it as 

430
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,120
bad as little Motorola ea 15.
It was one of those.

431
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,540
But um,
so,

432
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:44,410
uh,
we,

433
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,570
we,
they wonder if that's fucking with bds,

434
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,600
if our cell phone signals and everything
are fucking with beings that autism 

435
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:51,600
thing,
man,

436
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,840
it might be something totally like that.
It also,

437
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:55,330
you know,
a lot of speculation about autism is the

438
00:22:55,331 --> 00:23:00,331
age of the parents and that the women 
are having babies like into their 

439
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:00,910
thirties and forties.
And that increases the risk.

440
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,880
A lot of people talked about that.
That's um,

441
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,590
it's very,
very possible.

442
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,500
Makes Sense,
man.

443
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,640
You know,
when we're just older and smarter and we

444
00:23:09,641 --> 00:23:11,050
look at it now and we say,
well God,

445
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:16,051
you know,
how stupid would it be to have a kid 

446
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:16,051
when you're 18?
When you're 18,

447
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:16,051
you're an idiot,
which is absolutely true,

448
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:20,700
but when you're an 18 year old idiot,
your genetics are much stronger and you 

449
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,321
could,
you could have a kid and the kid 

450
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:25,321
probably wouldn't be as fucked up.
I mean,

451
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:29,760
the reality is even though we're 
lengthening our lifetimes with nutrition

452
00:23:30,461 --> 00:23:35,461
and you know,
science and we're figuring out a way to 

453
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,801
make people live longer,
people aren't supposed to live much 

454
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:37,801
longer than like 50.
You know,

455
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:39,820
back in the day if you lived to be 50,
holy Shit,

456
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:41,110
you pulled off an amazing,

457
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,420
you know,
but not,

458
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,160
not anymore.
Now people

459
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,500
are living to be 110 and you got 
Sylvester.

460
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:50,630
Stallone is 62 years old.
He's flogging,

461
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,740
yoked,
shredded.

462
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,140
You know,
things are getting very strange now.

463
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,440
That's why guys are smart.
They're just knock up 18 year old girls 

464
00:23:59,440 --> 00:23:59,880
when they want to get,
you know,

465
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,870
girls would definitely give you the 
better genetics.

466
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,910
The real question though is do you,
do you get anything other than,

467
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,050
you know,
like hair,

468
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:10,340
color,
eye color,

469
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:14,030
personality,
do you get learned experiences and is it

470
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:17,210
better off to have a parent with a lot 
of experiences?

471
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,420
Are those experiences transfer through 
DNA because they didn't use to think it 

472
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,591
was.
They used to think that ideas were only 

473
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,730
they were native to the person who had 
the idea,

474
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
but now they're starting to think that 
memes can actually be transferred 

475
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,480
through genetics and that useless 
traits.

476
00:24:35,481 --> 00:24:40,481
Even like racism,
racism can be transferred through 

477
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:43,511
genetics and it kind of makes sense 
because there's a lot of things that we 

478
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:47,171
have inside our genetics and our 
instincts that are basically ancient 

479
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:52,160
learned things like for like for 
instances do named Rupert sheldrake.

480
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Rupert sheldrake is this evolutionary 
biologists dude,

481
00:24:56,121 --> 00:25:00,110
and he pointed out that children that 
live in New York City,

482
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:04,100
they don't have dreams about like 
muggers or car accidents.

483
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,480
They have nightmares about monsters,
about scary monsters and the reason they

484
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:13,130
have nightmares about scary monsters is 
because back in our heads,

485
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:18,131
somewhere deep in our DNA,
we remember back when we were like 

486
00:25:18,131 --> 00:25:22,870
monkeys when we were these little apes 
hanging around and trees and you're 

487
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,281
running away from big cats and that,
that shit is always in our head because 

488
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:31,661
that is the number one thing that,
what was that fed off of,

489
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,940
uh,
off chimps and apes is his big cats.

490
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:37,520
Big Cats are constantly killing monkeys 
and chimps and apes.

491
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,120
And that's like when they find like old 
human beings,

492
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:41,840
like,
you know,

493
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,340
the,
the,

494
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,510
you know,
evolutionary versions of human beings,

495
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,190
subhuman,
humanoids,

496
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,390
they find all their skeletons,
like a lot of them have like big fucking

497
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,000
cat bites,
big markings.

498
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:58,150
So that's like,
that's like some memory that we have 

499
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,150
ingrained in our,
in our genetics,

500
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,240
you know,
whoever the fuck we are.

501
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,840
It's very possible that if you're 18 
years old and you know,

502
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:03,980
you have,
you fuck a chicken,

503
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:06,290
she's 18 year both retarded.
You gotTa,

504
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,760
you gotTa have a dumb ass kid,
you know,

505
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,820
I mean that might be,
it might not just be,

506
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:16,180
you know,
your hair color and your eye color and 

507
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,011
how tall you're going to be.
It might be your actual experiences and 

508
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:18,020
your human potential.
Second.

509
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,130
Yeah,
maybe.

510
00:26:19,131 --> 00:26:20,150
Yeah,
yeah.

511
00:26:20,151 --> 00:26:23,150
Maybe if you're a loser,
like if you're a fucking drunk,

512
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:28,151
if you get hammered and you're fucked up
and your life is in the toilet and you 

513
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:28,870
know,
you bang some chick because you know,

514
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,110
on the rebound and her old boyfriend 
used to beat her and you shoot a load in

515
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:38,111
her.
Maybe a kid would be just like really 

516
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:38,111
fucking dumb and prone to make terrible 
mistakes.

517
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,830
You know,
I mean maybe you can get past it,

518
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,220
but maybe his inclination like maybe 
maybe we start off

519
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,280
in a certain place in life,
not just based on the economic situation

520
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:54,381
that our parents are in and you know,
who the people we grow up with and what 

521
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:56,700
our agenda.
Maybe it's maybe it's our,

522
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,840
our,
our position starts out based on what 

523
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,280
the parents were thinking and doing when
they fucked and conceived you like maybe

524
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:07,590
if that's the lowest point in their 
life,

525
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,900
you not even because of the way they 
raised you,

526
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:14,901
they can take you away and raise you in 
an orphanage somewhere totally 

527
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:18,111
different,
but your potential is limited by the 

528
00:27:18,111 --> 00:27:19,320
circumstances in which you were 
conceived.

529
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,780
You think that's possible?
Maybe.

530
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:25,590
I don't think we have any idea.
So I think anything's possible,

531
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:30,591
you know,
but it's very obvious that there's a 

532
00:27:30,591 --> 00:27:31,290
bunch of different types of humans.
There's like super powerful,

533
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:36,291
super successful,
super smart humans and there's really 

534
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:38,400
fucking dumb people because the 
percentage of your brain being used,

535
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,530
you know,
I think people use more brain than other

536
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:43,230
people and I think it's such a small 
percentage,

537
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:44,920
but even that,
you know,

538
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,060
maybe that's the real way to become a 
superhero.

539
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,050
Find out how to use a 100 percent of 
your brain.

540
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,330
But it's bullshit.
I have heard that.

541
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,900
That's bullshit that we don't use it.
Yeah.

542
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,190
I mean when they look it up and it shows
the.

543
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,710
Yeah.
But that,

544
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,020
that's not what that part is for.
You know,

545
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:03,150
I think that that whole,
you know,

546
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:05,070
human beings only used 10 percent of 
their brain.

547
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,150
I think that's a myth.
Well,

548
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,220
they don't know exactly what every part 
of the brain is for.

549
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,680
It's like they're still like,
it's like,

550
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,990
you know,
it's like charting out the bottom of the

551
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:17,640
sea.
There's a lot of shit they still haven't

552
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:20,400
figured out yet.
Let's see if any,

553
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:25,401
you motherfuckers are smarter than us 
and have answers to all these things 

554
00:28:25,401 --> 00:28:28,371
that we're talking about.
It is weird when you see like a human 

555
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:30,951
brain on TV and you're just like,
that's somebody that's a person to 

556
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:31,770
person.
It's crazy.

557
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,570
It doesn't make any sense.
It's nuts.

558
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:36,690
Just twitter is blowing the fuck up.
Ladies and gentle.

559
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,380
No,
he's about twitter around.

560
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,590
I spoke twitter on twitter,
backslash Joe Rogan.

561
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,760
Oh,
it did

562
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:44,830
retired

563
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,250
shit.
Fix that.

564
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,300
No.
Who Cares?

565
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,290
You know,

566
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,320
I'm talking about question.

567
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,310
She watched a scanner darkly.
Yeah.

568
00:28:58,311 --> 00:28:59,060
You know what,
man?

569
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:02,570
A scanner darkly is something that I 
bought a long ass time ago.

570
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:05,390
I got it on DVD and I just have never 
gotten around to watching it.

571
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,120
I tried to watch it.
I stopped anti Chris.

572
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,920
Why?
Why did you stop?

573
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,790
I remember it just wasn't that 
interesting to hear that shit.

574
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:16,120
Chris motherfuckers said it wasn't 
interesting.

575
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,220
You're recommending it and his.
He saying it's whack.

576
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,210
Canneries.
Canneries is tough.

577
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:28,211
Action.
Is there ever been a guy that more 

578
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:30,620
universally panned as an actor but more 
incredibly successful?

579
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,460
There's no.
I mean he like it.

580
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,830
He,
he blows them off the fucking charts 

581
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,830
slipped by every time.
Oh,

582
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,830
here's something that I needed to take 
a.

583
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:42,460
They actually found.
I had a article this month

584
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:47,490
that there was a roadhouse video game in
the being made a few years ago,

585
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,880
but the company went bankrupt.

586
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,090
Roadhouse video game,
the Patrick swayze.

587
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,300
That's the greatest bad movie ever.
It's right up there with showgirls.

588
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,090
If you haven't seen roadhouse,
I don't know what the fuck is wrong with

589
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,740
you.
If you haven't seen showgirls,

590
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,920
drop this chat and and either download 
it or go to the video store and do 

591
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:09,270
something.
You got to watch showgirls.

592
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:14,330
Showgirls was awesome.
Just a quintessential movie where the 

593
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:18,020
people who are doing the movie where 
were just gapped out of their fucking 

594
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,950
minds on cocaine and they made a 
terrible movie.

595
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,940
That makes no sense and it's so bad that
it's good.

596
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:28,941
It's perfect.
It's just one of those movies that's 

597
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:31,701
just perfectly crosses over into parody 
to the point where you could watch it 

598
00:30:31,701 --> 00:30:33,150
over and over and over again.
Right.

599
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,330
I've only seen it twice.
Showgirls was awesome,

600
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,210
but showgirls and roadhouse or both,
basically the same movie,

601
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:46,800
both movies where it's like they got 
people that were just full of themselves

602
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:51,801
enough and just underestimating the 
intelligence of viewers enough and just 

603
00:30:52,171 --> 00:30:54,570
hack enough and just,
you know,

604
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,600
they just follow the dumbest formula 
lines possible and the difference 

605
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,861
between roadhouse and showgirls.
Doe is a roadhouse seems to be raw 

606
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:07,971
stupidity on its own.
Whereas showgirls is the most obvious 

607
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:10,710
cocaine movie of all time because it's 
just so dumb.

608
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,350
Like you had to be on coke.
They think that that was a good movie.

609
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,990
Like if you.
If you made that move and you weren't on

610
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:17,600
coke,
you would watch the dailies.

611
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,420
You'd be like,
what?

612
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:20,010
The fuck we going,
what are we doing?

613
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,810
What is this moving?
But if you're on call you're like,

614
00:31:21,811 --> 00:31:23,280
yeah,
it's fucking awesome.

615
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,180
Coming into the line.

616
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,760
And what was your,

617
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,090
what's your bit.
I'll tell you escalator,

618
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,680
which one has something to do with like,
would you even be able to see it yet?

619
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,990
Because you know,
the human brain hasn't seen it yet.

620
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,780
Oh No,
it was my theory about,

621
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,610
about how we believe that everything 
around us is everything through his.

622
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Right.
And I talk about farts and what I say is

623
00:31:50,641 --> 00:31:53,160
that if someone farted and you didn't 
have a nose,

624
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,730
you'd have no idea if something was.

625
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,240
Oh No,
no.

626
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:56,880
I'm talking about something you used to 
say while ago,

627
00:31:56,890 --> 00:32:00,430
something like kind of you were kind of 
saying like how cars are.

628
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,740
Would you even be able to see it?
Uh,

629
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,040
uh,
because our brain hasn't seen it yet.

630
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:06,820
Like the tiger

631
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,230
or something like that.
Would that added on the tiger bit was if

632
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:12,610
a tiger was running at you,
would you be able to even watch that?

633
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:13,810
Because I think you bring,
just start

634
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,880
producing cyclist pyramids or something.
They used to have a thing where you 

635
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,121
talked about like a,
would they even be able to see it 

636
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:22,130
because their brains never seen it 
before.

637
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,940
And so,
um,

638
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,310
I think so man,
that's on my act.

639
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,550
That's um,
I think you're thinking of there's a 

640
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,280
part in the movie the secret where those
retards claim that or was it,

641
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,500
what the bleep do we know?
I think it was like looking at,

642
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,510
like they said,
the Indians couldn't recognize the 

643
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:39,510
Bolus,
but if I see it,

644
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:39,510
it was not my act now,
my,

645
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,360
my actors,
the,

646
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:45,361
the part about how if we didn't have a 
nose and you smell a Fart,

647
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,390
and this is for the people that are 
watching this,

648
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:52,750
this is the idea is that we don't have 
any idea if there's more around us all 

649
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:56,390
the time that we can't sense.
And it's very possible that there is.

650
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,540
And what I say is the fourth theory and 
the theory is if someone farted and you 

651
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,591
couldn't smell it,
you'd have no idea that there's 

652
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:05,591
something around you.

653
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:07,780
It's totally completely invisible.
But if someone farts you fucking smell 

654
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,330
it.
But if you didn't have a nose,

655
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:10,460
you'd be just sitting in someone's 
stench.

656
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,330
How do we not know that there aren't an 
infinite amount of things that we just 

657
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,910
can't detect and that smell,
even though we can attack this,

658
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,490
it's for biological reasons.
You know,

659
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,460
you smell gas,
you know it's dangerous for you.

660
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:22,760
You smell fire,
get away.

661
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,370
There's a reason why we have a sense of 
smell.

662
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:27,380
It's good for us,
but what if we didn't?

663
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:32,770
If we didn't,
it would be an invisible thing and it's 

664
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,461
just our imagination that limits the 
possibilities of how many other 

665
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:39,350
invisible things there are around us all
the time that we can't detect.

666
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,010
There's all sorts of animals like worms.
You take your hand and he rolled over or

667
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,470
above a where they have no idea they're.

668
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:50,530
They have no idea.
It's very possible that if that exists 

669
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,801
in nature,
that there's also some shit like that 

670
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,820
with human beings.
It's very possible that we're constantly

671
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,040
like the idea of dimensions.
Dimensions might be dimensions of 

672
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,271
perception.
We just might not have the ability to 

673
00:34:04,271 --> 00:34:04,370
perceive all these other things that are
around us all the time.

674
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,320
I mean,
that could be like bad energy,

675
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:07,720
like you go into a house,
I mean people,

676
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,820
many people have told stories or if you 
go into a house where people have been 

677
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,431
murdered and they could feel it,
I could feel fucked up energy in the 

678
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:15,500
house.
Like that all might be real shit.

679
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,530
You know,
like we don't have a name for it and 

680
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:20,530
we're not good at detecting it and you 
know,

681
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,140
we,
we call it a sense or a feeling that 

682
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,200
might be real energy that you're 
detecting.

683
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,380
We're just not evolved enough to the 
point where we can really tune into it 

684
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:29,380
yet.

685
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,630
Why is it that we like our smuggler and 
farts but not somebody else's fired.

686
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,610
My farts are delicious.
Do you think it's just like,

687
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,640
oh no.
Do you think we would enjoy it if we 

688
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:41,640
made herself,
you know,

689
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:44,090
like if you forced yourself to smell my 
heart and enjoy it,

690
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,290
like make yourself into it.
You'd have to be one of those sick dudes

691
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,610
that wax off to Fart porn.
You know,

692
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,940
because there's dudes that do that.
There's dudes,

693
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,870
there's dudes that like that that's 
real.

694
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,050
But I've never heard of anybody who 
likes their buddies fartsy.

695
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,080
That's weird though.
Crazy.

696
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,660
Meanwhile,
I enjoy my own farm.

697
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,090
I love my phone.
Everybody does.

698
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,980
If you're in your car and you feel a hot
one and a blast,

699
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,180
you when you do this.
He stopped smoking.

700
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:15,390
When I'm in the shower,
I cut my hand around my ass.

701
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,230
I call it the Donald Duck because it 
makes it donald duck noise when you.

702
00:35:20,231 --> 00:35:24,850
And when I fart and it doesn't smell,
I'm always disappointed by far nothing.

703
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,260
It's worse.
Yeah.

704
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:29,140
But like if somebody else farts like on 
a plane and you're like,

705
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,350
oh you mother Fucker,
I can't believe you did that,

706
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:34,260
then we should love it.
You know?

707
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,610
And it smells the same.
It's not like your farts smell different

708
00:35:36,611 --> 00:35:37,410
than mine.
What?

709
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Well,
with our farts I think we get a little 

710
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,500
reward.
Like,

711
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Oh,
you're getting all this bad stuff out of

712
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,310
your body.
But with other people's farts it's like,

713
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,150
oh,
you stinky,

714
00:35:45,151 --> 00:35:45,860
fuck.
You know,

715
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,650
it's not the same reward.
Is there any other smells that do that?

716
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,830
I don't like to smell my shit.
I don't like that.

717
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,980
I tell you that I don't like that when I
take a nasty dump on,

718
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,600
Oh,
get me out of that room.

719
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,840
I don't want to go back in.
Like I would blow my nose or something 

720
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840
like that and go to get some totally 
different.

721
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:02,840
Oh,
what the fuck?

722
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,490
That was my shit.
Yeah.

723
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,340
I don't like it,
but I do.

724
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,560
That's funny man.
You do like if you have ever had to shit

725
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,420
outside Iraq to take a ship in the 
woods,

726
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,610
that's the worst because there's no 
water.

727
00:36:11,611 --> 00:36:15,120
I think it's just just steamy,
stinky fucking dump on dirt.

728
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:17,040
Yeah.
The smells horrible.

729
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,980
Nobody ever liked.
It's like sitting there sniffing their,

730
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,820
their pile of Shit and getting all happy
about it.

731
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,370
It makes no sense.
It doesn't make any sense.

732
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,250
It's like what is,
what is the evolutionary reason for that

733
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:33,860
was the reason.
It's probably like the cure of aids 

734
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,801
somewhere in that something that 
researchers are going to research on 

735
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:35,960
farts.
Lily,

736
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,620
you think,
okay,

737
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,890
what do you think about all these dudes?

738
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:40,980
And there's a bunch of scientists online
like um,

739
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,550
uh,
what,

740
00:36:41,551 --> 00:36:46,551
what does that,
there's just one guy that's at the head 

741
00:36:46,551 --> 00:36:46,551
of the cause,
uh,

742
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,590
Peter Duesberg and they're all saying 
that HIV does not cause aids and that 

743
00:36:52,191 --> 00:36:57,191
HIV is a very weak virus and that the 
only reason why HIV exists in the 

744
00:36:57,191 --> 00:36:59,910
systems of these people that are,
have aids is because their immune system

745
00:36:59,911 --> 00:37:02,250
is so compromised that it can even kill 
off HIV.

746
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,650
Well,
I think it's really weird that most of 

747
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,081
the people,
it seems like that have aids are drug 

748
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:10,081
users and gaze.
So they're going to have a.

749
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,440
d has something to do with the immune 
system,

750
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:13,270
but then you get fucking,
what's his name?

751
00:37:13,271 --> 00:37:15,370
The basketball player that had fake 
aides.

752
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,500
That's the other thing is that people 
test negative after a while,

753
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,540
like in the,
they're the Richard he goes into and 

754
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,540
then it goes into,
in,

755
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,330
into a dormant stage,
mean magic Johnson has aids and now he's

756
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,070
doing like mattress commercial,
you know,

757
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,390
like crazy.

758
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,630
Why didn't you have a mattress?
Commercials.

759
00:37:32,631 --> 00:37:36,550
He didn't get a lot of money on AIDS 
medicine.

760
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,840
Yeah,
I think,

761
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,510
I don't know man,
I guess.

762
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,530
I mean they probably pay him millions of
dollars.

763
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:43,630
Do any commercial.
He's still got a good name.

764
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,430
How much mattresses though are you going
to sell it as?

765
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,140
Payback?
What have you,

766
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,230
how many?
Like how many more of these basketball 

767
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,661
players,
all these dudes who you know are out 

768
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:55,180
there just fucking banging chicks left 
and right.

769
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,880
They must be freaking out about this 
tiger woods shit.

770
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,280
Who's target?
What?

771
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:04,281
Shit.
We'll throw a monkey wrench into your 

772
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:04,540
endorsement deals and if you're like a 
Michael Jordan type of dude,

773
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,090
like that's where those guys make them 
the most,

774
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,420
the bulk of their cash as in 
endorsements,

775
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,470
you know,
that's why this is so dangerous to tiger

776
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:16,471
woods.
It's not the tiger woods can't go out 

777
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:16,471
there and still kick your ass and golf 
and say fuck you.

778
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:18,010
I can do whatever I want.
He can,

779
00:38:18,011 --> 00:38:21,610
but he can't because the endorsements is
where he gets all his cash.

780
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,530
We'll look at letterman.
Same thing.

781
00:38:23,531 --> 00:38:26,500
It's like blown up this year.
Two thousand and nine cents.

782
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,900
No,
it doesn't suck.

783
00:38:27,901 --> 00:38:31,140
It's what I was talking about before.
I think what we're sensing,

784
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,230
what we're seeing in celebrities is 
mirrored,

785
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,130
is going to be mirrored as human beings.

786
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,870
We're seeing more access to information.
We're seeing less secrets.

787
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,850
I think it's a trend.
I think it's.

788
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:47,851
It's a.
it's a trend because I think that's 

789
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:47,851
eventually what the human race is going 
to come to.

790
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:52,320
It's going to come to a point in time 
where there was not going to be any 

791
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,271
secrets and that's a good thing.
There's going to be full information 

792
00:38:54,271 --> 00:38:55,840
disclosed from you to me and everything,
and what it is is the convergence of all

793
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:57,690
human beings.
That's what's gonna.

794
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,730
That's what's going to start to ignite 
the convergence amongst all human 

795
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:07,261
beings.
There's going to be full access to 

796
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:07,261
information.
I know everything in your head.

797
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:07,990
You know everything in my head.
It's pretty weird,

798
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:12,991
man.
It's pretty fucking crazy and that's 

799
00:39:12,991 --> 00:39:14,671
where it's going.
It's going through technology and this 

800
00:39:14,671 --> 00:39:15,550
is what the Internet about is what 
twitter is about.

801
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:17,140
This with this huge stream,
trout is about,

802
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,550
this is what all the shit is about.

803
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:23,670
It's about a convergence of human beings
like human beings are eventually merging

804
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,880
into one thing.
I mean,

805
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:29,881
that's the,
the whole ancient line and eastern 

806
00:39:29,881 --> 00:39:30,160
mysticism and each eastern religion is,
you know,

807
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,600
that we are all one.
We are,

808
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:33,910
you know,
we are one consciousness,

809
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,500
like the bill Hicks Joke,
uh,

810
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,630
experiencing itself subjectively.
You know,

811
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:38,240
that's the,
the,

812
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,350
the Timothy leary ideology,
the ideology of all the,

813
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,800
all the psychedelic heads,
all the people that you know,

814
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,920
they really got into like heavy duty 
psychedelic trucks is that it's this one

815
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:52,921
thing and that we can't recognize that 
we're one thing because we have ego and 

816
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:53,860
we have survival and we have all these 
things,

817
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:58,750
but that our technology and the 
technology forcing us to evolve that the

818
00:39:58,751 --> 00:40:03,751
access to information that technology 
provides eventually will cause human 

819
00:40:03,751 --> 00:40:06,580
beings all human beings to converge and 
literally be like one consciousness.

820
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,730
If I know all your thoughts,
I know all your information and we have 

821
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:14,881
an access to it,
an interface that's much less crew than 

822
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:16,210
what we have now with typing and with 
researching or watching documentaries,

823
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:20,090
what if it's like an instant access,
a human neuro transplant,

824
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,860
something that allows all of us to link 
up our minds together.

825
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,560
That's not that outside of the realm of 
possibility.

826
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:31,950
That to me seems just as likely as the 
ability to send a picture through the 

827
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:33,400
Internet on your phone.
That's just.

828
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,430
That's just as fucking crazy that you 
can send video through the air and you 

829
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:40,240
could watch a youtube video on your 
iphone.

830
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,440
You're like,
what the fuck?

831
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,510
I mean,
it's just coming through the air and you

832
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:48,511
put the headphones on and it's in stereo
like wax that's going through the 

833
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:52,741
fucking.
Scott is just as likely that human 

834
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,250
beings are eventually going to come to 
some sort of a,

835
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,280
some sort of a technological invention,
something that we're going to come to 

836
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,240
something that allows all human beings 
to interface together.

837
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,240
It might be through this thing.
It might be something you put on and 

838
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,001
everybody else that has it all links in 
together or it might've actually become 

839
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:13,170
something that you put in your body or 
it might be something they broadcast 

840
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:13,180
through the fucking air that links 
people together.

841
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,740
I can't,
I just can't wait till it gets cheaper 

842
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:19,740
to be able to like upgrade your body 
parts.

843
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,400
Like I want to have better items because
I want night vision.

844
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:23,850
I want to have fucking twitter.
I want.

845
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,380
I knew about that woman that they made 
her a new bladder.

846
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,800
Yeah.
They might have a bladder out of her.

847
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,740
They took her on bladder.
They scrape the cells together since the

848
00:41:32,741 --> 00:41:33,230
group.
Yeah,

849
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,040
they grew up.
So

850
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,280
I don't know if the stem cells,
stem cells,

851
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:41,770
but they,
I know they grew a new bladder for her 

852
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:41,770
and a fucking petri dish and then 
install it in their body.

853
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:41,960
That's crazy.

854
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,690
You know,
a bladder just to kind of a bag for pis.

855
00:41:45,691 --> 00:41:50,691
But that's,
that's going to happen with other shit 

856
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:50,691
too.
Man.

857
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,880
I transplants are crazy too though.
That's amazing.

858
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,290
You like imagine a Jessica.
Uh,

859
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,240
my friends,
uh,

860
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,540
uh,
uncle died and they donated their eyes 

861
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,580
and how help somebody see that canal 
street and they got a letter just to let

862
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:08,581
you know your,
your uncle's eyes were donated to 

863
00:42:08,581 --> 00:42:08,850
so-and-so person who can now see and 
they get,

864
00:42:08,851 --> 00:42:13,851
send them a whole letter.
So you can imagine somebody you know 

865
00:42:13,851 --> 00:42:14,860
who's dead now,
but their eyeballs are still being used.

866
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,960
That's incredible.
That's like a nightmare.

867
00:42:16,961 --> 00:42:18,250
And that's like a horror movie,
right?

868
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:18,890
Like,
well,

869
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,090
I heard about.
So her,

870
00:42:20,091 --> 00:42:25,091
I was thinking I was listening to the 
art bell show about some lady who 

871
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:25,091
donated her.
Uh,

872
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:30,250
she,
she got a liver from someone and the 

873
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,281
operation and right immediately after 
the operation she started having 

874
00:42:32,281 --> 00:42:34,270
cravings for what?
Of those duties are you serious?

875
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,850
That's fucked up craving.
She never had before.

876
00:42:36,851 --> 00:42:37,410
And then she found out,

877
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:42,450
dude,
like really like to eat this certain 

878
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:42,450
type of thing.

879
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,530
First trench.
I wonder if you got a but transplant if 

880
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,050
you'd like that person's farts.
If you'd like your own farts still,

881
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:47,700
if you got somebody else's book,

882
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,050
people might ask the weirdest questions.
Dawkins 20.

883
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:55,370
Look,
this bill Hicks,

884
00:42:55,371 --> 00:42:58,010
the comedian,
how are they the same guy?

885
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,640
What the fuck kind of question is,
uh,

886
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,160
what,
what does that mean?

887
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:05,420
That doesn't mean anything.
That's another.

888
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,190
How are they the same guy?
There's one guy,

889
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,450
he's.
How are they?

890
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:13,451
The same guy.
What Alex Jones is built here because 

891
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,030
this is people believe Alex Jones 
believes I met Bill Hicks.

892
00:43:18,031 --> 00:43:20,220
I'm friends with Alex Jones.
They're not same guy.

893
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,840
Retarded that these people cannot be 
serious.

894
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,030
Just has to be a joke.
It's an Internet meme,

895
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,250
right?
If they're being.

896
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,750
If you guys are being serious about 
that,

897
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:29,950
you guys are fucking retarded.

898
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,420
Yeah.
That's pretty.

899
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:35,370
So.
Alright,

900
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:40,430
let's go some questions here.
Magic Johnson's bought the cure for 

901
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:40,430
aids.
Yeah.

902
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,300
Magic Johnson.
Great South Park.

903
00:43:42,301 --> 00:43:45,980
Episode two was more about that.
The cure for years.

904
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,540
No better south park episode than the 
one where the,

905
00:43:48,541 --> 00:43:51,740
uh,
the gay dude had a horror off with Paris

906
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,470
shelter up.
I remember watching that going.

907
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,500
How do they get away with this?
You don't pass on circumstances,

908
00:44:02,321 --> 00:44:05,680
but you can pass on the psychic ability 
to create them.

909
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,180
Alright.
Alright.

910
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,240
Christine and they.
Liz,

911
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,850
how do you know that?
Do you really know that?

912
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:16,150
Are you just saying maybe,
maybe that's what's happening,

913
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,030
but you don't know the psychic ability 
to create them.

914
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:26,300
Have you ever met anybody that says that
they're a channeler or says that they're

915
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:28,340
savvy?
That isn't a fucking retard.

916
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,270
Have you ever met anyone?

917
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,010
I don't believe any of that.
Every time they do it like fucking scam

918
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
artists to me.
I've never met one person that says 

919
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:37,740
they're a psychic or says they can 
channel that isn't retarded.

920
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:40,500
They're all retarded,
but then it's almost like,

921
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:42,330
do you have to be retarded to be able to
do that?

922
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,510
Like maybe you have to be like,
like some somewhat of a person that can 

923
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,660
look like you're.
You're so socially inept.

924
00:44:49,661 --> 00:44:51,630
You're so clueless as to how other 
people perceive you,

925
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,630
that you can achieve certain frequencies
that other people can't.

926
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,480
Is that possible?
Anything?

927
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,330
Can I get Alex Jones on opiod?
Anthony?

928
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,380
I don't think so,
man.

929
00:45:03,381 --> 00:45:06,170
I don't think that's a good idea.
I saw a little jimmy little.

930
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:09,050
Jimmy did the Jesse Ventura.
I don't think we'd like that.

931
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,730
Alex Jones is not the kind of guy you're
supposed to like argue with like that.

932
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:17,660
You're supposed to enjoy his company and
ask them questions.

933
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,620
And then we started talking about new 
world order,

934
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,380
black helicopters,
legend gentleman.

935
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,900
I see them outside of my window every 
night you tell me I'm crazy,

936
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,170
but I see black helicopters outside my 
window.

937
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,420
So what is going on?
You don't argue with that dude.

938
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,480
You go damn man,
motherfucking black helicopters that's 

939
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:37,480
supposed to do.
And that's supposed to like.

940
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,150
And I think if,
if I was in the room with Jesse Ventura,

941
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,730
I'm certain I would have handled it 
different than Jimmy did,

942
00:45:43,731 --> 00:45:46,400
but Jimmy's one of those dudes were Jim 
Norton,

943
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,030
fantastic comedian,
funniest guy in radio without a doubt by

944
00:45:50,031 --> 00:45:50,510
far.

945
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:53,690
He,
he's one of those dudes that when he,

946
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:54,890
um,
you know,

947
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,050
when he's in the face of someone who's 
like a bully,

948
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,690
he doesn't like that shit.
He doesn't stand up to that shit.

949
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:04,691
Well,
and he feels like that Jesse has this 

950
00:46:04,691 --> 00:46:07,481
slow burn in his eyes and the Imo navy 
seal and all that shit and that you're 

951
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:08,240
supposed to listen to them because of 
that.

952
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,770
And Jim Norton just ain't buying that 
and that's why Jimmy just shut them down

953
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,150
and clowned him.
That's just what he does.

954
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,760
He's just,
he's not good at people being bullies.

955
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,110
A respect that

956
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:26,390
people that meditate have large frontal 
lobe cortex is studies.

957
00:46:26,391 --> 00:46:29,960
Show says Pete Shreds.
I wonder.

958
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:31,280
That's very possible,
right?

959
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:35,300
It's very possible that it changes the 
way your brain works.

960
00:46:35,301 --> 00:46:36,380
I mean,
if you lift weights,

961
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,300
you know it changes the way your 
muscles.

962
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:39,320
Look.
If you,

963
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:42,200
if you exercise your mind in certain 
ways,

964
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:47,230
if this doesn't make that happen,
Brian is going to smoke marijuana live 

965
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,670
right here on ustream.
Thank God it's all legal.

966
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,030
Supposedly.
That's the only thing Obama's done.

967
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,600
He said he would do stuff on after we'd 
rediculus alright,

968
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,680
what else?
What else?

969
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:08,681
Party people.
Let's go to the Rogan board and read 

970
00:47:08,681 --> 00:47:09,770
some of the questions that you find 
people have.

971
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,940
What is my opinion on freewill?
Your blog talks about how we're all 

972
00:47:17,981 --> 00:47:21,070
living through different circumstances,
which is very true,

973
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,930
but it seems.
Do you know what the power of free will,

974
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:26,090
which kind of sucks.
No.

975
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,730
Know I go,
I start about freewill.

976
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,050
I

977
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,750
think about free will and a couple of 
different ways.

978
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:36,751
I think it's very possible that you know
you are shaping your own destiny and 

979
00:47:36,751 --> 00:47:37,570
that you know,
you can,

980
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,820
you know,
choose your path and you can,

981
00:47:39,821 --> 00:47:41,950
you know,
go through this life and you know,

982
00:47:41,951 --> 00:47:43,720
and make something of yourself and you 
know,

983
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:46,300
the fact that you did it by yourself and
you have through freewill.

984
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,670
It's all good.
I think that's very possible,

985
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:54,120
but I think it's all pos.
It's also possible that life itself is a

986
00:47:54,401 --> 00:47:59,401
gigantic mathematical algorithm that all
life itself is like a gigantic 

987
00:48:00,941 --> 00:48:05,941
mathematical equation and that it just 
doesn't seem like an equation because 

988
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:08,680
we're a part of it,
but like that,

989
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,630
everything,
your personality,

990
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:13,450
your biology,
your circumstances,

991
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,070
your experiences,
they're all set up in line to put you in

992
00:48:18,071 --> 00:48:23,071
a very specific position to move forward
in a very specific way to interface with

993
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:23,800
all the other.

994
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,390
Very specific things that are around 
you,

995
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:30,600
all the other very specific people,
very specific events and that the idea 

996
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,551
is that what the idea of free will is 
sort of a misnomer.

997
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:39,961
Like you have instincts and you have 
experiences that guide you into a 

998
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:40,620
certain way,
like say if you,

999
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:41,780
uh,
you know,

1000
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:46,990
he drank poison,
you almost died and it was terrible and 

1001
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:46,990
he didn't know it was poison.
Well,

1002
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,270
you'll be much more careful next time 
and you won't drink poison.

1003
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:54,040
The idea that that circumstance that 
you've experienced as lead you taught in

1004
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:59,041
a very specific way and that you are 
experiences literally are set up as a 

1005
00:48:59,471 --> 00:49:04,471
part of a mathematical equation and that
it's all to lead this entire human race,

1006
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,240
which is really just one organism,
one gigantic super organism to lead this

1007
00:49:10,241 --> 00:49:14,230
entire human race into a specific place 
for a very specific purpose.

1008
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:16,150
That's possible.
You know,

1009
00:49:16,151 --> 00:49:17,740
I don't like the thinking.
You know,

1010
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,910
when your ego has any control whatsoever
over your mind.

1011
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:24,160
Your ego wants you to think that no,
you know,

1012
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,900
I am in control of my own,
my life.

1013
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:30,930
I have done what I've done and I'm proud
of all that I've done because it's my 

1014
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:35,221
own accomplishments,
but really it might be you're following 

1015
00:49:35,221 --> 00:49:36,040
a program.
It really might be.

1016
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:38,680
We're all a part of this gigantic 
program that's,

1017
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:40,540
you know,
and that all this,

1018
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:43,270
you know,
ego justification,

1019
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:48,271
ego gratification,
sex and love and fun and happiness and 

1020
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,280
all these things are really just like 
numbers and equations and like the 

1021
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,600
little,
the powerful number that you get from 

1022
00:49:59,600 --> 00:49:59,600
love forces you to,
you know,

1023
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,690
to be in love and have children and to 
create more people and to be good to 

1024
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,320
those people and those people create 
more good people and that,

1025
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:10,321
these,
these rewards are all in fact set up as 

1026
00:50:10,321 --> 00:50:13,741
a part of an equation to move the human 
race into one specific place that 

1027
00:50:13,741 --> 00:50:16,670
everyone is working together all over 
the world and we just don't realize it.

1028
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,190
We're beings.
Yeah,

1029
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:19,720
we're bs.
I mean like when,

1030
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:22,270
I mean we don't know how bees 
communicate.

1031
00:50:22,271 --> 00:50:24,740
We don't know what,
what sort of a culture bees have,

1032
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,890
but we know that they don't have books.
They can't their past.

1033
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,200
They can't study their history.
I mean how conscious,

1034
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:35,201
how aware are they in?
Are they just going through the motions 

1035
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:35,450
because that's how they're programmed 
and if,

1036
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,410
if that's the case,
if that's the case with wolves and bears

1037
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,730
and every other animal that sort of goes
through these natural motions to achieve

1038
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:46,250
a specific result,
maybe that's what we're doing.

1039
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,400
Maybe we're just doing it and it's way 
more complicated because what we're 

1040
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:51,830
doing is we're actually changing our 
environment.

1041
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:56,831
We're changing the world.
We're creating computers and creating 

1042
00:50:56,831 --> 00:50:59,951
technology and we're involved.
We're the only animal on the planet 

1043
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:02,741
that's involved in this symbiotic 
relationship with another life form and 

1044
00:51:02,741 --> 00:51:03,230
that other life form is technology.

1045
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:08,650
I mean if you don't classify life as 
something that has a heartbeat and 

1046
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,161
something that bleeds,
but if you classify life as something 

1047
00:51:12,161 --> 00:51:14,831
that evolves and changes and grows and 
something that is like inexorably linked

1048
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:17,810
to human beings,
technology is just like a virus.

1049
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:23,020
Technology is just like something,
some sort of a bacteria that's in your 

1050
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:23,390
system that you can't get out of.
Well,

1051
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,440
you know,
like you have to have a lot of healthy 

1052
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,401
bacteria in your body all the time and 
that that's like you have a symbiotic 

1053
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:31,970
relationship with this healthy bacteria 
and it keeps you alive.

1054
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:34,940
It actually fights off other bacteria.
I mean,

1055
00:51:34,941 --> 00:51:37,040
that's what probiotics are.
That's what acidophilus says.

1056
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,450
You're taking in a live culture that 
will be your,

1057
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,350
your warriors,
and they will fight off bad bacteria.

1058
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:47,650
Well,
it's very possible that that's what 

1059
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,481
technology is.
The technology is a life force that we 

1060
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,330
are interfaced with and we are.

1061
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,940
We have a symbiotic relationship with 
this other thing.

1062
00:51:52,941 --> 00:51:56,690
And we needed to keep us alive.
We needed to keep the power on,

1063
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,560
you know,
to keep,

1064
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,610
to keep us warm in cold climates to,
you know,

1065
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,690
to make sure your car gets you to work,
you know,

1066
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:07,840
to make sure that the airbag goes off to
save your life and all this shit is 

1067
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,210
designed to help us.
But in turn we keep it going.

1068
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:16,390
We look at old cars on the side of the 
road that have broken down and dead and 

1069
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,140
those things are just like dead bodies,
you know,

1070
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,670
cars that are old that stay alive,
that's just like,

1071
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:22,070
wow,
that's fucking cool.

1072
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,680
That's just like seeing an old man at 
the gym with big muscles like,

1073
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:26,060
Holy Shit,
you know,

1074
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:29,510
I mean literally like technology and 
things that we create,

1075
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:35,050
we are helping those things evolve.
We are helping those things evolve with 

1076
00:52:35,421 --> 00:52:38,660
our materialism,
with our obsession with technology.

1077
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,190
We are trying to always constantly get 
the newer,

1078
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:46,160
better cooler shit and in doing that and
then supply that,

1079
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,250
we are forcing people to work in that 
industry and continue to evolve 

1080
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,890
technology mean it's very possible that 
it's all one fucking big thing.

1081
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,490
So that's my opinion on that.

1082
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,730
What I get for Christmas.
Your mother's pussy.

1083
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:03,980
Oh,

1084
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:08,380
what's my opinion of.
Oh,

1085
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,450
this is too tripper.
Some people just get way too.

1086
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:12,320
DMT On me.

1087
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,670
Stream is the extreme.
Hippies are weird to me.

1088
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:21,120
This dude's question.
This is NPO.

1089
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,890
Sharman.
What is your opinion of the non ordinary

1090
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:26,040
reality access DMT and

1091
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,040
other NCO substances?
In Theo gins are,

1092
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:36,410
um,
I think the literal translation is 

1093
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:37,020
something that connects you to God but a
psychedelic drugs.

1094
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,500
Do you feel there is much to learn from 
this version of reality?

1095
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:42,420
How can it be applied to ordinary 
reality?

1096
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,430
That's the real problem with any 
psychedelic drugs,

1097
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:47,940
whether you're doing Salvia or doing dmt
or smoking weed.

1098
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,730
It's like,
what are you bringing any of that back?

1099
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,890
Is it enhancing your life?
Do you think?

1100
00:53:52,891 --> 00:53:54,990
Anything enhances your law?
I don't know that question.

1101
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:56,060
To me it seems like he,
he,

1102
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,350
he wrote it in the garage with his car 
running.

1103
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,750
What do you think?
What's my take on Charlie Sheen?

1104
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:12,960
Charlie Sheen is a dude who's friends 
with Alex.

1105
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,840
Joe like me,
but he's not laughing.

1106
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:16,770
He,
um,

1107
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,000
he is a nine slash 11 conspiracy buff.
He's an actor.

1108
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,810
He knows every data that you know,
he might have just met.

1109
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:29,480
He's an actor after the tough action 
man.

1110
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,560
I mean,
I know a couple of actors that are 

1111
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:34,560
pretty cool,
but not that many.

1112
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,220
Most of them are really annoying.
Somebody said it busted the actors,

1113
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:39,210
like Comedians,
but when.

1114
00:54:39,211 --> 00:54:42,160
No punchline,
they always want to talk,

1115
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,220
ain't got shit.
They're not giving you anything back.

1116
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,400
At least like with Joey Diaz is talking 
like you're going to be laughing and 

1117
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:49,620
you're going to enjoy it.
You want them to talk,

1118
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:52,620
but after it's just talk,
you know,

1119
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:57,480
actors always have the answers to like 
if you're talking to actors,

1120
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:02,660
very rarely does an actor want to admit 
that they don't know why something is 

1121
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:02,660
this or something.

1122
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:02,930
Is that why,
you know,

1123
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:06,300
they always have opinions,
like really poorly thought out opinions,

1124
00:55:06,301 --> 00:55:09,300
whether it's on politics or a war or 
anything.

1125
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,030
Have you recently,
uh,

1126
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,840
an followed somebody on twitter because 
they just tweeted too much?

1127
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,240
I just unfollowed them.
No,

1128
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:23,700
I hardly ever unfollow someone you all 
the time I bought a block.

1129
00:55:23,701 --> 00:55:27,540
People if they just have arguments with 
me and just sort of boring,

1130
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,870
but I followed the dumbest 
motherfuckers.

1131
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:35,871
I followed so many dumb people.
I didn't want to tell you what they're 

1132
00:55:35,871 --> 00:55:38,691
doing.
I don't want to tell you who they are 

1133
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,240
because some of them,
some of them were just fantastic.

1134
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,370
Fantastic.
With their terrible tweet.

1135
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,350
I just unfollowed Kevin Smith the other 
day because she spent,

1136
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:49,790
he literally spent two hours replying to
every single person that has rode them 

1137
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:52,810
and like the last two months,
and you did it because it blogs up your.

1138
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,330
It was all him and had no one else.
I'm like,

1139
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,650
Oh,
next page.

1140
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,840
Are you serious?
She liked him though.

1141
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,700
I do like them,
but that's bullshit.

1142
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,730
Dude.
Needs to learn how to fucking use 

1143
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:05,730
twitter.
Well,

1144
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:05,730
how you're supposed to do if you don't 
reply direct messages,

1145
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,150
but to all those people,
if you're gonna,

1146
00:56:07,151 --> 00:56:12,151
if you're gonna replace all our time.
We don't care what this answer this 

1147
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:12,151
question is that if you do,
yeah,

1148
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:17,100
the messages,
the problem with the direct messages 

1149
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,100
that you kept,
everybody

1150
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:20,290
else can see it in.
One of the cool things about Kevin Smith

1151
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:25,291
is like before following Kevin and you 
get to see everybody saw Kevin Smith 

1152
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:31,210
responded to you this video type shit.
Then and reply go,

1153
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:36,211
okay,
here's our next person from twitter to 

1154
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:36,370
do because it just ruins everything 
else.

1155
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,910
I hate it.
I met Kevin Smith and he's cool as fuck.

1156
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,330
Fuck that.
I'll never unfollow him.

1157
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:46,840
He could put pages of Shit on my twitter
and I will.

1158
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,810
I will keep it going to.
I love.

1159
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,420
I love the database.
That's just uncalled for.

1160
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,790
What do I think of Ben Stein Calling 
Ron?

1161
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:55,810
Paul?
Antisemitic.

1162
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,340
I don't think about it at all.
It's hilarious.

1163
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:00,950
There's two old queens.
I would love to see Ben Stein.

1164
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,480
Ron Paul suck at each of those costs.
I would pay a thousand dollars for that.

1165
00:57:04,481 --> 00:57:06,010
But you seemed brutal yet.
No,

1166
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:07,540
I have that on video too.

1167
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,870
It's something that watched it and it's.
It's,

1168
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,000
it's that whole part with Ron Pawn and 
ever since I've seen it,

1169
00:57:13,001 --> 00:57:15,220
I always look at him and he looks like 
an old queen to me now.

1170
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:16,720
Ever since then.
Yeah.

1171
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,840
Just how he handled that.
He hit it like,

1172
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,130
I don't know.
Well,

1173
00:57:21,131 --> 00:57:24,310
he super religious so it's possible 
possibly getting right.

1174
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,740
If you're really intelligent and yet 
super religious.

1175
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:28,150
I always gotta go,
all right.

1176
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:30,850
What's going on?
What are you doing belong guys?

1177
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:31,870
We don't.
It's weird.

1178
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,920
Yeah,
there's something wrong.

1179
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,920
Either money or gay.
If you're really intelligent and you're,

1180
00:57:35,921 --> 00:57:40,921
you're really buying into,
and this is not saying you know that 

1181
00:57:40,921 --> 00:57:42,500
there's no god.
It's not saying that there's no this not

1182
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:47,520
something else.
I'm the first one to say that I don't 

1183
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:47,520
know.
I have no idea,

1184
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,030
but I'm also the first one to say that 
you don't know either and anybody that 

1185
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,391
pays any attention to religion or 
follows religion at all and it looks at 

1186
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:54,400
the history of religion,
knows that it's a.

1187
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:59,850
it's a disjointed mess and nobody even 
knows the origins of all this stuff and 

1188
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:03,901
nobody knows how much people altered the
words and what we do know about it is 

1189
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:04,720
that the.
Even the Bible itself,

1190
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:09,721
the oldest version of the Bible,
they don't even used the Dead Sea 

1191
00:58:09,721 --> 00:58:12,900
Scrolls.
That's the oldest version of the Bible 

1192
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:12,900
by far.
They don't even.

1193
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:13,930
They don't even use that when you think 
that's like the best one,

1194
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,390
wouldn't it as like the purest version 
of it?

1195
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,760
Now we're still busy using the new 
testament.

1196
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,450
The New Testament was created by 
Constantine and a bunch of bishops.

1197
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,580
They piled it together and the Old 
Testament.

1198
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,540
Well,
the Old Testament,

1199
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:30,541
the real,
real version of it was written in 

1200
00:58:30,541 --> 00:58:32,551
ancient Hebrew and to this day in 2009,
they only know three out of four words 

1201
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:33,520
in ancient Hebrew,
that's 20,

1202
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,210
25 percent of the words,
they don't know what the fuck it means.

1203
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,220
And on top of that letters also double 
those numbers back then because there,

1204
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,410
there was no numbers.
So the letter a was also like the number

1205
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,150
one,
like if you did it that way.

1206
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:51,330
So there was a numerical value to words 
that was completely lost when they 

1207
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:52,750
translated,
translated,

1208
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:57,751
uh,
ancient Hebrew to Latin and then to 

1209
00:58:57,751 --> 00:58:57,751
Greek.
So like,

1210
00:58:57,751 --> 00:58:59,800
like the word love and the word God,
they have the same numerical value.

1211
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,680
So we don't even really knowing what the
fuck they were saying.

1212
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:05,740
So No,
I'm not saying that there is no god,

1213
00:59:05,741 --> 00:59:10,741
that there's not something else.
But what I'm saying is the follow 

1214
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:11,890
current religion as it's practiced and 
preached today,

1215
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:13,930
it's ridiculous.
It's ridiculous.

1216
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,120
So if Ron Paul's really into that,

1217
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,150
come on,
big old queen.

1218
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,840
What is doing?
Let's Ron Paul,

1219
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,940
big old queen.
Like if he just came out and said he's a

1220
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,420
big old queen,
I would still vote for him,

1221
00:59:27,421 --> 00:59:28,880
man.
I think he's a bad motherfucker.

1222
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:34,060
I would like to see if somebody's really
tried to get in there and shake up the 

1223
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:35,690
system and change the way you know,
the,

1224
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,590
the,
the world is run and you know,

1225
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:42,640
keep us out of other countries and to 
demolish the irs and get rid of the CIA.

1226
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:48,161
And that'd be fascinating.
Fascinating to see if someone can 

1227
00:59:48,161 --> 00:59:49,070
actually do that and not get killed.
I don't think that

1228
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:52,200
good if it Kendall.
Yeah.

1229
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:55,200
I got Kendall,
what?

1230
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,300
Just wondering.
I just got one of those Sony readers for

1231
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:00,240
Christmas,
um,

1232
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:05,600
when it's cool because Google bought all
these books and so I don't know if you 

1233
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,690
can do this with a candle or not,
but with this one way you can just go to

1234
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,190
google and download all these free books
on it.

1235
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,800
And they have your itch issue of Kung Fu
magazine or whatever.

1236
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,410
Karate magazine.
Black though.

1237
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,520
Oh,
that I was in.

1238
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,370
Yeah.
They have that.

1239
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,730
And so that's the Sony reader.
You can go and get that.

1240
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:23,380
So you can get any book basically for 
free.

1241
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,660
Well not any book,
but any other ones.

1242
01:00:25,661 --> 01:00:30,661
I'm Google has like a ton of books,
but they're all like old school at a 

1243
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:30,661
print books.
I think it has to be out,

1244
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:35,300
man.
I got the kindle and I couldn't get any 

1245
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,021
hunter s thompson books.
One book that he wrote that was for 

1246
01:00:37,021 --> 01:00:37,280
sale,
but they didn't have a great shark.

1247
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:42,380
It didn't have to google.com
backslash books and see if they have it 

1248
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,141
there and he was downloaded.
I don't know if it works on kindle 

1249
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:46,141
though.
Probably a kindle reader.

1250
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:46,420
PDF files.
It does,

1251
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,450
but when it reads pdf files doesn't let 
you enlarge the text,

1252
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:50,620
which was annoying.
Oh,

1253
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:51,460
you can do that on the sign.

1254
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:53,910
Fucking shit.
I got the wrong one.

1255
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,550
No,
I don't still better probably.

1256
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,100
And our question earlier when we were 
talking,

1257
01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:03,140
what about kitting poker?
Can these bots on poker sites?

1258
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,160
Poker?
Jay who was a John Carlos Alvarado was 

1259
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:14,841
on the rubbing board,
says poker sites catch bots with the 

1260
01:01:14,841 --> 01:01:17,280
program that can see if you click the 
same pixel every time you make a move.

1261
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,010
Something that's impossible to do by a 
human.

1262
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:20,950
Oh,

1263
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:24,850
I guess why you have the program go over
a couple of pixels.

1264
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:25,790
Yeah,
I agree.

1265
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:27,860
Time change the program,
right?

1266
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:31,060
Figured it out already to thing sucks.
How has the shit.

1267
01:01:31,061 --> 01:01:32,200
I just thought it was excellent.

1268
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,770
Did I really forget everything I learned
during the taekwondo days?

1269
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,590
I still remember some type of window 
stuff.

1270
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:47,620
Some stuff talking window is effective.
Like you see commonly leaves and a lot 

1271
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:50,960
of taekwondo.
He used a lot of turn side kicks in 

1272
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:51,860
front lake side kicks and frontline 
roundhouse kicks where it doesn't switch

1273
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,270
the legs.
That's.

1274
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,640
There's a lot of power and that stuff.
It's just,

1275
01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:58,910
it's not complete in taekwondo needs 
other things.

1276
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,340
It needs more time wrestling.
When did you get to and all that stuff,

1277
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:06,580
but it helps.
There's some stuff in it that's 

1278
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:06,580
different.
You know,

1279
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:11,110
the,
the style of a like karate that Machida 

1280
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,790
uses the leaping in and leaping out.
Nobody knew that that would work before.

1281
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,320
No,
because no one was ever good at it.

1282
01:02:15,321 --> 01:02:20,321
That was good at other stuff as well and
I think that's sort of the same thing 

1283
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:20,321
with kindly and window

1284
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,990
Du du Du du Du du Du.

1285
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:34,930
These questions all suck.
Twitter suck cock on my website guys.

1286
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:41,090
A bunch of gay ass motherfuckers.
Stupid ass questions.

1287
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:46,740
Um

1288
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,320
Oh.
Same questions with the same people.

1289
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:56,220
Circumcised.
Here's a good question.

1290
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,980
What'd you get your kids circumcised in 
this day and age?

1291
01:02:58,981 --> 01:03:01,340
Because most guys in America or cut?
No.

1292
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,900
I am not going to.
If I have a boy and his new baby,

1293
01:03:03,901 --> 01:03:07,290
we don't know what it is yet.
We'll find out soon and if it's a boy,

1294
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,990
I'm going to let them have a big 
elephant.

1295
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:14,200
You're discussed and care what?
My baby's Dick looks like.

1296
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:18,710
What the fuck?
He wants a lot of video of it.

1297
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,540
No,
no.

1298
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:22,120
I mean I was thinking of that just the 
other day.

1299
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,160
So funny that this person asked us to.
Dick comes out a certain way of senior 

1300
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,460
time before knows.
And that covers it like a turtle neck.

1301
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:30,710
Do you.
Have you ever seen porn?

1302
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:33,590
Just felt bad for the poor guy.
A fucking creep Dick?

1303
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,870
Yeah.
Bad circumstance.

1304
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,630
Have you talked to girls about this?
I don't give a character like,

1305
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:40,640
oh my God.
He had an unsophisticated stick.

1306
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:45,670
It was so disgusting.
That chance to talk to girls that have 

1307
01:03:45,670 --> 01:03:46,250
sucked uncircumcised dicks and they 
don't care.

1308
01:03:46,550 --> 01:03:47,690
It's a little different.
Yeah.

1309
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,600
Yeah.
Any girl that would care doesn't count.

1310
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,950
It's good.
It keep constantly from my boy.

1311
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,490
I'm picky.
It doesn't like a uncircumcised Dick.

1312
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:00,550
And what's your why?
Why do you just think it's just 

1313
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:03,490
ridiculous.
It's totally unnecessary and it feels 

1314
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:03,490
better.
Supposedly we need.

1315
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:06,530
I don't need help coming faster and 
faster.

1316
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,560
It actually feels better.
It's more sensitive.

1317
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,530
It's not whether you come from you.
Actually it's more enjoyment.

1318
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:13,940
Silly,
man.

1319
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:17,810
I'm not getting.
My kids are ridiculous.

1320
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:22,670
This is ridiculous.
I hate and find so weird.

1321
01:04:22,671 --> 01:04:25,370
I'm so glad.
I'm just like something.

1322
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:28,040
I think every day I'm like,
thank you dad for.

1323
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:33,160
Oh my God.
I know there's websites out there were 

1324
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,160
dudes.
Try to regrow their skin.

1325
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:36,160
It's a long process to research them.
Size or Dick,

1326
01:04:36,170 --> 01:04:38,560
they stretch it out.
They have like little things.

1327
01:04:38,561 --> 01:04:41,500
I get attachment that you clip onto the 
tip of your daycare.

1328
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,640
It gets more.
They get more infections in,

1329
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:48,720
in,
in like dirt inside there and it's like 

1330
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,690
if you have a deck,
that's my answer to that.

1331
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:52,190
Clean your fucking Dick.
Look.

1332
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,580
How hard is it to wash your Dick?
I hate dirty dip.

1333
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:57,010
People should not have.
I have

1334
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:01,820
no circumcised nerc circumcisions,
but if you're a cleanli personally,

1335
01:05:01,870 --> 01:05:06,870
you shouldn't be like my boy bullbait.
He will have an uncircumcised Dick got 

1336
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:06,990
down.
Have you ever.

1337
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,280
We think we already talked about that.
What have you ever ate out a girl that 

1338
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:12,280
had really long,
prissy works?

1339
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:12,750
Yeah,
I like that.

1340
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:15,870
There's one way I could stretch probably
that far.

1341
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:17,590
It was just,
it was like chewing gum

1342
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,720
when you always in your mouth.
Do,

1343
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,090
do,
do,

1344
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:21,720
do,
do,

1345
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:22,980
do,
do.

1346
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:29,260
See,
this is to.

1347
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:32,930
All these questions are like old.
It's like a hour ago on now.

1348
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,990
Hayden.
Funny his twitter,

1349
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:38,360
his twitter is the bomb diggity.
What is it?

1350
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:40,780
The mark,
Hayden that I think he changed it to the

1351
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:43,210
dumb mark gating.
I'm starting to think it's not real.

1352
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:45,670
What do you mean?
Who chose the name of it?

1353
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:47,280
I don't know.
No,

1354
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:50,470
there's someone changed the name of it.
Whoever's doing it.

1355
01:05:50,471 --> 01:05:51,720
Then why would they do that?
Man,

1356
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,760
we got a thing going on.
Motherfuckers been good on.

1357
01:05:57,700 --> 01:06:02,700
Do you think are lifetime microchips has
something to do with dogs where it scan 

1358
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:02,700
and send access?
Yeah,

1359
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,660
I think that's going to happen.
Yeah.

1360
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:09,661
I think.
I think it's very possible that there's 

1361
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:09,820
going to be some sort of a microchip 
thing where human beings are going to be

1362
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:13,180
scanned into a database.
The real problem is there's just so many

1363
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:14,320
fucking people.

1364
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,890
There's so many goddamn people.
How you do that?

1365
01:06:16,930 --> 01:06:19,090
How do you keep track of it?
Who's going to watch it like people used

1366
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:19,720
to say,
Oh man,

1367
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:24,721
what if your phones are bugged?
Who's who's bugging these phones in 

1368
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:24,721
workers,
government workers.

1369
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,540
How many people they watch him are 
there.

1370
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:32,541
Is there one person for every person out
there they just circling on you because 

1371
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:32,541
they know you sell pot,
like,

1372
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:37,490
come on man.
How many fucking people are out there 

1373
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,260
that that could actually be monitoring 
people's phones?

1374
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:42,160
Well now they have the technology where 
they can just sit there and record every

1375
01:06:42,161 --> 01:06:45,580
single phone call and it transcribes it 
like dragon speak,

1376
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:50,581
but times 50 technology and it pretty 
much looks for keywords like money drug,

1377
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:51,730
you know?

1378
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:54,990
Yeah,
that's.

1379
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:56,920
That makes sense.
I've heard that before.

1380
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,890
There's things like video programs,
like what's it called,

1381
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:01,750
Predator or something like that.
They had one,

1382
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:07,160
there was a.
We go through the Internet and search 

1383
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:07,600
for like al Qaeda for search for 
terrorists,

1384
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:09,580
search for certain specific key words,

1385
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:16,070
peak oil versus science.
You know what man,

1386
01:07:16,071 --> 01:07:18,890
I think they're going to figure out some
other shit besides oil.

1387
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:21,350
I think it makes sense.
I think you know,

1388
01:07:21,650 --> 01:07:23,840
there's a lot of stuff they could do 
with agriculture.

1389
01:07:23,841 --> 01:07:25,580
There's a lot of stuff they can do with 
hydrogen.

1390
01:07:25,581 --> 01:07:30,581
There's a lot of stuff.
It's just we could have come up with 

1391
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:33,941
something else.
It's just we got bamboozled into going 

1392
01:07:33,941 --> 01:07:35,600
the way the oil because it was easy and 
cheap and it was already in place and we

1393
01:07:35,601 --> 01:07:37,310
stayed with oil,
but I don't.

1394
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:40,250
I don't think society is going to 
crumble because we run out of oil.

1395
01:07:40,251 --> 01:07:42,110
I think we'll come up with something 
just as good.

1396
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:45,790
She heard those meal,
a mini coopers in the cold.

1397
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:50,320
They electric ones in cold weather and 
only gets half the power.

1398
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:56,700
How big is that?
That's ridiculous because they're only 

1399
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,451
good for like 100 miles as it is.
So in cold weather it goes 50 slash 50 

1400
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:00,451
miles,
if that makes sense.

1401
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,660
Because your batteries more dead in cold
weather piece.

1402
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:05,340
Shit.
Yeah,

1403
01:08:05,350 --> 01:08:08,450
but the amount of buying that car,
that's an expensive car imagined.

1404
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,720
You know what we top gear.
Did you know that show?

1405
01:08:10,721 --> 01:08:12,070
Top gear.
BBC.

1406
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:17,071
Awesome show.
They took one of those Prius's and 

1407
01:08:17,071 --> 01:08:20,151
electric car and they drove it around a 
track with a presence.

1408
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:20,970
A hybrid,
right.

1409
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:26,340
They drove it around the track with an m
three and all the [inaudible] had to do 

1410
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,930
was keep up with the Prius.
That's all it had to do.

1411
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:33,110
The preschool and went full blast or on 
the track and the [inaudible] obviously 

1412
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,110
much,
much faster car.

1413
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,570
All I gotta do is keep up.
The Prius got 13 miles to the gallon and

1414
01:08:36,571 --> 01:08:41,060
the [inaudible] got 19,
so when the Prius drives hard,

1415
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:43,720
it's just as much of a piece of shit as 
you know,

1416
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:44,810
any other car.
It's like,

1417
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:49,820
it's nonsense.
It's like it's fake being green and it 

1418
01:08:49,820 --> 01:08:53,590
apparently it's much more toxic to the 
environment to create a Prius as to how 

1419
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:57,040
it worked is Prius is uh,
only uh,

1420
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:02,220
our electric under 25 miles an hour or 
something like that for stop and go 

1421
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:02,220
traffic.
It's,

1422
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:04,460
it's,
it's running off battery over that.

1423
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,330
Just a normal car.

1424
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:06,830
That makes sense.
Yeah.

1425
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:09,600
And over that as a normal car,
it's terrible.

1426
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,310
It's just a small,
shitty,

1427
01:09:11,311 --> 01:09:13,050
terrible God damn piece of shit.

1428
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,290
Right.

1429
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:25,680
That was bb Jones with the circumcision 
question.

1430
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,080
It's so weird he asked that because I 
was just thinking that.

1431
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,510
The good question,
man,

1432
01:09:30,511 --> 01:09:33,270
that's a good question.
That's a weird thing with people.

1433
01:09:33,271 --> 01:09:35,410
I didn't really worry about what your 
kids did.

1434
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,320
Did it start?
Well?

1435
01:09:37,321 --> 01:09:40,440
I just think everyday how,
how thankful I am.

1436
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:44,310
You're so silly.
If I had your little Dick,

1437
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:48,990
I would cry myself to sleep or somebody 
close to this on the board

1438
01:09:49,280 --> 01:09:53,020
today about being Indian men and that,
uh,

1439
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,860
there's like some,
what is it?

1440
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,440
Sixty percent of Indian men?
Um,

1441
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,300
I don't know if this is a true 
statistic.

1442
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,940
Somebody I've been rocked,
posted it.

1443
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:06,941
So tell you what a grant assault.
Sixty percent of Indian men cannot use a

1444
01:10:07,091 --> 01:10:12,091
standard condom.
One in five condoms fall off during 

1445
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:13,720
intercourse.
So this is from the BBC.

1446
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,600
Is it true?
I don't know.

1447
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,830
We're going to go to it.
Damn the BBC.

1448
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:18,920
Yeah.
If you go to India,

1449
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:23,600
data fucks and women.
Wow.

1450
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:24,170
It really is.

1451
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,300
Wow.
It's true.

1452
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:30,430
Have more than a thousand men in India 
has concluded that condoms are made 

1453
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:34,030
according to international sizes are too
large for the majority of Indian men.

1454
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,370
That's crazy.
That's sad.

1455
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:40,620
As a magnum user,
I feel for you bitch.

1456
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:47,430
Wow.
Scientists even check their sample check

1457
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:52,431
to see if their sample was 
representative of India as a whole in 

1458
01:10:52,431 --> 01:10:53,760
terms of class religion in urban and 
rural dwellers.

1459
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:56,430
So even like the peasants,
you know,

1460
01:10:56,431 --> 01:10:59,370
even the slaves in India have a little 
dicks,

1461
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:03,030
so sad.
Least the peasants of the like the lower

1462
01:11:03,031 --> 01:11:05,910
class America are generally thought to 
have the biggest dicks.

1463
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,740
Right?
Slaves.

1464
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:13,100
Back in the day when they had slaves,
those guys almost had monster horse 

1465
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:13,100
decks.
Yeah.

1466
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,220
How many white women do think flux 
letters back then?

1467
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,800
Ten tons of.
Do you think they did when their 

1468
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,401
husbands stop fucking right,
snuck in and just got some Alabama black

1469
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:22,800
snake.

1470
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:27,600
How many white women do you think had 
babies with slips back then?

1471
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:29,550
I think that had.
There was a lot of dead babies.

1472
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:30,840
Really?
Yeah.

1473
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:34,440
There was a lot of white guys who would 
fuck the black slaves.

1474
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:38,400
That was very common and have babies 
with their black slaves up.

1475
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:39,900
Fuck.
That must have been.

1476
01:11:39,901 --> 01:11:44,901
How weird must that have been to the.
The guy who was the father would fuck 

1477
01:11:45,361 --> 01:11:47,040
the slave,
have a baby with a slave.

1478
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:52,041
The slave would have his baby and he 
would see this half white baby and he 

1479
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:55,971
would just leave the half white baby 
with the slaves and let them take care 

1480
01:11:55,971 --> 01:11:55,971
of it like you wouldn't even bring it 
into.

1481
01:11:55,971 --> 01:11:59,160
Has this kid just because of a race 
thing that must be.

1482
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:04,430
That must have been fucking enough.
Talk about like haunting your 

1483
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:06,540
conscience.
How Weird is witch trials?

1484
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:08,340
You know,
the old school widths trouser where they

1485
01:12:08,341 --> 01:12:13,260
would like way witches or it still goes 
on today in Africa and Africa,

1486
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:16,920
they still have a huge problem with 
people accusing people of being switched

1487
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:22,150
video where they caught him on fire and 
they're just sitting there on five 

1488
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:22,150
beating with sticks and kick it.

1489
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,340
This is real recent.
There was a,

1490
01:12:23,341 --> 01:12:24,000
um,
here,

1491
01:12:24,001 --> 01:12:26,940
I'll put it on twitter.
I wrote a blog article about it and it's

1492
01:12:26,941 --> 01:12:30,300
one of the worst videos that in Hong 
Kong girl snorting yourself to death.

1493
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:35,330
Yeah.
There's the video that you could see 

1494
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:36,891
this Hong Kong girl,
she snorts this gigantic line of 

1495
01:12:36,891 --> 01:12:40,131
Ketamine.
Ketamine is a fucking cat tranquilizer 

1496
01:12:40,131 --> 01:12:44,100
and a lot of crazy kids are doing this 
and she snorted this gigantic line for a

1497
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:47,850
video and then one of dying the videos 
available online along with the store,

1498
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:52,370
trying to find the.

1499
01:12:53,610 --> 01:12:56,460
Well,
I'll put that article online that I,

1500
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:58,710
um,
that I wrote about.

1501
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:01,450
I think it was called

1502
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:04,350
humanity gone haywire.
I think that was the,

1503
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:09,351
uh,
that was the name of the article,

1504
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:15,750
but it was all about how,
how funny it is that there's this real 

1505
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:15,910
problem they have right now.

1506
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,750
I don't know when that was from.
There's no search option.

1507
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,700
My blog archives are k through that.
There's no search option.

1508
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,440
It's weird.
I have a search shopping.

1509
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:33,740
This is terrible.
Let's for tell you dude,

1510
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,210
look at that.
My fucking website is.

1511
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,610
This is way better.
Yeah,

1512
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:50,110
Google is way better for searching then

1513
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:53,820
my own website,
[inaudible] website.

1514
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,090
My website is being redesigned right 
now.

1515
01:13:57,091 --> 01:14:02,091
People.
You've been saying it for eight years.

1516
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:05,460
It has been designed for eight years,
so I'm sure.

1517
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:11,140
Dammit,
let me find out the twitter.

1518
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:12,100
This bitch

1519
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,330
guys.

1520
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:21,520
Ah,
ah,

1521
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:22,780
ah,
ah.

1522
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:30,300
Here's the battery.

1523
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,520
All right.
I put it,

1524
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:47,390
I've just pushed,
put it up on twitter if you bored and 

1525
01:14:47,390 --> 01:14:49,170
you want to read this thing about 
witchcraft,

1526
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,840
watch the video.
It's really creepy.

1527
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:57,260
You know,
a funny thing about witchcraft in 

1528
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:59,271
America,
like everybody knows about the Salem 

1529
01:14:59,271 --> 01:14:59,271
witch trials.
Well,

1530
01:14:59,271 --> 01:14:59,271
what I read,
um,

1531
01:14:59,271 --> 01:15:02,370
the biggest connection they have to what
happened during them,

1532
01:15:02,371 --> 01:15:07,371
why everybody thought they were being 
possessed and there's witchcraft going 

1533
01:15:07,371 --> 01:15:10,131
on was that there was a late frost and 
that the wheat got frozen and when it 

1534
01:15:11,551 --> 01:15:14,250
sought out,
apparently when that happens,

1535
01:15:14,251 --> 01:15:17,490
when there's a late frost and freezes 
and thaws out,

1536
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:22,910
it grows a certain fungus on it.
And this certain fungus is called Ercot 

1537
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:29,360
in Ercot has,
it's like really similar or identical 

1538
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:33,681
rather chemically to lsd.
So when they would take this bread that 

1539
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:36,750
they would make from this wheat that had
grown this fungus on it,

1540
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:39,090
these people would fucking trip their 
balls off.

1541
01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:42,450
They would have these crazy,
horrifying bad acid trip.

1542
01:15:42,451 --> 01:15:44,940
So they literally fund.
They were under a spell,

1543
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:48,930
which totally makes sense and they just 
started burning bitches.

1544
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:52,230
And women always want to say that it's 
you.

1545
01:15:52,231 --> 01:15:52,860
Oh,
you know,

1546
01:15:52,861 --> 01:15:54,360
men were,
you know,

1547
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,660
back then,
you know,

1548
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:56,610
men were,
uh,

1549
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,640
the,
the spell that a woman would cast upon 

1550
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,921
her upon him with her beauty was just to
perplexing and the men couldn't deal 

1551
01:16:03,921 --> 01:16:05,880
with the fact that women had all those 
powers that killed him.

1552
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:07,440
Eh,
come on,

1553
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:10,380
guys have been raping chicks forever.
He tell him,

1554
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:12,210
got to stop back.
Then there's,

1555
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,030
this is not that much.
This not that perplexing.

1556
01:16:15,031 --> 01:16:16,890
It's guys want to shoot a,
they shoot a load,

1557
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,650
you know,
a guy's wants you to load the jerk off.

1558
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,510
They don't want to shoot a load anymore,
you know,

1559
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,300
they're not going to start burying 
people because they want to fuck them.

1560
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,500
I don't believe that.
I think it's a much more likely scenario

1561
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:33,501
that this fungus grew on this wheat 
because they had already taken soil 

1562
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:36,330
samples.
And so they had known from there,

1563
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:41,360
you know,
whatever climatological studies that 

1564
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:41,930
they use to figure out how cold it was 
during a specific time.

1565
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,100
There was a late frost,
there was some evidence that there was a

1566
01:16:44,101 --> 01:16:46,420
late frost and then this,
um,

1567
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:50,670
or God was also found somehow or another
during this time period.

1568
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,880
So I think it's just speculation,
but it's much more educated speculation 

1569
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,800
and the idea that the men were under the
spell of these women and they decided to

1570
01:16:58,801 --> 01:17:00,810
kill him.
That doesn't make any sense.

1571
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:05,390
I think they probably did the acid from 
the wheat and then killed the cons.

1572
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,080
That's probably what it was,
you know,

1573
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:12,110
that's why I was a witch trial.
Those were probably the context in the 

1574
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:12,110
town.

1575
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:12,170
If I would just,
let's cut these major bitches.

1576
01:17:12,171 --> 01:17:14,270
Yeah.
Like these chicks are bad energy.

1577
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:15,530
Like you'd be around.
I'm like,

1578
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:18,040
fucking pitches given me bad vibes,
you know,

1579
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:23,050
because you're all acid now and they 
probably just started lighting them on 

1580
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:23,050
fire.
I'm like,

1581
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:23,050
fuck it,
let's kill this bitch.

1582
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:25,210
Why are we having are around.
Imagine if that's really.

1583
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,800
The witch trials were out.
Maybe like afterwards,

1584
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:30,230
people were so nice.
They killed all the cuts off.

1585
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:31,710
Imagine that.

1586
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:36,990
Is that possible ladies and gentlemen?
Does that make sense?

1587
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,400
Little Fuck is calling me during my God 
damn podcast,

1588
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,280
Tait Fletcher.
No,

1589
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,860
my fucking ustream.
Bitch.

1590
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,380
How dare you.

1591
01:17:46,410 --> 01:17:48,120
All right,
let's go back to the question.

1592
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:48,750
So a gentleman.

1593
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,440
Have I ever seen the northern lights in 
Iceland?

1594
01:17:52,441 --> 01:17:53,940
No,
I've never seen him in purpose.

1595
01:17:53,941 --> 01:17:54,630
So.
Awesome.

1596
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:57,030
I've seen some shit online though.
It looks incredible.

1597
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:00,060
It's like the sky becomes like a desktop
screensaver.

1598
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:03,540
I've been seeing way more falling stars 
lately.

1599
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:06,540
Like it's almost getting to the point 
where it's kind of ridiculous.

1600
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:09,390
Yeah,
it's maybe a deer coming once a week.

1601
01:18:09,391 --> 01:18:11,070
Maybe.
I see it at least one.

1602
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:14,010
Could you imagine if we know for me it 
does.

1603
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:19,040
It doesn't seem like it's real,
like you said and talk about like 

1604
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,250
asteroid impacts over the asteroid that 
killed the dinosaurs 65 million years 

1605
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:23,970
ago or the one that killed you know 
everything before that.

1606
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:26,640
The mass extinction before that 250 
million years ago,

1607
01:18:26,641 --> 01:18:31,641
or the one that ended the Ice Age 10,500
years ago when there's all this 

1608
01:18:31,641 --> 01:18:35,511
speculation about asteroids,
but the real reality is there are 

1609
01:18:35,511 --> 01:18:40,380
gigantic,
hundreds of thousands of gigantic rocks 

1610
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:43,700
in space that can fuck us up and every 
now and then one comes crashing down.

1611
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:46,860
It's happened many,
many,

1612
01:18:46,861 --> 01:18:47,700
many,
many,

1613
01:18:47,701 --> 01:18:51,270
many times over the history of the life 
of the earth.

1614
01:18:51,271 --> 01:18:55,140
It's happened so many times and it could
easily happen today.

1615
01:18:55,410 --> 01:19:00,410
It could easily happen tomorrow.
You can easily one that comes from 

1616
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:02,390
behind the sun and we can't see it until
it's too late and there,

1617
01:19:02,391 --> 01:19:07,391
you know,
and just fucks the whole world up.

1618
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:12,560
That's so possible.
We don't like to think it's possible 

1619
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,970
because it's never happened,
but I always like to see.

1620
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:17,610
I always say it's like an ant hill,
that human life is like an ant hill.

1621
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,160
Like if you,
um,

1622
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,000
are an aunt and you're living in an ant 
hill,

1623
01:19:21,001 --> 01:19:24,620
you were probably born in that ant hill 
and that hill is all you've ever known.

1624
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,490
How long to answer live?
Like a week,

1625
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:28,050
couple of weeks,
something like that,

1626
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:30,510
so say like the sand hill has been 
around for six months.

1627
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,240
That's been through the generations 
after generations,

1628
01:19:33,241 --> 01:19:38,241
long dead have made this ant hill and 
then you know your toilet away and your 

1629
01:19:38,241 --> 01:19:43,191
little ant hill and one day some kid is 
walking through the field and he sees 

1630
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:43,191
that anthill.
It just boom,

1631
01:19:43,191 --> 01:19:45,240
boom.
She starts to stomp on it for no fucking

1632
01:19:45,241 --> 01:19:47,430
reason,
and then you're ant hills crushed out of

1633
01:19:47,431 --> 01:19:52,431
nowhere.
You never thought it was going to 

1634
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:52,431
happen.
It's always been fine.

1635
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:52,431
Everything's always been cool.
At the end hill,

1636
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:55,260
if you had a take a gas and you had to 
make a gamble,

1637
01:19:55,261 --> 01:19:55,940
you would say,
yeah,

1638
01:19:55,941 --> 01:20:00,941
yeah,
this and that was always going to be 

1639
01:20:00,941 --> 01:20:00,941
here.
It's always been here.

1640
01:20:00,941 --> 01:20:00,941
Always will be here.
Bam.

1641
01:20:00,941 --> 01:20:01,290
Some kid just stomped the fuck out of 
it.

1642
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,140
That can happen to people that can 
happen to Earth.

1643
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,700
Katrina,
Katrina,

1644
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,690
how about Detroit?

1645
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:13,320
Really?
Somebody who has a magnifying glass on 

1646
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:13,320
it.
Detroit,

1647
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,260
I watched Anthony Bordain had a show 
about Michigan the other night and he 

1648
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:17,600
was there.
They were driving through horrible,

1649
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,730
horrible,
terrible.

1650
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,050
You ever wants that Anthony Bourdain 
show?

1651
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:23,640
Good show.
It makes you hungry.

1652
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,540
He goes to the food show.
No reservations.

1653
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,700
Fucking shows.
It makes me so hungry.

1654
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:37,270
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo says there's an 
asteroid with the possibility of hitting

1655
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:38,730
earth in 20,
29.

1656
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:39,870
Yeah,
there's.

1657
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,380
There's a bunch of them out there that 
they don't know about.

1658
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,750
They come to the problem as the skies 
too.

1659
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,600
God Damn big.
I mean it's covering everywhere.

1660
01:20:48,601 --> 01:20:53,601
Shit's coming from the North Pole and 
the South Pole and you never know where 

1661
01:20:53,601 --> 01:20:57,321
something's coming from.
I mean it could be coming from anywhere 

1662
01:20:57,321 --> 01:20:57,321
in.
You never know.

1663
01:20:57,321 --> 01:21:02,120
There could be something heading our way
that we haven't picked up on could be 

1664
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:02,490
behind something.
We don't see it.

1665
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,100
Gravity distorts our view of things as 
well.

1666
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:08,150
Like if you look at the sun,
you can literally look at it.

1667
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:13,160
Some of the telescope you could see 
things behind the sun because of the 

1668
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,610
distortion and the gravity of the sun 
because it's so massive.

1669
01:21:14,611 --> 01:21:17,380
I don't understand how that works,
but that apparently is how,

1670
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:22,430
how it works,
and so there's occasionally things that 

1671
01:21:22,430 --> 01:21:22,920
could be hiding behind something that's 
coming straight at us.

1672
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:24,720
We don't even fucking see it until it's 
too late,

1673
01:21:25,330 --> 01:21:27,600
you know,
there's just not enough human beings out

1674
01:21:27,601 --> 01:21:30,510
there monitoring the sky to really 
accurately predict,

1675
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:31,320
you know,
oh,

1676
01:21:31,321 --> 01:21:34,410
we're,
we are 100 percent clear skies.

1677
01:21:34,411 --> 01:21:36,330
Nothing's gonna hit us for the next 200 
years.

1678
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:38,790
They don't know that.
They can't say that.

1679
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,710
There's always something that comes real
close.

1680
01:21:40,711 --> 01:21:42,390
They just barely misses us.
And they go,

1681
01:21:42,391 --> 01:21:43,440
Whoa,
Holy Shit.

1682
01:21:43,450 --> 01:21:46,680
I was three miles long and it missed us 
by 200,000

1683
01:21:46,681 --> 01:21:47,640
miles.
That's not much,

1684
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:47,970
you know.

1685
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,670
Okay.
Let's go to some questions.

1686
01:21:57,671 --> 01:21:58,600
You dirty bitches,

1687
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:03,890
Nabisco in 2012.
So as the antichrist.

1688
01:22:04,410 --> 01:22:09,410
Oh No.
So some people think you're set of 2012 

1689
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:09,410
movie.
Yes.

1690
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:10,820
Horrendously bad.
Really bad.

1691
01:22:10,821 --> 01:22:12,890
Not even worth even a special effects 
sucked.

1692
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,240
Oh really?
They were there.

1693
01:22:14,241 --> 01:22:15,080
I mean,
it was awesome.

1694
01:22:15,081 --> 01:22:16,880
Things were happening,
but it didn't look real.

1695
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:22,030
Like the car is,
was a limo and jumping things and 

1696
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:23,620
landing fine.
Driving off and it looked a little talk,

1697
01:22:23,621 --> 01:22:28,250
computer generated and silly.
It's like every five seconds,

1698
01:22:28,251 --> 01:22:29,260
the fucking,
you know,

1699
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:32,510
the car was almost going off the cliff 
but barely made it.

1700
01:22:32,511 --> 01:22:33,080
You know,
it's like,

1701
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,520
come on,
stop.

1702
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:39,760
Stop with your nonsense.
This guy here,

1703
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:50,980
easy dog down below seven says,
yeah,

1704
01:22:50,981 --> 01:22:53,830
I believe in God.
How did everything originate?

1705
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,940
But how did God start?
Oh,

1706
01:22:57,941 --> 01:23:02,941
that's an easy question to answer it.
God.

1707
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:05,240
Um,

1708
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:10,910
were you there?
The real problem is believing in 

1709
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:11,550
anything.
You know,

1710
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:12,940
that's,
that's the real problem.

1711
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,380
The real problem is believing in 
anything.

1712
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:16,430
It's not believing in God.
I believe in God.

1713
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,850
The real problems,
believing in anything you don't know.

1714
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,600
We don't know.
God created a really good video game and

1715
01:23:22,601 --> 01:23:27,601
we're all in it.
That's possible that this is God's 

1716
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:28,930
version of the sims and this is on 
somebodies phone.

1717
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:32,440
Wait,
we're not even like a good video game.

1718
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:37,441
We're just like a fucking cell phone 
video shoot that people play when they 

1719
01:23:37,441 --> 01:23:41,221
kill time,
waiting in line at the right rear break 

1720
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:41,221
break earlier.
It's God.

1721
01:23:41,710 --> 01:23:46,710
The real problem with believing in God 
is that believing in God just makes 

1722
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:46,710
people feel better.
You know,

1723
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:49,030
it's not saying that God doesn't exist.
It's very possible that God exists,

1724
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:53,590
but you you don't have the information 
no one does.

1725
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:56,950
You can decide that you have that 
information because it empowers you.

1726
01:23:57,220 --> 01:24:02,220
You can decide that there's a god 
because it makes you feel more 

1727
01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:05,491
comfortable or makes you feel more.
You know that there's a future to this 

1728
01:24:05,491 --> 01:24:09,931
world and after you die,
there's something waiting for you and 

1729
01:24:09,931 --> 01:24:10,450
that gives you confidence and that gives
you that it can empower you,

1730
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:15,660
and that works for a lot of people.
I know a lot of fighters who are very 

1731
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:18,130
religious and that that belief in God 
that actually empowers them and it can.

1732
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:20,920
It can work that way,
but it really is just a tool.

1733
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:25,980
It's just a psychological tool that 
they're using to empower them and it 

1734
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:29,780
doesn't necessarily help them.
What helps them is the state of mind 

1735
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:31,390
that they put themselves in by believing
in God.

1736
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:34,120
You know,
it's a really kind of a funny thing.

1737
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:37,090
It's a catch 22.
Believing in God can empower you.

1738
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,120
The ideas of Christianity are very 
empowering ideas,

1739
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:42,400
the ideas that you know,
that you know,

1740
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:44,800
love your man as if he sees you and you 
know,

1741
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:48,110
do unto others as if you would have them
do unto yourself and you know,

1742
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:50,920
turn the other cheek and don't be 
violent and be helping.

1743
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:55,450
Be Loving and be humble and worship God 
and the idea of God.

1744
01:24:55,451 --> 01:25:00,451
What God is.
God is life and energy and the whole 

1745
01:25:00,451 --> 01:25:04,111
universe and that you treat the whole 
process as it's one gigantic fantastic 

1746
01:25:04,241 --> 01:25:06,400
thing and that in,
in,

1747
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,660
in going to a religious service and in,
in practicing,

1748
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:12,870
you know any sort of a religion in,
in,

1749
01:25:12,871 --> 01:25:17,871
in like sticking to a certain ethic that
what you're doing is committing to 

1750
01:25:17,871 --> 01:25:21,631
positive energy and if you commit to 
that positive energy and then those 

1751
01:25:21,631 --> 01:25:23,410
positive thoughts and positive way of 
thinking,

1752
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:26,170
that's empowering and that really will 
help you.

1753
01:25:26,350 --> 01:25:31,350
And if you really do believe that you 
have a destiny and that God has carved 

1754
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:33,130
out this destiny for you,
that's an empowering thing.

1755
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:38,131
That shit,
that shit will absolutely make you 

1756
01:25:38,131 --> 01:25:38,410
better things you say,
that's evidence of God.

1757
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:40,690
That's evidence that Jesus,
well maybe,

1758
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:45,870
but more likely it's evidence that 
you've put yourself in the exact proper 

1759
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:50,131
state of mind to achieve things by 
thinking positive and having positive 

1760
01:25:50,131 --> 01:25:52,810
energy and being a loving Christian by 
doing all those things.

1761
01:25:52,811 --> 01:25:57,160
You've put the good energy out there and
you've given yourself confidence because

1762
01:25:57,161 --> 01:26:02,161
you're doing the right thing and you've 
given yourself a strong belief in 

1763
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:04,100
yourself because you're following the 
right path and in doing that,

1764
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,860
that's very empowering.
That's how God is real.

1765
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:10,340
That's how religion is real,
but what it what it really all is at the

1766
01:26:10,341 --> 01:26:15,341
heart of it is you tuning in to the the 
correct frequency of the universe with 

1767
01:26:15,341 --> 01:26:19,961
the least amount of resistance,
the least amount of Latin amount of 

1768
01:26:19,961 --> 01:26:20,600
resistance from you.
The least amount of negative thinking,

1769
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:23,540
the least amount of meaning.
Like when I was a kid,

1770
01:26:23,541 --> 01:26:28,541
I'd get in arguments all the time with 
everybody about anything and really I 

1771
01:26:29,271 --> 01:26:31,550
was just a knucklehead.
I was just a dumb fuck,

1772
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:36,551
but I didn't realize that by doing that,
by creating all this drama in my life 

1773
01:26:36,551 --> 01:26:41,320
like I was,
it was just distracting the shit out of 

1774
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,590
me and it was keeping me from doing 
things that I wanted to do.

1775
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,800
He was keeping me from being happy and 
comfortable and friendly and it was 

1776
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,341
keeping me from like I was constantly in
a state of causing trouble and causing 

1777
01:26:51,381 --> 01:26:56,381
drama and creating all these obstacles 
in my own life and I didn't realize it 

1778
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:58,610
at the time and I always thought of 
people that were religious.

1779
01:26:58,610 --> 01:27:01,520
Like I just thought,
well there's got to be a lot of power in

1780
01:27:01,521 --> 01:27:06,521
that because like I was afraid of a dude
who was a religious who was on one of 

1781
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,840
the USAA taekwondo teens back when I was
fighting.

1782
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:12,830
There was this dude,
I think his name was Bobby Clayton and I

1783
01:27:12,831 --> 01:27:15,950
think that's his name,
but he wasn't the best guy,

1784
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:19,130
but he was crazy religious and that used
to scare the shit out of me.

1785
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,660
This dude used to read the Bible every 
day and this dude was like super,

1786
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:28,661
super,
super religious and he really believed 

1787
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:28,661
that himself and I was,
you know,

1788
01:27:28,661 --> 01:27:32,410
not very religious and even though I was
doing really well in these tournaments 

1789
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:32,410
and I was,
you know,

1790
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:36,850
beating a lot of really good guys.
There was something about this dude and 

1791
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:37,730
his religion that scared me,
like on paper,

1792
01:27:37,890 --> 01:27:39,410
he shouldn't have been the scariest guy 
to me,

1793
01:27:39,411 --> 01:27:41,240
but he was,
for whatever reason,

1794
01:27:41,241 --> 01:27:44,280
because this dude was really religious,
so for you know,

1795
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:49,570
that that belief that he had in himself,
that the belief in his faith and his 

1796
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:51,690
[inaudible],
all that shit was,

1797
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,840
is empowering to him and I recognized 
that it was empowering to him that he 

1798
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:56,840
was really legit about it.

1799
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,060
And then he was his super religious 
behavior.

1800
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,060
Like he was never.
He never swore he didn't drink,

1801
01:28:02,061 --> 01:28:04,940
he was friendly to everyone.
He was like really,

1802
01:28:04,941 --> 01:28:07,870
really,
really dedicated and that was,

1803
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:12,470
that made me nervous.
I think religion is empowering.

1804
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:17,800
Brian has been a huge advocate of 
scientology ever since he moved to Ohio.

1805
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:19,270
Right.

1806
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,670
Tell us about your experiences with 
scientology.

1807
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,710
They're sluts,
they're easy,

1808
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:30,110
they're real easy to sleep with.
Just have to trick them in a lot of 

1809
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:32,410
positive energy and stuff like that.
Yeah,

1810
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,370
and you just take their money and they 
sleep with you.

1811
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:36,490
That's great.
Do you hear that?

1812
01:28:37,510 --> 01:28:40,630
Is the scientology how a thing with 
fucking are a lot of fun?

1813
01:28:41,710 --> 01:28:43,720
I all it is.
No,

1814
01:28:43,721 --> 01:28:46,480
you don't definitely married or anything
and then I don't think so.

1815
01:28:46,510 --> 01:28:48,580
Yeah.
When any new religion comes around,

1816
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:51,610
you can be.
I'm not saying he's lying.

1817
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:57,610
I think if I had to pick one religion,
like if you had to do it,

1818
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:57,850
I'd

1819
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:00,280
be Buddhist.
Yeah,

1820
01:29:00,281 --> 01:29:02,040
that seems like the one that makes

1821
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:04,710
the most sense.
But the problem with being a Buddhist is

1822
01:29:04,711 --> 01:29:06,240
you've got to hang around with a bunch 
of fucking.

1823
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:09,570
He's a bunch of people who are 
pretending to be Buddhists,

1824
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:11,460
you know?
Yeah.

1825
01:29:11,461 --> 01:29:13,200
They always smelly feet.
Yeah.

1826
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:15,600
It looks like it's like the idea of 
hippies.

1827
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:19,830
It's all good on paper,
but the real problem with hippies is,

1828
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:21,210
you know,
they don't want to work.

1829
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,760
They're fucking lazy and stupid.
A lot of them.

1830
01:29:23,761 --> 01:29:24,330
And then,
you know,

1831
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:27,510
it's like the stereotypes of the pot 
smoking,

1832
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:28,800
Lazy,
you know,

1833
01:29:29,570 --> 01:29:31,830
a Ne'er do wells.
Like that's,

1834
01:29:31,950 --> 01:29:36,950
that's like accurate.
And a lot of ways that's the real 

1835
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:36,950
problem with hippies.
You know,

1836
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,960
what's Buddhist women look like?
I don't think I've ever seen a bit of 

1837
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:41,960
school.
I'm doing good.

1838
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:45,240
Vegetarians are really.
Did they have like about heads orange 

1839
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,600
robes,
gentleman.

1840
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:49,770
I gotta take a shit again so I can't 
believe this.

1841
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:52,680
We aid sausage subs this local place 
down the street.

1842
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,870
They're a little bit too strong,
too powerful.

1843
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:59,900
Five hundred 24 viewers.
I appreciate this and I will be only a 

1844
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:03,620
couple minutes,
but Brian will answer questions while 

1845
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:03,620
I'm gone.
I'll be gone for a couple minutes.

1846
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:03,620
My bathroom is right down here.
I'll be right back.

1847
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:06,510
All right.
What's the chemicals

1848
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:12,740
or a bod rail you asked what the 
chemical structure on Joe's shirt?

1849
01:30:12,741 --> 01:30:15,830
On the spike comedy central.
Ask questions.

1850
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:17,710
You can ask questions.
I'll answer them.

1851
01:30:18,250 --> 01:30:20,810
What I'm saying.
That's DMT though.

1852
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:26,600
Those sale and no shirts will be for 
sale soon.

1853
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:28,400
Uh,
Joe have it on his website.

1854
01:30:28,401 --> 01:30:31,280
They're trying to get the website 
together to sell.

1855
01:30:31,281 --> 01:30:33,740
He's going to have a whole bunch of 
different kinds of shirts and clothing I

1856
01:30:33,741 --> 01:30:36,200
guess.
So that'll be coming soon.

1857
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:44,070
It's a whole clothing line.
Do you get ever get tired of all these 

1858
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:48,960
stupid people asking you about drugs?
I think he just,

1859
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:54,080
you just get tired of stupid people.
They don't care about drugs now.

1860
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:55,180
He doesn't get tenure.

1861
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:08,320
What else?

1862
01:31:09,070 --> 01:31:14,070
A lot of the same questions.
Uh,

1863
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:20,070
have you ever heard of Uri Geller?
That's not the point of the same ones.

1864
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:23,640
Psychic psychic.
There you go.

1865
01:31:25,410 --> 01:31:27,930
Should I take dmt?
No.

1866
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,100
You should not take dmt.
If you're asking joe on a twitter,

1867
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:40,040
if you're a are alien or aliens among 
us.

1868
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:49,910
Yes.
They're Asian based.

1869
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:52,190
It all aliens are Asians.
Yeah.

1870
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:58,450
I think all aliens or Asian or some kind
of breed of Asian because they were just

1871
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
technology than us.
Regular white people were more caveman.

1872
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,290
They're more alien.
See,

1873
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,010
let's go back to your Rogan and board 
forums dot Joe Rogan.net.

1874
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:17,980
There's a whole thread with people 
asking questions on there.

1875
01:32:17,981 --> 01:32:21,750
Also,
I can.

1876
01:32:21,780 --> 01:32:24,270
Can you views you stream over the 
iphone?

1877
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:25,470
Yeah,
I believe so.

1878
01:32:28,610 --> 01:32:30,950
It's probably only good if you use Wifi.

1879
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:36,820
Yeah.

1880
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:40,240
What's the best place you ever done 
standup?

1881
01:32:40,910 --> 01:32:44,270
There's no one best place of my favorite
places or Austin,

1882
01:32:44,271 --> 01:32:49,271
Texas fireplaces or Austin,
Texas Delphia,

1883
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:52,460
Phoenix,
Arizona,

1884
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:53,600
Phoenix,
Arizona,

1885
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:56,090
San Francisco,
New York,

1886
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,010
La,
San Francisco to go to new employees,

1887
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,740
Columbus,
Ohio.

1888
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,610
Uh,

1889
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:26,670
any updates on brock lesnar's health is.
Everyone's asking to take a long time.

1890
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:34,020
He hasn't heard anything new.
It's going to take a long time for them 

1891
01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:35,710
to sort all that out apparently is a 
pretty serious condition that you have

1892
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:38,030
right?
Band,

1893
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,120
you seem to be pretty much up on 
technology.

1894
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:43,900
What's the single piece of technology or
equipment that would be available to the

1895
01:33:43,901 --> 01:33:46,180
public you're most excited about in 
2010?

1896
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:50,020
I think a lot of people who know me,
I'm excited for the new apple,

1897
01:33:50,430 --> 01:33:55,430
a tablet,
like an oversized iphone because I net,

1898
01:33:55,510 --> 01:34:00,510
net books are so popular right now and I
just find that that's just going to be 

1899
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:04,951
what's next.
After net books and iphones back just 

1900
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:08,370
took another tremendous shit.
Oh,

1901
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:13,740
sorry.
Brian said,

1902
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:17,710
my shit stinks,
which we know what to expect,

1903
01:34:17,711 --> 01:34:19,360
man.
Isn't that bad?

1904
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:20,460
Alright,
I'll,

1905
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:22,660
I'll try to enjoy to like it.
All right.

1906
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:24,670
Oh,
that's great.

1907
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,910
You're faking it.
Yeah.

1908
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,170
I'm thinking it.
Why?

1909
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:31,840
I shouldn't have to fake it.
I shouldn't just act like it's mine.

1910
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:33,340
Yeah.
Why don't you do that?

1911
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:34,420
Okay.
It's mine.

1912
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:35,380
No,
it doesn't work.

1913
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:37,390
It's so stupid.
It should work.

1914
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:38,930
Yeah.
You can trick yourself.

1915
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:43,660
What do we got here?

1916
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:46,720
Uh,

1917
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,850
thank you.
Twitter turned out on this page.

1918
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,050
Would you see that cloud just blew 
through the wrong.

1919
01:34:56,530 --> 01:34:57,220
Her refresh

1920
01:35:03,550 --> 01:35:08,550
shows your stomach or you burke?
We just added this Italian place down 

1921
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,450
the street.
Tremendous sausage and pepper sub.

1922
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,640
You get to like an east coast sausage 
and pepper.

1923
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:19,830
Seven la.
Was it called Cavalry Camera Ready?

1924
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:20,450
Something like that.

1925
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,820
Good fellows.
Posters were in there.

1926
01:35:26,280 --> 01:35:28,630
Okay.
Questions.

1927
01:35:28,631 --> 01:35:32,290
Do you ripe wipe from the front to back 
or back to front?

1928
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:34,810
That's a good question.
I never thought about that.

1929
01:35:35,170 --> 01:35:37,620
I'm a dude and I'm wiping my ass.
Not Like Regina.

1930
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:40,420
So I guess front to back.
Do you stand up?

1931
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,290
Yes.
Yeah,

1932
01:35:42,440 --> 01:35:43,510
totally.
Do you know,

1933
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:46,350
were rare.
Most people sit down when they white,

1934
01:35:46,390 --> 01:35:48,640
they can't get the job by now.
I don't understand it.

1935
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:49,960
Also.
Uh,

1936
01:35:50,470 --> 01:35:54,760
you said you always piece sitting there.
That's kind of how dare you.

1937
01:35:55,990 --> 01:36:00,990
I dare you.
I'll tell you something about my toilet 

1938
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:00,990
though,
that you probably didn't want to know,

1939
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:00,990
but you probably already know if you 
follow me on twitter,

1940
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:01,450
you can.
First of all,

1941
01:36:01,451 --> 01:36:04,420
you can't flush those flushable wipes.
That's bullshit.

1942
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:06,310
They say you can flush those things.
Yeah,

1943
01:36:06,311 --> 01:36:11,311
they'll disappear,
but they're going to clog up your 

1944
01:36:11,311 --> 01:36:11,311
fucking toilet.

1945
01:36:11,311 --> 01:36:11,311
It was those flushable wipes that you 
get.

1946
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:13,690
You got to use just 12.
You've been getting the dis.

1947
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:15,850
The flushable kind of disposable kind.
Yeah,

1948
01:36:15,851 --> 01:36:20,851
but they're not,
they're not flushing because I love 

1949
01:36:20,851 --> 01:36:22,711
first month of using those.
I thought they were all flushable and 

1950
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:22,711
then I saw that little picture on the 
back.

1951
01:36:22,711 --> 01:36:25,480
I'm like,
clogged the shit out of your toilet.

1952
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:28,540
But mine.
Mine got clogged up and they had to come

1953
01:36:28,541 --> 01:36:31,300
and fucking clean it out.
Rest you had crossed a lot of money.

1954
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:35,020
But the big thing is that I have fucking
plant growing in my toilet.

1955
01:36:35,021 --> 01:36:36,490
Yeah.
You saw that Shit,

1956
01:36:36,491 --> 01:36:38,050
right?
It was ridiculous.

1957
01:36:38,051 --> 01:36:41,090
It was a gigantic tree that was growing 
in my toilet.

1958
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:44,560
They found roots and they pulled it out 
and I put it up on twitter.

1959
01:36:44,740 --> 01:36:47,200
I think a lot of people have seen it.
I'm sure.

1960
01:36:48,820 --> 01:36:50,850
I'll see if I can find it.
I'll throw the link back up.

1961
01:36:51,150 --> 01:36:54,190
Maybe something like flicker page.
I mean it was so ridiculous.

1962
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:56,950
I mean it was so ridiculous that I 
looked at it and I was like,

1963
01:36:56,980 --> 01:37:01,090
how the fuck was that growing inside my 
toilet?

1964
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:05,250
But I guess it was the water.
You need to start updating your flicker.

1965
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:06,610
Right?

1966
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:11,880
My photo stream.
I must've had it after.

1967
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:13,500
I know I had it on twit pic.
Right.

1968
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:15,960
Maybe that's where it was.
Yeah.

1969
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:22,060
These are my.
No in Colorado photos.

1970
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:23,190
Yeah.
Something here.

1971
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:25,930
Put it up.
Let me start again.

1972
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:29,040
Twitter.
Twitter is twitter.

1973
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:29,380
Twitter.

1974
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:34,970
Yeah.
Music and hearing now,

1975
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:40,550
why not?
That's against the law.

1976
01:37:41,010 --> 01:37:43,310
What is it?
You're streaming music.

1977
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:45,670
If I do this and I have music playing in
the background,

1978
01:37:45,671 --> 01:37:47,200
we can't do it.
Could be arrested.

1979
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:50,540
Come on.
Really?

1980
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:53,950
This isn't a topic,
you know,

1981
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:57,160
that's the problem with using all these 
different goddamn programs.

1982
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:02,780
Why frog or I don't know what the other 
one is or how the other one works so 

1983
01:38:02,780 --> 01:38:04,910
fucked up when find picture back then 
your twitter.

1984
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,150
You find it for you guys.

1985
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:09,430
Toilet tree.

1986
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:21,870
I don't even know the fucking photo is.
No,

1987
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,480
I have to go to iphone photo and I 
apologize this.

1988
01:38:24,490 --> 01:38:26,380
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not very entertaining,

1989
01:38:26,381 --> 01:38:28,120
isn't it?
You don't even give a fuck.

1990
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:29,710
You don't give a fuck.
When you see the picture though,

1991
01:38:29,711 --> 01:38:34,711
the pictures are so ridiculous to.
This goddamn thing was actually grown 

1992
01:38:34,711 --> 01:38:35,660
inside my toilet bowl.
It seems like it's not going to be worth

1993
01:38:35,661 --> 01:38:37,720
the wages.
Google toilet tree,

1994
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:39,360
Joe Rogan.
It'll be out there in zinc.

1995
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:44,410
So yeah,
fairness here.

1996
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:07,690
This motherfucker can mean.
Come on man.

1997
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,710
Look at that fucking thing.
That shit's ridiculous.

1998
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:14,090
I've got to show you guys.
This shit is goes.

1999
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:27,410
It looks like.
I'm like,

2000
01:39:27,411 --> 01:39:31,660
I was mumbling so it doesn't even look 
real.

2001
01:39:32,350 --> 01:39:36,520
It looks completely fake.
So now go back to flicker,

2002
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:42,240
upload their shit.
This is,

2003
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:53,850
it's going to be hard for this picture 
to live up to the hype of fiddling 

2004
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:57,671
through my fucking computer.
Just trying to get this picture of you 

2005
01:39:57,671 --> 01:40:00,341
guys,
but once you get the picture I think 

2006
01:40:00,341 --> 01:40:02,711
you'll.
You'll appreciate what the fuck I'm 

2007
01:40:02,711 --> 01:40:04,001
saying because it's so ridiculous.
This thing was growing in my God damn 

2008
01:40:04,001 --> 01:40:04,001
toilet.

2009
01:40:04,001 --> 01:40:04,110
Weird.

2010
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:07,330
What the fuck?
Where is it?

2011
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:08,130
Explored it.

2012
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:26,510
It's uploading right

2013
01:40:34,340 --> 01:40:36,980
soon as it uploads.
I'll take the length.

2014
01:40:37,050 --> 01:40:39,890
My Internet is so weak.
Why have you done this yet?

2015
01:40:40,370 --> 01:40:42,080
I'm do.
Just make a call.

2016
01:40:42,081 --> 01:40:45,750
I'm a procrastinator.
Clearly make a phone call.

2017
01:40:45,751 --> 01:40:48,920
That's all you have to do.
I think I will even have a beer.

2018
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:50,190
What?
Sort of six slash one.

2019
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:53,580
So I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm going to do it and gentlemen,

2020
01:40:53,581 --> 01:40:54,040
a lot of people

2021
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,410
talk about upgrading the Internet.
I'm going to and do it.

2022
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:58,300
I'm going to do it for you guys

2023
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,080
because once you do that,
we could have separate cans.

2024
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:02,210
You know,
gonna have two cans,

2025
01:41:02,211 --> 01:41:04,950
we got a third cam.
If we need to show something else,

2026
01:41:06,330 --> 01:41:08,250
we have a third came.
Just be your desktop.

2027
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:12,180
So instead of having to upload all these
photos,

2028
01:41:12,181 --> 01:41:13,650
you could just show what's on your 
desktop.

2029
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,010
Why would I do that?
It's easier.

2030
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:19,970
That's getting whatever shop.
Okay.

2031
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:25,060
Here's the photo.
All sizes.

2032
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:31,480
Big Size Papi.

2033
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:37,450
Which bathroom is that when you hear 
Jesus?

2034
01:41:47,990 --> 01:41:52,990
Yeah.
What do you think about the mayweather 

2035
01:41:52,990 --> 01:41:53,320
pacman situation?
I think they're genius in minus 38.

2036
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:58,210
Really?
How twitter tweet?

2037
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:03,300
Tiny your eye.
Why isn't it just do it for your 

2038
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:03,300
parents.
Your mark

2039
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,600
tweet?
Because it's a WAC program.

2040
01:42:08,110 --> 01:42:13,110
She their twitter programs.
Why doesn't even shrink your urls or 

2041
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:16,150
thought that that would be a business?

2042
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,860
Yeah,
it's gotten big.

2043
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:20,770
We're getting a tiny url business.
What are you talking about?

2044
01:42:20,870 --> 01:42:22,240
Oh,
making people website names.

2045
01:42:22,241 --> 01:42:23,700
Really small.
Yeah.

2046
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,960
Who the fuck would ever thought there 
would be a market for that?

2047
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,190
One of the websites,
I can't remember.

2048
01:42:28,191 --> 01:42:33,191
I don't think it's tiny url,
but it's one of them like almost got 

2049
01:42:33,191 --> 01:42:36,530
bought the other day for like a couple 
million dollars and that's all it is.

2050
01:42:36,531 --> 01:42:39,290
Is that url short shorten.
That's hilarious.

2051
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:43,780
All right.
I put it up your fuckers.

2052
01:42:49,940 --> 01:42:51,110
That's another one that was grown.

2053
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:54,970
All right.
Sorry for the long delay.

2054
01:42:55,090 --> 01:43:00,090
That was ridiculous.
It wasn't even that interesting but it 

2055
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:00,090
is kinda interesting.
I,

2056
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:02,110
I put the picture up.
You can go see the picture.

2057
01:43:02,111 --> 01:43:06,030
It's on my twitter.
What's next?

2058
01:43:06,031 --> 01:43:08,520
After a weekly Rogan podcast and the 
book.

2059
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,040
What's the next project?
There are no next projects.

2060
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,140
This is about,
it isn't about all.

2061
01:43:13,141 --> 01:43:18,141
We're going to do a weekly podcast.
We're doing a show for Sony was going to

2062
01:43:18,421 --> 01:43:21,090
be called a l,
F,

2063
01:43:21,091 --> 01:43:21,930
m,
a o,

2064
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:23,390
but now we might have to call it 
something different.

2065
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:28,620
Yeah,
because I was trying to do it for like 

2066
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:28,620
two years and now there's a band called

2067
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:33,250
mail or something like that.
Their clothes will come up with a name 

2068
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:36,901
for it,
but it's basically a interviewing 

2069
01:43:36,901 --> 01:43:36,901
comedians about the creative process.
And,

2070
01:43:36,901 --> 01:43:41,551
uh,
we're also enter in the middle of a 

2071
01:43:41,551 --> 01:43:44,970
coming up with another show that uh,
it's comedy related to I can't talk 

2072
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:47,080
about,
but it should be fun.

2073
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:50,170
That and just more shows,
more comedy,

2074
01:43:50,770 --> 01:43:52,270
more good stuff.
Is fear factor

2075
01:43:52,290 --> 01:43:53,590
returning anytime?
Oh,

2076
01:43:53,830 --> 01:43:57,320
it's not.
I know there was a rumor that.

2077
01:43:57,321 --> 01:43:58,660
No.
Oh yeah,

2078
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:01,190
there was a rumor for a while they were 
going to try to bring fear factor back.

2079
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:02,990
This fear factor when they canceled it 
was like,

2080
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,440
it was kinda like they could have kept 
going if they really want.

2081
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:07,190
That's a show that could come back 
easily,

2082
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:11,780
do that shit.
And if you did it without me didn't have

2083
01:44:11,781 --> 01:44:16,781
the flavor,
I'm sure it would probably be great if 

2084
01:44:16,781 --> 01:44:16,781
they did.
It was like Mario Lopez.

2085
01:44:16,781 --> 01:44:20,300
No,
you can't pass up on that easy money.

2086
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,400
Especially if you're working with all 
the same people again and stuff.

2087
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:26,150
I might be willing to

2088
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,940
just for my kids just put money away.
What's your movie coming on?

2089
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:31,800
Uh,
October.

2090
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:33,930
Damn.
October.

2091
01:44:33,990 --> 01:44:37,320
Should I move to Colorado?
I loved Colorado Man sideshow.

2092
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,660
Sit said should I move to it?
I fucking loved it.

2093
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:42,220
I would still be there.
I didn't mind the cold.

2094
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,060
I liked the people.
I liked the sky.

2095
01:44:45,061 --> 01:44:48,000
I like the way the fucking mountains 
looked.

2096
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:50,490
I liked the vibe.
I liked everything about it.

2097
01:44:50,491 --> 01:44:53,220
I liked it for me creatively.
I liked living in Colorado,

2098
01:44:53,940 --> 01:44:58,140
but when you have a family,
you have children,

2099
01:44:58,141 --> 01:45:03,141
you have a wife and it's not as.
It's not as easy as just me being by 

2100
01:45:03,141 --> 01:45:03,141
myself.
It was,

2101
01:45:03,141 --> 01:45:04,950
it was just me by myself.
I'd probably still be there.

2102
01:45:04,951 --> 01:45:09,000
I still be on the top of that mountain,
but she was not into it.

2103
01:45:09,060 --> 01:45:11,610
It's just too creepy.
When our dog got eaten,

2104
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,200
our dog had eaten by mountain line.

2105
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:17,730
That's not like a rumor that actually 
happened.

2106
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,900
Dog had eaten by mountain lions and uh,
she's bad driving in snow.

2107
01:45:21,901 --> 01:45:24,810
She crashed the car,
so it was a couple of different things.

2108
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:29,990
And then she got pregnant and the 
pregnancy was the biggest reason why we 

2109
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:32,130
had to move out of Colorado.
It was because we were living over 8,000

2110
01:45:32,131 --> 01:45:34,770
feet above sea level.
It's really hot.

2111
01:45:34,771 --> 01:45:37,770
It's like three.
We are 3000 feet above boulder and it is

2112
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:42,780
really,
really high altitude and when you're 

2113
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:42,780
pregnant it's just brutal.
It really,

2114
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:45,510
it's not good for you.
It's unhealthy for you and for the baby.

2115
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:50,680
Colorado is like one of the highest 
states in the country that one of the 

2116
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:54,981
top states in the country when it comes 
to premature births and a lot of it is 

2117
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:55,830
because the altitude just.
You don't get enough air up there.

2118
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:57,480
It's just,
it's great for your conditioning,

2119
01:45:57,481 --> 01:46:02,481
but it's not,
not so good for from being a pregnant 

2120
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:02,481
woman.

2121
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:04,560
So all those factors I had to move out 
to Colorado,

2122
01:46:04,561 --> 01:46:07,810
but if I could just be somewhere and 
live somewhere live in Colorado.

2123
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:09,030
Oh,
in a heartbeat.

2124
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:12,210
If I didn't have to travel,
stay in Colorado and you know,

2125
01:46:12,211 --> 01:46:14,580
deal with snow when it comes to your 
fucking snowed in.

2126
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,560
No big deal.
That's what it's supposed to be like.

2127
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,800
A problem with me is I travel all the 
time so I would leave my wife and leave 

2128
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,450
the kids there.
It's not the same by myself.

2129
01:46:24,451 --> 01:46:26,100
I'd have no problem with it.
I loved it.

2130
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:28,980
So if you are going to move somewhere 
and stay there,

2131
01:46:28,981 --> 01:46:31,230
I would say yeah,
Colorado's fucking bad ass.

2132
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:36,650
That's my favorite state.
Do you think there will be a time when 

2133
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:38,490
all handheld access will have a pipe in 
them?

2134
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:43,700
Like the Tomahawk Tomahawks where there 
were a pipe and an ax all in one.

2135
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:48,900
Is that true?
If that's true,

2136
01:46:48,930 --> 01:46:53,930
the Indians were bad motherfuckers,
so I think that did just went to a 

2137
01:46:53,930 --> 01:46:57,290
renaissance festival getting carried 
away because I mean if you think about,

2138
01:46:57,310 --> 01:46:58,950
if it was a pipe also,
listen,

2139
01:46:58,951 --> 01:47:00,630
this is the beauty of the Internet right
now.

2140
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:03,300
We'll google this.
Did Tomahawks have pipes on?

2141
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:05,050
I think there might've been a couple 
that did,

2142
01:47:05,051 --> 01:47:07,740
but I don't think the majority of it.
I speculate.

2143
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:08,870
Let's find out.
Okay.

2144
01:47:08,871 --> 01:47:13,871
I just doesn't seem right.
It seems like it would just make that 

2145
01:47:13,871 --> 01:47:15,480
the weapon weaker,
having a hole through the middle of it.

2146
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:17,580
Yeah,
that's true.

2147
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:20,190
That's a good point.
Maybe it's enough.

2148
01:47:22,790 --> 01:47:24,200
Yeah.
Hype,

2149
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:24,890
Tomahawk.

2150
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:29,980
That's a pipe axes.

2151
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:33,490
The crazy crow trading post.

2152
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:38,300
Show me a pipe backs these pipes

2153
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:44,470
pipe historically accurate pipe axes.
We have spent years researching and 

2154
01:47:44,511 --> 01:47:48,200
manufacturing the finest line of 
throwing Tomahawks pipe,

2155
01:47:48,201 --> 01:47:51,800
Tomahawks belt and camp ax is available 
today.

2156
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:54,380
Did you even know there was a market for
that kind of Shit?

2157
01:47:55,190 --> 01:47:56,750
That's the beautiful thing about the 
Internet.

2158
01:47:57,130 --> 01:47:59,540
Let's see what this thing looks like.
I don't see the pipe part.

2159
01:47:59,660 --> 01:48:04,660
Where's the pipe part?
Hand drill for smoking.

2160
01:48:05,711 --> 01:48:10,711
Wow.
Sounds like anytime forge iron had 

2161
01:48:10,711 --> 01:48:13,280
drilled for smoking.
So basically the pipe is this.

2162
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:18,460
You put some tobacco up in that bitch 
right there and you smoke right out of 

2163
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:18,460
there

2164
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:20,730
or do you smoke?
You smoke out of there.

2165
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:23,560
Wow.
Nick,

2166
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:27,920
the handle weaker in a weapon.
Weaker definitely would.

2167
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:32,960
Right,
but this seems like it's like really 

2168
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:35,061
hard would.
This one's got a metal piece through 

2169
01:48:35,061 --> 01:48:38,121
that original 1800 to 18.
Twenty five believed to belong to red 

2170
01:48:38,121 --> 01:48:39,360
cloud.
Wow.

2171
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:40,980
That's pretty dope.
Red Cloud in.

2172
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:42,810
Didn't think it out.
Dude.

2173
01:48:42,870 --> 01:48:46,140
I think we should start smoking pipe 
from a fucking Tomahawk.

2174
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:49,410
We're going to order one of those.
Come on man.

2175
01:48:49,411 --> 01:48:51,840
What'd you the podcast?
We'll smoke out of that.

2176
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
That's ladies and gentlemen.
What?

2177
01:48:54,001 --> 01:48:55,770
Say you on twitter?
I need to order this,

2178
01:48:55,771 --> 01:48:57,630
right?
I'm going to order this.

2179
01:48:57,690 --> 01:48:59,280
Add to basket.
Listen,

2180
01:48:59,340 --> 01:48:59,700
clerk.

2181
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:02,400
That's added to the basket.

2182
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:04,540
All right,
I'm going to check out now.

2183
01:49:04,541 --> 01:49:07,120
I'll check it out later because I don't 
want you guys to get bummed out at me.

2184
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:12,580
It was boring enough looking for that 
toilet tree coming up on two hours.

2185
01:49:12,581 --> 01:49:14,430
Which would make this two hours.
You think?

2186
01:49:14,610 --> 01:49:16,760
Why are you getting bored anymore?
No,

2187
01:49:16,850 --> 01:49:19,780
I just think we to keep it to you have 
to do another video.

2188
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:22,770
Someone doesn't think it's fun anymore.
All.

2189
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,840
Let's go back.

2190
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:27,900
Four hundred 71.
Motherfuckers in here.

2191
01:49:27,901 --> 01:49:30,270
We lost a lot of people for being really
boring.

2192
01:49:30,460 --> 01:49:33,360
Madison to I think is just about right.

2193
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,070
You want them wanting more?
Not less.

2194
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,230
Is that what we want?
Ladies and gentlemen.

2195
01:49:41,150 --> 01:49:41,810
Let's see.
Ryan.

2196
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:45,290
He correct two hours.
What is the.

2197
01:49:45,291 --> 01:49:50,291
Where's the time on top left?
Where they're getting light is right 

2198
01:49:50,291 --> 01:49:53,420
over here.
I think after two hours also it doesn't 

2199
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:58,150
save maybe or something.
I think as people start hating this bug,

2200
01:49:58,190 --> 01:50:01,720
it's got nothing to talk about.
Boring as shit.

2201
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:05,770
So,
so far we've answered questions.

2202
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:10,180
We put photos up on twitter,
we've talked about some heavy subjects.

2203
01:50:11,710 --> 01:50:12,640
Would more,
do you need that?

2204
01:50:12,641 --> 01:50:17,641
He's in gentlemen.
We're all living in an alien's petri 

2205
01:50:17,641 --> 01:50:20,230
dish.
Says Dawkins 20 maybe,

2206
01:50:21,130 --> 01:50:26,130
you know as possible.
Is time illusion shred for 31.

2207
01:50:26,801 --> 01:50:29,080
Wants to know if time's an illusion.
I don't think it's an illusion.

2208
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:31,630
I just don't think time is just one 
thing.

2209
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:34,370
You tell that the David Copperfield,
everything's.

2210
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:39,760
I think time is,
you know,

2211
01:50:40,350 --> 01:50:43,630
I mean we already know that time changes
when you go fast.

2212
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,390
Like if someone's in a super fast 
spaceship,

2213
01:50:46,840 --> 01:50:47,680
uh,
you know,

2214
01:50:47,681 --> 01:50:52,681
and they go at the speed of light,
like time goes by much quicker on earth 

2215
01:50:52,681 --> 01:50:56,341
and it doesn't in their plane.
So if they come back and they're super 

2216
01:50:56,341 --> 01:50:56,341
fast spaceship,
you know,

2217
01:50:56,341 --> 01:51:01,260
for them it's only been a year.
But for us it could be like 100 years 

2218
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,751
depending on how far and fast they go.
So time lose in a way that I don't,

2219
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:08,850
I don't,
I don't think it's the way we look at 

2220
01:51:08,850 --> 01:51:09,340
it.
I don't think it's as cut and dry.

2221
01:51:09,341 --> 01:51:10,480
Like,
you know,

2222
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:13,100
this is midnight and this is 1:00.
I think it's,

2223
01:51:14,440 --> 01:51:19,440
it's much more dependent upon the state 
that the human beings and like the 

2224
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,160
frequency of the persons in the world 
where the person's living,

2225
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:21,920
you know,
that you're,

2226
01:51:21,930 --> 01:51:23,240
you're living on earth,
you know,

2227
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:28,500
this dimension,
you know that there's the time varies 

2228
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:30,130
throughout other dimensions and you can 
access those dimensions.

2229
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:35,310
I mean if they really do come up with 
ships that can fly through space at 

2230
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:39,000
closest speed of light or something,
they really will be able to go to a 

2231
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,060
place where they're,
they're literally going forward in time.

2232
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:45,870
They'll have lived one year,
they come back to earth and hundreds of 

2233
01:51:45,870 --> 01:51:46,000
years have gone by.
That's just nutty shit.

2234
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:47,100
And that's real.
No,

2235
01:51:47,170 --> 01:51:52,170
I don't think we understand time enough.
I think Tom is one of those things that 

2236
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:52,990
we think we've got a grip I want.
It really is,

2237
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:56,980
but it's probably far more complex and 
confusing and variable than we think

2238
01:51:57,080 --> 01:52:02,080
I didn't use to get rid of daylight 
savings time because I think it's 

2239
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,040
bullshit that it's fucking pitch black 
outside and it's only 6:30.

2240
01:52:04,400 --> 01:52:05,750
Yes,
she's absolutely right.

2241
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:08,090
Farmers,
they're all fucking thief's.

2242
01:52:08,150 --> 01:52:10,990
What's,
how dare you.

2243
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:16,020
But seriously,
John Mellencamp hater back then it made 

2244
01:52:16,020 --> 01:52:16,620
sense because everybody was a farmer.
You know,

2245
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:18,800
everything has to do with farmers 
nowadays.

2246
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:20,860
Why didn't they just get up earlier to 
get it?

2247
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,690
I don't get everything.
It makes sense.

2248
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:25,130
I think,
you know,

2249
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:27,230
if you have a regular job,
you know,

2250
01:52:27,231 --> 01:52:32,231
sometimes it's dark out.
Sometimes it's light out the fucking 

2251
01:52:32,231 --> 01:52:32,231
earth span.
That's what I love about Arizona.

2252
01:52:32,231 --> 01:52:33,050
The Arizona,
they don't change their time.

2253
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:34,030
They're like fuck,

2254
01:52:34,210 --> 01:52:36,270
you know,
it's stupid.

2255
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,890
What they need to even do it better than
that.

2256
01:52:37,891 --> 01:52:42,891
They need to like really fuck it up.
Like I want it to be bright out till 

2257
01:52:42,891 --> 01:52:43,650
like nine to 10:00
at night.

2258
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:44,820
Don't you think?
That'd be cool.

2259
01:52:44,850 --> 01:52:46,010
Yeah.
But then it would be dark

2260
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:48,290
out until like noon here,
but that's fine.

2261
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:48,860
No.

2262
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:50,780
Oh,
that's retarded.

2263
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:54,070
Retarded is that.
It makes no sense.

2264
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:56,180
Most people would rather like to have a 
day.

2265
01:52:56,181 --> 01:53:01,181
Like most people would rather have 
daylight when you get off work and 

2266
01:53:01,621 --> 01:53:02,020
anything.

2267
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:05,730
I think that's silly.
It's silly.

2268
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:14,890
I spelled twitter long while my link.
I know I did.

2269
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:18,730
I don't think I could fix it though.
I think it's too late.

2270
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:22,690
It is.
It is what it is.

2271
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,310
No,
you don't get better.

2272
01:53:26,540 --> 01:53:28,740
What do you do that other program 
remember?

2273
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:29,510
Oh,
that's right.

2274
01:53:30,940 --> 01:53:33,630
That's this little motherfucker right 
here.

2275
01:53:33,790 --> 01:53:34,620
Check so shit

2276
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:36,570
right in the room.

2277
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:43,760
Yeah.
It's just understanding the whole thing.

2278
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,360
Why does it not show?
Because it's like two lines.

2279
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:49,670
You know what I mean?
Like if you hit the right button,

2280
01:53:56,030 --> 01:53:58,930
right?
Yeah.

2281
01:54:01,950 --> 01:54:06,950
Put a Joe live.
Yay.

2282
01:54:10,130 --> 01:54:13,930
High fix that shit.
It didn't change.

2283
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:15,560
Oh good.
Good.

2284
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,550
Mm hmm.

2285
01:54:23,910 --> 01:54:26,980
Scott is trying to be funny.
Steve whizzy trying to be funny.

2286
01:54:26,981 --> 01:54:28,480
Steve was.
He says,

2287
01:54:28,481 --> 01:54:29,730
besides Carlos,
when Sia.

2288
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:31,240
Who are your other favorite?

2289
01:54:33,110 --> 01:54:36,890
What does make sense being silly?
Goose.

2290
01:54:38,340 --> 01:54:40,950
Um,
my favorite comedians though for real.

2291
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:46,340
All right guys.
Well I look forward to seeing like Lucy 

2292
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:46,340
Kay,
uh,

2293
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:46,720
Dave attell.
Doug Stan Hope.

2294
01:54:46,721 --> 01:54:48,290
Definitely.
Um,

2295
01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:54,320
there's a cat williams.
See Him live.

2296
01:54:56,981 --> 01:54:57,910
I only seen him on video.

2297
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:03,050
Catlins is on TMZ yesterday.
Just got out of jail or something like 

2298
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:03,050
that.
And they,

2299
01:55:03,050 --> 01:55:07,330
they,
he got in a fight at a bar and he had a 

2300
01:55:07,330 --> 01:55:07,330
gun in his pocket.

2301
01:55:07,330 --> 01:55:07,330
Ah,
like it.

2302
01:55:07,900 --> 01:55:10,750
He's crazy.
That's crazy.

2303
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:13,060
He's crazy.
For Real.

2304
01:55:13,870 --> 01:55:17,140
I want to meet that dude.
I like his comedy.

2305
01:55:17,380 --> 01:55:22,380
I think he's very funny.
Do you ever listen to him on a grand 

2306
01:55:22,931 --> 01:55:24,190
theft auto?
No.

2307
01:55:24,350 --> 01:55:25,000
Good.
Yeah.

2308
01:55:25,780 --> 01:55:27,280
He does like the voice.
Well,

2309
01:55:27,281 --> 01:55:32,281
no,
they have a comedy club and grand theft 

2310
01:55:32,281 --> 01:55:32,950
auto.
I like it.

2311
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:44,940
If not telepathy.
What's next for Human Johnny Bananas?

2312
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:49,940
Twenty one wants to know boots for men 
if not telepathy.

2313
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:52,620
What?
Snacks for human evolution.

2314
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:57,890
Probably a reversal if not telepathy,
if we gonna I think we're in a race 

2315
01:55:58,621 --> 01:56:01,680
right now between technology and 
retards,

2316
01:56:01,681 --> 01:56:05,570
between technology and caveman style 
living,

2317
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:08,360
you know,
they're talking about invading Pakistan,

2318
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:11,100
veining,
Yemen and more war and more craziness.

2319
01:56:11,850 --> 01:56:12,770
You know,
we're at a,

2320
01:56:12,790 --> 01:56:17,790
a crossroads and I think we could either
get hit by a meteor or blow ourselves up

2321
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:24,680
or figure out the next level,
figure out what,

2322
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:29,760
what's going to take human beings from 
where we are to the next stage of 

2323
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:30,390
existence.
Which is like a real thing.

2324
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:32,520
I mean,
I think we're really going to evolve.

2325
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,920
We're really moving towards something 
new,

2326
01:56:35,310 --> 01:56:36,750
you know,
I think that's what this,

2327
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:40,200
this frantic fucking society we live in 
is all about.

2328
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:45,201
I think we're,
we're pushing and moving towards 

2329
01:56:45,201 --> 01:56:47,471
something all working together towards 
something and I think it's going to be 

2330
01:56:47,471 --> 01:56:48,180
technology driven,
so it's one of those things.

2331
01:56:48,181 --> 01:56:53,181
Either that's going to happen,
there's going to be some sort of a 

2332
01:56:53,181 --> 01:56:55,730
technologically birthed connection that 
all people all of a sudden share some 

2333
01:56:59,281 --> 01:57:00,090
sort of a,

2334
01:57:01,650 --> 01:57:04,020
some sort of a convergence of all human 
being.

2335
01:57:04,021 --> 01:57:09,021
It's either gonna be that or it's going 
to be blow ourselves up or a meteor 

2336
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:11,190
fucks us up or yellowstone explodes and 
we start from scratch.

2337
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:15,030
You know what if,
what if in the future,

2338
01:57:15,031 --> 01:57:19,550
the first robot to get pregnant?
Imagine,

2339
01:57:19,590 --> 01:57:24,590
imagine you figured out a way to get out
machines so closely tuned into human 

2340
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:26,550
beings that you can fuck them and get 
them pregnant.

2341
01:57:26,551 --> 01:57:31,551
Yeah,
I think that's very possible then don't 

2342
01:57:31,551 --> 01:57:32,670
you?
Anything's possible at this point.

2343
01:57:33,560 --> 01:57:35,970
That's not that crazy.
You know?

2344
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:41,030
I mean,
they can make so many things 

2345
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:41,030
artificially.
They figured out a way to make pork in a

2346
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:42,400
laboratory.
The actual,

2347
01:57:42,401 --> 01:57:44,270
the meat,
they can take some of the meat from,

2348
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:49,300
from a pig and then making a laboratory.
The problem is it's not really like 

2349
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:50,340
mushy because it doesn't exercise at all
and it's not like,

2350
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:55,341
it's not like taught sinew,
but they're trying to figure out a way 

2351
01:57:55,341 --> 01:57:55,800
to maybe electrically exercise the 
muscle.

2352
01:57:55,990 --> 01:57:59,790
You could literally like just make 
gigantic like rooms full of meat,

2353
01:58:00,060 --> 01:58:05,060
you know?
It doesn't even have a life attached to 

2354
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:05,060
it.
If they can do that,

2355
01:58:05,060 --> 01:58:05,970
if they can do that,
why can't they?

2356
01:58:05,971 --> 01:58:08,370
If they can figure out a way to grow 
meat,

2357
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,370
why can't they figure out a way to make 
an artificial human being

2358
01:58:12,410 --> 01:58:13,820
that's going to be just like blade 
runner though?

2359
01:58:13,821 --> 01:58:16,700
They're going to be all sad and shit.
Don't want to kill you.

2360
01:58:18,920 --> 01:58:23,870
You know you have to give emotions.
If you don't give them emotions,

2361
01:58:23,871 --> 01:58:26,990
then you know they can't relate to 
people.

2362
01:58:26,991 --> 01:58:31,991
They can't empathize with people and 
then just go on mad raping and killing 

2363
01:58:31,991 --> 01:58:33,760
sprees.
Because if you make artificial people,

2364
01:58:33,790 --> 01:58:36,440
if you make them,
when they get the hard ons and shit,

2365
01:58:37,130 --> 01:58:39,890
you know,
he has a boner.

2366
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,630
Our robots imagine.

2367
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:47,290
I mean if you make the females you make 
males to like for like old gay dudes,

2368
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:51,360
you know,
dudes and what you know,

2369
01:58:51,361 --> 01:58:56,170
like to have a robot fucked all right,
but gay dudes would want some robot gay.

2370
01:58:56,460 --> 01:59:00,820
Do you imagine if they could make a like
a real live like safe.

2371
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:04,720
There was a guy who was your neighbor 
who was really creepy and he was fixated

2372
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:09,721
on you and he make a robot that looks 
exactly like you and just fuck it all 

2373
01:59:09,721 --> 01:59:13,420
day long and punch it and tie it up and 
shit on its head and there's nothing you

2374
01:59:13,421 --> 01:59:18,421
can do about it.
So literally next door to your fucking 

2375
01:59:18,421 --> 01:59:18,550
house.
This guy's like putting that,

2376
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:20,590
the robot head out the window and waving
to you.

2377
01:59:20,591 --> 01:59:20,970
Look,
look,

2378
01:59:21,010 --> 01:59:24,370
I'm pissing his mouth and it's like you.
But it's a fake you.

2379
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:26,530
And he's just fucking it up all day.

2380
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:32,220
How disturbing with that be?
There's nothing you can do about it 

2381
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:32,220
because you have the papers on this.
It's not a real human sir.

2382
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:33,550
And they chose the papers.
Okay.

2383
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:35,140
I guess it's a robot.
I mean,

2384
01:59:35,141 --> 01:59:36,340
if it's a robot,
right?

2385
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:38,590
Look,
if I have a grappling dummy in my,

2386
01:59:38,610 --> 01:59:40,810
uh,
in my garage that I use in my practice,

2387
01:59:40,811 --> 01:59:42,310
my Jujitsu,
you know,

2388
01:59:42,311 --> 01:59:44,700
and you could practice positions on it.
It's like it's a,

2389
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:47,500
it's called the above a dummy to Gracie.
You could buy it from,

2390
01:59:47,501 --> 01:59:47,990
uh,
the,

2391
01:59:47,991 --> 01:59:48,570
the,
the,

2392
01:59:48,600 --> 01:59:50,770
the,
the Gracie Academy in Torrance.

2393
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,310
They're,
they,

2394
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:53,230
they're the ones who start selling 
another website.

2395
01:59:53,231 --> 01:59:55,630
I forget what the website is,
but if you look above a dummy,

2396
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:58,000
it's a dummy that's just designed for 
Jujitsu.

2397
01:59:58,210 --> 02:00:03,210
And we filmed once playing around.
Remember we're in the yard and in the 

2398
02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:06,810
garage.
We were beating the shit out of it and 

2399
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:06,810
kick it in.
What if that was a real person?

2400
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:06,810
I mean,
it's a dummy that we made,

2401
02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:10,060
but what if it's a robot person?
What if there's like a robot person that

2402
02:00:10,061 --> 02:00:12,280
you could practice Jujitsu on?
You can rape them.

2403
02:00:12,470 --> 02:00:15,310
Who could punch him in the face?
You could just beat the shit out of me.

2404
02:00:15,311 --> 02:00:20,311
You could chop his arms off.
He'd be screaming and yelling and the 

2405
02:00:20,311 --> 02:00:20,311
cops come to go,
look,

2406
02:00:20,311 --> 02:00:20,311
it's a fake person.

2407
02:00:20,311 --> 02:00:24,720
You ever been there?
The laws would have to probably change 

2408
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:27,250
that.
Artificial intelligence is just the 

2409
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:27,250
same,
you know,

2410
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:28,080
because then I mean,
yeah,

2411
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:30,610
because I mean a dog isn't as smart as a
human,

2412
02:00:30,611 --> 02:00:31,320
but don't.
You're not going to.

2413
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:36,360
You're allowed to chop the dog's legs 
off and stuff like a robot that has 

2414
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:40,470
artificial intelligence.
It's still going to be considered 

2415
02:00:40,470 --> 02:00:40,470
artificial intelligence,
I think.

2416
02:00:40,470 --> 02:00:44,900
Yeah,
but do you think that they'll treat it 

2417
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:44,900
the same way as a human being?
Like the laws?

2418
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:45,170
It'll be like murder,

2419
02:00:45,300 --> 02:00:46,220
right?
I think if it's.

2420
02:00:46,240 --> 02:00:48,890
If it can think it's going to be 
considered life,

2421
02:00:48,950 --> 02:00:52,910
but before they figured that out,
there's going to be a couple of years of

2422
02:00:52,911 --> 02:00:54,610
masturbating,
extra staffing,

2423
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:59,190
have a direct replica of you and he's 
gonna fuck.

2424
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,050
It's right in front of your window.
It's going to blow an air heart.

2425
02:01:02,870 --> 02:01:05,140
I look out the window.
What the fuck is he doing?

2426
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:09,600
You looked at these fucking your head 
and you think about it,

2427
02:01:09,601 --> 02:01:10,470
like,
what if that was me?

2428
02:01:10,790 --> 02:01:15,510
What if I was the duplicate and the real
me was watching me get raped.

2429
02:01:18,150 --> 02:01:19,890
It's weird shit.
That could be real.

2430
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:22,740
That could be real.
That could really be a possibility.

2431
02:01:22,770 --> 02:01:27,770
You know?
What I'm surprised is that there's not 

2432
02:01:27,770 --> 02:01:29,361
technology yet where we can.
I could have a program and type out shit

2433
02:01:29,940 --> 02:01:32,130
and make it sound exactly like you.
Like,

2434
02:01:32,150 --> 02:01:35,220
you know,
like your voice can do the exact levels.

2435
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:38,190
So like you could prank call with your 
mom and stuff like that.

2436
02:01:38,191 --> 02:01:39,800
Is there should be that or it shouldn't 
be that.

2437
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:40,310
Totally.

2438
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:42,170
Yeah.
Why haven't they figured that out?

2439
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:43,280
It seems easy.
You know,

2440
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:45,890
it's really ridiculous too,
is that you still have to sign things.

2441
02:01:45,891 --> 02:01:47,660
You scribble their name.

2442
02:01:47,970 --> 02:01:52,970
Yeah.
This is stupid because I write taco 

2443
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:52,970
penis.
I don't even care.

2444
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:54,280
They don't look at it and it'll check 
your id.

2445
02:01:54,281 --> 02:01:54,490
This.

2446
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:55,620
No,
no.

2447
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:58,480
I don't sign my credit cards.
I guess if you could look at my driver's

2448
02:01:58,481 --> 02:02:03,481
license,
I scribbled my name on that and it's a 

2449
02:02:03,481 --> 02:02:05,301
similar level,
but what are these fucking people that 

2450
02:02:05,301 --> 02:02:06,190
work at the target or they scribble 
experts can look at that scribble.

2451
02:02:06,191 --> 02:02:07,870
I Dunno.
It's just not the same guy.

2452
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:10,750
Sometimes I write full sentences.
Honest to God.

2453
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:14,290
Yeah.
It's ridiculous.

2454
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:16,620
How is that still around?
Right.

2455
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:19,180
Something with your name and that's 
legally binding.

2456
02:02:19,570 --> 02:02:21,730
If you write something with your name,
you know what I mean?

2457
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:25,730
Like you know when I got married I had 
to get a marriage certificate and had to

2458
02:02:25,731 --> 02:02:27,610
write,
scribble and that's it.

2459
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:30,350
That's what ties you up now when you 
wrote void.

2460
02:02:30,770 --> 02:02:31,900
See,
I wouldn't do that.

2461
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:37,260
I would write.
This is not real and scribble because 

2462
02:02:37,260 --> 02:02:38,990
then she has a gun head.
If I get a divorce I got.

2463
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:42,110
If you could see I wrote this is not 
void on it.

2464
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:45,270
I wonder if that was enough.
Valid.

2465
02:02:45,690 --> 02:02:46,500
I don't know.
Maybe.

2466
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:50,630
Maybe you could say it's like shit.
Then I could say,

2467
02:02:50,631 --> 02:02:53,480
well we have a.
We have the documents you sign.

2468
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:54,800
Then you can look at and go,
look what I wrote.

2469
02:02:54,840 --> 02:02:56,870
Yeah.
It says this is not real.

2470
02:02:57,040 --> 02:02:58,310
You know,
been married.

2471
02:02:58,550 --> 02:03:00,830
Maybe just sign.
I do not agree to this.

2472
02:03:00,860 --> 02:03:03,980
I'm a gun is being held up to my hair 
color.

2473
02:03:04,750 --> 02:03:08,950
They have my dog hostage.
Robots will have rights after awhile,

2474
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:13,980
so yeah,
that's a guy I watched that will smith 

2475
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:13,980
movie ai,
ai,

2476
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:17,850
ai.
So they need to make an ai maybe like 

2477
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:17,850
with the kid like sex.
Was it?

2478
02:03:17,850 --> 02:03:20,150
I am robot robot.
That was.

2479
02:03:20,330 --> 02:03:21,680
That was pretty good moment.
That's a good movie.

2480
02:03:22,640 --> 02:03:27,640
Everything was Mac.
Remember all the robots look like Max 

2481
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:27,640
does.

2482
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:31,750
Gilbert.
It will have a chance against those 

2483
02:03:31,750 --> 02:03:31,750
Santos.
This guy's talking about UFC.

2484
02:03:32,110 --> 02:03:37,110
This is that.
When you leave you won't talk about UFC 

2485
02:03:37,110 --> 02:03:37,700
will answer one UFC question.
Yes,

2486
02:03:37,701 --> 02:03:38,930
he does.
Gilbert arrivals.

2487
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:41,830
Dangerous.
He's a really good striker,

2488
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:45,830
dangerous motherfucker and he knows 
there's a big opportunity for him.

2489
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:47,750
He's going to come charge and guns 
blazing.

2490
02:03:47,810 --> 02:03:52,810
Don't you think it's stupid when people 
ask you is going to win that fight 

2491
02:03:52,810 --> 02:03:52,810
because obviously it's a fight for a 
reason.

2492
02:03:52,810 --> 02:03:55,190
Meaning that there's not an obvious 
winner of this fight,

2493
02:03:55,191 --> 02:03:56,930
so most of the time it's not an obvious 
winner,

2494
02:03:56,931 --> 02:04:01,931
but most of the time,
I mean there's a lot of the times when 

2495
02:04:01,931 --> 02:04:02,240
when everybody agrees that a certain guy
going to win,

2496
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:03,800
I mean,
it doesn't mean that you're right,

2497
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:09,250
but in this fight,
this guy doesn't know that much about 

2498
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:09,250
this Gilbert Ivo guy probably and 
wonders.

2499
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:10,980
I think Gilbert's got a real good chance
he's.

2500
02:04:10,981 --> 02:04:12,770
He's dangerous.
If he trains hard,

2501
02:04:12,771 --> 02:04:14,680
if he's in real good shape,
he's very,

2502
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:19,700
very dangerous.
He knocks a lot of guys out his out of 

2503
02:04:19,700 --> 02:04:21,530
Gary Goodrich and pride was one of the 
most spectacular knockouts ever.

2504
02:04:22,070 --> 02:04:23,810
Head kicked him.
Boom.

2505
02:04:23,840 --> 02:04:28,840
One shot,
like 10 seconds of the fight and put 

2506
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:29,630
them to sleep.
He's questions that you can ask a dog to

2507
02:04:29,631 --> 02:04:34,631
bark once for yes and two for no,
and it had the same percentage of the 

2508
02:04:34,631 --> 02:04:34,960
outcome of the question in the answer 
that,

2509
02:04:34,970 --> 02:04:36,680
you know what I mean?
Like if you say,

2510
02:04:36,681 --> 02:04:37,920
yeah,
that going to win,

2511
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,290
someone's going to win.
Right?

2512
02:04:40,350 --> 02:04:45,350
But someone's.
I'll also tell you if someone's good or 

2513
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:45,350
not,
you,

2514
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:45,350
you don't know if someone's going to.

2515
02:04:45,350 --> 02:04:46,720
Okay.
No more sports questions.

2516
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:53,310
Order it.
I'm going to order that for the time 

2517
02:04:53,310 --> 02:04:55,981
occupied next broadcast.
Hopefully if they get it too many times 

2518
02:04:55,981 --> 02:04:58,030
we will have a tomahawk pipe.
I think that's a fucking awesome item.

2519
02:04:58,031 --> 02:05:03,031
Like you need another pipe.
I needed tom off [inaudible] like a 

2520
02:05:03,031 --> 02:05:06,181
motherfucker I bake,
especially since it's a replica of 

2521
02:05:09,761 --> 02:05:14,020
something from a dude name.
Red Cloud was fanny packs.

2522
02:05:14,021 --> 02:05:14,560
They have.
Oh,

2523
02:05:14,561 --> 02:05:17,710
they have a sweep and we'll get that.
Somebody that quilt.

2524
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:19,000
Oh,
that's like a shoulder bag.

2525
02:05:19,001 --> 02:05:21,100
I don't do shoulder bags.
That's a God damn purse.

2526
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:24,310
Okay.
Fanny pack is fucking manly.

2527
02:05:25,030 --> 02:05:26,680
That's a manly shit.
All right.

2528
02:05:26,681 --> 02:05:29,050
Let's go to the Rogan board and see 
questions.

2529
02:05:29,051 --> 02:05:30,580
Yeah.
Why is fanny pack manly?

2530
02:05:30,700 --> 02:05:32,770
I'll tell you why.
Fanny packs and mainly because if you're

2531
02:05:32,771 --> 02:05:37,771
wearing a fanny pack,
first of all you're saying I don't give 

2532
02:05:37,771 --> 02:05:37,771
a fuck what you think about how I look.

2533
02:05:37,771 --> 02:05:42,300
You know,
you just slapped in this big stupid gay 

2534
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:42,300
thing around your waist and you're like,
whatever.

2535
02:05:42,300 --> 02:05:44,740
I have two hands free and I'm happy.
I'm not trying to look good for you.

2536
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:49,950
I'm not trying to fuck you.
I'm not trying to get you to be my 

2537
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:52,321
friend.
I like having all my shit in a bag then 

2538
02:05:52,321 --> 02:05:53,080
yeah,
I'm not trying to get laid.

2539
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,790
So when people talk about,
oh man hugging,

2540
02:05:54,860 --> 02:05:56,410
you wear it for a pug.
That's so gay.

2541
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,740
It's a bag that connects to my waist.
This is silly.

2542
02:05:59,860 --> 02:06:04,860
The only reason why you don't think it's
good looking because women figures 

2543
02:06:04,860 --> 02:06:07,770
disgusting and women think it looks gay.
So women have figured out a way to 

2544
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:12,630
bully.
Guys did not wearing it by telling us 

2545
02:06:12,630 --> 02:06:12,700
that looks gay.
Why would you care what kind of a bag?

2546
02:06:12,701 --> 02:06:14,610
Another man.
Where's your.

2547
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:18,250
Unless he's wearing a bright pink hello 
kitty strap.

2548
02:06:18,270 --> 02:06:19,620
It covers up your crotch.
Yeah,

2549
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:21,910
it does cover up my crotch.
It's right there.

2550
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:27,150
So if there's like a micro media that 
comes from outer space and could 

2551
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:28,780
potentially hit me in the deck,
it's going to hit my cell phone first or

2552
02:06:28,900 --> 02:06:31,060
perhaps my wallet.
It's right there.

2553
02:06:31,061 --> 02:06:33,460
It's easy for travel.
When I go to the airport,

2554
02:06:33,461 --> 02:06:35,030
I unbuckled that thing,
Bang,

2555
02:06:35,031 --> 02:06:40,031
put it on my car keys on there.
My cell phones now at fanny packs of the

2556
02:06:41,081 --> 02:06:41,890
shit son

2557
02:06:44,160 --> 02:06:45,710
got here.

2558
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:50,880
That would be cool if gay people love 
the smell farts.

2559
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:53,010
That was didn't Joe Joseph

2560
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,480
for awhile.

2561
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:01,440
This fellow says,
when are you going to come to the east 

2562
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:01,440
coast of Canada?
I don't like the east coast.

2563
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:01,440
Can't.
No,

2564
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:04,660
I'm just kidding.
We're in Montreal last April.

2565
02:07:04,840 --> 02:07:07,600
That was fun.
I'll be back.

2566
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:12,760
I'll definitely be back up there.
All right,

2567
02:07:13,030 --> 02:07:18,030
page two.
We're going to the Rogan board right 

2568
02:07:18,030 --> 02:07:18,030
now.
To answer your questions

2569
02:07:18,390 --> 02:07:23,390
thing about Jersey shore.
I don't like Jersey shore watches that 

2570
02:07:23,390 --> 02:07:23,770
thought I would like it because I knew 
too many dudes like that growing up.

2571
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:25,780
To me it's like more annoying and 
stupid.

2572
02:07:26,020 --> 02:07:28,630
It's fun for a couple seconds.
So you fist pump,

2573
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:30,430
you know,
but after awhile it's just,

2574
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:32,620
it's fake.
Did this is my theory.

2575
02:07:32,621 --> 02:07:33,640
I mean talking to my favorite.
No,

2576
02:07:33,780 --> 02:07:36,070
I think it kind of like when Hill's 
first came

2577
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:38,020
out,
everyone thought that was a real.

2578
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:43,140
Then slowly got to the point where we 
figured out it was a fake show that's 

2579
02:07:43,140 --> 02:07:47,911
film to look real.
I think Jersey shores real way too dumb 

2580
02:07:47,911 --> 02:07:51,361
to ask.
Did you know half of them are like male 

2581
02:07:51,361 --> 02:07:53,611
strippers.
I had to audition like they're all in 

2582
02:07:53,611 --> 02:07:55,951
the entertainment field.
It's called Jersey shore and stood the 

2583
02:07:55,951 --> 02:07:55,951
hills.
You know,

2584
02:07:55,951 --> 02:07:58,000
I bet you anything of that.
Yeah,

2585
02:07:58,660 --> 02:08:01,180
I bet you anything sounds and they all 
live in this house.

2586
02:08:01,181 --> 02:08:03,240
It's really nice.
Like railroad house.

2587
02:08:03,450 --> 02:08:06,040
You know what I mean?
That's the real people.

2588
02:08:06,270 --> 02:08:08,230
It's really a genius show if you look at
it that way,

2589
02:08:08,410 --> 02:08:11,650
but I think in three years we're all 
going to be like knowing it's fake.

2590
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:14,940
Like that fight somehow is fake and 
everything really.

2591
02:08:15,150 --> 02:08:17,230
There wasn't fake when I do punch that 
girl to face,

2592
02:08:17,650 --> 02:08:19,430
unless that chick is like a,
you know,

2593
02:08:19,590 --> 02:08:23,440
stump woman and they fucking practice it
for like 50 years.

2594
02:08:23,450 --> 02:08:28,030
You know what I mean?
If they practiced the punch a lot,

2595
02:08:28,031 --> 02:08:28,420
you know?

2596
02:08:29,300 --> 02:08:29,780
Hm.

2597
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:33,260
I mean you look at movies and you look 
at that punch,

2598
02:08:33,261 --> 02:08:35,510
it looks real.
If they filmed it like to look fake,

2599
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:39,270
I think they'll do got drunk and punch 
that bitch face.

2600
02:08:41,350 --> 02:08:43,690
Listen,
someone said what?

2601
02:08:43,691 --> 02:08:48,190
I have full blown aids or spend one year
and Mark Hayden's body pick one.

2602
02:08:49,190 --> 02:08:54,110
Well I know what full blown aids you can
recover from.

2603
02:08:55,100 --> 02:09:00,100
You know,
being in one year and marketing's body 

2604
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:00,100
will probably be torture.
David.

2605
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:01,460
I think full blown aids.
If you take your vitamins,

2606
02:09:01,470 --> 02:09:06,050
probably be okay in a couple of weeks.
You spend one year in mark cadens body.

2607
02:09:06,410 --> 02:09:09,030
Every chicken could possibly fuck,
fuck unaids.

2608
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:11,750
You're not going to get out of these 
bonds and mark cadens body.

2609
02:09:11,930 --> 02:09:15,680
You don't get aids in marketing.
You don't even understand the question.

2610
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,000
No,
I'm saying if you have one year in his 

2611
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:21,000
body,
you could just abuse it.

2612
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:21,380
Like fucking get the fuck out of there 
in one year.

2613
02:09:21,381 --> 02:09:23,240
It's ridiculous.
How dare you.

2614
02:09:24,310 --> 02:09:25,210
That's in this.

2615
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:27,050
Let's end this.
Alright,

2616
02:09:27,080 --> 02:09:28,310
well a couple more questions.
No,

2617
02:09:28,311 --> 02:09:30,440
I need the fuck Outta here.
I got to met.

2618
02:09:30,441 --> 02:09:35,441
Some of these questions are really lame,
but it could be that were really high 

2619
02:09:35,441 --> 02:09:35,720
and they just seem lane.

2620
02:09:37,750 --> 02:09:41,220
That's a distinct possibility,
which that's more coffee right now.

2621
02:09:43,770 --> 02:09:44,160
Um,

2622
02:09:46,050 --> 02:09:49,230
I apologize for the wack ass Internet.
I really am going to fix that.

2623
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,020
Should I go 80 and t uverse or should I 
go?

2624
02:09:52,021 --> 02:09:53,670
Comcast cable.
Charter.

2625
02:09:53,820 --> 02:09:54,960
Charter,
Charter.

2626
02:09:58,380 --> 02:09:59,550
Wow.
This guy says,

2627
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:01,650
I think red bands.
Life is fake.

2628
02:10:01,680 --> 02:10:04,730
How about that for our children to camp 
mistake.

2629
02:10:04,770 --> 02:10:05,910
He says,
your life is fake.

2630
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:08,430
I think you said your face is fake in 
his face.

2631
02:10:08,431 --> 02:10:12,300
His screen names fake.
Like he didn't even have a picture.

2632
02:10:14,930 --> 02:10:17,390
This is di.
What would happen?

2633
02:10:17,450 --> 02:10:19,450
Well,
it's fake and on.

2634
02:10:19,950 --> 02:10:20,880
It was not fun.

2635
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:21,930
Nope.

2636
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:25,590
With this,
this is the laziest rapist ever.

2637
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:28,260
Dave Broomfield@hotmail.com
says,

2638
02:10:28,470 --> 02:10:29,580
hey,
Joe Rogan.

2639
02:10:29,581 --> 02:10:32,910
Why don't you invite me to come trip 
with you and your isolation tank.

2640
02:10:33,610 --> 02:10:36,440
How lazy is he?
That's not how you were stalking rape.

2641
02:10:36,441 --> 02:10:38,570
Somebody saw him.
It's gonna.

2642
02:10:38,810 --> 02:10:39,590
Take.
It's gonna.

2643
02:10:39,591 --> 02:10:41,090
You gonna have to be a little more 
clever than that.

2644
02:10:41,630 --> 02:10:42,530
That's ridiculous.

2645
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:45,440
Fuck that guy.

2646
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:50,920
We've got a fake Brett Rogers.
Hey Joe Robbie.

2647
02:10:50,930 --> 02:10:54,100
Did you see my last fight?
No.

2648
02:10:54,101 --> 02:10:55,770
Fake Brett Rogers.
I didn't.

2649
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:03,490
For Roger's not on twitter.
Isn't gentlemen that's a fake Brett 

2650
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:06,760
Rogers.
The railroad rogers is a bad 

2651
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:06,760
motherfucker,
but that's not him.

2652
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:11,240
But it was really funny when the fake 
Brett Rogers was having an argument with

2653
02:11:11,241 --> 02:11:14,820
a real,
a warm machine that was pretty funny.

2654
02:11:16,010 --> 02:11:18,720
War machine didn't get it.
Thought it was all really happening.

2655
02:11:21,390 --> 02:11:22,750
Brian,
you stopped talking a while ago.

2656
02:11:22,780 --> 02:11:24,060
What happened if you've given up on us?

2657
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:29,340
Yeah.
I get to the cutoff point where I'm just

2658
02:11:29,341 --> 02:11:31,260
tired of staring at computer.

2659
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:35,810
Well,
I have an accompany in Indian head dress

2660
02:11:35,811 --> 02:11:38,650
to go with my Tomahawk pipe.
Says uh,

2661
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:41,410
um,
use 97.

2662
02:11:41,630 --> 02:11:42,620
90 four.
Yeah,

2663
02:11:42,621 --> 02:11:45,680
that's a very good question.
And I think yes,

2664
02:11:45,681 --> 02:11:48,590
I think if we're gonna really get in 
touch with the spirit world.

2665
02:11:48,770 --> 02:11:51,230
We're going to need full Indian attire.
Anything.

2666
02:11:51,980 --> 02:11:53,150
Yeah.
We're going to need the whole thing,

2667
02:11:53,151 --> 02:11:55,490
man.
We're going to need feathers and shit.

2668
02:11:55,491 --> 02:11:57,080
And the,
you know,

2669
02:11:57,170 --> 02:12:02,170
the correct type of.
We'd kind of make sure we only smoke 

2670
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:02,170
what the Indian.
Small?

2671
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:02,170
Yeah.

2672
02:12:02,170 --> 02:12:02,870
Smaller condoms.
Small.

2673
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:04,190
No,
not those Indians.

2674
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:06,930
American Indians.
That India Indians.

2675
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:10,110
Girl Mosh pit.
I watched her for a couple of seconds,

2676
02:12:10,111 --> 02:12:15,111
but it was like one of those terrorists 
videos where they cut some dude's head 

2677
02:12:15,111 --> 02:12:15,111
off after awhile.
I just shut it off.

2678
02:12:19,240 --> 02:12:21,230
She,
if any of these questions don't suck.

2679
02:12:23,890 --> 02:12:28,640
So,
um,

2680
02:12:29,090 --> 02:12:31,910
I think if anything came out of this 
somewhere,

2681
02:12:31,911 --> 02:12:36,911
someone right now is thinking about 
designing a robot where you clone your 

2682
02:12:37,251 --> 02:12:40,000
neighbor and make a robot out of it and 
then fuck them and rape them in front of

2683
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:42,980
somebody.
Somebody is thinking about that.

2684
02:12:42,981 --> 02:12:45,260
And I think if this

2685
02:12:45,430 --> 02:12:47,560
chat has done anything good for the 
world,

2686
02:12:47,590 --> 02:12:52,590
it's introduced that idea at that 
possibility out there of making a clone 

2687
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:53,790
of you.
You're just gonna sack is we're going to

2688
02:12:53,791 --> 02:12:57,040
be like 90 years old and they're going 
to make the perfect fuck robot,

2689
02:12:57,280 --> 02:12:59,430
but we're going to be so old.
We're not going to even care anymore.

2690
02:13:01,510 --> 02:13:05,810
I'm telling you that it was.
Yeah,

2691
02:13:06,940 --> 02:13:11,940
I guess,
but they'll probably have more problems 

2692
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:11,940
than we have now.
You know,

2693
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:12,840
we'll probably look back on these days 
and Oh,

2694
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:17,880
remember the simple times they just get 
on the Internet and drive to work and 

2695
02:13:17,880 --> 02:13:20,911
you have to worry about monsters and 
aliens and Ufo and fucking know the 

2696
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:23,560
Hyena flu.
That's killing everybody lately.

2697
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:25,530
You know,
that's the next one.

2698
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:27,470
Something scary like pig food doesn't 
scare you.

2699
02:13:27,510 --> 02:13:29,540
Bird flu.
That doesn't scare the fucking Hyena.

2700
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:32,010
Flu is going to scare the shit out of,
you know,

2701
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:34,890
it's a flu that came from hyenas.
Holy Shit.

2702
02:13:35,190 --> 02:13:35,790
Yeah.
From,

2703
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:40,820
from eating their own young.
They came up with a fucking crazy new 

2704
02:13:40,820 --> 02:13:44,391
flu and it's an everyone who gets it 
dies everywhere.

2705
02:13:45,080 --> 02:13:47,000
What beekeepers outfits everywhere.

2706
02:13:48,280 --> 02:13:51,680
Cat in California last week got the 
first h,

2707
02:13:51,681 --> 02:13:54,760
one n,
one reeling people that cat.

2708
02:13:54,950 --> 02:13:57,140
Uh,
so maybe it's going to be cats.

2709
02:13:57,141 --> 02:13:59,120
We're gonna have to kill our cats or 
something like that.

2710
02:13:59,300 --> 02:14:02,060
After you have a baby,
cats become just really annoying.

2711
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:04,250
Dogs are knowing,
like shut the fuck up.

2712
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:05,430
But he was the best

2713
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:09,200
babies.
Rural dogs or cats.

2714
02:14:09,410 --> 02:14:12,360
My cats started pissing in my office 
right after my child was born.

2715
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:14,430
New plans.
Parent little con.

2716
02:14:15,090 --> 02:14:18,090
So obvious what you wanted to be a 
little bitch.

2717
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:24,280
A couple more questions here.
Let's go to the rug and boards if we've 

2718
02:14:24,280 --> 02:14:25,230
got a good question there.
Do you ever get mad?

2719
02:14:25,231 --> 02:14:30,231
Like in anything?
Actually pushed her off to the point 

2720
02:14:30,231 --> 02:14:30,270
where urban smash a,
I get that I get upset,

2721
02:14:30,580 --> 02:14:33,410
but it has to be pretty fucking a bad 
situation.

2722
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:38,510
Me that upset.
I'm pretty rational when it comes to 

2723
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:38,510
most things.
I have A.

2724
02:14:38,510 --> 02:14:40,910
I mean everyone has the ability to freak
out over something.

2725
02:14:40,911 --> 02:14:43,280
It's just whether or not you choose to 
let yourself get there.

2726
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:45,080
You know,
just gotTa.

2727
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:50,260
Make sure.
I think the most important thing about 

2728
02:14:50,260 --> 02:14:52,571
not getting mad as manage your biology,
you got to treat your biology like it's 

2729
02:14:52,571 --> 02:14:52,700
a bank account.
And if you have,

2730
02:14:52,750 --> 02:14:54,170
you know,
if you're in debt,

2731
02:14:54,370 --> 02:14:57,920
you know you owe it something.
If you know your overdrafted you,

2732
02:14:57,930 --> 02:15:00,770
you owe yourself an expenditure of 
energy.

2733
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,510
Yeah.
Especially if you have a certain type of

2734
02:15:02,511 --> 02:15:04,790
body.
If you have a muscular body,

2735
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:07,550
if you have a person is in engaged in 
athletics or whole life,

2736
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:10,520
you have a Bot.
If it's used to exerting a lot of energy

2737
02:15:10,521 --> 02:15:15,521
when you owe it to that body,
you have to like you have a debt to pay 

2738
02:15:15,521 --> 02:15:16,430
and if you don't pay that debt,
you're gonna,

2739
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:21,460
you're gonna have a problem where you're
going to have too much energy that's 

2740
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:23,060
stored up and built in,
not blown out and it's going to come out

2741
02:15:23,120 --> 02:15:24,350
and unusual ways.

2742
02:15:24,350 --> 02:15:27,750
Look in traffic or at work or whatever.
It'll you'll,

2743
02:15:27,751 --> 02:15:30,890
you'll start screaming and freaking out 
about something he really didn't need to

2744
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:34,190
and really it's all just about managing 
your biology,

2745
02:15:34,430 --> 02:15:39,430
managing your thoughts.
It's very important to have some 

2746
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:40,550
downtime where you can sit alone by 
yourself and just think,

2747
02:15:40,790 --> 02:15:42,650
that's very,
very important for me.

2748
02:15:43,010 --> 02:15:45,620
The isolation tank does that,
like times 100,

2749
02:15:45,621 --> 02:15:50,621
that's my favorite,
but sometimes even just sitting on the 

2750
02:15:50,621 --> 02:15:50,621
couch and just by myself,
just thinking,

2751
02:15:50,720 --> 02:15:52,340
you know,
you can call it meditation,

2752
02:15:52,370 --> 02:15:54,050
you can call it whatever the fuck you 
want.

2753
02:15:54,051 --> 02:15:59,051
Just spending time to organize your 
thoughts and put your mind in a certain 

2754
02:15:59,051 --> 02:16:03,071
place.
Put your body in a certain place with 

2755
02:16:03,071 --> 02:16:03,071
exercise,
with yoga,

2756
02:16:03,071 --> 02:16:04,430
with nutrition,
all that Shit's important.

2757
02:16:04,480 --> 02:16:07,640
You've got to manage your biology and 
when you manage your biology,

2758
02:16:07,641 --> 02:16:09,830
it makes managing your mind much,
much easier.

2759
02:16:10,250 --> 02:16:12,290
Managing your mind,
managing a biology.

2760
02:16:12,291 --> 02:16:14,030
That's the key to not getting upset at 
things.

2761
02:16:15,440 --> 02:16:20,440
You fucking faggots.
What the best artists created from the 

2762
02:16:20,440 --> 02:16:22,850
starving artist.
It seems that this is a good question.

2763
02:16:22,990 --> 02:16:26,420
It seems the best art is created from 
the starving artists being wealthy.

2764
02:16:26,421 --> 02:16:29,320
Do you feel it hurts your ability to 
create art comedy,

2765
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:34,350
or do you believe that not having to 
worry about your financial wellbeing 

2766
02:16:34,350 --> 02:16:37,120
allows you more time to be creative?
That's a very good question.

2767
02:16:37,390 --> 02:16:41,260
I think a lot of times people are much 
more ambitious when they're starving.

2768
02:16:41,261 --> 02:16:44,860
They have much more energy.
They have much more a dedication towards

2769
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:49,861
something,
but that doesn't mean that you can't 

2770
02:16:49,861 --> 02:16:49,861
have a lot of dedication towards 
something when you become successful.

2771
02:16:50,140 --> 02:16:52,630
It all depends on what was your 
motivation in the first place.

2772
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:56,410
If your motivation in the first place 
was recognition and you know,

2773
02:16:56,411 --> 02:16:59,830
adulation and then you become famous and
then you get that,

2774
02:16:59,831 --> 02:17:01,780
then you have no motivation to keep 
going,

2775
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:06,130
but if your motivation is the actual art
itself is creating new things,

2776
02:17:06,310 --> 02:17:11,310
then I think you can be more free as you
become successful because you're in a 

2777
02:17:11,310 --> 02:17:12,670
position where you don't have to worry 
about money anymore,

2778
02:17:12,671 --> 02:17:17,671
so you have one less thing to think 
about and you're ambitious in the sense 

2779
02:17:17,671 --> 02:17:18,750
of being creative instead of 
concentrating on money.

2780
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:22,210
Your mind is not geared on that.
Your mind is weird on the art.

2781
02:17:22,570 --> 02:17:25,510
That's how I like to think that I am and
when I'm at my best,

2782
02:17:25,540 --> 02:17:28,360
that is where I'm at.
That's my mind frame.

2783
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:33,630
You know?
That's my my point of references that I 

2784
02:17:33,630 --> 02:17:34,150
think about the,
the creation of the art itself.

2785
02:17:34,330 --> 02:17:36,880
That's when I'm at my best.
If I think about money,

2786
02:17:36,881 --> 02:17:39,940
I think about like how much is this 
going to pay me and is this worth this?

2787
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:42,590
It's not the same motivation,
so it's.

2788
02:17:42,790 --> 02:17:45,460
You don't get the same results.
It's not the same passion to it,

2789
02:17:45,461 --> 02:17:50,461
but the passion has got to be real.
It's gotta be my comedy the way in my 

2790
02:17:50,461 --> 02:17:54,241
head,
my motivation is all about whether or 

2791
02:17:54,241 --> 02:17:56,401
not people enjoy it.
I don't want to do anything that people 

2792
02:17:56,401 --> 02:17:56,401
don't enjoy.
I want to make sure that everything that

2793
02:17:56,401 --> 02:18:01,021
I'm creating,
I'm creating it so other people get 

2794
02:18:01,021 --> 02:18:01,050
enjoyment out of it and that's the 
reward that you get for that one.

2795
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:02,950
Yeah,
as long as you're concentrating on that,

2796
02:18:03,160 --> 02:18:08,160
you do no wrong.
As long as you have the dynamic in the 

2797
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:08,160
relationship between you and the 
audience,

2798
02:18:08,170 --> 02:18:13,170
as long as you respect that,
and as long as your relationship to the 

2799
02:18:13,170 --> 02:18:14,530
creativity is all based on just 
producing more stuff,

2800
02:18:14,531 --> 02:18:17,710
that's good that people enjoy as long as
you're doing it for that reason,

2801
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:19,750
I don't think you have to worry about,
you know,

2802
02:18:19,751 --> 02:18:24,751
money robbing you of your enthusiasm,
but if you were just in it for the money

2803
02:18:24,971 --> 02:18:27,010
and just in it for the adulation,
yeah,

2804
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:28,930
you become successful and then all of a 
sudden like,

2805
02:18:28,931 --> 02:18:31,660
you're not gonna wanna do it anymore.
You're not going to be.

2806
02:18:31,661 --> 02:18:34,450
You're not going to be enthusiastic 
about it anymore.

2807
02:18:40,310 --> 02:18:44,340
Hyena flew equal super aids.
That's what I'm talking about.

2808
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:49,060
We're planning on doing December 20,
first 2012.

2809
02:18:49,580 --> 02:18:50,710
Um,
no.

2810
02:18:50,711 --> 02:18:53,700
I'm going to stay.
If it's really what people's.

2811
02:18:53,720 --> 02:18:55,090
Are you going to go to the pyramids,
man?

2812
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:58,510
If it's really what some people think it
is,

2813
02:18:58,511 --> 02:19:01,030
this convergence is technological 
convergence.

2814
02:19:01,031 --> 02:19:06,031
We're all human beings will interface 
with each other where someone creates a 

2815
02:19:06,031 --> 02:19:07,990
time machine where some huge 
technological breakthrough happens.

2816
02:19:07,991 --> 02:19:09,610
If that's,
that's what some people think.

2817
02:19:09,611 --> 02:19:14,611
December 20,
first 2012 or whatever that shit's 

2818
02:19:14,611 --> 02:19:14,780
called Hadron collider and that's about 
the time it's gonna.

2819
02:19:15,330 --> 02:19:17,380
If that's the case,
then it doesn't matter where you are.

2820
02:19:17,381 --> 02:19:19,690
Right?
And they should be amongst friends.

2821
02:19:19,691 --> 02:19:24,691
Could done nearby.
Maybe Brian and I will do a ustream 

2822
02:19:24,691 --> 02:19:24,691
that,
but yeah.

2823
02:19:24,691 --> 02:19:25,210
Should we commit to a 24 hour?
Let's commit to.

2824
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:30,720
Right now.
We're going to commit to a huge dream 

2825
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:30,720
for December,
December

2826
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:30,720
20,
first 2012,

2827
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:34,420
December 20th,
2012 commit so that as the 21st turns 

2828
02:19:34,420 --> 02:19:34,610
over,
we'll do it at midnight.

2829
02:19:34,611 --> 02:19:37,010
Show at night.
We will start at 8:00

2830
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,660
eastern,
so that's 11:00

2831
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:40,730
eastern.
I don't care what time it is in England.

2832
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:41,900
You don't count.
Okay.

2833
02:19:41,901 --> 02:19:43,640
That's not December 20.
First 2012.

2834
02:19:43,641 --> 02:19:45,590
It's all based on fucking America.
Okay.

2835
02:19:45,830 --> 02:19:49,010
Because the Mayans and the Americans 
were basically on the same calendar sort

2836
02:19:49,011 --> 02:19:50,960
of right now.
Kind of really.

2837
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:56,180
I think a different timeline resource in
teaching eatsa is the same as Miami.

2838
02:19:56,210 --> 02:19:57,830
Okay.
It's just a little bit below that.

2839
02:19:58,250 --> 02:20:00,860
I'm either way,
December 20th,

2840
02:20:01,070 --> 02:20:03,380
2012,
2012.

2841
02:20:03,530 --> 02:20:05,690
Brian and I are committing right now to 
a use dream.

2842
02:20:05,691 --> 02:20:06,230
We're going to do it.

2843
02:20:07,890 --> 02:20:10,080
Feel strong about that.
Nothing's going to happen.

2844
02:20:10,910 --> 02:20:11,700
Maybe.
Maybe not.

2845
02:20:11,701 --> 02:20:13,530
It's going to happen.
That is a possibility.

2846
02:20:13,860 --> 02:20:18,860
You know,
I think people let them know that 

2847
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:20,511
something's going to happen.
We have a friend that likes to believe 

2848
02:20:20,511 --> 02:20:23,271
in Ufos and psychics and con chem trails
and anything,

2849
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:25,470
anything wacky.
This,

2850
02:20:25,471 --> 02:20:27,900
this dude is just jumps on board.
You know,

2851
02:20:27,930 --> 02:20:32,930
and I think it's just as possible that 
nothing's going to happen as more 

2852
02:20:34,410 --> 02:20:37,210
possible.
It is possible to.

2853
02:20:37,211 --> 02:20:39,480
Something might happen on the day 
because everybody's thinking something's

2854
02:20:39,481 --> 02:20:40,630
going to happen on that day,
right.

2855
02:20:40,690 --> 02:20:45,690
If it's some dude sitting somewhere with
some bombs that made me think that I 

2856
02:20:45,690 --> 02:20:46,000
think,
you know,

2857
02:20:46,050 --> 02:20:51,050
the idea that we're going to force 
something to happen by really 

2858
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:51,050
concentrating it as,
you know,

2859
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:53,550
as a point of focus.
This one point.

2860
02:20:53,790 --> 02:20:58,790
Yeah.
But that's what everyone thought was 

2861
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:58,790
going to happen in 2000.
That is true.

2862
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:59,130
But everybody was waiting for the clocks
to break in.

2863
02:20:59,131 --> 02:21:04,131
2,000
was a very specific things falling from 

2864
02:21:04,131 --> 02:21:04,131
the sky.
Stop working,

2865
02:21:04,131 --> 02:21:05,430
man.
I stayed home.

2866
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:07,530
I remember I stayed home.
That was one of the first,

2867
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:12,620
um,
first years where I didn't do a new 

2868
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:12,620
year's show.
All right.

2869
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:13,950
I think I probably was worried.

2870
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:17,990
It's so weird is that everyone was 
really freaked out about that.

2871
02:21:18,050 --> 02:21:22,100
And then we had all this built up stress
because of it.

2872
02:21:22,101 --> 02:21:25,250
And then just shortly after nine slash 
11,

2873
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:27,230
it's like,
then we finally got the release,

2874
02:21:27,231 --> 02:21:28,600
all the stress,
like the world's ending.

2875
02:21:30,860 --> 02:21:35,860
I just remember being really stressed 
out thinking something was going to 

2876
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:37,010
happen.
It seems like right after 9:11.

2877
02:21:37,790 --> 02:21:38,650
Alright,
let's quit.

2878
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:43,450
Dr Brain's most easily give up.
Brian doesn't.

2879
02:21:44,430 --> 02:21:46,270
It doesn't take vitamins.
Yeah.

2880
02:21:46,290 --> 02:21:47,770
Two hours.
Two hours and 20 minutes.

2881
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:51,610
I ate a bag of carrots today.
I have a juicer now.

2882
02:21:51,611 --> 02:21:52,150
Oh Man.

2883
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:57,640
Well we've dropped down to 425 years.
But that says to me is at least 100 

2884
02:21:57,640 --> 02:21:58,880
motherfuckers thought we were boring as 
shit.

2885
02:21:58,990 --> 02:22:03,200
Yeah.
So I think that how Harry is my.

2886
02:22:03,201 --> 02:22:05,600
But from one to 10,
how dare you sir.

2887
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:08,810
How dare you.
Big Too to thug.

2888
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:12,200
Um,
from one to 10 my but three,

2889
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:15,200
three or four.
I really could use shaving and trimming.

2890
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:20,500
I was listening to an old Howard stern 
broadcasts where they were fined and he 

2891
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:22,670
was fine for talking about shaving is,
but you know,

2892
02:22:22,671 --> 02:22:27,671
you don't realize how crazy those 
fucking regular radio shows are like 

2893
02:22:27,671 --> 02:22:27,960
what you can and can't do until you hear
something like that.

2894
02:22:27,961 --> 02:22:30,600
But it was inspiring and I was thinking 
about Truman,

2895
02:22:30,601 --> 02:22:32,870
my own bonaire.
But uh,

2896
02:22:32,940 --> 02:22:33,780
it could definitely help.

2897
02:22:37,850 --> 02:22:41,900
Solar flares are not in our control.
And that's the thing to worry about,

2898
02:22:41,901 --> 02:22:46,901
says wrapped or 94,
wrapped in 94 things that solar flares 

2899
02:22:46,901 --> 02:22:48,110
are you going to do us in for possible?
Man,

2900
02:22:48,530 --> 02:22:53,530
nobody fucking gay.
Make Brian cleaned my room for the next 

2901
02:22:53,530 --> 02:22:53,530
year.
Stream.

2902
02:22:53,530 --> 02:22:55,780
That's just my other desk is covered the
shit I,

2903
02:22:55,920 --> 02:23:00,920
it's a desk,
but I really use it as a place to just 

2904
02:23:00,920 --> 02:23:03,731
leave shit.
I'm a slob and have problems as 

2905
02:23:03,731 --> 02:23:04,770
adrenaline.
Du Du,

2906
02:23:04,771 --> 02:23:05,120
Du,
Du,

2907
02:23:05,121 --> 02:23:10,121
du Du.
What bullshit resolutions will you say 

2908
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:14,270
you will keep and won't know?
I don't make resolutions.

2909
02:23:14,460 --> 02:23:16,600
She's not a girl because I'm not a 
fucking girl.

2910
02:23:17,090 --> 02:23:18,600
All right.
And uh,

2911
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:20,230
if I wanted to fix something about 
myself,

2912
02:23:20,231 --> 02:23:20,700
I would start.

2913
02:23:20,720 --> 02:23:22,220
No,
I wouldn't wait.

2914
02:23:22,670 --> 02:23:24,920
I always say I'm going to work out more 
this year.

2915
02:23:24,921 --> 02:23:26,150
I'm going to talk,
I'll get my shit together.

2916
02:23:26,390 --> 02:23:29,900
But for the most part I put out as much 
energy as I want to put out.

2917
02:23:30,080 --> 02:23:35,080
I focus on things as much,
as much as I can while still enjoying 

2918
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:35,080
them,
you know,

2919
02:23:35,660 --> 02:23:38,690
always dancing around obsession.
That's very important to me.

2920
02:23:38,691 --> 02:23:40,190
Whether it's with comedy or anything 
else.

2921
02:23:40,220 --> 02:23:42,140
And with games,
with anything in my life,

2922
02:23:42,141 --> 02:23:44,240
I always have to dance around becoming 
obsessed with things.

2923
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:49,690
So for me it's just just enjoy,
just try to be balanced and try to 

2924
02:23:50,031 --> 02:23:51,770
consciously,
you know,

2925
02:23:51,980 --> 02:23:56,980
just try to have a good time to be 
positive when I get obsessed with 

2926
02:23:56,980 --> 02:24:00,161
things,
whether it's about Jujitsu or comedy or 

2927
02:24:00,161 --> 02:24:03,640
playing games like pool or video games,
I get crazy about things and I don't 

2928
02:24:04,580 --> 02:24:06,680
like that feeling.
I don't get obsessed with things.

2929
02:24:07,170 --> 02:24:08,730
Brian,
you get obsessed with jerking off that?

2930
02:24:09,020 --> 02:24:10,080
No.
Hey,

2931
02:24:10,150 --> 02:24:12,680
due to how much porn do you have?

2932
02:24:12,850 --> 02:24:17,850
I get obsessed with Internet now for 
sure was like I constantly want more 

2933
02:24:17,850 --> 02:24:22,651
information about everything and it just
branches off more and more and more and 

2934
02:24:22,651 --> 02:24:23,980
make.
I'll be looking at that why,

2935
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:25,690
what,
how applesauce is made,

2936
02:24:25,691 --> 02:24:27,730
but then I need to know about how the 
apples are grown,

2937
02:24:27,731 --> 02:24:32,731
you know,
and just keeps on going and going and 

2938
02:24:32,731 --> 02:24:32,731
going.
Yeah.

2939
02:24:32,731 --> 02:24:33,220
It wasn't that way when you were a kid,
right?

2940
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:34,240
No,
not at all.

2941
02:24:34,450 --> 02:24:37,060
I fucking hated reading and I didn't 
want to learn anything.

2942
02:24:37,061 --> 02:24:39,650
I just wanted to play video games and 
around on the grass.

2943
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:42,670
Funny how different when you get older,
your your id

2944
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:45,170
idea of information changes.
Because when I was a kid,

2945
02:24:45,171 --> 02:24:48,440
information always med school and Shit,
you have to learn meant boring.

2946
02:24:48,441 --> 02:24:49,790
Meant suck.
Right now.

2947
02:24:49,791 --> 02:24:54,791
They were all connected together,
but then when it's no longer a 

2948
02:24:54,791 --> 02:24:54,791
requirement,
then yeah,

2949
02:24:54,791 --> 02:24:59,280
you'd be,
you find out what you're actually 

2950
02:24:59,280 --> 02:24:59,280
interested in.
You pursue those things.

2951
02:25:01,790 --> 02:25:03,630
No,
no,

2952
02:25:07,700 --> 02:25:11,930
probably just fucking fall asleep on me.
Believe that shit the fuck.

2953
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:13,610
Alright.
My twitter friends.

2954
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:16,640
I think uh,
we're going to answer one more question.

2955
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:23,000
He's fake snoring like the goddamn three
stooges stuff.

2956
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:23,950
Is that mo?

2957
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:28,330
Are you doing mo?
We got to know her way.

2958
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:30,300
It might've been curling maybe,
right?

2959
02:25:34,390 --> 02:25:35,740
Uh,

2960
02:25:38,330 --> 02:25:40,320
2000,
2012.

2961
02:25:40,321 --> 02:25:43,620
Something very subtle may happen that we
don't realize for awhile.

2962
02:25:44,510 --> 02:25:47,580
Good Dude.
Dude,

2963
02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:52,540
go smoke your aol discs and get off the 
internet.

2964
02:25:56,260 --> 02:25:57,850
Something subtle is happening right now.

2965
02:25:58,030 --> 02:26:00,480
Recognized for awhile.
That's not what 2012 sources be.

2966
02:26:00,520 --> 02:26:03,550
If that's what happens,
then 2012 was bullshit.

2967
02:26:04,180 --> 02:26:05,600
One hundred percent bullshit.
If the,

2968
02:26:05,630 --> 02:26:09,250
if December 20,
first 2012 rolls around and we just go,

2969
02:26:10,180 --> 02:26:11,290
nothing,
I don't feel anything,

2970
02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:13,120
I don't feel a thing,
then it's bullshit.

2971
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:14,500
One hundred percent.
It's not like,

2972
02:26:14,590 --> 02:26:15,110
Oh man,
no,

2973
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:20,130
there's a change.
You just not going to realize it for 

2974
02:26:20,130 --> 02:26:20,130
awhile.
No,

2975
02:26:20,130 --> 02:26:22,600
it's supposed to be Bam.
It's supposed to be open a door.

2976
02:26:22,660 --> 02:26:24,250
Here's a new thing.
You know,

2977
02:26:24,310 --> 02:26:29,310
I mean if the Internet turned on,
like if there was a day that the 

2978
02:26:29,310 --> 02:26:30,350
internet turned on,
we all look back and say,

2979
02:26:30,370 --> 02:26:31,960
Whoa,
December 10th,

2980
02:26:31,961 --> 02:26:36,961
2019 93.
That's when the Internet turned on in 

2981
02:26:36,961 --> 02:26:38,800
the world changed forever.
If there was like a recognized date,

2982
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:43,980
first of all,
that would be way more important than 

2983
02:26:43,980 --> 02:26:43,980
fucking Columbus Day.
How about that?

2984
02:26:43,980 --> 02:26:45,580
How about we studied Columbus Day and 
that dude never even landed in America,

2985
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:50,610
right?
Who was in the Bahamas or raping and 

2986
02:26:50,610 --> 02:26:50,610
murdering people and Shit.
You know,

2987
02:26:50,610 --> 02:26:53,650
and then Columbus Day,
the Internet day is a way bigger day for

2988
02:26:53,651 --> 02:26:55,600
American history than fucking Columbus 
Day.

2989
02:26:55,870 --> 02:26:59,530
If they came out with an Internet day,
that would be important.

2990
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:00,190
But

2991
02:27:01,290 --> 02:27:06,290
December 20,
first 2012 has to be like that Internet 

2992
02:27:06,290 --> 02:27:06,290
day.
It has to be David.

2993
02:27:06,290 --> 02:27:06,750
We look back and go,
wow,

2994
02:27:06,900 --> 02:27:11,340
that day some shit started off.
That's the day that changed everything.

2995
02:27:11,370 --> 02:27:12,240
That's what,
December 20,

2996
02:27:12,241 --> 02:27:14,680
first 2012.
It's got to be the,

2997
02:27:14,681 --> 02:27:16,660
all the hype behind it.
If it's not that,

2998
02:27:16,661 --> 02:27:18,000
then it's bullshit,
you know,

2999
02:27:18,001 --> 02:27:19,720
this whole idea that it's the end of an 
age.

3000
02:27:19,721 --> 02:27:21,810
So it's becoming a,
a new era.

3001
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:22,590
Maybe,
maybe,

3002
02:27:22,591 --> 02:27:27,591
possibly.
But to me that could just as easily 

3003
02:27:27,591 --> 02:27:30,711
happen tomorrow or being.
Why do we assume that the Mayans were 

3004
02:27:30,711 --> 02:27:32,130
absolutely correct about that?
Even if they were correcting,

3005
02:27:32,131 --> 02:27:35,490
recognizing that human beings go in 
cycles,

3006
02:27:35,491 --> 02:27:36,080
you know,
that's uh,

3007
02:27:36,081 --> 02:27:36,690
that's not,
uh,

3008
02:27:36,691 --> 02:27:40,140
an an old idea that you guys is a um,
uh,

3009
02:27:40,220 --> 02:27:45,220
and I believe Hindu idea.
I think it's Hindu or along the same 

3010
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:49,101
lines that there's,
there's like stages that humanity goes 

3011
02:27:49,101 --> 02:27:52,881
for,
goes through and that these stages of 

3012
02:27:52,881 --> 02:27:52,881
these cycles,
that they're all repeatable,

3013
02:27:52,881 --> 02:27:53,520
they just keep happening.

3014
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:56,190
I can a cycle over and over again,
just like how you breathe in,

3015
02:27:56,191 --> 02:27:58,800
you breathe out,
humanity rises and falls.

3016
02:27:59,250 --> 02:28:02,360
And right now we're supposed to be in 
Kali Yoga and this.

3017
02:28:02,400 --> 02:28:07,400
It's also supposed to end the same time 
around where the Mayans believe that 

3018
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:11,871
this,
this age is going to end and the same 

3019
02:28:11,871 --> 02:28:11,990
time we're terence Mckenna's,
you know,

3020
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:15,240
timewave zero novelty theory,
which a lot of people think is bullshit.

3021
02:28:15,241 --> 02:28:20,241
I don't know if it's bullshit or not,
but there was a guy named terrence 

3022
02:28:20,241 --> 02:28:22,910
Mckenna that had this crazy mathematical
algorithm designed track time and it was

3023
02:28:22,911 --> 02:28:27,911
based off the teaching.
And the idea was that you could apply 

3024
02:28:27,911 --> 02:28:28,970
this to past events and show that all 
human innovation,

3025
02:28:29,180 --> 02:28:34,180
that progress in humanity is all like 
you could chart it on a graph that it's 

3026
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:37,910
all like going along a certain direction
and that eventually was going to reach a

3027
02:28:37,911 --> 02:28:40,100
point of what he called ultimate 
novelty.

3028
02:28:40,280 --> 02:28:44,960
And the idea of ultimate novelty would 
be something that we would figure out or

3029
02:28:44,961 --> 02:28:47,180
do like create a time machine or 
something like that.

3030
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:50,570
That would literally change everything 
as we know it.

3031
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:55,840
You know?
And that Ray Kurtzweil calls it the 

3032
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:58,451
singularity.
You know that there's a bunch of 

3033
02:28:58,451 --> 02:29:00,050
different scientists that believe we're 
moving towards this convergence,

3034
02:29:00,051 --> 02:29:05,051
this one big invention,
and they tie that into the mind thing 

3035
02:29:05,051 --> 02:29:09,161
that December 20,
first 2012 is exactly the same as the 

3036
02:29:09,161 --> 02:29:11,300
ending point for ultimate novelty for 
timewave zero,

3037
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:14,390
and that Terence Mckenna arrived at that
time.

3038
02:29:14,540 --> 02:29:16,280
Completely independent of the Mayan 
calendar.

3039
02:29:16,310 --> 02:29:19,010
I don't know if it's bullshit.
You don't have really studied at either.

3040
02:29:19,011 --> 02:29:19,190
Right?

3041
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:24,220
Did he tell you about this whole thing 
and he just programmed this logic around

3042
02:29:24,221 --> 02:29:24,610
that date?

3043
02:29:24,720 --> 02:29:26,550
It's possible.
It's possible.

3044
02:29:26,580 --> 02:29:28,140
It didn't seem like he was a liar 
though.

3045
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:29,580
I mean,
he might've been kind of a hippie

3046
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:31,360
and they're.
They're all lies.

3047
02:29:31,361 --> 02:29:33,430
They all want the money so they could 
buy weed,

3048
02:29:34,220 --> 02:29:39,040
fucking patrolling.
Maybe we don't know if it was a.

3049
02:29:39,170 --> 02:29:44,170
What we do know is this fucking thing 
has been going on for two hours and 30 

3050
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:44,960
minutes and that's it.
It's over.

3051
02:29:44,961 --> 02:29:49,961
Religious Gentleman.
Brian and I are going to get something 

3052
02:29:49,961 --> 02:29:50,120
to eat and we're going to sign out.
We're going to try to do this every week

3053
02:29:50,121 --> 02:29:50,480
now.

3054
02:29:51,160 --> 02:29:52,050
Two hours every week.

3055
02:29:52,270 --> 02:29:53,580
Two hours,
two hours and a half,

3056
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:55,480
right?
Two hours is not so good,

3057
02:29:55,690 --> 02:29:57,460
but,
or two hours in the half is not so good.

3058
02:29:57,461 --> 02:29:59,500
Two hours to perfect by now.
But uh,

3059
02:29:59,501 --> 02:30:01,960
we appreciate all 400 and fucking 
whatever.

3060
02:30:01,961 --> 02:30:04,180
Have you.
We had 500 people at one point in time.

3061
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,540
It's like a comedy club and as soon as 
we,

3062
02:30:06,630 --> 02:30:08,500
uh,
it gets more Internet in here,

3063
02:30:08,550 --> 02:30:12,120
we're going to start triple broadcasting
it on both Justin TV

3064
02:30:12,390 --> 02:30:13,500
and all the other ones.
I will,

3065
02:30:13,530 --> 02:30:17,570
we'll put it on three and St.
so we'll give you different angles to,

3066
02:30:17,880 --> 02:30:20,310
to be a fucking Weirdo,
you know?

3067
02:30:21,510 --> 02:30:23,490
Can we get better,
bigger heads up a couple of days.

3068
02:30:23,491 --> 02:30:26,740
Yes.
My friend Jim Dirksen did know,

3069
02:30:26,790 --> 02:30:30,300
did Erik Didriksen Cim?
Didrikson yeah,

3070
02:30:30,301 --> 02:30:30,770
we'll,
we'll,

3071
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:32,850
uh,
we'll definitely get more advanced time.

3072
02:30:32,880 --> 02:30:34,250
We just figured it out yesterday.
We're going to do,

3073
02:30:34,270 --> 02:30:36,540
and then I put it up and said we're 
going to do it in a couple hours,

3074
02:30:36,930 --> 02:30:41,930
but um,
what we'll do next time is what we're 

3075
02:30:41,930 --> 02:30:42,630
eventually going to do is have a 
specific time we start at every week.

3076
02:30:42,870 --> 02:30:44,360
That sounds like a Wednesday.
Yeah,

3077
02:30:44,550 --> 02:30:47,020
Wednesday afternoons.
Yeah,

3078
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:52,040
you're right.
Because even if we go on the road for 

3079
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:52,040
comedy,
we don't leave until Thursday usually.

3080
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:53,820
So we'll do,
we'll try to do a Tuesday or a Wednesday

3081
02:30:53,821 --> 02:30:54,570
and that's,
we'll do,

3082
02:30:54,571 --> 02:30:57,780
we'll do like late afternoon in La,
like 3:00

3083
02:30:57,781 --> 02:31:02,010
is perfect somewhere around that line 
and we'll do it on a regular basis.

3084
02:31:02,220 --> 02:31:03,100
So,
um,

3085
02:31:03,150 --> 02:31:07,480
this week I'm at the House of Blues on,
um,

3086
02:31:07,560 --> 02:31:08,690
Saturday.
Yeah.

3087
02:31:08,730 --> 02:31:10,130
Saturday night.
The house Friday night,

3088
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:13,950
the House of Blues this Friday in Vegas.
That's January first.

3089
02:31:13,951 --> 02:31:18,951
There's still tickets available for that
New Year's Eve in melrose at the Improv 

3090
02:31:18,951 --> 02:31:19,710
in Hollywood on a Thursday night.
It's sold out.

3091
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,530
So that's sold out,
but there's still some tickets available

3092
02:31:22,531 --> 02:31:24,660
for the house of Blues.
So if you're going to be in Vegas,

3093
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:26,970
um,
Brian's not common unless he wants to,

3094
02:31:27,060 --> 02:31:28,160
wants to change his mind.

3095
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:33,130
Vegas on New Year's Day just seems like 
that dried puke everywhere.

3096
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:36,480
It's hell it August.

3097
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:37,740
Um,
but,

3098
02:31:37,741 --> 02:31:39,390
uh,
New Year's Eve,

3099
02:31:39,391 --> 02:31:40,470
like I said,
it's all sold out.

3100
02:31:40,471 --> 02:31:42,330
Sorry,
but a new year's day,

3101
02:31:42,360 --> 02:31:47,360
January first the house of blues at 
Mandalay Bay and it'd be Joey Diaz and 

3102
02:31:47,941 --> 02:31:50,310
Arash fear far doesn't kill himself for 
them.

3103
02:31:51,150 --> 02:31:53,880
Hopefully won't.
So,

3104
02:31:53,881 --> 02:31:55,500
uh,
thank you very much everybody.

3105
02:31:55,530 --> 02:31:57,300
Thanks for tuning into this and,
uh,

3106
02:31:57,360 --> 02:31:59,220
we'll see you next week.
We're going to do this every week.

3107
02:31:59,221 --> 02:31:59,860
Okay,
bitches.

3108
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:01,110
All right,
thanks.

3109
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:06,400
Stop recording.
