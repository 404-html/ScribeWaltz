1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,380
I studied musical theater.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,040
Did you?

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,520
Yeah.

5
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,020
So you've got a bang actresses.

6
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,400
It was the best.

7
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,323
It was.

8
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,320
It was like they only took 20
kids a year into the course.

9
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,660
3000 people auditioned.

10
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,260
Whoa.

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:16,500
Right.

12
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,940
It was like a very prestigious thing.

13
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,710
It was the same course of Hugh Jackman
did and there was an acting paper.

14
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:24,990
I could not good enough
so I can sing a bit.

15
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,620
So I got in the musical theater
thing and I could back in the day.

16
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:28,981
Yeah.

17
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:29,700
You sing now.

18
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,970
No soundtrack to legit.

19
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,660
I'll tell you.

20
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,100
I'll tell you something about me.

21
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,010
You might not know.

22
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,650
That's a little fact about me.

23
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,610
I Sang,

24
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,350
I sang twice in the Australian opera,

25
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,930
in the course as an employed opera singer.

26
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:43,290
Yeah.

27
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,800
Wow.

28
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:45,180
I was like,

29
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,950
what kind of like what
it became was a little,

30
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,640
I was,

31
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,150
I was,

32
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,510
I've had,

33
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,470
I've had vocal nodules.

34
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,550
I've had surgery on my voice.

35
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,110
I can't over,

36
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,340
I'm not making it up though.

37
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,000
I,

38
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,140
I sang in a,

39
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:58,830
Charles Green was Romeo and Juliet and
Wagner as the flying Dutchman as course

40
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,180
vocal nodules.

41
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,183
Um,

42
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,270
pull ups on your vocal chords.

43
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,420
Basically calluses from smoking coke.

44
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:10,200
A yelling is mostly from yelling from
the bashing together and they get

45
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:10,711
calluses.

46
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,830
So you can actually get your vocal
cords close enough together to make high

47
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,170
sounds because there's always a gap
in him from these little things.

48
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,070
So it makes you a man.

49
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,933
It's like a noodles.

50
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:18,991
He'll fucking man.

51
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:19,824
It's what it is.

52
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,821
Yeah.

53
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,340
Well I guess of course

54
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,310
John Wayne's voice came from exactly.

55
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,140
It's like these,

56
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,630
these grisled comedians who have yelled
on stage or times cause there that is

57
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,464
covered like the,

58
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:31,891
you know,

59
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:32,724
what else is bad?

60
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,390
Like these white Bobby Slayton popped up.

61
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:36,991
I'm telling you,

62
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:37,481
that guy,

63
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,850
his vocal cords is just,

64
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,670
just a nodule or nodular.

65
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,180
I'm telling you,

66
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,730
he might've had a vocal surgery if I'm,

67
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,803
I might be wrong,

68
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,671
but I've,

69
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,600
I've heard of comedians
that have had that before.

70
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,460
It's more than why I had this before.

71
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,890
I was a comedian to try
to save the Singing Korea.

72
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
So he had surgery on the pollups.

73
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:55,931
Yeah.

74
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:56,100
Yeah.

75
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,810
So they shaved down the cows,

76
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,201
couldn't,

77
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,610
couldn't talk for a,

78
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,720
couldn't talk for two months.

79
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,680
Oh my God,

80
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:02,250
two months.

81
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,521
Yeah,

82
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,020
just riding on a fucking pad.

83
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,831
Oh,

84
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,840
that was what that was when I thought,

85
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,741
this job,

86
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:09,840
I'm going to get these back
because I partied too much.

87
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,281
And then I thought,

88
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:12,690
I've got no other skills.

89
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,790
I've got no other skills
in the fucking world.

90
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,240
And I decided I always
wanted to be a comedian,

91
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,400
but it wasn't a job that my
parents would never let me do,

92
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,050
or it wouldn't let you do that.

93
00:02:22,051 --> 00:02:22,701
He said it wasn't,

94
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,560
my parents were happy with the musical
theater because they saw what my mother

95
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:26,700
could brag and act like.

96
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,491
It was a bit more light.

97
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:28,590
He die then the whole thing.

98
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,590
But I decided I was going to be a comedian
in that two months where I couldn't

99
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,424
talk.

100
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,300
I was like a secret that I had to myself.

101
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:36,541
Like,

102
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:37,800
that's fucking awesome.

103
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,820
And I had already,

104
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:39,070
I was,

105
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,820
I was like checking out what
were the open mics were in.

106
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,490
Howard just started
watching a lot of standup,

107
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,070
the videos and,

108
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,610
and that's what I did,

109
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,330
you know,

110
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,200
living by myself,

111
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,490
not talking for a couple of months.

112
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,110
That's fucking awesome.

113
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,771
And,

114
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:53,604
uh,

115
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,460
what was I talking about before with the,

116
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:56,820
Oh,

117
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,200
the great thing about the cost though.

118
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,470
So 10 boys,

119
00:02:59,471 --> 00:02:59,800
10,

120
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,633
10 girls.

121
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:01,580
Uh,

122
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,413
uh,

123
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,440
and there was to e cheese above us.

124
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,551
So there's three years.

125
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,000
So there was,

126
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,060
it was like 90 people in
the whole sort of department

127
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,310
half,

128
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,790
uh,

129
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,600
80% of the men would
guy right in the course.

130
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,800
Let's study musical theater.

131
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,680
So we had [inaudible]
guys and to heterosexuals,

132
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,570
all the women were fucking hot as fuck.

133
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,850
We're like,

134
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,800
like been dancing since I was a kid and
just seeing in fucking night and that we

135
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:33,070
were all like 20.

136
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,980
It was the best thing ever.

137
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,480
I even is the reasonable looking
fucking heterosexual guy because it was

138
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,800
fantastic.

139
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:42,990
Now one of the,

140
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,180
the,

141
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,350
the mind girls in the
course was a go cold.

142
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,950
Uh,

143
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,780
Shantelle Barry and Chantel was going
was the one that we were all like,

144
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,950
she's going to be a star.

145
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,120
She was stunning.

146
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:56,150
You can look her up on the net.

147
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:57,730
She was fucking stunning.

148
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,800
She could sing better than everyone else.

149
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,610
She could.

150
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,030
She was,

151
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,950
she had everything is go right.

152
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,820
And then they brought out
the first version of like
pop auto or American auto or

153
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:13,390
whatever that it was done in Australia
first and was called a miking.

154
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:17,470
The band or whatever real they show it
was actually originated in New Zealand,

155
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,090
but then in Australia
they might just go bang,

156
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,270
called Bardo were all the people came in
and auditioned to be in his goal band.

157
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,790
And the goal that I was at university,

158
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:28,120
she went to this audition for
this TV show she got in the band,

159
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:30,610
but they played it over weeks and weeks
and weeks and they had cameras in the

160
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:30,741
house.

161
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,470
And it was the first reality,

162
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:37,240
big reality show ever where
we were watching these
people just living in a house

163
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,260
and people couldn't fathom whether
there's no act as this is real.

164
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,100
It was like a very,

165
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,291
there,

166
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:42,930
she's there.

167
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:43,763
Yeah.

168
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,711
Anyway,

169
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:45,161
so,

170
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:45,790
uh,

171
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,570
I used to stand behind her stretching
and dance class every and just fucking,

172
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,120
just all I wanted was to have
sex with this young lady.

173
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,463
Never happened.

174
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,423
Right.

175
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,341
So anyway,

176
00:04:55,341 --> 00:05:00,070
so she gets in his band and
she stills the story guy.

177
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,210
She stills on a 10 or $20 out of one of
the other girls who were in the bands a

178
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:08,020
bag and she gets cooked cause
it's fucking cameras everywhere.

179
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,700
So she's got this big opportunity.

180
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,300
Everyone else who was in this band has
gone on to big things like Sophie monk is

181
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:16,840
the model out here dated Ryan Seacrest
for while she was one of the other girls

182
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,810
in the band and now does big
modeling in his movies and Shit.

183
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:20,644
Right.

184
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,740
So he shan't tell gets kicked
out of the fucking bank.

185
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,293
Right.

186
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,243
All over.

187
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:26,741
Right.

188
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:27,610
So she moves over.

189
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:29,140
She's bad press in Australia.

190
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,570
They're all really slagging
her off and what type of stuff?

191
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,970
She was sort of a friend and she,

192
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,990
she moved over to La and I remember
like looking at a myspace page like wow,

193
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:38,751
she's made in an ally.

194
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:41,110
She was backup singing for
Lionel Richie or something.

195
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:41,861
Right.

196
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,650
Like got everything worked out for,

197
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,763
right.

198
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,710
Cut to first season of legit.

199
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,210
We need a goal and a saint that
he's just hot girl number two,

200
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,123
right.

201
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,900
She comes into the audition.

202
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,610
I went fucking hell.

203
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,800
Shantelle she didn't recognize me
or remember me at all and I said,

204
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,201
oh wait,

205
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:02,210
where's your accent from him?

206
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,720
And then I started saying the suburb she
was from from at this and you have two

207
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,381
older sisters?

208
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:06,531
Yeah.

209
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,800
You look like someone who has two to,

210
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,020
cause I used to party it ass Cisco and
I got you got a butterfly tattoo just

211
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,771
above your ass.

212
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:13,790
Just stuff that she goes.

213
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,833
Yeah.

214
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:15,571
And I,

215
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:16,301
when I went away,

216
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:17,630
went to university together.

217
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,011
Right.

218
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:19,551
And then she went,

219
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,570
oh did we find,

220
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:21,010
and then I went,

221
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,290
all right,

222
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,280
give her the pot.

223
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,511
Right.

224
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:25,100
Because I'm a good guy.

225
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,360
The pot had like one line
and then she came on set.

226
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,580
And I think in that moment,

227
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,020
this is how much of an ocelot must be.

228
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,900
She remembered who I was from school

229
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,161
when she came on,

230
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,240
since he came on set,

231
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:38,751
she was like,

232
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,870
cause Jim Jeffrey,

233
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,540
I have my real last name is Nugent.

234
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,970
I use my middle name as a
stage name because of Ted.

235
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,871
No,

236
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:45,681
I just did.

237
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,690
Jim Jefferies sounded
better than Jim Nugent.

238
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,710
Jim Jeffrey,

239
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,281
you know what I mean?

240
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,114
It was just,

241
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,670
it was a little tiny thing
to with alliteration,

242
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,230
you know?

243
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,620
Right.

244
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,330
And so she'll,

245
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,130
she,

246
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,740
I wasn't going by my original name,

247
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:57,640
so she had no reasons.

248
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,100
Right.

249
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,270
And then I sort of reminded,

250
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,541
I said,

251
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,340
how he used to come over and your mommy's
to make this type of food and blah

252
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:02,611
blah blah,

253
00:07:02,611 --> 00:07:02,751
blah,

254
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:02,901
blah,

255
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:02,991
blah,

256
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:03,824
blah.

257
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,390
I think she was so pissed off
that I made it and she didn't.

258
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,380
And I had my own TV show that uh,

259
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,980
she went up to the producer and went,

260
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,401
ah,

261
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:14,300
I've got food poisoning.

262
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,010
I need to go home and
just walked off the set.

263
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,620
What didn't even do the job?

264
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,450
Maybe she's just kinda little squirt.

265
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,313
Maybe she had to leave.

266
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,190
Wait,

267
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,341
wait,

268
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:22,461
wait,

269
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:22,641
wait.

270
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,474
We really

271
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,970
didn't take the Gig man.

272
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,010
What makes you think that
it's because of that?

273
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,720
I just think it's,

274
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,990
I just think people get fucking jealous,

275
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:33,210
man.

276
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,130
We all get jealous.

277
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:35,270
I think she just was like,

278
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,710
fuck this can cause I was the guy at
university that you thought wouldn't make

279
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:40,340
it.

280
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,090
All the other gay guys had abs and
stuff and I was like a bit of a doorway

281
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,520
fucking marshmallow looking kind
of who could sing a little bit,

282
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,520
who couldn't dance at all and
was acting was pretty average.

283
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,460
I always kicked out like five
people a year from the course,

284
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:52,671
like,

285
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:53,504
you're not good enough.

286
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,170
I left after I got the nodules and
I knew I was gonna get kicked out.

287
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:57,860
Anyway,

288
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,641
that was hard.

289
00:07:58,641 --> 00:07:59,720
He rod on the cards.

290
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:02,540
I walked before I jumped
before I was pushed.

291
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,990
That competitive thing of show business
is one of the weirdest aspects of it.

292
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,133
Yeah.

293
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,660
Sometimes even in relationships.

294
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:12,350
I had a friend who got something and his
girlfriend started crying when he got

295
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:15,830
some part in some TV show and his
girlfriend started crying because she was

296
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:15,950
like,

297
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,300
well,

298
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,080
something's going to happen for me.

299
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,560
Like that was her immediate
reaction and I remember thinking,

300
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,430
wow,

301
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,390
I got to get rid of that,

302
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,490
but here's something that's
about to happen to you.

303
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,393
I'm was,

304
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,863
yeah,

305
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,800
that that,

306
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,480
that's a very unattractive,

307
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,650
that competitive things.

308
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,510
He can't help it a little bit.

309
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:36,350
With comedy.

310
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,700
It's very hard to never have
it with any other stope comic.

311
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,600
There's always going to be
one where you go that guy.

312
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,661
But I,

313
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:47,510
I I found out now and I think it's
easier because I got a bit of success,

314
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,580
but I don't give a shit what any,

315
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,840
I just worry about me.

316
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,650
I don't give a fuck if someone's
got a movie or something.

317
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,441
I don't give a fuck.

318
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,560
I just worry about me.

319
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,551
And then you know,

320
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:57,241
the good guys,

321
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,280
you know the bad guys and that's it.

322
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,680
But when in the early days it was more,

323
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,770
I got more jealous at has
that going at that club.

324
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,600
I've been trying to get
into that club forever.

325
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,090
That's just the frustration
of not having made it yet.

326
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,100
And then once you have and
you've got some success,

327
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,870
it goes away and then you can
actually enjoy it for what it is.

328
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,000
I think the successful people who are
still fucking don't want anything other,

329
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,780
well there's a lot of successful people
also that only work with terrible

330
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:23,220
comedian so that they shine.

331
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,800
Have you ever seen like a really good
guy that brings like the fucking worst

332
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,600
guys ever on the road to open forum?

333
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,470
Torch is the audience for a half an
