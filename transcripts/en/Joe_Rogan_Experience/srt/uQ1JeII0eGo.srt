1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,553
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,940
three,
two,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,083
one.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,080
And we're live.
James,

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,130
what's up?
How are you man?

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,160
I'm great.
Don't freak out about your,

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,650
your sound of your voice in the 
headphones.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,010
This is the first time you ever worn 
headphones or a podcast?

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,370
Definitely the first time I've heard 
myself talk because it weird.

10
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,600
After a second.
Yeah.

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,280
That's weird.
You get over it.

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,260
Be conscious about it.
Really.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,150
You got to be all right.
You take them off.

14
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:32,250
You want.
If it's freaking you out too much,

15
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,123
you're going to get through this.
Let's just take this bucket that we 

16
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,280
don't need these things.
Just keep this sucker close to you.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,310
So,
uh,

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,900
first of all,
thanks for doing this.

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,280
You've been on this crazy sort of 
whirlwind tour.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,833
Have you gone anywhere or you just been 
doing it most from mostly from your 

21
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,810
house?
Mostly from my house.

22
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:56,340
Just on skype.
Now for people who don't know the story,

23
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:57,174
let's give them the short version of it.
You were working at Google and what 

24
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,850
prompted you to write this memo?

25
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,973
Yeah.
So they would have these company wide 

26
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,024
meetings where they just push a lot of 
this diversity stuff and some of it was 

27
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:12,090
kind of weird.
So I decided to go to these,

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,220
uh,
these secret meetings,

29
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,054
sort of that we're about 100 people a 
completely unrecorded and they would 

30
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,274
talk about some of the things that 
they're doing and it would really 

31
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:24,540
contradict what they're saying publicly 
where,

32
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,403
oh no,
we're not changing any of our hiring 

33
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:30,420
practices for these candidates.
And they said,

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,373
yeah,
we basically are a making it easier for 

35
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:36,790
some kind of ways to get in.
And I,

36
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,624
you know,
I voiced some concerns but people have 

37
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:41,160
just chain me and was like,
no,

38
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,070
you're wrong.
You're just like,

39
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,460
have white male privilege.

40
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,580
I said,
you have white male privilege.

41
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,380
That was the actual word that he is.
Yeah,

42
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,343
there is a lot of that going on.
And so they asked for feedback on the 

43
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,850
program.
So I,

44
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,110
I wrote this document to clarify my 
thoughts.

45
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,540
I sent it to them,
they looked at it,

46
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,780
but they just ignored it,
never told me anything.

47
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:06,410
So I went to a couple more of these 
programs and you know,

48
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:08,390
I gave similar feedback,
I gave the same document,

49
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,580
they kept looking at it but just never 
said anything and you know,

50
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,270
I would send it to random people that I 
knew and half the people will be like,

51
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:18,260
yes,
exactly.

52
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:19,094
This is what I've been thinking.
And the other half would maybe disagree 

53
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:23,624
with some points,
but it would never be emotional 

54
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:26,900
outbursts or anything.
It would just be like,

55
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,003
oh,
are you sure that this is actually 

56
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:29,660
happening?
And it's like,

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,830
yes,
because,

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,753
you know,
I've actually been to these unrecorded 

59
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,830
meetings.
This is what's happened.

60
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,923
So if you could get into specifics like 
when you're in these meetings and 

61
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:40,840
they're talking about diversity,
what is their concern?

62
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,703
And their,
they're trying to promote an image of 

63
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:46,204
diversity.
Are they trying to promote actual 

64
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:49,150
diversity?
Uh,

65
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:49,984
do they think that there's a benefit for
diversity or is it a part of their 

66
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:53,284
public public image?
And is it a lot of it to avoid 

67
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:56,644
criticism?
Because I think there's a big issue 

68
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,651
with.
I mean,

69
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,570
if you don't have all your bases 
covered,

70
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:03,760
two black women,
two Asian men,

71
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,710
if you don't have all your bases 
covered,

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,750
you can get like pretty roundly 
criticized as not being diverse or being

73
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,480
possibly racist when you do that,
you're kind of fucked.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,833
Yeah.
So Google definitely has a huge target 

75
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:20,810
on its back and so there are people that
want to complain that Oh,

76
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:24,320
Google is not diverse,
therefore it's racist and sexist.

77
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,693
And so that's a lot of their fear that I
look at their representation and then 

78
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:32,210
compare it to the overall us population 
and say,

79
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,950
Oh,
we only have 20 percent women.

80
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,400
We should have 50 percent.
There's obviously some sexism happening.

81
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,060
And so a lot of their stuff is,
oh,

82
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:44,660
we need to fix this because you know,
all this sexism is bad.

83
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,000
And obviously if you disagree with 
sexism,

84
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,480
that's of course bad.
And like I obviously don't want there to

85
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:53,504
be any sexism,
but I just don't think that that's the 

86
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:59,861
sole cause of this disparity in 
representation.

87
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,893
Yeah.
It seems like in the interest of 

88
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,250
promoting an image of diversity,
they're willing to bypass science.

89
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,490
And the truth and the reality of 
culture,

90
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:16,540
the reality of human biology and 
evolutionary psychology,

91
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:17,374
there's just so much that they're 
willing to look past to get to this one 

92
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:25,780
thing which seems to be like this really
important thing today.

93
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:29,680
Society that you want to promote an 
image of diversity.

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:30,933
It's more important than anything.
So like when you're in these classes or 

95
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,041
these,
I mean,

96
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,410
I wouldn't call it a class,
what would you call it?

97
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:36,930
A meeting,
whatever they are.

98
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,470
Some of them are classes somewhere,
you know,

99
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,160
our day long programs teach you things 
like what would they teach you?

100
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,240
They would talk about unconscious bias 
and no,

101
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,920
Oh,
lucky you might be racist.

102
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,330
You have to find the racism in you.

103
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,890
And yeah,
there's a whole program that's trying to

104
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:56,724
retrain your brain to think,
to think about race in a new way or 

105
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:01,180
something.

106
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,100
So they're just assuming you're guilty

107
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,420
pretty much because someone.
Because you're white.

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,350
I.
Well,

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,333
yeah.
I mean they look at the representation 

110
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:10,340
and say,
racism,

111
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,203
sexism.

112
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,070
Do a black people have to go to this?

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,930
I am.
They know one has to have been asked to.

114
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,080
They are definitely pushing it on people
and uh,

115
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,023
now managers are being evaluated by how 
well they promote diversity and 

116
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,314
inclusion and you know,
it's just a slippery slope and I think 

117
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,340
it will eventually become part of our 
performance review.

118
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,570
So if you're a white woman,
do you have to go to this?

119
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:39,741
I mean,
did that,

120
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:41,270
are you encouraged to go to this?
Are you like,

121
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,104
Hey,
you made it through like this will have 

122
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:46,460
been looking for your fine or if you're 
an Indian woman even better,

123
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,503
right?
Is that how it works or would you still 

124
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:51,620
have to go there and approach your 
unconscious biases?

125
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,933
Yeah,
they say everyone has these unconscious 

126
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:55,540
bias

127
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,160
even towards white people.
So do they have those

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,993
where they have like black people with 
their unconscious biases towards white 

129
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,904
people?
So they never acknowledged that anyone 

130
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,780
could be racist against white people.
Of course.

131
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,760
Why would you.
Yeah.

132
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,530
It's all this.
Like if you have,

133
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,573
you can only be racist if you have power
or sexist if you have power and they 

134
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:15,800
believe that the racist part.
Yeah,

135
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:17,780
I think so.
Well that's insane.

136
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,393
That's a redefinition.
It's a very recent redefinition of the 

137
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,320
term racism,
but it's very slippery,

138
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,770
very dangerous because you could see it 
as,

139
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,633
you know,
promoting in fact like exonerating 

140
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,170
racism towards other ethnicities or 
towards white people were towards people

141
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,000
that you feel like are in a privileged 
class.

142
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,073
You'd get away with it because it's no 
big deal because they're the ones who 

143
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:43,790
are racist even if it's not even that 
person.

144
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,760
If it's people who look like them that 
have lived for centuries,

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,990
like somehow or another.

146
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,823
Your,
a guilty person just with your white 

147
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,993
privilege.
So like what would they tell you when 

148
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,120
you would go to these?
Do you do,

149
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,160
did you like express some discontent or.
Yeah,

150
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,090
I didn't.
I,

151
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,953
my main concern was them saying 50 
percent in the population look who only 

152
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:11,340
has 20 percent.
And so we're obviously women.

153
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,283
Yeah.
Yeah.

154
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,830
And you know,
there were clear reasons,

155
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:16,664
at least in my mind that that's not as 
simple as they're making out to be and 

156
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,274
that there are some differences and that
could explain some of the issues that 

157
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:27,164
women are facing.
And so a lot of these women issues in 

158
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,664
tech.
I feel are actually not really gender 

159
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:34,880
issues there.
Just,

160
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,050
uh,
you know,

161
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,810
women on average are more cooperative,
for example,

162
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,830
and so they may find it harder to,
you know,

163
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:43,664
lean in,
in the corporate world like Sheryl 

164
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,360
Sandberg is saying,
but you know,

165
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:50,180
there are men that also feel like that 
I'm not very assertive.

166
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,130
I'm actually pretty shy and so I feel 
the same stuff and it's not that,

167
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,600
you know,
there's a ton of sexism.

168
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,733
It's maybe that male typical behavior is
rewarded just as competitiveness is 

169
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:07,910
rewarded in a lot of corporate world,
but it's not that we're just,

170
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,320
Oh,
you're a woman,

171
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,450
therefore you're obviously bad at 
coding,

172
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:12,800
you know.
No one has ever saying that.

173
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,693
Right.
I think there is absolutely an issue 

174
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,790
with assertive women being treated very 
differently than assertive men.

175
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,210
Like an assertive woman is a bitch.
Like you don't want to be around them.

176
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,011
That's like the,
the,

177
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:25,600
the bias.
And uh,

178
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,483
that's a real issue I think for women 
that want to enter into any sort of a 

179
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:29,834
competitive field.
And you know where a man would be 

180
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:32,864
assertive if a woman does the exact same
thing she's looked down upon or looked 

181
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,070
upon like a problem woman or like 
someone you don't want to work with,

182
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,540
whereas the guy is just ambitious yet,
although some people will twist that and

183
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,374
say that because I didn't,
a lot of it is just they try to fit 

184
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:48,884
their ideology and they see one data 
point and they extrapolate so they see 

185
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,980
these studies and it's true that these 
women are viewed as less

186
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
likable,
but they are seen as just as competent 

187
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,960
and so their performance reviewed isn't 
affected really by being assertive.

188
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,510
It's just that socially they may not be 
as well.

189
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,683
Right.
But then it's got to be a factor in the 

190
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:10,484
way they behave because for men,
a ball busting successful man is 

191
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,540
supposed to be like looked up to like,
oh,

192
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,980
this is the guy who was kicking ass in 
the corporate world.

193
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:20,930
He's doing it right.
Like,

194
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:22,310
you know,
bob is ruthless.

195
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,160
But if Jenny's ruthless,
like you don't want to be around her,

196
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:25,670
you know,
it's a,

197
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,650
it's a weird.
It's just,

198
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,160
that's,
I feel like if there is a real bias with

199
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:32,690
men who,
obviously I don't work in tech,

200
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,060
but I would assume that that would be a 
real bias.

201
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,963
Yeah,
and I mean I think some of the solution 

202
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:41,841
to that is just allowing people to be 
more cooperative and you know,

203
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,670
actually,
so for example,

204
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,504
a google,
you're really rewarded for owning a 

205
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,550
particular project and seeing that one 
project go through,

206
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,980
but if you're someone that is just,
you know,

207
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:53,903
can really help a lot of different 
people and you're not necessarily the 

208
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,820
sole owner of any individual thing,
but you're,

209
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,893
you provide a lot of value to the 
company that isn't really seen as 

210
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,030
positive as someone that really drove 
the project alone.

211
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,220
That's interesting.
Yeah,

212
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,540
that seems like a bad thing for 
teamwork,

213
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,443
right?
Is that just a bad philosophy or 

214
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:19,000
something that got stuck in the way the 
system works?

215
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,570
Sure.
I think it's sorta just,

216
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,750
it's hard to evaluate if I did,
you know,

217
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,920
10 percent of my time on 10 different 
projects and I help them.

218
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,293
That makes sense.

219
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,313
Yeah.
So you'd have to essentially trust the 

220
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:32,474
workers instincts and work ethic and now
the blow back from this has been very 

221
00:10:38,661 --> 00:10:39,620
intriguing,
you know,

222
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:43,010
as an outsider looking at it from the.
When I first heard about it,

223
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,761
you know,
I thought,

224
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:44,594
well,
this mean angry man must have written 

225
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:50,330
some things saying that women's suck at 
tech or they suck at this and you know,

226
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:51,164
and people were reacting to this blatant
misogynistic tribe that are ascribed 

227
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:56,924
that I,
uh,

228
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,470
was,
was hearing about what,

229
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:01,580
when I read it I was so confused because
I was like,

230
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,790
where's the mean stuff?
Like where is this?

231
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:05,743
And you also think that the other thing 
that was really confusing was it some 

232
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:10,940
people were reprinting it without 
citations.

233
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,870
Did that freak you out?
Like when you're being misrepresented?

234
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,170
Yeah.
Especially when people would say,

235
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,240
oh,
it was so unscientific because it didn't

236
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:21,790
have citations.
And that was their entire argument.

237
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,640
Who did it?
Who printed it with outside citations?

238
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,474
Because some major publications 
republished it yet I think it was 

239
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:31,860
Gizmodo or motherboard or something 
like,

240
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,240
why the fuck would they do that without 
citations?

241
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:38,320
That seems so unfair.
Unreasonable and so irresponsible.

242
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,453
I think a lot of these companies just 
have certain narrative that they're 

243
00:11:41,681 --> 00:11:42,940
trying to push.
Yeah.

244
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,930
And so like even,
you know,

245
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,773
I've tried to talk to a lot of these 
reporters and I'll give hour long 

246
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,544
interviews with some of them and at the 
end they'll just write the same sort of 

247
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,970
article of like,
Oh yeah,

248
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:58,804
he's just a misogynist.
And so I think even if I can convince 

249
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:08,551
the individual journalists,
they are under pressure by their boss to

250
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,410
write a certain type of article,

251
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,440
what a weird world we're in right now 
when it comes to that,

252
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,680
because I was looking for something that
could be,

253
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,460
could be like

254
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,660
evidence of massage.
The only thing that I could find,

255
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,420
and this is a very mild criticism,
is that you were saying,

256
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,463
I believe you used the term neurotic,
that women were more likely to be 

257
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,900
neurotic.
Neuroticism.

258
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

259
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,790
That's one where a lot of women go,
well fuck this guy.

260
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,830
That's it.
That's all.

261
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:42,664
I mean,

262
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,280
what'd you base that on?
Yes.

263
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,114
So at there's the psychological big five
personality traits and neuroticism is 

264
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:53,280
just one of them,
right?

265
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,820
That's the actual term that they use and
it's sort of unfortunate that that's the

266
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:58,780
term.
Yeah.

267
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,090
Yeah.
It's that one.

268
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,950
I feel like maybe you could have danced 
around that,

269
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,073
but that's it.
I think it's just I was too much into 

270
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,533
the,
like I've seen the word so often that I 

271
00:13:12,581 --> 00:13:16,900
didn't really associate it with neurotic
and negative connotations.

272
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,873
Yeah.
Well I've seen a bunch of your 

273
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,100
conversations.
I've listened to you talk to Ben Shapiro

274
00:13:23,101 --> 00:13:25,560
and a couple other folks and uh,
you know,

275
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,940
your thought process is very reasonable 
and very wealth sorted out.

276
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:30,774
And another thing that I'm not hearing 
from anybody is how you wrote a whole 

277
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:34,674
page and a half describing all the 
different ways that women could be more 

278
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:43,850
involved in tech or you can encourage 
more women to tackle like,

279
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,693
this is not the work of a massage test.
This is the work of someone who is 

280
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:50,460
carefully considering an issue and 
looking at it from a very.

281
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,630
What I felt like,
and correct me if I'm wrong,

282
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:59,631
but that you felt frustrated that you 
were looking at something that was a,

283
00:14:00,601 --> 00:14:03,240
that people,
the way they're approaching this wasn't.

284
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,280
They weren't looking at it for what it 
was.

285
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,293
They had kind of decided how they were 
going to describe it and how they were 

286
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:11,844
going to deal with it and it wasn't 
really based on facts or reality and 

287
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,044
certainly not on science and you sort of
felt frustrated by this and you decided 

288
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:20,634
to try to interject with as much of the 
current science as you could that could 

289
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:26,640
possibly explain choices.

290
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,720
Not why women are bad at it.
Not why were they,

291
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,820
why they shouldn't be in it,
which is what I kept reading,

292
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:37,830
but more that why women choose to go 
into certain professions.

293
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:38,723
What could be the impediment and what we
could do to maybe encourage more women 

294
00:14:42,361 --> 00:14:43,194
to do it.
Instead of doing this sort of a blanket 

295
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:48,870
style diversity where you're just like,
oh,

296
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:51,470
we need two of these and we do two of 
those.

297
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,830
Which is what I.
I seem to think that they were doing.

298
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,360
Is that,
is that a good assessment?

299
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,740
Yeah.
By the way,

300
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:00,590
this will never trend on youtube.
You might get $5 million hits.

301
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
It'll.
I mean that's a real problem too.

302
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,410
Like there's a lot of censorship when it
comes to these sort of conversations.

303
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,244
Like they would rather look at me who 
looks like a meathead and look at you 

304
00:15:10,971 --> 00:15:11,804
and go,
oh well these fucking guys are just 

305
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:15,260
talking shit about women for an hour.
Right?

306
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,670
I mean,
do you feel that?

307
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,950
Definitely.
And you'll be labeled right now

308
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,590
I've already been labeled.
All right.

309
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,980
Doesn't matter how many left wing 
positions I support.

310
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,340
I look all right.
Which is obviously like sexist,

311
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,690
Short,
misogynist,

312
00:15:33,691 --> 00:15:35,070
racist,
all that stuff.

313
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,790
Yeah.

314
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,623
Well,
but I mean just labeling us because 

315
00:15:38,041 --> 00:15:41,760
we're white man or something.
A certain label because it's.

316
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,630
Yeah,
it's prejudice.

317
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,580
I mean it really is,
but people don't mind prejudices in that

318
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,170
regard.
You know,

319
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,350
they only like,
they don't,

320
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,473
they have an issue with prejudices when 
it comes to what they feel like are 

321
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:58,570
disenfranchised or marginalized people.
But white people,

322
00:15:58,571 --> 00:15:59,500
fuck them.
You know,

323
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,660
he can't,
you know,

324
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,050
that's the thought process,
right?

325
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,580
You can't be racist towards white 
people.

326
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,803
So like what are the most egregious 
things like one of the most ridiculous 

327
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:07,444
things that they were trying to push 
when you were at these classes or 

328
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:10,470
meetings.

329
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,303
So I mean besides the fact of just 
certain things in our hiring process 

330
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:17,214
that would favor certain people which 
would create negative stereotypes for 

331
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,560
people just in general.
So I,

332
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,823
one thing about stereotypes that they 
don't realize is that people will 

333
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,154
automatically create stereotypes no 
matter what and it's based on their 

334
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:32,514
environment.
So we see this with affirmative action 

335
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,294
to in academia where if you create a 
sort of situation where people have 

336
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,270
portions of the population are 
performing differently,

337
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,660
then you'll automatically create the 
stereotype that Oh,

338
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,523
maybe all the Asians are smart and all 
of the other minorities aren't as smart 

339
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,860
in this college.
Right?

340
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:56,694
Because you needed a 1600 to get in if 
you're Asian and you need lower 

341
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,393
otherwise.
And so you'll automatically create that 

342
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:07,710
stereotype.
And that's negative for everyone because

343
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,833
you know,
it creates this tension between the 

344
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,110
groups and they self segregate because 
of that,

345
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,500
while if you just put everyone in the 
same level,

346
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,930
then they'll just intermingle and it'll 
be great.

347
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,660
And so,
you know,

348
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,560
that has its negative consequences and 
it may be illegal,

349
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,220
which is what I was trying to say in my 
document.

350
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,120
So that aspect I think is bad.
But then also,

351
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,570
you know,
once you think that,

352
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,463
oh,
all of this is because of sexism and 

353
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,230
even though we can't really see overt 
signs of sexism,

354
00:17:43,231 --> 00:17:44,250
like,
Oh yeah,

355
00:17:44,251 --> 00:17:45,084
you're a woman,
therefore you are bad and no one is 

356
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,264
saying these sexist slurs or then it 
must be some low level bias that we all 

357
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:54,174
have and that's why they're pushing all 
this unconscious bias and 

358
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:01,590
microaggressions and just increasing 
every one sensitivity to,

359
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,023
oh you said something that could be 
interpreted in this one weird way and 

360
00:18:07,591 --> 00:18:12,120
that might offend someone somewhere.
Therefore you should never say anything.

361
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,600
And it's really stifling.
Well,

362
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,523
I think we would all agree that we would
all be better off if we treated people 

363
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,820
nicer.
If we,

364
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,900
if we didn't have racism,
if we didn't have sexism,

365
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:28,734
we just appreciate it.
People for their qualities and just 

366
00:18:30,511 --> 00:18:33,270
could be very objective about that.
Um,

367
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,690
but when you're,
I would imagine that when you're running

368
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:39,450
a company as large as something like 
Google,

369
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,403
you kind of have to put fires out before
you even see smoke and like the 

370
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:49,401
writing's on the wall when it comes to 
criticism today and anything that,

371
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,220
that people can point to when it,
when it's,

372
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,220
whether it's,
um,

373
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,390
a percentage of women,
the percentage of minorities,

374
00:18:57,391 --> 00:18:59,820
whatever it is,
where that they feel like is off.

375
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:01,800
I mean,
people will write articles about this.

376
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:04,650
It can damage your stock profile,
right?

377
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,580
I mean it can,
it can,

378
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:06,414
like companies can take a hit on the 
stock market because of an article that 

379
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:11,520
someone could write about a lack of 
diversity.

380
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:12,151
Like,
oh Geez,

381
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,700
they all lack of diversity.
Like that's a real issue.

382
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:17,470
Yeah.
And there have been reports of companies

383
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,400
that'll have these diversity programs.
And then blackmail companies,

384
00:19:21,401 --> 00:19:24,820
if they don't take them,
so say you know,

385
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,860
they'll start complaining because you 
know,

386
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:27,694
all of these companies are the same and 
that they have about 20 to 30 percent 

387
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:34,060
women so they could do the same attack 
against anyone.

388
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,470
And so they blackmail,
accompany,

389
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,473
say,
Oh,

390
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,493
you need to do these certain programs 
and if you don't then we'll start doing 

391
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,553
external pressure on you.
So who are the companies that are 

392
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:50,350
blackmailing them for the groups?
At least from what I've heard.

393
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,600
And this is all secondhand.
It's uh,

394
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:53,643
a lot of the programs that.
So they'll hire contractors to perform 

395
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,080
some of the diversity programs.

396
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,010
Oh.
So they have like,

397
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,913
sort of like Jesse Jackson,
you should do with the rainbow 

398
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,200
coalition.
You know,

399
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:05,580
the story behind that.
A little.

400
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,640
This is the,
uh,

401
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:07,923
second secondhand story.
But the second hand store was that he 

402
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:15,171
would go into these groups and uh,
if anybody had said something,

403
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,223
uh,
whatever reason they had to get into 

404
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,820
this company,
they would go into this company and then

405
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,654
they would charge them a tremendous 
amount of money to go in and create 

406
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:25,974
these diversity programs.
And if they didn't do that then they 

407
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:31,530
would shame the company and they will 
claim the company was racist.

408
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,550
Know Jesse Jackson had like this laundry
list of things you wanted,

409
00:20:35,551 --> 00:20:39,240
like jumbo shrimp cocktail and all this 
crazy shit and live I'll ride.

410
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,390
But really like it's been kind of 
documented,

411
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,553
you know,
I mean I'd have to go back over it 

412
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,190
again.
I remember it only barely,

413
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,040
but the,
I

414
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,910
mean that's where he got that moniker 
race pimp that will,

415
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,690
he was essentially doing was race 
pimping and then he was going around and

416
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,673
you know,
kind of threatening people that we will 

417
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,810
call you a racist,
we'll call your company racist,

418
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,080
comply in this manner.
And

419
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,400
that.
That's scary.

420
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,700
Yeah.
And I mean I see that a lot at google.

421
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:11,570
Not necessarily,
you know,

422
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:12,404
the same threatening,
but just people feel that they have to 

423
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:15,584
walk on eggshells,
otherwise they'll get reported to hr by 

424
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,024
some random activists within the company
because you have activists in the 

425
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:23,810
company.
Yeah.

426
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,150
And you know,
that was sort of made public,

427
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,680
uh,
you know,

428
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:28,514
with all of this where there were some 
people that just really pushed and 

429
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:35,780
started complaining a ton based on my 
document.

430
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,853
They would email my hr,
everyone up my management chain and 

431
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:44,951
they'd write all these posts and try to 
coordinate people to really shamed me.

432
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,853
And then they started tweeting about it 
after and that's how it leaked 

433
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,080
externally.
Woo.

434
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,630
What was the criticism of the memo?
Like did anything make sense?

435
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:57,960
Did anything make you go,
hmm,

436
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,170
I could have worded that better.

437
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,330
I obviously the neuroticism.
Yeah.

438
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,640
I,
I could have worded that differently.

439
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:05,763
I,
I,

440
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,890
the fact that I didn't talk about all 
the biases are that are against women as

441
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:12,514
much,
but it was really that this was in 

442
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,713
google internal document and so we 
already have so much stuff about the 

443
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,214
potential biases against women.
And this was just the other side of the 

444
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:24,814
story,
the other perspective that wasn't being 

445
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:29,340
heard.
So yeah,

446
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,210
I,
I,

447
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,573
I,
I don't really know any criticism that 

448
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,890
was really.
Oh yeah,

449
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,860
that was definitely.
I should have done that

450
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:41,803
man.
I'm so how you would put this memo out 

451
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:49,130
there and then the memo got leaked and 
then once it got leak you got fired.

452
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,960
Yeah.
As soon after.

453
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,090
But they knew about the memo already.
Right.

454
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,440
So.
And they were cool with it.

455
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,990
Like how long had the memo had been 
floating around?

456
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,180
About a month.
Wow.

457
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,940
So as soon as it went public,
like yikes.

458
00:23:01,941 --> 00:23:04,190
Get rid of them.
Yeah.

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,833
Wow.

460
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,590
It was,
it seemed to just be a PR thing.

461
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,810
Of course.
Yeah.

462
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,050
But it's also a,
it's weak,

463
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,640
you know,
and it's like,

464
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,640
it's really disturbing that someone 
couldn't look at this for what it really

465
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,880
is like this is an opportunity to have a
discussion about the subject,

466
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,460
you know what I mean?
Here's this very detailed thing.

467
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:29,200
If you guys disagree with it,
let's debate it.

468
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,580
Let's talk about it.
Like I said,

469
00:23:30,581 --> 00:23:34,800
the only thing that I thought was even 
remotely derogatory was that one word or

470
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,930
that one idea that women are more prone 
to neuroticism.

471
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,213
Other than that,
it just seemed to me to be evolutionary 

472
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,620
psychology.
It seemed to be like a lot of stuff that

473
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,640
has already been really well researched

474
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,300
and this is some pretty clear 
differences and again,

475
00:23:50,301 --> 00:23:51,134
it's not all women or all men,
but there's a tremendous amount of 

476
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,364
evidence that shows that males lean 
towards certain professions and females 

477
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,590
lead towards other professions.

478
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,073
Yeah,
and these are based on surveys of like 

479
00:24:03,431 --> 00:24:06,250
half a million people,
so people are saying,

480
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:07,084
Oh yeah,
this is just one study of the child is 

481
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,561
like,
no,

482
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:12,640
it's 90 different studies across many 
different countries and you know,

483
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,543
there have been even experiments that 
length this to just prenatal 

484
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:18,580
testosterone.
Yeah.

485
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:22,570
Which is pretty strong evidence that 
there's some biological link.

486
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,270
We're all also,
if you have a company like Google,

487
00:24:25,271 --> 00:24:27,880
which by the way,
before we go any further,

488
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm a big fan of Google use their 
products all the time.

489
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:31,660
I have a google phone.
I mean,

490
00:24:31,661 --> 00:24:35,230
I think they're amazing.
I think that browser is excellent.

491
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,191
Uh,
I like,

492
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:40,090
I use chrome,
I think they kick ass every morning.

493
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:43,330
I go to my phone and I check the google 
news.

494
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:45,490
I have a whole setup,
but that's one of the first things I do.

495
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:47,530
I check the news on my phone from 
Google,

496
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,320
so it's not like I'm an google person,
but

497
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,260
if,
if

498
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,563
there wasn't some sort of evolutionary 
psychology reason or some sort of a 

499
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:59,543
prenatal testosterone reason or some 
biological reason why people were 

500
00:25:02,821 --> 00:25:04,830
inclined to choose one profession over 
another,

501
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,060
google would have to be a fucking 
horrible company.

502
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,163
If everything was.
Even if everybody was 50 slash 50 and 

503
00:25:12,371 --> 00:25:15,180
they're only hiring 20 percent women,
that means they're monsters.

504
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,230
They're suppressing 30 percent of the 
weather.

505
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,260
They're just like,
fuck you,

506
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:21,420
you can't work here.
You can't get hired.

507
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,270
You're just as good as us,
but fuck off is a man's club.

508
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,860
They would have to be monsters.

509
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,103
Yeah.
And that's why I feel like some people 

510
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,650
are shaming me.
Like,

511
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,513
oh,
this is such a bad thing to tell little 

512
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:33,524
girls that are interested in technology 
when really I think this is a much 

513
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:38,040
better view of the world where it just 
you,

514
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,920
yeah.
If you're interested in technology,

515
00:25:39,921 --> 00:25:42,400
great.
There aren't as many women my queue,

516
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,330
but if you are,
that's amazing.

517
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,210
While the other side of the story is,
oh no,

518
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,103
even if you are,
then you'll find face all these 

519
00:25:50,511 --> 00:25:51,344
challenges and it'll just be an uphill 
battle against sexism and you'll never 

520
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,813
be seen as good as a man and you know 
that's not very encouraging to a lot of 

521
00:25:59,271 --> 00:25:59,950
people.

522
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,940
Well,
it sounds so not.

523
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:06,030
It's not necessarily accurate.
You're kind of like bending the truth to

524
00:26:06,491 --> 00:26:08,320
meet your narrative.
You know,

525
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:12,340
where instead we should maybe look at 
what are the differences between men and

526
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:13,174
women,
but that's the thing people don't want 

527
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:15,244
to even accept.
There's a trend today to not accept 

528
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:20,740
biological differences between the 
sexes,

529
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,620
which is just fucking bananas.
Like let's just not.

530
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,140
Let's not accept the fact that water 
gets your wet.

531
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,573
It's just weird.
It's weird when people ignore truth to 

532
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,163
fit their ideology and when you're 
looking at like just sheer numbers of 

533
00:26:35,141 --> 00:26:37,240
people,
all you have is these numbers.

534
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,400
I mean you could have a bunch of reasons
why,

535
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,413
but to say that the only reasons our 
implicit biases that the only reason 

536
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:49,440
this is some sort of discrimination 
against women,

537
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,150
that's the only reason why they're not 
50 slash 50.

538
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,460
That's crazy.
That means we're monsters,

539
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,391
right?
I mean,

540
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,180
doesn't it mean more monsters?
That means all men are monsters.

541
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,390
Yeah.
When it's often the exact opposite,

542
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,880
you know,
we're very welcoming of women.

543
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:07,610
We really want every woman that we can 
get and you,

544
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,223
they'll even twist these studies that 
they have where they'll do these large 

545
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:14,160
analyses of,
Oh,

546
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:14,994
why did you leave tech?
And it will be broken down by men and 

547
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,474
white men and it'll show a 30 percent of
women felt like there was unfair 

548
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:22,314
treatment and harassment and then a one 
in 10 women felt like there was undue 

549
00:27:27,391 --> 00:27:31,170
sexual attention to them and then the 
media will just report on that.

550
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,460
But they don't see that 40 percent of 
men compared to 30 percent of women felt

551
00:27:35,461 --> 00:27:39,810
like there was a unfair trade,
men or harassment and then one in 12 men

552
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,510
felt like there was a,
you know,

553
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,860
unwanted sexual attention.
So,

554
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,340
you know,
they completely disregard the other side

555
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:48,930
of the narrative that,
you know,

556
00:27:48,931 --> 00:27:49,764
it's not really a gender issue,
that there's just unfair treatment in 

557
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:53,874
general,
you know?

558
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:55,843
Well I think men are gross.
I wouldn't want to work with them in an 

559
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:58,904
office.
I mean if I was a woman I would think 

560
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:02,630
that would be the worst place to work 
because in an office with men,

561
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:03,464
especially if I was attractive and it 
was just around a bunch of goons or 

562
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:08,390
staring at my butt and just saying 
stupid shit.

563
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,253
Men are gross.
I mean I think like generally is an 

564
00:28:11,001 --> 00:28:14,660
issue with men and women working 
together because a lot of men are gross.

565
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,300
You know?
I mean it's not all of us obviously,

566
00:28:17,301 --> 00:28:19,790
but I mean just if I want to be honest 
about it,

567
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,420
I would say that men,
I think women probably have to deal with

568
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:24,254
a lot of shit.
But is that the reason why only 20 

569
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:28,994
percent of them are in tech because 
that's not the case with all jobs where 

570
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,880
they work together and I think men are 
gross across the board.

571
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,073
They're not just growth in tech.
I mean they're probably grows like what 

572
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:39,734
our jobs were.
Women are disproportionately 

573
00:28:41,061 --> 00:28:43,400
represented.
I'm like on the other side,

574
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:45,590
like is it like a healthcare center?

575
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:50,740
Nursing veterinarians schools.
So a lot of things that deal with people

576
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:52,670
or animals in this case.

577
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,683
Yeah.
Well I bet they deal with gross dudes 

578
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,153
there too here.
But that doesn't stop them from being 

579
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:04,520
hired at a disproportionally favorable 
number percentage.

580
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,050
Yeah.
It's um,

581
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,930
we got to look a,
I think collectively.

582
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:09,764
Here's one good thing.
Here's the good thing about Google 

583
00:29:10,731 --> 00:29:11,564
because I don't want to trash on Google.
And the good thing about tech companies 

584
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:14,744
in general,
I feel like we are in a way better 

585
00:29:17,511 --> 00:29:22,430
position that tech companies are leaning
way left.

586
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,413
I think we're in a way better position 
socially that tech companies are being 

587
00:29:26,571 --> 00:29:30,950
extremely concerned about diversity 
because you just don't feel that.

588
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,903
And a lot of companies where they are 
about the hard line there about the 

589
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:35,510
bottom line,
making money,

590
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,070
kicking ass,
taking names,

591
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,380
pushing the company ahead.
And they're,

592
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:40,240
they're,
they're about,

593
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:41,410
you know,
infinite growth.

594
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,620
This is not what I see from tech 
companies.

595
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,453
What I see from tech companies is 
extreme caution when it comes to social 

596
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:53,791
issues and this extreme desire to be 
thought of as being very diverse,

597
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:56,170
very fair,
very liberal.

598
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,210
I think that's good.
I really do.

599
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:59,044
I think it balances it out.
And I also think when I think at least 

600
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,184
about the smartest people in the world 
or the most innovative people in the 

601
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,460
world today,
I almost always think about tech because

602
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:10,930
I think about like,
well you look,

603
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:15,340
if you looked at the human organism,
you can look at the human organism,

604
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,073
the human species as a whole.
And if you looked at like what does it 

605
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,800
do that's most impressive?
Well,

606
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:21,723
what is does is his constant innovation 
and this constant desire to make things 

607
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:28,480
more and more efficient,
faster,

608
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,510
more capable that that's a big part of 
that is tech.

609
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,970
So the people that are like in a lot of 
ways,

610
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:34,804
at least the most technically creative,
those people are oftentimes very left 

611
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:43,330
wing and very liberal.
So I liked the fact that Google has this

612
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:44,164
as a thought process.
I just wish that it was unbiased in its 

613
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,920
determinations when it comes to biases.
Does that make sense?

614
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:54,863
Yeah.
So I agree that being progressive isn't 

615
00:30:57,451 --> 00:31:00,660
necessarily a bad thing and you know,
I,

616
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,500
it is great that Google has this don't 
be evil motto and you know,

617
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,080
they've decided,
oh yeah,

618
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:07,914
we get a ton of ad revenue,
therefore we can do a ton of random 

619
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:12,870
stuff that's good for the world and 
shit.

620
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,943
But you know,
I think unfortunately there are 

621
00:31:15,301 --> 00:31:16,134
political bias has created yet they've,
they haven't forgotten their don't be 

622
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,653
evil motto.
It's just that don't be evil has turned 

623
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:29,361
into just don't disagree with us and 
what our ideology says they got sloppy.

624
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,340
Yeah,
yeah.

625
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,960
Well they're just a little off,
but they're going the right way,

626
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,941
you know,
and look,

627
00:31:37,941 --> 00:31:41,150
it's very difficult to fucking.
I mean,

628
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:41,984
how could you run a giant company like 
that and be just totally cool and above 

629
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:48,080
ground and have it all worked out?
I mean,

630
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,310
it just doesn't happen.
You know,

631
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,870
and especially when you have all these 
internal influences,

632
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,850
like you're talking with these activists
that work,

633
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,863
that have,
they have a vested interest in proving 

634
00:31:59,361 --> 00:32:01,340
that there's racism,
there's a vested interest,

635
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,990
like when you go looking for a,
uh,

636
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,360
you know,
if you have a hammer,

637
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,950
everything becomes an issue,
right?

638
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,903
If you're a person who's the type of 
person that's looking for racism 

639
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:11,630
everywhere,
fuck man.

640
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:13,320
You're going to find it in all these 
weird places.

641
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:14,780
So like that.
Don't even make sense.

642
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,460
Like these hidden unconscious biases 
where you have to examine yourself.

643
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,540
Don't just look at overt actions and see
whether or not those actions or racism.

644
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:24,410
Yep.
Racist.

645
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:28,940
You have to actually examine all your 
thoughts and try to find racist thoughts

646
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:31,390
and because they are in there,
whether you want to believe it or not,

647
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,240
right?
Oh,

648
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,910
Jesus isn't.
God damn goes ton.

649
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,300
You know,
this is a witch hunt

650
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,370
[inaudible].
It's like,

651
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,950
it's not.
I like,

652
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:40,784
again,

653
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:41,803
even though I'm a white man,
I really feel like it's leaning better 

654
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,840
that we're shitting on white men.
Then,

655
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,370
you know,
if it was the other way,

656
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,840
if we were shitting on minorities,
I mean it would be very disturbing if an

657
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:56,270
enormous company like Google was going,
well let's just,

658
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,320
let's be honest.
Puerto Ricans are lazy.

659
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,313
Know,
like,

660
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,253
Whoa,
but if a company comes along like 

661
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:02,871
Google,
it's like,

662
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:03,350
well,
you know,

663
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,183
white,
you can't be racist towards white 

664
00:33:05,301 --> 00:33:06,134
people.
Like,

665
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,060
okay,
like least we can work here.

666
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:09,530
We could talk,
we can talk about this,

667
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:10,364
but this is,
you're saying something fucking crazy 

668
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:12,523
racist.
I know you don't think it's crazy and 

669
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:14,624
racist because you're trying so hard to 
not be racist towards minorities that 

670
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:19,970
you're looking at what's a temporary 
majority?

671
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:22,310
I mean white people only majority for 
another decade.

672
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,070
Right?
You know,

673
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:29,610
I hope it evens out,
but I feel like in defense of Google,

674
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:34,250
it's better to be leaning incorrectly in
that direction

675
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,220
than to go the other way.
Yeah,

676
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,080
I mean,
I think it's fine to have a leaning.

677
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:39,914
It's just you need to not be blind to 
the other side and I think that that's 

678
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,620
what's happening right now.
Yeah.

679
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,603
Where you know,
they're completely shutting down the 

680
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:48,044
conversation and they're really making 
certain employees feel completely 

681
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:54,200
alienated.
Well,

682
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,640
yeah.
It seems like you can't,

683
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,880
obviously you tried to talk about it and
you were fired.

684
00:33:58,970 --> 00:33:59,660
Yeah.
No,

685
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,493
I mean you were,
you were shamed for a little while and 

686
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:04,040
then it went public and then you were 
fired.

687
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,410
Now why did,
did they do,

688
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,453
did they send it publicly because they 
knew that people would have a negative 

689
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:11,360
reaction towards it?
That's what I think.

690
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,650
Yeah.
I didn't know who did it.

691
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,783
It was probably the people that were 
tweeting about it and saying that I was 

692
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:18,240
just a massage and it's Nazi person.

693
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,610
I don't see.
Yeah,

694
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,720
I definitely used white supremacists.
Nazi was used.

695
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:24,763
Yeah.
They just keep escalating and at some 

696
00:34:26,811 --> 00:34:28,930
point I don't really know it'll happen.
You know,

697
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,090
white supremacists is now being used for
a lot of things.

698
00:34:32,091 --> 00:34:35,240
You're a white supremacist somehow.
Wow.

699
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:39,290
And at some point people will just see 
no,

700
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:41,650
these people aren't actually that and 
you know,

701
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,533
they've just create a bubble of words 
that they say and it just keeps getting 

702
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:47,864
more and more extreme and at some point 
it'll just shatter like an economic 

703
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:53,054
bubble,
but I,

704
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,690
but that's very dangerous because it 
opens a door to competition to google,

705
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:57,883
like someone who is more rational.
And I think that's unfortunate for 

706
00:35:00,651 --> 00:35:04,340
google to like to be supporting these 
ridiculous ideas.

707
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,713
Like I've read this one article with 
this woman was calling you a misogynist 

708
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:10,010
and uh,
it was like a,

709
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:10,540
she was

710
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,510
being really brutal,
but it was,

711
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,660
it was a total false narrative because I
was listening,

712
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,650
I was reading it and I was trying to,
like,

713
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,800
I'd read your memo.
So I read your memo and then I read this

714
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:24,940
article about your memo.
I'm like,

715
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,803
this is like an angry person that has 
just decided that this is the focus of 

716
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:31,684
all the woes of the world is James and 
I'm going to shit on James and the 

717
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:36,904
massages the world.
Like James are the reason why women 

718
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,300
can't excel in tech.

719
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,470
Yeah.
And I think part of that is that there's

720
00:35:44,471 --> 00:35:45,304
just an asymmetry,
so there's no punishment for writing 

721
00:35:47,741 --> 00:35:51,680
this really angry letter that says how 
misogynist I am,

722
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:57,270
even though that's a negative to me and 
anyone else that has similar viewpoints.

723
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,163
So there really needs to be some sort of
retribution maybe for people that just 

724
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:05,680
so openly are so negative,

725
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,480
you could just get away with it.
Yeah.

726
00:36:07,481 --> 00:36:10,030
And then no one questions it.
It's not open for debate.

727
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,013
That's really part of the problem.
It's like people are so looking for 

728
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:16,780
things to be racist that when someone 
cries racism,

729
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,450
if you debate it at all,
like,

730
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,393
well how is he racist?
Like you become a Nazi for like 

731
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,050
discussing things.
Even if you,

732
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,203
even if you just objective go over the 
facts and don't agree with their 

733
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:33,850
assessment,
you become a racist.

734
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,670
Yeah.
And you know,

735
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:37,950
even if you don't say anything that's 
overtly racist,

736
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:38,910
they'll say,
oh yeah,

737
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:43,911
that's just dog whistling and Oh yeah,
you can tell what he meant when he said

738
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,650
sad.
The could see it in his eyes.

739
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,343
This is I,
this is not hyperbole what I'm going to 

740
00:36:51,331 --> 00:36:52,890
say.
But this is real.

741
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,780
This is how mccarthyism got started.
This is how it got started.

742
00:36:57,781 --> 00:37:00,610
Everyone was looking for communists and 
every.

743
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,960
You couldn't even explore what communism
was like.

744
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:06,570
You couldn't be confused.
Like if I read a book today,

745
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,930
like I've got a book over there by 
Michael Malice on North Korea.

746
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,853
If I read a book on North Korea like,
well what's what's going on in North 

747
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,673
Korea?
People wouldn't be like Joe Rogan's a 

748
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:17,940
North Korean supporter.
He wants to move to North Korea.

749
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,080
He wants us all to be under a communist 
dictatorship wrong by Kim Jong Moon.

750
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,730
He was like,
you wouldn't say that,

751
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,990
right?
Well,

752
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,670
back then you would.
Back then during the mccarthy era,

753
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,653
it gives you started reading like 
communist newsletters or you started 

754
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:35,760
going to a meeting,
like what?

755
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,643
What is this all about?
You could get shamed run out of 

756
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,800
Hollywood,
and it was a giant issue and people were

757
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,740
ratting on people and they were doing it
for the same reasons.

758
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,290
They did not want to be lumped in with 
this group,

759
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,000
so they would immediately turn people 
down.

760
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:48,834
They were turning in.
Their neighbors were like scary time 

761
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:52,680
where people were looking for the 
communists.

762
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,870
Everybody's looking for the dirty red 
scare,

763
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,940
you know,
they're going to come and infiltrate our

764
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:01,220
world.
It's very similar because it's,

765
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,330
it's a mindset,
this,

766
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:03,820
uh,
um,

767
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,653
this mindset of not looking at things 
objectively but having everything boxed 

768
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:12,600
into these very convenient packages and 
this is one of them,

769
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:13,434
that diversity is of the utmost 
importance and that anything that does 

770
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:18,054
not challenge that idea or anything that
does not support that idea rather is 

771
00:38:22,111 --> 00:38:22,944
racist.

772
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,863
Yeah.
And that was sort of what I was trying 

773
00:38:25,191 --> 00:38:28,070
to say when I said demoralized diversity
because,

774
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:28,923
you know,
we've just put on such a pedestal and 

775
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:31,823
we've stopped looking at the costs and 
benefits of it and we've just started 

776
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:36,700
looking for villains,
you know,

777
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:41,701
all the racists and we just want to 
punish those villains and an label.

778
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:42,754
Anyone that disagrees with any of the 
precepts of diversity as some sort of 

779
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,250
evil person.

780
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,270
Well,
it just sort of foolish approach,

781
00:38:50,271 --> 00:38:51,104
especially the approach of making Asian 
people get higher scores that is so 

782
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:55,940
racist.
Like,

783
00:38:55,941 --> 00:38:57,890
yeah,
they study harder and do better.

784
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,410
What's the reason?
I don't know,

785
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,020
whatever the reason is they do it.
I mean,

786
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,820
is it cultural?
Probably.

787
00:39:04,821 --> 00:39:07,070
Is it a biological.
I don't know what,

788
00:39:07,071 --> 00:39:07,904
but whatever reason it is the correct 
response that is not make Asians get 

789
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,760
higher scores.
That's fucking insane.

790
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:17,060
Super Racist.
You know?

791
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:19,880
I mean how racist is that?
That's crazy.

792
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:20,923
Like why are they.
I mean and there are minority which is 

793
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:23,714
even weirder,
but it's somehow or another that one is 

794
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:28,060
like we let that one slide because we 
know they,

795
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,640
they don't complain and they kick ass 
and they'd go and study hard.

796
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,090
So for some reason we like let that one 
slip.

797
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:36,523
Yeah.
And a lot of this has some really 

798
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:42,980
nefarious history were the beginnings of
just,

799
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,650
you know,
we used to just have tests and then that

800
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:48,110
would be how you got into Harvard for 
example,

801
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,450
and whoever has the highest score we get
in,

802
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,643
but then they saw,
oh there's too many Jewish people 

803
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,340
getting in.
And so they started adding all this,

804
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,830
oh,
let's look at your extra curriculars and

805
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:05,600
let's make it more subjective on who we 
get in and that,

806
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,730
that way they could discriminate against
Jewish people.

807
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:09,020
Really.
So that's how it started.

808
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,340
Yeah.
And this was like early 1900.

809
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,600
Wow.
Wow.

810
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,710
Well yeah,
there's another one.

811
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:15,544
There's a,
there's a disproportion amount of 

812
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:18,820
European Jews that are Nobel prize 
winners.

813
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:19,900
Right?
Why?

814
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,640
Well,
they're fucking smart.

815
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,883
Like what?
What does,

816
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,700
what does that mean?
Does that mean that we're,

817
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:28,360
we're prejudice against Irish people 
know what does it mean?

818
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,440
Well,
what it,

819
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,650
whatever it means.
The end result is what's significant.

820
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,740
We're not stopping other people from 
taking these tests.

821
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:37,700
Right.
If you get a disproportion amount,

822
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,260
portion amount of European Jews,
there should be some sort of study in.

823
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:43,270
There has been.
But there should be some sort of studies

824
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:45,490
as to what is it culturally like,
what is it?

825
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:47,110
What is the significance?
Like what,

826
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,123
what has happened in the past that led 
this one group of people to be 

827
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:53,860
extraordinary,
successful,

828
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:58,060
extraordinarily successful in one area.
Well that's what we should study.

829
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:01,600
We should try to keep Jewish people out.
That's fucking insane.

830
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,733
And it's racist and I think Asian people
are not complaining the same way other 

831
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:11,890
folks would know with the same exact 
issue.

832
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,300
You know?
I mean,

833
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:17,290
it's essentially a reverse affirmative 
action sort of a situation.

834
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,573
Really Weird.

835
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,850
Yeah.
It's unfortunate.

836
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:21,684
I mean,
especially since many of these are just 

837
00:41:23,341 --> 00:41:24,174
first generation immigrants,
they don't feel like they necessarily 

838
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:30,240
have the power to really stand up to 
some of this.

839
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,880
Do you,
uh,

840
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,713
have any very Asian friends?
Have you ever been around like really 

841
00:41:35,181 --> 00:41:36,620
strict Asian households?

842
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,623
Yeah,
the culture is definitely different and 

843
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:43,510
there is a higher priority on school and
more traditional values.

844
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,503
I had a good buddy of mine when I was 
young who was Korean and he was in 

845
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:52,340
medical school and his parents were 
Burger udl.

846
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:56,300
I mean they just wanted a's across the 
board.

847
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,163
No fucking excuses.
You will study until your hands bleed 

848
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,483
and you know,
there was just this sort of culture of 

849
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,480
success in that household and have work 
hard work and hard work ethic.

850
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,040
And you know,
the family's idea was like,

851
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:16,670
look,
we came over to America from South Korea

852
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,980
so that you could kick ass,
period.

853
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,750
You're not going to come over here and 
fuck off.

854
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,450
And obviously he was a fucking straight 
a student and a,

855
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,500
just a wizard.
I mean this dude was just always awesome

856
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,210
at everything and always working really 
hard.

857
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:31,890
But he was completely stressed out all 
the time and everything.

858
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,150
And he's like,
but just getting everything done.

859
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:36,860
But I mean it's the culture that he grew
up in.

860
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,810
So to discriminate against that guy and 
say,

861
00:42:38,811 --> 00:42:41,350
well you work too hard.
Yeah,

862
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,530
junk shit.
You can't,

863
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,311
you know,
you know,

864
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:46,160
your scores are a little bit too high.
You don't like it.

865
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,740
So we're gonna we're gonna need a higher
threshold for you.

866
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,203
That's racist.

867
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,320
Yeah.
And there's nothing that they can do.

868
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,350
You can't work harder and know.

869
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,443
No,
it's stupid.

870
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,360
It's like saying to athletes like 
certain athletes so,

871
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:00,781
well,
you know,

872
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:01,614
you've been training too hard and so 
we're going to need a faster 40 yard 

873
00:43:04,951 --> 00:43:07,860
dash from you than a regular person to 
get on the team.

874
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,360
He would never say that.
You would say,

875
00:43:09,361 --> 00:43:10,194
well,
this guy is obviously super dedicated 

876
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,530
and gifted.
This is the guy we want our team.

877
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:18,860
And that's the one thing where I feel 
like we don't see a lot of this stuff.

878
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,230
You know,
uh,

879
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,063
we,
we like results when it comes to 

880
00:43:22,711 --> 00:43:25,020
athletics.
When it comes to things like,

881
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,480
what's your number?
Like,

882
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,470
what is the fastest you can run?
What is,

883
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,260
how high can you jump?
What's the pole vault that you do,

884
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,660
you know,
how far do you throw a disc?

885
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:37,050
Is all those things like very clear,
very clear numbers.

886
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,153
You can't,
you can do that sort of same sort of 

887
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:42,930
approach that you're dealing with 
academics or with industry.

888
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,210
You can't do that approach.
When it comes to athletics,

889
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,980
[inaudible],
it's,

890
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,023
I mean,
I'm not suggesting that the whole world 

891
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:52,520
is a sport,
but I mean when,

892
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:57,620
when it comes to things like scores and 
keeping people out and letting people in

893
00:43:58,351 --> 00:43:59,184
and trying to push to get more people of
a certain color ethnicity and like 

894
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,550
you're,
you know,

895
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,590
doing some slippery work,
man,

896
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,870
you know that it gets real weird when 
you start doing that.

897
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:10,590
Yeah,
I,

898
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:11,423
it's all about leveling the outcomes of 
people and yet I think there's this 

899
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:17,504
scary,
a Kurt vonnegut short story where if 

900
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:23,180
you're a really smart,
then you'll have to wear headphones that

901
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,340
just beep all the time.
If you're a beautiful,

902
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:28,580
you'll have to wear a mask in the future
if you're strong and you'll have to have

903
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:31,470
all of these weights on you.
You know,

904
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:32,304
it's

905
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,343
sort of getting there.
It's the same sort of ideology and it's 

906
00:44:36,361 --> 00:44:37,240
scary.
Well,

907
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:38,990
life is not fair,
right?

908
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,043
It is just not.
No one wants to hear that and this is 

909
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,690
really the core issue for all of this 
stuff.

910
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,553
Life is not fair.
There are people that are so much 

911
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:50,670
fucking smarter than me when I talked to
them,

912
00:44:50,671 --> 00:44:53,110
I feel like some sort of a monkey,
you know,

913
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,490
just just,
there's no getting around that.

914
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,410
There are people that are so much bigger
than me,

915
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:00,510
but then I stand next to them.
I feel like a child,

916
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,670
you know,
there's just no getting around that,

917
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:06,990
that that's just the way of the world 
and I think the key is,

918
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,913
I mean,
I guess with a company is to try to 

919
00:45:10,201 --> 00:45:11,034
figure out how to manage all of these 
unfair aspects of being a biological 

920
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:18,540
entity and the civilization.

921
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:19,823
And I don't think Google is doing the 
right job by firing you for promoting 

922
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,250
science because that's what you're 
doing.

923
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,233
You know,
I had a friend who actually was 

924
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:31,410
comparing what you did to,
what's that term friend knology when you

925
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,740
study the size of people's heads.
When they got there.

926
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,180
And I was like,
man,

927
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,190
you can't say that.
It's not what he's doing.

928
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,920
He's doing because he's not saying that 
women can't do it.

929
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:42,570
He's not saying they wouldn't be better 
at it.

930
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,583
He's simply using science and citations 
to describe many of the issues that 

931
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:51,990
probably led to people choosing what 
they choose to do for a career.

932
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,000
Right.
But you can't do that,

933
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:54,780
man.
Look,

934
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,620
look at you.
You're here.

935
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:57,510
You're everywhere.
You're talking about this.

936
00:45:58,210 --> 00:45:59,043
Yeah.
I mean hopefully people will start 

937
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:03,750
seeing that at least how much the media 
was misrepresenting it.

938
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,153
Yeah.

939
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,530
Did you feel frustrated by all these 
articles?

940
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,210
I mean,
it's got to be weird to have people call

941
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:12,110
you a white supremacist and a Nazi and.
Yeah,

942
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,103
and they also try to dig up any dirt 
that they can find on my history and 

943
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:20,063
stuff.
Way Back in high school that I might've 

944
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,930
done tomb raider it as war Croft.
He was a girl running big tits.

945
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:29,970
Did they find anything?
Not really.

946
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,403
Damn,
dude.

947
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,540
What if you had like some dark secret?
Yeah.

948
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,380
That's the thing.
Like I could have done some random thing

949
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:40,920
that was bad of course,
but I mean that wouldn't change the fact

950
00:46:40,921 --> 00:46:43,920
that what I wrote wasn't the sexist 
thing.

951
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,453
Right.
If you did something horrible in the 

952
00:46:45,931 --> 00:46:47,610
past,
at least people can go,

953
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,151
oh,
okay,

954
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:48,984
maybe this guy's a bullshit artist,
and he leaned this stuff toward sexism 

955
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:55,350
even though there is some science behind
it.

956
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:56,183
What he wrote was biased,
but I haven't seen a legit criticism of 

957
00:46:58,741 --> 00:47:00,690
the actual work itself.
I really haven't.

958
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:02,490
I've,
I've read a lot of stuff on you,

959
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:03,570
man.
It's a little creepy.

960
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,800
I haven't seen anything that made sense.
Everything that was criticizing,

961
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,140
criticizing you was being really 
dishonest.

962
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,280
Yeah.
It was either just,

963
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,930
Oh yeah,
this is obviously misogynist,

964
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:15,480
or they would attack claims that I 
didn't make.

965
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,710
They were like,
Oh yeah,

966
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,980
we've shown that women are better in 
school and are doing better in math.

967
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:23,101
Yeah.
It's like,

968
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:24,870
okay,
I wasn't talking about that at all.

969
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,540
Yeah.
It does nothing to do with career paths,

970
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:28,853
you know?
Um,

971
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,100
was really fascinating to

972
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:30,933
me that the woman who's the CEO of 
Youtube responded and said it hurt her 

973
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,830
and she read your memo and I'm like,
you're the CEO of Youtube.

974
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:39,664
You won.
You're the winner of winters when it 

975
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:43,780
comes to ut,
like you're the head of tech,

976
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,170
like no one's saying you don't exist 
saying you can't do it.

977
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:49,420
You obviously did it.
You're a fucking running the thing.

978
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,250
This is crazy.
Why did it hurt?

979
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,050
Science hurts.
What hurts?

980
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,153
Like,
look,

981
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,740
there are,
there's,

982
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,550
there's outliers,
right?

983
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,493
There's always going to be interesting 
to find out why straight white males 

984
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,250
choose different career paths.
Like why?

985
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,900
I mean,
there's so much variation.

986
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,370
There's so much.
So many variables.

987
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,850
There's so much difference.
There's people that are um,

988
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,610
you know,
there's women that are mma fighters.

989
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:17,680
Like why?
Why are they doing that?

990
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:18,281
Like,
what is it?

991
00:48:18,281 --> 00:48:19,630
I don't know.
Like there's,

992
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,880
there's women that are race car drivers.
There's like,

993
00:48:21,881 --> 00:48:22,714
there's outliers.
Does that mean that we need a exact 

994
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:28,390
representation of males to females in 
mma?

995
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,740
Well,
that's insane.

996
00:48:29,741 --> 00:48:32,110
That's not going to happen.
For whatever reason.

997
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,780
Is that the state with that Nascar,
it's not going to happen.

998
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:35,763
There's not some implicit bias.
It's keeping women from driving 250 

999
00:48:39,131 --> 00:48:41,410
miles an hour.
I don't know what it is,

1000
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:46,030
but I don't think that's it.
I think there's probably some biological

1001
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:48,940
differences between men and women and 
they vary.

1002
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:49,803
There's a spectrum,

1003
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,390
you know,
for Nascar it's likely,

1004
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:53,720
you know,
risk aversion.

1005
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,930
Yeah.
And some stuff related to that.

1006
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,870
Same with MMA.
Sure.

1007
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,140
Yeah.
I mean I wouldn't want.

1008
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,460
Yeah,
I mean look at it and I want to do it,

1009
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:04,643
you know,
and I know a lot of pretty girls that 

1010
00:49:05,981 --> 00:49:07,570
are doing it.
It's very weird.

1011
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,050
So it's,
look there's people make choices,

1012
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:11,884
you know,
some people choose to get their bodies 

1013
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:14,224
tattooed,
some people choose to do all sorts of 

1014
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:17,740
strange things,
you know,

1015
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:20,680
it's,
I don't know why they do what they do,

1016
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,514
but it's interesting to study them and 
it seems to me that all you were doing 

1017
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:30,030
was talking about your own personal 
frustration with this very narrow minded

1018
00:49:30,131 --> 00:49:31,660
approach to diversity.

1019
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,900
Right.
And you know,

1020
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,200
they never even say what exactly I could
have done differently to not do this.

1021
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,093
And you know,
there was actually a great piece in the 

1022
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:46,100
Atlantic or something that was directed 
at Sundar is like,

1023
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:47,083
okay,
what specific parts of the document 

1024
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:49,753
we're against the code of conduct and 
what parts are free to discuss and what 

1025
00:49:53,181 --> 00:49:54,014
are not.
Because right now you can't discuss 

1026
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:56,840
anything,
you know,

1027
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,830
he just said,
Oh yeah,

1028
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:02,150
this document is invalid.
And so it means that no one can bring up

1029
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:06,200
any of these issues now.
And just they just have to walk on these

1030
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:10,130
really vague eggshells when really if 
they said no,

1031
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:13,790
this specific part is unacceptable and 
everything else is fine,

1032
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:15,283
then at least there will be some wiggle 
room and people would know what the 

1033
00:50:17,991 --> 00:50:19,160
rules are.
But.

1034
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,313
And we see this a lot with Google policy
where they had these like no jerk 

1035
00:50:23,091 --> 00:50:25,170
policies and no jerk.
Yeah.

1036
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:26,370
Like don't be a jerk.
Okay.

1037
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:30,110
And were jerk is totally up to them to 
define.

1038
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:32,300
And so there could be these people that 
just,

1039
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,243
you know,
harassed you based on your white male 

1040
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,880
privilege and you know,
oh you're conservative,

1041
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:40,460
therefore you're evil and that's not 
being a jerk.

1042
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:42,230
But then,
you know,

1043
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:43,064
questioning some of their viewpoints and
the narrative at Google that it's being 

1044
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:48,464
a jerk.

1045
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,290
So white people are open game 
essentially.

1046
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,143
Like if someone is questioning you about
something and you happen to be a white 

1047
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:58,430
person,
they got to get away with far more.

1048
00:50:59,010 --> 00:50:59,843
Yeah.
They try to invoke this a lot too in 

1049
00:51:02,801 --> 00:51:07,680
these programs where you're encouraged 
when you ask a question or something you

1050
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:10,990
say as a white male,
this is what I feel.

1051
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,760
Oh Jesus.
And that.

1052
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,710
I just think that that's really specific
as well.

1053
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,630
White male with a fat Dick and a large 
pornography collection on a hard drive.

1054
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,700
That's how feel like

1055
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,800
what?
No,

1056
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:25,643
I think even mentioning pornography 
would be some sort of microaggression 

1057
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:31,120
and that's a major aggression,
right?

1058
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,190
Sexual harassment.

1059
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,290
Yeah.
You were a.

1060
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,330
They cited that you promoted harmful 
gender stereotypes.

1061
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,080
Right.
So I had to go over it again.

1062
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:41,621
I'm like,
okay,

1063
00:51:41,621 --> 00:51:43,150
let's read this fucking thing one more 
time.

1064
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,693
Like I don't.
I don't think you've promoted any 

1065
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:47,194
stereotypes.
You were talking with citations about 

1066
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:51,243
science and that's,
that's where this whole thing really 

1067
00:51:54,701 --> 00:51:55,534
confused the shit out of me.
What have you had many people like what 

1068
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:00,400
is the,
the,

1069
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,640
has there been like a 50 slash 50 sort 
of reaction,

1070
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,220
like 50 percent of the people were like 
me kind of confused about this and,

1071
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:07,363
and then 50 percent of the people were 
just knee jerk calling you some sort of 

1072
00:52:10,271 --> 00:52:11,800
a sec.
A sexist or a Nazi.

1073
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,753
Yeah.
So at Google they had an internal poll 

1074
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:17,530
with about 800 people and about 40 
percent of people agreed.

1075
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:18,500
And 40 percent.
Yeah.

1076
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,410
Fifty percent disagree with 10 percent 
were neutral.

1077
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,090
Yeah.
Cowards.

1078
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,123
And even the 50 percent,
probably a good percentage of them are 

1079
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:28,560
just being pussies.
It just doesn't.

1080
00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:32,980
It doesn't seem like if you're looking 
at it really objectively,

1081
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,873
you could look that they obviously want 
a result and that result is the maximum 

1082
00:52:40,151 --> 00:52:45,151
amount of diversity.
And I feel like if that's your result,

1083
00:52:45,851 --> 00:52:46,684
if that's what you're looking for,
shouldn't the result be let's not 

1084
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:50,044
discriminate,
just be open and just try to get the 

1085
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:54,940
best people.
Like wouldn't that be the best way to do

1086
00:52:54,941 --> 00:52:56,590
it?
And then if we run into problems like,

1087
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,573
you know,
we've tried to do this best people 

1088
00:52:58,211 --> 00:53:00,220
thing,
but all we have as Asians,

1089
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,233
so,
uh,

1090
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:01,880
yeah.

1091
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,440
So even suggesting that we should go to 
selling meritocracy thing.

1092
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,470
That's a microaggression.
Meritocracy is a microaggression.

1093
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1094
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,173
So what's the argument for that?
Like why is meritocracy a 

1095
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,224
microaggression?
Because it will make some people feel 

1096
00:53:18,981 --> 00:53:23,220
unwelcome because they have to perform.
I really,

1097
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:24,763
it's basically just anything against the
last ideology is a microaggression in 

1098
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:30,144
some ways.
So anything that could make anyone feel 

1099
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:36,120
offended,
particularly people in certain groups.

1100
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,050
Man,
that's an liberal for a long time.

1101
00:53:39,051 --> 00:53:39,884
And I've never seen it this bad before.
You don't know what happened when it 

1102
00:53:43,881 --> 00:53:44,714
happened.
So slippery it seems like within the 

1103
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:49,100
last 10 years,
right?

1104
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,093
Yeah.
I think the Internet has celebrated a 

1105
00:53:51,481 --> 00:53:52,314
lot of this where there can be these 
online mobs that enforced these social 

1106
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:59,000
rules,
but I,

1107
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:02,700
I think at least now some people can see
it for what it is.

1108
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:03,460
Well,
I think

1109
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,293
what you're seeing is that there's a 
fear of retribution and that's one of 

1110
00:54:08,501 --> 00:54:09,334
the reasons why people are towing the 
line is that they're worried about 

1111
00:54:11,801 --> 00:54:12,634
these,
like hyper aggressive people that are 

1112
00:54:13,811 --> 00:54:17,650
coming out against people that don't toe
the line there,

1113
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:18,603
you know,
like you're saying shaming you and that 

1114
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:21,693
that is,
that's a disturbing aspect of human 

1115
00:54:24,191 --> 00:54:27,310
nature that I don't think she'd ever be 
reinforced.

1116
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:28,100
And,
and,

1117
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,933
and I think it's hard to call those 
things out individually because of 

1118
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:33,813
collectively as a group,
if this group of diversity minded folks 

1119
00:54:37,601 --> 00:54:41,050
left wing minded social justice warrior 
types are attacking you,

1120
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,020
you feel very isolated and there's not a
lot of support,

1121
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,413
you know?
And so most people just acquiesced they 

1122
00:54:47,291 --> 00:54:49,180
just back off,
they just give in,

1123
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,163
they toe the line,
they alter their thoughts or they keep 

1124
00:54:53,801 --> 00:54:54,634
it to themselves.

1125
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,600
Yeah.
And I mean I think shaming does have its

1126
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:00,660
benefits it and when we were in small 
groups,

1127
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:03,570
you know,
if someone stole something or was mean,

1128
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:04,703
Dan actually shaming them as good.
But you're talking about tribal groups 

1129
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,003
in the past.
Yeah.

1130
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,220
But now that anyone across the world can
just randomly shame you and attack you,

1131
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,430
that does not really what our brain was 
meant for and just,

1132
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:20,383
you know,
even me seeing just random messages 

1133
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,100
telling me that I'm some horrible person
that,

1134
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,073
you know,
that hurts me even though I have gotten 

1135
00:55:29,281 --> 00:55:31,890
a lot of actual private messages saying,
yeah,

1136
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:34,230
we support you.
You're not alone,

1137
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,470
but I have to keep my mouth shut.
I don't want to get fired from Yahoo.

1138
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,530
Right.
I've met with so many people and they're

1139
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:42,240
like.
And of course,

1140
00:55:42,241 --> 00:55:44,670
you know,
don't tell anyone that you.

1141
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:45,953
That's so weird.
Now you obviously we're not a public 

1142
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:49,710
person,
right?

1143
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,490
You were a guy just was working.
What is your job at Google?

1144
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,573
A software engineer.
I was working on the indexing and 

1145
00:55:56,911 --> 00:55:58,560
serving of a search.

1146
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,550
So to go from that,
which is,

1147
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:05,580
I'm like you,
you describe yourself as an introvert,

1148
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:06,583
right?
And to go from that to this massive 

1149
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:14,121
exposure and to be the essentially the 
lightning rod for a real hot topic.

1150
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,880
I mean this is one of the most hot 
button topics you can get.

1151
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,300
Men versus women in tech are men and 
women in tech,

1152
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:22,740
women,
diversity,

1153
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:24,400
white people,
black people,

1154
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:27,800
racism.
Nazis who you're,

1155
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,310
you're at the tip of the spear buddy.

1156
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:31,543
Yeah,
and I'm really afraid that I'm actually 

1157
00:56:33,361 --> 00:56:38,361
just polarizing issue even more and 
separating people and because you know,

1158
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,773
it's really shown that there are the 
stereotypes are real and some ways that 

1159
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:46,853
there are some really extreme people on 
the left and really extreme people in 

1160
00:56:49,591 --> 00:56:54,270
the right maybe and you know,
we really need to bridge it and say,

1161
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:57,540
okay,
let's actually have a discussion,

1162
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:58,403
let's talk about what's actually 
happening and nothing is really off the 

1163
00:57:01,801 --> 00:57:04,920
table in this discussion,
but that's not happening.

1164
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,800
And Google itself,
from what I've heard,

1165
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:08,873
they've just been doubling down on the 
diversity stuff and they haven't 

1166
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,050
addressed any of the political 
discrimination.

1167
00:57:13,370 --> 00:57:14,203
Wow.
Well I think you're right and I think 

1168
00:57:15,741 --> 00:57:16,574
that's.
That has to be your motivation for 

1169
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,850
writing that thing.
I mean,

1170
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:20,863
that was a very well thought out memo 
and I don't think someone who wanted to 

1171
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:29,503
separate people would have written that 
the way it seemed to me as an outsider 

1172
00:57:33,861 --> 00:57:36,680
with no dog in the fight.
I was looking.

1173
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:37,071
I was like,
Oh,

1174
00:57:37,071 --> 00:57:40,610
this guy is probably like frustrated at 
what he sees,

1175
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,473
these sort of social justice warrior 
tactics and these aren't logical and 

1176
00:57:44,751 --> 00:57:45,584
that this is not rational,
and like maybe my breakdown of this 

1177
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:51,874
situation scientifically evolutionary 
psychology studies and all these 

1178
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,054
different random factors that may have 
contributed to women choosing these 

1179
00:57:59,691 --> 00:58:02,120
careers.
Maybe this will help ease off.

1180
00:58:02,121 --> 00:58:03,560
Maybe people aren't aware of this 
information.

1181
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:05,260
Yeah.
Yeah.

1182
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:06,613
I definitely have a bias where I thought
we could just sit down and discuss it 

1183
00:58:09,441 --> 00:58:10,274
rationally.
That's all I ever wanted was sit down 

1184
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,780
and discuss it with them.
Yeah.

1185
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:14,773
But I really underestimated the sort of 
group based emotions that were behind 

1186
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:22,100
this and that's scary.

1187
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:23,640
Yeah.
Well,

1188
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:25,770
you know,
they're fucking.

1189
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,620
One of the things that was important 
about Charlotte,

1190
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:33,830
I think Charlottesville rather,
is that we got to see real Nazis,

1191
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:35,281
right?
Like,

1192
00:58:35,281 --> 00:58:36,420
hey man,
they're real.

1193
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,060
It's not the fucking guy,
right in the Google memo,

1194
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:43,980
it's this asshole with a swastika on his
chest is carry a Tiki torch walking down

1195
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:45,870
the street with a gun in his pocket.
You know,

1196
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,063
ranting about the Jews and black people.
That's a real Nazi and that is what you 

1197
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:53,904
were saying.
There's extreme people on the right and 

1198
00:58:55,801 --> 00:58:58,580
there's extreme people on the left and 
they they.

1199
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:03,590
They don't understand that they are way 
more similar than they like to believe.

1200
00:59:03,871 --> 00:59:05,670
If you believe that all white people are
racist,

1201
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:06,773
if you believe that is an MPO is 
impossible for you to be a white person 

1202
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,333
and not have some implicit bias and 
racism and that it's impossible to be 

1203
00:59:15,841 --> 00:59:16,674
racist against white people because 
racism is about using power and 

1204
00:59:19,981 --> 00:59:22,850
influence and minorities do not have 
power and influence,

1205
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,070
so they can be prejudice,
but they cannot be racist.

1206
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,260
Well,
you're just as bad as the fucking person

1207
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:29,600
with the Tiki torch.
You don't think you are.

1208
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,853
I know you don't think you are,
but you want because you're just as 

1209
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:35,900
ridiculous.
You're so off of what is real.

1210
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,913
You're so off.
You know the idea that all black people 

1211
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:39,794
responsible for the woes of society and 
that none of it has to do with the fact 

1212
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:46,010
that were captured hundreds of years ago
and brought over here as slaves and that

1213
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,160
there there are lesser as human beings.
That's a disgusting,

1214
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:52,940
ridiculous proposition and the people 
that think that way are fools,

1215
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,560
right?
And that rightly so,

1216
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:58,130
most people in the center look at those 
as fools.

1217
00:59:59,000 --> 00:59:59,833
I look at the people that think that you
can't be racist against white people as 

1218
01:00:03,561 --> 01:00:04,394
just as foolish.
You dumb fucks are fueling these 

1219
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:07,454
assholes like with this dumb way of 
looking at things and pushing these 

1220
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,670
ridiculous ideas that all white people 
are racist.

1221
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,170
You're supposed to feel bad because 
you're white.

1222
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,450
I didn't do anything.
Didn't do anything,

1223
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:19,940
didn't ask to be born white,
didn't ask to be born male.

1224
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,270
Okay?
Like you can't get mad at people for who

1225
01:00:23,271 --> 01:00:25,640
they are.
You should.

1226
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:30,670
We should be having an open discussion 
about what is wrong,

1227
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:32,540
like what's wrong?
Like how,

1228
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:33,374
what,
what,

1229
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,200
what is going wrong?
Why is this happening?

1230
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,153
Why are these negative things happening?
Not why don't we have more women or why 

1231
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,700
don't we have more Indian men are.
Why don't we.

1232
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:44,534
I mean,
that's,

1233
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:47,330
that's fucking ridiculous.
It's ridiculous.

1234
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:49,770
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1235
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,050
And I didn't.
The two sides are just scapegoating,

1236
01:00:52,051 --> 01:00:56,880
so it is very similar and not taking any
personal responsibility.

1237
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:58,531
At least,
you know,

1238
01:00:58,531 --> 01:01:00,350
what Jordan Peterson would say is just,
you know,

1239
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,210
fix yourself before trying to fix the 
ills of the world.

1240
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,533
Well,
I mean I think there's also an issue 

1241
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:07,774
here is that I don't,
I've got to be very careful with my 

1242
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:11,164
words,
but I feel like this is a game and I 

1243
01:01:13,991 --> 01:01:15,730
don't mean it's a game.
Like there's not,

1244
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,230
it's not a real issue.
This app,

1245
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:21,220
it's absolutely a real issue,
but I think people play for points and I

1246
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:22,054
think that there's a real issue when 
people do things for Social Brownie 

1247
01:01:25,241 --> 01:01:25,990
points,
right?

1248
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:26,823
Like Google saying that you were fired 
for promoting unfair gender stereotypes 

1249
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:36,190
or dangerous or what was the word that 
they use?

1250
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,450
Harmful,
harmful,

1251
01:01:37,451 --> 01:01:42,130
harmful gender stereotypes.
That is a fucking play.

1252
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,950
That's a play for points.
One hundred percent.

1253
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,873
Okay.
Where are the fucking harmful gender 

1254
01:01:47,201 --> 01:01:49,180
stereotypes?
Where are they promoted?

1255
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,103
You tell me how.
If you don't tell me how I want a 

1256
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:52,264
fucking apology because you're lying.
You're lying because you want all those 

1257
01:01:55,991 --> 01:01:57,340
people on the left.
It calmed down.

1258
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,330
Well,
we fired him.

1259
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,300
I fired him a month after you.
You knew he wrote that Shit.

1260
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,433
Are you guys crazy?
Did you go over the science before you 

1261
01:02:04,181 --> 01:02:05,014
fire them or.
No.

1262
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,460
Like what did you,
what did you do?

1263
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,543
Like where's the,
where's the harmful gender stereotypes 

1264
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:09,904
you guys talked about?

1265
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,200
Yeah,
and I,

1266
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:16,240
it sucks too because you really need to 
address some of these things if you want

1267
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:19,140
to address the gender gap.
And yeah,

1268
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:23,070
that was what page of my thing was all 
about was oh,

1269
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:23,904
you know,
if women are more cooperative and they 

1270
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:27,773
approach the workplace differently than 
maybe we can change our workplace to be 

1271
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,463
more approachable.
But if they're not willing to 

1272
01:02:32,671 --> 01:02:35,530
acknowledge any of these differences 
then you know,

1273
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:39,180
they won't do anything.
So it's really annoying.

1274
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,233
Well,
any interpersonal relationships with 

1275
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,400
random people can be messy.
You know,

1276
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:46,520
you get a group of 30 people together,
you force them to work in a building and

1277
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:48,920
it's going to be messy to where people 
are messy.

1278
01:02:48,921 --> 01:02:50,270
We're weird,
you know,

1279
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:53,570
and if you have more of one group than 
another,

1280
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:55,100
that groves is going to fail.
It alienated.

1281
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:57,470
So if you have 80 percent men,
20 percent women,

1282
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,870
they're going to feel alienated.
There's no way around it.

1283
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:05,380
But the right way of approaching it is 
not to distort the facts,

1284
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,350
especially when you're thought of as 
being.

1285
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:14,510
I mean Google is essentially a pillar of
information.

1286
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,450
I mean they're one of the most important
like hey man,

1287
01:03:17,451 --> 01:03:19,940
google it.
I mean that is the thing that people say

1288
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,700
they're one of the most important 
aspects of our society today.

1289
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,253
Having the ability to instant nobody 
says go bing that nobody gives a shit 

1290
01:03:28,731 --> 01:03:29,660
about being right.

1291
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,800
I mean as a joke,
but Google is hugely important.

1292
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,540
So if you are essentially in charge of 
the distribution,

1293
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:43,490
have more knowledge than arguably 
anything else on earth.

1294
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,710
Maybe that's a big statement,
but I think.

1295
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:46,783
I think you might be able to.
You might be able to actually say that 

1296
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,220
and be empty.
Pretty honest.

1297
01:03:52,221 --> 01:03:53,054
I think Google is responsible for 
distributing more information than any 

1298
01:03:58,071 --> 01:04:01,430
group on earth.
That's a giant responsibility.

1299
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:05,480
That responsibility.
You cannot say that someone is promoting

1300
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:09,050
harmful gender stereotypes when they're 
absolutely not,

1301
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:10,580
because I'm going over this fucking 
thing.

1302
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,110
I'm pulling pages out.
I'm like,

1303
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,680
where's the harmful gender stereotypes 
other than the word neuroticism.

1304
01:04:15,681 --> 01:04:16,514
I just don't.
If you got fired for the word 

1305
01:04:18,171 --> 01:04:19,004
neuroticism,
well why is that word in all of these 

1306
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,890
evolutionary psychology texts?
Like what?

1307
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,760
What's going on?

1308
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:27,813
Yeah,
and if you just google personality 

1309
01:04:29,141 --> 01:04:31,000
differences between men and women or 
something,

1310
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,000
then that'll be the first five results.
So it's.

1311
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:35,103
Yeah,

1312
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:38,060
and obviously these are just some of 
them.

1313
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,410
I mean there's a broad.
Again,

1314
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:42,110
there's a broad spectrum of human beings
and both genders,

1315
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:44,390
right?
Who are you suing them?

1316
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:48,280
Yeah,
exploring all legal remedies.

1317
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:50,020
That's.
Have they contacted you and go,

1318
01:04:50,021 --> 01:04:50,854
listen,

1319
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:55,400
James will have to be so crazy.
James relaxed.

1320
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,850
Let's go to dinner.
Let's have some falafel.

1321
01:04:59,140 --> 01:04:59,973
I am surprised that they never know when
they fired me had me try to sign 

1322
01:05:03,131 --> 01:05:05,470
something to say,
Oh yeah,

1323
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:09,160
you know,
just here's some nondisclosure agreement

1324
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:10,980
or something and then just pay you off.
Yeah.

1325
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,230
But that was a big fuck up on their 
part.

1326
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:15,770
It seems like it.
Well,

1327
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,100
I think they feel like they're 
completely.

1328
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:22,390
I feel like the game again is like super
clear.

1329
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:23,380
Like oh no,
we just,

1330
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,170
we sunk a three pointer in.
It's no problem.

1331
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:28,360
Like this is pretty.
This is pretty straightforward.

1332
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,210
One of the net dude,
we don't have to do shit.

1333
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,250
You have to pay him because he lost the 
point,

1334
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,413
you know,
and I think maybe they underestimated 

1335
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:37,114
how much negative press there would be 
about this because a lot of the initial 

1336
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:41,014
stuff was all negative because it was 
coming out of the people that were 

1337
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:47,530
tweeting about it and then they saw 
that,

1338
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,423
oh yeah,
the,

1339
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,760
it's really not this one sided and you 
know,

1340
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,720
a lot of the things that may happen in a
case as you know,

1341
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:59,140
there's a lot of discovery into what the
internals of Google are happening.

1342
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,730
I don't think they want that to happen 
because you will actually see that,

1343
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,623
Oh yes,
maybe there was this illegal 

1344
01:06:05,621 --> 01:06:06,790
discrimination happening.

1345
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:10,390
Now what is illegal about the 
discrimination that they're employing?

1346
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:14,230
So I didn't and I'm not a lawyer,
so I can't say,

1347
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:17,680
but at least according to our own 
policies we said,

1348
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:18,963
you know,
it's illegal to use someone's protected 

1349
01:06:20,921 --> 01:06:21,754
status,
so their sex or gender or sex or race 

1350
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,130
and employment,
critical situations like,

1351
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:28,840
you know,
when they're getting hired,

1352
01:06:28,841 --> 01:06:29,674
when they're trying to be matched to a 
manager or to a team and when we're 

1353
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:37,030
choosing who to promote and.
But it,

1354
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,670
it is happening in a lot of these 
places.

1355
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,160
Protected status.
Yeah.

1356
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,860
That's how they refer to it internally.
Or is that like a common phrase?

1357
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:49,120
I think that's a common phrase.
Well protected step.

1358
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:51,700
What's protected about like,
yeah,

1359
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:52,534
you're not supposed to be able to 
discriminate on based on someone's age 

1360
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:58,720
or you know,
I mean it's mostly,

1361
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:00,040
it was originally like,
oh yeah,

1362
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:01,750
you shouldn't be discriminated against 
black people,

1363
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,930
but obviously,
I mean it should apply to everyone.

1364
01:07:04,990 --> 01:07:09,990
Right?
So by doing that,

1365
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:13,150
they violated their own rules.
Right.

1366
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,033
But they don't think about it that way 
because they're promoting diversity by 

1367
01:07:18,731 --> 01:07:19,564
doing that.
Yet it's kind of weird how they cited 

1368
01:07:22,601 --> 01:07:25,750
some of the same parts of the code of 
conduct where.

1369
01:07:26,080 --> 01:07:28,450
Oh yes,
every employee should do their utmost of

1370
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:32,950
reducing bias and harassment and illegal
discrimination.

1371
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,053
When really my document was about 
eliminating the bias against 

1372
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:37,954
conservatives and the harassment against
them and the legal discrimination that 

1373
01:07:41,621 --> 01:07:43,600
we're doing in multiple parts of our 
pipeline.

1374
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,550
There's no room for conservatives today 
or.

1375
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:51,160
I mean I'm.
Are you conservative?

1376
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:54,010
Do you feel like you can tell I'm pretty
much just libertarian,

1377
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:56,680
but that's thought of as conservative 
because it's convenient.

1378
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,670
You just immediately pushed off.
Yeah.

1379
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:01,630
That right wing,
angry white male group.

1380
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,390
Everyone that's in the center or right 
of that is alright.

1381
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:07,560
Alright.
Yeah,

1382
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,920
it's pretty.
You favor of smaller government,

1383
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:14,300
less intrusion.
Yeah.

1384
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,250
I'm not super libertarian.

1385
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,030
Like I obviously believe that there's 
places where the government should be,

1386
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,493
but just my,
my like internal leaning or in 

1387
01:08:24,891 --> 01:08:26,210
philosophy is more like the.

1388
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:27,483
Yeah,
I think socially I lean more left like 

1389
01:08:29,441 --> 01:08:33,730
socially,
like in terms of like welfare and things

1390
01:08:33,731 --> 01:08:34,564
along those lines and you know,
obviously this protected status is 

1391
01:08:38,801 --> 01:08:39,820
driving me crazy.
This,

1392
01:08:39,821 --> 01:08:42,020
this thing that trump's doing with um,
uh,

1393
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:43,203
children that were born in this country 
are born in other countries and then 

1394
01:08:45,881 --> 01:08:48,430
brought over here as children and then 
they're talking about deporting them.

1395
01:08:48,550 --> 01:08:49,383
That drives me fucking crazy.
The hard right version of that is 

1396
01:08:52,301 --> 01:08:53,230
despicable.
This,

1397
01:08:53,231 --> 01:08:56,320
these people that I see online with,
why didn't they apply for citizenship?

1398
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,281
Oh,
who knows?

1399
01:08:57,281 --> 01:08:59,360
Maybe because they're fucking 13,
you know,

1400
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:02,830
like will you out there applying for 
citizenship if you were 13?

1401
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:03,903
No,
I mean when you're 13 years old you're 

1402
01:09:04,631 --> 01:09:05,464
playing games and hanging out with your 
friends and then you find out you were 

1403
01:09:07,451 --> 01:09:09,040
born in Guatemala and you're like,
what?

1404
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:11,080
Like you have to go back to Guatemala.

1405
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:12,040
What?
Yeah,

1406
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:13,383
it's crazy sex.
I lean way left when it comes to those 

1407
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:19,690
kinds of things.
Gay Rights and things like,

1408
01:09:19,691 --> 01:09:21,400
um,
you know,

1409
01:09:21,401 --> 01:09:22,234
uh,
social programs for disenfranchised 

1410
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:24,724
people and disenfranchised communities.
I leaned way like if I want my tax 

1411
01:09:27,581 --> 01:09:29,440
dollars to go to anything I wanted to go
to,

1412
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:30,274
making people's lives easier,
whether it's socialized medicine or 

1413
01:09:33,581 --> 01:09:37,360
whatever,
whatever we could do to make people have

1414
01:09:37,361 --> 01:09:38,194
an easier path to success and to not 
have them so burdened down by their 

1415
01:09:42,671 --> 01:09:43,504
environment and their circumstances.
That I think is like our responsibility 

1416
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:48,334
as human beings to try to,
I don't want to say even the playing 

1417
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:52,750
field because there's never going to be 
an even playing field,

1418
01:09:52,751 --> 01:09:55,660
but to give people opportunity,
that's it.

1419
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:57,370
Just give people an opportunity to do 
well,

1420
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,010
not have it so completely stacked 
against them.

1421
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:03,820
So in that sense,
I'm not very conservative in that way.

1422
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:04,683
Like I'm not one of those pull yourself 
up by your bootstraps that because 

1423
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:08,640
that's just,
that's so delusional.

1424
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:10,510
Like some people are just fucked,
you know,

1425
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,250
they,
they,

1426
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:12,083
they're born with a terrible hand and it
would be nice if more of us were 

1427
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:18,580
charitable in that regard.
You know?

1428
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:19,414
And some people think that that charity 
should be a personal issue and that we 

1429
01:10:22,421 --> 01:10:23,700
should all just do it,
you know,

1430
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,510
as part of our community and our 
society.

1431
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,880
Maybe that's a good argument.
And,

1432
01:10:27,881 --> 01:10:28,714
but maybe the argument is that our 
government should be a part of our 

1433
01:10:31,451 --> 01:10:32,570
community,
you know,

1434
01:10:32,571 --> 01:10:34,600
and that we should think about it that 
way instead of thinking of it as,

1435
01:10:34,601 --> 01:10:35,434
as,
as this overlord that decides and 

1436
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:38,434
designates where our money should go,
that maybe we should have some more say 

1437
01:10:40,881 --> 01:10:42,330
in it,
it should be some sort of a,

1438
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:43,980
a more,
um,

1439
01:10:44,890 --> 01:10:45,723
you know,
just,

1440
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,290
just a,
a more,

1441
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,720
uh,
more kind approach.

1442
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:52,660
So in that sense,
I leaned pretty far left,

1443
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:55,750
but I'm also pretty pragmatic,
you know,

1444
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:56,603
and I,
and I also know that if you give people 

1445
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:01,660
too much,
it's sort of that winning lottery ticket

1446
01:11:01,661 --> 01:11:06,010
thing or that you know,
that if you,

1447
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:09,910
if you make things too easy for people,
they don't try hard.

1448
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,400
It's just a natural part of human 
nature.

1449
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,070
So in that sense,
some conservative

1450
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,450
and a lot of ways,
yeah,

1451
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,403
you definitely need some sort of safety 
net and to ensure that people can 

1452
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:20,730
actually achieve the American dream.

1453
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:24,620
Well just be healthy,
make our live and bleeding more and more

1454
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:27,560
towards the universal basic income than 
anything.

1455
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:30,860
I think universal basic income at a 
certain point to elegant enough that you

1456
01:11:30,861 --> 01:11:31,694
can just eat and survive and then maybe 
that would open up a lot more people to 

1457
01:11:35,781 --> 01:11:38,370
pursuing dreams to going after things.
I mean,

1458
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,730
I don't know.
I mean there's arguments for and against

1459
01:11:40,970 --> 01:11:41,803
and I think it's debatable.
It will be interesting to see know 

1460
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,253
Finland I think was proposing to start 
this because we don't really know what 

1461
01:11:49,521 --> 01:11:50,440
will happen.
Right?

1462
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:55,250
And maybe people will start doing their 
hobbies and really find their passion.

1463
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:58,130
Maybe they'll just sit at home and watch
TV and die.

1464
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,360
Yeah,
I,

1465
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:00,393
it's really.
These are the problems that we as a 

1466
01:12:02,661 --> 01:12:05,900
society will have to overcome.
And you know,

1467
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,120
of course these are just first world 
problems,

1468
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:10,910
but that's,
that will be what the world is like.

1469
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,910
There was another country today.
I read about it on Google a,

1470
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:19,460
another country today that's considering
universal basic income.

1471
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,660
Fucking was it South Korea?
Oh really?

1472
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:26,003
Um,

1473
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:29,780
see if he could find it.
It's in Scotland.

1474
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:30,723
Is that what it was?

1475
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:32,683
Oh,

1476
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,440
I think there's many,
many people that are.

1477
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:38,333
I mean,
Elon Musk has been promoting this 

1478
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:40,373
lately.
Scotland will begin funding universal 

1479
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:43,320
basic income experiments.
Yeah,

1480
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:44,700
Hawaii,
that's what it was.

1481
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,840
Hawaii considers universal basic income 
as robot scene,

1482
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:49,674
stealing jobs.
Fucking robots running around the 

1483
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:51,750
streets.
Stealing jobs.

1484
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:53,430
Yeah.
It's Hawaii

1485
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,070
I think are,

1486
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,070
is,
uh,

1487
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,290
some real arguments to be made.
And I think,

1488
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:01,124
um,
Elon musk who is of course a part of 

1489
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:07,970
this automated a car revolution and 
he's,

1490
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:09,350
uh,
he's creating these,

1491
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:10,603
these trucks that they're gonna start 
using to haul things and they're going 

1492
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:15,414
to be automated and it's going to remove
a lot of jobs and they're starting to 

1493
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,390
talk about universal basic income as you
know,

1494
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:22,640
a real solution to that mean

1495
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,590
it's entirely possible.
It's certainly an argument,

1496
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,570
you know,
it's certainly worth discussing yet,

1497
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:30,933
something like that.
And hopefully the incentives will be 

1498
01:13:32,771 --> 01:13:36,550
better than some of the current welfare 
systems where you know,

1499
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,620
you're not incentivized to get off of 
it.

1500
01:13:38,740 --> 01:13:39,573
Yeah.
If you start working then you'll lose 

1501
01:13:40,601 --> 01:13:41,434
all of it while universal basic income 
can be made such that you start working 

1502
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:46,894
and then you'll lose a little bit.
But it's never an actual incentive to 

1503
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:52,210
not work.
Yes.

1504
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:53,890
Right.
It's not an incentive to not work,

1505
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:54,993
but it's an,

1506
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:59,170
it gives you food and shelter.
Right.

1507
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,280
So then you could go pursue a dream,
which I think it would be wonderful.

1508
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:02,761
I mean,
look,

1509
01:14:02,761 --> 01:14:06,390
if there's anything that our tax dollars
should be going towards,

1510
01:14:06,690 --> 01:14:07,523
it's creating less losers,
less people who feel disenfranchised by 

1511
01:14:10,951 --> 01:14:12,010
the system.
You

1512
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,670
know,
if you're,

1513
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:13,503
if you're,
if you can pay x amount of tax dollars 

1514
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:21,040
but live in an exponentially more safe 
and friendly and happy environment.

1515
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,130
I think most people would be leaning 
towards that.

1516
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:23,993
I think it would

1517
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:25,410
because.
Yeah,

1518
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:26,830
I mean,
and we'll see this.

1519
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:27,940
We see us too.
And um,

1520
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:32,680
people that start companies where as a 
huge risk to start a company,

1521
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:36,700
most people fail.
And most entrepreneurs in silicon valley

1522
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:41,440
are men who are much more willing to 
take risks,

1523
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:42,423
but if we do have some sort of strong 
safety net then it won't be so bad if 

1524
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:47,524
you fail.
And maybe that'll help address some of 

1525
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:50,710
the gender gap too.

1526
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:52,840
That's interesting.
You know,

1527
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,463
it's,
we want women to succeed in these 

1528
01:14:58,501 --> 01:15:03,501
positions so badly that like a woman ceo
can become like a superstar.

1529
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:09,990
Like that lady from that blood testing 
company that turned out to be bullshit.

1530
01:15:10,230 --> 01:15:12,120
Was that Thanos?
Is that the name of it?

1531
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:13,261
There are.
No,

1532
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:15,630
sir.
That was a fascinating case.

1533
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,613
This woman essentially was role playing 
as a female steve jobs with a bullshit 

1534
01:15:21,901 --> 01:15:26,901
product that didn't really do what it 
was advertised to do and her company was

1535
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,433
valued at something like 30 something 
billion dollars and she was thought to 

1536
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,560
be the richest self made woman in the 
world.

1537
01:15:34,561 --> 01:15:35,394
And then almost overnight she's worth 
nothing because they found out it 

1538
01:15:38,941 --> 01:15:41,610
doesn't work.
And the company sort of fell apart.

1539
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:44,820
There it is.
How Elizabeth Holmes House of cards game

1540
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:45,773
came tumbling town.
It is a fascinating story because this 

1541
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:49,074
woman look at her,
they're dressed the part put on a 

1542
01:15:51,271 --> 01:15:52,380
fucking black turtleneck.

1543
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,030
I mean,
she dressed like Steve Jobs.

1544
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:55,170
I remember,
um,

1545
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:56,003
she gave this speech once at some 
woman's for women's success group for 

1546
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:02,330
something or another.
And uh,

1547
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:06,990
she got up there and in this like 
unprepared rambling,

1548
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:11,490
stupid speech and I was like,
how is this woman this super genius?

1549
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:13,020
Well,
it turns out she wasn't,

1550
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:13,883
you know,
she dropped out of college at Nineteen 

1551
01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:16,470
and,
and created this company.

1552
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:19,050
She started this when she was in 
college,

1553
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:20,363
you know,
and she,

1554
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,980
she basically just fit what people were 
looking for,

1555
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:23,950
you know,
and,

1556
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:28,900
and bullshitted away to billions almost,
you know,

1557
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,150
to kind of crazy.

1558
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:32,293
Yeah.
A lot of people are very willing to see 

1559
01:16:34,331 --> 01:16:36,490
that whatever narrative they want.
Yeah.

1560
01:16:37,050 --> 01:16:37,883
And I,
and we see this all the time in the 

1561
01:16:38,921 --> 01:16:39,754
media too,
where they just fit the data however 

1562
01:16:42,881 --> 01:16:43,520
they want.

1563
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:44,353
Right.
Which is why they wanted to call you a 

1564
01:16:45,171 --> 01:16:46,440
misogynist.
Yeah.

1565
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:47,930
When I,
when I first read that,

1566
01:16:47,931 --> 01:16:49,070
I was like,
wow.

1567
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:50,600
Like uh,
this is a,

1568
01:16:50,601 --> 01:16:54,380
this is a hot take by this lady who.
Sure.

1569
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:55,223
The article,
I think she wrote one of them was a let 

1570
01:16:57,501 --> 01:17:01,220
me lady explain what's going on with 
women in tech.

1571
01:17:01,310 --> 01:17:02,730
Did you read that one?
I saw.

1572
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,910
I don't remember.
There's so many.

1573
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:06,740
Yeah,
there's a lot of it,

1574
01:17:06,741 --> 01:17:07,940
dude.
There's a lot of it.

1575
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,950
So where are you right now?
I mean,

1576
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:10,070
do

1577
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:11,510
you,
you obviously,

1578
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:15,020
did they give you some sort of a,
a pension or something like that?

1579
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:16,430
They didn't have any money.
They just fire you

1580
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,553
now.
I,

1581
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,433
yeah,
I've been cheap throughout the years 

1582
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,750
though.
So he saved up some cash.

1583
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,960
That's good.
Still trying to figure out what's next.

1584
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,823
Have you got any job offers?
I've gotten random job offers from 

1585
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,630
people but I haven't.
Alright.

1586
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:36,380
It's hard to tell how serious they are.
If you thought about writing a book yet.

1587
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:40,370
I have not seen much of a writer.
So you wrote that memo pretty well?

1588
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,980
Yeah,
I mean I'm famous for what I wrote,

1589
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:45,530
but I'm not,
it's,

1590
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,453
you know,
if I had been studying how to write and 

1591
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:50,690
stuff my entire life,
I wouldn't have been an engineer,

1592
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,000
but we did a great job with it though.
Yeah,

1593
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,140
I mean it was very thorough.
I like to think so.

1594
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:58,400
I,
it,

1595
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:03,020
it addressed a lot of things and it's 
unfortunate that there was that one part

1596
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:03,913
that is getting so much attention when 
really it pointed out a lot of problems 

1597
01:18:07,941 --> 01:18:08,774
in our culture and a lot of suggestions 
for how to fix things and it seems like 

1598
01:18:12,740 --> 01:18:15,650
none of that is really gaining traction.
Yeah,

1599
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:18,650
no,
well it least,

1600
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,230
it started the conversation,
right?

1601
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:24,170
Not at least for you because you got 
fired.

1602
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:26,423
I mean in some ways though,
it has made it even more dangerous to 

1603
01:18:29,511 --> 01:18:31,040
bring these up.
At least,

1604
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:35,600
you know,
it's sort of empowered some people to at

1605
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:36,434
least understand some of the issues and 
hopefully these things will get brought 

1606
01:18:40,881 --> 01:18:43,430
up.
But right now it's sort of a toxic,

1607
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,640
a tough topic to bring up at Google at 
least.

1608
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,770
Do you think that it's toxic in,

1609
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,013
in the short term,
but in the long term it'll inspire a 

1610
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:54,994
more reasoned,
balanced conversation once the dust has 

1611
01:18:57,221 --> 01:18:58,054
settled,

1612
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,350
hopefully.
And you know,

1613
01:18:59,351 --> 01:19:04,351
that's sort of one of the hopes with the
lawsuit is to show people that no,

1614
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:05,373
Google can't just do this,
that there are limits to how much they 

1615
01:19:07,361 --> 01:19:09,070
can silence things.
Yeah.

1616
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:13,570
And you shouldn't be afraid to point out
issues in the workplace.

1617
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:15,103
Right.
And you just said with the lawsuit like 

1618
01:19:16,751 --> 01:19:21,751
it's absolutely happening.
Yeah,

1619
01:19:21,821 --> 01:19:22,654
I believe we filed a claim with the nlrb
which is the national labor relations 

1620
01:19:25,991 --> 01:19:27,040
board.
Uh,

1621
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,850
and so they usually work with unions and
you know,

1622
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,733
it's often employers that try to break 
up unions and fire people for joining 

1623
01:19:35,111 --> 01:19:38,290
unions.
And that's illegal and you know,

1624
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:39,124
a lot of this,
what I was doing was a conservative 

1625
01:19:41,590 --> 01:19:44,560
effort between multiple people that,
you know,

1626
01:19:44,561 --> 01:19:45,394
trying to improve the workplace and 
actually know whistle blow on some of 

1627
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:52,330
the illegal practices.

1628
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:53,233
Did you save emails where people were 
shaming people for being white or 

1629
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:57,434
shaming people for having implicit bias 
because there were white or harassing 

1630
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:01,970
people for

1631
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,870
yet a lot of people have been doing 
this,

1632
01:20:04,871 --> 01:20:05,704
like there's some efforts within google 
to at least document some of this 

1633
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,150
because while they may not be the 
majority,

1634
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:18,240
they,
they're sort of a silent,

1635
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:22,260
a coalition within Google that's sort of
upset about a lot of this.

1636
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:23,791
Oh,
that's interesting.

1637
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:27,060
So there are some conservative people 
that work at Google.

1638
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,063
Yeah,
I mean there's definitely more than 

1639
01:20:29,851 --> 01:20:31,410
zero,
more than zero.

1640
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:33,060
Um,
is it like 20 percent,

1641
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:33,894
like the amount that are represented,
like women that are representing the 

1642
01:20:36,301 --> 01:20:37,134
company.

1643
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:38,570
So I,
it,

1644
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:42,740
it may be that or even lower,
I think there's a lot of libertarians.

1645
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,940
So that would be the main counter to the
extreme left.

1646
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:49,910
But,
and then like,

1647
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:50,744
so like what the main retributions 
against people are the social 

1648
01:20:54,291 --> 01:20:58,310
conservatives and they feel completely 
alienated.

1649
01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:04,420
So it's really unfortunate for them.
But I,

1650
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:08,450
yeah,
there's at least hundreds of them

1651
01:21:09,190 --> 01:21:11,320
now.
When you say like social conservatives,

1652
01:21:11,321 --> 01:21:12,970
like what,
what do you,

1653
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,290
how do you classify that?
Like what would,

1654
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:21,170
I mean I guess people that believe in 
traditional values and

1655
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:26,980
homophobes say it.
So I think this is

1656
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:32,520
a lot of what's happening too on where 
people just assume,

1657
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:33,354
okay,
because you believe say in traditional 

1658
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:40,170
values and you think that your marriage 
is an important thing and you know,

1659
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,430
I think that there is evidence that uh,
you know,

1660
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,460
bringing out people in a two parent 
household whether or not it's,

1661
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:48,693
you know,
the same sex or different sex that is 

1662
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:51,444
important for children and there there's
a huge disparity and outcome of people 

1663
01:21:54,871 --> 01:21:55,704
with only one parent versus two.
So there is something to be said about 

1664
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:04,490
marriage and having cultural norms that 
support that,

1665
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,143
but so you're just completely alienating
that side of the argument is really 

1666
01:22:12,121 --> 01:22:14,850
negative and that's hurt our society in 
general,

1667
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:15,610
I think.

1668
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,443
Yeah.
Well I think anytime you silence 

1669
01:22:19,341 --> 01:22:20,174
discussion based on your own personal 
ideas of what should and shouldn't be 

1670
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,860
debated,
I think becomes an issue.

1671
01:22:29,861 --> 01:22:33,480
I mean,
you can disagree with someone and that's

1672
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:38,490
a very complicated issue when it comes 
to whether or not to parents or,

1673
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:39,703
or more beneficial to a child than one 
because obviously there's a lot of 

1674
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:45,730
reasons why people break up,
you know,

1675
01:22:45,731 --> 01:22:48,820
you don't want to encourage people to be
in toxic relationships and then show the

1676
01:22:48,821 --> 01:22:50,680
child that,
you know,

1677
01:22:50,681 --> 01:22:53,110
this is a framework for a loving 
relationship.

1678
01:22:53,111 --> 01:22:53,944
People that scream at each other and 
whatever horrible shit they do to each 

1679
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:58,060
other,
that gets super complicated and very,

1680
01:22:58,061 --> 01:22:58,900
very personal.
Right?

1681
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:00,080
Yeah.
It's,

1682
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,990
it's definitely a touchy subject,
a very personal one.

1683
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:04,220
Yeah.
So I,

1684
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:09,260
I don't know how to address that,
but I think it's at least something that

1685
01:23:10,121 --> 01:23:12,430
we should be cognizant of.

1686
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:13,453
Has Anybody said when you know,
these white people are being shamed in 

1687
01:23:16,341 --> 01:23:17,100
this,
you know,

1688
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,530
as anybody ever stepped up and say,
Hey,

1689
01:23:18,531 --> 01:23:19,610
this is racist.

1690
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:24,380
They might've but never in a public 
forum that I ever.

1691
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:27,720
But publicly white people have been 
criticized.

1692
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,530
Right.
And you know,

1693
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:34,970
there's all these negative stereotypes 
of men and white people and you know,

1694
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:37,720
those gender stereotypes are fine.
But,

1695
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:40,650
and you know,
the whole idea that,

1696
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:42,143
you know,
I'm only here because of my white male 

1697
01:23:43,621 --> 01:23:44,454
privilege,
therefore I'm somehow worst programmer 

1698
01:23:46,711 --> 01:23:51,240
than all the other non white non males.
Is that implied or is that stated?

1699
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:52,833
I think it's implied that they get it 
easier in life and in the interview 

1700
01:23:57,121 --> 01:23:59,940
process and evaluations.
Yeah,

1701
01:23:59,941 --> 01:24:02,780
white and Asian males.
So how's it implied though?

1702
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:03,693
Can you give me an example?
And they'll say explicitly that just 

1703
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:08,310
yes,
these,

1704
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:10,830
these groups of people are 
disadvantaged,

1705
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:11,813
these are advantaged,
there's this privilege that they have 

1706
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:15,383
and we've seen it time and again through
all these evaluation processes that 

1707
01:24:18,661 --> 01:24:23,480
they're better evaluated and these are 
worse and yeah,

1708
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:24,323
they like,
they often just see whatever data that 

1709
01:24:26,731 --> 01:24:27,940
they want,
you know,

1710
01:24:27,941 --> 01:24:28,774
like the case before where they just 
pulled out the female side without 

1711
01:24:33,121 --> 01:24:33,954
seeing that,
oh the male side was pretty much the 

1712
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:38,530
same [inaudible] and it's crazy and 
they,

1713
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:40,980
you even see it in some of their 
internal studies where,

1714
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:41,973
you know,
they were trying to show how racist or 

1715
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:48,100
sexist Google was and how worse women 
habits.

1716
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,880
So they were looking at the code review 
process where you know,

1717
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:55,290
you can submit code to be reviewed and 
then someone has to approve it before it

1718
01:24:55,291 --> 01:24:57,930
goes into the code base and they were 
looking at,

1719
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,330
okay,
if a woman's the author of it,

1720
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:04,120
how many comments do they get on this 
review and you know,

1721
01:25:04,130 --> 01:25:04,963
if they got more comments then that 
would mean that their work is more 

1722
01:25:07,951 --> 01:25:11,070
scrutinized.
But if they got fewer comments then they

1723
01:25:11,071 --> 01:25:14,640
were just ignored.
And so there's no way out of it,

1724
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,733
you know,
any result which show that women are 

1725
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:22,050
being discriminated,
discriminated against somehow.

1726
01:25:23,780 --> 01:25:25,220
Wow.
Man,

1727
01:25:25,221 --> 01:25:30,221
I'm glad I don't work where you worked.
You happy to be free of that at all?

1728
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:35,210
I missed the free food.
Good food there.

1729
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:36,590
Yeah,
I liked the food a lot.

1730
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,930
I had a friend who is a big executive 
over there,

1731
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:41,810
a woman by the way,
woman.

1732
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:44,180
Oh Shit.
Um,

1733
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:45,050
yeah,
she,

1734
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:48,020
she enjoyed it but she said it was a 
mess like in.

1735
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:49,723
She didn't know how,
obviously have the same issues that you 

1736
01:25:52,311 --> 01:25:54,230
had,
but she was like that.

1737
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:59,150
The whole thing is just chaos yet.
Stupid shit going on over there.

1738
01:25:59,151 --> 01:25:59,984
She hated it.

1739
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:04,040
There's definitely,
and I went in a little bit in this,

1740
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:09,041
in the document to where if you have a 
company that's to progressively run,

1741
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:12,500
then it'll be sort of this,
you know,

1742
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:13,334
everyone's equal and no hierarchy and 
all chaos and are constantly changing 

1743
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:19,821
wild,
you know,

1744
01:26:19,821 --> 01:26:23,420
the opposite of a really conservative 
company where there's a lot of hierarchy

1745
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:27,380
decisions are made from the top with 
which may not be,

1746
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:30,110
you know,
very easy to change things.

1747
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:31,423
So like iron.
Google is definitely more of the former 

1748
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:36,373
where there is a lot of chaos and 
there's multiple teams working on the 

1749
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:43,781
same thing and it's just this is how we 
have multiple products that end up doing

1750
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:47,750
the same thing and we have to deprecate 
some bright like we have.

1751
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:50,930
That's very inefficient for different 
chat apps.

1752
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:52,880
Well Google is

1753
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,100
as in the technology realm,
but they're not,

1754
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:57,800
they don't have a lot of competition.
That's what's really interesting.

1755
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,680
But then they do in certain ways,
right?

1756
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:03,620
Like they do in the phone way.
Like they put out the Pixel,

1757
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:05,600
which I bought,
which is kind of a fucked up phone.

1758
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,790
Yeah.
It doesn't feel like the,

1759
01:27:08,540 --> 01:27:10,430
the microphone doesn't work all the 
time.

1760
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:11,713
Yeah.
Like could you have to let go to 

1761
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:14,270
speakerphone and then bring it back to 
microphone?

1762
01:27:14,271 --> 01:27:16,880
Just a bunch of bugs.
So quite a few issues with it.

1763
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:20,360
Then there's the android operating 
system which a lot of people prefer.

1764
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:22,130
So I think they're like pretty 
competitive in that round.

1765
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:26,450
But like um,
when it comes to like search engine,

1766
01:27:26,451 --> 01:27:31,030
so they don't really have competition.
That's where it gets real sneaky because

1767
01:27:31,060 --> 01:27:33,320
a lot of power in that search search 
engine.

1768
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:35,160
And then in Gmail.
What,

1769
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:35,870
what?
Uh.

1770
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,960
Well you know,
what competition they have in Gmail as a

1771
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:42,800
fuck about hotmail.
I started using

1772
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:43,683
Yahoo Mail because people were really 
suspicious that google would eventually 

1773
01:27:48,191 --> 01:27:51,370
read my email.
Oh Wow.

1774
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:54,460
Do you really worry about that?
That they would spy on your email?

1775
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:56,920
There were some weird things happening 
to my phone,

1776
01:27:56,921 --> 01:28:00,100
so I had like one attached to it yet.
What?

1777
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:01,660
Uh,
so my Corp,

1778
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,630
so Corp,
my work phone and basically.

1779
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:05,593
Okay.
And it started like rebooting and after 

1780
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:14,010
this whole controversy given android.
Yeah,

1781
01:28:14,290 --> 01:28:15,123
it's.
And this had never happened before and 

1782
01:28:16,811 --> 01:28:21,550
it hasn't happened and didn't like all 
these random apps started updating.

1783
01:28:22,330 --> 01:28:23,560
It was Kinda scary.
But.

1784
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:26,140
So do you think they start spying on 
you?

1785
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,393
It's your way to find out.
I don't know if there's a way to find 

1786
01:28:29,531 --> 01:28:30,470
out.
Fuck,

1787
01:28:31,390 --> 01:28:35,410
I'd put my phone aside and bring it to 
light the top technologist and go,

1788
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:36,273
listen,
we've got to go over this because 

1789
01:28:37,841 --> 01:28:40,360
that'll be giant dude.
If you found they were spying on you,

1790
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:43,390
is there anything in your contract that 
allows them to spy on you?

1791
01:28:43,391 --> 01:28:44,210
Yeah,

1792
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:46,150
there's some random things where they.
Yeah,

1793
01:28:46,151 --> 01:28:49,090
they can basically just spy on you 
completely.

1794
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,760
Yeah.
Like how,

1795
01:28:50,761 --> 01:28:51,594
so uh,
so all of your keystrokes or sort of 

1796
01:28:53,831 --> 01:28:58,780
logged in at work or.
I'm the work computer.

1797
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,153
Yeah.
Not necessarily your personal laptop or 

1798
01:29:01,261 --> 01:29:02,130
anything.
Okay.

1799
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:06,030
What about your phone yet?
So I don't know exactly what they do,

1800
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:06,864
but the corporate phone,
my Google Dot com account attached to 

1801
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:12,060
it.
Okay.

1802
01:29:12,061 --> 01:29:14,370
But it wasn't your personal phone?
Yeah,

1803
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,750
I bought it.
But then.

1804
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,350
Oh,
so yeah,

1805
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:19,213
they,
they reserved the right to like 

1806
01:29:20,191 --> 01:29:23,660
completely new kit and what?
Yeah,

1807
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:26,310
served right to,
to nuke your personal phone.

1808
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:27,413
Now this corporate phone,
are you allowed to use it for like say 

1809
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:31,920
if you go on a date or you want to buy a
movie ticket or.

1810
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:32,754
So you're allowed to use that.

1811
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:33,793
Yeah,
so that's a weird marriage of two 

1812
01:29:35,721 --> 01:29:36,554
worlds,
isn't it?

1813
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:37,910
Yeah,
it's,

1814
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:40,400
some people would own two phones because
of that,

1815
01:29:40,401 --> 01:29:42,140
but you know,
I was,

1816
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:43,063
I'm a cheap person again,
I don't want to have google pay for 

1817
01:29:46,521 --> 01:29:47,354
extra stuff and I mean I can understand 
why they would want that because 

1818
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:52,333
especially,
you know,

1819
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:57,400
I was traveling to China for some of my 
work and supposedly if they see that you

1820
01:29:58,221 --> 01:29:59,054
work for Google,
they'll just steal your laptop or your 

1821
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:03,410
phone or they won't even explicitly 
steal it.

1822
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:04,483
They'll go into your room and then 
install some software on it and then 

1823
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:09,403
just put it there and then the Chinese 
government will somehow get into 

1824
01:30:12,981 --> 01:30:14,660
Google's networks.
Whoa.

1825
01:30:14,840 --> 01:30:17,990
So I mean they're rightfully paranoid 
about somethings,

1826
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:23,350
but sometimes it's you don't want to 
give one entity too much power.

1827
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,100
Yeah.
My friend who worked for Google was very

1828
01:30:27,101 --> 01:30:27,934
upset at this whole China thing because 
essentially she was saying they have to 

1829
01:30:31,271 --> 01:30:35,350
agree to censorship the Chinese 
censorship and that the only alternative

1830
01:30:35,351 --> 01:30:36,184
is to let China steel all of what 
Google's doing and make a fake google 

1831
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:42,670
because that's what they were doing 
apparently.

1832
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:43,693
Yeah.
To make sure that they didn't allow 

1833
01:30:45,431 --> 01:30:46,264
that.
And then to do that they had to have 

1834
01:30:47,801 --> 01:30:48,634
certain things like tenement square,
you couldn't search for that and it's 

1835
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:51,473
like a lot of weird shit that they would
have to sensor any dissented the 

1836
01:30:55,391 --> 01:31:00,160
government and you know,
gets very slippery.

1837
01:31:00,161 --> 01:31:01,350
Right?
I mean like yeah,

1838
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,970
you're anti diverse or you're pro 
diversity,

1839
01:31:03,971 --> 01:31:07,900
but you're also,
you're supporting that like as a company

1840
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:10,203
that's a giant issue.
Like to allow China to censor it 

1841
01:31:14,611 --> 01:31:15,670
citizens.
I mean you're,

1842
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:19,540
you're essentially promoting a 
dictatorship in that regard.

1843
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:22,530
Yeah.
It's sort of a lose lose.

1844
01:31:22,531 --> 01:31:26,610
I don't know what exactly they should do
and they just did it for business.

1845
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:29,850
I think I just made a business choice 
and so fucking scary choice to.

1846
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:31,920
Yeah,
well I mean they.

1847
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:35,250
They were in China and they supported 
some of this stuff,

1848
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:38,160
but then they eventually chose not to 
because they backed out of it.

1849
01:31:38,460 --> 01:31:41,210
Is that recent?
That was a,

1850
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:43,850
I don't know.
Before my time at Google at nationally,

1851
01:31:44,470 --> 01:31:46,920
so they decided to get out so they're 
not involved with China anymore.

1852
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:50,400
It's blocked by the firewall.
China block,

1853
01:31:50,401 --> 01:31:53,040
Google and all of Google services.

1854
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:56,110
Don't they have some weird thing you can
get around that though,

1855
01:31:56,111 --> 01:31:58,480
but that's super illegal if you get 
around that,

1856
01:31:58,481 --> 01:31:59,950
you get in really big trouble.

1857
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:00,963
Yeah.
Although their official policy is that 

1858
01:32:02,410 --> 01:32:06,190
there is no firewall,
so I don't know if they have any laws to

1859
01:32:06,191 --> 01:32:10,660
actually imagine that fucking building 
people.

1860
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:12,320
They figured out how to do that to them 
yet,

1861
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:15,760
although I think China is not the only 
case where this is happening.

1862
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:20,080
There's other countries where Google 
also has the sensor.

1863
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:21,161
Really?
Yeah,

1864
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:21,994
like in the Middle East.
There's some company or some countries 

1865
01:32:25,301 --> 01:32:29,170
that do that.
It gets really complicated.

1866
01:32:29,790 --> 01:32:31,530
Yeah.
I could imagine.

1867
01:32:31,531 --> 01:32:32,580
Look,
I don't envy them,

1868
01:32:33,350 --> 01:32:34,183
I don't,
and I don't envy any of the people that 

1869
01:32:35,821 --> 01:32:39,930
work there and management that are sort 
of responsible for putting out,

1870
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:41,483
you know,
an infinite number of forest fires all 

1871
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:46,380
around them all the time.
Social Economic,

1872
01:32:46,950 --> 01:32:50,700
you know,
dealing with different cultures.

1873
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:51,733
It's not,
it doesn't seem like it'd be an easy 

1874
01:32:52,501 --> 01:32:53,334
gig.

1875
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:55,420
Yeah.
And I,

1876
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:57,510
one of the ways they have now too is you
know,

1877
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:02,150
even though they have a large market 
share for a search,

1878
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:03,463
they see search as sort of a gateway to 
the world and they don't necessarily 

1879
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:09,350
have a huge market share for that 
because you know,

1880
01:33:09,351 --> 01:33:14,351
facebook and twitter are also ways to 
get to the world's information and a lot

1881
01:33:15,951 --> 01:33:16,784
of facebook just,
it's just a walled garden where Google 

1882
01:33:19,521 --> 01:33:22,160
can't really get into that.
So some people just.

1883
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:23,173
And you know,
on your phone you spend most of your 

1884
01:33:24,441 --> 01:33:25,274
time on facebook or something and not 
necessarily just doing random google 

1885
01:33:28,911 --> 01:33:29,744
searches,
you know?

1886
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,760
Yeah.
I got off of that.

1887
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:35,250
I don't really go on facebook for that 
very reason.

1888
01:33:35,251 --> 01:33:39,510
It seems to be to be the biggest sucker 
time that we have.

1889
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:42,060
I just,
I feel like twitter to me is like,

1890
01:33:42,061 --> 01:33:45,870
it's limited by 140 characters.
It seems pretty straightforward.

1891
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,050
I get links.
Good.

1892
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:50,880
Interesting.
Stories get sent to me that for my needs

1893
01:33:50,910 --> 01:33:53,220
that's more,
it's more appealing.

1894
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:56,580
And then instagram is very appealing 
because I like images so you can look at

1895
01:33:56,581 --> 01:33:57,414
pictures and sometimes people write cool
captions and you find out about 

1896
01:34:00,031 --> 01:34:02,450
interesting shit.
But facebook is like,

1897
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,420
whew,
boy,

1898
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:05,970
you're gonna lose a lot of time on that 
motherfucker.

1899
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:10,560
Oh,
so this is a random tangent.

1900
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:15,561
But I knew so I worked on image search 
and they also see that even though there

1901
01:34:17,191 --> 01:34:18,960
isn't a huge competitor for image 
search,

1902
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:23,910
there's instagram and pinterest which 
are very similar things and you know,

1903
01:34:23,911 --> 01:34:24,744
we do our demographic research and we 
really look into why people are using 

1904
01:34:28,111 --> 01:34:28,944
these products and we see that the 
majority of the users are women and you 

1905
01:34:33,691 --> 01:34:35,580
know,
they actually know why that is.

1906
01:34:35,581 --> 01:34:37,770
It's that women prefer,
you know,

1907
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:42,420
art and aesthetics over men and on 
average.

1908
01:34:42,421 --> 01:34:43,254
Right.
And that's exactly what I had in the 

1909
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:45,234
document,
like we openly acknowledge this when 

1910
01:34:48,631 --> 01:34:52,740
we're looking at the products because 
otherwise you're not going to give these

1911
01:34:52,741 --> 01:34:53,574
random ads to people that you know,
if you know that they're a man and 

1912
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:58,130
you're not going to give them ads for

1913
01:34:58,330 --> 01:34:59,210
women products,
you know.

1914
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:04,910
So ad science does discriminate and 
stereotype people in some ways,

1915
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:11,310
but it's okay now they're getting into 
trying to de bias machine learning.

1916
01:35:17,331 --> 01:35:18,164
So if they do see any things that the 
machine learning has learned these 

1917
01:35:22,601 --> 01:35:27,601
statistical anomalies or just trends in 
the data,

1918
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:28,853
then they'll try to remove that.
Why that seems like it would be less 

1919
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:34,640
effective.
It's less effective,

1920
01:35:34,641 --> 01:35:36,830
but they see it as discrimination.
Social Justice.

1921
01:35:36,831 --> 01:35:37,664
Yeah.
It's

1922
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,740
and mess.
What a mess.

1923
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:43,780
Bang.
You need to step up your game.

1924
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:47,080
Come on back.
Bring back that windows phone.

1925
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,810
Come on.
Hotmail.

1926
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:52,000
Microsoft had hotmail,
right?

1927
01:35:52,030 --> 01:35:54,280
Nobody uses hotmail.
Does that even real anymore?

1928
01:35:54,930 --> 01:35:59,930
They have hotmail I think so I saw,
I've been getting a lot of emails from,

1929
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,153
you know,
pretty paranoid people and some of them 

1930
01:36:03,551 --> 01:36:04,690
are from hot now.
So.

1931
01:36:04,750 --> 01:36:06,790
Oh yeah.
How about AOL?

1932
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:08,480
Yeah.
Well dot comment on.

1933
01:36:08,490 --> 01:36:10,060
Well,
what the fuck all is real.

1934
01:36:10,430 --> 01:36:14,050
Who the hell is aol?
Where are you right now?

1935
01:36:14,070 --> 01:36:15,400
Like where we're,
where are you?

1936
01:36:15,430 --> 01:36:19,060
What do you do with your time?
The I read books,

1937
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:21,970
uh,
respond to media requires a lot of them.

1938
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:24,760
Yeah.
I still get a lot and you know,

1939
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,400
thankfully now some of them are more of 
the long form,

1940
01:36:27,401 --> 01:36:31,780
which ilr I like a lot more than just 
the five minute TV thing.

1941
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:33,643
I wanted to give you as much time as he 
could to just talk about this and 

1942
01:36:37,121 --> 01:36:38,960
especially after I heard you on Ben 
Shapiro,

1943
01:36:38,961 --> 01:36:42,070
Cheryl show,
I'm like this getting the shaft.

1944
01:36:42,071 --> 01:36:45,580
You're very reasonable person.
You're not a misogynist at all as far as

1945
01:36:45,581 --> 01:36:48,880
I can tell he,
you don't seem like a sexist.

1946
01:36:48,881 --> 01:36:51,940
You don't seem cruel.
You're not like the type of person.

1947
01:36:51,941 --> 01:36:52,774
I think we'd go out of their way to 
promote some sort of a quote unquote 

1948
01:36:54,971 --> 01:36:59,620
harmful stereotype gender stereotype.
It just seems so weird.

1949
01:36:59,710 --> 01:37:00,543
Especially like I personally am just 
very conscious about a lot of these 

1950
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:07,900
gender stereotypes and you know,
I use the word day whenever the,

1951
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:09,463
uh,
when I read the gender of someone is 

1952
01:37:11,021 --> 01:37:11,854
unknown or just unimportant [inaudible] 
and like I try to avoid using guys 

1953
01:37:16,150 --> 01:37:18,110
instead of just like you all or 
something.

1954
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:19,090
Yeah.
I say folks,

1955
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:22,030
I try to say folks now because I used to
say guys lot,

1956
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:26,380
you know,
I try to use the term folks yet for that

1957
01:37:26,381 --> 01:37:27,214
very reason.

1958
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,190
Yeah.
And you know,

1959
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,640
if I get married,
I,

1960
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:34,450
I would actually try to merge our last 
name somehow.

1961
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:35,640
Don't do that dude.
Not,

1962
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:37,660
not like the highest band,
not the hyphen,

1963
01:37:37,661 --> 01:37:40,210
but just like create a new name,
create a new name.

1964
01:37:40,211 --> 01:37:42,310
That would be the coolest if,
if you can do it.

1965
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:42,791
Well,
you know,

1966
01:37:42,791 --> 01:37:44,620
the former mayor of Los Angeles did 
that.

1967
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:45,371
Really?
Yeah.

1968
01:37:45,371 --> 01:37:46,204
His name is Tony Volare and his wife had
this ethnic name and so they changed it 

1969
01:37:51,011 --> 01:37:56,011
and put it together and he came to Villa
Arago Lavilla or Villaraigosa.

1970
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:00,390
I think that's what his name was,
but it made him seem like he was Mexican

1971
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:05,430
and so that's why you went with it and 
he kept it even after they got divorced.

1972
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:07,423
Yeah,
it's super like Adam Kroll is shits on 

1973
01:38:09,161 --> 01:38:09,994
them for it.
I didn't even know about it until he 

1974
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:12,540
explained it to me.
I went what?

1975
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:16,380
Like it's a fake name because I mean I 
just,

1976
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:18,090
I,
I don't.

1977
01:38:18,091 --> 01:38:22,470
I wouldn't want my wife to take my last 
name and lose theirs.

1978
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,600
I refuse to let my wife use her own 
name.

1979
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:26,510
You can?
Yeah.

1980
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:32,300
Villa or young.
Go saw Villaraigosa for Laura goes.

1981
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:35,550
You could make a really cool last name.
Yeah,

1982
01:38:35,551 --> 01:38:36,990
that's what he did.
I mean,

1983
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:42,020
he was Volare Antonio Ramon Volare 
junior and his wife was a Ria.

1984
01:38:42,270 --> 01:38:44,760
Goza.
That's pretty cool.

1985
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:47,640
Then they split up,
but he kept that name.

1986
01:38:48,270 --> 01:38:49,103
Kept that fucking ethnic name.
As long as you don't Google search at 

1987
01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:53,280
when you do you go,
Hey,

1988
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:55,740
what?
What's your dad's name,

1989
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:56,603
Bro?

1990
01:38:58,230 --> 01:38:59,063
Yeah.
I mean there are people that have stage 

1991
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:03,250
names are okay.
Yeah.

1992
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:06,660
I'm Nikki Glaser at a very funny joke 
about that and she stand up.

1993
01:39:06,661 --> 01:39:08,700
Comedian,
she had a funny joke about,

1994
01:39:08,701 --> 01:39:11,310
um,
your old name,

1995
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:12,503
you know,
and then like when a woman gets married 

1996
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:16,920
and then like her all,
her name is when her son and gets locked

1997
01:39:16,921 --> 01:39:20,730
out of his bank account and needs to 
know mom was your old day.

1998
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:25,110
Like in terms of like how to access his 
account with a password.

1999
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:26,880
Yeah,
I mean,

2000
01:39:27,030 --> 01:39:27,863
yeah,
it'd be nice if everybody just kept 

2001
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:31,410
their own fucking name.
But then once you do to the kids,

2002
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,810
that's yes.
To kill the kid,

2003
01:39:33,811 --> 01:39:36,670
to pick your favorite parent.
Yeah.

2004
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:37,523
Who's your favorite parent?
Have a meritocracy inside your own 

2005
01:39:41,251 --> 01:39:43,710
family now you can't do that,
right?

2006
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:45,490
Yeah.
And then if you have it,

2007
01:39:45,491 --> 01:39:48,040
so the first child is this second child,
is that,

2008
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,280
then it just gets too confusing.

2009
01:39:50,280 --> 01:39:52,050
And then what if you changed your name 
and then you break up,

2010
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:52,913
you go back to your old name.
It depends on how cool it is a bit out 

2011
01:39:57,161 --> 01:40:00,450
of and then you keep it.
It's good.

2012
01:40:00,630 --> 01:40:04,620
It keeps you in great shape with the 
ethnic market markets maybe.

2013
01:40:04,680 --> 01:40:05,790
Maybe.
Yeah.

2014
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:07,290
Tricky.
I don't know.

2015
01:40:07,320 --> 01:40:11,400
Marriage in itself is very weird.
It's some sort of strange legal contract

2016
01:40:11,401 --> 01:40:13,440
with the state that involves 
relationships,

2017
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:14,274
which is just so bizarre,
which is why 50 percent of them fall 

2018
01:40:17,161 --> 01:40:18,310
apart,
you know,

2019
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:21,420
and that's.
Chris Rock had a great joke about that.

2020
01:40:21,421 --> 01:40:25,170
That's the coward's that stay like how 
many,

2021
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:28,290
how many of the people stay 50 percent 
left.

2022
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:29,263
Like how many people are fucking 
miserable and they're still involved in 

2023
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:36,060
that contract and it's 50 percent that 
fail.

2024
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:37,800
It's a good argument,
you know?

2025
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:39,540
Yeah.
It is.

2026
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:40,374
It the 50 percent of the initial ones 
get a breaking up or just 50 percent of 

2027
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:45,210
all marriages.

2028
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:49,740
So like there are some that get married 
10 times and they get counted in that 50

2029
01:40:49,741 --> 01:40:50,574
percent.
Yes.

2030
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:53,890
Because initial marriages,
like if you get a union.

2031
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:54,760
I do,
I do.

2032
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:58,510
How many of those work?
Fifty percent stay unionized?

2033
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,280
Oh Man.
Of the first one.

2034
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,320
That's pretty bad.
It's not good.

2035
01:41:02,450 --> 01:41:03,580
Yeah,
it's not good.

2036
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:04,993
I'm,
I'm happily married and I tell people 

2037
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:09,670
don't do it.
I'm worried that it's not worth it,

2038
01:41:09,671 --> 01:41:12,400
it's a fucking ridiculous proposition.
And if you're,

2039
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:15,010
um,
whether you're male or female,

2040
01:41:15,011 --> 01:41:17,350
that makes a lot of money and the spouse
doesn't,

2041
01:41:17,410 --> 01:41:20,110
then you run into this very weird 
situation,

2042
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,190
you know,
it's,

2043
01:41:22,730 --> 01:41:25,520
it's scary.
[inaudible] and you know,

2044
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:28,120
potential of losing custody of kids.
Yes.

2045
01:41:28,390 --> 01:41:29,470
Yeah.
It gets real weird,

2046
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:32,230
but it makes sense with children because
you know,

2047
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,093
like look,
creating life is way more of a 

2048
01:41:35,261 --> 01:41:38,110
commitment than divorce and marriage 
because you could,

2049
01:41:38,230 --> 01:41:39,460
you could easily get divorced.

2050
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,610
People do it every day,
but creating life is like,

2051
01:41:42,970 --> 01:41:47,380
that's a significant responsibility.
I mean it's gigantic.

2052
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:48,363
You could get along with someone else.
I mean you could get divorced and go 

2053
01:41:51,311 --> 01:41:52,144
through all the turmoil and all the 
stress and then find a new person and 

2054
01:41:55,301 --> 01:41:57,280
maybe they'll be.
Maybe it'll be better.

2055
01:41:57,281 --> 01:41:58,114
Maybe marry that person and to work out.
Well maybe you learned from your first 

2056
01:42:00,581 --> 01:42:01,414
relationship,
but I think the commitment of raising a 

2057
01:42:06,941 --> 01:42:11,941
human being is way more of a,
like a serious long term responsibility.

2058
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:15,970
So if you could do that,
like you can stay married,

2059
01:42:16,740 --> 01:42:20,110
if it work it out,
as long as the person's reasonable get a

2060
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:20,944
reasonable person would.
Do you know anyone that's getting an 

2061
01:42:22,811 --> 01:42:25,510
arranged marriage or has arranged 
marriage?

2062
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:26,583
No,
I don't because those actually it was a 

2063
01:42:28,141 --> 01:42:30,970
weird day.
Stay together more than not 50 percent.

2064
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:31,840
Really?

2065
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,580
Yeah.
So like,

2066
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:34,360
like,
uh,

2067
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:35,193
like rich parents get together with 
another rich family and they bring over 

2068
01:42:38,021 --> 01:42:41,650
the daughter and we kind of not 
necessarily just rich.

2069
01:42:41,651 --> 01:42:46,090
I think that happens a lot and more 
traditional countries like India,

2070
01:42:46,091 --> 01:42:47,400
it's still happens.
What does that,

2071
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,870
the divorce is over,
but the myth lives on.

2072
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:52,830
That's a chick or wrote that.
I just thought propaganda.

2073
01:42:52,831 --> 01:42:55,570
That's fake news.
Get that shit off the screen.

2074
01:42:55,780 --> 01:42:58,660
What does it say?
I just saw another article in psychology

2075
01:42:58,661 --> 01:42:59,494
today.
It said it's down to about 25 or 75 

2076
01:43:01,451 --> 01:43:03,400
percent survive.
Wow.

2077
01:43:03,401 --> 01:43:04,810
Yeah.
One in four and a divorce.

2078
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:06,460
But if you get married a second or third
time,

2079
01:43:06,461 --> 01:43:07,620
the rates go way up.
Yeah,

2080
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:12,070
that makes sense.
It says it's like a myth,

2081
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:13,840
quote unquote myth from the seventies 
and eighties.

2082
01:43:13,841 --> 01:43:14,674
But there also isn't the amount of time 
if you got married in the last 10 years 

2083
01:43:17,501 --> 01:43:20,170
to say you're going to get divorced in 
20 more years,

2084
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:21,213
I would like to know what the actual 
hard data with the United States of 

2085
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:24,813
America.
Because culturally it gets weird when 

2086
01:43:25,511 --> 01:43:26,344
you look across the different countries.
But what about the United States of 

2087
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:30,333
America?
What are the percentage of people who 

2088
01:43:32,021 --> 01:43:34,390
get married to wind up getting divorced?
Let's find that out.

2089
01:43:34,660 --> 01:43:36,120
What do you say it is?
Oh,

2090
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:37,950
across the world?
No,

2091
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:38,260
no,
no.

2092
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,450
Just United States.
The United States.

2093
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,390
I would think I'm sort of trusting that 
random.

2094
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:45,670
You think it's about 25 percent?
Get divorced.

2095
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:49,330
Divorce rate in the US drops to nearly 
40 year low.

2096
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:52,240
Wow.
Look at this represents

2097
01:43:52,250 --> 01:43:56,990
a jump from 31 point nine and 2014 and 
is the highest number.

2098
01:43:57,270 --> 01:43:58,940
Okay.
30 two point two.

2099
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:00,553
Okay.
Marriage rates the other hand have 

2100
01:44:01,701 --> 01:44:04,640
increased.
There's 32 point two marriages for every

2101
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:06,890
thousand unmarried,
but what is the divorce rate?

2102
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:10,100
16 point nine for a thousand married 
women.

2103
01:44:10,101 --> 01:44:12,080
Fifteen year old.
What is the fucking percentage?

2104
01:44:12,081 --> 01:44:12,914
You fucking 23.
They throw around too many 50 percent 

2105
01:44:16,491 --> 01:44:17,324
chance.
Okay.

2106
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:20,810
Typical marriage is still have a 50 
percent chance of lasting.

2107
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:23,510
That's all I said.
So same goddamn number.

2108
01:44:23,630 --> 01:44:24,463
Researchers have found that typical 
marriage is still have about a 50 

2109
01:44:27,501 --> 01:44:30,870
percent chance of lasting.
That's very fucking.

2110
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:36,460
This is still just colored including the
second and third marriages and beyond.

2111
01:44:38,850 --> 01:44:39,960
Well,
marriage is marriage.

2112
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:42,330
I mean if you have a second,
marriage means you failed.

2113
01:44:43,100 --> 01:44:44,490
It means you got divorced.
Yeah.

2114
01:44:44,491 --> 01:44:45,420
Yeah.
But if.

2115
01:44:45,470 --> 01:44:46,303
Go back to that Jamie please.
It says researchers have found that 

2116
01:44:51,431 --> 01:44:55,060
typical marriages still have a 50 
percent chance of lasting.

2117
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:58,240
That means you have a 50 percent chance 
of not lasting,

2118
01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:02,550
but that's just assuming you look at 
every single marriage,

2119
01:45:02,551 --> 01:45:03,384
but if you look at the first marriage,
then maybe you have a 70 percent chance 

2120
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:11,010
of never getting a divorce and then.
But if you do get it,

2121
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:15,640
so you like factored in when people are 
in like the second,

2122
01:45:15,641 --> 01:45:16,840
third and fourth,
Maryland.

2123
01:45:17,230 --> 01:45:20,680
Those Elizabeth Taylor type folks.
I was like nine or 10 marriages,

2124
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:26,340
so it might have reduced because people 
are just getting married later,

2125
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:29,220
so they're choosing rather than just,
Oh,

2126
01:45:29,221 --> 01:45:33,750
I got pregnant when I was young or I 
didn't have anything else to do,

2127
01:45:33,751 --> 01:45:34,540
so I got married.

2128
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:35,373
We'll get that.
Hawaii had the lowest because it's 

2129
01:45:36,911 --> 01:45:37,744
fucking awesome.
Then maybe if you live somewhere 

2130
01:45:38,921 --> 01:45:40,960
awesome,
they have universal basic income.

2131
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:42,091
Great.
Why?

2132
01:45:42,091 --> 01:45:44,680
They're great marriages.
What did you put up,

2133
01:45:44,681 --> 01:45:46,190
Jamie?
What do you highlighted?

2134
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,073
Uh,
just other things that they're saying 

2135
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:49,174
factor and like cohabitating has become 
less stigmatized so they're not living 

2136
01:45:52,151 --> 01:45:53,950
together but not getting married as 
another thing.

2137
01:45:54,490 --> 01:45:54,971
Oh,
okay.

2138
01:45:54,971 --> 01:45:58,570
People don't look to shore up and 
unstable relationship.

2139
01:45:58,571 --> 01:46:00,580
Marriage rates have been declining for 
years,

2140
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:03,870
so less people get married,
but the percentage is still.

2141
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:05,890
You also don't have to get married when 
you have a kid right now.

2142
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:06,790
That's right.
Right,

2143
01:46:06,790 --> 01:46:07,940
right.
Brushing and do it.

2144
01:46:08,010 --> 01:46:08,740
Right.
Right,

2145
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:10,420
right.
It's less stigmatized.

2146
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:11,710
[inaudible].
Yeah.

2147
01:46:11,711 --> 01:46:14,080
I mean,
imagine if that was a friendship thing.

2148
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:16,360
Okay man,
we be best friends or what?

2149
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,400
Fucking go to court dude,
and do this.

2150
01:46:19,450 --> 01:46:21,610
I mean it's just this weird.
I mean,

2151
01:46:21,611 --> 01:46:23,980
it really is,
it does,

2152
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:25,870
it makes sense for some people.
They like it.

2153
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:27,700
People like rituals,
you know,

2154
01:46:28,060 --> 01:46:28,893
feels good to know,
like say it and do it and make it real 

2155
01:46:32,861 --> 01:46:35,240
and jump over the broom like they didn't
roots.

2156
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:37,863
I think one interesting thing that I was
looking into a little bit was the rates 

2157
01:46:41,521 --> 01:46:45,990
of divorce for homosexual marriages 
because that,

2158
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:49,800
that's also sort of interesting.
So one thing about heterosexual is

2159
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:53,280
women and initiate the divorce in 70 
percent of cases.

2160
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:55,440
Of course they do,
which is,

2161
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:56,483
you know,
I wouldn't have necessarily predicted 

2162
01:46:57,901 --> 01:46:58,734
that Adeline.
So I think when we get pissed more like 

2163
01:47:01,531 --> 01:47:04,230
that on you tell you.
Yeah,

2164
01:47:04,231 --> 01:47:06,300
I guess,
but relationships that you've been in,

2165
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:07,343
have women been pissed off at you more 
than you've been pissed off at them or 

2166
01:47:09,271 --> 01:47:11,550
the opposite?
Definitely.

2167
01:47:11,551 --> 01:47:14,020
They get mad at me.
Says you're a God damn.

2168
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:19,020
Promoting harmful gender stereotypes.
I sign up.

2169
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:22,500
I generally just don't get that angry.
So I think that's part of it,

2170
01:47:22,501 --> 01:47:23,730
but that's probably where they get mad 
at you.

2171
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,460
You don't even fucking care.
And so like,

2172
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,640
not to push on the one thing that sort 
of hurt me,

2173
01:47:29,641 --> 01:47:34,641
but the neuroticism trait is actually 
has been linked to on stable marriages.

2174
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:39,090
Women having more of that has been part 
of the explanation for why.

2175
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,253
And so you see in lesbian couples,
they also have a higher rate of divorce 

2176
01:47:44,581 --> 01:47:46,680
then the gay couple,
the gay men.

2177
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:47,933
That's interesting.
So like part of it is women want to 

2178
01:47:50,191 --> 01:47:54,420
settle down much faster so they'll move 
in within like a month.

2179
01:47:55,170 --> 01:47:57,860
And then,
which obviously is,

2180
01:47:57,900 --> 01:48:01,150
you're too soon to know whether or not 
that's a longterm chip.

2181
01:48:01,620 --> 01:48:02,453
Well,
especially if neither one of you are 

2182
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:03,774
flexible and you know,
sort of adapt to each other's needs and 

2183
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:08,040
desires.
So,

2184
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:09,120
uh,
I interrupted you though.

2185
01:48:09,121 --> 01:48:13,080
What is the percentage of gay men who,
how often are they get divorced,

2186
01:48:13,590 --> 01:48:14,423
I don't know the exact numbers,
but it's lower than the lesbian one and 

2187
01:48:18,780 --> 01:48:22,700
because we only had the last few years 
or so of gay marriage.

2188
01:48:22,730 --> 01:48:26,130
So we don't know the actual long term 
rates,

2189
01:48:27,450 --> 01:48:31,550
but it's certainly interesting because,
you know,

2190
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,600
it's a world that I don't know much 
about.

2191
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:35,350
Brian has,
um,

2192
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:41,700
how have you come through all this,
like do you feel damaged by this at all?

2193
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:46,700
Do you feel like your name is this 
marched a definitely,

2194
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:48,983
you know,
I,

2195
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:54,350
I just went to a party with my friends 
and some of them were much closer to and

2196
01:48:54,871 --> 01:48:59,260
I had already talked to about this some 
I hadn't and you know,

2197
01:48:59,261 --> 01:49:02,610
you never know how they felt about it.
So some,

2198
01:49:02,611 --> 01:49:05,700
it seemed like they,
you know,

2199
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:07,680
I could tell that they were like,
oh yeah man,

2200
01:49:08,040 --> 01:49:12,800
hey,
what's up bus bro.

2201
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:18,410
Keep it secret handshake.
But others were maybe a little averse to

2202
01:49:19,951 --> 01:49:23,190
me.
So that may happen in the future,

2203
01:49:23,191 --> 01:49:25,880
but prejudices that they have going into
the conversation.

2204
01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:27,870
Yeah.
And Oh,

2205
01:49:27,871 --> 01:49:28,704
I didn't know that you are a sexist.
What have you gotten that if he hadn't 

2206
01:49:32,051 --> 01:49:36,930
been people like outright insulting you.
There was one person that was on just on

2207
01:49:36,931 --> 01:49:38,340
the roads,
just f you.

2208
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:39,521
Really?
Yeah,

2209
01:49:39,521 --> 01:49:42,810
in the road.
Where was this in mountain view?

2210
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:47,840
So you're driving your car?
I just got out of my car and they just

2211
01:49:48,190 --> 01:49:50,110
yelled at were female.
It was a guy.

2212
01:49:50,370 --> 01:49:55,370
And what he say just after you just fuck
you for what?

2213
01:49:56,900 --> 01:50:00,850
For how do you know that?
That's why he said that.

2214
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,280
Uh,
well yeah.

2215
01:50:03,281 --> 01:50:04,114
I mean I've never really been yelled at 
except by like crazy people on the 

2216
01:50:06,821 --> 01:50:11,500
street with this guy look like just 
normal nerd guy.

2217
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:14,060
Did he have his girlfriend with him 
trying to press her?

2218
01:50:14,090 --> 01:50:17,120
Maybe that con,
that Shit.

2219
01:50:17,121 --> 01:50:17,960
I want to smack him,

2220
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:20,960
God.
But I,

2221
01:50:21,290 --> 01:50:22,123
most of the support or at least like 
personal interactions have been in 

2222
01:50:26,181 --> 01:50:29,120
support of me.
So there've been random people like,

2223
01:50:29,150 --> 01:50:30,140
oh,
are you James Tomorrow?

2224
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:31,003
It's like,
yeah.

2225
01:50:31,620 --> 01:50:34,500
Wow.
So one guy with a girl yelled out,

2226
01:50:34,501 --> 01:50:36,360
fuck you.
And he looked like a nerd.

2227
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:38,160
She'll,
she'll dump him.

2228
01:50:38,910 --> 01:50:39,900
Don't worry about it,
buddy.

2229
01:50:40,260 --> 01:50:42,810
It'll all come around.
I had a friend that was like that.

2230
01:50:42,811 --> 01:50:47,130
He was super fucking male feminist.
And then eventually his,

2231
01:50:47,131 --> 01:50:50,730
uh,
his spouse went nutty on them and crazy.

2232
01:50:50,731 --> 01:50:52,560
And then all of her friends went nutty 
on him.

2233
01:50:52,561 --> 01:50:53,850
And now he's like,
he man,

2234
01:50:53,851 --> 01:50:55,410
woman haters club.
He went the other way.

2235
01:50:55,470 --> 01:50:58,650
Oh really?
Not totally,

2236
01:50:58,651 --> 01:51:00,540
but he's like,
what the fuck man?

2237
01:51:00,541 --> 01:51:01,081
I'm like,
yeah,

2238
01:51:01,081 --> 01:51:01,914
you can't just rely on a gender to be 
cool to rely on individual human beings 

2239
01:51:08,911 --> 01:51:12,030
and their personalities and their 
actions and their character.

2240
01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:14,430
I can't believe we have to actually go 
over this,

2241
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:17,070
but no,
like all in all,

2242
01:51:17,071 --> 01:51:18,750
men aren't great.
All in all.

2243
01:51:18,751 --> 01:51:19,584
Women aren't great.
You find unique people that are cool in 

2244
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:23,093
all sorts of groups.

2245
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:24,553
Yeah.
And you know,

2246
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,560
once you start aligning yourself with 
one of these groups and you know,

2247
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:33,610
if you ever go against any of their 
principals and you know,

2248
01:51:33,680 --> 01:51:35,960
they're constantly changing and getting 
more extreme,

2249
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:38,840
then you'll eventually get ostracized 
and yeah,

2250
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:39,683
that's what happened.

2251
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:42,830
That that's a big issue with the left.
Sure.

2252
01:51:43,140 --> 01:51:44,650
You know,
left eats itself,

2253
01:51:44,770 --> 01:51:47,980
but I don't think that's as much of an 
issue with the conservative.

2254
01:51:47,981 --> 01:51:48,814
Right?
Rational conservatives not like racists 

2255
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:55,360
and like full right wing nuts.
But you know,

2256
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:56,223
I think

2257
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:59,070
what people just want,

2258
01:51:59,970 --> 01:52:01,570
they,
they want harmony.

2259
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:04,810
I think overall they want to succeed and
they want harmony,

2260
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,760
which sometimes are mutually exclusive.

2261
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:08,340
Yeah.
And you know,

2262
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:09,970
a lot of people just don't acknowledge 
that,

2263
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:12,910
you know,
most people are normal and they're just,

2264
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,090
yeah,
want to live their life and you know,

2265
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:19,180
even though they might have voted for 
trump for something,

2266
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:23,620
they're not some evil person,
they're not the KKK,

2267
01:52:24,190 --> 01:52:25,023
which I've met a lot of people in 
Silicon valley that basically equate 

2268
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:30,950
voting for trump and being in the KKK.
Yeah.

2269
01:52:31,740 --> 01:52:33,250
Yeah,
that's harmful.

2270
01:52:33,251 --> 01:52:36,210
That's really splitting groups.
And you know,

2271
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:39,790
if you're going to build products that 
are for the entire world,

2272
01:52:40,390 --> 01:52:44,020
then you really need to understand other
people especially,

2273
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:44,933
you know,
a lot of the world is actually more 

2274
01:52:47,031 --> 01:52:47,864
conservative than.
I mean Europe may be more liberal than 

2275
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:52,723
the US in some ways,
but a lot of Asia and Africa and South 

2276
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:59,090
America is more conservative than we 
are.

2277
01:52:59,091 --> 01:53:04,091
So we need to at least understand what's
happening and what their worldview is.

2278
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:06,183
Yeah.
The idea that everyone who voted for 

2279
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:08,010
trump is a

2280
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:09,103
in the KKK so crazy,
but it's convenient to demonize the 

2281
01:53:12,951 --> 01:53:15,140
other.
We would love to do that.

2282
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:18,860
We'd love to look at groups and just 
block ourselves off.

2283
01:53:18,861 --> 01:53:19,694
And this is us and we're on the right 
and these people on the other side 

2284
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:26,840
there,
they're incorrect and it's a real normal

2285
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:30,530
common tendency that human beings have 
that we should be very,

2286
01:53:30,531 --> 01:53:32,000
very aware of,
but we're not,

2287
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:32,893
you know,
we have these convenient blinders that 

2288
01:53:34,401 --> 01:53:35,234
we put on whenever we're engaging in a 
sort of ideological discussions where 

2289
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,690
our belief systems might be challenged 
where we dig our heels in and like,

2290
01:53:42,710 --> 01:53:43,543
this is it.
I think you see a lot of that with the 

2291
01:53:45,411 --> 01:53:46,490
left,
with this whole.

2292
01:53:46,491 --> 01:53:47,324
Like you can not be progressive enough.
Like it's like they're getting wackier 

2293
01:53:50,841 --> 01:53:52,850
and whack here with it.
It's just really weird.

2294
01:53:53,590 --> 01:53:54,140
Yeah.
No,

2295
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:56,180
no concept of,
you know,

2296
01:53:56,181 --> 01:53:59,780
okay,
I am an ally with you on this thing,

2297
01:54:00,170 --> 01:54:03,230
even though we may disagree on this 
other subject.

2298
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:06,200
And that's just completely impossible in
their head.

2299
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:07,133
Yeah.
Well I don't think there's enough real 

2300
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:09,833
discussions going on in this world too.
I think people are a lot of times 

2301
01:54:13,261 --> 01:54:15,840
following these predetermined patterns 
of behavior.

2302
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:16,703
They think they're expected to follow as
a progressive or as a conservative and 

2303
01:54:20,581 --> 01:54:21,414
then they just go with it.
And then when they do engage with 

2304
01:54:24,751 --> 01:54:29,670
someone who has a different opinion,
then it becomes a in quotes game again,

2305
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:30,763
it's trying to win rather than trying to
understand like what this person sees 

2306
01:54:35,071 --> 01:54:35,904
and what they think.
And what is your philosophy like how 

2307
01:54:37,711 --> 01:54:40,500
were you approaching this?
And trying to be like really open minded

2308
01:54:40,501 --> 01:54:41,670
about it.
You know,

2309
01:54:41,850 --> 01:54:45,100
like I see this even in myself when I'm 
talking to someone and you know,

2310
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:46,043
maybe there are feminists are like 
extreme in some way and like I'll 

2311
01:54:49,921 --> 01:54:50,754
discuss them and I'll immediately just 
stereotype them as someone that's even 

2312
01:54:53,611 --> 01:54:54,444
more extreme and I'll read into their 
words of Oh you said that that means 

2313
01:54:58,771 --> 01:55:01,620
that you mean this.
And even though you know,

2314
01:55:01,650 --> 01:55:02,483
maybe it's important to at least show 
what the extreme outcome would be and 

2315
01:55:07,381 --> 01:55:10,080
therefore we can't just take this on 
principle.

2316
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:15,180
But you know,
everyone does it and it's really hard to

2317
01:55:15,270 --> 01:55:16,070
not do it.

2318
01:55:16,070 --> 01:55:19,350
It is hard to not do it.
It's one of the reasons why I think like

2319
01:55:19,351 --> 01:55:22,730
long form form conversations are so 
important.

2320
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:23,923
And how often do you ever sit down like 
this with someone and talk for a couple 

2321
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,570
hours with just you and the person 
talking,

2322
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:32,570
not looking at your phone,
not checking the TV?

2323
01:55:32,571 --> 01:55:33,270
Not,
no,

2324
01:55:33,270 --> 01:55:35,240
no.
We were very rarely do this.

2325
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:38,720
I think this is one of the only ways we 
could really work out ideas,

2326
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,823
especially when you're talking to 
someone that might have a different 

2327
01:55:42,071 --> 01:55:42,904
opinion,
but they also might intelligent and you 

2328
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:44,994
might be able to like sort it out.
Let me parse out what your thoughts are 

2329
01:55:48,931 --> 01:55:49,764
and see where I differ and how you got 
to where you got and maybe they'll have 

2330
01:55:53,161 --> 01:55:56,480
a better understanding of your 
philosophy and.

2331
01:55:56,660 --> 01:55:58,770
But there's a lot of people that don't 
even have a philosophy.

2332
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:00,540
It is,
it sounds good.

2333
01:56:00,541 --> 01:56:01,374
So they just go with this predetermined 
pattern that's easy to follow as a left 

2334
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:07,591
wing.
Progressive.

2335
01:56:07,591 --> 01:56:09,180
I feel this,
I mean,

2336
01:56:09,181 --> 01:56:11,130
I've heard people say that before,
like as a Democrat,

2337
01:56:11,131 --> 01:56:12,300
I've always felt like,
oh,

2338
01:56:12,301 --> 01:56:15,690
we as a demo.
How about as a fucking person that's.

2339
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:16,803
No,
it's not.

2340
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:18,763
It's,
um,

2341
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,420
ideas are hard,
you know,

2342
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:22,313
thoughts on life and how we cohabitate 
and how we move through this fucking 

2343
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:30,510
existence together.
It's very difficult to work out.

2344
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:33,840
We were just so many variables,
so many styles of human,

2345
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,093
you know,
there's just so many different things 

2346
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:40,500
that we have to work through together 
and to try to,

2347
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:41,843
to try to do that based on patterns that
other people have established and that 

2348
01:56:45,001 --> 01:56:47,000
you cannot break and then,
you know,

2349
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:48,230
have these.
I mean,

2350
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,073
that's one of the reasons why it's so 
ruthless to say that all white people 

2351
01:56:52,621 --> 01:56:56,220
have some implicit biases that they may 
or not,

2352
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:58,850
may not even be aware of.
And this,

2353
01:56:58,910 --> 01:56:59,743
uh,
you know,

2354
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:01,680
unintended racism,
flavors,

2355
01:57:01,681 --> 01:57:05,790
all conversations like this,
poisoning this conversation,

2356
01:57:05,791 --> 01:57:10,560
you're poisoning this conversation 
within a fucking fishing line.

2357
01:57:10,561 --> 01:57:11,394
It's all tangled up there.
Now we're going to have to figure out 

2358
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:17,100
what is real and pull us apart and get 
it back on the spool.

2359
01:57:17,710 --> 01:57:18,290
No.

2360
01:57:18,290 --> 01:57:19,123
Yeah.
And there's no solution for some of 

2361
01:57:20,421 --> 01:57:21,254
those too where you just say there's 
some boogeyman man type thing that's 

2362
01:57:25,790 --> 01:57:26,623
controlling all of this and there's some
conspiracy that we can't really see and 

2363
01:57:30,591 --> 01:57:34,160
we can't point out specific examples,
but it's ever present.

2364
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:36,800
And I,
I think,

2365
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:38,433
yeah,
a lot of the treating people as 

2366
01:57:39,771 --> 01:57:43,160
individuals that has become more of a 
libertarian thing.

2367
01:57:43,220 --> 01:57:46,910
Yeah.
And so it's hard to,

2368
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:50,990
at least for me to understand some of 
this more collective thinking and social

2369
01:57:50,991 --> 01:57:54,050
conformity,
which I've never been a fan of.

2370
01:57:54,980 --> 01:57:55,813
But

2371
01:57:56,610 --> 01:57:59,670
do you think it was a good idea to write
that memo?

2372
01:57:59,671 --> 01:58:00,504
Like if you had to go back again,
if you were in front of your computer 

2373
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:05,730
and you're ready press,
would you uh,

2374
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:07,730
maybe I would wait for my year end bonus

2375
01:58:12,730 --> 01:58:13,563
man.

2376
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:16,030
I mean I think I would have pushed 
harder,

2377
01:58:16,031 --> 01:58:20,050
even harder on the diversity programs,
although like I met with them personally

2378
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:23,240
and I kept pinging them and I sent so 
many emails.

2379
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:26,860
I'm just trying to have a discussion 
about this.

2380
01:58:27,100 --> 01:58:30,460
And I went through multiple programs and
sent this document,

2381
01:58:30,550 --> 01:58:31,383
this exact document to them.
So it's really unclear what I could've 

2382
01:58:34,630 --> 01:58:37,160
done differently,
but I,

2383
01:58:37,161 --> 01:58:38,050
I,
for example,

2384
01:58:38,051 --> 01:58:38,884
I didn't know so much about the 
underground conservative network before 

2385
01:58:42,791 --> 01:58:45,190
all of this.
At Google you mean?

2386
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:47,110
Yeah.
And even within silicon valley,

2387
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:50,470
like there's attempts to sort of connect
them between companies,

2388
01:58:50,471 --> 01:58:51,304
but there's so much verification that 
you need to go through to be able to 

2389
01:58:55,420 --> 01:58:57,310
join one of these.
You have to have a pseudonym.

2390
01:58:58,110 --> 01:58:58,943
Uh,
I mean you don't need to be totally 

2391
01:59:00,311 --> 01:59:01,990
anonymous,
but you know,

2392
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:02,833
you,
you don't want because there's active 

2393
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:06,490
attempts to try to infiltrate these 
groups.

2394
01:59:06,610 --> 01:59:07,870
Really.
Yeah.

2395
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:09,413
I,
this happens a lot where they'll try to 

2396
01:59:11,441 --> 01:59:15,040
join a group act as if they're one of 
them and then just,

2397
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:15,874
you know,
record what's happening and then expose 

2398
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:18,484
them

2399
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:22,280
and you know,
you can take anything out of context and

2400
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:25,260
it would be shown as you know,
racism or something.

2401
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:26,220
Sure.
What mean.

2402
01:59:26,240 --> 01:59:27,530
Think of what we said,
well,

2403
01:59:27,531 --> 01:59:30,650
not you but me joking around in this 
conversation.

2404
01:59:30,651 --> 01:59:34,820
You could clearly take something I've 
said out of context and make my monster,

2405
01:59:35,390 --> 01:59:39,470
but if you're in an email and you're 
complaining about some sort of diversity

2406
01:59:39,471 --> 01:59:40,304
program.

2407
01:59:41,890 --> 01:59:42,723
Yeah,
like what they often do is they will 

2408
01:59:45,701 --> 01:59:46,534
find someone that they disagree with and
then they'll scour through their entire 

2409
01:59:50,471 --> 01:59:51,304
history at Google and all of the emails 
that they've signed and try to look for 

2410
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:59,590
some way to blacklist them or show that 
this person is evil,

2411
01:59:59,591 --> 02:00:01,140
therefore they should be fired.
Oh,

2412
02:00:01,930 --> 02:00:02,763
it's horrible.
And supposedly this is happening in 

2413
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:05,613
other companies too,
and they even have like these automated 

2414
02:00:07,151 --> 02:00:12,151
scripts to try to find these negative 
things on people that they don't like.

2415
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:14,083
Wow.
So a little little psychological covert 

2416
02:00:17,481 --> 02:00:18,860
warfare.
Yeah.

2417
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:21,470
And that's also going to contribute to 
people towing the line.

2418
02:00:21,471 --> 02:00:23,570
Right.
They don't want to keep their job.

2419
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:25,213
Like look at you just said maybe you 
would have waited until you got your 

2420
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:29,570
year end bonus people.
I mean,

2421
02:00:29,571 --> 02:00:31,190
and you are a single guy,
right?

2422
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:32,043
Yeah.
So family,

2423
02:00:32,240 --> 02:00:35,720
that definitely helped where I don't 
have as many responsibilities.

2424
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:37,010
I imagine if he did,
you know,

2425
02:00:37,011 --> 02:00:39,470
you probably wouldn't have said anything
you had thought about it and go,

2426
02:00:39,471 --> 02:00:40,304
you know what,
I have to worry about my family and 

2427
02:00:41,751 --> 02:00:43,770
taking care of my bills and

2428
02:00:45,820 --> 02:00:47,340
so weird band.
Yeah.

2429
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:48,213
I mean the worst part is these people 
think that they're doing the right 

2430
02:00:50,981 --> 02:00:51,814
thing,
right?

2431
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:56,910
Like censoring people and finding these 
people is the right thing because any of

2432
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:58,750
those people are wrong.
Yeah.

2433
02:00:58,751 --> 02:01:00,520
So that's how they think.
They think,

2434
02:01:00,850 --> 02:01:03,220
okay,
I have everyone sees the world the same.

2435
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:04,233
Therefore anyone that disagrees with me 
is either misinformed or a misogynist 

2436
02:01:08,981 --> 02:01:09,814
bigot.
Right.

2437
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:10,923
Otherwise,
how could I have possibly said those 

2438
02:01:11,951 --> 02:01:12,920
things?
Yeah.

2439
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:15,550
When really,
you know,

2440
02:01:15,551 --> 02:01:16,384
I,
people with different political 

2441
02:01:18,551 --> 02:01:23,551
ideologies see the world differently and
they have different biases and you know,

2442
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:24,963
none of them are totally correct,
but we need to be able to discuss 

2443
02:01:27,431 --> 02:01:29,980
things,
to show,

2444
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,353
you know,
a more objective view of the world 

2445
02:01:34,570 --> 02:01:38,290
without a doubt.
The fact that that is even up for debate

2446
02:01:39,110 --> 02:01:41,090
is a very strange.
I mean,

2447
02:01:41,091 --> 02:01:46,091
that's an ideological echo chamber and 
that seems like for whatever reason that

2448
02:01:47,121 --> 02:01:47,954
seems like where a tech is and that's 
where technology companies seem to lean 

2449
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:55,070
towards this very left wing ideological 
echo chamber.

2450
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:57,073
Yeah.
And I mean I saw it a lot too on the 

2451
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:02,450
comments of a document where I said,
Oh yeah,

2452
02:02:02,451 --> 02:02:04,700
these are just biases.
And no,

2453
02:02:04,701 --> 02:02:05,530
they were like,
no,

2454
02:02:05,530 --> 02:02:06,363
the right is indoctrinated.
They're just KKK and there 

2455
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:13,800
anti-education they're anti poor people.
They're anti everything,

2456
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:15,393
like not all of them.
And yet at least the way I see it and 

2457
02:02:21,631 --> 02:02:22,464
not being,
you know,

2458
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:24,260
total conservative.
I can't necessarily say,

2459
02:02:24,261 --> 02:02:28,160
but it seems like they don't necessarily
hate poor people or anything.

2460
02:02:28,161 --> 02:02:32,930
They just think that these certain 
incentive structures are what's best for

2461
02:02:32,931 --> 02:02:33,764
society and you know,
it's not best to promote or they think 

2462
02:02:37,971 --> 02:02:40,360
that some things will lead to laziness 
or something.

2463
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:43,040
And that's not saying,
Oh yeah,

2464
02:02:43,041 --> 02:02:47,360
these people are just horrible people.
They actually want to help everyone.

2465
02:02:47,361 --> 02:02:49,420
And they think that these,
uh,

2466
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,180
social norms and government programs may
be hurting people.

2467
02:02:53,530 --> 02:02:54,363
Yeah,
I mean there certainly are some people 

2468
02:02:55,691 --> 02:02:56,524
that are right wing that think like that
and then there's some people that are 

2469
02:02:58,031 --> 02:02:59,830
right wing that are really racist.
Yeah.

2470
02:02:59,831 --> 02:03:00,664
And they,
they exist too and there's some people 

2471
02:03:01,811 --> 02:03:04,900
that are left wing that are really 
racist and they're really racist towards

2472
02:03:04,901 --> 02:03:05,740
white people.
I mean,

2473
02:03:05,741 --> 02:03:06,574
that's,
that's there's white people that are 

2474
02:03:07,151 --> 02:03:08,770
racist towards white people.
I mean,

2475
02:03:08,771 --> 02:03:11,620
I've read so many fucking tweets from 
people that,

2476
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:12,780
you know,
like I've,

2477
02:03:12,780 --> 02:03:17,780
I follow a bunch of anti social justice 
warrior accounts and they'll find people

2478
02:03:18,971 --> 02:03:22,300
that tweet like really horrible shit 
about white people that are white.

2479
02:03:23,210 --> 02:03:26,890
It's like I get what you're doing,
just try to get those Brownie points,

2480
02:03:27,310 --> 02:03:31,060
trying to try super hard to get people 
of color to love you.

2481
02:03:31,510 --> 02:03:33,160
And you know,
as an ally,

2482
02:03:33,340 --> 02:03:34,173
it's just very strange time.
I think a lot of it has to do with this 

2483
02:03:37,721 --> 02:03:41,080
new found ability to communicate that 
just really did not exist in the past.

2484
02:03:41,410 --> 02:03:43,750
If you wanted to get controversial ideas
past,

2485
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:45,400
uh,
you know,

2486
02:03:45,850 --> 02:03:48,760
two massive groups of people in the 
past,

2487
02:03:48,761 --> 02:03:51,220
you had to write a book or you had to 
get an article published,

2488
02:03:51,221 --> 02:03:55,690
you had to be some sort of a major media
distribution center,

2489
02:03:55,691 --> 02:03:59,140
had to take your work and put it out 
there for the people.

2490
02:03:59,530 --> 02:04:01,600
Now that's not the case,
so now you get a lot of,

2491
02:04:01,601 --> 02:04:06,310
like really fragile or really poorly 
thought out ideas and uh,

2492
02:04:06,340 --> 02:04:09,520
as long as you can hit the nerve of 
enough retards,

2493
02:04:09,550 --> 02:04:12,760
you can get those things out.
And then they start promoting.

2494
02:04:12,761 --> 02:04:13,594
I mean,
that's where the flat earth movement is 

2495
02:04:14,291 --> 02:04:16,210
coming from.
What does that,

2496
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:17,410
other than that,
I mean,

2497
02:04:17,411 --> 02:04:18,244
that's exactly what it is.
It's enough people that just don't have 

2498
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:24,693
a sense of the importance of critical 
thinking skills or are not used to 

2499
02:04:28,730 --> 02:04:30,640
objectives,
assessing ideas.

2500
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:31,773
And then they,
they coalesce in these groups that are 

2501
02:04:33,851 --> 02:04:36,340
likeminded and you can get that with 
racism.

2502
02:04:36,580 --> 02:04:37,860
You can get that with sexism.

2503
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,660
You can get that with pretty much 
anything,

2504
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:41,610
right?
You get these likeminded groups,

2505
02:04:41,730 --> 02:04:42,563
they get together and they have 
confirmation bias and they get an 

2506
02:04:45,121 --> 02:04:48,480
ideological echo chamber and they start 
reinforcing each other,

2507
02:04:48,510 --> 02:04:49,070
you know?

2508
02:04:49,070 --> 02:04:52,100
Yeah,
and definitely.

2509
02:04:52,101 --> 02:04:54,830
I mean it affects who you follow and you
just assume,

2510
02:04:54,831 --> 02:04:56,780
oh yeah,
everyone thinks like this,

2511
02:04:56,781 --> 02:04:57,920
therefore it must be.
Right.

2512
02:04:58,070 --> 02:05:00,890
Yeah,
and I mean it's really a shame though,

2513
02:05:00,891 --> 02:05:01,724
that this is happening even in the 
pursuit of knowledge in academia where 

2514
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:09,230
so many people,
how a certain worldview,

2515
02:05:09,530 --> 02:05:12,470
like the social sciences have 90 percent
of people lean left.

2516
02:05:12,590 --> 02:05:15,110
Yeah.
And that's,

2517
02:05:15,560 --> 02:05:16,393
that can create its own confirmation 
biases and especially when you know 

2518
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:21,713
it's,
it's definitely bad like in tech where 

2519
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:26,540
20 percent of people are women and they 
can feel alienated,

2520
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:31,870
but at least no overt signs of sexism 
are seen as bad.

2521
02:05:32,170 --> 02:05:35,900
Right.
But over signs of discriminating against

2522
02:05:35,901 --> 02:05:36,734
people based on their political 
orientation is seen as okay and people 

2523
02:05:41,090 --> 02:05:44,150
do it.
And so yeah,

2524
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:49,200
there's a big asymmetry there where you 
actually feel it's justified to.

2525
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:50,793
Maybe it wouldn't be as big of an issue 
if we had a reasonable republican 

2526
02:05:54,011 --> 02:05:54,844
president.
Maybe if we had someone who was really 

2527
02:05:57,371 --> 02:05:58,204
kind and rational,
Mitt Romney type who seemed like far 

2528
02:06:01,721 --> 02:06:04,590
more reasonable and you know,
it's

2529
02:06:06,890 --> 02:06:07,760
sort of,

2530
02:06:08,730 --> 02:06:09,490
you know,
I mean,

2531
02:06:09,490 --> 02:06:11,820
wow,
we have a bunch of issues obviously as a

2532
02:06:11,821 --> 02:06:16,821
country now with this guy is president 
and I think that we're also dealing with

2533
02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:18,063
a really young,
an infant stage of information 

2534
02:06:22,231 --> 02:06:23,850
distribution.
Like a,

2535
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:28,260
the ability for anyone to mass 
distribute anything is.

2536
02:06:28,270 --> 02:06:31,820
So like anyone can create a,
a,

2537
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:35,490
you know,
a youtube video and if it strikes a cord

2538
02:06:35,670 --> 02:06:39,870
it can hit a million people like that 
this time like that before where,

2539
02:06:39,871 --> 02:06:41,040
you know,
I mean,

2540
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,803
and the incentive structures are all out
of whack where it's better to be 

2541
02:06:45,521 --> 02:06:46,354
outrageous than it is to be honest.
And that that's causing a lot of our 

2542
02:06:51,911 --> 02:06:53,200
headlines to just be,
you know,

2543
02:06:53,201 --> 02:06:54,034
oh,
he starts a sexist and there's no room 

2544
02:06:57,701 --> 02:06:58,540
for nuance,

2545
02:06:58,730 --> 02:07:00,110
but it'll also don't,
you think that it's,

2546
02:07:00,230 --> 02:07:01,063
there's a lack of time that people have.
Just like I told you how much time I 

2547
02:07:04,311 --> 02:07:07,820
spent going over your stuff.
And and after awhile I was like,

2548
02:07:07,821 --> 02:07:09,860
what the fuck am I doing?
I think it would work in tech,

2549
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:15,260
but most people don't have that kind of 
time.

2550
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:17,450
Nor do they have that sort of obsessive 
mindset.

2551
02:07:17,451 --> 02:07:19,400
They look at the surface of something,
oh,

2552
02:07:19,401 --> 02:07:22,940
this guy wrote a sexist memo about women
in tech.

2553
02:07:22,941 --> 02:07:25,160
Fuck him.
It's probably a misogynist,

2554
02:07:25,161 --> 02:07:29,390
and they just marched towards their 
meeting and we have to avoid the kind of

2555
02:07:29,391 --> 02:07:30,224
thinking that lead to someone thinking 
that it's okay to write the Google memo 

2556
02:07:33,380 --> 02:07:35,030
and then everyone like,
yes,

2557
02:07:35,240 --> 02:07:36,073
here I want my year end bonus.
I think as the dust settles we will get 

2558
02:07:44,650 --> 02:07:49,650
more and more truth out of people.
And I think there's a general trend with

2559
02:07:50,650 --> 02:07:55,650
information to,
to have information be easier and easier

2560
02:07:55,841 --> 02:07:56,590
to distribute.

2561
02:07:56,590 --> 02:07:58,570
That's the one of the most important 
things about technology,

2562
02:07:58,571 --> 02:07:59,404
right?
They're instantaneous access to 

2563
02:08:00,401 --> 02:08:05,140
information and right now that 
information is not entirely verifiable.

2564
02:08:05,260 --> 02:08:06,093
Like some of it is and some of it's not.
And that's one of the more disturbing 

2565
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:12,760
things about people reprinting your memo
without citations.

2566
02:08:12,761 --> 02:08:13,600
I was like,
Hey,

2567
02:08:14,050 --> 02:08:14,883
like you fuckers,
you left out a big part of what this is 

2568
02:08:18,110 --> 02:08:19,810
like,
what you did is really wrong.

2569
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:22,150
Um,
those citations,

2570
02:08:22,151 --> 02:08:26,080
maybe people won't go into them.
Maybe they won't read the studies.

2571
02:08:26,081 --> 02:08:26,914
Maybe they won't let me,
it takes a long time if you really want 

2572
02:08:28,301 --> 02:08:29,134
to get involved in that,
but there will be a better version of 

2573
02:08:32,051 --> 02:08:34,600
that in the future of.
I think they will.

2574
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:35,900
I think.
I think that's where the,

2575
02:08:35,901 --> 02:08:39,400
I mean obviously I don't know,
but I think that's where the trend is.

2576
02:08:39,401 --> 02:08:40,234
I think the trend is leaning towards 
more and more honest interpretation of 

2577
02:08:43,601 --> 02:08:47,350
facts and ideas and then you know,
we'll be left with some,

2578
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:48,653
some things that we have to look at that
we can't just write off to sociology or 

2579
02:08:51,221 --> 02:08:56,221
write off to culture or off to biases or
sexism or racism.

2580
02:08:56,630 --> 02:09:00,040
We're going to have to look at things 
for what they really are and maybe we'll

2581
02:09:00,041 --> 02:09:04,330
have a better understanding of why we 
behave the way we do,

2582
02:09:04,331 --> 02:09:05,770
why we have the problems that we have.

2583
02:09:06,710 --> 02:09:07,543
Yeah.
And part of the issue though is if 

2584
02:09:10,021 --> 02:09:15,021
someone controls the access to 
information and they want a certain area

2585
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:18,690
to be told,
then you know,

2586
02:09:18,770 --> 02:09:23,770
it'll really color what people see.
And that's what's scary.

2587
02:09:24,451 --> 02:09:25,284
And you know,
we see this a lot on youtube now where 

2588
02:09:27,361 --> 02:09:28,194
they're demonetizing anyone that they 
see as right wing and no even censoring 

2589
02:09:32,761 --> 02:09:36,030
and removing videos.
It's really scary.

2590
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:37,080
It is.
Yeah.

2591
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:39,660
It's fascinating.
I mean it's,

2592
02:09:39,661 --> 02:09:40,381
it's,
uh,

2593
02:09:40,381 --> 02:09:41,214
it's,
it's quite fascinating to watch it all 

2594
02:09:42,541 --> 02:09:45,960
play out and to have them do it like 
right in front of everybody's face.

2595
02:09:45,961 --> 02:09:49,200
And everybody goes,
what are you doing like you are,

2596
02:09:49,260 --> 02:09:52,380
you're changing narratives.
You're altering information.

2597
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:57,330
And they feel like they are right.
They're doing the right thing.

2598
02:09:57,331 --> 02:09:58,164
They're promoting diversity.
They're promoting liberal values and 

2599
02:10:01,801 --> 02:10:04,740
progressive ideas and they think they're
doing the right thing.

2600
02:10:05,590 --> 02:10:07,110
Don't necessarily think they're right 
though,

2601
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:09,750
you know,
it's just a lot of blow back though.

2602
02:10:10,050 --> 02:10:11,010
I mean,
this is not free.

2603
02:10:11,040 --> 02:10:14,070
It's not free ride for Google right now 
with what they've done to you.

2604
02:10:14,071 --> 02:10:16,680
I mean,
I'm sure there's been,

2605
02:10:16,770 --> 02:10:17,603
I mean,
I'm sure they're doubling down because 

2606
02:10:18,961 --> 02:10:20,310
they don't want to admit they're fucked 
up.

2607
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:21,173
If they admit they're fucked up,
everybody across the board loses that 

2608
02:10:24,510 --> 02:10:26,310
year end bonus becomes a real issue,
right?

2609
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:28,620
Everybody gets fired.
But if they,

2610
02:10:28,621 --> 02:10:30,440
uh,
you know,

2611
02:10:30,510 --> 02:10:33,210
if you look at it long term over the 
long run,

2612
02:10:33,220 --> 02:10:37,550
I mean they have definitely taken a hit 
and if someone forces them to sit down,

2613
02:10:37,551 --> 02:10:41,270
I would love to sit down with the guy 
who said that you promote harmful gender

2614
02:10:41,300 --> 02:10:43,330
stereotypes and go,
let's go,

2615
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:45,950
let's go to this thing.
Step by step.

2616
02:10:45,951 --> 02:10:48,680
You tell me what's wrong and just pick 
them apart.

2617
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:52,550
That's what I've always wanted.
But he'll fall apart 100 percent.

2618
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:56,000
I just say a bunch of stupid social 
justice warrior bullshit.

2619
02:10:56,210 --> 02:10:59,120
And if you just keep them in a room for 
three hours of the microphone,

2620
02:10:59,360 --> 02:11:01,940
it's going to look like a fucking idiot.
Just no way around it.

2621
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:04,100
You know?
There's no way around it.

2622
02:11:04,101 --> 02:11:04,934
If you're just active,
if you actually going off of what you 

2623
02:11:07,701 --> 02:11:08,534
wrote to somehow or another,
I think it's very not just dangerous to 

2624
02:11:13,281 --> 02:11:15,440
say it promotes harmful gender 
stereotypes.

2625
02:11:15,710 --> 02:11:17,840
It's disingenuous.
And why?

2626
02:11:17,900 --> 02:11:22,130
The reason why it's dangerous is because
I could just read what that guy said and

2627
02:11:22,131 --> 02:11:24,650
I would think that you're a creep and 
that's dangerous to you.

2628
02:11:25,390 --> 02:11:29,570
It's dangerous towards the marketplace 
of free ideas.

2629
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,153
The marketplace of ideas is extremely 
important and I would think that if 

2630
02:11:34,881 --> 02:11:37,730
anybody would know that it would be the 
people that are involved in tech,

2631
02:11:38,450 --> 02:11:39,550
you would think so?
Yeah.

2632
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:40,393
I mean they're just so wrapped up just 
so wrapped up in the progressive 

2633
02:11:44,571 --> 02:11:45,404
mindset.

2634
02:11:46,030 --> 02:11:46,863
It's weird,
man.

2635
02:11:47,210 --> 02:11:50,020
It's circulated to all this 
microaggression.

2636
02:11:50,620 --> 02:11:54,940
Speech is violence and yeah,
all ideas are harmful and,

2637
02:11:55,750 --> 02:11:56,583
and of course some ideas are harmful,
but it's only through openly discussing 

2638
02:12:02,621 --> 02:12:03,454
them.
Can you actually dispel some of these 

2639
02:12:04,751 --> 02:12:07,170
things by making them,
you know,

2640
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:11,390
forbidding knowledge that's only going 
to attract certain people and you know,

2641
02:12:11,410 --> 02:12:12,243
we even see this now worth some of the 
youtube videos that are in this 

2642
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:21,430
purgatory type state where you know,
you can't really get to them,

2643
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:22,953
but if you know the url,
you can still find that people are 

2644
02:12:26,261 --> 02:12:31,261
getting aggregated lists of those and 
actually viewing them and oh,

2645
02:12:32,021 --> 02:12:34,000
this is what youtube doesn't want us to 
see.

2646
02:12:34,090 --> 02:12:37,330
Maybe there's some truth to it.
Why don't they want them to see it?

2647
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:38,883
Yeah.

2648
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:40,733
If you win a certain amount of money,
are you willing to buy a gold plated 

2649
02:12:43,471 --> 02:12:45,750
Ferrari and drive around with a fur 
coat?

2650
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:50,250
Because I think that Kinda Shit.
Big Ass crazy sunglasses,

2651
02:12:51,190 --> 02:12:54,640
a win.

2652
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:58,070
I don't really know.
And I mean I'm trying to.

2653
02:12:59,240 --> 02:13:02,690
I mean what I would ideally want and 
somehow changing their policies,

2654
02:13:02,900 --> 02:13:03,733
but I don't really know how I as an 
individual can compel google to do 

2655
02:13:07,101 --> 02:13:07,934
something like that.
But I think at least some of the stuff 

2656
02:13:10,401 --> 02:13:14,330
like the blacklisting where they have 
these people that,

2657
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:15,513
you know,
compile these spreadsheets of names of 

2658
02:13:17,451 --> 02:13:21,860
people that are conservative or even 
Libertarian and Oh,

2659
02:13:22,040 --> 02:13:22,873
we're not going to work with them,
we're going to sabotage their work and 

2660
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:28,310
we're going to try to get them fired 
when they are looking for another job.

2661
02:13:28,311 --> 02:13:31,980
We're going to share this list so they 
can't get hired from any of the

2662
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,400
other major companies like that needs 
to.

2663
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:35,310
That's real.
Yeah.

2664
02:13:35,311 --> 02:13:36,290
That's real.
How do you know that?

2665
02:13:36,390 --> 02:13:38,280
That's real to have you seen this list 
yet?

2666
02:13:38,490 --> 02:13:42,690
So there've been multiple people that 
have admitted to having a blacklist.

2667
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:44,990
Wow.
I libertarian,

2668
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:48,610
not even conservative,
not even right wing,

2669
02:13:48,730 --> 02:13:51,310
but smaller government libertarian.

2670
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:53,620
Yeah.
Just because,

2671
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:54,593
I mean it's generally free thinking,
people not telling the party line and 

2672
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:05,160
those people get blacklisted really.
If there's an actual list somewhere.

2673
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:10,360
I think if you've seen an actual list.
I haven't seen an individual list.

2674
02:14:10,610 --> 02:14:13,210
I think there's multiple lists spread 
out,

2675
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:18,170
but people even like high up managers 
have admitted to having a car,

2676
02:14:18,370 --> 02:14:19,910
a blacklist.
Wow.

2677
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:20,853
And you know,
we have brought this up to the highest 

2678
02:14:22,721 --> 02:14:25,930
people at Google and they just 
completely dismissed it,

2679
02:14:25,990 --> 02:14:27,790
like we're not going to deal with it.

2680
02:14:27,890 --> 02:14:28,723
So do you feel like they feel that they 
have some sort of a social 

2681
02:14:30,831 --> 02:14:31,664
responsibility to push progressive 
values because they're in this massive 

2682
02:14:34,791 --> 02:14:38,210
position of influence and they feel like
that's the right way to think.

2683
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:40,910
So they're going to go full steam ahead.

2684
02:14:41,790 --> 02:14:43,680
Yeah.
And don't be evil.

2685
02:14:43,740 --> 02:14:48,270
Don't be conservative.
Pretty much the libertarian man.

2686
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:49,523
Boy,
so fucking tough sell to say that Gary 

2687
02:14:52,260 --> 02:14:53,820
Johnson's evil,
you know?

2688
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:57,800
I don't know.
But yeah,

2689
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:00,113
it's,
it's really hard to understand that 

2690
02:15:02,761 --> 02:15:04,840
mindset.
But yeah,

2691
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:06,133
I get it though because I think it's a 
lot of the same things along the same 

2692
02:15:09,171 --> 02:15:12,110
lines that you were talking about when 
you were saying that you didn't,

2693
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:13,273
you know,
like maybe you would have waited till 

2694
02:15:14,571 --> 02:15:19,370
you got your year end bonus and you're a
guy who is also a frugal.

2695
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:20,233
You've saved your money and you don't 
have a family to support and you're 

2696
02:15:23,061 --> 02:15:24,110
okay.
You know,

2697
02:15:24,111 --> 02:15:26,350
you got fired and you're still okay.
You know.

2698
02:15:26,420 --> 02:15:28,310
Whereas some people will be fucked right
now.

2699
02:15:28,311 --> 02:15:30,750
Maybe they'd be over extended,
maybe they have that goal,

2700
02:15:30,751 --> 02:15:33,860
Ferrari and the fur coat and shit.
Yeah,

2701
02:15:33,861 --> 02:15:37,280
I mean if I had a mortgage or something 
scary,

2702
02:15:37,490 --> 02:15:38,323
that's where it gets scary.
That's a lot of people's decision 

2703
02:15:39,801 --> 02:15:40,760
making.
I mean that's,

2704
02:15:41,180 --> 02:15:42,013
that goes back to you know,
engineering civilization and the early 

2705
02:15:46,640 --> 02:15:48,620
days of Rome.
I think there was writings about that,

2706
02:15:48,621 --> 02:15:52,520
about getting people to commit to 
families and it's easier to control them

2707
02:15:52,521 --> 02:15:54,830
when they have other ones and,
and you know,

2708
02:15:55,190 --> 02:15:56,023
and things that they enjoy and positions
of power and status that it's easier to 

2709
02:15:59,601 --> 02:16:03,200
get those people to give into your needs
and desires.

2710
02:16:03,201 --> 02:16:04,820
Yeah,
I mean it makes sense,

2711
02:16:04,821 --> 02:16:05,654
right?
I mean it's just engineering a 

2712
02:16:07,041 --> 02:16:07,874
civilization.
It's one of the like getting people to 

2713
02:16:11,960 --> 02:16:12,793
perform and behave the way that you 
would like them to is a critical 

2714
02:16:16,071 --> 02:16:16,904
component of engineering.
Any sort of civilization and is 

2715
02:16:20,360 --> 02:16:23,120
essentially a civilization if you look 
at it that way.

2716
02:16:23,150 --> 02:16:25,580
I mean internally there's a is a 
community.

2717
02:16:25,581 --> 02:16:26,414
It's a structure and their engineering 
that structured to be very a likeminded 

2718
02:16:31,840 --> 02:16:33,520
ideological echo chamber

2719
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:37,550
and I think it's really going to bite 
them in the back at some point,

2720
02:16:37,570 --> 02:16:42,570
like they're making the easy decision of
not really facing the,

2721
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:46,250
you know,
the truth as I see it.

2722
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:49,760
And you know,
if you turn your back on that for too,

2723
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:50,773
too long,
it's really going to have negative 

2724
02:16:52,941 --> 02:16:54,020
consequences later.

2725
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:55,970
Yeah.
Well I,

2726
02:16:55,971 --> 02:16:58,630
I feel like one thing it's super 
important to point out,

2727
02:16:58,631 --> 02:17:02,290
I think we kind of already did,
but women do experience a lot of sexism.

2728
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:03,520
And again,
it's because like I said,

2729
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:04,960
men are gross.
You know,

2730
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:10,010
there's a lot of gross men and men 
working in close proximity with women.

2731
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:11,783
I mean men working with other men,
they're going to find things they don't 

2732
02:17:14,381 --> 02:17:15,760
like about those men.
Yeah,

2733
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:17,033
I mean people have interpersonal 
relationships are fucking gross and 

2734
02:17:19,541 --> 02:17:20,374
messy and if men work with women and 
they feel like they can dominate them 

2735
02:17:23,741 --> 02:17:24,574
with aggression or with some sort of 
weird tactics that play on the 

2736
02:17:29,111 --> 02:17:32,360
agreeableness,
females tend to have the,

2737
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:33,000
you know,
it's,

2738
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:36,340
it's a problem.
And I think by not looking at it that by

2739
02:17:36,341 --> 02:17:40,330
not being honest about that,
we do just as much as of a disservice.

2740
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:41,433
Yeah.
Although,

2741
02:17:41,570 --> 02:17:42,403
I mean,
I would say that there are men that are 

2742
02:17:44,321 --> 02:17:47,630
just as agreeable and just as much of a 
pushover say yeah,

2743
02:17:47,631 --> 02:17:48,464
sure.
And they also get a Shandan aside and 

2744
02:17:53,441 --> 02:17:54,274
sometimes it's even worse for men that 
fit that stereotype or don't fit the 

2745
02:17:58,420 --> 02:18:01,030
typical male stereotype because you 
know,

2746
02:18:01,031 --> 02:18:01,864
there's negative consequences on both 
sides for not being masculine if you're 

2747
02:18:06,101 --> 02:18:09,280
a man or not being feminine enough if 
you're a woman.

2748
02:18:09,510 --> 02:18:10,343
Yeah.
Like you're not allowed to just be 

2749
02:18:11,461 --> 02:18:12,360
yourself.
Right?

2750
02:18:12,361 --> 02:18:14,670
You have to like fit why you're better 
off.

2751
02:18:14,671 --> 02:18:16,680
You fit into some sort of a classic 
narrative.

2752
02:18:17,190 --> 02:18:20,250
Yeah.
So where do you go from here?

2753
02:18:20,340 --> 02:18:22,200
Besides sue?
In the form of Google.

2754
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:23,753
Google.
Just give them some money to shut him 

2755
02:18:25,111 --> 02:18:25,944
out.
Do you want to go through with a 

2756
02:18:27,301 --> 02:18:28,134
lawsuit?
Like what if they came to you with a 

2757
02:18:28,561 --> 02:18:29,394
settlement?
Would you just take it and shut your 

2758
02:18:29,971 --> 02:18:30,780
mouth?

2759
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:31,613
I don't.
I really want somehow for them to 

2760
02:18:33,911 --> 02:18:36,280
address it,
but I don't know how to do

2761
02:18:37,170 --> 02:18:38,370
well.
Even if they,

2762
02:18:38,371 --> 02:18:40,560
if you lose in court,
will they address it?

2763
02:18:40,561 --> 02:18:41,800
They'll probably say,
you know,

2764
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:42,673
although we support the court,
we disagree with the rulings and we 

2765
02:18:44,251 --> 02:18:48,790
still support gender equality and yet,

2766
02:18:49,430 --> 02:18:50,263
I mean,
I think part of it is that there is 

2767
02:18:51,111 --> 02:18:51,944
currently an asymmetry.
So maybe Google is acting in their best 

2768
02:18:54,291 --> 02:18:58,370
interest to act the way that they are 
because they think that,

2769
02:18:58,610 --> 02:18:59,443
you know,
there's all these activists that are 

2770
02:19:00,291 --> 02:19:05,291
trying to attack Google that only if 
they don't fit this summer.

2771
02:19:05,550 --> 02:19:08,030
Are there a lot of activists that are 
attacking Google in that regard?

2772
02:19:08,130 --> 02:19:08,980
Yeah.
And you know,

2773
02:19:09,030 --> 02:19:09,863
we even see that there's now a potential
class action lawsuit against Google 

2774
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:16,013
about war,
a gender pay disparity and so like they 

2775
02:19:19,921 --> 02:19:20,754
just are looking for anything.
And if we say that if there's only 

2776
02:19:25,201 --> 02:19:26,034
incentive coming from one side,
then only going to push farther and 

2777
02:19:28,221 --> 02:19:29,054
farther to that side.
And this gender pay disparity is just 

2778
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:37,900
involving similar jobs yet.
So they claim that it's the same job.

2779
02:19:38,391 --> 02:19:42,680
Although at least when Google was doing 
their own internal analysis,

2780
02:19:42,681 --> 02:19:47,330
which they've been doing for years,
they show that there's no disparity once

2781
02:19:47,331 --> 02:19:52,331
you control for pay for performance,
and so it's really unclear and,

2782
02:19:55,920 --> 02:19:59,260
but you control for performance 
performance tends to favor

2783
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:01,290
males.
Maybe I if,

2784
02:20:01,530 --> 02:20:02,363
if that's what they're showing,
that there is some sort of gender 

2785
02:20:04,351 --> 02:20:05,790
disparity.
If you just look at aggregate,

2786
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:08,880
look at this one in $100,
million chance,

2787
02:20:08,881 --> 02:20:12,270
alleged gender pay gap at Google is 
random.

2788
02:20:12,450 --> 02:20:13,283
Says class action lawyer.
Oh Jesus class action lawyer says that 

2789
02:20:16,981 --> 02:20:21,450
in the article is written by a chick 
fake fake news.

2790
02:20:21,451 --> 02:20:22,920
You're not going to get me.
You fucks.

2791
02:20:23,110 --> 02:20:26,710
I think one thing is I don't think that 
they really have Google's internal data,

2792
02:20:26,711 --> 02:20:30,880
so there's no way for them to say 
whether or not it's based on performance

2793
02:20:31,450 --> 02:20:32,950
liquid there.
They're saying here,

2794
02:20:33,250 --> 02:20:34,083
you know,

2795
02:20:36,010 --> 02:20:41,010
notices seeking women currently or 
formerly employed at Google for possible

2796
02:20:41,351 --> 02:20:44,460
inclusion in a planned class action 
lawsuit.

2797
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:46,660
First of all,
people hear that and they're like,

2798
02:20:46,870 --> 02:20:48,560
we're going to get paid.
Well,

2799
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:50,710
go Sizzla,
right?

2800
02:20:51,340 --> 02:20:52,173
I mean,
that's just.

2801
02:20:52,390 --> 02:20:53,223
You're playing on human instincts when 
you seek out people that may have been 

2802
02:20:57,341 --> 02:21:00,910
employed for a possible inclusion in a 
class action lawsuit.

2803
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:03,670
That's not saying that they weren't 
wronged because I don't obviously,

2804
02:21:03,671 --> 02:21:04,504
I don't know,
several dozen came forward in a matter 

2805
02:21:06,641 --> 02:21:07,474
of weeks.
That's a pretty high level of 

2806
02:21:08,501 --> 02:21:10,990
dissatisfaction.
Says James Feinberg.

2807
02:21:11,140 --> 02:21:11,980
No,
it's not.

2808
02:21:12,430 --> 02:21:13,263
No,
there's fucking thousands of people 

2809
02:21:14,471 --> 02:21:16,990
who've worked there and a couple dozen 
came forward.

2810
02:21:17,170 --> 02:21:18,003
That's not a high level of satisfaction.
How many people have been employed at 

2811
02:21:20,291 --> 02:21:25,030
Google that are no longer employed?
It's probably tens of thousands,

2812
02:21:25,360 --> 02:21:25,770
right?

2813
02:21:25,770 --> 02:21:27,330
Yeah.
There's 70,000

2814
02:21:27,331 --> 02:21:27,940
people here.

2815
02:21:27,940 --> 02:21:29,860
Okay,
so for this guy to say,

2816
02:21:29,861 --> 02:21:34,660
that's a pretty high level of 
dissatisfaction when several dozen,

2817
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:37,270
let's say three dozen.
Let's go crazy.

2818
02:21:37,420 --> 02:21:39,910
Let's say it's 40 people.
Let's get nuts.

2819
02:21:40,270 --> 02:21:43,210
That's fucking nobody man.
Oh,

2820
02:21:43,211 --> 02:21:45,820
70 women.
It's biggest heard from.

2821
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:49,930
But wait a minute,
hurt from it doesn't mean they might not

2822
02:21:49,931 --> 02:21:54,931
even make sense.
That might not be a case for four people

2823
02:21:57,520 --> 02:21:59,890
for.
That's not a lot.

2824
02:21:59,891 --> 02:22:03,250
You fuck the class action.
I mean that's just.

2825
02:22:03,550 --> 02:22:04,383
This is.
This is a fucking ambulance chaser 

2826
02:22:06,130 --> 02:22:06,920
Chaser,
right?

2827
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:08,890
I mean,
I'm not saying he's wrong,

2828
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:12,100
I'm not saying there's not sexual 
discrimination,

2829
02:22:12,101 --> 02:22:14,630
but I'm saying like this,
these articles are sneaky as fuck shock

2830
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,400
for people.
You got four people and I don't know how

2831
02:22:17,401 --> 02:22:18,234
an individual would know whether or not 
they're paid differently just based on 

2832
02:22:22,501 --> 02:22:23,281
their sex.
Right?

2833
02:22:23,281 --> 02:22:24,930
Because there's so many variables at 
play,

2834
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:26,153
so you really have to look at the system
as a whole because I mean there are 

2835
02:22:30,301 --> 02:22:31,134
definitely some men that are paid less 
than the women too for performance was 

2836
02:22:34,951 --> 02:22:35,550
like that.

2837
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:37,440
The problem is when you control for 
performance,

2838
02:22:37,441 --> 02:22:38,274
if it turns out that men are being paid 
more than you have to figure out some 

2839
02:22:41,281 --> 02:22:44,000
sort of a way to justify that.
Or you know,

2840
02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:48,570
like if men are being paid more when you
control for performance,

2841
02:22:49,140 --> 02:22:52,050
what is it that's causing the men to be 
paid more?

2842
02:22:52,051 --> 02:22:52,884
Why are they performing better because 
of the environment they feel more 

2843
02:22:55,171 --> 02:22:58,020
comfortable.
Is it lack of suppression that the women

2844
02:22:58,021 --> 02:22:58,854
experience like.

2845
02:22:59,390 --> 02:23:00,223
Yeah.
So I guess when you look at the 

2846
02:23:02,011 --> 02:23:02,844
nationwide gender gap in pay where you 
know even Obama has said seventy seven 

2847
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:08,280
cents per dollar is too little.

2848
02:23:08,340 --> 02:23:10,170
Yeah,
but he's a silly person.

2849
02:23:10,171 --> 02:23:11,840
Like I shouldn't have done that.
Like he,

2850
02:23:11,870 --> 02:23:14,130
he knows.
Like when Obama said that,

2851
02:23:14,131 --> 02:23:14,964
he knows that that's not being honest 
because you're talking about completely 

2852
02:23:18,091 --> 02:23:21,060
different jobs,
different choices for people don't know.

2853
02:23:21,090 --> 02:23:22,620
Okay,
let's just break that down real quick.

2854
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:23,513
This thing,
because people repeated ad nauseum and 

2855
02:23:25,351 --> 02:23:26,184
it's just not true.
The gender pay gap of seventy seven 

2856
02:23:29,610 --> 02:23:33,930
cents to a dollar that a male makes is 
based on the choices that people make as

2857
02:23:33,931 --> 02:23:34,764
far as like what they do for a living.
It's based on the amount of hours that 

2858
02:23:37,921 --> 02:23:40,080
they work.
Men tend to work longer hours.

2859
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:42,300
Women tend,
especially if they get pregnant.

2860
02:23:42,570 --> 02:23:46,500
All those things are factored in.
That's where you get seventy seven cents

2861
02:23:46,650 --> 02:23:49,200
on average for the dollar that the male 
makes.

2862
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:50,333
What it implies,
and this is where it's disingenuous 

2863
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,003
because it two people working side by 
side doing the same job and the males 

2864
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:59,760
getting 77 more a dollar for the woman's
seventy seven cents.

2865
02:23:59,850 --> 02:24:03,270
That's not what the gender pay gap 
actually means.

2866
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:04,583
And if Google is actually,
if someone is saying if there's a 

2867
02:24:08,071 --> 02:24:08,904
lawsuit that's saying that a man and a 
woman are doing the exact same job with 

2868
02:24:12,601 --> 02:24:13,434
the exact same performance and the woman
is only getting seventy seven cents on 

2869
02:24:17,041 --> 02:24:18,750
the dollar,
then you got a real issue.

2870
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:19,170
Right?

2871
02:24:19,170 --> 02:24:24,170
Yeah.
And so it's often or that you know,

2872
02:24:24,400 --> 02:24:28,560
there's different hours worked and it 
doesn't even have to be that,

2873
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:29,553
you know,
they work twice as many or 30 percent 

2874
02:24:31,651 --> 02:24:36,570
more.
It's sometimes if you just work 44 hours

2875
02:24:36,571 --> 02:24:40,860
a week versus 34 hours or something,
then there's a huge,

2876
02:24:40,940 --> 02:24:42,410
a pay disparity.
Yeah.

2877
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:45,270
And that's irrespective of what gender 
you have.

2878
02:24:45,330 --> 02:24:48,720
It's just,
especially at Google,

2879
02:24:48,990 --> 02:24:51,560
there was so much time that was just,
you know,

2880
02:24:51,570 --> 02:24:54,900
replying to email and doing some base 
level stuff,

2881
02:24:54,901 --> 02:24:55,734
going to meetings and then you only had 
a little bit that was actually creative 

2882
02:24:58,921 --> 02:25:01,560
and providing value to the company.
Really.

2883
02:25:01,890 --> 02:25:02,723
Yeah.
So it was really inefficient in that 

2884
02:25:03,751 --> 02:25:04,584
regard.
Right.

2885
02:25:05,160 --> 02:25:08,670
And you know,
it's similar in a lot of companies do so

2886
02:25:08,820 --> 02:25:10,830
and that creates some of this,
you know,

2887
02:25:11,700 --> 02:25:13,190
nonlinear,
uh,

2888
02:25:13,500 --> 02:25:18,200
benefits of working just a little more 
per week and you know,

2889
02:25:18,290 --> 02:25:19,123
we see this a lot in silicon valley 
where there's a lot of people right out 

2890
02:25:22,081 --> 02:25:24,070
of college and they're willing to work

2891
02:25:24,640 --> 02:25:26,350
a ton of time especially,
you know,

2892
02:25:26,351 --> 02:25:29,660
you can essentially live at Google.
So there's not,

2893
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:30,461
I mean,
yeah,

2894
02:25:30,461 --> 02:25:32,560
there's free food everywhere.
There's showers,

2895
02:25:32,561 --> 02:25:34,450
there's a gem.
The beds,

2896
02:25:34,950 --> 02:25:37,390
there is nap pods.
Pods,

2897
02:25:37,410 --> 02:25:38,650
yeah.
Wow.

2898
02:25:38,710 --> 02:25:39,730
Are they closed off?
She can,

2899
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:42,010
can't hear anything out there.
But can you actually step in there?

2900
02:25:42,011 --> 02:25:42,844
Good.
I can't really sleep in there just 

2901
02:25:44,111 --> 02:25:46,570
because I'm too tall,
but most people,

2902
02:25:46,571 --> 02:25:49,450
yeah,
you can sleep in there because some they

2903
02:25:49,451 --> 02:25:51,790
like close it off and you could just lay
there.

2904
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:52,983
Um,
is there a term for a being being 

2905
02:25:55,751 --> 02:25:58,930
discriminary discriminatory towards tall
people?

2906
02:26:00,190 --> 02:26:01,300
Yeah.
Tallest.

2907
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:02,870
Hightest.
Yeah.

2908
02:26:02,871 --> 02:26:04,270
I just like,
there's able lists,

2909
02:26:04,420 --> 02:26:05,253
right?
There's a few mock people that aren't 

2910
02:26:06,641 --> 02:26:08,440
able to do things.
You become an herbalist.

2911
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:11,830
There's definitely a movement now of 
looking into.

2912
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:12,753
Oh,
maybe tell people have some advantages 

2913
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:15,153
because we see that a lot of ceos are 
over six feet tall and it's not clear 

2914
02:26:19,060 --> 02:26:20,260
why exactly that is.

2915
02:26:20,650 --> 02:26:21,483
I knew you really have to control for 
every aspect because there is no 

2916
02:26:25,150 --> 02:26:27,550
correlation between height and 
intelligence,

2917
02:26:27,970 --> 02:26:30,130
but it's likely not just that,
you know,

2918
02:26:30,360 --> 02:26:31,193
but what I'm saying is like they're 
discriminating against you with the 

2919
02:26:32,861 --> 02:26:34,850
pots.
Hook your fucking seven,

2920
02:26:35,130 --> 02:26:36,040
like six,
four,

2921
02:26:36,130 --> 02:26:36,963
six,
three hook you up with a six for pod 

2922
02:26:38,951 --> 02:26:39,784
man.
We can stretch your legs out and get a 

2923
02:26:41,291 --> 02:26:42,124
good nap.
Maybe it'd be more productive at a job 

2924
02:26:43,571 --> 02:26:44,404
you don't work out anymore.
I guess I just never really felt like 

2925
02:26:47,261 --> 02:26:49,240
complaining too much.
Good for you.

2926
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:50,740
Except for that one thing.

2927
02:26:53,590 --> 02:26:55,060
One thing.
So,

2928
02:26:55,061 --> 02:26:55,894
um,
are you trying to seek other employment 

2929
02:26:59,140 --> 02:27:00,970
or are you.
Yeah,

2930
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:02,660
I'm still looking at,
you know,

2931
02:27:02,680 --> 02:27:06,040
what exactly I want to do because I 
never was,

2932
02:27:06,690 --> 02:27:08,440
you know,
coding wasn't the thing that I was doing

2933
02:27:08,441 --> 02:27:10,600
my entire life.
Is that what your education is in?

2934
02:27:10,780 --> 02:27:13,840
No,
so I was doing physics and biology,

2935
02:27:14,050 --> 02:27:14,883
random mass stuff and I just picked up 
some algorithm books and they seemed 

2936
02:27:20,221 --> 02:27:21,054
really cool.
So I started doing some coding 

2937
02:27:22,481 --> 02:27:27,340
competitions and I did well enough that 
Google just like randomly contacted me.

2938
02:27:27,640 --> 02:27:28,750
Wow.
How weird.

2939
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:31,210
And especially since you're a white 
male,

2940
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:37,420
back in the day before they figured out 
discriminate here,

2941
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:40,810
this was all online then I had a 
username so maybe they didn't know.

2942
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:42,910
Oh,
that's interesting.

2943
02:27:43,090 --> 02:27:46,960
So they contacted you and offering you 
employment based on your coding skills?

2944
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:48,310
Yeah,
that's weird.

2945
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:49,953
Oh,
that's cool.

2946
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:50,973
So,
um,

2947
02:27:51,310 --> 02:27:53,650
so now you're just trying to figure out 
what the next.

2948
02:27:53,720 --> 02:27:55,060
How old are you?
Twenty eight.

2949
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:56,043
So he's telling you very young man,
you got to figure out what the path is 

2950
02:27:58,530 --> 02:27:59,363
going to be.
Huh?

2951
02:28:00,190 --> 02:28:02,140
Yeah.
You're leaning one way or another,

2952
02:28:03,130 --> 02:28:05,740
uh,
something that uses my brain,

2953
02:28:05,800 --> 02:28:07,030
but yeah,
that'd be nice.

2954
02:28:09,130 --> 02:28:13,750
Something outside of tech maybe or what 
navy or I still feel like,

2955
02:28:13,790 --> 02:28:14,623
you know,
tech in general is or the future and 

2956
02:28:16,660 --> 02:28:20,500
will have huge impact on the world.
So something related to tech,

2957
02:28:20,501 --> 02:28:25,501
but maybe not coding all day,
but I really don't know because,

2958
02:28:25,710 --> 02:28:26,543
you know,
most of the major silicon valley jobs 

2959
02:28:28,700 --> 02:28:31,040
probably a blacklisted me.
Really?

2960
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:32,570
Yeah.
Wow.

2961
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:35,370
That's unfortunate man.
Um,

2962
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:37,430
because like I said,
I've read your memo.

2963
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:41,330
I don't think you did anything wrong.
I think you did.

2964
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:42,193
You took a bold choice and a bold stance
to talk about something that's 

2965
02:28:47,271 --> 02:28:49,670
essentially taboo,
but you did it with science,

2966
02:28:50,120 --> 02:28:51,260
you know,
and you did it.

2967
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:54,170
It didn't,
you didn't a very reasonable manner.

2968
02:28:54,200 --> 02:28:54,921
You know,
and I'm,

2969
02:28:54,921 --> 02:28:58,730
I'm shocked at the reaction has been as 
extreme as it's been,

2970
02:28:59,450 --> 02:29:01,270
but I'm not shocked at the same time.
Right.

2971
02:29:01,320 --> 02:29:03,200
I mean,
it's predictable almost.

2972
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:06,050
And the people calling you a massage 
nest.

2973
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:11,150
It was very weird and CEO of youtube 
saying it hurt her to read that,

2974
02:29:11,350 --> 02:29:16,250
like,
you're going to have a real life yet.

2975
02:29:16,390 --> 02:29:17,450
I mean,
I thought that,

2976
02:29:17,780 --> 02:29:18,860
you know,
the first,

2977
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:19,753
the intro which talked about all these 
political biases and how our culture 

2978
02:29:23,331 --> 02:29:25,730
shames people that give a different 
view.

2979
02:29:25,731 --> 02:29:28,250
I thought that might have shown that,
you know,

2980
02:29:28,251 --> 02:29:31,300
maybe we shouldn't be doing that,
but you know,

2981
02:29:31,320 --> 02:29:34,820
predicted exactly what happened to me.
I think very few people actually read it

2982
02:29:35,480 --> 02:29:36,140
probably.
Yeah.

2983
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:38,390
Yeah.
Especially like globally,

2984
02:29:38,720 --> 02:29:40,520
very few people.
It's a very bad.

2985
02:29:40,580 --> 02:29:41,480
I think,
you know,

2986
02:29:41,570 --> 02:29:42,403
the responses to it,
a very click baity and people go with 

2987
02:29:44,721 --> 02:29:49,721
whatever the titles of the articles that
are criticizing you and just accept that

2988
02:29:49,941 --> 02:29:51,120
as Gospel,
you know?

2989
02:29:51,260 --> 02:29:53,960
Yeah.
I've gotten a lot of responses that were

2990
02:29:53,961 --> 02:29:54,920
just,
Oh yeah,

2991
02:29:54,921 --> 02:29:56,210
I saw it on facebook,
you know,

2992
02:29:56,211 --> 02:29:57,470
some sexist memo.

2993
02:29:58,250 --> 02:30:02,720
And it was only after they saw that so 
many times and they decided to read it,

2994
02:30:02,750 --> 02:30:05,330
but they finally were like,
oh no,

2995
02:30:05,331 --> 02:30:06,860
it's not that bad.
Yeah.

2996
02:30:07,010 --> 02:30:08,990
I urge people,
if you have the time,

2997
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:10,693
just please just read it.
Just go over it and try to figure out 

2998
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:18,560
where it all went wrong.
I'm glad you did it though,

2999
02:30:18,561 --> 02:30:19,071
man.
I mean,

3000
02:30:19,071 --> 02:30:23,000
it's a really interesting point of 
discussion and I hope this lawsuit works

3001
02:30:23,001 --> 02:30:23,834
out well for you.
And I helped Google just come to their 

3002
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:27,590
senses and I don't think that's going to
happen,

3003
02:30:27,950 --> 02:30:30,110
you know?
What do you predict?

3004
02:30:30,111 --> 02:30:30,980
What do you think's going to happen?

3005
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:33,993
I don't know.
I think that people now are aware of 

3006
02:30:37,611 --> 02:30:38,444
this a lot more and there may be 
platforms that emerge that are sort of 

3007
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:44,293
all tech is what they're calling it.
Just alternative technology that's more 

3008
02:30:48,021 --> 02:30:52,930
open to just free speech.
But unfortunately they're currently just

3009
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:56,560
being labeled as white supremacist sites
and you know,

3010
02:30:56,790 --> 02:30:58,670
it's,
I,

3011
02:30:58,790 --> 02:30:59,623
hopefully people can see through that.
I don't know if they have the time to 

3012
02:31:03,741 --> 02:31:05,540
even look.
That's the thing.

3013
02:31:05,541 --> 02:31:06,374
It's just like they're,
they're taking everyone's word for 

3014
02:31:08,511 --> 02:31:11,630
everything.
It's very odd time,

3015
02:31:11,780 --> 02:31:14,960
but there's enough people discussing it,
you know,

3016
02:31:14,961 --> 02:31:16,700
and I think your,
um,

3017
02:31:17,030 --> 02:31:17,863
the response to your memo has been,
it's been very enlightening for some 

3018
02:31:22,171 --> 02:31:23,004
people from,
from a sort of a psychological 

3019
02:31:25,741 --> 02:31:26,960
standpoint.
Like what,

3020
02:31:26,961 --> 02:31:30,630
what are the reactions that people have 
and why do they have these reactions and

3021
02:31:30,631 --> 02:31:31,464
what is it,
what does it say about us as human 

3022
02:31:32,641 --> 02:31:37,641
beings at this is such a taboo subject 
that we can't even address the very real

3023
02:31:38,221 --> 02:31:41,040
differences that we have as unique 
individuals.

3024
02:31:41,130 --> 02:31:45,600
You know,
I'm at least happy that it didn't happen

3025
02:31:45,601 --> 02:31:46,434
during a college season is then there'd 
be like protests and people burning my 

3026
02:31:51,091 --> 02:31:51,924
fig years and things.
So I think it would have been a much 

3027
02:31:54,331 --> 02:31:57,240
more negative if it was during the 
school year.

3028
02:31:57,330 --> 02:32:00,960
Wow.
And they would demand that their school,

3029
02:32:01,410 --> 02:32:05,480
you know,
double down on diversity and just all of

3030
02:32:05,490 --> 02:32:06,900
these things.
But yeah,

3031
02:32:06,901 --> 02:32:07,734
a lot of virtue signaling going on.
It's at least it's nice to see some of 

3032
02:32:14,131 --> 02:32:19,131
the colleges have been standing up for 
it or against it and you know,

3033
02:32:19,410 --> 02:32:20,243
saying,
no,

3034
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:22,260
you can't really just tell us what to 
do.

3035
02:32:22,261 --> 02:32:25,280
And we believe in,
you know,

3036
02:32:25,500 --> 02:32:30,500
knowledge and actually seeking the truth
and not just criticizing people based on

3037
02:32:30,841 --> 02:32:33,900
their political ideologies.
Yeah,

3038
02:32:34,540 --> 02:32:36,300
it's a long slog.
My friend.

3039
02:32:36,610 --> 02:32:37,443
It was a lot,
a lot of walking and talking and going 

3040
02:32:38,671 --> 02:32:39,720
on,
but uh,

3041
02:32:40,320 --> 02:32:41,153
I think it will be fun.

3042
02:32:41,250 --> 02:32:42,083
I hope I hope will be fine if we don't 
go to war with North Korea and get 

3043
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,160
smashed by 100 fucking hurricanes in a 
row.

3044
02:32:47,860 --> 02:32:48,693
Um,
but I think we should just got to tweak 

3045
02:32:54,421 --> 02:32:55,770
that.
You're a bad ass in chess.

3046
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:58,560
Chess master.
Yeah.

3047
02:32:58,561 --> 02:33:00,330
I played a lot of just,
yeah,

3048
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:03,990
that,
that was my life for a few years.

3049
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:06,450
Can you play chess in your head?
Yeah.

3050
02:33:06,800 --> 02:33:07,920
Wow.
That's fascinating.

3051
02:33:07,921 --> 02:33:11,670
I used to play chess in my head against 
like for different people.

3052
02:33:11,820 --> 02:33:14,970
So like blindfolded.
Whoa,

3053
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,863
dude.
I knew this kid who was a chess master 

3054
02:33:18,510 --> 02:33:22,830
and a pool hall that he used to go to 
and he used to play with this ex con and

3055
02:33:22,831 --> 02:33:25,290
the ex con learned how to do chest and 
prison,

3056
02:33:25,570 --> 02:33:26,403
uh,
in his head with no pieces and him and 

3057
02:33:28,260 --> 02:33:31,800
this kid would just sit there and play 
chess back and forth with each other.

3058
02:33:31,820 --> 02:33:36,030
Now what are you guys doing?
How do you know where the board is?

3059
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:39,750
You could play it blindfolded with four 
people in your head.

3060
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:40,830
Yeah.
Wow.

3061
02:33:40,831 --> 02:33:43,560
That's intense man.
How'd you learn how to do that?

3062
02:33:43,710 --> 02:33:46,160
Just repetition over time.
Yeah,

3063
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:48,810
doing it a lot and just obsessing over 
it.

3064
02:33:49,050 --> 02:33:49,883
And this is actually one of the 
differences on average between men and 

3065
02:33:53,581 --> 02:33:54,414
women is there are more men that are 
just become obsessed with these systems 

3066
02:33:58,260 --> 02:33:59,010
and so,
you know,

3067
02:33:59,010 --> 02:34:00,000
magic.
The gathering,

3068
02:34:00,001 --> 02:34:03,300
the card game was also something that I 
became super obsessed with.

3069
02:34:03,870 --> 02:34:04,703
And so the way that people approach 
computers too is different where you 

3070
02:34:08,300 --> 02:34:11,250
know,
some are a lot of boys just approach the

3071
02:34:11,251 --> 02:34:12,084
computer as a toy and they become 
obsessed with tinkering with the 

3072
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:18,250
computer while a lot girls see it as

3073
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:19,383
a tool for improving the world and so 
they may not be interested in the 

3074
02:34:23,921 --> 02:34:24,754
computer as an end to itself.
And so a lot of the education programs 

3075
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:33,400
to get more women into tech are actually
addressing that.

3076
02:34:34,180 --> 02:34:39,180
But it's unclear because so much of a 
coding is just,

3077
02:34:39,910 --> 02:34:40,743
you know,
writing server code and this server is 

3078
02:34:43,361 --> 02:34:44,194
going to go talk to this server which is
talking to that server and it's totally 

3079
02:34:47,081 --> 02:34:50,920
unconnected to actual people and,
but you know,

3080
02:34:50,921 --> 02:34:55,921
that's why we actually see more women in
front end and use your experience,

3081
02:34:55,990 --> 02:34:56,823
um,
engineering positions because it's more 

3082
02:34:59,740 --> 02:35:00,573
interactive with people.
What are the numbers with women in 

3083
02:35:02,291 --> 02:35:03,910
chess?
Yeah,

3084
02:35:03,911 --> 02:35:06,130
there aren't that many.
And it's unfortunate.

3085
02:35:07,870 --> 02:35:10,570
I,
is it unfortunate because it's just,

3086
02:35:10,780 --> 02:35:11,850
it is.
Yeah.

3087
02:35:11,851 --> 02:35:12,684
Yeah.
I don't play chess is that 

3088
02:35:13,271 --> 02:35:14,104
unfortunately.
So why is it unfortunate that women are 

3089
02:35:17,621 --> 02:35:18,640
underrepresented?

3090
02:35:19,160 --> 02:35:19,993
Well,
just for the cases of maybe they feel 

3091
02:35:22,551 --> 02:35:23,384
like a minority and you a right and a 
lot of the mistreatment of women is not 

3092
02:35:31,790 --> 02:35:34,730
ill intentioned men that want to be 
sexist against men.

3093
02:35:34,731 --> 02:35:37,340
It's just,
I and I felt this a lot and you know,

3094
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:42,110
everyone wants a girl to play chess or 
play magic.

3095
02:35:42,111 --> 02:35:42,944
The gathering,
you know that that's their ideal 

3096
02:35:45,051 --> 02:35:48,020
girlfriend.
So,

3097
02:35:48,830 --> 02:35:51,470
and,
but they're all nerdy guys are generally

3098
02:35:51,471 --> 02:35:54,860
and they don't have as good social 
skills as the average population.

3099
02:35:54,861 --> 02:35:55,694
And you know,
they're pretty similar to the people 

3100
02:35:56,871 --> 02:36:01,871
playing or a writing code,
so it's a similar situation so they just

3101
02:36:02,421 --> 02:36:06,500
don't know how to interact with women 
and that causes some problems.

3102
02:36:08,040 --> 02:36:08,873
But,
so it's not the just overt sexism 

3103
02:36:13,491 --> 02:36:14,324
against women,
it's more just we don't really know how 

3104
02:36:17,151 --> 02:36:19,370
to interact with women,
we just,

3105
02:36:20,110 --> 02:36:22,340
you know,
we're obsessed with jazz or whatever and

3106
02:36:22,820 --> 02:36:23,653
we just like talking about chess and 
there are a lot of women that just 

3107
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:30,920
aren't as obsessed with these sort of 
systems.

3108
02:36:32,300 --> 02:36:36,080
So.
But I mean that's not a bad thing,

3109
02:36:36,240 --> 02:36:37,740
right?
It just is what it is.

3110
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:39,180
Yeah.
I mean,

3111
02:36:39,270 --> 02:36:43,470
I'm sure there's a bunch of fashion 
things and aesthetics thing,

3112
02:36:43,480 --> 02:36:44,313
et Cetera,
aesthetic things and design things that 

3113
02:36:46,411 --> 02:36:49,380
women are really into that a lot of men 
don't give a fuck about.

3114
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:50,363
Yeah.
It's not a terrible thing that men 

3115
02:36:51,781 --> 02:36:55,620
aren't into design does not more men 
involved in interior design.

3116
02:36:55,621 --> 02:36:56,970
It's not a terrible thing.

3117
02:36:57,300 --> 02:36:59,670
And that's sort of one of the 
unfortunate thing is too,

3118
02:36:59,671 --> 02:37:03,660
is that there's so much fighting to get 
more women into tech,

3119
02:37:03,661 --> 02:37:07,950
but there's no fighting to get more men 
into nursing.

3120
02:37:08,030 --> 02:37:11,070
Right.
Any of these more female dominated.

3121
02:37:11,930 --> 02:37:16,160
Do you think that's also because of the 
financial rewards of tech are so extreme

3122
02:37:16,161 --> 02:37:19,190
in comparison,
like nursing is pretty kept salary.

3123
02:37:19,490 --> 02:37:23,390
Whereas if you can climb the corporate 
ladder as a,

3124
02:37:23,420 --> 02:37:25,370
you know,
a ceo of some sort of a tech company,

3125
02:37:25,371 --> 02:37:27,170
the rewards are substantial.

3126
02:37:27,790 --> 02:37:28,623
Yeah.
I think inevitably there will be more 

3127
02:37:31,330 --> 02:37:32,163
men attracted to high paying jobs simply
because they fight for status and money 

3128
02:37:36,821 --> 02:37:37,654
is how you gain status often.
So that's partly why they see tech as a 

3129
02:37:42,430 --> 02:37:43,263
target,
but it's not as if nursing is a bad job 

3130
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:49,030
that gets paid well.
And there are many people that,

3131
02:37:49,420 --> 02:37:52,750
you know,
go to college for premed and dropout,

3132
02:37:52,960 --> 02:37:55,780
like 90 percent of people that started 
as premed dropout.

3133
02:37:56,290 --> 02:38:01,060
And the men feel like they can't enter 
nursing because that's too feminine.

3134
02:38:01,570 --> 02:38:04,720
And there's huge biases against men 
becoming feminine.

3135
02:38:04,900 --> 02:38:05,740
Like,
you know,

3136
02:38:05,870 --> 02:38:10,360
man can't wear dresses,
but girls can be openly tomboyish.

3137
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:12,230
Right?
Right.

3138
02:38:12,720 --> 02:38:13,553
So there's unfortunately some 
asymmetries in our culture and there's 

3139
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:20,520
reasons for it.
You know,

3140
02:38:20,521 --> 02:38:21,354
if a guy is too feminine,
then he can't necessarily fulfill his 

3141
02:38:25,410 --> 02:38:28,290
gender role,
which is being a provider and protector.

3142
02:38:29,150 --> 02:38:29,941
Uh,
so,

3143
02:38:29,941 --> 02:38:30,774
you know,
you have to be aggressive to be a good 

3144
02:38:32,700 --> 02:38:36,420
protector and provider for your wife.
But,

3145
02:38:36,480 --> 02:38:39,450
uh,
the females gender role being a nurturer

3146
02:38:40,110 --> 02:38:41,040
is,
you know,

3147
02:38:41,041 --> 02:38:41,874
it's fine to be feminine and so a lot of
the gender disparities that we see and 

3148
02:38:50,670 --> 02:38:55,440
gender norms are just a but behind those
two gender roles.

3149
02:38:56,740 --> 02:38:57,600
Yeah.
I think,

3150
02:38:57,601 --> 02:38:58,434
uh,
there's a lot of evidence to support 

3151
02:38:59,261 --> 02:39:00,520
that and I think,
um,

3152
02:39:00,580 --> 02:39:01,413
that was essentially a big part of what 
you were talking about in your memo and 

3153
02:39:04,530 --> 02:39:05,363
I don't think you're a bad guy dude,
and I think you've been unfairly 

3154
02:39:07,360 --> 02:39:11,050
maligned and uh,
I'm glad we had a chance to sit down and

3155
02:39:11,051 --> 02:39:12,680
talk and uh,
and uh,

3156
02:39:12,681 --> 02:39:13,514
I wish you well man.
I hope it all works out and keep us 

3157
02:39:15,401 --> 02:39:17,140
posted and we'll let everybody else know
too.

3158
02:39:17,141 --> 02:39:17,901
Okay.
Okay.

3159
02:39:17,901 --> 02:39:18,620
Yeah.
Thank you James.

3160
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:19,230
Appreciate it,
man.

3161
02:39:19,230 --> 02:39:20,440
Very nice to meet you.
Thank you.

3162
02:39:20,850 --> 02:39:22,600
All right folks.
Say for today.

3163
02:39:23,330 --> 02:39:24,163
Bye.
Bye.

3164
02:39:28,980 --> 02:39:31,860
How long was that?
Almost three hours.
