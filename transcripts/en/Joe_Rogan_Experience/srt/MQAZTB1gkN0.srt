1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:06,103
Okay.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,443
Experience

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,060
Rain Soak jungle of the Pacific northwest.

4
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:22,530
We're hippies flourish. Chris
Ryan, dude, they're out there, man.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,980
It's like they're like monkeys in the
jungle. They're like bugs in the forest.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,930
Yeah. Flowers in the
garden. Yeah. That too.

7
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,160
You could look at it in a positive
way. Yeah. It's a good place for them.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
It's an interesting place.
You're going to be there this weekend.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,270
I'm very excited. I love Portland. I fuck
with them about being hippie infested,

10
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:46,710
but better that than fucking psychos.
You know? That's true. That's true.

11
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,210
It's an interesting place that it's got
such a strong culture for such a small

12
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,860
city. Yeah. You know what I mean?

13
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:55,710
There are huge cities three times that
size where like you don't even know

14
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:00,270
you're there. Right. Based on how people
dress, food, you know, attitude, whatever.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,200
Portland is so specific and sort
of micro cultural. Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,070
I was talking to a friend who grew up
there the other day and I asked him what's

17
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:12,380
the biggest change from 20 years ago?
And it was interesting and he said, uh,

18
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,740
not eccentricity. It was really eccentric.
Then it's the same now. You know,

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,350
that sort of became the
calling card of Portland.

20
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:23,040
He said the big difference is there
was no smugness 20 years ago. Oh,

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,750
now people are smug now.
Yeah.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,080
Because I think people who sort of
choose that identity then go to Portland.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,420
You know what I mean? Like hippies
who are actually kind of Nazis. Yeah.

24
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,630
There's a lot of those, right? Yeah.
Like really judgmental hippies,

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,890
like super ultra left wing people who
are really just mean and they just find a

26
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:45,330
target and the target is a right wing.

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,470
So they go after them with or whomever
or they often go after each other.

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,813
It's like,

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,650
and so there's like a a fascist mentality
that just happens to have chosen a

30
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:59,100
hippie outfit off the rack.
Exactly.

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,910
I had an ex girlfriend who was really
into fashion and I remember one time her

32
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,870
saying, we lived in San Francisco for a
while and I remember her saying, yeah,

33
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:10,830
I want to, I want to go for a hippy look.
You know what I'm going to like buy the,

34
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,664
the fringe.

35
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,700
I just remember thinking like that is
so antithetical to what a hippie is.

36
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:21,000
You know,
like to go buy expensive hippie outfit.

37
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,510
Isn't that perfect though
that it's America. It's like,

38
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:29,160
it's like spraying body odor deodorant.
So you'll smell like a dirty hippy,

39
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,990
you know, I saw this commercial, not a
commercial, like a website rather online.

40
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,400
That cells use genes,
right?

41
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,150
They sell jeans that people
wore and they have like,

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,680
I mean they have like stains on them.

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Some of them have patches and they
were $270 for a used pair of jeans.

44
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,150
Good gig though. Be a Jean wearer.
Good Gig to be selling these genes.

45
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:54,030
You could probably buy from
goodwill for really cheap,

46
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,990
and I forget the name of the
company, but they're, their hook is,

47
00:02:57,991 --> 00:03:01,970
they're trying to make you look like,
you know, you're worn these man, right?

48
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,170
I don't care about what I
looked like, man, you're,

49
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:07,170
you're buying $270 use clothes.

50
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,140
Like you're instead of wearing
them and turning them into that,

51
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,410
you were immediately trying
to like adopt that persona.

52
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,500
I'm a comfortable pair of
jeans flicking me with my,

53
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,190
like when you see like fake rips,
those fake rips and people love it.

54
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,630
They're crazy.
Like what are you doing?

55
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:27,510
You're buying torn clothes and you think
it gives you a look down home. I'm,

56
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,740
the knees are just all worn out and these
pants, man, I'm waiting for, you know,

57
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:36,310
it works with clothes. I'm waiting for
it to work with the body, you know,

58
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,900
because I just turned 53 recently and
I'm like when it is old and fat going to

59
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,381
be in,

60
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:45,580
because it's a time when
genetic engineering kicks
in and everybody looks like

61
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:49,240
Doctor Manhattan.
Then like old ugly fat will be wow.

62
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,520
Interesting new. Yeah. It's
something different bag. It's like,

63
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,420
like a lot of white guys who are into
Asian women will go to Asian countries

64
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:02,580
like China for instance, cause there's
no white men. They're not as many rather.

65
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,770
Yeah. And so they become an oddity.
It's like how I've experienced that.

66
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:08,560
I remember the,
I can remember the first night,

67
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,690
I can remember the minute I
experienced that thinking like what,

68
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,370
you know first everyone's looking at me,
okay I'm a foreigner. Whatever's were,

69
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:21,580
but these women are smiling and Flirtin
and what that, what's going on? And,

70
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,580
and you know, eventually someone
explained to me like, dude, you're white.

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,270
They love,
and I've always had,

72
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,950
the one thing about my body that
I would complain about is my skin.

73
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,210
I've never liked my skin.

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,500
Like all I've got as much
melanin is anyone else,

75
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:40,180
but it's all in my teeth.
So I've got yellow teeth and
super pale skin, you know.

76
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,490
Um, do you get burnt real
easy? Completely. You know,
what is your bank minutes?

77
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,530
Irish? Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember
red head, which is like, you know,

78
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:54,300
one tweak away from albino red head.

79
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,930
I used to be gone gray and now do
you prefer the gray or the red? Well,

80
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,710
the Guy Kinda could thing going on and
go a blondish right. For an accident.

81
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,430
That's it. When you mix red with gray, you
get blonde. Right. But no, when I was a,

82
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:11,020
you know, until I was in my thirties
or forties probably, um, you know,

83
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:15,190
I had sort of orange, red hair.
Whoa. Yeah, it was dark orange.

84
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:19,780
It was like copper wire kind of
color. Um, so it wasn't Bozo.

85
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,100
That's very close.
People are prejudice against that in men.

86
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,680
Yeah. Sexy man. It's deep.
Geeky. How does that happen?

87
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,030
Well, maybe because of the
novelty and also there's a,

88
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:37,810
there's a reputation among redheads
for being sort of temperamental and

89
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:40,820
everybody knows a temperamental
woman's a lot of fun in bed. Right.

90
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,071
Maybe that's it.

91
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:46,830
And temperamental men are just
dangerous drunks except assholes.

92
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,400
Fires you hassles. That's funny.
Raquel Welch was a red head,

93
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:53,920
although she was Mexican,
so I'm not sure how that happened.

94
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,250
Everything I've seen from Raquel
Welsh, it was so old. I can't remember.

95
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,460
Or it was black and white. Yeah,
she was a redhead. Like a dark red.

96
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,450
I think she dyed it. Yeah, but just
like Auburn, reddish kind of bloody.

97
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,250
You think di was like back then,

98
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,430
what would they just grind up some leaves
and fucking rub them in their hair?

99
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,960
Well, they apparently had, um, what's
that stuff they use in Pakistan? Uh,

100
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,240
uh, Hannah. Oh, you know Hannah's goes
way back. Yeah, that's, that's tough.

101
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:24,140
Is Strong Shit too, right?
People get those fake Henna
Tattoos. They last for days,

102
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,670
came to scrub them off. The dudes
in Pakistan, Henna dye their beards.

103
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,320
That's look, oh, that's funny. So
like when, when they start going gray,

104
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:39,230
that's their version of just for
men. Exactly. That's funny man.

105
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,630
Yeah. Yeah. No one wants to be gray.

106
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,060
That's the one thing like
universally people like, Ooh,

107
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,710
that's a fucking tricky one man.

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,170
Did they think so I'm not
happy about my gray hairs.

109
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,980
I just grew in a little chin beard
here and it's completely white.

110
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,590
And I had one five,

111
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,320
six years ago when I was
traveling and it was still red.

112
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,650
So we don't know what happened between
then and now. I got old man. Oh,

113
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:03,280
so you weren't shaving, you were
shaving it completely. Yeah.

114
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,440
So it was like a snapshot. I,
there was no gradual process.

115
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,060
I still have mostly like say
be like 80% black in my beard,

116
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,510
but like the sides of my hair, like where
if I have any, this is all going white.

117
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:16,460
Now all this is gray on the sides.

118
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,130
So you think the grades more
traumatic than the balding?

119
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,550
Cause I've gone through both.
Both of them are rough. Um,

120
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,030
the gray is probably less traumatic cause
I know dudes who are totally gray who

121
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:28,910
dye their hair and they look fine
or they look fine with the gray.

122
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,750
Which gentleman kind of thing?
I know both. Yeah. It just,

123
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:36,920
while it just represents
reality represents the
finite nature of the body and

124
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:40,610
usually going through a process and also
like I was talking about how I'm hoping

125
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:43,850
that like old and fat comes in
now that I'm almost there or,

126
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,720
or they're dependent
arguably, uh, you, your,

127
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:51,260
your sort of balding experience happened
at a really good time. Historically,

128
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,170
I've got lucky sorta,
but I fought it for the longest time.

129
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:57,850
I had hair transplants,
Propecia and I put Rogaine in there,

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,770
which is very ironic.
And your name is Rogan.

131
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,110
You're going bald and you're
buying rover shake sponsorship.

132
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,720
Especially when you had to go to the
counter. Like now you can just buy it,

133
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,790
but you just have to go up
to the fucking pharmacist.

134
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,070
He said prescription for that Shit.
Yeah.

135
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:14,630
I've bought a lot of Rogaine in my day
because my ex father in law in Spain had

136
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,100
me bring it back from the states.

137
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:18,410
Every time I came to visit he
couldn't get it over there.

138
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,040
I think it was like he thought it
was stronger or better in some way.

139
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:26,990
So it was like the only thing that kept
my relationship with him, partly civil.

140
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,270
I so wished that I shaved my head way,
way,

141
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:32,690
way back in the day when I first
started worrying about it and way better

142
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,040
because I love being bald. Like I really,
I don't, if I could grow here back now,

143
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,470
I would still shave it.
It's the easiest thing in the world.

144
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:43,430
I don't have to go to. I had
a great barber and she was
hilarious. A hairstylist,

145
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,150
my friend Gabrielle. Oh she, she worked
on news radio with me. She was my,

146
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,710
she cut my hair forever,
you know?

147
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,720
But at a certain point in
time she was cutting it.

148
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:54,680
It just looked like dog shit after she
was just like get thinner and thinner.

149
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,370
And then once I quit taking the Propecia,

150
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,480
then it was like a serious
downhill slide. Oh really? Yeah.

151
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,070
Shit was just dying left and right.
It was horrible. I agree with you.

152
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,720
I think that all young men like in their
mid twenties should shave their heads.

153
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah. It's just so you don't worry about
it. If you're going bald, for sure.

154
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,110
Shave your head. I say people don't
want to shake my head. Believe me.

155
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,200
Take control.
Yeah.

156
00:09:17,201 --> 00:09:20,040
It's better than whatever the fuck is
gonna happen if you don't shave your head.

157
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,100
I wanted to shave my head. I
wouldn't, we were in India,

158
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:26,910
I was with my wife Caselden
in India, in Goa. For months.

159
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,600
We were in Asia for like over a year
and I thought this is a perfect time to

160
00:09:30,601 --> 00:09:33,900
shave my head because if I've got a weird
shaped head or I look like a Dork or

161
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:38,460
whatever, who gives a fuck? Right. Nobody
knows me. Um, and I came to her one day,

162
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,410
we rented this House on
the beach. I was like, hey,

163
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:44,160
cut my hair and I want to shave my head.
And she said, oh, please don't do that,

164
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,620
please. So why? Why? Well,

165
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,010
it's not just because she's used to
me looking like a Dork, but it was,

166
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,420
my father had just had a liver transplant
and she said in India you shaved your

167
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,230
head when your father dies and like,

168
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:01,170
and she's very suspicious and she's
got all these beliefs and she's like,

169
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,020
you know, to understand your
father's and rocky shape,

170
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,960
you don't want to be shaving your
head. You know, that's different. Yeah,

171
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,770
I could see that. Oh, I miss
my, I miss my chance. Yeah.

172
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,430
I missed my chance when
I was on news radio.

173
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:14,100
That's when I got my hair transplant.
My first one, I got three of them.

174
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,070
When I got my first one, I was on
news radio and I was like, God damn,

175
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:21,300
this shit is going man. I just like,
it was seeing it fallen out and uh,

176
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,820
I was like, I'm thinking about shaving
my head. They were like, don't do it.

177
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,100
Don't do it. I'm like, my hair
is starting to look like shit.

178
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,230
And they talked me out of it.

179
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:31,930
Well because it will fuck because of
your character. Right? You like, it goes,

180
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,900
you'd look like a psycho. I'm like,
all right. So I didn't, you know,

181
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,200
people get used to whatever the
fuck you look. Right. Exactly.

182
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,070
Like I have a picture of Joey Diaz,
um, back when he was like 210 pounds.

183
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,970
It's crazy. It's on my wall in my
office. I stole it from the comedy store,

184
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,670
was a head shot that he had up. And
um, he, I don't even think it was up.

185
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,650
I think I stole it from the office.
I don't think they had put it up.

186
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,050
So I snacked it. Um, but it's, um,

187
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,760
it's Joey like Finn and like,
but if I saw it,

188
00:10:58,761 --> 00:11:01,950
if he'd walked in today looking like that,
I'd be like, what the fuck is going on?

189
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,070
You sick? Yeah. But I see him the
way he is now. I give him a big hug.

190
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:09,600
And that's Joey, you got used to, you
get used to the change. Definitely.

191
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,560
And I mean, just thinking about
the, I turned 53 last week, right?

192
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,360
So thinking about time and all that,

193
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,560
and I'm here in la visiting my
parents who are in their seventies.

194
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,610
So there's all that, you know, there are
a lot of cues for these things. And, um,

195
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,000
there's this famous poem by
Dylan Thomas where he says,

196
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:32,040
rage against the dying of the light. You
know, and I often think like, I dunno,

197
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,050
I don't know, maybe embrace the
darkness, you know, like the light,

198
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,760
like people fight, he lost the fight
against pancreatic cancer. Well, you know,

199
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:46,710
maybe that's not a fight worth
waging, you know? Well, no,

200
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,730
I know a guy who's got pancreatic cancer
whose fighting it and they gave him a

201
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:54,010
very short window to live and
he's pushed way that, and you

202
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,600
know,
and everybody's completely shocked,

203
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,470
but he has this amazing attitude
and he's positive and enjoying life.

204
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,510
And I think his point of view is not,

205
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,970
instead of rage against
the dying of the light,

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,870
enjoy the moment and live your life.
And I think because of that,

207
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:11,590
and he's actually living longer, there
was a guy, his name was bill boiler, uh,

208
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,590
who I became friends with
from the Internet. From my,
my own message board. And um,

209
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:21,390
he was a young kid who got pancreatic
cancer and he lived for years and,

210
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:26,660
uh, we became friends from online,
you know, he, he would have a,

211
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,300
he had a screen name,
we would call it a,

212
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,560
I think it's queen name was called Pan
can fight or a pan can like pancreatic

213
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:35,170
cancer for, I believe that
was a screen name. And um,

214
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,830
I would get them tickets to the UFC
and get them tickets to a comedy show.

215
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,750
And one time it came to visit me in
Florida and um, he came to the show,

216
00:12:43,751 --> 00:12:45,500
I got them tickets to this show and then,
you know,

217
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,830
he told him he was going to go
sleep in his car and I was like,

218
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:49,630
you drove all the way down here, you're
gonna Sleep in your car? He goes, yeah,

219
00:12:49,631 --> 00:12:52,290
I just wanted to see the show.
So I got him a hotel room and you know,

220
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,300
like this guy's got cancer
and sleep in his fucking car.

221
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,680
Like your immune system is like super
important when you have cancers.

222
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,940
Sleep is super important
for the immune system.

223
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,600
But he was always so
thankful and never weird.

224
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,310
And like for a kid,

225
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:11,311
a young kid who was facing this horrible
disease that almost nobody escapes

226
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:14,830
from, it's like the percentage of people
that survived one of the worst, very,

227
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:16,990
very bad.
But his attitude was always like,

228
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:18,490
I'm going to fucking fight
this and I'm gonna end it.

229
00:13:18,491 --> 00:13:22,720
Would post these tweets on the messages
on the message board. Like, uh,

230
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,510
three years later I'm still alive,
motherfucker. Like that kind of shit.

231
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,860
And you know, he had tubes in his
stomach when I saw him. Once we saw him,

232
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,060
Eddie Bravo and I became
friends with this kid.

233
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,970
We saw maybe six or seven times
over the years. And uh, you know,

234
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:40,990
one time we saw him, his head, he's lost
all his hair, his eyebrows were gone.

235
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,060
He had tubes coming out of
his stomach because you know,

236
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:46,930
some surgery that he had and he was still
alive and he still had a good attitude.

237
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,420
It was amazing what an attitude he had.

238
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,170
And I think that that attitude is probably
what allowed him to live for so long.

239
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,510
But he eventually did die recently
and as we all do, right. Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:03,160
It's funny, I saw the, the guy from 60
minutes who was in a car crash last week.

241
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,750
Did you see that? Um, I
forget his name, but he's 73,

242
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:10,510
he was 73 years old and the headline said,

243
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,000
this gentleman, his name, I can't
remember, lost his life in a car crash.

244
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,290
And I thought, you know, when you're
73, you're not losing your life.

245
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:23,980
You've already banked 73 years.
You're losing a couple of years.

246
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:27,850
You're losing whatever was left
at 11. Yeah. Me. Yeah. Yeah.

247
00:14:27,851 --> 00:14:32,830
Actuarial tables or something. Yeah.
Right. Um, that's not losing your life.

248
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,390
You've spent that money that's like,
you know,

249
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,120
somebody robs you and they got everything.
Well,

250
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:40,440
they didn't get everything and they didn't
get what I already spent. Right, right.

251
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,110
It's not like they spent, they
robbed your whole life savings. Well,

252
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,280
it really saved my whole life.

253
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,740
I've never saved a couple of weeks.
Yeah.

254
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,420
Really look at this picture
of Vince Mcmahon from the WWE.

255
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,400
69 years old. Seriously?
Yeah. This is insane.

256
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:01,380
And that's not shop that I'm going to, uh,
I'll, I'll, should I forward this to you,

257
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:04,970
Jamie? What's that? Okay.

258
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,970
He's on the cover of muscle and fitness.
Tony Hinchcliffe sent this to me.

259
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,010
Tony Hinchcliffe is a fucking WWE fanatic
and he's in love with Vince Mcmahon,

260
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,010
but nobody in human history has ever
looked like that at 69 years old. Yeah.

261
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,400
Testosterone is a motherfucker.
Yeah.

262
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,110
So if you want to rage against the dying
of the light, that's the way to go.

263
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,410
Get all pumped up testosterone
replacement therapy. Go to a doctor.

264
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,320
They bring it to the same level. So we
look at that picture. That's ridiculous.

265
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:33,950
It's up. Oh, sorry. It's behind you. Yeah,
he goes, now that other one, that's okay.

266
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,770
It doesn't have to be on, but
it's just ridiculous. Like,

267
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:41,360
who the fuck is ever looked like that
at 69 is it good or is it bad? You know,

268
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,460
I don't think it would be too terrible.

269
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:46,670
People could live to be a thousand years
if I knew that we had the resources to

270
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:50,750
support it because I would think like,
man, what kind of amazing philosophy,

271
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,210
insight would you get from a thousand
year old woman who's lived hundreds and

272
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,620
hundreds and hundreds
of years and you know,

273
00:15:57,621 --> 00:16:02,270
and seeing culture shift and change and
remembers as much as she could and tells

274
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:05,990
you about life in a way that only a
person has lived a thousand years and we

275
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:10,220
were are a little blips. You talked
to a guy that lived a hundred years,

276
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:12,050
you're going to be fascinated
if he has his faculties.

277
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,290
But someone who's lived a
thousand, my God, I mean it would,

278
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,790
holidays would be a bitch. So you imagine
the great, great, great, great grandkids.

279
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,950
She has to buy shit for.

280
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,150
Imagine the candles on his fucking
pain do with Dai blown them out.

281
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,240
Isn't it ironic, don't you think? Um,

282
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:34,030
I think that we're going to see a great
advance in our lifetime of, of lifespans.

283
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,620
But the real issue is do we
have the resources for that?

284
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:41,420
Because one of the things that is going
on with our world as everybody knows,

285
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,470
is that there's a lot more people today
than there's ever been in recorded human

286
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,270
history by a giant number.

287
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,200
And when you see places like
India that are in dire poverty,

288
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,210
it's one third of the
size of the United States.

289
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:56,930
It has three times as many
people. Plus it's like, wow,

290
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,770
I mean how that,

291
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,970
you're dealing with a lot of poverty
and a lot of suffering and you know,

292
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:05,660
maybe it's a perspective issue and
maybe what I considered poverty,

293
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,850
they consider life and
that if I lived that life,

294
00:17:07,851 --> 00:17:10,490
I would be accustomed to it
and it would be normalized.

295
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,640
But I've got to think that most
people don't want to sleep on dirt.

296
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,520
And most people don't want to
eat food that's bad. Or you know,

297
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,430
the struggle to survive in any way and
do your only with rampid diseases and

298
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,630
that you're dealing with an
impoverished nations, you know,

299
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:27,070
when they don't have enough medicine to
take care of people. I don't know, it's,

300
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,780
but if we did have the resources men,

301
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:34,130
it would be amazing to talk to a thousand
year old person who knew everything

302
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,530
about the the mean.
If you could keep your faculties,

303
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,360
how grumpy when they get these fucking
kids today in their electronic hologram

304
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,210
music. Pull your hands out.
When I was a kid, we had drums.

305
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:47,210
We met at an animal scannings
fucking kill those animals.

306
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:51,510
We chop those trees down. We
hauled him out, striked the
skins, made the palm palm,

307
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,800
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
But seriously, I mean, if
you think about, you know,

308
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:59,730
just how much things have changed
since you and I were kids. You know,

309
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:03,960
if you're talking to the guys 500 years
old, it's like, holy shit man. Well, yeah.

310
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:06,330
The other thing is thousand
years from now, I mean,

311
00:18:06,331 --> 00:18:09,330
if we really could live to be a thousand
years old, a thousand years from now,

312
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,540
people might not be necessary. I mean, we,

313
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:16,380
we might have evolved past this state
in some sort of a gigantic technological

314
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:21,300
leap. I really believe that when you're
looking at the iconic image of an alien,

315
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,060
you know the big heads,
the big eyes and no genitals.

316
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,360
I think we're looking at what holds us
back as organisms and what the things

317
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:34,641
that if you look at our wars and our
greed and does all the crazy fucking

318
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:39,180
larceny and crazy shit that people do,
it's all attached to the primate body.

319
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,840
You know,

320
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,840
it's all attached to sex and breeding and
greed and guilt and fear and the worry

321
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:46,830
about being mortal.

322
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,100
If we can move past that and some
genetic engineering leap or if it goes

323
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:57,090
Kurzweil on us and they developed some
insane artificial body that you transfer

324
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:00,150
your consciousness into that
it's just way more preferable.

325
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,490
You know that you got all the
buttons you can push for orgasm,

326
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,830
all the busing buttons you
can push for adventure.

327
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,850
All those exist inside your head and
they can access them at any moment,

328
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,050
but you're looking at the world
and some crazy three d, you know,

329
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,500
minority report fashion
where everything you see,

330
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,520
you're interacting with the
world in a very different way.

331
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,180
You might get a bunch of people to jump
ship and the models might get better and

332
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,910
then the next model
might be so pleasurable,

333
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,210
so much better than being a human being
that had just fucking people just start

334
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:29,760
jumping ship. Especially
English racing, you know,

335
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,160
we're fucking polluting the ocean.
Guess what?

336
00:19:32,161 --> 00:19:35,520
How about you live off photosynthesis?
We were going to cure the whole thing.

337
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,280
All right. You gotta stay the Allergen,
Kim? No, you live off the sun.

338
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,410
Incorporate somehow into the genome
or something. But somehow, and look,

339
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,270
there was a,
um,

340
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,270
a snail that I read about recently or a
slug that shifts between photosynthesis

341
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,910
and actually eating things and it eats
a certain algae and then through eating

342
00:19:56,911 --> 00:20:01,911
that algae can actually absorb life exist
off photosynthesis and this is a new

343
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:07,680
fine. So it's like colonized.
It's food and it's still alive.

344
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,620
Yeah. Yeah. That's it.

345
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,170
It's somehow or another taking
disability from its food.

346
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,680
Do you know how sea slugs have
sex? No. No, this is great.

347
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:20,100
Since you mentioned slugs, I wasn't
planning to talk about slugs today, Joe,

348
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:23,280
but since you brought it up,
a sea slugs are so interesting.

349
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,770
They're there on the bottom of the
ocean and they're just sort of wandering

350
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,650
around blind right on the bottom
of the ocean. What are those?

351
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,880
Can they see what those things? They're
like motion detectors, you know,

352
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,610
whatever antenna. Um, but
the, when to sea slugs.

353
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,640
Now Sea slugs contained both male and
female reproductive organs right inside

354
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:41,961
their bodies.

355
00:20:41,961 --> 00:20:46,961
So they've got sperm and eggs and
when to sea slugs meet each other,

356
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:48,394
they sort of

357
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,120
rear up and, and with those horn,
these horns come out of there,

358
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,930
their heads and they start slamming
each other with these horns,

359
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,690
like a couple of, you know,
mountain goats or something.

360
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,070
And eventually one of them will break
through the skin of the other with his

361
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:03,904
horn.

362
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,620
And at that point he injects
sperm into the other and he,

363
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,810
and so the other becomes female.
Well,

364
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,910
because now the eggs have been
fertilized and that one's a male. Wow.

365
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,210
So it's like when the,
they're like fighting to see
who's male and who's female,

366
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,561
which you know,

367
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:25,561
maybe reminiscent of that's
cravat school or summer camp.

368
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,710
Boy Scouts. Who's the boy? Just retreats.

369
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:35,670
Yeah, man, that's fascinating.
That's fascinating.

370
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,000
It's amazing when you see all
the different varieties of life,

371
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,690
when you see all the different forms
that it can take and then you stopped to

372
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:45,780
consider that. That's just in our,
you know, our Earth's environment.

373
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,050
Imagine like what they're going to find
if they could chip through your Ropa and

374
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,040
get to those oceans.

375
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,880
It's very possible there's something
alive under there that's being fueled from

376
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:57,060
the heat of the volcanic vents.
Most likely nothing.

377
00:21:57,061 --> 00:22:00,570
We've never seen anything in the
ocean other than like, you know,

378
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:05,470
we see like hermit crabs, they'll use
other people's, you know, in Shell. Yeah.

379
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,820
Who've never seen anything like
build a structure. Other than that,

380
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:11,820
I don't think like nothing because
nothing you could consider like, look,

381
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:15,390
there's a house, you know, like a beaver.
Beaver has a beaver den, you know,

382
00:22:15,391 --> 00:22:18,570
even it's crude as fuck, but damn,
they're building their own little house.

383
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,950
I was kind of crazy and we
obviously have insects in,

384
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:26,660
in the the world above ground that build
incredible structures and termites,

385
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:32,130
a cross section of a termite
mound. Insane. They're like
the vents for key thing.

386
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,170
Temperature leaf cutter ants.

387
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,960
Is that the one where they
filled it up with cement?

388
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,480
Uh, and they, they bring the
leaves back and then they have a,

389
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:45,350
a fungus that grows on the leaves and
that's what they eat where the termites

390
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:47,690
probably do something similar.
The termite thing I'm thinking of,

391
00:22:47,691 --> 00:22:51,590
I saw some BBC special recently and I
think it was termite mounds in Africa.

392
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,700
And what they do is like where they
have all the eggs has to be an exact

393
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:59,510
temperature and humidity and this
is in the Kalahari desert, right?

394
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,150
Which is dry and the
temperature changes a lot.

395
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:05,540
And I today and so they build these things
and they've got this chamber and then

396
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:10,541
below the Chamber are cooling fins that
that hang down perfectly spaced and the

397
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:16,820
air circulates through them so that it
keeps the temperature exactly the same

398
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,340
all the time. Wow. It's like, how does,

399
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,730
I mean there are things in
evolution that are not understood,

400
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,290
right? Like there are things where
it's like, well, there's no, um,

401
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,190
a gradual way to get from
point a to point B here.

402
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,430
How do termites know to do
that? Right? You know, that,

403
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,610
how do you encode that in DNA?

404
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,060
That doesn't seem possible
based on what we know of DNA,

405
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,220
especially since it's
an isolated incidence,

406
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,570
right? It's happening all over the
termite world. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah.

407
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:54,050
They don't communicate in a way that we
understand. Right? So the, yeah, it's,

408
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:56,930
it's very mysterious. I
think there's a, you know,

409
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:59,660
you're talking about like quantum
leaps and thinking and stuff.

410
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,030
I feel like in a strange way,

411
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,600
and I'm even hesitant to say
this publicly because of, it's a,

412
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,130
an example of what I'm talking about.

413
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,560
Like it's really hard to talk about the,

414
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,810
the areas where Darwinian notions of
evolution don't quite make it because you

415
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:23,570
immediately get lumped in with the
religious lunatics, you know what I mean?

416
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,120
So it's sort of woo woo people or,
yeah.

417
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:29,790
So it's sort of shut down an
important conversation. You know,

418
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:30,920
much like the Nazis,

419
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:33,890
I mean the Nazis were doing all this
interesting science that you can't talk

420
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:37,350
about, you know, or you can't
talk about eugenics like,

421
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,560
well that's a legitimate
thing to talk about.

422
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,490
Sure.
Everything is legitimate to talk about,

423
00:24:41,491 --> 00:24:44,070
including when you're talking
about Nazi history, right?

424
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,430
Why is that legitimate to talk about?
But eugenics as a concept,

425
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:49,530
not saying as an actual practice,
right?

426
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,840
I don't think you should take people's
lives because they're dumber than you,

427
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,260
but you could, you could encourage
some people not to reproduce. Like,

428
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,370
like people who have a
genetic, a propensity to a
certain illness, like, hey,

429
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,050
you know, maybe you should
adopt and here's a massive
tax credit if you do. Right.

430
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,340
I agree with that.
But man,

431
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,070
I don't think you should be able to tell
anybody that they can or can't breed.

432
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:14,060
I think education is,
is important with all aspects of breeding,

433
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:17,090
but we all know that people make terrible
decisions when it comes to breeding

434
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,770
because didn't want to get dead Knutsen
and, and then they're like, oh no,

435
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:24,200
I met a person. All right, now I've got
to deal with it. You know what I mean?

436
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,243
I don't think we should take it

437
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,130
got away from people just because they
have diseases or forced them to get an

438
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:29,810
abortion or if,
you know,

439
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:34,760
the also one valid point that
people have illnesses say is, um,

440
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,270
I don't want anyone else
to have the illness that I
have, but I'm alive and I'm,

441
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,880
I'm okay. And I have, you know,
cerebral palsy and I have,
you know, whatever I have,

442
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,390
you know, and I can still enjoy
life. It might not be perfect,

443
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:49,310
but you're telling me
that this experience,

444
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:52,580
my experience in life because I have
cerebral palsy or because I have something

445
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:56,540
else is not valid. And I'm saying that's
wrong. I'm hampered, I'm hindered.

446
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,600
I've certainly can't move the way a
regular person moves. Right? However,

447
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,720
my experience is my experience and I
can make the most of it and I enjoy it.

448
00:26:02,721 --> 00:26:05,270
And I'm not necessarily
trying to give a child,

449
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,260
but I'm not trying to invalid
argument for that. Okay.

450
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,070
Right. But okay, but let's look
at the counter argument, right?

451
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:13,620
Because the assumption there is you're,
as you said,

452
00:26:13,621 --> 00:26:17,730
you're invalidating my experience
but looked at from another way.

453
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,660
Well what are we comparing that
experience to where we're experienced?

454
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:26,370
We're comparing it to nothing. We're
not, we're not comparing it to,

455
00:26:26,371 --> 00:26:29,340
you know, you should die. You should
be, you know what we're saying?

456
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,550
Nothing right now.
How do you compare it to nothing.

457
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,930
A kid who isn't born isn't suffering.
Right.

458
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:42,240
So I mean, I think that the, the
assumption, I've got a cousin,

459
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:44,100
this really smart kid,
he's like

460
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,460
five or something. And the other
day he was talking about how he, uh,

461
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,420
before he was born,

462
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:53,370
he was saying that all
fetuses should have um, uh,

463
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,890
iPads but, but no password. Right.
Cause cause they wouldn't understand it.

464
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,960
It's like five I think. And it's cause
it's boring, you know, being a veto.

465
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,830
Right. And I was like, well, my aunt was
talking to him and, and uh, he said, uh,

466
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,920
she said, well, where were you
when you were a fetus? He said, uh,

467
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,670
I was a sleepy dead. And he
like sleepy dead. He, yeah,

468
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,010
it's not like dead when you die.
It's,

469
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,250
it's dead before you're born and you're
kind of sleepy, so sleepy, dead, whoa.

470
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,570
And like, okay, yeah, this
is, it's kind of a genius kid.

471
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,700
What does that kid actually know?

472
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:29,340
Something what if you remember some shit
that we forgot? I'll tell you. I mean,

473
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:32,280
this is gonna sound crazy,
but I remembered when I was a kid,

474
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:35,700
I remembered you remembered
what I remembered the,

475
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,270
the feeling of where I came
from before I was born.

476
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,740
And what happened was,
and this is a weird thing,

477
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:47,190
I was just talking to [inaudible]
about this recently. Um,

478
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,320
I remembered it as it general,
uh, how can I say this?

479
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:56,700
Like, what I remember is
as I got older, as a kid,

480
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,110
I remember thinking,
I'm losing this memory.

481
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,340
I'm losing contact with something.
I know.

482
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,170
And as my consciousness was getting
more sort of aware as a, uh,

483
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,540
as a person, right. Uh,

484
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,810
I realized that that was a really
valuable thing that I was losing.

485
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,550
And so as I was like
12, 13, 14, I was like,

486
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,930
I have to remember this. I, I knew,
I wouldn't remember it as a memory.

487
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:29,490
So I was creating like a,
a record of it that I would remember,

488
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,560
if that makes any sense to, you know
what I mean? Like, I know, you know,

489
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,300
it's like people who have,
um, I forget what it's called,

490
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:40,850
where they don't recognize faces,
like, uh, that all Oliver sacks,

491
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,160
the neurologist has that and he describes
it and one of his books and he's like,

492
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,080
they've got this face blindness.

493
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,060
So what they'll do is if they're having
a conversation with you and they're

494
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,460
going to go to the bathroom and they
know they're going to come back,

495
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,960
they'll be like,
okay,

496
00:28:54,961 --> 00:28:59,500
the guy with the blue shirt and the
thing and the tattoos is Joe, you know,

497
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,000
just to create a record in his head
and then we'll go to the bathroom.

498
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:06,350
So when he comes back, he'll
remember your Joe. Wow. Yeah. It's a,

499
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:08,430
it's a really interesting
neurological thing.

500
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,670
I would like to see that guy
draw a picture of a face. Yeah.

501
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:14,610
I wonder if they would want to, how
that works. Do you know Oliver Sacks?

502
00:29:14,611 --> 00:29:19,500
He would be an amazing guest. Know don't
know. I don't know who he is. Yeah,

503
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,820
I've heard of him actually described that.
I forgot what show was listening to,

504
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:26,370
but he was actually describing
that issue. Yeah. Not,

505
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,480
not knowing what people's
faces necessarily look
like. Yeah. I think I just,

506
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,500
it's hard to imagine it is,

507
00:29:34,501 --> 00:29:36,930
right because it's something
that's so automatic to us.

508
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,830
He also wrote a book about
Hallucinogens Hallucinations,

509
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,310
which was very interesting

510
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:46,990
because it was the first, this came
out maybe five years ago and it was,

511
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,780
it struck me as the
first like main stream,

512
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,460
a sort of non apologetic discussion
of the use of hallucinogens by a very

513
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:01,450
mainstream doctor who's written all these
bestsellers and he talks about when he

514
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:05,620
lived in Topanga in the 60s and he
took some acid. Of course he did.

515
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,750
You have to get in there exactly what
to go to the farmers and the gate.

516
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,050
That place is ridiculous.

517
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,190
I was looking at a house that once and
he's fucking hippies talked me out of

518
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,080
even looking any further.
They were like, uh,

519
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,660
like the house had a tax court behind
it. They're like, if you buy the house,

520
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,270
you're going to let the community use
a tennis court. Right. I go, what?

521
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,450
That's right under my bed. Like
get the fuck Outta here. No,

522
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,820
I'm not going to let you carry you.
Fucking people are too much.

523
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,520
Imagine all these dirty hippies
showing up Sunday morning.

524
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:34,800
You're trying to sleep in here.
Boop, boop, boop. Hey man,
that was inbound. It's new.

525
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:39,310
It wasn't man. You should share
the score, you know. Fuck you.

526
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:42,790
It was good. You said like the
California and the Saturday night live.

527
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,130
That's them doing. I know. It's so true.

528
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,790
I want to go back to what you were saying
though. Like your, your memory of, um,

529
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,190
of B before you were born. You know, I was
listening to this, a radio lab podcast.

530
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:57,820
I know that I've said that about a million
times. If you're playing the podcast,

531
00:30:57,821 --> 00:30:59,140
drinking games,
time to have a shot,

532
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,300
because I listen to that
podcast all the time,

533
00:31:01,301 --> 00:31:05,740
but they were talking about memories
and how poor people's memories truly are

534
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,920
and how many people believe that they
have an idea in their head that's carved

535
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:16,600
in stone. This is what
happened. But if you, if you
look at the, the actual events,

536
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:20,260
the provable actual events in comparison
to their idea, what happened, right?

537
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,290
Oftentimes they're way off, you know,
courts or Tara. Horrible. Yeah, yeah.

538
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,840
La often people see that when they go
back to where they grew up, you know,

539
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,060
and you go back to your home
and your house looks smaller,

540
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,990
everything looks different.
It's just like, wow. It's
like, oh, it's like someone,

541
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:39,010
he made a replica of where you grew up
but did a shitty job because they didn't

542
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:43,750
have all the data. Did you
ever feel betrayed when you
had that experience? No. No,

543
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:48,460
no. I, the opposite for me, when I went
back to where I grew up, it was amazing.

544
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,960
I took my, uh, my wife and my kids and
we walked through the neighborhood.

545
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:54,460
There wasn't even a neighborhood.

546
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,150
I lived across the street from the Charles
River and this is big park like area

547
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,900
and uh, I would go fishing, um, down the
river. There was like this pond. It was,

548
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,630
I would catch bass at and I took them on
these walks that I used to take through

549
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:10,210
the woods and I was like,
this is a crazy spot to grow up.

550
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:14,440
I didn't realize how weird it was. I grew
up near this place called echo bridge.

551
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,230
And Echo Bridge is in a place
called Newton upper falls.

552
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,190
And I had a waterfall across the
street from my house and I never,

553
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,070
never realized like how cool this was
until I took the kids there and walked

554
00:32:24,071 --> 00:32:26,230
around. I was like, wow,
this is a wild place to be.

555
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,220
Like all the places where I used to hang
out with my friends and just, you know,

556
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,210
it's nice and it wasn't all built up. It
was still there. Still like that. Yeah.

557
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,110
I mean it's the hemlock gorge reservation.
That's the area.

558
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:40,100
I think it's preserved.
That sounds

559
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,461
nice.

560
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:43,700
I always imagine you like inner city
cause I remember you talking about rough

561
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:44,720
neighborhoods and stuff.

562
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,040
I lived in Newton from the time I was 14
to the time I was 17 or a toilet time.

563
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:52,840
I was a, well that was
high school, you know,

564
00:32:52,841 --> 00:32:56,440
14 to 17 and then like a year and a half,
two years after that I stayed there.

565
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,310
But before that I lived in a place called
Jamaica Plain. Jamaica plain was rough,

566
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,170
but we only lived there for about a year
and a half, maybe two years at the most.

567
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:10,120
But I went to high school or Grammar
School in this, uh, I think it was curly.

568
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:13,060
I think that was the name of the
grammar school. But it was bad man.

569
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,960
It was real bad. It was Jamaica
plain is become more gentrified now.

570
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,520
But when I lived there in 1979,
1980,

571
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:22,840
I guess it was somewhere around then.

572
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:26,920
I think my first year of high school
was 81 it was a, it was really bad.

573
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,530
There was a lot of like
bad shit going down.

574
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:32,890
There was 17 year old kids that
were in the seventh grade, you know,

575
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:35,870
they would like never graduated
and like you'd be, you know,

576
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,920
I was like a little kid and I was going
to class and it was just fucking full

577
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:41,530
grown adults that are in my class.
You know,

578
00:33:41,531 --> 00:33:44,890
there's guys and girls making out in
the back of the class was all these like

579
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,240
inner city kids like they were.

580
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:50,780
So I come from Florida where I lived
before that in a college community in

581
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:51,730
Gainesville,
Florida.

582
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,110
And we moved to like the only place in
Boston that my parents could afford and

583
00:33:56,111 --> 00:33:58,690
it was this Jamaica plain place and
they worked really hard to get us out of

584
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:02,410
there and moved us to Newton and
Newton was like way more urban,

585
00:34:02,411 --> 00:34:06,730
way more relaxed but Jamaica plain
was fucking scooter. It was sketchy.

586
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:10,200
There's a lot of crime like w there's
breaking and enterings in our,

587
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:12,520
in our neighborhood all the time.
You know,

588
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:16,210
like we got a dog just to bark to let
us know if someone is trying to get into

589
00:34:16,211 --> 00:34:17,680
the house.
It was very weird.

590
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,770
It was a weird place to live and then
Newton was a total different planets.

591
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:24,660
Cool. That's something you and I
have in common. Moving as kids.

592
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:27,660
I moved a lot as a kid.
I went to call my three high schools.

593
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,800
It's real common with people that
are interesting for whatever reason.

594
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:33,511
Yeah.

595
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:38,490
I mean I have a younger sister and
she and I sort of dealt with it in

596
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:42,420
diametrically opposed ways.
Like she um,

597
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:46,380
had developed a real need
to be part of the community.

598
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:49,650
So as soon as we moved to it,
we then Jacksonville for example,

599
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,010
as soon as we were in Jacksonville, she
developed the local accent within a week.

600
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,130
You know, I never developed
any accent. I sort of,

601
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:00,210
I became the pedantic arrogant asshole
who doesn't need friends. You know?

602
00:35:00,211 --> 00:35:02,790
That's how I dealt with
it. Right. You know? Okay.

603
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:06,210
I mean I got used to eating alone
in the lunch room, you know,

604
00:35:06,211 --> 00:35:09,690
like reading a book. Like I got my book,
I'll ignore the rest of you fuckers.

605
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,650
I mean, I made friends, but the,
the point was that I didn't, like,

606
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:17,250
I wasn't reaching out, you
know, I was trying to be,

607
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,670
and then that worked great in the,
you know, the rest of my life.

608
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:24,890
Traveling all the time, living overseas,
all that. I don't have a home. And you're,

609
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:28,380
you're like this too. Right? You
move enough. It's like, well, okay,

610
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:30,780
I lived here for a couple of years.
I lived here for a couple of years.

611
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:33,630
But when people say don't you
miss your home, all your friends,

612
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:38,010
the people you grew up with. I don't
know the people I grew with, you know,

613
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,090
there was stages.

614
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,130
I'm still friends with a couple guys
from high school. Really? Yeah. Yeah,

615
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:47,280
me too. Yeah. One guy from high
school, actually I have two,

616
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,710
two buddies from high school that we
talk. One that I'm pretty close with. Uh,

617
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,140
I saw him last when I was
in Boston and, um, you know,

618
00:35:55,141 --> 00:35:58,050
we've known each other since we were
like 14, so it's, it's weird, you know.

619
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,430
[inaudible] now he has grown kids and
we went to dinner with him and his kids,

620
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,840
his daughters like in her twenties.
I'm like, this is crazy, man.

621
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:08,700
You gotta you know, I've known his wife
forever too. It's uh, it's interesting to,

622
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:12,690
to see, uh, he, he grew up in that
neighborhood. He lived there and you know,

623
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,810
we became friends when I moved
into the neighborhood. But, um,

624
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,650
almost all my friends like Joey,
Ari,

625
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,530
like all these guys moved all over the
place. You know, Dunkin, um, you know,

626
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,600
Brian Collins the worst, not
the worst, I shouldn't say,

627
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,810
but the most experienced because he
lived in Saudi Arabia, his family,

628
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,940
his family was involved in international
finance and so he lived in all these

629
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:38,400
crazy Middle Eastern countries.
He lived in Afghanistan.

630
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:42,400
I believe that's a whole different level.
Oh, he lived everywhere, man. Yeah. And,

631
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,640
but he's one of the most interesting
people I know because of that.

632
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:45,474
It's just like he,

633
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,920
there's pros and cons I think definitely
there's like a definitely like a more

634
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:53,430
calming confidence of growing up in a
neighborhood where you know all the people

635
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:56,280
and you can, but there's also like
a limiting aspect to that too,

636
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:59,880
especially if it goes wrong.
You know, like if she gets
on the neighborhood right,

637
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:03,450
and I assure you the bad neighborhood or
if you get labeled as like a person in

638
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:06,670
the neighborhood with the cancer ostracize
or they get mad at you for something,

639
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,440
right? Yeah. It's like you redefine
yourself when you move to new places.

640
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:13,290
That's what the new girl,
she's a new girl. Where's she
from? She's from Portland.

641
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,870
Oh, did she smell like feet?
You know, like you see her,

642
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:19,500
she's wearing the grand dress.
She's got a truly honor. Thank dude.

643
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,210
She's got oh good. I got assigned
a guy. You're the fucking,

644
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,250
I'm the Lloyd Guy. I mean, everyone
always likes, I like Petrouli.

645
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:32,190
I like prune juice. I mean, I
know it's a joke, but it's like,

646
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:36,420
it tastes good for your body to get,
makes you shit or not shit.

647
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:39,450
I don't even know. I know what
affect shit somehow, but I mean,

648
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,040
I just like the flavor and
put truly smells good to me.
It's not the worst smell.

649
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,310
I like incense. That's a very hippie
thing. People get angry at you.

650
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,860
You don't like the smell of incense?

651
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,850
Not if they're anything but
nug Champa I like the nug.

652
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:57,460
Champa some stuff laying around
here somewhere right there tonight.

653
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,170
This one smells good. Yeah,
I'm sure it'll be fine. Yeah.

654
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,230
Hey, shout out to Dunkin. I feel shouting
out. White people shouting out. Well,

655
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:09,700
you mentioned Dunkin and,
and you know when I,

656
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,720
I tweeted that I was going to be on
the show. Everyone's like, oh you,

657
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:15,810
you and Joe and Duncan. Oh
yeah. Dot. Can couldn't make it.

658
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:20,100
He's in big Sur live in the time. It was
like, fucker. He likes it up there. Oh,

659
00:38:20,101 --> 00:38:22,620
he loved it. Good. He's trying to
talk me into buying a house. Dude.

660
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,080
I'll watch your house. What a favor. He,

661
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:31,080
he'd be doing you. Yeah, I would do
that too. I would totally trust him.

662
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,300
It's pretty cool up there.
I mean that's,

663
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,070
it's a very unusual place because
you can't really support a large

664
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,010
population.
It's like you can only live in or out.

665
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,740
You're kind of butted up against the
mountain. Yeah. The water's right there.

666
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:42,730
It's like this is all you got.

667
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,990
You spend time at Esselyn ever
talking about hippies? No, I did. Um,

668
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,380
I was invited to do a workshop there.
How's that smell? Is that okay?

669
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,470
I don't even smell it yet. He'll
smell that's going that way. Damn.

670
00:38:53,471 --> 00:38:55,600
What's wrong with you?
Around what you know, son,

671
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:58,030
you should smell the fuck out of
that. Oh, there it is. How's that?

672
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,460
It's nice sunny show. Don't lie
to me, man. I'll put it right out.

673
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,910
I haven't really noticed that. I tell you.
I mean, I don't, it must be the coke. Oh,

674
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:08,140
sorry. How dare you? That's a bad drug.

675
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,840
Don't understand it. That's a
drug I had access. I mean you're,

676
00:39:12,841 --> 00:39:15,430
you're in this position all the
time, I'm sure. But you know,

677
00:39:15,431 --> 00:39:18,460
having access to like the
best of the best of something.

678
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,290
I knew a guy in college who was the
son of an oil minister from a country,

679
00:39:23,291 --> 00:39:27,220
I won't name, just to keep me out
of trouble. He had a private jet,

680
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,320
he used to fly to Columbia.

681
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,530
He had a diplomatic bag so he could
bring anything into the country.

682
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,300
He bring this shit into the country
and he was like in this frat and I knew

683
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:40,390
someone who was in the Frat and
I was never a frat boy at all.

684
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:45,340
But they would invite me and like,
he's like yellow rocks of coke,

685
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,410
you know, and like, and it was the,

686
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,500
I mean I went to this dumb ass
college where everybody was rich.

687
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:55,501
So the drug scene there was off the
charts and like I've done the best coke

688
00:39:55,931 --> 00:40:00,340
there is. Right. I mean, I know the guy
who invented them, Dma, I, you know,

689
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:01,061
it's like I've got,

690
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:06,061
I had these really good connections for
drugs and coke sucks the best coke in

691
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:13,810
the war. Shit, don't get it. Wow.

692
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,140
I mean, my, my sense is that it,

693
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:22,380
it affects a certain personality structure
in a really pleasant way and I don't

694
00:40:22,871 --> 00:40:26,920
have that structure. So for
me hallucinogens are like
boom, that's pushing my,

695
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:31,930
my button, right. Coke, it just made
me fucking nervous and drink too much.

696
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,690
Well you're a self

697
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,690
deprecating guy and you joke around about
a lot and you also introspective and I

698
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:41,450
think that one of the things that people
don't like about people that are coked

699
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:44,630
up is that they want to
talk about themselves.

700
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:48,320
They want to tell you how fucking
bad ass they are. They want to brag,

701
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,960
they want to,
they want to talk about like making money.

702
00:40:50,961 --> 00:40:53,870
We're going to buy this forest, we're
going to fucking, you know, like,

703
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,351
you know what I mean?

704
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:58,950
Like Mike Young used to always talk about
how people in on coke always want to

705
00:40:58,951 --> 00:41:02,780
start a business with you
because it's really kind of true.

706
00:41:02,781 --> 00:41:05,030
It's like they always have these awesome,
yeah,

707
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:08,690
they have these crazy
grand plans and it just, I,

708
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:13,550
I've never been interested in it. I
got lucky and I ducked it. I was a kid,

709
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:15,770
I've told the story a hundred times,
but I had a friend,

710
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,390
my friend that I'm still
friends with in high school,

711
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,750
his cousin used to sell
it and he turned his life,

712
00:41:20,751 --> 00:41:23,000
went down the toilet and
I watched him wither away.

713
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,150
Lost like a shitload of
weight became weird, you know,

714
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,370
just always on coke and when it warrants,
it wasn't on coke,

715
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:31,390
he was just exhausted, you know,
it's just like Jesus that looks like,

716
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,970
like no one is someone who got
bit a vampire. Like, oh my God.

717
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,160
Like you got you get
that bug that got you.

718
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:37,810
Yeah.

719
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,440
It's like you're taking all the energy
from party or life and concentrating it

720
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,750
in the few hours after
you do the coke and like,

721
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,540
well what are you gonna do with all
that energy except irritate people.

722
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,040
But I knew a girl and she was a
great girl. She wasn't a mean person.

723
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,260
She wasn't nasty materialistic.
She's beautiful.

724
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:56,520
She's really nice and sweet and kind.
But fuck, she loved coke. God Damn.

725
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,160
And she would feel bad about it.
She got fucking love it.

726
00:41:59,161 --> 00:42:01,030
I love doing coke and be like really?
Like what?

727
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,680
I was not curious enough to want to
do it but listening to her, you know,

728
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:08,220
she knew it was bad news. She shouldn't
do it, didn't want to do it anymore,

729
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:11,280
but she'd tell you God damn and
I'm doing it. I love doing coke.

730
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,560
In my experience,

731
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:17,360
the people who tend to get really
hooked on coke are people who have um,

732
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,680
issues with uh,
they feel bad about themselves.

733
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,580
They feel they've got a lack of
self esteem. They feel like they,

734
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,410
they're not good enough.
They're not whatever.

735
00:42:27,411 --> 00:42:30,390
There's shame and all that because
the coke takes that away for awhile.

736
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,270
That totally makes sense in
this case because this woman,

737
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,740
her mother was like really overbearing
and her mother was like Super Alpha

738
00:42:38,741 --> 00:42:43,660
successful, right? Her mother was
a single mom and was like, like,

739
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:47,560
no man is going to fucking run me
and show she was a lawyer and she is,

740
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,270
she ran successful business.

741
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:54,100
She had a law firm and she was like super
like intense with her daughter about

742
00:42:54,101 --> 00:42:57,940
achievement, about pursuing things, about,
you know, don't eat the wrong foods. And,

743
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,880
you know,
and he just,

744
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,380
it was like really like overbearing and
gave her a hard time about her weight.

745
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,590
Like, you're too fat, you're never
going to be a model and like, Ooh.

746
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,480
And so I guess the coke was like, ah,
free. You don't have to think about it.

747
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,770
Give her like, maybe she had a deficit
created by her mom's constant, you know,

748
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:19,080
I just never letting her just be
herself then. You ever, you know,

749
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,620
Gabo motto is no, he's a bore Montana.
Yeah, I know. It didn't know the name.

750
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,840
I've only seen it written.

751
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,420
Yeah, he's, he's a cool guy. And if
you ever want to have him on the show,

752
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:31,510
let me know. He's, he's a friend of
mine. He's a very interesting guy.

753
00:43:31,511 --> 00:43:35,440
He's a doctor who works with addicts
and he's been working with addicts in

754
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:39,250
Vancouver and like the slum part
of Vancouver for a long time.

755
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:42,220
A lot of like real down and out people.
Um,

756
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:47,200
and he also is very interested
in alternative approaches
to addiction. And Eh,

757
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:52,150
you know, he's written about Iowasca
as a way of dealing with addiction,

758
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:55,630
treating addicts and all
that. Um, but anyway, he, uh,

759
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:00,640
his theory is that all addiction
is due to trauma. It's not,

760
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:03,430
it has nothing to do with the
substance or the activity. It's,

761
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:08,100
that's just how it manifests, right?
But it's all about psychological trauma.

762
00:44:08,101 --> 00:44:12,130
It's all trying to alleviate
suffering of some point of some kind.

763
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,680
And um, it's interesting,
his research, uh,

764
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,700
sort of meshes very well with this
experiment that was done also in British

765
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,640
Columbia. I can't remember. Williamson
I think was the scientist's name.

766
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,940
You know those famous studies
where they give rats like a,

767
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:31,350
they've got a water bottle,
it's just water.

768
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:35,040
And then another one that's got coke in
it and the rats will just keep doing the

769
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:37,890
coke and they'll forget to eat. And
then the, the, you know, like die,

770
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:40,590
like these people you're talking about
lost all this weight and then just like

771
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,480
completely focused.
This guy looked at that and he,

772
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,030
he was a professor scientist. He looked
at that and he's like, okay, well that,

773
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:53,031
that's the sort of main study that
everybody cites that shows that coke is

774
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:56,340
addictive and it's coke that causes
the problem and it's the substance.

775
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:57,960
And molecular problems.

776
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,490
But what if we took those
rats a same kind of rats,

777
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,940
but instead of just being in a
cage where there's nothing to do,

778
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,600
put them in a really interesting
environment where there are lots of other

779
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:10,111
options.

780
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:14,190
There are lots of other rats they're tubes
to go through and things to climb and

781
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:18,510
things to hide under and lots of
stimulation, right? And then let's try it.

782
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,640
They try it.
What happens?

783
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,030
The rats do the coke once or twice and
then walk away from it. Never go back.

784
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,590
Right.

785
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,970
So there's an argument to be made that
a strong argument that it's not about

786
00:45:29,971 --> 00:45:33,090
substances. It's like I was saying,
it's about the way this substance,

787
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,660
inner sex with whatever your
particular suffering is,

788
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,251
right?

789
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:40,340
So these rats in a cage are obviously
suffering because they're not in a natural

790
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:41,690
environment or in a fucking cage.

791
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:44,480
There's nothing to do except
like get high so they get high.

792
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,830
That's a very good point
that I never considered. That
is a very, very good point.

793
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:52,720
It's called rat park. If anyone wants
to Google it, just Google rat park.

794
00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:54,520
Cause that's what he called this,
you know,

795
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,200
like sort of enclosure
that he made for them.

796
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,780
Imagine being a rat,

797
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,800
being stuck in a fucking fluorescent
lighting room and fucking metal cage and a

798
00:46:03,881 --> 00:46:06,820
little water bottle. You got
suck on big too. I mean, look,

799
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,910
the fucking life they live is dog
shit. Yeah. You're in a prison.

800
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:14,080
So imagine you got, you got to prison,
the guy in solitary confinement, right.

801
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,300
And you're offering them to get high.

802
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:20,170
Of course it's going to get high and
you're being surrounded by giants

803
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:21,881
everywhere you go.

804
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:25,990
This is enormous creatures who can easily
reach in and just snuff your life out

805
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:30,190
of my squeezing. Ridiculous. And
by nature you're terrified, right.

806
00:46:30,191 --> 00:46:32,490
Cause you're a prey animal.
You're, you know, yeah.

807
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,230
You should be running from everything
and all of a sudden you can't run.

808
00:46:35,231 --> 00:46:36,960
You can't hide. Right. Change.

809
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,900
And they just reach in and grab you
and they fucking give you a coke. Yeah.

810
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,990
Which makes it even
more pair fucking shit.

811
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,120
God Damn Pita might have a point.

812
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:52,720
I interviewed this guy recently
talking about animal stuff. He, uh,

813
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,800
he was doing his phd in,
uh,

814
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:58,450
University of Pennsylvania and
he was working in psychology,

815
00:46:58,451 --> 00:47:02,200
but there were chimps involved in
his research and so they, like,

816
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:03,370
they would come in to these cages,

817
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:06,730
but they had this big area outside
back behind the cages. Right.

818
00:47:06,731 --> 00:47:10,570
We're so like at night they would go hang
out and there were trees and stuff and

819
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:15,370
whatever. And so this is in the,
I guess, 60s or 70s. And, uh,

820
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,080
so he would hang out until everybody
went home and he was alone.

821
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,770
And then he'd sneak back into
the area where the chimps where,

822
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:27,190
where he wasn't allowed.
Nobody was allowed or I like
walking around with chimps,

823
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,070
but he was like, fuck it. If they kill
me, I think they'll kill me. No problem.

824
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,740
So he was a Hippie, right. Um,

825
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:36,640
actually he's the guy who now owns this
chain of Paleo restaurants in Portland.

826
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:40,840
Really cool guy. Richard.
Um, figures. Yeah.

827
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,650
He opened the first mountain
bike shop in the country.

828
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:45,940
He's a very good businessman.

829
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:50,980
Then he opened like he went to Portland
because you wanted to be in a place

830
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:54,880
where you could get all your
supplies for a restaurant,

831
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:57,640
all the food within a hundred mile radius.

832
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,270
And he studied all over the country
and he said, Portland supplies,

833
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,280
everything can be grown
within a hundred miles.

834
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,870
He sort of was ahead of the mountain
biking craze that he was ahead of the sort

835
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:11,700
of farm to table thing.
And he opened a chain called,

836
00:48:11,701 --> 00:48:16,200
I'm laughing planet, which there
were like 15 or 20 of these uh, uh,

837
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:20,920
like vegetarian burrito shops
in Portland sold that, uh,

838
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,180
cause he had quintuple bypass surgery
and he thought he was going to die,

839
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:29,800
sold that, bought this
beautiful farm where he grows
stuff now it's just amazing.

840
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,630
Quintuple bypass surgery and he's a Vegan
mountain biker. He was a vegetarian,

841
00:48:34,631 --> 00:48:38,290
not Vegan, but he was a vegetarian.
And so that's what he said. He's like,

842
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,040
I work out, I'm eating vegetarian
for 20 years. What the fuck?

843
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,190
And he started reading about like,
wait a minute,

844
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,870
this idea of low fat is bullshit,
wasn't taking healthy fats.

845
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,030
He didn't know, you know. So now he's
shifted to Paleo and now he's opened like,

846
00:48:55,031 --> 00:48:58,750
you know, he's got this expanding
business of Paleo restaurants anyway,

847
00:48:58,751 --> 00:48:59,560
what am I talking?
Oh,

848
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,120
so he would go back with these chimps
and he told this hilarious story where

849
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:06,520
he's with his champion. He'd let
go back there and, and you know,

850
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:09,030
smoke a joint at the end of the day
and the chimps are wondering. Right.

851
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,240
And one day this Jim comes over and
sits down next to him and he's smoking a

852
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:16,360
joint and the chimp reached,
no,

853
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:20,980
he has not get this champion.
The joke to the gym. No,

854
00:49:20,981 --> 00:49:22,390
it just hits it.
It gives it

855
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:27,110
back to, oh my God, that would be
the greatest video ever on youtube.

856
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,070
But Dude, get this is one of a chimp
fucking a frog. Have you ever seen,

857
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:35,940
I have seen that. It's kind of
sad. Yeah. Not for the chimp but,

858
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:41,770
but one of a chimp smoking a joint with
a dude, especially a hippie. Right.

859
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,900
Will be the ultimate. Don't
bug or don't bog. Right it man.

860
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:47,030
And if he did Bogart or what
are you going to do? You know,

861
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,180
like give the chimp that
joint shut the fuck. Exactly.
Rips your arms off. Exactly.

862
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:54,560
And a high, what's a high chimp light?
You know, probably pretty mellow.

863
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,170
It's like a, it's like a paranoid,
right? Like how do you know?

864
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,640
Well that's another thing.
We were talking about rats being in cages.

865
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,460
I got super high ones and I wrote a,

866
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:07,090
a a piece way back a long time ago.

867
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,420
My blog before my 2009 special,
before I started podcasting,

868
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:15,350
I used to write a lot and put it up in
blog form and one of the things I wrote

869
00:50:15,351 --> 00:50:15,950
about is it,

870
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:19,730
it's called animal prison and became like
the foundation for a lot of jokes that

871
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:23,480
I want to use and some of my specials,
but it was about getting high.

872
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:27,860
I got really high once and I went to the
zoo and I was super depressed. Yeah. Not,

873
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,450
you know,
me personally in my personal life.

874
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:34,280
But being at the zoo stoned made me
like really like, especially edibles,

875
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:34,791
you know,

876
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:38,330
I had eaten a pot something or another
cookie or something like that and I was

877
00:50:38,331 --> 00:50:43,190
like really fucked up about this. I'm
like, this is just not fair. It's not,

878
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:45,350
it doesn't,
it's like it's cruel,

879
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:49,010
it's cruel and it's cruel in a way were
insensitive to, and the joke was like,

880
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:52,520
hey man, you know, I watched the
chimps, they were playing with the tire,

881
00:50:52,521 --> 00:50:54,770
swinging around, lifted, they're
having a good time. And I'm like, yeah,

882
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,180
well you can go to prison,

883
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,990
you'll see dudes playing basketball and
it doesn't mean it's awesome. You know,

884
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,930
like people do what they have to do
and they're in prison to have fun,

885
00:51:02,931 --> 00:51:04,220
but they don't want to be there.

886
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,640
And that's the same thing that these
animals that didn't like the idea that

887
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,920
somehow or another their sit being saved.

888
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,270
I guess we're supposed to accept that
they're doing conservation work for sure.

889
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:14,811
And that's,

890
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:18,460
some of these animals can only exist in
captivity in this day and age or, or,

891
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:20,510
or at least we have to have
some of them in captivity.

892
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:24,560
To ensure their survival because humans
are pushing in on their area where they

893
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:27,530
live. But fuck man, that's,
especially with intelligent animals.

894
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,700
That's depressing as shit.

895
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,920
Yeah. I've got a friend, I just did
a podcast with him the other day.

896
00:51:32,921 --> 00:51:37,921
He's a sort of been hired
by the whole marine mammal,

897
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,800
the consortium to try to help them deal
with their image problem from black fish

898
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:46,180
and blah blah blah.
Right.

899
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,900
So we were talking about this and he's
been working a lot in this place in

900
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:54,360
Florida where the dolphins are
used for therapeutic, you know,

901
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,600
with like,
um,

902
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:59,470
vets with PTSD and the kids
who are autistic and stuff.

903
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:04,471
And the Dolphin seem to
have a real sensitivity and
there's an interaction and a

904
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:07,840
lot of them were born in captivity.
If you let him loose,

905
00:52:07,841 --> 00:52:11,230
they'd be dead within hours, you know,
they don't know how to survive and stuff.

906
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,510
Um, but anyway, we were talking about this
and you know, I said like, okay, you know,

907
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,070
what are you going to do about the,

908
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:22,120
I understand he has good arguments about
the dolphins and the smaller animals,

909
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,750
but like what are you going to do
about the Orca is man, you know, how,

910
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,660
how do you fix that? And he's like,
he said, there's no way to fix that.

911
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:33,010
Like they just should not be there because
you can't build an enclosure that is

912
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:37,750
even arguably big enough and interesting
enough for them and they leave their

913
00:52:37,751 --> 00:52:41,200
social so you can't just have one. You
got to have like 15 of them, you know,

914
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:44,710
they're very community based animals.
So license isn't it

915
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,800
possible that they could
take an area in a bay,

916
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:52,860
like a very large area and take all the
worlds captive orcas and transport them

917
00:52:53,051 --> 00:52:54,400
to this large bay,

918
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:58,520
like take a large area and a part of
the world that we don't go but it's

919
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:03,280
habitable and habitable for
them. And then, you know, fence,

920
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:04,780
something off underwater,

921
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:09,781
spend a lot of money to fix this issue
and then slowly but surely reintroduced

922
00:53:09,841 --> 00:53:12,970
them to the wild.
Give them a steady source of food,

923
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,320
like provide them with food
and then provide them with
food that's you'd have to

924
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:20,080
catch like give them more and more food.

925
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:22,600
That's like you're going to let
it to go or whatever it is. Yeah,

926
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:24,310
habituate them and make it a project.

927
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,470
I don't buy idea that it's impossible to
take them and let them live in the wild.

928
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:32,730
You can take a 40 year old man and teach
them how to go forage through the woods.

929
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,950
I mean look at survivor man,
that fucking guy,

930
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,470
he taught himself how to do that shit.

931
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,770
He can exist for months at a time during
the wilderness and there's a lot of

932
00:53:40,771 --> 00:53:43,980
people that do that. They have survival
skills. I guess what we call it.

933
00:53:43,981 --> 00:53:47,520
We used to call hunting and
gathering is now survival skills.

934
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:52,200
It's not just existing as
a person foraging for food
like people used to do for

935
00:53:52,201 --> 00:53:56,070
fucking untold thousands of years.
I think you could teach orchids,

936
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,310
but it would have to take a long time.
Been a huge cost, a lot of money,

937
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,560
but you owe that to the fucking orcas.
Man.

938
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:05,830
Agree. I agree. But you know,
we're not, we're not. Yeah.

939
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,920
We get into what we owe to
other, you know, being sure
to say never ending. I mean,

940
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:13,930
Peter Singer, you know him.
No, he wrote animal liberation,

941
00:54:13,931 --> 00:54:18,931
which sort of started the whole animal
rights frenzy and the 70s whenever it was

942
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:23,830
really interesting. Philosopher
teaches at Princeton now I think. Um,

943
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:28,330
and he made a really interesting arctic
argument about using primates in drug

944
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:32,730
testing. And because, you
know, the argument there is,
well, they're close to humans,

945
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:36,370
so their responses to
pharmaceuticals and things is,

946
00:54:36,371 --> 00:54:40,690
is as close as we're going to
get for our own testing. And, uh,

947
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,123
what he said,

948
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,970
he's one of these guys who just thinks
really clearly wherever it goes,

949
00:54:45,971 --> 00:54:50,830
and he doesn't give a shit. And
so his argument was, um, okay,

950
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,310
uh,

951
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:56,310
chimpanzee has the intelligence and sort
of a demonstrable awareness of a three

952
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,880
or four year old kid. So
they're, they're beings.

953
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:03,400
They're thinking they're experiencing,
they've got emotions,

954
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,970
they've got relationships. There's
no question. Right. They're not fish.

955
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,720
They're not, you know. Um,

956
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,280
and every year thousands of babies
are born with no brain with,

957
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:18,160
I forget the technical, the
medical term for it, but they just,

958
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:21,970
their brain never developed in the fetus
and they're born and housing. Really?

959
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,120
Yeah. Maybe it's hundreds.
I don't know. But a lot. Um,

960
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:30,190
and his point was these babies are
all going to die. They are born,

961
00:55:30,191 --> 00:55:32,760
they put him on these machines,
keep them going there.

962
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:37,060
You're feeding tubes and whatever. Um,
but the, they're never going to survive.

963
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:39,970
They feel no pain because
they have no brains.

964
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,620
So why aren't we testing pharmaceuticals
on them? Wow. Cause they're human.

965
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:48,550
That's some dark shit.
Well, it is. You're right.

966
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:52,960
But it makes sense. It certainly
makes sense. Logically, the emotional,

967
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,280
instead we're torturing, you
know, these living thinking,
you know, aware of beings.

968
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:01,230
Yeah. Um, the idea
being, of course, I mean,

969
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,110
the argument against that is
that if it saves one human being,

970
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:08,410
who cares about the champ?
That's, that's the, the idea wife.

971
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,510
If your wife has saved your,

972
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,700
the person you love more than anyone
else in this world is saved because they

973
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,360
tortured some chimp. It's not a
beautiful thing. You know, it's, it's,

974
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:21,570
it's very dark. But you'd be happy
that that chimp gave up his life.

975
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,190
Right? But I think that's
why have government's right

976
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:29,050
to think beyond that personal level.
Cause you know, that's what war is, right?

977
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:33,280
Where is innocent people are dying
so that, you know, and, and you know,

978
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:35,620
there is no good choice,
right? It's like, okay,

979
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:40,120
a thousand innocent people die there, or
100,000 innocent people die here. Well,

980
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:44,560
a government exists to kill those
thousand innocent people essentially.

981
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:45,461
Isn't that the real problem?

982
00:56:45,461 --> 00:56:48,760
Like what makes someone uniquely qualified
to be the person that makes it very

983
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:53,380
difficult choice and really no one
deserves to be the person who decides this

984
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:54,760
great group of people dies.

985
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,520
So this group of people lives or that
this lunch he gets, uh, you know, uh,

986
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,470
battery cable attached to his Dick,
right?

987
00:57:01,471 --> 00:57:05,350
That's why psychopaths do so well
because they're not worried about the

988
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:08,950
consequences there. They're able to
make those decisions or sociopaths.

989
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,890
I've never really understood
the difference between the two,

990
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:12,760
to be honest with you.

991
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,120
I think sociopaths don't feel empathy
and psychopaths like are prone to more

992
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:19,060
violent behavior,
if that makes any sense.

993
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,060
Like I think sociopaths from
what has been explained to me,

994
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:24,880
and I might be butchering this,
probably should look, but uh,

995
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:28,150
I think that the idea being that
they're not seeing feeling empathy,

996
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,980
like the rest of us are,
like if they,

997
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:34,000
by their actions they get ahead with Sony
else suffers, it doesn't bother them.

998
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,040
Whereas for you, you would do something
that would hurt someone's feelings.

999
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,790
You'd be like, man, I just
can't fucking sleeves. It's
so freaking me out. You know,

1000
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:42,550
they don't have that,
that sense of empathy.

1001
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:46,420
I have a friend who wrote a book called
the psychopath test. Oh, I read that.

1002
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,290
You Know Jon Ronson? Yeah, yeah. I
started reading it, I should say.

1003
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:55,210
I think I bailed on it. I got bored. Yeah.
Well you get the idea pretty quickly.

1004
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,730
I'm all add on that shit
like that, man. I can,

1005
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,130
I'm really good with like a
documentary and stuff like that,

1006
00:58:00,131 --> 00:58:04,550
but like getting deep into the dry
issues of psychopaths and sociopaths and

1007
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:09,100
what's his take on it? Uh, you
know, essentially that, uh,

1008
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:14,130
psychopaths are very prominent
in fields like Wall Street,

1009
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,270
military, you know, high.

1010
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:23,520
They do really well in areas where you
have to make decisions that you know,

1011
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,420
hurt people and you don't give a shit.

1012
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:30,220
Here's an article in psychology today
that explains it in a way many forensic

1013
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,001
psychologists,

1014
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:35,030
psychiatrist and criminologists use
the terms sociopathy and psychopathy

1015
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:35,883
interchangeably.

1016
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,420
A leading experts disagree on whether
there are meaningful differences between

1017
00:58:40,421 --> 00:58:41,980
the two conditions.
Uh,

1018
00:58:41,981 --> 00:58:46,870
I contend that there are
clear and significant
distinctions. [inaudible] okay.

1019
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:49,720
Sociopath and psychopaths share.
This is what they share.

1020
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:53,650
A disregard for the laws and social norms,
a disregard for the rights of others,

1021
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:58,180
a failure to feel remorse or guilt,
a tendency to display violent behavior.

1022
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,210
Uh,
in addition to their commonality.

1023
00:59:00,211 --> 00:59:04,180
Sociopaths and psychopaths also have their
own unique behavioral characteristics

1024
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:07,990
as well. Sociopaths tend to be
nervous and easily agitated.

1025
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:12,560
They are volatile and prone to emotional
outbursts including fits of rage, blah,

1026
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,340
blah, blah. Psychopaths.
Psychopaths on the other hand,

1027
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:19,090
are unable to form emotional attachments
or feel real empathy with others,

1028
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,400
although they often have,
or even charming

1029
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,580
personalities. Interesting. That's
what I would think of as sociopaths.

1030
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:29,330
Psychopaths are very manipulative
and can easily gain people's trust.

1031
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
They learned to mimic emotions.
Now I've met,

1032
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:35,660
I've met people that do that despite
their inability to actually feel them and

1033
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:39,050
will appeal normal to unsuspecting
people. I, I've seen that.

1034
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:42,320
I've seen that where I've
had conversations with
people and I realized that

1035
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:45,380
they're like mimicking emotions like,
oh yeah man,

1036
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,580
it's horrible that that happened to him.

1037
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:50,600
Like you don't care at all when you're
feeling like, no, you know there's a,

1038
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:55,410
there's like certain feelings that
people have what you feel you, you, you,

1039
00:59:55,411 --> 01:00:00,380
you see it in them that they feel remorse
or they feel sad or they feel empathy.

1040
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,290
And then there's other people that are
like fake in that where it's like they're

1041
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:06,110
doing a bad acting on a soap bar in La.
Dude.

1042
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,590
And I was on a TV show here
two weeks ago or something.

1043
01:00:09,591 --> 01:00:14,090
And it struck me how this sort of their
concentric circles of bullshit that get

1044
01:00:14,091 --> 01:00:17,320
more intense. The closer you
get to the cameras, you know,

1045
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:20,680
just like you check into the hotel
and they're like, hey Dr. Ryan,

1046
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,160
kind of light but friendly, but
they don't give a fuck. Right.

1047
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:28,640
And then you've got the driver who's
like, hey Yo, yeah, is everything good?

1048
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:30,530
Can I help you with that sir?
You know,

1049
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:34,310
then you get the assistant producer
who greets you at the door. Oh,

1050
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:38,030
we're so thrilled you're here,
Dr. Ryan. Uh, you know, it's just,

1051
01:00:38,031 --> 01:00:43,031
and then you're actually on stage in
front of the cameras and the shit is just

1052
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:48,020
like up to your fucking neck.
It's unbelievable. Yeah.
Like all the fake emotions.

1053
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:52,600
What kind of a show was it? Well, I'm
legally, uh, can't talk about it. No,

1054
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:57,320
I can't name it, but it was like
a, like a talk show, you know,

1055
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:01,250
kind of like where I was talking about
monogamy and you know, hey, you know,

1056
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:05,300
and the, the, like the
segment before me went long.

1057
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:09,180
It was about dirty underwear and you know,
so I'm like,

1058
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:14,120
that's important too. That's important to
discuss their issues. Is there bacteria?

1059
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:17,510
Can people die? What about vaccinations?
They protect you against dirty underwear.

1060
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,300
And I'm not saying it's a PR. I
don't, I've never seen the show,

1061
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:22,520
so I don't know if it's a good
show or a bad show, but it's just,

1062
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:26,750
I've experienced this in lots of
shows, not this show. All right,

1063
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:30,590
but lots of shows where
like your TV particularly,

1064
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,070
why am I talking to you about TV?
But in my experience,

1065
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:38,810
at least the way I interact with TV,
it's just such bullshit.

1066
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,120
Yeah, it can be. Certainly can be,

1067
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,250
but there's some shows that
you do that aren't bullshit.

1068
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,880
Like they're like the Jimmy Kimmel show.
For instance, you talked to Jimmy Kimmel,

1069
01:01:46,881 --> 01:01:50,810
he's like totally there. He seems like a
real guy. He's a real guy. He's totally,

1070
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:52,040
why I often wonder about,

1071
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,220
I was talking to his buddy that
doing the dolphin stuff, his,

1072
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:00,250
he dated a woman who was on a rebound
from George Clooney talking about a tough

1073
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:03,590
Gig, right? Like you're the
rebound from George Clooney.

1074
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:07,890
I would take that over the rock.
I'll take George Clooney all day.

1075
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,210
I Day Day,
I dated a woman who,

1076
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:14,840
who told me I was even
better than Fabio in bed. Uh,

1077
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:19,380
you should never know that a chick.
Fuck Fabio. Fabio, sloppy seconds.

1078
01:02:19,381 --> 01:02:20,214
Good Lord.

1079
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:25,230
Good Lord. She didn't tell me until it
was too late to sort of change course,

1080
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:29,570
but it's one of the most
dubious compliments I've
ever received. Interesting.

1081
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,240
Even better than Fabio.

1082
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,320
So Jimmy Kimmel was dating a girl who was
on the rebound from George [inaudible],

1083
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:39,780
not to him. He came home,
my buddy. But anyway,

1084
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:44,900
that got us talking about about famous
people who seem cool like George Clooney.

1085
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:47,910
To me, George Committee seems
like if you hung out with him,

1086
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:52,670
he would actually be a cool guy. Yeah. I
would imagine he'd be pretty cool. Yeah.

1087
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:56,450
And so like how hard is that a,

1088
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:01,410
for a guy like that who's probably a
thousand times more famous than like my

1089
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:02,244
level of fame,

1090
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,670
he's probably like legitimately like
a thousand times more famous than me.

1091
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,140
That's pretty intense fame. He can't go
anywhere. When George Clooney shows up,

1092
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,590
like helicopters will start circling the
restaurant that he's at and people just

1093
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:16,380
jump out of buses with cameras
and tried to touch him.

1094
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:20,850
And it relates to what we
were just talking about.
Like that fake emotion thing.

1095
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,500
Right. How much true input is
he getting from human beings?

1096
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:28,350
Well he goes to other countries. That's
one of the things that I think benefits.

1097
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:32,550
You forgot like that. I think he's got
like a fucking villa in France, France.

1098
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:36,990
Notice how I said France because
I didn't say France.

1099
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:42,120
Okay. I'm not like that. He uh, he's
got, he's got mad cash. That's cool.

1100
01:03:42,121 --> 01:03:44,700
Cause it insulates them from a
lot of the bullshit, but yeah,

1101
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:47,220
but it also attracts the
bullshit. Well, I was gonna say,

1102
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:51,500
my buddy is friends with
Johnny Depp and his,

1103
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:57,120
and he spent some time with Johnny Depp
in England and he said it was the most

1104
01:03:57,121 --> 01:03:58,980
ridiculous scene you've
ever seen in your life.

1105
01:03:58,981 --> 01:04:00,810
The guy can't go anywhere
everywhere he goes.

1106
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:04,590
There's people with earpieces in and
suits and they follow him everywhere.

1107
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,020
They're like their peripheral
and you tried to go outside.

1108
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:09,860
He was like going outside to have
a cigarette and they swarm on,

1109
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,560
get your ride somewhere. Do you need
something? Like you're always cater to.

1110
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,020
And so he lives in this
weird insulated world.

1111
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:19,560
We like runs from restaurant to restaurant
and had chefs come over his house and

1112
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:23,430
cook. You can't go to their
stores everywhere he goes.
He's being swarmed upon.

1113
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:26,830
And for him, apparently it happened, uh,

1114
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:30,600
after the pirates of the Caribbean movie
sound like took things to this critical

1115
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:34,500
nuclear place where it's at right now
where he's just like, he's a story.

1116
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,230
He's an an object of
attention everywhere he goes.

1117
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:39,960
There's got to be really hard to keep
your shit together when you're like that,

1118
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,220
because your version of
reality. So fuck. Yeah. I mean,

1119
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,190
you're not getting the sort of,
the feedback that you need just to like,

1120
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:50,610
know what's real. You know, it's,

1121
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,990
it's interesting the character
that put him over, you know,

1122
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:59,991
into that world of strangeness
was based on a Keith Richards,

1123
01:05:00,121 --> 01:05:04,530
right? Yeah. Who I, yesterday I was
talking to my friend towel who, um,

1124
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:08,430
he's an Italian prince talking
about European, you know,

1125
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,780
he was married to Olivia Wilde for seven
years, you know, so he sort of like,

1126
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:17,130
he's like in this world,
a strange world. And uh,

1127
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:18,340
he was talking,

1128
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:23,340
his father was this crazy Italian prince
who hung out with Fellini and Brigitte

1129
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:28,180
Bardot and Salvador Dali and he sort of
started the dolce Vita in Italy and the

1130
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:33,181
50s and squander this huge family fortune
you like in his lifetime on women and

1131
01:05:34,961 --> 01:05:38,410
boats and parties and all that
shit. You know, I love him. Yeah,

1132
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:40,690
really interesting cat.
Anyway,

1133
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:44,980
Tau is a great a Flamenco guitarist.
And we were talking about like,

1134
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:47,770
how do you get into, you know, how, when
did you start playing guitar? And he said,

1135
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:50,770
well, when I was 13, um,

1136
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,820
the rolling stones came to like
Rome or wherever they were playing.

1137
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:59,821
And my dad is an old friend of Keith
Richards and he took me to the hotel where

1138
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:04,990
the stones were standing and Keith had
like a whole floor to himself, right.

1139
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,470
And we went in and there are all these
people and all this scene and actually

1140
01:06:08,471 --> 01:06:12,070
Keith Richard's father was there,
he mentioned and um,

1141
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:16,390
and my dad had mentioned to Keith
like, Hey, towels, learning guitar.

1142
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:22,140
And Keith had a Flamenco guitar there
and he picked it up and he did a few like

1143
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,580
riffs and he said to him,
if you want to learn to play guitar,

1144
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,280
learn Flamenco because if you can
play Flamenco you can play anything.

1145
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:35,320
And towel now is a fucking great
flamenco guitarist. And he was like, man,

1146
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:39,550
if Keith Richards, I tells you
what to do. Like, you know,

1147
01:06:39,551 --> 01:06:42,610
that's what you do, you know, and
he fucking went with it. It's great.

1148
01:06:42,611 --> 01:06:43,151
That makes sense.

1149
01:06:43,151 --> 01:06:46,360
Cause that Flamenco is very fast finger
movements to be like you would have to

1150
01:06:46,361 --> 01:06:49,060
develop some incredible
coordination or your fingers. Yeah.

1151
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:53,590
Like doing a stone's riff
after that. Yeah. It's a,

1152
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:58,420
I've always loved music but have
never had any inclination to learn an

1153
01:06:58,421 --> 01:07:01,930
instrument. Yeah, I love it.
Do you regret that? Nope.

1154
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,210
There's not enough time.
You know,

1155
01:07:04,211 --> 01:07:08,230
I mean I have enough forms of
expression that I'm, I'm enjoying.

1156
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,140
I think it would be cool as fuck, man.
Yeah. You watch like Jimi Hendrix Solo,

1157
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,190
you know? Good Lord. Can you
imagine if you could just,

1158
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:19,870
just the feeling of being in it that
deeply the flow, you know, it's just,

1159
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:23,170
that's what I regret. You know,
I never had the discipline.

1160
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:27,250
I took electric guitar lessons for two
weeks and quit and I took piano for a

1161
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:30,340
week and quit and you know, I was
just too much of a fuck off as a kid.

1162
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:35,590
I could never get over the hump to where
it started being enjoyable and the need

1163
01:07:35,591 --> 01:07:38,830
to be obsessed to get
really good at anything.

1164
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:42,580
Whether it's the drums or
the guitar playing chess.

1165
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:43,900
I mean it's all the same thing really.

1166
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:47,700
It's like you need to just get obsessed
at that particular discipline, you know,

1167
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:50,590
whatever it is that it takes
to get really good at it.

1168
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,470
A big part of what makes
someone really good at anything.

1169
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:56,230
It's like this crazy obsession.
If you don't have that obsession,

1170
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:59,350
you'll just drift in and out from one
thing to the other until you find the

1171
01:07:59,351 --> 01:08:00,820
thing that you really are obsessed with.

1172
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:05,920
Do you think the now obsession is defined,
you know,

1173
01:08:05,921 --> 01:08:10,420
in the psychological terms as a pathology,
right.

1174
01:08:10,421 --> 01:08:13,930
Obsessive compulsive disorder and,
and you know,

1175
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:16,010
this is a very kind of thought,
but

1176
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:21,010
it's like in our society and this relates
back to the psychopaths who attained

1177
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:23,660
great success are,

1178
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,440
I mean our most really successful people,
uh,

1179
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:32,210
responding to some deep trauma, you know
what I mean? Like they say Comedians,

1180
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:36,860
you know, there's some need for approval
and you know, make people laugh,

1181
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:40,820
make people love you, you know,
because whatever your family structure,

1182
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:43,760
I don't know as many comedians as you do,
but you know,

1183
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:46,880
you always hear that right?
You don't very, you know,
cause I needed the attention.

1184
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:51,410
I in an actor's like they need people
looking at them. They need to be on stage.

1185
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:54,950
They're like drinking that
up because there's some need.

1186
01:08:54,951 --> 01:08:59,750
It nourishes them on some level.
So I wonder like is there,

1187
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,260
you know,

1188
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,530
like I'm thinking about people who say
like I learned to play guitar so I could

1189
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:05,510
get laid, you know, cause the girls were,

1190
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:09,290
I guess I didn't if I didn't think of it.

1191
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:14,870
So like if you had told me I would get
like maybe if you and your friends got

1192
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:17,270
together and you were like, man, we're
having a hard time getting late. Okay,

1193
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:20,180
here's the form of that
and let's make a band

1194
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:23,860
thank you. Probably wouldn't be as
good as if you guys were like, man,

1195
01:09:23,861 --> 01:09:26,740
Q man look to stones where our
age when they got together,

1196
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:28,210
let's just fucking do this guys.
You know,

1197
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:33,080
if you like really had this desire to
produce something that people love and

1198
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,870
that's where you kind of have to do.
You have to,

1199
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,740
I think to get to be a Keith Richards,
you have the,

1200
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:41,740
you have to have this desire to produce
something that people are going to love.

1201
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:46,720
Because like when you listen to his
guitar rifts in or any great guitar,

1202
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:48,010
Stevie Rayvon anyone,

1203
01:09:48,011 --> 01:09:53,011
I mean they have to have this deep desire
to connect with the just the correct

1204
01:09:53,441 --> 01:09:57,750
sounds that's coming out of their
mind, their imagination, their,

1205
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,540
their skill, their interpretation
of the moment. You know,

1206
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,190
like that's why people like,
like when someone does a guitar Solo,

1207
01:10:06,191 --> 01:10:08,860
the idea being that this guy
is just feeling it, you know,

1208
01:10:08,861 --> 01:10:13,450
it's not the exact same solo every
time. Every time they're doing it. Like,

1209
01:10:13,451 --> 01:10:13,811
you know,

1210
01:10:13,811 --> 01:10:17,020
if a guy just just starts riffing and
everybody starts cheering and going along

1211
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:21,010
with it, you want to see like, what's
what's in that guy right at that moment.

1212
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,970
It expresses itself through all the
discipline or all the years that he's

1213
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:29,470
practice guitar and then
the finger coordination that
it's able to achieve. And,

1214
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,890
and you know, you, there's
some shit that's like, you
could tell that just kind of,

1215
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:37,600
they're just going fast. Right.
You know, there's going fast. Yeah.

1216
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:40,420
Just people that shred and it's really
cool and it's really impressive.

1217
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:43,870
And then there's like some
Stevie Ray Vaughan Shit.

1218
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:48,220
There's some Stevie Ray Vaughan where
you like feel like him crying through the

1219
01:10:48,221 --> 01:10:49,900
guitar.
Like there's like,

1220
01:10:49,901 --> 01:10:54,040
there's like this whole emotion that's
attached to it and then people connect to

1221
01:10:54,370 --> 01:10:58,570
and when you see like Stevie or Yvonne's
version of little wing. Yeah. You know,

1222
01:10:58,571 --> 01:11:03,571
you see a great guitarist inhabiting
and loving another great guitars.

1223
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,090
You know, there's something
really beautiful about that.

1224
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,810
Yeah, Dude. Fuck yeah. He's,

1225
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,130
his version of Voodoo child is the only
version I accept other than Hendrickson.

1226
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,960
Right. Obviously I'm a
huge Hendrix fan. Yeah.

1227
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:18,960
I mean that's why I named this the Joe
Rogan experience to rebuff had a really

1228
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:22,680
cute always from the time I
was little kid. I mean he just,

1229
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:25,380
he has a special quality to him.

1230
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:30,680
Like that Song Voodoo child to me
like that just brown box sitting.

1231
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:35,520
Yeah. Where the fuck did that
come? Who did that before him?

1232
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:40,800
I mean compare music before Hendrix
and after Hendrix. It's like,

1233
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:43,230
I really believe that like,
especially Voodoo child,

1234
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:47,100
there's something about that beginning
riff Parallon like when he really gets

1235
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:50,220
into it, it's like God,
he was on some new place.

1236
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,620
It was in some new dimension when he was

1237
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,990
and when you string the
guitar like fuck that.

1238
01:11:54,991 --> 01:11:57,270
I'm not learning that I'm doing it my way.
That's it.

1239
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:02,300
He's just like so unconcerned
with what came before in a way,

1240
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:05,170
you know drunk. Yeah. He
was on drugs. Well that,

1241
01:12:05,171 --> 01:12:09,270
that's what I was going to
say and honestly the first
time it's special drugs,

1242
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:13,100
not coke. Oh yeah. Right now he's
on all sorts of general. Yeah,

1243
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,080
I mean I there,
there it is.

1244
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:19,990
Hit, hit that, crank that
shit up. Listen to this.

1245
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:24,840
Well you really have to think about it.

1246
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:29,120
This is the late 1960s when
this guy comes out with this.

1247
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:34,330
Now if you just go 10 years before that
you're dealing with like buddy Holly and

1248
01:12:34,790 --> 01:12:39,790
which is great music but this is just
some next level shit like listen to this

1249
01:12:41,721 --> 01:12:42,554
part.

1250
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:47,420
This is one dude by the
way and the distortion.

1251
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,850
That's my,
I have a few all time favorite song.

1252
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:56,980
I don't have like a all time favorite
song but I listened to that motherfucker

1253
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:58,910
when I'm in my car on the way to the gym.

1254
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:03,050
I'll time it for like the last five
minutes before I get to the gym is Voodoo

1255
01:13:03,051 --> 01:13:07,700
child cause it's just just fucking blast.
Hey put my phone on airplane mode.

1256
01:13:07,701 --> 01:13:12,701
Fuck you and hear this
cranked always high.

1257
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:17,360
That's just,
it just touches like your DNA.

1258
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:21,530
You feel that guy's expression
right through the sound. I

1259
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,730
get that with the dealer. Listen to Danny
California, the red hot chili peppers.

1260
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,670
Is it? Oh yeah. Okay.
Yeah, there's like a tar.

1261
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:33,540
There's a thing like the whole song builds
to this fucking wild guitar lead and

1262
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:36,530
near the end and like if I'm
working out or running or something.

1263
01:13:36,531 --> 01:13:38,720
I always have that on my
playlist because I just,

1264
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:43,430
there's like energy comes out of the
ether, you know? It's amazing. Yeah.

1265
01:13:43,431 --> 01:13:45,290
They had a cover of higher ground.

1266
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:50,570
That was one of the few covers that I
actually enjoy it as much as the original,

1267
01:13:50,571 --> 01:13:53,630
just like Stevie Ray Vaughan,
his version of Voodoo child.

1268
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:57,650
There's some covers that are better.
I that I really love that genre of music.

1269
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:02,210
You know where a cover like gets the
essence of the song in a way that the

1270
01:14:02,211 --> 01:14:07,160
original performer may have missed.
Like there are a few, the few examples,

1271
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,620
I mean all along the watchtower,
you know,

1272
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,770
I think Hendrick's that better than Dylan.

1273
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:15,670
Dylan and Dylan actually said that as
well. Yeah. It's just so different.

1274
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,450
His version of it,

1275
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:20,440
different song. I mean it's just
so, it's so different and you know,

1276
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:24,300
here's one that people don't
talk. Suspicious minds.
Dwight Yoakam did a cover.

1277
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:24,470
Yeah,

1278
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:28,730
suspicious. Fine. Right? It's better
than Elvis. People get mad. Fine.

1279
01:14:28,731 --> 01:14:33,020
Young cannibals. That's fine. Young
cannibals did a version of it,

1280
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,500
which isn't bad. Yeah, he did a
great version two. It's a funny song.

1281
01:14:36,501 --> 01:14:40,940
Suspicious minds cause bay. It's
Elvis saying, oh come on baby.

1282
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:45,590
You know, I wouldn't lie to you. You get
to believe, but here your lying eyes,

1283
01:14:45,591 --> 01:14:50,360
especially in the context of
Elvis's guys. Dude, come on baby.

1284
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:55,070
It's like JFK saying, Hey, I'm a one woman
man. Yeah, sure. You are not only that,

1285
01:14:55,071 --> 01:14:56,450
Elvis was probably on so many pills.

1286
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:58,680
He didn't know if he was
monogamous when he was,

1287
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:03,110
the drugs are drifting in and out of
consciousness all day long. I mean,

1288
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:07,110
he was a guy talking about trauma
leading to great fame, right? Yeah,

1289
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:12,230
yeah. Damaged soul, you know, seeking

1290
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,310
approval from the world.
Why?

1291
01:15:14,311 --> 01:15:19,311
I often wonder if what we're seeing
when we see great like great resonating

1292
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:24,630
forms of expression, whether it's art
or whether it's a comedy or you know,

1293
01:15:24,631 --> 01:15:25,750
any music.

1294
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,490
I always wonder if what we're looking
at is a mathematical equation.

1295
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:35,440
If we're looking at like a yin and a Yang,
an ebb and a pole and that the Arab,

1296
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:40,150
you know, whatever it was that created
this great deficit responds the body,

1297
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:41,200
the mind,
the soul,

1298
01:15:41,201 --> 01:15:45,040
the spirit responds with this incredible
work of art to sort of make up for all

1299
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:49,550
the trauma that had experienced
when it was young. Which is why it,

1300
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:50,380
it's,

1301
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:55,380
it's really tough to find someone who
had this really ultra privileged life who

1302
01:15:55,821 --> 01:15:59,230
was accepted and loved and nurtured
and every way who becomes this really

1303
01:15:59,231 --> 01:16:00,940
fascinating, great artist, right? Like,

1304
01:16:00,941 --> 01:16:05,890
what you usually find is these people
that are in pain and torn up and yeah,

1305
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:06,400
and I,

1306
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:11,370
I often wonder if we're looking at it in
a cultural context and we sort of like,

1307
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,940
oh,
that guy's an asshole,

1308
01:16:12,941 --> 01:16:17,890
or his life sucked or she was abused
or he was neglected. And we're,

1309
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,890
we're, we're looking at it
in terms of like these, um,

1310
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:25,360
these definitions that we've already
categorized in our mind, but in fact,

1311
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:29,410
what it really is, is like math
is that with all evens out? Yeah.

1312
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:33,060
We're looking at a minus and a positive.
We're looking at a Jimmy Hendricks,

1313
01:16:33,061 --> 01:16:38,061
this young black man in this incredibly
racist world and comes along like right

1314
01:16:38,381 --> 01:16:42,910
at the moment of this psychedelic
acceptance where the whole world,

1315
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:46,510
especially young people are turning on
in a way that they never had before.

1316
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:49,960
The Beatles come along, they do the
white album, people are freaking out,

1317
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,080
clapped in pink, you
know, Layla, pink Floyd.

1318
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:56,560
And then all of a sudden this dude
comes along who's dressed like a fucking

1319
01:16:56,561 --> 01:16:59,890
Indian. He's got a headband on and
he's playing music from outer space.

1320
01:16:59,891 --> 01:17:03,990
Chewing gum. Yeah. I mean, totally.
You know, Phil Hartman, uh,

1321
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
rest his soul who's a good friend
from dues radio and he was uh,

1322
01:17:09,770 --> 01:17:13,220
he grew up, um, when he
was young rather, uh,

1323
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:17,480
he lived in Hollywood and he worked
as like a stage hand when Jimi Hendrix

1324
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:18,314
played the whiskey.

1325
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:23,720
And so he was right there with Jimmy
Hendrix holding the speaker because

1326
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,840
sometimes the speakers
would fall off the stage,

1327
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,110
like they were on the edge of the
stage and you had to be there in case

1328
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:34,430
something happened. So he was there
when Hendrix first burst on the scene.

1329
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,060
So here's the close to Hendrickson's. You
already right in front row seat, right?

1330
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,750
Played Guitar.
I'm Phil was a plagues on everything.

1331
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:43,490
He was a true genius.

1332
01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:46,520
I mean he really could do anything and
he had an incredible work ethic that guy,

1333
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,410
like we joke around about it.

1334
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:51,080
We had this thing we did at
the Hollywood walk of fame.

1335
01:17:51,081 --> 01:17:55,680
He got a star earlier this year and
Stephen Root and candy Alexander and I or

1336
01:17:55,681 --> 01:17:59,810
were joking around about how Phil
had these notes like he would have,

1337
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,340
his script would be,

1338
01:18:01,341 --> 01:18:05,490
he would have tabs for each scene and
they were like these different colored

1339
01:18:05,491 --> 01:18:08,780
tabs for every scene that he was in and
everything would be highlighted and he

1340
01:18:08,781 --> 01:18:12,110
would have notes and stick hymns and
everything was like super organized and we

1341
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:14,390
were always like, [inaudible]
your script. You know,

1342
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,960
like nobody can find the fucking script.
But Phil had his shit in a binder.

1343
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:20,990
He would take his thing, he would punch
holes in them, stick them in a binder,

1344
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:25,880
you know, he was super duper organized
and anal about that kind of shit.

1345
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:30,050
But one of his greatest moments,
you know, when we were friends,

1346
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:31,850
somewhere along the line,

1347
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:35,390
he started smoking weed like all the
time it was before I actually smoked weed

1348
01:18:35,810 --> 01:18:39,860
and he did it because he had a lot of
problems. There's a lot of marital issues,

1349
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:41,690
obviously that led to
his wife killing him.

1350
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,980
But he enjoyed like after work was done,
not while I was there,

1351
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,990
but after work was done.
He enjoy getting high.

1352
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:51,170
He loved getting high and
then going on a boat and uh,

1353
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,130
he had a boat and he would take his boat
out and he would just love painting,

1354
01:18:54,150 --> 01:18:55,160
high sailing.

1355
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:59,900
And he was telling me one time we were
hanging out in his room. It was after,

1356
01:18:59,930 --> 01:19:04,580
after filming and he was high and he was
telling me that story about him working

1357
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:07,730
at this club and holding the speakers
for Hendricks. And to this day,

1358
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:11,500
it's like one of my favorite memories
of him, you know, because it's just,

1359
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:16,160
I could see him as this young guy. It's
like he was so fascinated by everything.

1360
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,070
He's the only guy that I've ever met
that I went to a strip club with and it

1361
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:23,390
didn't feel creepy cause
he, he sat down, he was, uh,

1362
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:26,600
he sat down. I can say this now because
he's dead. I couldn't, if he was alive,

1363
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:27,650
I would probably not tell you the story.

1364
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:32,360
But he still loved to go to this place
called Bob's classy lady and it was in

1365
01:19:32,361 --> 01:19:37,130
the valley. That's great. Phil
took me there. Um, and uh, he,

1366
01:19:37,131 --> 01:19:40,700
um, he would sit by the stage
and the girls who come out
and dance and you'd give

1367
01:19:40,701 --> 01:19:45,701
them money and he was like a genuine
childlike enthusiasm for their bodies.

1368
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:49,580
You know, there'd be like moving her front
and be like, wow, you're beautiful. Oh,

1369
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:52,970
you're Pitney was high as fuck.
Just high as fuck.

1370
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:57,620
And he was watching these girls dance
and stick their genitals in his face and

1371
01:19:57,621 --> 01:20:01,430
he just was loving it.
He was loving in a way that wasn't creepy.

1372
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,380
Like it was weird.

1373
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:08,381
It's like he had this almost
like innocence about the
way he was appreciating

1374
01:20:10,621 --> 01:20:14,220
their bodies that I didn't feel weird
being near him while this was happening

1375
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:18,180
because it was just me and him. Could you
feel it as well or we used to insecure.

1376
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:20,970
Yeah, I was too. Uh, for whatever reason,

1377
01:20:20,971 --> 01:20:25,230
I've just too many preset
ideas about bodies. And I,

1378
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:27,720
it also, I was like, at
the time I was singing,

1379
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:32,721
I was 26 or 27 maybe 28 at the most
and I was pretty fucking crazy.

1380
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:35,010
I was just a different person.

1381
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:40,200
I was still operating on the momentum
of my youth and in chaos and I couldn't

1382
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:42,960
even believe I was hanging out
with Phil Hartman at a strip club.

1383
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:47,310
Like to me like seven years before
that I had been fighting, you know,

1384
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:50,760
so it was like so recent.
It's like my competition days,

1385
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,790
so flavored like who I was.
Cause like you know,

1386
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:57,810
you're talking about the word obsessed.
What it means is a sickness.

1387
01:20:58,350 --> 01:21:01,080
The sickness meaning that you can get good
at something because of that sickness.

1388
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:03,540
I was a hundred percent sick
when I was a kid. I was sick.

1389
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:07,920
It's fuck psychotic in that way.
You know,

1390
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:10,350
not in a way where like I didn't
care about other people's feelings,

1391
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:13,950
but just ups. Maybe psychotics, not
the word. Now that we've researched it,

1392
01:21:13,980 --> 01:21:18,930
maybe it's the word is just,
just singular in my purpose and vision on,

1393
01:21:18,990 --> 01:21:23,370
on earth. I just wanted to do that.
And only that mono mania. Yeah.

1394
01:21:23,371 --> 01:21:27,120
And so it was hard for me to get out of
that headset for a long time. It was,

1395
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:29,340
I would to drift back into that headset.

1396
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:33,360
I don't try to fight it off and
try to like simulate and be normal,

1397
01:21:33,361 --> 01:21:36,420
but I'd felt like I like
almost like a drug addict too.

1398
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:39,300
It stopped doing coke or heroin
or math or something like that.

1399
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:42,960
I had like gone into this world where
there was no more fight or flight.

1400
01:21:42,990 --> 01:21:47,990
There was no more terrifying bouts of
competition followed by preparation,

1401
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:50,160
followed by more competition.

1402
01:21:50,370 --> 01:21:52,530
Now all of a sudden I'm hanging out
with Phil Hartman and Strip club.

1403
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,290
Did performance feel that way at all?
Like you know,

1404
01:21:55,291 --> 01:22:00,240
you got to taping on Friday leading up to
it. You sorta nervous you're preparing,

1405
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:03,570
you know, to some extent.
Definitely not a TV show. TV shows,

1406
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:07,620
especially news radio was one of the
easiest jobs I've ever had in my life in

1407
01:22:07,621 --> 01:22:11,130
terms of the actual performance of it. I
mean, you'd be a little nervous before,

1408
01:22:11,131 --> 01:22:13,080
make sure you knew your lines,
make sure you get it right.

1409
01:22:13,410 --> 01:22:18,000
But the cats was so fucking good that
like you were working with these people

1410
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:20,700
that were so funny.
All you had to do is just do your thing.

1411
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:25,560
Like if it was me and a scene with Andy
Dick, all I had to do was just go, Andy,

1412
01:22:25,561 --> 01:22:28,020
what are you talking about man?
What are you talking about?

1413
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:31,380
And then he would do his wackiness and
then I would do whatever I had to say.

1414
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:34,230
And the hard part was not laughing,
you know,

1415
01:22:34,260 --> 01:22:38,030
it was remembering your lines first and
then Rick, not laughing. That's amazing.

1416
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,020
But it'd be acting about stand up.

1417
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:44,340
That's a little different because you're
creating it, you know, and news radio,

1418
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:47,520
they allowed us a lot of room for ad
libbing. But even if you do create it,

1419
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:49,750
you're interacting with someone
else and it's, you know, you're,

1420
01:22:49,751 --> 01:22:53,100
you're pretending some things
are happening and either
works or doesn't work and

1421
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,980
it doesn't work. You get together and you
take a five minute break. The writers,

1422
01:22:55,981 --> 01:22:57,000
all wood,
you know,

1423
01:22:57,001 --> 01:23:00,270
Paul and Josh and all these guys would
all huddle together and we'd try to come

1424
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:01,650
up with another line.
You know,

1425
01:23:01,651 --> 01:23:04,290
so it's like everyone was
working together on this thing,

1426
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:08,470
so it was in a way easier than standup
because standup where alone you're on

1427
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:10,750
your own bitch. You know,
if you're out there bombing,

1428
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:14,610
especially p people paid money to
see it, it's fucking, you know, you,

1429
01:23:14,620 --> 01:23:18,820
you better come. Correct. You better have
some shit to say. So stand up more so,

1430
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:21,100
but still never as terrifying as the,

1431
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:25,690
the in between bouts between
competition. It was terrifying. You ever,

1432
01:23:25,691 --> 01:23:29,500
was there ever any sort of a possibility
of you being on Saturday night live?

1433
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:34,090
I never wanted to act at all. I
didn't, I didn't the sketch that, no,

1434
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:36,420
I don't want to do that.
So how, how did it happen?

1435
01:23:36,910 --> 01:23:40,030
I mean you don't have to talk about
if this is still cover the top.

1436
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:42,430
Definitely have. It's super simple.
I just got a development deal.

1437
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:44,800
It did MTV half hour comedy hour.
I got a development deal.

1438
01:23:44,801 --> 01:23:46,380
They offered me a lot of money fixing,
you know,

1439
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:50,140
I was on a Disney show of all things
for Fox. Two hilarious things.

1440
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,920
Disney show for Fox was called
hardball. Um, when that was over,

1441
01:23:53,921 --> 01:23:57,310
I was totally ready to quit show.
But boy, that was a character.

1442
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:01,240
I played a baseball player,
frank [inaudible] and I was terrible show.

1443
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:02,350
It started off really good.

1444
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:04,810
The guys who created it were
writers from the Simpsons,

1445
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:07,540
Jeff Martin and Kevin Curran.
They were writers from the Simpsons.

1446
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:10,120
They wrote from married with children
and they were brilliant, brilliant guys.

1447
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:14,400
But they were soft spoken, you know,
writers, intellectuals got steamrolled,

1448
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,820
got steamrolled,
they got steamrolled by half

1449
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,200
the people who came in,
you know,

1450
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,360
Fox didn't think there were
strong enough to run a show.

1451
01:24:22,361 --> 01:24:26,380
So they fucked up their pilot. They
fucked up all, all the episodes and they,

1452
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:28,950
they tanked a great
idea. You know, they, uh,

1453
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:33,070
they were baseball fans and they
wanted to make a hilarious Sitcom about

1454
01:24:33,071 --> 01:24:37,780
baseball, akin to married
with children for baseball.
Right. That was her idea. And,

1455
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:41,950
um, I hated it. I hated, I
didn't hate them and I loved,

1456
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:45,680
I loved being in the pilot. Jim Breuer
was actually in the pilot with me. Um,

1457
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:49,450
Jim played a,
it was a onetime role for him and um,

1458
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:54,490
it was just a bad scene. It was just not
fun. I didn't enjoy working with actors.

1459
01:24:54,491 --> 01:24:56,680
I thought some of them became friends,

1460
01:24:56,980 --> 01:25:00,720
but a bunch of them were like unbelievably
self centered and weird and just,

1461
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:05,050
you got no training, you never did
theater and zero, no desire either,

1462
01:25:05,051 --> 01:25:08,260
which is infuriating to them.
But all of a sudden I was in their turf.

1463
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:14,020
Who is this guy? And I played
the baseball star. I was the,

1464
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:18,430
the guy who was the star of the team.
So it was based on your comedy? No,

1465
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:21,400
not at all. Oh, the, the
MTV thing was in a, no,

1466
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:26,770
my comedy like got me to the MTV thing,
but the Sitcom,

1467
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:31,180
they had already written it. I just, they
just cast me. I met them and they said,

1468
01:25:31,181 --> 01:25:34,180
you could be that guy. And so boom, all
of a sudden I'm in Hollywood and um,

1469
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,690
they're putting makeup on me. I'm was
like, when you moved out of Christ, um,

1470
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,840
I did the pilot first. Uh,
so I came out here to visit.

1471
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:43,180
I got one of those Oakwood
apartments. Right. You know,

1472
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:47,920
on in Burbank that everybody automatically
goes to if they have these rented

1473
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:50,170
furnished apartments and the cable.
It's beautiful.

1474
01:25:50,171 --> 01:25:53,830
He just moved right in sleeping some
bad that some dude before he's been fart

1475
01:25:53,831 --> 01:25:58,690
and jerking off and, and
um, I did that and then um,

1476
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:00,910
then it became, it got picked
up. Then I got an apartment.

1477
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,860
I signed a lease cause I figured
out this is going to stay.

1478
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,860
I had the Oakwood for like
a couple of weeks. I'm like,

1479
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,440
oh this show is doing well and they
thought it was going to get picked up and

1480
01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:12,470
then it got cancelled. So then,
uh, I got news radio, same thing.

1481
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,000
It's just a audition.

1482
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:17,660
Went in for an audition as a cattle
call was like a hundred dudes. Yeah,

1483
01:26:17,661 --> 01:26:21,530
I met them, went in, did an audition,
came back, did a second audition, Bam.

1484
01:26:21,531 --> 01:26:24,140
I'm on a show. We did some amazing
sitting there at the table.

1485
01:26:24,141 --> 01:26:28,400
Read with Phil Hartman, Dave Foley.
So all told being on news radio,

1486
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:32,900
I had even thought about ever
acting for less than a year. And I,

1487
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:36,020
this is all my second TV show. That's
fucking insane. It's totally insane.

1488
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:38,090
And the second show I ever
auditioned for it, by the way,

1489
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,820
I only auditioned for two shows
ever and I was on both of them.

1490
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:44,990
It didn't make any sense.
And so you know too,

1491
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:49,310
what do you attribute this lucky as
fuck that for sure. Lucky as fuck.

1492
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,080
And the ability to perform under pressure.

1493
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:54,350
That's one of the things about sitcoms,
about auditioning for them.

1494
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:58,310
It's so unnatural. You're in
this room, there's a table,

1495
01:26:58,370 --> 01:27:01,520
there's these people that you don't know
and you're supposed to pretend that you

1496
01:27:01,521 --> 01:27:04,910
know, we're on a tropical island and we're
trying to find where the first aid cap

1497
01:27:05,060 --> 01:27:09,890
cabin is. You know, it's fake like in
a lot of times people like, oh my God,

1498
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,480
my life depends on this.
My bills.

1499
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:14,990
And some people have never had
to perform under pressure before.

1500
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,050
But being a standup helps that
tremendously cause you're,

1501
01:27:18,051 --> 01:27:19,370
you're accustomed to being nervous.

1502
01:27:19,550 --> 01:27:22,370
And then fighting helps that tremendously
because you're accustomed to being

1503
01:27:22,371 --> 01:27:25,470
nervous. So those two
things, you know, I, I,

1504
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:29,450
I performed under pressure more than
the average person even though I didn't

1505
01:27:29,451 --> 01:27:32,300
have a lot of acting experience.
Interesting.

1506
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,340
That's very interesting way
to look at it. Yeah. I just,

1507
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:36,770
I mean I'm interested in all of this.

1508
01:27:36,771 --> 01:27:40,940
I just watched that SNL special the
other night. Yeah. Lot of Phil Hartman,

1509
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,970
he was amazing and a lot
of audition tapes as well.

1510
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,850
He's one of the reasons why I
never wanted to do it though. His,

1511
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:51,080
his depiction of working in
siren live was not good. No,

1512
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,150
a lot of people hated it. He hated
it. Well Phil is a nice fucking guy.

1513
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:59,410
Was a nice fucking guy. He was
not so sharp. Nice. It's uh,

1514
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:02,840
it's a very ultra competitive,
mean spirited place.

1515
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:07,070
And Phil had the remanence of that
almost like as a defensive shell when he

1516
01:28:07,071 --> 01:28:08,720
first started working on news radio.

1517
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:12,380
Like you would say like things that
like were really uncharacteristic of him

1518
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:15,590
later and it was really any,
we actually talked about it and he,

1519
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:16,580
I don't want to name any names,

1520
01:28:16,581 --> 01:28:20,650
but he was talking about some mean people
that he worked with on the show. No,

1521
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:23,360
I don't believe he's got that reputation.

1522
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:26,710
Does a lot of people that come from
that environment do because I think it's

1523
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,900
really hostile and they're all competing
to get their stuff in the air and

1524
01:28:29,901 --> 01:28:31,430
there's a lot of backstabbing,
you know,

1525
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:34,520
there's people like doing favors for
writers and trying to get their stuff in

1526
01:28:34,521 --> 01:28:38,330
and there's a lot of, there's
a lot of greatness that
comes from that too. I mean,

1527
01:28:38,331 --> 01:28:39,350
we just siren live.

1528
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,850
If you look at the overall body of work
and you just cherry pick greatness,

1529
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:44,511
my God,

1530
01:28:44,511 --> 01:28:48,890
I mean you have this incredible bouquet
of John Belushi and Phil Hartman and

1531
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:51,370
Adam Sandler and Chris rock.
I mean you,

1532
01:28:51,371 --> 01:28:55,580
I was greatness Eddie motherfucking
Murphy, who was genius on that show.

1533
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,740
Him playing buckwheat. My God.
I mean it was amazing. It was a,

1534
01:29:00,741 --> 01:29:01,710
it was a,
but

1535
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:04,680
I never had a desire to do that. I don't
want to compete with a bunch of people.

1536
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:07,560
Like I don't want to be in a
hostile and vine, believe it or not.

1537
01:29:07,561 --> 01:29:10,380
And it doesn't make sense because
I did martial arts my whole life.

1538
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:13,590
I was trying to avoid hostility. Like
I don't want to, I don't want to argue.

1539
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:15,840
I don't want any conflict.
I don't want to compete.

1540
01:29:16,010 --> 01:29:19,560
Like the beautiful thing about standup
comedy is you're creating it yourself.

1541
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,240
You go up there, you do
it, you're the right.

1542
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,490
You don't have to argue with people
about it. If they don't like it,

1543
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:24,750
they're not going to laugh
and then you're fucked.

1544
01:29:24,751 --> 01:29:26,850
You got to restructure it
and figure it out yourself.

1545
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:28,740
You know how I feel about writing books?

1546
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:33,720
I mean sometimes I miss like an idealized
team kind of environment because I

1547
01:29:33,721 --> 01:29:35,310
know how wonderful that can be.

1548
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,270
But the reality is that generally
when you work with people,

1549
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:43,800
you don't necessarily like each other
and it's a pain in the ass because of all

1550
01:29:43,801 --> 01:29:48,270
the weird ego shit. And so I kinda
like that. I can at least for awhile,

1551
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,140
make a living sitting in a
room alone. You know, it's,

1552
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:54,210
it's got its ups and its downs.
Of course.

1553
01:29:54,211 --> 01:29:57,630
There's also a positive aspect from the
reader's point of view that if I read a

1554
01:29:57,631 --> 01:30:00,240
Chris Ryan Book,
I know I'm getting Chris Ryan's thoughts.

1555
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:05,330
They're coming unadulterated from
your mind to your typewriter, your,

1556
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,700
your keyboard rather. Yeah. And that's
something I'm conscious of. You know,

1557
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:12,240
I read this, I don't know, maybe it was
the book you recommended to me, the,

1558
01:30:12,290 --> 01:30:16,200
the war of art, but somewhere I read, um,

1559
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:21,330
someone said always right post
humorously, Ooh, you know,

1560
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:25,920
write as if you're dead because you will
be, and the book will still be there.

1561
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:31,040
Wow. So like, let go, you
know, say what's true. Yeah,

1562
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:33,420
yeah, yeah. That's amazing. Yeah.
That's way better than like,

1563
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:34,920
if you're like a Beverly hills housewife,

1564
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:37,770
you're going to write some shit
that's only based on, you know,

1565
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:40,860
like what's gonna sell. Yeah. You
know? Yeah. You know what I mean?

1566
01:30:40,861 --> 01:30:43,440
Like they'll create these,
you know, things like, okay,

1567
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:46,710
how is this going to work the best? I
mean, and I don't mean to single them out,

1568
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:47,371
but I mean,

1569
01:30:47,371 --> 01:30:50,560
just like there's some people that write
some books where it's pretty obvious as

1570
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:51,301
they're writing the book,

1571
01:30:51,301 --> 01:30:54,370
they're kind of bullshitting who
they are and what you're projecting.

1572
01:30:54,620 --> 01:30:56,460
This will connect with
that part of the audience,

1573
01:30:56,461 --> 01:31:00,180
but I don't want to offend that part.
So we got to, yeah, yeah. You know,

1574
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:03,450
you're talking earlier about
that whole ebb and flow idea,

1575
01:31:03,451 --> 01:31:06,780
the mathematical sort of,
it all equals out at the end.

1576
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:11,330
I've thought about that a lot. Not so
much in terms of individuals though.

1577
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:15,600
It makes sense, but I thought about that
a lot in terms of a historical moments,

1578
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:19,950
historical periods, you know, like
Vietnam, the, the late sixties right?

1579
01:31:19,951 --> 01:31:23,700
Like 65 to 71 that's when you know,

1580
01:31:23,701 --> 01:31:26,580
more Americans are dying in Vietnam,
right?

1581
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:30,270
Then any other period earlier than
that, it'd be four. They ramped up.

1582
01:31:30,271 --> 01:31:33,720
It wasn't as many.
So you've got all this conflict,

1583
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:35,580
all these riots in the streets.

1584
01:31:35,581 --> 01:31:39,180
You've got Selma and Martin Luther
King and all this agitation.

1585
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:42,420
And at the same time you've got Jimmy
Hendrix, you've got the Beatles,

1586
01:31:42,421 --> 01:31:43,500
you've got all of his music.

1587
01:31:43,501 --> 01:31:47,970
We're talking about amazing literature
coming out of that fashion craziness,

1588
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,460
tie dyes and Afros and you know,

1589
01:31:50,461 --> 01:31:54,690
it's like when the shit hits the fan,
it's really interesting,

1590
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:59,980
you know, and interesting people rise
to the top. Whereas when things stable,

1591
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,150
the interesting people
just, you know, they didn't,

1592
01:32:02,190 --> 01:32:04,030
they don't get anywhere because it's to,

1593
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:07,360
the structures are rigid and controlling,
you know,

1594
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:12,870
well sometimes there's a need for reform
and change that makes these interesting

1595
01:32:13,871 --> 01:32:15,730
things blossom.
Almost had a pressure,

1596
01:32:16,060 --> 01:32:19,570
almost sounded like two rocks pushing
together and they create or you know,

1597
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:20,381
there's,

1598
01:32:20,381 --> 01:32:23,770
there's this effect that happens because
people are pushed into a certain way.

1599
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:27,520
And then that sense is always been the
argument that we need a certain amount of

1600
01:32:27,550 --> 01:32:31,510
evil to appreciate, love to
appreciate happiness and good times.

1601
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:34,900
We almost need a certain amount,
like people who,

1602
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:38,530
this is a certainly no way supporting war,

1603
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,970
but people who look at war,
uh,

1604
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:46,060
like people in this country especially
as just something and they don't,

1605
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:47,770
they don't think about it deeply.

1606
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,690
They don't think about it in a way where
they comprehend the loss of lives and

1607
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:55,930
the sadness and the sorrow. They just
look at it as those were our heroes.

1608
01:32:55,931 --> 01:32:58,680
They got to do what they gotta do over
there so we could do what we do over here

1609
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:03,370
or Rod Woo. And it's like this really
surface way of looking at this thing.

1610
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:08,760
But it's almost because they are
not experiencing the suffering.

1611
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:11,680
It's almost because they're
not experiencing the
sorrow that they don't have

1612
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:12,401
this,
this,

1613
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:16,330
this appreciate like the appreciation
that you have of not being at war

1614
01:33:16,331 --> 01:33:19,900
shouldn't be that someone's over there
fighting war so that you don't have to

1615
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:23,980
have war. It should be that you, you,
you realize that people can get along,

1616
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,950
that people can love each other. There
could be friendly, we can be nice.

1617
01:33:26,951 --> 01:33:30,190
You can go to a farmer's
market and everybody's saying
hi. You know, you could,

1618
01:33:30,220 --> 01:33:31,690
you know, that's a bad
example, but you know,

1619
01:33:31,810 --> 01:33:36,160
we can interact with each other in a in
a positive way or we could fight over an

1620
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,280
oil whole,
you know,

1621
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:41,680
we could shoot each other and kill babies
and the fucking gun down innocence and

1622
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:43,870
untold numbers over an oil whole.

1623
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:48,160
I mean it's almost like having
the no interaction with it,

1624
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:49,011
having an,

1625
01:33:49,011 --> 01:33:54,011
and also having this sort of archetypal
patriotism that everyone subscribes to

1626
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:58,480
that sort of like there's a
very cookie cutter vibration.

1627
01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:02,410
There's certain types of Patriot
type people give off where it's like,

1628
01:34:02,411 --> 01:34:04,330
it's really like this is
where we're going to operate.

1629
01:34:04,331 --> 01:34:07,870
We're going to operate in this very small
box where the soldiers are heroes and

1630
01:34:07,871 --> 01:34:10,570
there's no, there's no doubt they're
doing what they do over there.

1631
01:34:10,571 --> 01:34:13,960
So we could do what we do over here and
they'll repeat that mantra over and over

1632
01:34:13,961 --> 01:34:18,961
again without any consideration whatsoever
for what it means as human beings

1633
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:22,780
that you're, you're, you're dealing
with groups of human beings,

1634
01:34:22,781 --> 01:34:24,460
fighting other groups of human beings.

1635
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:29,020
For some reason that has not really been
clearly defined to me that most of the

1636
01:34:29,170 --> 01:34:32,380
people fighting, I have no clue what
it is. Yeah. Then most none of us do.

1637
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:33,570
Very few of us did.

1638
01:34:33,790 --> 01:34:37,810
And I think that for someone who,

1639
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:40,450
for someone who goes over there and,

1640
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:44,350
and experiences that it's probably got
to be really weird to see that sort of

1641
01:34:44,351 --> 01:34:49,280
cookie cutter version of it. Um,
being expressed by people. Like, uh,

1642
01:34:49,630 --> 01:34:51,970
I have quite a few friends that have,
uh,

1643
01:34:52,090 --> 01:34:56,380
been overseas and been involved in
the war and you talk to them and man,

1644
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:59,190
they have sorrow,
they have some horrible stories.

1645
01:34:59,191 --> 01:35:01,790
They have some shit they don't like
to remember. They have some, you know,

1646
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:04,490
some really difficult things on there.
You know,

1647
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:06,540
this Brian Williams thing that
happened in the news. Yeah.

1648
01:35:06,950 --> 01:35:11,450
One of the things that I took from
it especially hard was not that Brian

1649
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:15,470
Williams was not telling the truth because
I think he's a fucking Hollywood guy.

1650
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:19,020
He's just a show Biz guy. He's an
actor, he's an actor. He's an active,

1651
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:23,990
that reads the prompter. Instead of the
script, he acts like a standard actor.

1652
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:28,130
They have the tie and they w
they talk like most of them do.

1653
01:35:28,490 --> 01:35:31,970
I made a mistake, you know, like, come
on man, you're fucking lying. You lied.

1654
01:35:31,971 --> 01:35:33,830
You lied about some shit that went down.

1655
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:39,130
But what would hit hit me harder was the
pilot that was involved because there

1656
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:43,010
was a pilot involve that gave his version
of the story and did some interviews

1657
01:35:43,011 --> 01:35:45,270
and he said that,
um,

1658
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:50,060
they were in a helicopter
and the helicopter took
small arms fire and that the

1659
01:35:50,061 --> 01:35:52,520
helicopter in front of them is
the one that got hit with the RPG.

1660
01:35:52,730 --> 01:35:55,070
And it wasn't the one that
Brian Williams is in. Um,

1661
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:59,300
but he was telling you a story about
this and then people started questioning,

1662
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:01,220
no, you weren't in the
helicopter with Brian Williams.

1663
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,310
This guy was in the helicopter, Brian
Williams. And so the guy says, man,

1664
01:36:04,311 --> 01:36:08,150
you know what? I don't really
completely remember, but what I, uh,

1665
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,940
it's hard for me to go over this.
I had put it aside,

1666
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:13,790
but now that I'm being forced to remember
the nightmares are coming back and I'm

1667
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:16,400
having a really hard time sleeping
really. And he was talking about, he said,

1668
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:18,340
I don't really want to talk
about it anymore. I you no.

1669
01:36:18,341 --> 01:36:21,470
I said what I had to say is,
isn't this guy is certainly not lying.

1670
01:36:21,471 --> 01:36:23,480
He certainly did serve.
He certainly did get shot at.

1671
01:36:23,481 --> 01:36:25,970
He certainly did see some horrific things.
There's no doubt about that.

1672
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:29,180
No one questions that they're
just questioning these, uh, these,

1673
01:36:29,330 --> 01:36:32,690
his version of events versus a couple
other people have their version of the

1674
01:36:32,691 --> 01:36:36,440
events and there's just so much trauma
involved in this guy's experiences over

1675
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:37,190
there that he's like,

1676
01:36:37,190 --> 01:36:41,960
I had tried my best to forget about this
was what I can remember when people ask

1677
01:36:41,961 --> 01:36:44,540
me about my experience with Brian
Williams, this is what happened.

1678
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:47,540
And he gave it very logical account of it.
The reason why we were an hour late,

1679
01:36:47,541 --> 01:36:49,430
he said it,
cause we had a drop off a payload.

1680
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,530
We dropped off our payload
and then we went to the,

1681
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:54,610
it took us about an hour and then we went
to the site where the guys landed with

1682
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:58,100
and then we all had huddled down
together in a snow sandstorm and it,

1683
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:02,690
it was an incredibly traumatic
event for all involved. So it,

1684
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,960
I'm not giving Brian Williams a free pass
because he remembered this in a fucked

1685
01:37:05,961 --> 01:37:07,550
up way cause I do think he bullshitted it.

1686
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,960
I think he added a bunch of shit to his
version of it and put himself in more

1687
01:37:11,961 --> 01:37:14,240
danger because he didn't think that
anybody would put the pieces together.

1688
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,530
And when it came out,

1689
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:19,880
look Historia as itself would have been
just as good if he said the helicopter

1690
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:24,410
in front of us got hit with an RPG isn't
make you better because you almost died.

1691
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,040
You don't definitely almost died anyway.
Like his version, the real version,

1692
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:32,030
he almost died. The real version.
He still was in a convoy.

1693
01:37:32,031 --> 01:37:33,680
They got shot at his helicopter.

1694
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:37,520
Didn't there were all forced to land
and endure a sandstorm for two days.

1695
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:40,370
I mean that version is amazing.
You don't have to, but it's,

1696
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:43,640
it's indicative of the kind of bullshit
artists that we have that are reading

1697
01:37:43,641 --> 01:37:47,420
off the news that he didn't like that
version. He wanted to jazz it up.

1698
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:51,410
He wanted to make a little bit better.
My life was in danger for the news.

1699
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:56,340
But it is, as we started this
conversation, talking how an unreliable

1700
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,000
memory is, right. And Milan Kundera said,

1701
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:04,770
memory is not the opposite of forgetting.
It's a way of forgetting, right?

1702
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:08,720
Because we do, we remember things,
things you know, based on emotions and,

1703
01:38:08,721 --> 01:38:12,870
and over time it changes.
And especially a story like that.

1704
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:15,720
I know a guy who's a compulsive liar.
I mean,

1705
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:19,950
within 15 minutes of meeting this guy,
he told me he had trained with the seals,

1706
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:25,050
he had played semi professional basketball
in Europe and he owned this amazing

1707
01:38:25,051 --> 01:38:27,860
apartment that we were in
that I knew he didn't know.

1708
01:38:27,861 --> 01:38:32,861
And His boss owned who was
this billionaire guy and
he was the private pilot of

1709
01:38:33,781 --> 01:38:35,670
this billionaire guy, this
friend of mine, right?

1710
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:38,970
And so I knew this guy was full of shit,

1711
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:43,971
but I also knew he flies a fucking
Leer jet for a living and he's like on

1712
01:38:44,041 --> 01:38:48,050
standby to fly this guy wherever
around the world. Like, dude,

1713
01:38:48,051 --> 01:38:52,050
that's a good story in itself.
You don't need to lie.

1714
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:56,580
You know the guy who's working
at Starbucks, okay, you
make up some shit. Why not?

1715
01:38:56,581 --> 01:39:00,600
You know, it gets you through the
night, but you're fucking pilot.

1716
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:02,130
Like I knew a dude who is this,

1717
01:39:02,210 --> 01:39:05,970
the successful comedian
and a multimillionaire and
was, would do really well,

1718
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:07,590
but he would be,
he's a compulsive liar.

1719
01:39:07,980 --> 01:39:11,640
If you start talking to them about
something that you do uniquely,

1720
01:39:11,641 --> 01:39:15,450
he would also do it. You know, like if you
talked to him about, you know, whatever,

1721
01:39:15,451 --> 01:39:17,760
going to the jungle and researching ants,

1722
01:39:18,250 --> 01:39:20,380
he would tell you about
his time researching.

1723
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,440
It was a little better than your story.
Right.

1724
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:26,250
He smoked cigarettes and he would tell
me about his kickboxing experiences with

1725
01:39:26,251 --> 01:39:28,820
world champions.
I mean,

1726
01:39:29,070 --> 01:39:33,890
palsy like to get into your realm,
right? Oh, it was ridiculous or funny.

1727
01:39:33,891 --> 01:39:37,670
That's, that's risks. High risk.
Well, he was crazy. Completely still.

1728
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:40,500
It is completely crazy. But he's really
talented too, which is interesting.

1729
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:44,460
And he's a really good comic. So it's like
it's, I can't give his name away folks.

1730
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:48,810
I'm so sorry. So maybe he, maybe
he likes the thrill like that.

1731
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:50,880
Maybe you're going to call them
out. Nope, I don't think so.

1732
01:39:50,881 --> 01:39:52,550
There's no masochistic,
no,

1733
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:56,880
just ego and alcohol and a bunch of
craziness, but smoking cigarettes,

1734
01:39:56,881 --> 01:39:59,760
telling me about how he's just sparring
eight rounds with a world champion,

1735
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:02,490
which isn't totally impossible.

1736
01:40:02,491 --> 01:40:05,430
I had this guy in Joe Schilling recently
is one of the best kickboxers in the

1737
01:40:05,431 --> 01:40:08,340
world and he admitted on the podcast he
smoked cigarettes on a regular basis.

1738
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,900
I guess I'm fucking crazy.

1739
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:14,310
But he's also outside of that
very dedicated as an athlete.

1740
01:40:14,311 --> 01:40:17,160
It's just ridiculous that he
smoked cigarettes, endurance sport.

1741
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:21,060
But he's a bad motherfucker. I mean
like bona fide legit trains all day.

1742
01:40:21,061 --> 01:40:23,550
This guy wasn't training guys
drinking all the time. He's like,

1743
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:26,590
I know he wasn't kickboxing
like he's nuts. Like it's just,

1744
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,310
but he almost can't help himself.
He has to just,

1745
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:33,620
he starts talking and he just comes out
and he gets away. There's a weird stuff,

1746
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:37,400
craziness. I, I remember meeting
a guy once at a wine tasting, uh,

1747
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:41,690
who told me he was a demigod. What does
that mean? Well that's what I asked.

1748
01:40:41,691 --> 01:40:45,710
Like what does that mean? Well it means
I'm, I'm half human. My father was human,

1749
01:40:45,711 --> 01:40:48,110
my mother was from,
and he tells him like some,

1750
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:52,220
some Latin word for a star
system somewhere. And uh,

1751
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:57,230
and he said like again, within
15 minutes he said, uh, that, uh,

1752
01:40:57,250 --> 01:41:02,050
he was the highest paid artist in the
world because he had designed the,

1753
01:41:02,051 --> 01:41:06,610
that atlas a thing in front of
Rockefeller Center, which was the highest,

1754
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:10,030
the most expensive piece of art, any
whatever, like whatever, blah, blah.

1755
01:41:10,510 --> 01:41:14,350
And I was fascinated it and the
guy was super good looking dude.

1756
01:41:14,351 --> 01:41:19,030
Like he had like a little beard and
a bit, he was big and dark, you know,

1757
01:41:19,031 --> 01:41:22,330
he looked like Satan Mephistopheles
kind of thing, you know.

1758
01:41:22,890 --> 01:41:24,370
And I thought he was bullshitting me.

1759
01:41:24,371 --> 01:41:28,840
I thought that my friend had like put
him up to it cause I was high and I was

1760
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:31,420
just like, so he thought he was just
acting like, it was just being silly.

1761
01:41:31,421 --> 01:41:33,130
I thought he was goofing off,
you know?

1762
01:41:33,131 --> 01:41:36,340
And that after a few minutes he'd break
character and we'd all get a good laugh

1763
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:39,070
out of it. And I even called my friend,
I was like, hey Dave, come over here.

1764
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:41,890
I'm talking to the devil here.
He's got some great stories.

1765
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:47,230
And then Cassie was there
and then she came and he,

1766
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:51,190
and he got into her and he started
trying to impress her and telling her all

1767
01:41:51,191 --> 01:41:52,750
these stories. And she's
a psychiatrist, right?

1768
01:41:52,751 --> 01:41:56,920
She sees bullshit like before the rest
of us even know it's coming. You know,

1769
01:41:57,590 --> 01:42:02,530
it was very funny, like
the whole interaction. Wow.
Yeah. But it's a, it's a,

1770
01:42:02,531 --> 01:42:06,460
it's a form of insanity. You know,
like people have to scratch that Itch,

1771
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:08,170
I don't know.
And they kind of keep moving.

1772
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,950
Those people almost by nature have to
keep moving because eventually leave a

1773
01:42:11,951 --> 01:42:16,750
mess behind them. The lives implode,
the lies come down and cave in on them,

1774
01:42:16,751 --> 01:42:20,650
and then they've got to find some new
person to sucker in. And that does happen.

1775
01:42:20,651 --> 01:42:21,580
You know,
you see that,

1776
01:42:21,581 --> 01:42:25,300
you see people drifting from one group
of people to the other group of people.

1777
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:28,420
And I've seen it. I've seen
it happen. Yeah, it's weird.

1778
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:31,690
It's weird when you meet someone who's
just obviously full of shit and lying

1779
01:42:31,691 --> 01:42:34,870
through their teeth as they're talking
to. It's a very strange thing. Like,

1780
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:35,501
do you know that?

1781
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:38,860
I know and you're just gonna like hope
that I don't call you on it because

1782
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:43,660
you've seen that too. Yeah. I wonder
about that too. Like some people,

1783
01:42:44,110 --> 01:42:47,560
well again, you know, my
wife's a psychiatrist, she,

1784
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:51,010
she's dealt with all of this
kind of stuff and she laughs.

1785
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,670
She just cracks up when she sees it,
she sees it immediately.

1786
01:42:54,671 --> 01:42:59,671
And just like her way of dealing with
insanity is laughter and is she works with

1787
01:43:00,380 --> 01:43:01,930
what she's worked with
all sorts of people,

1788
01:43:01,931 --> 01:43:06,400
but her sort of
specialization is loony Bin,

1789
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:09,520
like a one flew over the cuckoo's
nest kind of scenes. Right. I,

1790
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:13,060
I remember going in with her the
first time I visited her at work,

1791
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:17,650
she was a running a mental hospital
with like double doors and bars over the

1792
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:22,080
windows, these criminally insane people
who had killed their kids and you know,

1793
01:43:22,150 --> 01:43:23,620
like crazy shit.
Right.

1794
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:27,220
And we went in there and
I wasn't prepared man.

1795
01:43:27,221 --> 01:43:32,221
We went in and it was just like lunatics
and there was this woman like must have

1796
01:43:33,221 --> 01:43:37,270
been in her mid fifties lying on
her back and a little nightgown,

1797
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:40,660
no underwear with her, like
arms and legs, you know,

1798
01:43:40,661 --> 01:43:45,070
like a crab doing a crab thing and we
walk in and it's like this, you know,

1799
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:50,250
pussy in the whole scene just scared
the shit out of me and just started

1800
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:54,750
laughing like you crazy old lady. What
are you doing? Get off from there.

1801
01:43:55,940 --> 01:44:00,230
She just like last and the thing that I
didn't understand until I hung out with

1802
01:44:00,231 --> 01:44:03,980
her is that people who are psychotic,
no,

1803
01:44:03,981 --> 01:44:08,981
they're psychotic and so they kind
of know how ridiculous they are.

1804
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:14,210
And as a doctor when she laughs,

1805
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:17,300
she laughs in such a loving,
accepting,

1806
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:22,010
I get you kind of way that it creates
this instant report and they start

1807
01:44:22,011 --> 01:44:26,720
laughing. Oh. So she like relieves a
little tension, right? Like it's all okay.

1808
01:44:26,721 --> 01:44:28,760
I know you're just another crazy person.

1809
01:44:28,761 --> 01:44:32,150
I deal with you all the time and come
on. It's, it's Kinda like how you know,

1810
01:44:32,151 --> 01:44:37,151
like a gynecologist I imagine would
have to sort of be so laid back that you

1811
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,550
kind of, you know, okay. He seen
a million pussies, you know,

1812
01:44:40,551 --> 01:44:45,080
like it relaxes you in a way, you know?
And I think she does that with, uh,

1813
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:49,220
with crazy people. It's normal people
who make her really uncomfortable.

1814
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:49,901
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1815
01:44:49,901 --> 01:44:52,600
imagine if you were a gynecologist and
you were super nervous about seeing

1816
01:44:52,601 --> 01:44:53,434
someone's post.

1817
01:44:55,210 --> 01:44:59,620
Okay. I guess we're about to do that.
Hold on. I have some water on my face.

1818
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:02,980
Let me have a little more wine.
Just another days off.

1819
01:45:04,740 --> 01:45:07,810
That's happening. All right, let's
see what you got wrong down there.

1820
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:11,980
I'm looking,
going to use a mirror.

1821
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:17,560
I get some fucking van buyer. It's
Medusa. You can't look at it in the eyes.

1822
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:21,800
So if you had to have a job,
like a normal job,

1823
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:24,380
what job would you be good at or what,
what would you want to do?

1824
01:45:24,381 --> 01:45:26,060
Not a gynecologist,
I imagine.

1825
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:31,350
Uh, outside of comedy I would
probably be a martial arts instructor.

1826
01:45:31,530 --> 01:45:34,140
I enjoyed doing that. You liked
teaching? Yeah, I enjoyed teaching.

1827
01:45:34,141 --> 01:45:37,200
But you're good with kids.
I'll bet I enjoyed it. Yeah.
I use to teach kids class.

1828
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:39,900
I taught a lot of kids.
I taught kids a up.

1829
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:45,080
I taught several kids from white belt
all the way up to a higher belts.

1830
01:45:45,480 --> 01:45:47,490
Like I don't think a ton
anybody up to black belt,

1831
01:45:47,491 --> 01:45:51,450
but I got pretty close because it takes
quite a few years to achieve black belt.

1832
01:45:51,451 --> 01:45:56,250
So for most of them, that is very rare
that they make it to that far. Like there,

1833
01:45:56,251 --> 01:45:59,430
they'll learn some lessons along the way
and it'll help them, you know, in life.

1834
01:45:59,431 --> 01:46:03,960
But to achieve that level
of, of a fee of ability, it,

1835
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:06,690
there's a lot of commitment.
So most of them didn't make it.

1836
01:46:06,691 --> 01:46:09,660
It's like maybe one out of a thousand
ever make it to black belt. Really.

1837
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:12,240
Probably in a good school maybe.

1838
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:16,560
I mean might be one out of
500 or 600 but it's whatever.

1839
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:18,580
It's close to 10,000 whatever it is.
It's,

1840
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:21,180
it's not 1% by any stretch
of the imagination.

1841
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:26,100
It's probably a good estimate is
one 10th of 1% right. You know, so,

1842
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:27,850
but yeah,
I enjoy you.

1843
01:46:27,851 --> 01:46:30,670
I imagine you'd be really good
in that kind of an environment.

1844
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:33,600
Not just martial arts but kids in general.
Cause the,

1845
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:38,500
there's like a sort of an immediate
respect. You know, like you're,

1846
01:46:38,501 --> 01:46:42,070
you know, you look like a bad ass. So
it's like, oh me take that guy seriously.

1847
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:46,120
Well I like kids and you're amenable.
You're open to

1848
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,930
I also, I'm a big take
in strays. SORTA. Oui.

1849
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,810
I've always taken the stray
dogs and cats and yeah,

1850
01:46:52,860 --> 01:46:56,190
I've been following your Instagram. Lots
of good catch that's in there recently.

1851
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:59,970
I got a new kitten. I love cats,
man. I do too. They're fun.

1852
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,640
They're fun to have around. They don't
require your constant attention to,

1853
01:47:02,730 --> 01:47:06,570
they got dignity. They got their own
life man. And especially the key which,

1854
01:47:06,571 --> 01:47:10,080
which you obviously understand
is have multiple cats.

1855
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,590
Don't have one cat cause then you're
going to have the neurotic freaked out cat

1856
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:15,230
pissing in your bed.
But you have it.

1857
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:18,690
The difference between no
cat and a cat is significant.

1858
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:22,480
The difference we one cat in two
cats is negligible. Yeah. Right.

1859
01:47:22,481 --> 01:47:25,260
So as far as like the whole on whatever.
Yeah.

1860
01:47:25,261 --> 01:47:28,020
I mean so get a few cats if
you're going to get a cat.

1861
01:47:28,021 --> 01:47:31,680
And so they have each other when
you're not around. Yeah. Yeah.

1862
01:47:31,681 --> 01:47:33,960
I got three of them.
That's what we had three

1863
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:36,750
plan. You know, interesting enough. Um,

1864
01:47:36,850 --> 01:47:40,600
teaching was one of the things that
really helped me on fear factor,

1865
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,260
which fear factor seems like a such a
stupid show. And it was kind of dumb.

1866
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:46,000
But um,

1867
01:47:46,060 --> 01:47:49,420
it was some people that were like really
freaked out and didn't know how to deal

1868
01:47:49,421 --> 01:47:53,030
with like the stress of competition.
And I was so used to it. Oh,

1869
01:47:53,031 --> 01:47:57,880
so you used to not just, not
just teaching, but coaching.
Like, even when I retired,

1870
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:02,080
my friend Dimitri was a fighting in this
big national tournament and I was in

1871
01:48:02,081 --> 01:48:04,880
his corner for like,
and I pumped him up like during the,

1872
01:48:04,881 --> 01:48:06,460
it was like one of his
best performances ever.

1873
01:48:06,461 --> 01:48:08,890
Like I'm good at getting
inside of people's heads,

1874
01:48:08,891 --> 01:48:12,400
especially people that I know and telling
them what they need to hear to get

1875
01:48:12,401 --> 01:48:15,700
them to go out there and fire him the
fuck up, you know, and telling them like,

1876
01:48:15,701 --> 01:48:17,590
what you're really good at man,
you can do this.

1877
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:19,450
And it's all about not having any doubt.

1878
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:22,830
It's all about knowing how to stay
in tents and focused and, and, and,

1879
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:25,180
and go out there and do
what needs to be done and,

1880
01:48:25,181 --> 01:48:29,650
and giving them this sort of technical
advice as well as like this emotional

1881
01:48:29,651 --> 01:48:33,310
pick me up like some,
some people have like a knack for that.

1882
01:48:33,311 --> 01:48:37,390
And I developed it by teaching kids
because kids are always freaked out, man.

1883
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:39,730
I took a lot of kids to
tournaments and you know,

1884
01:48:39,731 --> 01:48:42,580
they'd be fighting other little kids
and most likely they wouldn't get hurt.

1885
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:45,490
But you know when you got a little seven
year old in front of you and you're

1886
01:48:45,491 --> 01:48:49,090
putting pads on his head to protect
him from Kix and you're like, listen,

1887
01:48:49,150 --> 01:48:51,790
you just got to stay
focused and don't be afraid.

1888
01:48:52,030 --> 01:48:54,220
All you need to think
about is what you're doing.

1889
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:57,550
Don't think about what happens if
it goes wrong. Never think of that.

1890
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:00,760
Always think about what are you
trying to do and if things go wrong,

1891
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:04,590
reset and think about it again. What is
my objective? What am I trying to do?

1892
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:08,260
Stay defensive. Keep moving. Never
stand in one place at one it, you know,

1893
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:11,020
never stand put. Always,
always keep fainting.

1894
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:14,260
Always keep the opponent guessing and
I'd go over all the most important things

1895
01:49:14,261 --> 01:49:16,300
to them and then pump them
up and tell you can do this.

1896
01:49:16,310 --> 01:49:18,220
When you get through this,
you're going to feel so good.

1897
01:49:18,221 --> 01:49:21,700
I know you feel terrible now, but it's
terrible as you feel now when it's over,

1898
01:49:21,701 --> 01:49:24,100
you're going to feel so good. And when
they would do it and it would compete,

1899
01:49:24,101 --> 01:49:26,110
even if they would lose, he'd
be so relieved. I'm like, see,

1900
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:30,190
now you feel good and this, this,
this experience is horrifying.

1901
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:35,110
Stressful experience can give birth
to this new appreciation of peace,

1902
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:35,650
right,
right.

1903
01:49:35,650 --> 01:49:38,590
It's the, it's the Ying Yang again,
right? You were talking about earlier,

1904
01:49:38,830 --> 01:49:43,390
I read a book recently, a fascinating
book called a paradise made in hell.

1905
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:48,580
Uh,
Rebecca Solnit and it's about a sociology,

1906
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:53,050
right? So it's studying people's
behaviors in a behavior in disasters,

1907
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:57,700
right? And so it's fascinating
because the idea we have is like,

1908
01:49:57,701 --> 01:50:01,750
that's when people get really crazy and
they, you loot and pillage and the, Oh,

1909
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:05,980
now I can rape and nobody will catch
me there. No cops. And in fact,

1910
01:50:05,981 --> 01:50:09,760
what happens is the opposite.
That that's when people are most generous,

1911
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:12,730
most kind. They've formed
communities, they meet the neighbors,

1912
01:50:12,731 --> 01:50:14,800
they never said a fucking
word to for 10 years.

1913
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:18,820
They're like taking care
of each other and people,

1914
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:23,710
and it sort of relates to war too. You
know, people look back on it and they say,

1915
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:24,041
yeah,

1916
01:50:24,041 --> 01:50:27,010
there was a lot of horrible shit that
people were dying and stuff was happening.

1917
01:50:27,340 --> 01:50:31,960
But I remembered as the best time
in my life. And the main guy,

1918
01:50:31,961 --> 01:50:35,890
there's this really moving passage where
this guy who sort of started the field,

1919
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:39,030
who's no Hippie, he's, you know,
teachers at Nebraska or something.

1920
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:42,910
He's like very straight up
scientist. But he said, he said,

1921
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:47,970
the best way to think about
disasters is not as a disaster,

1922
01:50:48,221 --> 01:50:52,660
but as relief from the
disaster that is normal life.

1923
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:58,540
Because the normal life, we're all
isolated. We're all suffering alone.

1924
01:50:59,140 --> 01:51:01,030
And he's like, man, when
the shit hits the fan,

1925
01:51:01,090 --> 01:51:03,100
that's when things get really wonderful.

1926
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:05,820
What?
Well,

1927
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:08,690
there's no escaping the fact that it's
finite when you're watching people die

1928
01:51:08,691 --> 01:51:10,020
around you, that's for sure. Yeah.

1929
01:51:10,260 --> 01:51:12,570
Yeah. Well, and again, it's like
you were saying about, you know,

1930
01:51:12,571 --> 01:51:14,940
you need the pain to enjoy the pleasure.

1931
01:51:14,941 --> 01:51:17,640
You need hunger to enjoy
the food you need, you know,

1932
01:51:17,641 --> 01:51:21,600
loneliness to enjoy companionship.
There is no light without

1933
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:24,720
dark. There really isn't.
Right. And I think people, uh,

1934
01:51:25,020 --> 01:51:29,040
one of the things that people miss in
their lives that leads people to become

1935
01:51:29,041 --> 01:51:32,760
very stagnant and,
and disappointed and,

1936
01:51:32,761 --> 01:51:36,090
and their existence is that
there's no thrills. You know?

1937
01:51:36,091 --> 01:51:39,120
I think that's what leads people to um,
you know,

1938
01:51:39,121 --> 01:51:43,440
to get divorced or to get to become
drug addicts or to be self destructive.

1939
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:47,430
It's almost like people need thrills and
when you get stuck in a really secure

1940
01:51:47,431 --> 01:51:51,930
job or you know, all right Chris
Ryan for the next 40 hours,

1941
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,180
you know, you're going to be
stuck in this spot or you know,

1942
01:51:54,181 --> 01:51:57,690
eight hours a day for the next, you know,
seven days, five days, whatever it is.

1943
01:51:57,691 --> 01:52:01,200
You're going to be stuck in this spot
and you're going to be at this desk and

1944
01:52:01,201 --> 01:52:04,230
you're going to be dealing with all
these cases that come your way and you're

1945
01:52:04,231 --> 01:52:05,370
going to have to file them.

1946
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:08,100
And then you're going to have to write
a report and it's going to suck and

1947
01:52:08,101 --> 01:52:11,700
you're going to just be lumped in to this
group of people that are all doing the

1948
01:52:11,701 --> 01:52:14,460
same thing. And you're going to do it
every week. And at the end of the week,

1949
01:52:14,520 --> 01:52:18,630
you know, when, when the day's done,
then you can go home and you can relax,

1950
01:52:18,631 --> 01:52:20,620
but there's going to be
no thrills. The, the,

1951
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:23,850
the biggest thrill would be merging
onto the highway. Oh my God. Here we go.

1952
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:25,410
Like other than that,
there's nothing.

1953
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,920
There's no ups is all
just steady and normal.

1954
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:32,340
And I think that's one of the reasons
why people have so much road rage and

1955
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:35,480
stress in there. There's
no right. Oh, real

1956
01:52:35,480 --> 01:52:39,740
experience. There's no, they're not
flushing out. I often say in Spanish,

1957
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:44,770
the word Isilon means both
to insulate and to isolate.

1958
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:46,400
Mm.

1959
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:49,850
So we, you know, and this gets
into this whole book I'm writing,

1960
01:52:49,851 --> 01:52:54,851
like civilization is largely an attempt
to insulate ourselves from a danger from

1961
01:52:58,611 --> 01:53:02,960
strangers, from any sort
of, uh, predators, you know,

1962
01:53:02,961 --> 01:53:05,450
from anything that
could be a danger to us.

1963
01:53:05,451 --> 01:53:09,620
We try to insulate ourselves from it and
then at the end were isolated, right?

1964
01:53:09,621 --> 01:53:14,510
Because we're surrounded by this margin,
this moat that protects us from what?

1965
01:53:14,511 --> 01:53:19,490
From farm life, right? From the thing
that makes you feel alive. Like, okay,

1966
01:53:19,491 --> 01:53:24,350
you want to be completely safe, you know,
get inside this coffin, you know, and uh,

1967
01:53:24,351 --> 01:53:27,470
you know, take some anesthetics and
you won't feel a God damn thing,

1968
01:53:27,471 --> 01:53:29,120
but how's that different from me dead?

1969
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:34,040
It seems like we're all doing our
part in this existence and we're,

1970
01:53:34,190 --> 01:53:38,870
we're moving past what we used to be
from single celled organisms to higher

1971
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:41,660
primates to some weird thing right now.

1972
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:45,830
That's a combination of conscious
being and, and physical animal.

1973
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:50,330
And someone like Dunkin sounded like
Duncan and we're moving in this sort of

1974
01:53:50,331 --> 01:53:55,180
advancing direction and it's not,
it's not done. You know, we're, we're,

1975
01:53:55,420 --> 01:54:00,060
yeah, we're a part of a great process
and what the stage that you and I are in,

1976
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:03,440
but they're going to look back at us
and laugh the way we look back at Isaac

1977
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:07,190
Newton. We're in a powdered wig or you
know, any of the Weirdos that you know,

1978
01:54:07,191 --> 01:54:10,250
figured out all sorts of
incredible things back in history,

1979
01:54:10,251 --> 01:54:13,040
but also believed a bunch of
stupid shit as well. Like you,

1980
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:16,880
you look back at Copernicus and the
things that he discovered and it's

1981
01:54:16,940 --> 01:54:20,060
unbelievable and amazing,
but today it's like Duh.

1982
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:23,120
Like everybody already knows that, you
know, the look at the life that you live.

1983
01:54:23,121 --> 01:54:28,121
Like imagine being Darwin and trying to
express these ideas that you formulated

1984
01:54:28,971 --> 01:54:32,780
over the course of your, your life's
work to a bunch of Christian scientists,

1985
01:54:32,781 --> 01:54:34,400
which is what he was dealing with.

1986
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:38,120
It's hilarious if you go back
and think about it today,

1987
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:43,100
like his challenges of this
idea of this monotheistic world,

1988
01:54:43,101 --> 01:54:43,331
that they,

1989
01:54:43,331 --> 01:54:47,960
that the scientist pretty much universally
existed in at that time and, and,

1990
01:54:47,961 --> 01:54:52,160
and tries to push forth these crazy
theories that he's coming up with uniquely

1991
01:54:52,161 --> 01:54:54,110
on his own. I mean, the, the, the,

1992
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:58,250
the resistance that he must have
experienced to something that today is

1993
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:02,990
instantaneously accepted by
everyone that's in, in academia,

1994
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:07,850
in, in, in science. I mean, almost
across the board, his ideas are accepted.

1995
01:55:08,030 --> 01:55:10,820
So we look back at those
times and we'd go, God,

1996
01:55:10,821 --> 01:55:13,700
they're fucking so stupid back then.
Well, they're going to do that to us,

1997
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:16,880
you know, and it's got going to
be that long. I mean with Darwin,

1998
01:55:16,881 --> 01:55:18,590
you're talking about a
few hundred years with us,

1999
01:55:18,591 --> 01:55:22,490
it's going to be a few decades and then
a few days it goes faster and faster and

2000
01:55:22,491 --> 01:55:24,890
faster and faster. And we're,
we're in the middle of this.

2001
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:30,050
We're in the middle of this weird process
of human beings changing and becoming

2002
01:55:30,051 --> 01:55:35,051
more aware of all the flaws and the folly
in our civilization and our existence

2003
01:55:35,151 --> 01:55:36,950
and all the shit we're
fighting for it today.

2004
01:55:37,130 --> 01:55:39,800
All the protests like black
lives matter and you know,

2005
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:43,100
people fighting for rights of, you
know, everyone across the board,

2006
01:55:43,350 --> 01:55:45,690
women to gaze to this,
to that.

2007
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:49,830
Like what we're doing is we're trying to
patch up the holes in this crazy system

2008
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,880
with, with agitation and anger
and loud voices and you know,

2009
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:58,940
social media campaigns and
it's essentially all just
trying to make this thing

2010
01:55:59,010 --> 01:56:03,660
into a more coherent,
more advanced version of what it is now.

2011
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:08,160
And then that in turn will find the
inherent problems in its existence and it

2012
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:10,360
will move just like the monkeys from,
you know,

2013
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:13,440
200,000 years ago that
became human beings.

2014
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:16,600
We're fighting off all these different
creatures and realize like, yeah,

2015
01:56:16,601 --> 01:56:19,560
we got to make houses. This
is bullshit. Like this.

2016
01:56:19,730 --> 01:56:23,670
That's fucking living in trees is
bullshit. The cat's climb trees man,

2017
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,620
my fucking tired of my
baby's getting eaten.

2018
01:56:25,650 --> 01:56:28,880
Like let's figure out beers
and snakes. Yeah, let's,

2019
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:32,220
let's figure a way to
make a better situation.

2020
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,810
And I think we're in the middle of
that man. No, I think we just like,

2021
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:38,610
like all things you take it for granted
that you're in the middle of it.

2022
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:41,460
Well if you look back on your childhood,
you know,

2023
01:56:41,461 --> 01:56:43,350
and today you look back and you go,
wow,

2024
01:56:43,351 --> 01:56:45,330
when I was 10 I was doing
this and I was doing that.

2025
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:48,040
But when you were 10 you were just in
the middle of it. You know, you'll,

2026
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:50,850
you'll look back at how much progress
is taking place in your own life as a

2027
01:56:50,851 --> 01:56:55,590
microcosm tier existence. You
know, the are all of our existence.

2028
01:56:55,591 --> 01:57:00,440
You are your own individual memories in
your own individual experiences. They,

2029
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:01,590
you're in the middle of it.

2030
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:04,530
You don't think about being
what we're as civilization.

2031
01:57:04,531 --> 01:57:07,590
We're in the middle of this baby hood.
We're in the middle of this adolescents,

2032
01:57:07,591 --> 01:57:08,960
whatever the fuck it is,
you know,

2033
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:12,270
and we're moving into some
new place and it's arrogant,

2034
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:15,330
but very common for people to
think we're at the end of it.

2035
01:57:15,331 --> 01:57:18,570
Like this is the cutting edge is the edge,
but it's not the end.

2036
01:57:18,600 --> 01:57:21,720
It's not perfection. It's
like, yeah, it's always,

2037
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,540
always in process,
always in process.

2038
01:57:24,541 --> 01:57:29,541
But amazing to think that right now we
are at the pinnacle of human knowledge.

2039
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,500
We are at the peak,

2040
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:35,430
the tip of the spear as far as like
everything that people have learned and

2041
01:57:35,431 --> 01:57:39,120
figured out up until now we have this
database that we've accumulated from

2042
01:57:39,121 --> 01:57:42,510
hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
years of records. And then you know,

2043
01:57:42,511 --> 01:57:45,300
after that it gets a little sketchy
and you'd go to a few thousand years.

2044
01:57:45,301 --> 01:57:47,220
So you just get real weird
and different languages.

2045
01:57:47,221 --> 01:57:49,770
Things get even weirder and it gets
more vague and more strange and more

2046
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:50,790
difficult to decipher.

2047
01:57:51,090 --> 01:57:55,710
But all that data that we've accumulated
and the access to it that we have today,

2048
01:57:55,860 --> 01:57:59,490
unprecedented as far as we
know. And people. It's amazing.

2049
01:57:59,491 --> 01:58:02,820
It's amazing to be at that time.
Will you have a question?

2050
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,690
You just like with a psychology,
psych, psych, psychopaths,
the thing we just bang,

2051
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:09,230
we just Google it and we
didn't have to go to a library.

2052
01:58:09,231 --> 01:58:10,350
We didn't have to order a book.

2053
01:58:10,351 --> 01:58:13,590
We didn't have to go to a
bookstore or go to a class.

2054
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:18,120
You just instantaneously get that
information and I think that that is

2055
01:58:18,121 --> 01:58:23,070
accelerating us in a way that we
can't even comprehend. Yeah, no doubt.

2056
01:58:23,280 --> 01:58:25,920
Yeah. I think we're all
experiencing it in a way that's,

2057
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:31,190
it's seems so normal because
everyone has a phone, you know? Whoa.

2058
01:58:31,770 --> 01:58:34,920
Let me just check my,
my phone and see.

2059
01:58:35,100 --> 01:58:39,390
Let me just call my friend who's nowhere
near me. And you know, this affects the,

2060
01:58:39,430 --> 01:58:42,100
getting back to the earlier
thing about aging, right?

2061
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:42,933
Like I,

2062
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:47,970
this affects the experience of aging
because more has changed in our lifetimes

2063
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:52,060
because it's always
accelerating that like,

2064
01:58:52,061 --> 01:58:55,320
I remember the first computer I
interacted with, right? It was,

2065
01:58:55,360 --> 01:58:59,560
I was in my late twenties working
in the diamond district in New York,

2066
01:58:59,561 --> 01:59:03,340
and one of my jobs was to back
up the disks in this computer.

2067
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:08,470
The computer was the size of a big
refrigerator and the disks were like,

2068
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:11,770
you know, double the
circumference of a, of an album.

2069
01:59:12,130 --> 01:59:15,970
And they were these massive things and
they were probably like 50 megabytes each

2070
01:59:15,971 --> 01:59:18,550
or something, you know, if that,
right. Is that right? I mean,

2071
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:22,390
and I probably got a thousand times the
computing power in my pocket right now.

2072
01:59:22,391 --> 01:59:25,890
It's just easily insane. Maybe
even more than a thousand. Yeah.

2073
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:29,950
I don't know how it works. Yeah. Hey, I
got a role. Get outta here, man. Yeah,

2074
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:34,300
it's always going to see this weekend.
I'm tempted to like miss the plane.

2075
01:59:34,301 --> 01:59:38,170
There's just so much fun. Uh, what's that?
The planets. The rental car. Oh, okay.

2076
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:40,860
They're going to rape me if I'm late.
We'll hang out this weekend and we're,

2077
01:59:40,861 --> 01:59:43,360
we're promising to do one with you.
Me and Duncan again.

2078
01:59:43,361 --> 01:59:45,490
We're going to figure it out.
And I know we've been getting tweets.

2079
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:49,150
Everybody's busy folks. Shit happens.
Um, but we'll, we'll get it together.

2080
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:51,370
We'll get it together. But thank you
brother. Appreciate. Pick a date.

2081
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:55,330
I'll fly down for us for sure. Can you
can follow Chris on Twitter. It's a,

2082
01:59:55,331 --> 01:59:59,290

Or as Christopher Ryan, Chris
Ross, Ryan, Chris, Brian,

2083
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:01,220
Chris, Ryan, Phd. Uh,

2084
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:05,320
the one book that you can buy
that he has his sex at dawn.

2085
02:00:05,321 --> 02:00:09,820
Fantastic book, guaranteed to Piss
off your wife. Leave that shit around,

2086
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:14,410
buddy of reading, getting these fucking
ideas out of your head. Uh, Chris Ryan,

2087
02:00:14,411 --> 02:00:16,890
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank
you brother. Appreciate it,
man. It's a lot of fun. Yeah.

2088
02:00:16,990 --> 02:00:17,823
Bye Bye.

2089
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:26,013
Okay.

2090
02:00:28,230 --> 02:00:28,390
Hm.
