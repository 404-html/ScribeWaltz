1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,320
So let's talk about this rematch.

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:05,663
Which one?

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,230
Nate Diaz and Conor Mcgregor.

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,420
What are they fighting
at 55 I do not know.

6
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,860
I don't think that's been solidified.

7
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:14,340
I believe that Connor is asked for it to
take place at 70 which is where he was.

8
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,174
So he can say like,

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,110
I can do this exactly the same
weight and then it won't be a factor,

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:19,410
you know?

11
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,220
But also I think he was really healthy
at one 70 and I think you'd like it was

12
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,113
Connor.

13
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,270
I think you felt great leading up to
the camp and leading up to the fight.

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
He just had a bad game plan and his
ground Game Kinda got exposed to weight

15
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,920
classes above where you want
to title two weight classes.

16
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:35,754
It's not true.

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,211
First of all,

18
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:38,250
they both weighed in
almost exactly the same.

19
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,620
No two way classes above
where he won his title.

20
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,071
Yes.

21
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:42,240
But not really.

22
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,890
All it is is they're not cutting weight.

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,641
It's too,

24
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:45,474
but he's not white.

25
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,320
Right.

26
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,320
But he's not fighting like Damien Maia
who used to fight at two oh five or 185

27
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,260
and he's cutting down title
shop and listen that title
shots where it's like you

28
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:57,240
don't deserve title shot on
two weight classes above you.

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,440
It's just a Nate Diaz fight.

30
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,710
Well this isn't a title shot,

31
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,571
I'm saying at least.

32
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:01,170
It's like,

33
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:01,321
well,

34
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:02,550
you know the whole story behind it,

35
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:06,600
there was a fallout Hofeld dos Anjos is
the lightweight champion was supposed to

36
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:07,590
be fighting Conor McGregor.

37
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,750
He breaks his foot 11
days before the fight.

38
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,480
Nate Diaz takes the fight
at the drop of a hat.

39
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,830
No training whatsoever.

40
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,450
I mean fucking none.

41
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,710
They hadn't done anything.

42
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,520
He was at the store.

43
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:17,851
Yeah,

44
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:18,391
he was hanging,

45
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,740
hanging out and uh,

46
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,160
Nate,

47
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,610
you know,

48
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,090
posted pictures afterwards of him
drinking Tequila and hanging out in Mexico

49
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:25,110
eating tacos and shit.

50
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,200
So he was just having a car nine bitch.

51
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,250
He's just living his life.

52
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:29,491
Right.

53
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:32,820
But he's in such good shape that he can
get away with that because he does so

54
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:34,020
much triathlon training.

55
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,420
He's constantly biking
and swimming and running.

56
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,670
He entered into a bunch of triathlons.

57
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,900
He's in very good shape and so he was
able to pull it off cause his cardio base

58
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:44,040
was so good and just,

59
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,740
he's a fucking damn good fighter.

60
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,510
He's a damn good fighter.

61
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:49,410
And he signed too.

62
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,870
And he's fought legitimately
at one 70 twice.

63
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,823
He lost,

64
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,030
he lost a stun gun,

65
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:54,451
Kim.

66
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,210
And he also lost a Roy McDonald at
one 70 these are the legitimate one.

67
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:00,100
Seventies and Roy being
one of the best ones.

68
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,781
The world.

69
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,530
Yeah,

70
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,210
he got ragdolled a little bit by Rory,

71
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:05,400
but you know that was
a wake up call for him.

72
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,350
He went back to one 55 and at one 55 in
his last fight against Michael Johnson,

73
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:13,380
he put on probably the best performance
up to the Conor McGregor fight,

74
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,880
the best performance of his career.

75
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,080
He was funny sensation.

76
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,040
When I view Nate Diaz,

77
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,310
I view,

78
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,660
I think of him as a 50 fiver.

79
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,021
He,

80
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:20,700
that's what he usually competes at.

81
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,870
But for this fight,

82
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:22,920
like he didn't want to have to cut weight.

83
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:24,870
It's only 11 days out
and he's a little heavy.

84
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:25,231
So he says,

85
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:25,411
look,

86
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,970
let's make it one 70 they both agree.

87
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,691
Nate Wade,

88
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:31,500
one 69 Konner weighed one
68 or maybe vice versa.

89
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,490
I think that's it though.

90
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,240
So I mean they're basically the
same size or they fight at one.

91
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,870
Well they fought at one
70 what do you mean when,

92
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,140
when Nate said I'll fight it once every,

93
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:40,980
where was he walking up?

94
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,900
Probably a little heavier than that.

95
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:46,950
He probably died it and worked out real
hard for seven or eight days of the 11

96
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,260
carpet honors class.

97
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,870
Koppel.

98
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,141
No,

99
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:50,250
Connor didn't have to cut anything.

100
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:50,821
I mean,

101
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,511
if he cut anything,

102
00:02:51,511 --> 00:02:52,590
it probably a couple pounds,

103
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,650
which is not,

104
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,110
not not a biggest thing that happens.

105
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,320
One 70 but there's not
even 10 pounds different.

106
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,260
So the same way,

107
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,730
like when they got into the octagon,

108
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,430
I guarantee you they're within
a pound or two of each other.

109
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,680
Okay.

110
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,190
But Nate is longer and taller
and he's a very good boxer.

111
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,400
Like Nate's bars on a regular
basis with Andre Ward,

112
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,440
who was one of the best pound for pound,

113
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,780
if not the best pound for
pound box or in the world.

114
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,670
Now that Floyd Mayweather,

115
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,120
so quote unquote retired.

116
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,860
Andre Ward is a mother fucker and he just
fought this Saturday night on HBO and

117
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,060
I just watched it the other day.

118
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:25,990
Um,

119
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:26,980
on a DVR.

120
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,910
It's fucking amazing.

121
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,840
He's so good,

122
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,410
dude.

123
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:29,950
He's such a,

124
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,950
he's just nasty and he's now he's fighting
at one 75 he's gonna fight surge Jay

125
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,110
Sergey Kovalev who's like the best one,

126
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:37,030
75 are in the world.

127
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,410
So he fought so neat spars with that guy
and a day on a regular basis like their

128
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:42,190
friends.

129
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,490
And you know Nate also spars his brother
Nick cause one of the best strikers in

130
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:45,940
the UFC.

131
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,140
Definitely one of the best boxers.

132
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:47,771
You know,

133
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:48,910
he's a very good boxer.

134
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,720
And,

135
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,360
and he also spars with Joe
Schilling all the time.

136
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,140
Who is a glory world champion
kickboxing world champion.

137
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,370
He's a motherfucker man.

138
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:01,930
So native sparring with like high level
world class striker is like legitimate.

139
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,621
Andre Ward,

140
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,430
Joe Shelley,

141
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,580
two world champions in two
d respective disciplines.

142
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,450
So He's,

143
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,920
he's a bad motherfucker.

144
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,120
I just think that people,

145
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:13,930
he sees him swearing and stick it up his
double fingers and they don't realize

146
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,561
all that.

147
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:18,430
Put all that shit aside
and observe his movements,

148
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,620
observe his movements in a fight like
in the Michael Johnson fight in the,

149
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:23,980
uh,

150
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,570
the gummy fight in the markets.

151
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:25,921
Dave,

152
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:27,700
his fight in the gray Maynard fight.

153
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,350
Observe his movements.

154
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,970
He's a motherfucker dude.

155
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,740
When he tees off on you,

156
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,690
he comes at you like a snake.

157
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,840
He's got long ass on the most connections
of all time where it's like 80% of his

158
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,940
strucks hit strikes
hit in the first round.

159
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:43,840
He Lit Donald Up.

160
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:43,991
Yeah.

161
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:44,261
It was like,

162
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:44,910
what the fuck?

163
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,000
He nothing missed.

164
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,140
He let Donald Up.

165
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,700
He fucked Donald up in that first round.

166
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,730
Donald Donald Donald started
coming back with leg kicks.

167
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,260
The only guy who's ever
really successfully like
put him away in the UFC was

168
00:04:56,261 --> 00:05:00,400
Josh Thompson and Josh Thompson is
one of the most underrated guys.

169
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,540
He's,

170
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,650
he's Josh Thompson.

171
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:06,910
When he was at his best left to go over
strike force and a lot of people missed

172
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:09,550
out on some of the fucking
wars that he had over there.

173
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,130
And the Gilbert Melendez fights
over there and he went through,

174
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:12,370
you know,

175
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,600
a lot of wear and tear on you.

176
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,430
But like skill for skill.

177
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,710
Josh Thompson is a
motherfucker but he's now,

178
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:22,630
he's like 36 time just starts to
get everybody but at his best.

179
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,260
And I think that like his last fight
with Nate Diaz when he had kicked,

180
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:27,100
I mean he stopped him.

181
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,650
It was one of his best performances ever.

182
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,600
And then they had some losses after that,

183
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:31,961
but it can't,

184
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:35,170
it's like it's hard to stay healthy and
get through a camp when you're 36 years

185
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:35,441
old.

186
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:38,680
When those guys get to the late
thirties things start to get,

187
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,090
so he has one loss.

188
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:41,890
But the loss in my opinion,

189
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,090
I mean one stoppage loss,

190
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,770
but the loss to Thompson is like,

191
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,570
well he's one of the most underrated guys.

192
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,680
So it's like solid loss.

193
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,521
Fuck yeah,

194
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,151
it doesn't get,

195
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,220
doesn't get looked at as
solid as it should be.

196
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,980
I think Thompson at its
best is he's a motherfucker.

197
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,520
So if,

198
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:54,761
okay,

199
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:56,290
so let's say he's a natural one 70,

200
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,220
or let's say he wants to fight the Conor,

201
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,571
he's not,

202
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:02,750
he just wants to fight this fight at
one 70 and prove his point that he could

203
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,710
win point to fight exactly the way they
did it before and to come in and fight

204
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,240
in.

205
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,000
This is what happened.

206
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,820
If they're going to do that
in the meantime there's
lit Frankie and Aldo fight

207
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:11,654
for a title.

208
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,200
I agree.

209
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,620
How long are you gonna vacate the belt
that you haven't defended once Max

210
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,700
Holloway should be in the mix as well?

211
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,480
You know,

212
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,220
I think they also offered,

213
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,930
although a shot at Mcgregor
and he didn't take it,

214
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:23,470
uh,

215
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,650
it could it be a Brazilian thing,

216
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,490
if you know what I mean.

217
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,420
Oh,

218
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,740
what is that?

219
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,573
And steroids,

220
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,910
like you made the injection heroin,

221
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,530
they'll do that.

222
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,363
They still do that,

223
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,530
but for sure it,

224
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,670
uh,

225
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,480
I would say it was more like he's just
an unprepared and out of shape and they

226
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,530
want to get knocked out again.

227
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,741
I mean,

228
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,710
the guy just knocked him out with why
fucking punch a couple of months ago.

229
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,670
I remember,

230
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,001
but I mean,

231
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,420
he's like,

232
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,820
give me that rematch
because it can be imagined.

233
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,310
No,

234
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:46,581
see,

235
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:49,520
he didn't know that Connor
was going to get worked.

236
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,380
When of got worked by Nate Diaz.

237
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,430
It changed the whole game.

238
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,670
It's like,

239
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:52,821
oh,

240
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,654
I can change.

241
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,710
Everything changed,

242
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,041
man.

243
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,740
Everything changed in
everyone's approach to him.

244
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,860
When you watch a guy get beat
up and strangled like that,

245
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,853
you gotta pee again.

246
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,510
Go ahead and do it.

247
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:02,751
Go ahead.

248
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:03,584
Do it.

249
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,820
Talking about this.

250
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,653
Don't worry about it man.

251
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,420
But my point is for the folks listing,

252
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,580
when you watch a guy get beat up,

253
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,530
like Conor got beat up against Nate and
he shoots for a take down and then it

254
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:16,100
gets taken down naked on top of them,

255
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,280
beats him up and then chokes
him a taps real quick.

256
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,630
Like Nate just dominated them.

257
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:21,464
Once it got to the ground,

258
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,161
he was already hurt.

259
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:22,994
When it got to the ground,

260
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,410
then everybody goes,

261
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,100
hmm,

262
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,933
okay.

263
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,730
Could Hofeld dos Anjos do this?

264
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:29,450
Could.

265
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,650
And for a guy like Conor,

266
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:34,340
I think one of the reasons why he wants
his fight back is to prove that he

267
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:35,174
fucked up,

268
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,570
that he tried to take Nate
out with big power bombs.

269
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:39,470
He gassed out,

270
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,860
he got tired and then Nate boxed
him up in the second round.

271
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,450
Nate start tagging him,

272
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,370
had him hurt and had
them shoot for takedown.

273
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,320
So a guy like Conor,

274
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,880
you don't get to be that good.

275
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,020
You don't get to be that far.

276
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,820
You don't get to be that successful.

277
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,640
You don't get to knock out all though
with one punch at beat the fuck out of

278
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,810
[inaudible] in the first round,

279
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,560
like you called it and beat the shit out
of Seaver and stopped Chad Mendez when

280
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,150
you wanted to bet
millions of dollars on it.

281
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:02,510
I mean,

282
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,900
he's a legit 100% motherfucker,

283
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,140
but the game does not
care about personalities.

284
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:16,390
The game does not care about confidence
to interaction of fists and face and

285
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,580
chokes and next and kicks and bodies.

286
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,850
It does not care about
anything other than what works.

287
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,810
So like when you see it,

288
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,200
a loss like a Rhonda Rousey getting
knocked the fuck out by Holly Holm,

289
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,050
it does not mean that Ronda Rousey sucks.

290
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,390
It does not mean that Holly
Holm is the greatest ever.

291
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,300
It just means that the game
doesn't give a fuck who you are.

292
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,381
It doesn't care.

293
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:40,520
You want to charge face first at a counter
striker and she clips you with that

294
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,354
first punch.

295
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,810
Your are ready at CEC or already at check,

296
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,560
you got rocked like the first punch and
then you're getting beat up for four and

297
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:51,410
a half minutes after that and then
the second round comes around.

298
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:53,510
You don't even know
where the fuck you are.

299
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,570
Your ears are going.

300
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,523
That's it.

301
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,130
You can't see your
fucking eyes are blurry.

302
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,330
It must be so weird.

303
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,110
Terrifying.

304
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,270
That's what I love about
UFC as opposed to boxing.

305
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,830
Nobody goes 29 to no,

306
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,940
no.

307
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,650
I mean if you go six in a row,

308
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,400
that's like,

309
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,060
wow.

310
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,900
That's why John Jones,

311
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:12,734
it's so spooky.

312
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,340
Yeah.

313
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,600
Nobody's beating Jon Jones.

314
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,170
Jon Jones.

315
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,480
Jon Jones has one loss and
it's a disqualification.

316
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:20,180
It's Matt Hamill and where
he was caressing him.

317
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:20,720
Yeah.

318
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,710
On top of them.

319
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,371
And it was a,

320
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:23,510
it's a dumb rule.

321
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,540
It's like a 12 to six
elbows from on a clock face.

322
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,400
If you drop an elbow down from 12 to six,

323
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,950
the people that made the rules thought
that that's somehow or another,

324
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:31,784
it was dangerous.

325
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,700
It's no different than
any other kind of elbows.

326
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,543
It's just,

327
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:34,950
yeah,

328
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,840
it's a stupid rule.

329
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,300
It's a rule that they put in place
because the people that were on the

330
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:39,020
commission,

331
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,940
this is coming from big
John McCarthy himself.

332
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,430
The people that were on
the commission at the time,

333
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,091
they,

334
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:44,810
um,

335
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,970
they thought that if you
dropped a 12 to six elbow,

336
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:48,660
like those ESPN karate shows,

337
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,300
he could break bricks and shit.

338
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,170
You could kill somebody.

339
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,910
So they,

340
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,744
uh,

341
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,250
they made it illegal.

342
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:55,731
Meanwhile,

343
00:09:55,731 --> 00:09:56,750
it's not even 12 to six.

344
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:57,860
It's like one to seven.

345
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,360
It's stupid.

346
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
It's stupid.

347
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,491
He really,

348
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:02,270
I could fight again.

349
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,340
It's really almost never 12 to six.

350
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:05,900
It's always at a slight angle,

351
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,520
but either way it's fucking dumb.

352
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:08,270
It's a dumb rule.

353
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,103
It doesn't make any sense.

354
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,970
Yeah.

355
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,803
Um,

356
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,291
by the way,

357
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:15,160
we have Nate Diaz calling
indoors sports podcast.

358
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:17,720
Punchdrunk sports id
really well fake Nick Diaz.

359
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,070
Nate Diaz fake.

360
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,790
They always call.

361
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,650
I'm glad you had to fake.

362
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,693
How good are they?

363
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,480
The fake ones.

364
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:22,900
Yeah.

365
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,410
Amazing.

366
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:23,910
Really.

367
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:24,820
All the accents are great.

368
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,380
And they talked about
two oh nine somewhat.

369
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,420
They're always talking about
they're going pontoon boat shopping.

370
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,971
Where are you?

371
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:31,450
Come on.

372
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,070
Come on.

373
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,591
Got It here.

374
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:33,340
I'm mad.

375
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,911
They're great.

376
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:34,331
It's Danish.

377
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:34,511
No,

378
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:34,811
Neil.

379
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:36,070
And they're so fucking good at it.

380
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:40,330
For a while they were dating Ronda Rousey
and GSP was all upset about it because

381
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:41,770
he wanted to date Ronda Rousey and they,

382
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,220
they catfished him and buried
him and buried him in a,

383
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:44,670
uh,

384
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,000
on a,

385
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,140
a refrigerator box and the desert.

386
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,123
He got out.

387
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,080
And now GSP is addicted
to kitty litter pick.

388
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Could you let her computers break
talking to the aliens all the time?

389
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,500
They told me I missed
the 2:00 AM two minutes,

390
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,523
my life.

391
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,170
That's hilarious.

392
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:02,730
I've got to hit,

393
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,490
is that on,

394
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,480
on youtube anywhere?

395
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,140
Uh,

396
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,561
no.

397
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:08,260
Not Youtube but punchdrunk
sports.com I think he'd get clips.

398
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,011
The daily motion was,

399
00:11:09,011 --> 00:11:10,210
I think they're all in daily motion,

400
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,920
Dave.

401
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,753
Any of that stuff.

402
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:11,831
Yeah.

403
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:13,270
We got to click that
Shit and put it on mute.

404
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:13,861
Yeah.

405
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:14,760
Why don't you have clips?

406
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,460
I just don't like,

407
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,170
yeah.

408
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:18,810
I mean there's no,

409
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:23,450
I can't give you a good reason that this
is the reason why I think the rematches

410
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,383
is huge.

411
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
This is why you have to do it.

412
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:25,830
Okay.

413
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,461
First of all,

414
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,540
because Conor Mcgregor,

415
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,090
up until that fight is one of the most
spectacular fighters ever tag people were

416
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,120
talking about him.

417
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:33,430
Yeah.

418
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:36,600
Just the spectacle in
that sense of spectacular.

419
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:40,380
The guy gets on stage and screams the
lands and the crowd goes nuts in the Irish

420
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:40,830
flags.

421
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,010
Right.

422
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,910
Galvanized the nation.

423
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:42,960
And I don't even know what galvanize

424
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:43,611
it means.

425
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:46,100
Like a coating when you get
nail so they don't rust.

426
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:46,760
Okay.

427
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,510
Um,

428
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,280
he's spectacular.

429
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:49,790
Right.

430
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,670
And his results inside the Ark
gut other than Nate Diaz fight,

431
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,460
had incredibly dramatic calling.

432
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:55,151
Exactly.

433
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:55,984
Second,

434
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,740
second round,

435
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,390
I'll kill him with an
uppercut and knock him out.

436
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:58,871
And then it's like,

437
00:11:58,871 --> 00:11:59,650
what?

438
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,250
But when a guy like Nate Diaz beat you,

439
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,161
beat you,

440
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:04,270
the way he beat you,

441
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,000
the bright thing to do
is to have a rematch.

442
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,863
And this why?

443
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,690
Because the rematch is
where the big money's at.

444
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,740
The Murray match with Nate
Diaz is God damn scrooge.

445
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:16,540
Mcduck gigantic die.

446
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:17,374
Huge.

447
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,740
2 million plus paper view of eyes.

448
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,620
It's still on the table.

449
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,280
If it goes,

450
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,890
let's just say it goes to
45 then maybe 55 again,

451
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,030
there's always going to be like,

452
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,181
well,

453
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:26,270
I mean they DSL pitcher,

454
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,501
you know.

455
00:12:26,501 --> 00:12:27,310
Exactly.

456
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,180
Not only that,

457
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,230
but here's the other problem.

458
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,820
What Frankie might beat him.

459
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,370
Sure.

460
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,330
Everyone Holloway.

461
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,050
Max Holloway might beat him in a rematch.

462
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,180
Who knows?

463
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,850
Yeah.

464
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,230
Jose Aldo might beat them now.

465
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,260
Now that Joseph especially
Jolen we all know

466
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,430
Josie Aldo.

467
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,150
Yeah,

468
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,990
it comes in real healthy.

469
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,833
You know what I'm saying?

470
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,123
If he

471
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:49,910
chose a,

472
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,730
although he is a fucking nine
year undefeated all time,

473
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,980
great fighter who got
clipped with one big punch.

474
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,750
So what if Aldo fights like in a
similar way to how Misha Tate fought.

475
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:03,370
Holly Holm takes his time.

476
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,660
Where's that motherfucker out?

477
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:07,720
And like round two or three and just stays
on the outside and leg kicks the shit

478
00:13:07,721 --> 00:13:10,030
out of him if all don't
just choose just to have,

479
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:11,080
I mean all it was so mad.

480
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,480
He tried to take his head off with
a left hook and he got clipped.

481
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,010
He would load it up and he got clipped.

482
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,240
But what if he doesn't do that?

483
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,370
What if he goes in there and
play slow on the outside?

484
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:19,240
Starts kicking his legs?

485
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,680
What if he initiates a clinch?

486
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,840
Cause let me tell you something
about all those Jujitsu.

487
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,870
It's fucking world class like you watch
or Aldo versus Mike Brown in the UFC or

488
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:30,910
the WC rather when he wanted to Walter,

489
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,980
they'll featherweight
title can't get anything.

490
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:33,370
Right.

491
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,660
When he won the featherweight title to it,

492
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:38,470
he takes his back like a fucking
world champion and smashes him.

493
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,510
So a cyborgs in the UFC now too.

494
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,823
That's amazing.

495
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,641
I just heard that from you.

496
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:43,474
We're open pool.

497
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,140
You know?

498
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:44,973
Finally,

499
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,473
finally.

500
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:46,960
Yeah.

501
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,180
At one 41 40 yeah.

502
00:13:49,181 --> 00:13:50,700
The pro rada thoughts finds it.

503
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,030
35 yes.

504
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,110
And she's going to fight Leslie
Smith who fights at one 35 she's,

505
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,040
it's the girl at her ear exploded
or year got torn off by Jessica.

506
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:00,874
I,

507
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,713
what's the problem?

508
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:02,801
Uh,

509
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,330
well it's not a problem,

510
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,650
but it's a one 40 pound weight class
instead of a one 45 that's the one 45 is

511
00:14:08,651 --> 00:14:10,150
what she's champion of in Invicta.

512
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,020
And I think the idea is that they worry
that they don't have enough 145 pound

513
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:14,854
talent.

514
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,660
I think they didn't have enough hunter
[inaudible] I know for sure that it

515
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,450
didn't have 115 pound talent.

516
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,810
Some of the third bout to get somebody
a third rematch in five years.

517
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,500
Like,

518
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,340
come on man.

519
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,781
But you mean me?

520
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:32,380
She taped it was like you don't have a
deep enough way class if that's what you

521
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:33,040
keep doing.

522
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,671
Well,

523
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,361
sort of,

524
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:36,880
but I mean that's the same problem
they're going to have right now at

525
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:37,660
welterweight.

526
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,050
The same problem you're talking about
at one 45 which has a lot of talent.

527
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,220
There's a lot of talented one 45 in men's.

528
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,550
So this is what I think.

529
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,091
I think,

530
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:46,450
uh,

531
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,283
first of all,

532
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,580
she's fucking terrifying.

533
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:52,640
I want to talk about like one
of the scariest strikers in MMA,

534
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,301
cyborgs.

535
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:53,990
Terrifying.

536
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,790
And Tony and I got in trouble because we,

537
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:55,940
uh,

538
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,810
said some inappropriate jokes about
what would a roast w be like with her.

539
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,010
All jokes aside,

540
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,770
even before that I had tweeted that a,

541
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:06,090
I would love to see her
in the UFC for sure.

542
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:06,951
She's name,

543
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:07,641
she's a monster.

544
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:11,540
And I think also we shouldn't have
double standards as far as who takes

545
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,650
performance enhancing drugs,

546
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:13,820
whether it's for men or for women,

547
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,000
like,

548
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,280
oh,

549
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:15,500
they,

550
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,900
like things are kind of is I
think the way people look at it,

551
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,510
what a woman is taking testosterone
versus a man taking testosterone because

552
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,410
it's already part of your body.

553
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,363
Yeah.

554
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,181
But you know,

555
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:26,571
honestly,

556
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:29,270
like some of the things that men have
been caught with have been pretty

557
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,350
unnatural as well.

558
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:34,190
Like super human levels of testosterone
that don't even exist in medical books,

559
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:34,881
you know?

560
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:36,410
So it's,

561
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,340
you could argue that it's dangerous
because a woman does change her anatomy.

562
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,420
Whatever they're testing are now.

563
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:41,780
Yeah.

564
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,070
But your anatomy changes.

565
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:43,370
Oh,

566
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:43,790
right.

567
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,530
But you have to make a weight class.

568
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,271
It's,

569
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:47,000
it's tricky man.

570
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,241
I mean,

571
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:51,200
it always seen before this Holly Holm
thing happened and that's all fishy too.

572
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,303
What's fishy?

573
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,430
Rhonda won't take a fight,

574
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,670
won't take a fight against Holly Holm,

575
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:56,840
and then it's suddenly like Misha Tate.

576
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,170
When's like,

577
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,003
I'm ready to fight now.

578
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,430
It's like,

579
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,761
oh no.

580
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,170
She's not necessarily ready to fight now.

581
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:00,621
No,

582
00:16:00,621 --> 00:16:01,070
she,

583
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:01,640
she's not,

584
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,020
she can't fight until like November.

585
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,883
She is,

586
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,300
she's gotten movie obligations.

587
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,140
They got moved around.

588
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,730
See that's bad right there,

589
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,650
right when the movies get in the way.

590
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,400
Yeah.

591
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,390
Of your fights.

592
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,950
Like you gotta pick one or the other.

593
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,813
So in between,

594
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,813
yeah,

595
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,710
I,

596
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:16,760
as soon as my fights over,

597
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,830
I can do your movie for the next three
months and then I got her back to

598
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:19,280
training.

599
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,880
It's gotta be hard though when you're a,

600
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:21,681
you know,

601
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,340
a super celebrity and you're getting
all this love and everybody wants to put

602
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:26,300
you in all these different things.

603
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:28,250
It's gotta be hard to say no
to certain things obviously.

604
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:29,061
But the same shit happens.

605
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:29,900
A female comics.

606
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,261
Yeah.

607
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:33,920
But it's way worse with a fighter because
of fighter has to be physically tuned

608
00:16:33,921 --> 00:16:37,010
up to go in to do battle and
get kicked in the fucking,

609
00:16:37,011 --> 00:16:37,131
yeah.

610
00:16:37,131 --> 00:16:37,710
It's way worse.

611
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,110
A fighter.

612
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:41,060
It's just similar where it's like you're
not concentrating on the thing that got

613
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:41,570
you there.

614
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,220
So the thing that got you
there is now suffering.

615
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:43,940
Yeah.

616
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,720
Maybe you don't care anymore.

617
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,650
Maybe you just want to do movies.

618
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,513
Okay.

619
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,340
Okay.
