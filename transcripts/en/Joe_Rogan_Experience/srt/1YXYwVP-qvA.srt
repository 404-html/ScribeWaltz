1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,780
Try by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:04,951
It was a,

3
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:06,000
that was a nutty scene,

4
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:06,600
man.

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,030
Being there and the Wayans felt surreal.

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,150
It felt really nice.

7
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,641
Friendly.

8
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:10,980
It's,

9
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,610
it happened.

10
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,120
Yeah.

11
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,541
It was like,

12
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,590
it was crazy.

13
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,380
Like the weight of the
event was thick in the air.

14
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:19,500
It had this feel to it that
was very different than any
other show we'd ever put

15
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:20,130
together.

16
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,851
I wish I was there that,

17
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:21,451
that's the one show.

18
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,440
I wish I was that because
it was so special.

19
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,870
It's going to be tough to beat that,

20
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,630
but it'll never be you.

21
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:26,941
I mean,

22
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:28,680
you'll have big giant events for sure,

23
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,550
but it'll never be like that because
that was the last block of corruption.

24
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,001
Correct.

25
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,230
I was standing in front of the UFC,

26
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,220
getting into New York.

27
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,990
I got a little worried when I saw,

28
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,291
uh,

29
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:37,621
where was,

30
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,910
I think I was in Atlanta doing live show.

31
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,040
I saw on the,

32
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,241
on the Twitter,

33
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:45,780
like the crazy press conference
with Connor doing that stuff.

34
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:46,020
I'm like,

35
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,241
no,

36
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm not.

37
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,700
And it was kind of weird.

38
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:47,911
I was like,

39
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:48,091
well,

40
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,170
it seems a little gimmicky,

41
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:49,351
blah,

42
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:49,501
blah,

43
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,334
blah.

44
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,430
And then the way he looked a little
more serious and then the night of the

45
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:53,761
fight,

46
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:54,480
I was like,

47
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,721
I mean,

48
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,970
you couldn't have written a better show.

49
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,670
I mean,

50
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,150
the,

51
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,360
the,

52
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,820
the fights that night,

53
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,110
the way everything happened,

54
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,280
it was amazing.

55
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:03,690
Man by amazing bar,

56
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,220
the best UFC I've ever seen.

57
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,690
It was by far the,

58
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,850
the main event was almost,

59
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,130
it was almost bizarre.

60
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,430
It's almost bizarre how good Connors,

61
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,620
almost bizarre the way he
picked apart Eddie Alvarez.

62
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,180
Almost bizarre.

63
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,710
Like magical.

64
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,110
That's almost the word I wanna use.

65
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:21,780
Correct.

66
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,180
Like he touches motherfuckers.

67
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,120
Would that left hand?

68
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,150
Have you ever seen any average?

69
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,340
Just like they didn't even look
like they were in the same planet.

70
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,180
Like one guy,

71
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,010
like look like he was from Mars.

72
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:34,770
The other guy look like he's just a
normal dude trying to figure it out.

73
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,981
Well,

74
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:35,970
it looked like Eddie,

75
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,260
the moment he got hit with like,

76
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,000
what the fuck you could see on his face.

77
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:39,271
He was like,

78
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,410
holy,

79
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,460
but Jesus,

80
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:42,180
what am I doing here?

81
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,810
And then he goes,

82
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,230
well,

83
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,590
all right,

84
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,951
he does.

85
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,000
He's not very good at wrestling.

86
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,790
We try this wrestling cutters
like that was your shot,

87
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,541
I'll bro,

88
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,380
you're in for a long night.

89
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,580
I think that he realized like,

90
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,820
Holy Fuck boys already touched up a
little bit when he finally went in for the

91
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,654
shot,

92
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,171
you know?

93
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,570
And I just think I'm Connor new.

94
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:00,360
Then also that he had
them and how calm was he?

95
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,021
Ridiculous.

96
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,120
Just calm upright and just waiting.

97
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,870
And then the accuracy of that
Combo that finally finished Eddie.

98
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,050
That's what I think makes Connor
show specials is accuracy.

99
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,070
When he throws punches,

100
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,340
Eddie's moving as he's
laying in this stuff.

101
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:15,330
I've never seen anything like,

102
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,100
like you said,

103
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,610
it was straight up magical.

104
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:18,100
I'm like,

105
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,391
all right,

106
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:20,010
well we've never seen a guy like this.

107
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:20,760
We just have it.

108
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,481
I don't know if we ever,

109
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:22,040
well either.

110
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
It was really interesting too when I
was interviewing him and he's like,

111
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,350
you've gotta have some attributes.

112
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,101
If you want to beat me,

113
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:26,790
you gotta be tall.

114
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,623
You've got to be big.

115
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,231
It can me.

116
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,490
These guys my size,

117
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,890
what he's doing though,

118
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:32,170
it,

119
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,180
it's so,

120
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,440
he's a once in a lifetime guy
because he sent in the ceiling.

121
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,250
Like there's no,

122
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,480
there's no boundaries for him.

123
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:40,380
Like he's just like,

124
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,650
I'll fight Nate at 70 I'll be 45 sure
on merch Aldo in 13 seconds and they'll

125
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:51,150
come to 55 like we've never seen this
kind of creativity and we've often never

126
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,070
seen the UFC allow
someone to do this either.

127
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:53,581
Yeah.

128
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:55,350
Well he's just such a unique personality.

129
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:56,190
It's undeniable,

130
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:59,010
but also his style in a lot of ways.

131
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,430
He kind of does a lot of
lightweight Wonderboy does,

132
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,050
but with less kicks,

133
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,670
like he throws kicks to the body,

134
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,870
I'll throw it some front kicks.

135
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:08,081
I mean,

136
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:08,351
you know,

137
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,030
like maybe 70% has many kicks.

138
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,920
Wonderboy is a little more kick heavy,

139
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,610
but it's that sideway style and he's,

140
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,270
but he,

141
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,471
he,

142
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:17,770
I think he does it better.

143
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,810
Like there's maybe something about the
focus of the shots that he's landing,

144
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,370
the precision of them,

145
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,830
cause Wonderboy very rarely like touches
somebody up like that with a punch.

146
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:30,190
He just doesn't have that kind of power.

147
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,341
Yeah,

148
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:30,930
you're right.

149
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,020
I think Wonderboy is better at surprising
guys with his kicks in his ankles,

150
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,140
but commerce set it up and he's landing
combos that are all so precise in this

151
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:40,900
power,

152
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,920
like he's touching dudes and you can
see it on their face touched Eddie and

153
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:45,400
Eddie's like,

154
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,360
what duff?

155
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:46,691
Well,

156
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:47,251
not only that,

157
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:47,681
and he's like,

158
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,430
he's hitting him in a surprise
way is not telegraphing it at all.

159
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,580
Like his ability to like go from bouncing
around to launching that shot is so

160
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,774
quick.

161
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,501
It's so,

162
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:04,270
it's so precise and it's so focused
and there's no fat in his movements.

163
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,590
It's just yet,

164
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,530
and they said there's gonna be a
big announcement afterwards enough,

165
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,580
these girls pregnant,

166
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,280
which I mean it's a personal
big announcement for him,

167
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,370
but I think he's,

168
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,910
he said he's going to take time off
and he wants a piece of the pie.

169
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,060
He wants a piece of WME and what,

170
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,420
you know what they're doing now,

171
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,283
which,

172
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,580
which is hilarious.

173
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,120
Right.

174
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,690
I love it.

175
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,051
Me Too.

176
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:23,531
I love it.

177
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,680
And he's the first fighter
ever that can talk like this.

178
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:31,681
How old is he was kind of 26 maybe 27 26

179
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,930
gotta think 28 I think
he's a smart guy too.

180
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,471
I don't,

181
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:42,010
I mean I would hope at least I don't
see him fight and deep into his thirties

182
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,761
no,

183
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,110
especially the way he
talked because he goes,

184
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,040
now that I have a kid,

185
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,540
I know what I bring to the table.

186
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,510
I won't be set financially
for the rest of my life.

187
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,810
You guys want me to fight again?

188
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,571
You know I'm leaving.

189
00:04:50,571 --> 00:04:51,760
You need to be set for
the rest of my life.

190
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,240
I want to,

191
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,950
I want to part of this pie and he's,

192
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:57,730
he's his next fight and it's going
to be such a fight is with WME.

193
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,020
It's not with anyone out there.

194
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,350
If you think he's fighting
for and it could be next.

195
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,560
You're batshit crazy.

196
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,390
That's not happening for a very long time.

197
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,291
Maybe.

198
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,124
Maybe they work it out.

199
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,971
I don't think so.

200
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:07,840
I think the next slide,

201
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,171
again,

202
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:08,651
I don't know.

203
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:11,020
This is just me going off
whatever the hell I think Joe,

204
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:15,400
but I think his next fight would be Nate
for the belt at 55 because if you think

205
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:15,760
if you like,

206
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,511
it could be even Tony,

207
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,160
they're both deserving and we're MMA.

208
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,200
Pierce were balls deep in MMA.

209
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:22,720
We love it and one of
those guys deserves it.

210
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,780
As far as numbers and
and in a big paper view,

211
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,120
it would have to be native to really
think they would do Nate again,

212
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,280
100% wow.

213
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,560
I don't think Nader economy will
fight unless it's an if it's,

214
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:32,950
that's the,

215
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,080
if that has to be the matchup,

216
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,160
I think Connor will fight someone else.

217
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,520
I think Connor might
even fight Woodley you.

218
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,640
I think you'd see a fight with Woodley
before you see could be by Ferguson I

219
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,930
think could be in first and will
fight each other before anything else.

220
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,890
Do you know how fucking crazy it would
be if he decided to go up and fight

221
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:48,724
Woodley?

222
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,770
It's so nice.

223
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,660
Obviously Willie has get
through Wonderboy again,

224
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:53,720
but it doesn't,

225
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,800
it has to.

226
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,450
You think so?

227
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:56,283
Well we'll,

228
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,970
Dana said that's an immediate rematch.

229
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,810
A lot of shit.

230
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,670
He says God is fighting for the title.

231
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,360
It's good point.

232
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,691
It was like,

233
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:03,220
Nah,

234
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,190
we sure you're fighting for a title.

235
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,053
Nah.

236
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,421
Yeah,

237
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,410
he does that all the time.

238
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,460
I don't think that means anything.

239
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,201
Thanks.

240
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:08,990
Good point.

241
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,730
I'm just going based
off what your boys said.

242
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,271
He was like,

243
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,110
that's the next rematch,

244
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,010
but put it on me

245
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,250
more your friend than mine.

246
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,800
Your you've worked on forever.

247
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,313
Yeah.

248
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah.

249
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,900
I liked it and I just think you
know you have a closer relationship,

250
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,960
so let's say you're a boy,

251
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,110
but he does say things and pulls back.

252
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,380
Yeah.

253
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,120
If if Woodley and that's there.

254
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,980
This other thing you got
to worry about though,

255
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,281
not,

256
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,080
you don't have to worry about
something to think about.

257
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,210
How much power or are they going to give
Connor 45 55 70 just wraps up all the

258
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:38,750
dude.

259
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,310
Do you know how crazy that
would be if he did it though?

260
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,570
I say let them do it.

261
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,301
Let them try it.

262
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:42,591
UFC,

263
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:42,841
he's going,

264
00:06:42,841 --> 00:06:43,311
we can't,

265
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,000
he's going to take this pitch Woodley.

266
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,291
We'll say,

267
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,040
let him try.

268
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,611
Fuck yeah.

269
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,301
Woodlea say,

270
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,220
let him try whether we'd love that dude.

271
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:49,731
How crazy.

272
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,960
That mass square garden and after the
fight the lights on the state in which

273
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:55,220
they've never done before in the arena.

274
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,420
We're Irish colors.

275
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,060
It was pretty intense.

276
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,610
Do you,

277
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,360
and Brian and I were arguing this,

278
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,200
do you think Conor McGregor is more
well known than Floyd Mayweather?

279
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,090
Currently?

280
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:08,923
Yes.

281
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,080
Because boxing's a bigger sport.

282
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,680
Yeah.

283
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,760
Cause you look at,

284
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,800
did you look at Floyd
Manny like the paper,

285
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,980
your numbers destroys anything
cottage or been close to.

286
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,843
That's true.

287
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,953
Maybe not.

288
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,291
Maybe.

289
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,124
No.

290
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,750
I was arguing Connor is bigger.

291
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,980
He loves social media,

292
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:25,760
stuff like that.

293
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,700
But Floyd has more
followers and on Instagram,

294
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:28,921
Twitter.

295
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:29,970
But you can't judge it off that.

296
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,531
Here's the thing,

297
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:34,820
the amount of excitement that Floyd
generates does not even fucking compare to

298
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,470
the amount of excitement
that Connor generates.

299
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,620
It doesn't mean he's more popular.

300
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,180
Understand,

301
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,140
but it does kind of,

302
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,880
because the intensity of the popularity,

303
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:43,400
the love people might know
who Floyd Mayweather is,

304
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,160
but when it comes to how many
people love Floyd Mayweather,

305
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,480
it's not even close.

306
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,160
He might be like some ridiculous 10 to
one or 20 to one because when Connor gets

307
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:52,581
out there,

308
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,380
they go fucking crazy.

309
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:54,741
Crazy.

310
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,110
How many people were there
to see Floyd Mayweather lose?

311
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,920
How many people were bored after Floyd
Mayweather fights like Floyd Mayweather

312
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:04,670
fights so skillfully and surgically that
and doesn't take any chances for hardly

313
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,330
ever gets hit.

314
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,370
It's not Connor Merck's motherfuckers.

315
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,030
He wins the world title and the fastest
ever title winning knockout ever.

316
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,170
What did you do after that?

317
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,450
He comes back and makes
Eddie Alvarez look.

318
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,950
Eddie Alvarez world champion,

319
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,760
the guy was,

320
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,690
he's defending hall of Fame Hall of Famer
and Connor makes him look like he has

321
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:21,950
no business in there with them.

322
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,040
No business has zero success at all
except for a couple of body shots.

323
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:30,100
This is why I think Connor's bigger
and more trend descent because you just

324
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:31,010
bailed on that word.

325
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,490
I did.

326
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:31,791
Sorry.

327
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,550
Marin's send a transcendent
p because I just bailed.

328
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:34,790
Right?

329
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,440
Just fucking out like that.

330
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:37,400
Sometimes I'll just like,

331
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,280
yeah,

332
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:38,871
I was like,

333
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:39,770
I think I'm using it wrong.

334
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:41,920
[inaudible]

335
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,610
out and operation.

336
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:44,444
He Jacks.

337
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,860
Um,

338
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,860
but how many successful black
athletes do we know of Joe Galen?

339
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,920
How many white Irish
superstars do we know?

340
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:55,920
One?

341
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,131
Yeah.

342
00:08:56,131 --> 00:09:00,900
One one weekend was a big star before
he came to the United States and he came

343
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,330
to the United States and
eventually lost his belt.

344
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,600
But Barry Mcwiggin at one
point in time was a huge star,

345
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:10,510
but nowhere near [inaudible]
the connoisseur worldwide in,

346
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,380
in this,

347
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:12,750
it goes for all athletes.

348
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,380
Connors,

349
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,820
the green elephant in the room,

350
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,200
everyone else we've seen before,

351
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,090
every once we know what
they can kind of do.

352
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:18,690
Connors,

353
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:22,530
this green elephant amongst all these
gray elephants and there's nothing like

354
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:22,800
him.

355
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,580
Totally different.

356
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,450
Totally different animal.

357
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,231
It's crazy.

358
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,870
He's elephant with two fucking trunks.

359
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,241
Got It.

360
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:28,320
15 decks,

361
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,020
15 days to China,

362
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,590
gold with a Leprechaun outfit,

363
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:32,424
our act.

364
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,030
And now he has a little son on the way
and they gave him a fucking Rolls Royce

365
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:36,864
with his face on it.

366
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,850
How crazy is that?

367
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,130
What's interesting is how
well he manages it all.

368
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,240
It's really interesting.

369
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:42,781
You know,

370
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:43,140
like the,

371
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,550
the pressure in particular,

372
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,940
he doesn't seem to have
a problem with it at all.

373
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:46,790
It's weird.

374
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,120
That's what makes him so special because
that magnitude and the pressure and he

375
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,240
has to deliver and he has to do
those antics and then back it up,

376
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,460
but he keeps pulling it off like
you at the press comes like,

377
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:57,721
all right,

378
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:58,830
this is stupid man.

379
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,000
This is getting old to me.

380
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,051
But then we pull it off.

381
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:01,291
I'm like,

382
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,150
that was brilliant and you know,

383
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,350
I mean the guy steps in,

384
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:05,300
he loses to ds,

385
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:05,521
right?

386
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,080
Takes the Diaz fight on short notice.

387
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:07,621
By the way,

388
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:08,940
after a staph infection,

389
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,620
here's something that a lot
of people don't even know.

390
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,950
He had a pretty significant staph
infection was on antibiotics until like I

391
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,330
think two weeks before the fight.

392
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,100
If you don't think that
drains your gas tank,

393
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,740
you never had a staph infection and
he never had to take antibiotics.

394
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,540
Antibiotics are brutal on your,

395
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,920
on your respiratory system.

396
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,660
They're brutal on your whole body.

397
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:25,400
It's just your body.

398
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,240
When your body is made up of all this
shit that you don't consider it to be you,

399
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,141
but it is you.

400
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:33,830
The stomach flora is a real part of you.

401
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:34,051
You know,

402
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:38,130
your body is essentially like an ecosystem
and when you have a staph infection,

403
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,510
staph infections are dangerous.

404
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,344
It's fuck.

405
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,860
And people die from them then.

406
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,400
So they hit you with some
heavy duty antibiotics.

407
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:47,190
I've had staff twice and it's not fun.

408
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,740
And the first time I had it
and I took the medication,

409
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,010
I couldn't believe how I felt so weird.

410
00:10:53,011 --> 00:10:54,120
I felt light headed.

411
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,171
I felt weak.

412
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:55,501
I was like,

413
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:55,921
Whoa,

414
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:56,700
I can drained.

415
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,060
Right.

416
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,080
You have no energy.

417
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:59,820
Super strong stuff too.

418
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,451
And I was like,

419
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:00,691
wow,

420
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,330
imagine this guy fighting
two weeks after that saying,

421
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,860
because there's no way you Pete correctly.

422
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,310
No.

423
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,270
So it comes from that.

424
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,580
And then he fights Nate again,

425
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,090
you know,

426
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,790
few months later in a fucking crazy
five round war and beats him by the

427
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:15,810
narrowest of margins.

428
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:16,290
Right.

429
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,100
Don't you agree?

430
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,581
Yeah.

431
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:18,960
Those are the very,

432
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:21,450
very close fight were some
people thought that Nate one,

433
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,913
I mean,

434
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,070
I thought there the decision was correct,

435
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,821
but I was like,

436
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:27,061
wow,

437
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,870
that's close fight.

438
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,880
So takes that fucking crazy chance.

439
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:30,750
Comes back at fights.

440
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:31,320
That guy.

441
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,410
He kind of weighed one 69 that's
what he weighed when he weighed in.

442
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,520
That's what he weighed during the fight,

443
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:37,350
and they want him to fight at 55 he goes,

444
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:37,451
no,

445
00:11:37,451 --> 00:11:37,531
no,

446
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:37,581
no,

447
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:37,651
no.

448
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:42,030
I can beat him at 70 let me do 70 Nate
wade probably around one 90 something.

449
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,330
Yeah,

450
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,111
I mean did I mean,

451
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,420
everybody says that Nate is 155 pounder.

452
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,930
He is 100% but he's a way bigger man.

453
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,880
They been then congress,

454
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,660
he just is,

455
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:51,961
you know,

456
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,680
so it's like,

457
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,600
who's going to weigh more
when they actually get in
there and Nate's gonna weigh

458
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,260
more.

459
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,260
So he does that and then goes
from there and just see starches.

460
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:06,490
Eddie Alvarez like a world beater
and just so relaxed and loosened.

461
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,920
They're so amazing.

462
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,510
Fucking Madonna was at the show.

463
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,950
Madonna was Madonna.

464
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,630
Madonna was at the fights.

465
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,830
How crazy is that?

466
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,300
Madonna's instagramming Mama.

467
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,370
We made it Mama.

468
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,630
We made this red penny night.

469
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,340
It's red panty night and Madonna,

470
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,160
Europe thinks she's single with a focus.

471
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,150
My second belt,

472
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,490
I envisioned this where the focus me,

473
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:28,360
belt nuts,

474
00:12:28,361 --> 00:12:28,740
man.

475
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,170
Yeah.

476
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,610
He's fucking actor,

477
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:30,940
man.

478
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,870
He's such a character.

479
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,730
And you know,

480
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,260
I thought he was gonna
make a big announcement.

481
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,240
I thought it's announcement
was he's going to retire,

482
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,470
but his nephew was like a life
I'm going to continue doing.

483
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,313
So you guys need to,

484
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,910
I need a share of the company.

485
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,511
Yeah.

486
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:46,000
That's probably what the announcement
was going to be all along.

487
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,440
You know that he wants a piece of the Pie.

488
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,220
I mean he's got an argument that he
probably should get a percentage of the

489
00:12:52,221 --> 00:12:53,740
promotion because the,

490
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,700
what they're selling is Conor McGregor
or selling the UFC plus Conor McGregor.

491
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,400
The question is how much of that card,

492
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,810
what would it be?

493
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,630
What would the paper,

494
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,940
we don't know what the numbers are.

495
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,100
So let's pretend the number is 2 million,

496
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,170
which would be like the
greatest card of all time.

497
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:08,321
Right?

498
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,280
It probably wouldn't hit that.

499
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,090
I don't know.

500
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,320
I bet it's in one seven.

501
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:12,790
Let's just say 2 million.

502
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,060
Cause it's easy to correct.

503
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:14,171
So,

504
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,004
so let's say that,

505
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,650
what percentage bought
it because it Connor,

506
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:18,670
it might be a million.

507
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:21,000
1 million plus for sure
might be 1 million,

508
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,060
1 million plus for sure.

509
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,890
1 million people might have bought the
paper view specifically because of one

510
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:27,724
human being.

511
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,750
That is not outrageous to say [inaudible]
but this is the other thing in

512
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,890
Connor's favorite name,

513
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:34,510
another star who can do that.
